* Apple’s (PRODUCT)RED contributions have topped $160 million.
* That’s according to both Tim Cook and the press release issued this morning announcing the new Leather Folio (PRODUCT)RED case for iPhone X and the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition models in a red and black glass enclosure.
* “Since partnering with (RED) in 2006, Apple has donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund, serving as the organization’s largest corporate donor,” Apple said.
* In March 2017, Apple announced that its (PRODUCT)RED contributions have topped $130 million, meaning its customers have helped raise a cool $30 million in a little more than a year. For some context, Apple raised $20 million for (RED) during the lucrative 2014 holiday season.
* Deborah Dugan, (RED)’s CEO, added:
* Today’s announcement is further evidence of Apple’s leadership in and commitment to the AIDS fight since the beginning of (RED) in 2006.
* The more than $160 million Apple has donated in the last 11 years today equates to more than 800 million days of lifesaving ARV medication that prevents the transmission of HIV from mothers to their babies.
* We’re honored that Apple has dedicated its resources to our purpose and can’t wait to see customers bring our mission to life through the purchase of iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition.
* Spearheaded by U2 frontman Bono, the (RED) initiative strives to fight preventable and treatable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

* The non-profit also provides testing, counseling, treatment and prevention programs for tens of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS, with a specific focus on eliminating transmission of the virus from moms to their babies.
* “Thanks to Apple customers around the world for helping raise more than $160 million for @RED, fighting the spread of HIV in Africa and bringing us closer to an AIDS-free generation,” Cook tweeted on Monday.
* Apple has a section on its webstore dedicated to (PRODUCT)RED products and accessories, such as special Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.
* When you purchase any of these products, Apple sends a monetary contribution to the Global Fund. They use 100% of that money to finance HIV/AIDS programs that help those affected by HIV in Ghana, Lesotho, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia.
