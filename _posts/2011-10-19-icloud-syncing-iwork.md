* Caught up in all of the hoopla about the iPhone 4S and iOS 5 was the release of an updated iWork suite for iOS.
* The new iWork features iCloud syncing compatibility, a feature that has been in beta for months, but was finally released to the public last week.
* Inside, we showcase iWork’s new cloud syncing functionality, which allows you to sync documents on your iPod touch, iPad, iPhone, and even your Mac in limited fashion…
* As you can see, iCloud syncing in iWork is pretty great; in fact, I think it’s an absolute game changing feature for avid users of the iWork suite.
* If there’s one thing I’d like to see, it’s integration with the actual OS X apps. Without this feature, it’s a couple notches short of perfection.
* Have you started taking advantage of all that iCloud has to offer, when it comes to creating and editing documents? If so, how are you enjoying it thus far?
