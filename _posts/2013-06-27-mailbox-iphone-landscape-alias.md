* A little over a week ago, the Mailbox team pushed out an app update that added support for portrait orientation mode on the iPad. It was a welcomed addition, but it left a lot of users wondering when the iPhone version would receive support for landscape mode.
* The team promised that the feature was in the works, and last night it delivered on that promise by posting a new version of Mailbox to the App Store. The update, which brings the app to 1.3.2, includes support for iPhone landscape mode and other enhancements…
* Here’s the 1.3.2 change log:
* – Landscape mode for iPhone – Gmail “send as” alias support – Bug fixes
* While the log is small, the changes listed are fairly significant. With the new landscape mode for iPhone, users can finally browse through their inboxes, read through emails, and more importantly compose emails, while holding their handset in a horizontal fashion.
* And for those unfamiliar with Gmail’s alias feature, it essentially allows you to send messages with another of your email addresses listed as the sender. Most folks use it to manage multiple email accounts from the Gmail interface, and it can be setup in Gmail settings.
* Various behind-the-scenes bug fixes round out today’s update for what I still believe is the best iOS email client to date. If you’re interested, you can find the Mailbox app in the App Store for free. It’s available for the iPhone, iPad, and a Mac version is in the works.
