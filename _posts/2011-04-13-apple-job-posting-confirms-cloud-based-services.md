* We’ve reported about the rumored MobileMe revamp and possible digital locker feature multiple times. It looks like if you are really concerned with what Apple’s new cloud-based services will look like, you can go give them your input first hand.
* This afternoon, a BGR reader spotted an Apple job listing requesting a Cloud Systems Software Engineer. The position is for a spot on a small team of programmers looking to form the foundation of new Apple products and services…
* Originally we thought that the new MobileMe with cloud-based digital locker services would be announced some time this month, but the live job posting suggests it may still be in early stages.
* Explore the far reaches of the possible by joining the team building the future of cloud services at Apple!
* Consider joining a small team writing the software which forms the foundation for some of our most exciting new products and services. We are looking for an extremely capable engineer who has a strong background in web services development, and who has built high-performance, scalable, and extensible systems. In this highly visible position, the successful candidate will collaborate with cross-functional engineering teams to define and implement some of the core backend platform frameworks and systems that will power next generation Apple web services.
* It looks like Apple is looking to make good use of those 12 Petabytes they recently ordered. While it’s obvious Apple has some sort of new cloud-based services coming, the questions “what?” and “when?” still remain. I’m hoping we see a MobileMe revamp with cloud-based storage and better iOS integration.
* What do you hope Apple’s new cloud-based services entail?
