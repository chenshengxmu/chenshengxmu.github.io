* iOS 12 is not expected to phase out older hardware such as iPhone 5s.
* As first noted Friday by French blog MacGeneration (Google Translate), WebKit’s mailing list mentions a test conducted in January that involved user agents identified as iOS 12 running on the iPhone 5s simulator, which mimics the iPhone 5s hardware in software.
* WebKit is the rendering engine behind Safari. Curiously, references to iOS 12 devices recently began appearing in web logs across the Internet, including in our own site analytics.
* 9to5Mac observes that if the report is true, then iPhone 5s will get a year of updates more than what both iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 got with five years of major iOS updates.
* For guidance, the following devices are officially supported by the current iOS 11 edition:
* Even if iOS 12 does not cut off iPhone 5s, advanced iOS 12 features are unlikely to be supported like with prior iOS versions. As an example, recording H.265-encoded video or shooting in iOS 11’2 new HEIF image format requires the A10 Fusion chip or better.
* iOS is apparently going to have another Snow Leopard-like moment.
* Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported a while ago that Apple’s leadership had decided to delay major iOS 12 features in order to focus on under-the-hood performance and bug fixes.
* iOS 9 similarly brought enhanced performance and other refinements.
* iOS 12, Apple’s next iteration of its mobile operating system, will be previewed at the company’s annual pilgrimage for developers this summer, about a month and half away.
