* Microsoft’s Hub Keyboard is now available for the iPhone. No, it’s not the Windows Phone keyboard that’s being ported to Apple’s handset. It’s an iOS version of the Hub Keyboard that landed on Android in February.
* Like other third-party software keyboards, Hub can be easily installed on your device once downloaded. Just navigate to Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard, and select Hub from the subsequent list.
* Isn’t it painful to switch between apps just to complete your routine on-the-go tasks? Hub Keyboard, a Microsoft Garage project, lets you stay in context by bringing information from different services to your fingertips and help complete your tasks faster. Sign in with your Office 365 work or school account to unlock access to more information.
* That Office 365 integration allows you to grab and share URLs of documents in OneDrive and SharePoint, as well as share contact info. The Hub Keyboard is English only, but Microsoft is working on other languages.
* You can download Microsoft Hub Keyboard in the App Store for free.
