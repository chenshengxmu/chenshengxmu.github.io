* Not long after it seeded iOS 9.2 beta 1 to developers, Apple has released iOS 9.2 for public beta testers on its public beta program website. iOS 9.2 is a small update, but as we told you about, it brings some significant new features to iOS 9’s new Safari View Controller for embedded web views.
* If you’re already a member of the public beta, or if you’d like to join, simply head over to Apple’s beta website to get started.
* To get started with the public beta on your iOS device, you’ll need to log in to the beta program website, and enroll your device, if not already.
* Here is the change log for iOS 9.2 beta 1. This change log is for the developer edition of the iOS 9.2 beta, but it should apply to the public beta as well:
* Also, here is our video breaking down the new changes for iOS 9.2 thus far:
* If you decide to give the public beta a test drive, then please be sure to share your thoughts on it in the comments. We’ve heard that it makes a big difference when it comes to smoothness and frame-rate on the larger Plus-sized iPhones, but we’ve yet to independently confirm that. Your comparative feedback would be much appreciated.
