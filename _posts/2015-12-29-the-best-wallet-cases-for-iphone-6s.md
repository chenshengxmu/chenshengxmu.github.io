* This case is slim and form-fitting to your iPhone 6s. The back of the soft leather cover has one single pocket that is just the right size for a bank card and ID. If you are stepping out and don’t want to fill your pants pockets with unnecessary accouterments, use this minimalist wallet case. It comes in tan, black and gray and is available on Amazon for $50. There is also a version for the iPhone 6s Plus for $60.

* Another slim-fitting case is this one from Incipio. Upon first inspection, you would think it was simply a hard-shell cover with a grip skin. However, when you look closer, you’ll find a hidden compartment underneath a hardly-noticeable door. It is just big enough to hold an ID and credit card (or maybe a couple of folded bills). For an added bonus, the door doubles as a kickstand so you can display your iPhone in landscape mode. It comes in a variety of colors and is available on Amazon for $19. There is a version available for the iPhone 6s Plus for the same price.

* Do you think of yourself as a jet-setting archeologist, always searching for fortune and glory? Then, you might be interested in this case. I imagine the Layered Dandy is exactly what Dr. Indiana Jones would use if he existed in an era when there were a such thing as smartphones. This one has a nice soft leather exterior, including a front cover with a magnetic closure clasp. Inside the front cover, you’ll find three card slots and a larger pocket for holding bills. It comes in black, brown, and red and is available on Amazon for $25. There is a version available for the iPhone 6s Plus for the same price.

* I would call this case The Executive because it looks like the perfect match for the businessman on the go. It is relatively thin, so it fits comfortably in your pocket, but has a card slot on the backside for holding multiple cards, as well as some cash. It has a unique rounded, eye-catching design and the pocket has a small cutout to make removing your cards easier. It comes in a variety of colors and is available on Amazon for between $40 and $60, depending on your color preference. There is also a version available for the iPhone 6s Plus for the same price.

* This leather bound cover is the most interesting wallet case on our list, and has the most wallet-like features. Inside the book-like cover, you’ll discover not just four card slots, but also a clear window slot for your ID. There is also a bill holder behind the card slots big enough to hold bills that only need to be folded in half. To top it all off, the entire thing looks like a vintage leather book, so you will catch some eyes when you open it up. It is available in black and brown on Amazon for $60. There is also a version for the iPhone 6s Plus for the same price.
