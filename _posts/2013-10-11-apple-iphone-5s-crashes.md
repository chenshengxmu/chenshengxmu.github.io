* Along with the iPhone 5s being a big seller, the new Apple handset has another not so welcome feature: its apps crash twice as much those on the iPhone 5c or iPhone 5.
* The likely culprit: the iPhone 5s’s 64-bit A7 processor coupled with the 64-bit iOS 7 operating software and existing 32-bit apps. Apps running on the 64-bit iPhone 5s have a two percent crash rate.
* That’s compared to just one percent for apps running on the iPhone 5c or iPhone 5, which use the previous-generation A6 chip and a 32-bit version of iOS 7…
* Why is the iPhone 5s so vulnerable to app crashes?
* The most probable reason is that developers had no time to check on the handset’s 64-bit hardware. By contrast, Apple released early test versions of iOS for 32-bit iPhones back in June, software flaw tracker Crittercism tells AllThingsD.
* The company’s CEO described the problem as “inevitable” given Apple’s move to fully 64-bit hardware and software.
* “Anytime there is new hardware or software release, we see issues,” Andrew Levy said. Levy pointed to when desktop PCs shifted to a 64-bit architecture, requiring developers to write new software.
* The good news is that Apple is certainly aware of issues. Apple is doing a really good job of addressing these issues as they come up.
* We previously detailed app crashes on the iPhone 5s, based on a growing thread on Apple’s support forums (here and here).
* There’s one possible and reasonable explanation for all this.

* Transitioning existing 32-bits apps to 64-bit code brings with it increased memory usage that, unless managed carefully, can result in the increased memory consumption that can be detrimental to an app’s performance.
* This is because iOS 7 on the iPhone 5s contains both 32-bit and 64-bit kernel, libraries and frameworks that load on demand, adding up to memory usage. When all apps running on the device are compiled for the 64-bit runtime, iOS 7 never loads the 32-bit versions of those libraries so the system uses less memory.
* Unfortunately, app developers have only begun transitioning their code to the 64-bit platform so it’ll take a while until most App Store software is provided in the fat binary form that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit devices akin to universal iPhone/iPad app binaries.
* Therefore, Apple states, “it is to everyone’s benefit that all apps running on 64-bit devices be compiled for the 64-bit runtime, especially apps that support background processing.”
* Apple’s transition guide details porting apps to the new 64-bit architecture.
* Here’s the dreaded ‘blue screen of death’ crashing an iPhone 5s.
* Among the features introduced in iOS 7 is improved multitasking and Notification Center, the all-new Control Center and more. Since launching iOS 7 in late September, the company has issued two firmware updates fixing some of the early teething problems.
* Now Apple is urging app developers to catch up by testing their apps on the 64-bit iPhone 5s. So far, most app updates have concerned themselves with only matching the cosmetic changes introduced with iOS 7.
* What’s your experience with the iPhone 5s been so far?
