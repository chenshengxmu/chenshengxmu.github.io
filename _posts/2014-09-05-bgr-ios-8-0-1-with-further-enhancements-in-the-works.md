* With four days until Apple’s big reveal and the impending public launch of iOS 8, the Cupertino firm is already preparing the first iOS 8.0.1 update, BGR reported Friday. The software contains unspecified “further improvements” and Apple is going to seed it to its carrier and testing partners shortly. Note that BGR has a pretty solid track record in predicting carrier-related news.
* Just recently, the site correctly claimed that the current iOS 8 Beta 5 would be the final beta released to developers ahead of a Gold Master. Indeed, the iPhone maker last month exclusively released iOS 8 Beta 6 to carrier partners for testing ahead of the iOS 8 launch.
* According to BGR founder Jonathan Geller, iOS 8.0.1 should contain unspecified “further enhancements to iOS 8”. I’m going to update this article with the official changelog as soon as BGR gets hold of it.
* It’s possible that Apple will release iOS 8.0.1 the same day iOS 8.0 gets released for public consumption. Last year, for example, iOS 7.0.1 went live the day the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were released to fix launch-day bugs.

* If I were a betting man, I’d say that iOS 8.0.1 is for the most part a bug-fix release.
* Some of the missing iOS 8 features that will likely make their way into an upcoming iOS 8.1: an improved Maps app with public transit directions and a car-finding feature, a standalone iTunes Radio app, native TextEdit and Preview apps and more.
