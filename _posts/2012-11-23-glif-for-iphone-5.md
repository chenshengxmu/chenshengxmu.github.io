* Sooner than later, avid iPhone photographers yearn for a tripod mount to help frame their shots perfectly. That’s why we were so excited about the Glif, an all-in-one tripod mount that launched two years ago. And now, from the minds of the original creators Dan Provost and Thomas Gerhardt – the duo behind Studio Neat – comes the Glif for your iPhone 5.
* First batch of this awesome accessory is on its way to the warehouse and will begin shipping early next week. If you’re serious about iPhoneography, this could be your must-have holiday item. If you’re interested in the Glif, I’ve included more info and a making-of video right after the break…
* The Glif features a 1/4″-­20 thread that fits any standard tripod or camera mount.
* Provost and Gerhard explain:
* Our goal was to create something small, simple, and elegant. But out of this simple design emerges countless uses. Mount your iPhone to a tripod for taking great pictures or making movies.
* Prop your iPhone up for hands-­free FaceTiming or to watch videos. All of that and more in a compact design that is manufactured in America. 
* I love the propping up ability.

* They make these from recyclable rubberized plastic, here’s the making-of clip.
* The accessory starts at $20.
* A pricier Glif+ bundle is available for an additional $10, containing the Glif itself plus an additional piece, the Serif, which keeps your iPhone secure on the tripod (for extreme situations) and the Ligature add-on which attaches to the tripod thread on the Glif.
* Shipping in the United States and internationally is $2.5 and $7, respectively.
* If you’re ready to take the plunge, head over to Studio Neat’s web store.
