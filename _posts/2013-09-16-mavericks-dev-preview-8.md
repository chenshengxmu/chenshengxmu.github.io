* Apple has seeded the 8th developer preview of OS X Mavericks this evening. The download comes nearly two weeks after developer preview 7 landed, which included a handful of improvements and new wallpapers.
* Registered developers can receive the update via the Software Update tool in the Mac App Store or can download the entire firmware through Apple’s Mac Dev Center… 
* Apple first introduced OS X Mavericks at WWDC in June. It’s expected to officially launch this October, bringing about a number of new features including Maps and iBooks apps, Safari improvements, and much more.
* While the last few Mavericks betas have been uneventful, we’re currently installing Developer Preview 8 on our machines to see if there have been any changes. And, as usual, we’ll be reporting back with anything of note.
* Update: As noted by many of our readers, today’s Developer Preview update features a new version of iTunes 11.1. But aside from a new ‘app organizer’ screen, there doesn’t appear to be any other significant changes here.
* Notice something new? Be sure to tell us about it in the comments section below!
