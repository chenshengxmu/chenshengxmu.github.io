* It seems like it’s been a while since we’ve heard any new information regarding the next-generation iPhone. The rumor mill has been chock-full of iPad Mini talk, but nothing regarding the highly-anticipated handset.
* That changed this afternoon, as purported photos of “iPhone 5 engineering samples” surfaced on the web. The metal mockups depict a device in line with previous speculation, with a slightly taller, thinner case design…

* 9to5Mac spotted the photos on GottaBeMobile, and the subjects of the images are being called “actual engineering samples manufactured in Apple’s supply chain.” Although it’s certainly possible that the samples are fake, the design does appear to match up with other next-gen iPhone reports.

* The two-toned case design has shown up on a number of occasions over the last 6 months, in everything from leaked parts to manufacturing schematics. If this year’s iPhone doesn’t look anything like this, then someone (possibly even Apple) has pulled off quite an elaborate hoax.
* Looks aside, Apple’s next-generation iPhone is expected to be one of the largest updates in the line’s history with a larger 4-inch display, LTE-compatibility and other updated components. The company is presumed to unveil the new handset at a media event in early October.
