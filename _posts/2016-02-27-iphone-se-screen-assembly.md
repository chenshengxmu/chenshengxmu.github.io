* Just as so-called ‘iPhone SE’ is about to enter mass production, we have become exposed to its very first claimed component leak. Saturday, the reliable French blog NowhereElse.fr posted a purported image of the iPhone SE’s screen assembly which supports the thesis that 3D Touch will remain exclusive to the iPhone 6s as a differentiating feature.
* 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus uses an additional layer with 96 pressure-sensing sensors and is found between the display itself and the backlight module. No such layer could be identified in the leaked image.
* Seen top of post, the claimed iPhone SE screen assembly, at left, clearly lacks a 3D Touch module like on the iPhone 6s, shown at right.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone SE will inherit Apple’s most recent hardware features found in the current-generation iPhone 6s series, such as the A9 processor with 2GB of RAM, a twelve-megapixel camera with support for Live Photos, NFC for touchless Apple Pay transactions and more.

* The device is also expected to pack in a slightly curved “2.5D” multi-touch display, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, the M9 motion co-processor which supports a tetherless ‘Hey Siri’ feature and a slightly bigger 1,642 mAh battery compared to the iPhone 5s.
* The analyst predicts that the handset will cost between $300 and $400 in the United States, prompting Apple to discount the current iPhone 5s by as much as fifty percent, potentially bringing its price down to $225.
* Apple is believed to be holding a media event in mid-March that should serve as a launchpad for both the iPhone SE and a third-generation iPad Air, described as a smaller iPad Pro with support for Apple Pencil and a smaller Smart Keyboard.
