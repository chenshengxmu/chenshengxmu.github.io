* T-Mobile announced this weekend that it would be making some changes to its existing Simple Choice plans. All of the plan options will now include more data and unlimited international texting from the US, in addition to unlimited domestic talk, text and data.
* Pricing tiers still start at $50 per month, except now you get a full 1GB of LTE data at this price, instead of just 500MB. And it goes on from there. You now get 3GB of unthrottled LTE data for $60 per month, instead of 2.5GB, and you get  5GB for $70 per month…
* From the press release:
* “Today, we’re doubling down on Simple Choice. With these announcements, we’re delivering even more high-speed data to Simple Choice customers.  Every existing Simple Choice customer will automatically get more and not a single existing customer will have to pay more – that’s Un-Carrier.  I’d love to see our competitors try that.
* Simple Choice plans still start with one line at $50 per month for unlimited data, talk and text on the T-Mobile network.  You only have to decide how much high speed 4G LTE data you want.  And now on the core plan, you’ll get a full 1GB of 4G LTE data and tethering – double the previous amounts.  Additional lines continue to be $30 for the second line and $10 for up to three additional lines for unlimited data talk and text, and now 1GB of 4G LTE data. 
* If you want more 4G LTE data on any of your lines, you can opt for getting 3 GB of 4G LTE data including tethering for an extra $10 a month per line (that’s up from 2.5 GB before). Or you can get 5 GB of 4G LTE data including tethering for an extra $20 a month per line (a new offer).  And you power users also still have the option to get totally unlimited 4G LTE data, now with 5 GB of 4G LTE tethering , double the previous amount for an extra $30 a month per line (unlimited 4G LTE plans with 2.5GB of tethering were previously an extra $20 per month).
* Note that the final tier—the one that includes unlimited 4G LTE data—is actually going up in price from an extra $20 per month to an extra $30. The good news is that customers who have the current unlimited LTE plan for an extra $20 will be grandfathered in.

* In addition to the data plan changes, T-Mobile will also be adding unlimited international texting from the United States at no extra cost to all of its Simple Choice plans. The data changes take effect on March 23 and the international texting will begin in early April.
