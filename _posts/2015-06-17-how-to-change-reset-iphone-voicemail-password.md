* When iPhone first came out in 2007, it was the first device to include Visual Voicemail, a feature that allows users to view their voicemails, scroll through them, and of course listen to them, directly from the device. With Visual Voicemail, no need to dial a number and go through an automated message system to listen to your voicemails.
* Since everything is now handled directly on the phone, you can also change your voicemail password directly from your iPhone.
* In this post, we’ll show you how to change your Visual Voicemail password from your iPhone.
* Assuming you already know your current voicemail password, you can easily change it, right from your iPhone.
* Step 1: On your iPhone, go to Settings > Phone.
* Step 2: Tap the Change Voicemail Password option.
* Step 3: Enter your current voicemail password, then tap Done in the upper right corner.
* Step 4: Enter a new voicemail password, then tap Done.
* Step 5: Re-enter your new voicemail password to confirm, and tap Done.
* Your new voicemail password should now be active. Next time you check your voicemail on your iPhone, you should be prompted to enter the new passcode.
* Unfortunately, if you ever forget your voicemail password, there is no way to reset it from your iPhone. Instead, you will either have to contact your carrier or check its website and see if they offer an option to reset the password online.
