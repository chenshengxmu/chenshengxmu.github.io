* For years, Apple’s been courting content owners to support its ambitions to provide its users a package of TV programming and live broadcasts, to no avail.
* But Apple’s living room strategy is said to have shifted recently from building an inexpensive skinny bundle of TV programming to developing a simple interface for browsing digital programming guides.
* First signs of this new direction should become visible at Thursday’s “Hello again” Mac event: USA Today claims that Apple will unveil a new app for giving owners of the fourth-generation Apple TV personalized recommendations for television shows.
* According to the people with knowledge of the project who could not be named because of the confidential nature of the negotiations, the app will provide contextual recommendations based on a user’s existing viewing habits and content subscriptions.
* Described to network executives as “the Watch List,” the app will recommend shows based on the content viewers access through their Apple TVs. For example, a subscriber to FX Networks might be encouraged to check out the new dramatic series Atlanta.
* For content owners, the app will serve as a central hub to promote new shows.
* The Apple TV’s Single Sign-On feature, which is yet to launch, will remember a user’s login information to automatically unlock all the channels they pay for.
* Distilling recommendations into a single app builds on the improvements in search and discovery that Apple introduced last year, said the article.
* “The Watch List” is just a code-name: the app will be marketed under a different name when it’s available to consumers.
* An Apple spokesperson declined comment.
