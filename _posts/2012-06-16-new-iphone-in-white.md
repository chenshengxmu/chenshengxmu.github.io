* Last week, some amazing renderings of  — what much of the tech world is assuming to be — the next generation iPhone surfaced on the net. They looked so good, in fact, that a lot of us wondered if they were the real deal.
* But alas, they weren’t. As we later found out, the images were just a gorgeous 3D art project by designer Martin Hayjek. And today, he’s back with some even better looking renderings of the new iPhone in white…

* Once again, Hayjek’s models appear to closely mirror recent reports and speculation. From leaked parts to schematics, everything we’ve heard so far regarding Apple’s next smartphone points to a similar design:
* An elongated 4-inch display, a centered FaceTime camera, a slimmer profile, and a two-toned metal backing. We also continue to hear whispers of a new, smaller charging port, and a relocated headphone jack.

* To be honest, we’re not sure what to make of this design at this point. We can’t imagine that Apple, in its efforts to double-down on secrecy, would sit idly by while the whole internet gawked at its unannounced handset.
* We’re also reminded of the purported teardrop-shaped “iPhone 5” cases that popped up everywhere last year, leading folks to believe that the 2011 model was going to feature a serious redesign. And then it didn’t.
* What we do feel comfortable assuming, however, is that the next-generation iPhone will feature a faster processor, LTE compatibility, and will be unveiled at an Apple media event sometime in the fall.
* But the jury is still out on what it’ll look like.
* What do you think?
