* With the all-important Black Friday shopping weekend just around the corner, Apple continues to improve supply of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Shipping estimates for select models of the handsets have recently ameliorated for Apple’s US online store and in other countries.
* Both 64GB and 128GB iPhone 6 models, as well as the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus, are now showing ship dates 7 to 10 days out for all colors across all major US carriers. And the 16GB iPhone 6 is now shipping in 5 to 7 days, with Personal Pickup available at a number of Apple Stores.
* As for the two larger iPhone 6 Plus models, they are still taking a while to ship. The 64GB currently shows a shipping estimate of 2-3 weeks, in all colors and carrier combinations, and the 128GB is currently showing “available to ship” estimates of 3-4 weeks in all combinations.
* If you’re looking to get one of the new iPhones as a holiday gift, you’ll definitely want to order it as soon as possible to ensure arrival by December 25th. You can also check with your local Apple Store and electronics retailers, as inventory of each model is sure to vary by location.
* Apple hasn’t announced its Black Friday offerings yet, but Walmart, Best Buy and several other retailers have. Walmart is discounting the new iPhones by $20 and including a free $75 gift card with purchase. Best Buy, Target, and we expect many others, will have similar deals.
