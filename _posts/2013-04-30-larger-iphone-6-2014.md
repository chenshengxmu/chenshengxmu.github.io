* Despite the fact that Apple added a 4-inch option to its iPhone lineup last year, many folks are still calling for the Cupertino company to produce a larger handset. Even outspoken billionaire Donald Trump says he’s in favor of a so-called ‘iPhablet.’
* During a conference call last week, Tim Cook all but shot down the idea of a larger iPhone, saying that Apple is not willing to make the tradeoffs currently necessary for bigger screens. But according to a new report, that could change next year…
* Speaking with Jefferies & Company analyst and managing director Peter Misek, the Financial Post reports:
*  “Apple Inc. will likely launch a larger screen iPhone 6 in June 2014, according to Jefferies analyst Peter Misek. While this may seem like an eternity for fans of the popular smartphone, he explains the wait is due to the time required to transition the device’s display technology.”
* That’s a pretty bold prediction, especially considering recent comments made by Apple’s chief decision-maker:
* “We always strive to create the very best display. Some customers value large screen size. Others value other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, reflectivity, power consumption, compatibility of apps, portability.
* Our competitors have made some significant tradeoffs in many of these areas to ship a larger display. We would not ship a larger display iPhone while these tradeoffs exist.”
* But as we’ve mentioned before, Cook’s ‘no larger display iPhone’ comments can be likened to those he made in 2011 regarding LTE handsets and pre-iPad mini comments on 7-inch tablets. He’s not really saying “no,” he’s just saying “not until we get it right.”
* Interestingly enough, though, Misek’s prediction lines up with previous reports from DigiTimes and other outlets that say Apple is looking to launch a plus-sized iPhone in the summer of 2014, with a Retina display measuring just north of 5-inches diagonally.
* As for this year, Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 5S, a familiar looking handset with performance improvements, an upgraded iSight camera, and fingerprint scanner. It was initially supposed to debut this summer, but recent chatter has it landing in the fall.
