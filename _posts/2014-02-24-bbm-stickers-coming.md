* The embattled Canadian smartphone maker, BlackBerry, has confirmed plans to bring popular virtual stickers to its cross-platform messaging app, BBM. The stickers will be available for purchase through a new BBM Shop section that will be made part of a forthcoming BBM app update. BBM, a free download from the App Store, has recently been updated with voice calling, BBM Channels, location sharing and other features…
* According to the BlackBerry blog, each sticker pack will offer between 20-25 stickers.
* The company will be partnering with brands to deliver sticker packs relating to a theme or a character like CosCat, Gilbert’s Tales, Bubble Bot and more.
* You’ll also find some of your favorite characters from TV and movies in sticker form (more on that later). Lastly, many of your favorite BBM emoticons will also be available in a free BBM sticker pack so you can really get your point across in a bigger, bolder way.
* The sticker packs will be available for purchase from the new BBM Shop.
* Some sticker collections will be offered free, such as the legacy BBM emoticons.
* BBM is also coming to Windows Phone and Nokia X platforms in the coming months, the team confirmed, adding they’ve been hard at work on “lots of great new features for BBM that we can’t wait to tell you about”.
* BBM is available free in the App Store.
