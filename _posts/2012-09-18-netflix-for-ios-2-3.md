* If you get your entertainment via Netflix, you will love an updated version of the company’s streaming app for iPhones, iPods and iPads that was just released for a “more immersive experience”. What that means is a crisper, less packed interface which combines your previously watched content, recommendations and latest titles into a single view, with search available throughout the program. Here’s your video…
* Netflix promises in a blog post “many more titles and galleries than we have ever shown before on a smartphone”.
* The new iPhone experience should more closely resemble the iPad version which was recently overhauled with a new interface. The top of the app’s interface is dominated by a row of your previously watched movies. Your movie and TV show recommendations take up the majority of screen real estate.
* Some other tweaks:
* Tapping the browse menu gives you access to an extensive list of genre galleries that show even more titles organized into categories. Parents – like me – will really appreciate the children and family gallery with many titles organized by age.
* Search is now available everywhere in the app and you can also tap once or do a double-tap on any title to get information or start playback, respectively.
* Here’s your video.
* Netflix is surprisingly quick to update their app for new Apple devices. Back in March, for example, the company issued a Retina update, just in time for the arrival of the third-generation iPad.
* With this latest update, Netflix is looking to benefit from the iPhone 5 lunch this Friday.
* iTunes reviews, however, don’t look promising.
* This is ONLY good for using with the iPad. It will not allow you to get into your regular queue to add movies for viewing at home. A while back, I remember you could do that. Please bring that feature back! Other than that, it’s a great app.
* Another one.
* The UI looks a little sharper in some places, but is more clunky pretty much everywhere. Whatever they did, navigating is much less smooth/pleasurable than it used to be.
* Netflix is a free download supporting your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad running iOS 5 or higher.
