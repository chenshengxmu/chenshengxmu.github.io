* Just about 2 weeks after releasing the previous version, the Dev Team released today UltraSn0w 1.2.3, a software unlock for iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS. Like its predecessor, this newer version of UltraSn0w doesn’t unlock the latest basebands.
* UltraSn0w will only work for the older iPhone 4 baseband 1.59.00, and iPhone 3G/3GS basebands 4.26.08, 5.11.07, 5.12.01, 5.13.04, and 6.15.00…
* Again, just to be very clear, if your baseband is different from any of the basebands listed above, you will not be able to use UltraSn0w to unlock your iPhone.
* As usual, UltraSn0w can be downloaded from Cydia. Make sure you reboot your iPhone after installing UltraSn0w.
