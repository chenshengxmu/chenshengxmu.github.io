* According to The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Apple is in talks with banks in the United States on a brand new person-to-person mobile payment service that would be rival to PayPal’s Venmo platform and could launch as soon as 2016.
* According to people familiar with the ongoing talks, it’s unknown at this stage whether any of the banks have cut a deal with the iPhone maker and how the rumored service would tie into the banking industry’s existing infrastructure.
* “The service under consideration would allow consumers to zap payments from their checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices,” reads the report.
* “The service would likely be linked to the company’s Apple Pay system, which allows customers to make credit-card and debit-card payments with their mobile phones,” writes author Robin Sidel.
* According to Apple CEO Tim Cook in The Independent today, Apple has no desire to enter the banking business. “Nobody wants to become a bank anymore,” he said. “And we don’t want to become a bank.”
