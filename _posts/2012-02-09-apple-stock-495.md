* It sure is a good time to be an Apple investor. After reaching new records a couple weeks ago, the stock hasn’t stopped going up ever since. AAPL is currently trading at about $495, which is an absolute record.
* As 9to5Mac notes, at its current $460 billion market capitalization, Apple is worth more than 10% of all NASDAQ combined. More impressive maybe is that Apple is worth 52 times RIM’s value, more than 5 times Amazon’s, more than twice the value of Google, and almost double the size of Microsoft. Heck, Apple is worth more than Google and Microsoft combined!
* I said it before and I’ll say it again, although the stock is expensive, it’s still a very good time to buy Apple.
