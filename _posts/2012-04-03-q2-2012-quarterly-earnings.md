* As noted by TheNextWeb, Apple has updated its Investor Relations page to notify shareholders that it will hold its Q2 2012 earnings call on Tuesday, April 24th. The call will start at 2pm PST, and include stats and sales figures from the last three months.
* Apple has a lot of momentum right now and is expected to announce another successful quarter. Its stock price is sitting at the highest it’s ever been, and its new iPad has broken a number of sales records since it launched early last month…
* But momentum or not, the company still has some fairly lofty expectations to live up to. Remember, it was just last quarter that it announced that it had sold a staggering 37 million iPhones, 15 million iPads, and generated nearly $50 billion in revenue.
* It’ll be interesting to see what Apple was able to accomplish during the most recent quarter, as far as revenue and iDevice sales, without the holiday wind in its sails. It will also give us an idea of what to expect from the company for the rest of the year.
* As usual, we’ll be covering the call and providing a roundup of all announcements.
