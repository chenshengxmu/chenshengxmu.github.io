* If you’re rocking a jailbroken iPhone and you like Mario, then a newly released jailbreak tweak is sure to be right up your alley. 1UP is a brand new tweak that alters the sound of Message notifications to that of the classic Mario coin sound found in Nintendo’s storied gaming franchise.
* The real treat of the tweak, and the inspiration behind the name, comes from when you reach a preset threshold of notifications. By default, once you receive 10 notifications for the Messages app, you’ll hear the special “1UP” sound instead of the typical coin notification.
* 1UP is a great tweak to have if your heart strings are easily pulled by video game nostalgia. Best of all, it’s available free of charge on Cydia’ ModMyi repo.
* After installation, you can begin using 1Up immediately, or you can head over to the tweak’s preferences to configure some of its options. There’s the obligatory kill switch, but there’s also a section for setting the number of notifications that must be obtained before you hear the special 1Up sound. You can easily change the default number of 10 notifications to any number of your choosing.

* 1UP’s settings also allow you to adjust the “levels” (apps) that work with tallying the notifications. The only level set by default is the Messages app, but you can enable any additional app to help increase the notification tally and reach the special 1Up notification sound at a faster pace.
* 1UP is an original jailbreak tweak that’s easy to recommend. I’ve heard some people express concerns with the tweak’s stability, but it’s been solid on my iPhone 6 Plus thus far.
* Again, you can download 1UP free of charge from Cydia’s ModMyi repo. What are your thoughts on the tweak?
