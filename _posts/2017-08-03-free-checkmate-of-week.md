* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Checkmate! For the next 7 days, you can pick up the popular iMessage chessboard for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving you $1.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* We use iMessage for everything from keeping up with family news to sending stickers to our significant others. Sometimes, though, we just want to duke it out with knights and kings on the chessboard. What makes Checkmate so great—aside from its super-intuitive interface—is the way we can chat with (and smack-talk) as we play…or take as much time as we need to contemplate our next move.
* Checkmate! is available in the App Store for free.
