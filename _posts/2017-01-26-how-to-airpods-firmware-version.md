* Most Bluetooth headphones have a firmware that can be periodically updated, and AirPods are no different. These firmware updates tend to be extremely small in size and usually offer bug fixes and stability improvements in order to fix issues users may encounter (ie. quick battery drain, etc…).
* In this post we will show you how can find out what your AirPods firmware version is.
* A firmware is a software programmed into engineered products and systems. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. Think of it as the software for the hardware. Most electronics manufactured in recent years contain a firmware. Your TV remote is the perfect example of a simple product that contains a firmware. In that case, the firmware is used to control what happens when you press a button, for instance.
* Similarly, your AirPods have a firmware installed on them that allows the device to operate. When you double tap on your AirPods to invoke Siri, the firmware is controlling that.
* While this information will be useless to the vast majority of people, nerds like us just like to know the nitty-gritty details about their electronics. Personally, as an AirPods user who has encountered small issues with the earphones in the past, I just want to keep track of the firmware version to find out if Apple has made some changes that may result in better user experience for me.
* For instance, my AirPods have trouble connecting with my Apple Watch on a regular basis. Will a future firmware update change this? I want to know.
* Although Apple doesn’t provide any details about this, the firmware of your AirPods can be automatically updated when connected to its paired iPhone. That iPhone can receive an over-the-air software update for the AirPods, and when that happens, the iPhone will eventually push that software update to the AirPods. All this is is completely invisible to the user.
* By following these instructions, you can manually install a software update for your AirPods, however you cannot prevent an update from happening.
* Unfortunately, there is currently no way to tell what’s included in a firmware update for AirPods. Maybe Apple will release this information in the future, but I find that very unlikely.
* Finding out the firmware version of your AirPods is quick and easy. On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About. Scroll down to the bottom and look for the AirPods cell. Tap on it, and you shall see information about your AirPods, including your model number, serial number, firmware version, and hardware version.
* As of this writing, the firmware version of AirPods is 3.3.1. As future iOS versions are released, I will make sure to keep track of my AirPods firmware version and see if any update was made, indicating possible stability improvements.
