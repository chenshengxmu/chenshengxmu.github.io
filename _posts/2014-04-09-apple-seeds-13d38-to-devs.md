* Apple has seeded another beta for OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The update comes one week after the fifth beta of 10.9.3 was released, which brought about few notable changes.
* The new beta build is available to registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a complete download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…
* We’ve seen a number of enhancements in 10.9.3 thus far, including the addition of a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays and the restoration of the ability to sync contacts and calendar info.
* Today’s build is labeled 13D38, and Apple continues to ask developers to focus on Graphics Drivers and Audio, and Safari. As always, we’ll be sure to let you know if it also adds any new features worth note.
