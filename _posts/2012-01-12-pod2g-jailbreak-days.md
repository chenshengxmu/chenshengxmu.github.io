* If you haven’t figured it out by now, this whole A5 jailbreak thing is kind of a big deal. The entire jailbreak community has its eyes on pod2g and the rest of the “Dream Team” as they finish up their work on the highly anticipated exploit.
* iPhone 4S users are now going on three months without a jailbreak, and iPad 2 owners who upgraded to iOS 5 last summer are going on 7. But it looks like we won’t have to wait much longer, as pod2g says the A5 jailbreak is just days away…
* The group has made some major progress over the last few days. Yesterday we reported that the hackers had finally cleared the sandbox, and resolved all major blocking issues. But we still had no idea when the jailbreak would finished.
* Then today, pod2g posted this to his blog:
* “Here are some news about the current work on the A5 research. @planetbeing escaped from the sandbox with the help of @saurik. Thanks to their awesome work, there should be nothing left blocking for the A5 jailbreak. Now it should be a matter of days. Still no precise ETA of course. We all want this to be finished ASAP, we’re getting tired!”
* Of course, 100 things could still go wrong over the next few days to prevent the release. But we’re still excited. Make sure to keep checking back with iDB, as the A5 jailbreak could drop literally any day now. Great work guys.
