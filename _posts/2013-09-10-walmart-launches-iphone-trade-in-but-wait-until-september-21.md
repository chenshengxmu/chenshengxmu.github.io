* As everyone waits to learn what iPhones Apple will announce later today, the urge to trade-in current smartphones will surge. Hoping to take advantage of that last-minute push is Walmart, adding the world’s largest retailer to the list of firms offering deals on older iPhones and other used smartphones.
* But is Walmart offering the best deal?
* There are some differences which could make offers by smaller firms more attractive, starting with kick-off time…
* Walmart on Tuesday announced it’s trade-in program isn’t available until September 21, a day after the new iPhones are due to reach store shelves. Walmart’s trade-in initiative – available in over 3600 Walmart stores and Sam’s Club locations around the country – could net you anywhere between $50 to up to $300 for an entry-level iPhone 5 in good condition.
* In addition, you could get $175 for a Samsung Galaxy SIII and $52 for a Samsung Galaxy S2. By comparison, GameStop will give $390 in in-store credit for the same phone. Gazelle will give you $320 in cash or credit, for instance.
* Of course, to get the credit customers are required to sign-up for a new two-year contract with AT&T, Sprint or Verizon at the store. Alternatively, you could also sign up for one of Walmart’s prepaid wireless plans, like Straight Talk which comes with talk, text and data for $45 a month.
* Notably, the retailer has been offering low prices for some time now on the entry-level 16GB iPhone 5 (just $98) and Samsung’s Galaxy S4 (just $138) with a two-year contract from AT&T, Verizon Wireless or Sprint.
* More electronics is available for trade-in at Walmart, including tablets, MP3 players, video games, cameras, laptops and more through the recently launched, online-only Gadgets to Gift Cards offer, seen below.

* Other trade-in programs will ‘lock-in’ a guaranteed price, avoid the usual drop in value of older iDevices once new products are introduced.
* Gazelle, for example, has a 50-day window in which a price is locked-in, allowing an iPhone owner to agree to trade in their older device now and be confident of receiving a high amount nearly two months after new iPhones are unveiled and in the store.
* As in Apple’s trade-in program, Walmart only offers its version through participating retail locations. There are some bargains to be had in trade-ins, but the buyer must beware.
