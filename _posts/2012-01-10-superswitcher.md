* Apple’s App Switcher is a bit on the anemic side when it comes to features. Proof of that comes from the wasted real estate that sits above of your App Switcher just dying to be utilized.
* Of course, leave it to the jailbreak community to actually make good use of this wasted space. That’s exactly what SuperSwitcher aims to do, and as you’ll see inside, it does it quite well…
* SuperSwitcher allows you to add up to 9 bookmarks to the top portion of your App Switcher screen, and also affords you options like restart, respring, and safe mode.
* There are also a few toggles and shortcuts to new mail, new SMS, and Google search thrown in for good measure. I was able to test all of them except the phone shortcut due to my iPhone 4 lacking a SIM card at the time.
* SuperSwitcher isn’t the prettiest jailbreak tweak in existence, but it does get the job done, and it certainly beats all of the wasted space that Apple leaves for the App Switcher.
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone running at least iOS 4.2, it can be had for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Would you use a tweak like SuperSwitcher, or do you prefer Apple’s more minimalistic approach to the App Switcher?
