* Among the new features introduced in iOS 12 are some new gestures for iPad. It wasn’t mentioned on stage (at least we don’t recall seeing it), but Apple is bringing iPhone X-esque gestures to its tablet with the latest iOS update.
* From Apple’s website:
* “iOS 12 for iPad includes updated gestures that make it easier to navigate. You can now go to the Home screen by swiping anywhere on the Dock. Get to Control Center more conveniently with a swipe from the top-right corner.”
* I’ve never really been a huge fan of having to reach up to the top right-hand corner of my iPhone X to swipe down for Control Center, but I don’t think it will be as inconvenient on the iPad—especially when in Landscape mode.
