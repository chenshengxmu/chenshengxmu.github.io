* watchOS 5 brings new customizations to the stock Maps app on your Apple Watch, including the ability to personalize your turn-by-turn wrist alerts for driving, CarPlay and walking.
* Before watchOS 5, Maps navigation alerts were either on or off—you couldn’t toggle them separately for driving directions, walking directions or for navigation through CarPlay.

* With the watchOS 5 software or newer, Apple Maps’ turn-by-turn navigation alerts on your wrist can finally be adjusted to your liking independently of one another, and here’s how…
* By default, watchOS 5 keeps the turn-by-turn alert option enabled for driving navigation, walking directions and when driving with CarPlay. If your Apple Watch is on watchOS 5 or later and your iPhone is running iOS 12 or newer, you can personalize turn alerts to your liking.
* Follow the steps below to learn how.
* 1) Open the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone with iOS 12 or later.
* 2) Tap the My Watch tab.
* 3) Adjust the switches for Driving, Driving with CarPlay and Walking located underneath the Turn Alerts heading, based on your personal preference, usage patterns and needs.

* “When this is on and you’re using turn-by-turn directions, you’ll be alerted when you need to make the next turn,” reads the feature’s description.
* In my typical scenario, I don’t use CarPlay at all and rarely navigate with Maps on my wrist while walking. Therefore, I typically keep those two switches toggled off.

* This is how I personalize my wrist turn alerts
* You may want to keep wrist alerts disabled for driving navigation if you tend to kick off your turn-by-turn direction session on your iPhone or iPad.
* Personally, I don’t mind seeing a map on my iPhone when navigating, plus hearing Siri’s warnings for incoming turns and feeling alerts for upcoming turns on my wrist, all at the same time
* Following directions on Apple Watch is easy due to subtle tap on your wrist.
* You’ll feel a vibration when you’re on the last leg, and again when you arrive.
