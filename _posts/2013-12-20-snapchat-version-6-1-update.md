* In an odd late-Friday release, Snapchat has posted a new version of its popular iOS messaging client this evening. The update, which brings the app to version 6.1, is fairly significant as it adds camera filters, message replays and other new features.
* For the new filters, you can pick between black and white, sepia and vintage, and you can also add data points like time, weather, and how fast you were going when you took the photo. And as for the new Replay feature, it lets you take a second look…
* Here are your 6.1 release notes:
* Introducing Additional Services
* – Smart Filters – Add data overlays to your Snaps! – Visual Filters – Replay – Special Text – Front-Facing Flash – Up to 7 Best Friends
* To enable additional services go to Settings > Additional Services > Manage
* As it says, you’ll have to enable these new features in the new ‘Additional Services’ tab in Settings before you can use them. But once activated, all it takes is a simple swipe to the left to bring up the data overlays or a swipe to the right to see the filters.
* For those wondering about the new Replay feature, it essentially allows you to replay a single snap one time. So for example, if a friend were to send you a particular interesting photo or video, you’d be able to view it one more time after it initially expires.
* The rest of the new features are pretty self explanatory, and in all I think this was a big update for the messaging app. If you use the service, I recommend grabbing this latest version of Snapchat. It’s available in the App Store, and of course it’s free.
