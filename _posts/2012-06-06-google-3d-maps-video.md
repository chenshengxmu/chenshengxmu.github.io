* As we noted in our liveblog, today’s Google Maps presser has brought out the much-anticipated 3D imagery that we’re being told is coming to both Android and iOS platforms via the Google Earth mobile app.
* And as Apple reportedly gears up to preview its own 3D mapping solution at WWDC next Monday, it’s time to take a closer look at what Google’s technology can do.
* Well, the search giant just posted an awesome video that shows off 3D cityscapes, complete with buildings, terrain and even landscaping, from the new 45-degree aerial imagery in Google Earth. It’s pretty awesome and I for sure am liking a lot where they’re taking maps (apparently, I’m not the only one)…
* Here’s your clip.
* Some nice stuff, no?
* And Google being Google, they actually own a fleet of planes to capture the world in 3D.
* These gorgeous 3D maps are coming to Android “in coming weeks” and to iOS “when possible”, the search Goliath said at today’s presser.
* 3D maps will initially cover “several cities” in the United States and a “very large number” of cities will be covered by the year’s end, we’ve been told.
* Specifically, Google promised to add 3D models to entire metropolitan areas to Google Earth on mobile devices “in the near future”, covering a combined population of 300 million people.
* My only gripe has to do with the fact that 3D imagery is only available via the Google Earth mobile app.
* What about desktop users?
* I’m not a coder, but WebGL would make it possible to replicate this experience in a desktop browser.
* I’m eager to hear your take on Google’s 3D thing so feel free to chime in down in the comments.
