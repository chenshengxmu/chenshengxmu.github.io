* Apple today added a handful of new locations to the 3D Flyover feature in its iOS and OS X Maps applications. The new locations include Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Boise, Idaho in the United Sates, Venice, Italy, and other cities around the globe.
* First introduced in Apple Maps when it launched in 2012, the Flyover feature allows users to take close-up, 3-dimensional looks at buildings, landmarks and various other areas of interest.
* Apple a month ago added 11 new Flyover locations including cities from Texas, Puerto Rico, Italy, Germany, France, England, Sweden, Denmark and Czech Republic. There are now more than 120 locations around the world with 3D Flyover support.
