* In some ways, Mailbox and Tempo Smart Calendar are very similar. They’re both sold as ‘new takes’ on old ideas and they both used waiting lists when they launched in the spring of this year. So it’s fitting that the two are getting friendlier.
* Tempo Smart Calendar received a significant update today, bringing the young app to version 1.08. And the new version brings about, among other things, the ability to index and search your Archived email folders in both Gmail and Mailbox…
* Here’s the full 1.08 change log:
* Accept / Decline Event Invitations from Tempo: We know you’ve been waiting, so check out the new Invite Tray in the upper left corner. See all of your pending invites in the tray and RSVP. The event is entered in your calendar accordingly and the organizer notified.
* Improved Alert and Reminder Options: Now, you can set multiple alerts for a single event. (Another popular request.)
* More Options for Recurring Events: Set events to repeat daily, weekly, every 2 weeks, every weekday, monthly and yearly. Include a specific end date or keep forever. Every recurring event in your calendar has a visual indicator.
* Archived Folders and Mailbox Support!  Gmail users: Now the related emails that Tempo finds can include your Archived email folder, in addition to your Inbox and Sent folders. Go to Tempo Setting to turn this on.
* Mailbox users: With Archived email folders indexed, you’re in luck. Zero inbox + related emails = heaven.
* Time-traveler? Set the time zone for meetings and events happening in other zones.
* Design Improvements:  · Calendar Views & Settings are accessible from the new icon in the upper left corner.  · Week & Day Views are updated for an easy at-a-glance view of your schedule. · Meetings in the past are grayed-out. · Flight Card has a new look and includes city and airport names. We also handle flights with several legs better.  · Birthday Card also has a new look and you can wish Happy Birthday from Agenda, List or Month View.
* For those who haven’t played with Tempo yet, the app is far more than just a calendar. With it, you can quickly phone, email or text your contacts, look up flight statuses and find emails based on context—a feature that gets a lot better today.
* Tempo can now search through your Archived folders, in addition to Inbox and Sent folders, in Gmail and Mailbox. So for example, if you enter a meeting into the calendar and can’t remember the place, if it’s in an email, Tempo will find it.
* The bottom line is, Tempo is a solid calendar/assistant app that just got a lot better. If you’re in the market for something like this, you’ll definitely want to check it out along with some of the other greats like Donna and the new Any.do Cal app.
* You can find the latest version of Tempo Smart Calendar in the App Store, for the iPhone, for free.
