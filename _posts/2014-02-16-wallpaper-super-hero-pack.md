* Wallpapers are the way we customize our iOS devices. Unless you are a jailbreaker, changing wallpapers is one of the only ways to separate your gadget from the millions of other iPads and iPhones across the world. In an effort to help users personalize their experience, the Wallpapers of the Week section curates some of the best wallpapers each week.
* Of course, we listen to our readers. A couple weeks ago, I posted the newest Apple advertising wallpaper, designed to help push iPads for Valentine’s Day. In an overwhelming response, no one had a positive comment to leave at the article’s end. Furthering the effort to man-up the section, several hyper masculine super hero wallpapers are included…
* Celebrating the super hero universe, below are a few selected wallpapers. Obviously, there are many additional super heroes out there, but let’s see how well these images are accepted before plunging headlong into even more wallpapers. Each wallpaper is parallax ready.

* To load each image, tap the corresponding link below the picture. Once the full resolution is loaded, tap hold, then save to Camera Roll. From either Photos.app or Settings.app, select the new image and set as wallpaper. From a desktop, simply save the image to the iTunes sync folder.
* Of course, I am always interested in seeing what you collected during your wallpaper quests. Make sure to catch up with me on Twitter @jim_gresham or embed images in an email to jim@idownloadblog.com. Make sure any submissions are already in an iPhone or iPad resolution. Simply shooting over a picture that was taken with your iPhone will not be considered.
