* As most of you know, there are currently two Steve Jobs-based movies in the works. One is an indie film that has been in production for several months now and stars Ashton Kutcher. And the other, a Sony project, is being penned by Aaron Sorkin.
* Well as it turns out, the former, entitled jOBS, is almost finished. And the Sundance group just announced that they would be debuting the flick during their legendary Sundance Film Festival this upcoming January. More details after the fold…
* The 2013 Sundance Film Festival will take place in Park City, Utah and run from January 17th through the 27th. And according to the Film Festival’s press release, the Kutcher movie will be premiering on the final night of the festival; so the 27th.
* “jOBS / U.S.A. (Director: Joshua Michael Stern, Screenwriter: Matt Whiteley) — The true story of one of the greatest entrepreneurs in American history, jOBSchronicles the defining 30 years of Steve Jobs’ life. jOBS is a candid, inspiring and personal portrait of the one who saw things differently. Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Dermot Mulroney, Josh Gad, Lukas Haas, J.K. Simmons, Matthew Modine. CLOSING NIGHT FILM.”
* When it was first announced back in April that Ashton Kutcher, of That 70’s Show fame, would be playing the iconic CEO, needless to say there was a lot of skepticism. And while I’m sure much of that still remains, you have to admit, the man looks the part.
* Outside of the Sundance debut, there’s no word on when the movie will make it to movie theaters. And as far as the other Jobs film, Sorkin recently offered up some details on his approach to the script, but it seems Sony is still a ways off from filming.
* What do you think of Kutcher’s Jobs-like appearance? Are you looking forward to the movie?
