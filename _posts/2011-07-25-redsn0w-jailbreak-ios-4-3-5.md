* Following the release of iOS 4.3.5 this morning, we issued our usual warning about staying away from the latest firmware so that you don’t lose your jailbreak or unlock.
* This warning is still in effect for those who don’t want a tethered jailbreak. For the rest of you who don’t mind plugging your iDevice in your computer every time you have to reboot, the word on the street is that RedSn0w can jailbreak iOS 4.3.5…
* This will work for all devices that support iOS 4.3.5, except for the iPad 2.
* In order to jailbreak iOS 4.3.5 using RedSn0w, you will have to update to 4.3.5 first, then point RedSn0w to 4.3.4.
* Not sure how to do that? Then check our our ultimate RedSn0w guide. Make sure you are on 4.3.5, then in step 6 of the tutorial point RedSn0w to 4.3.4. The remaining steps are identical.
* Keep in mind this is a tethered jailbreak. You will need to plug your iDevice in your computer, and launch RedSn0w every single time you’ll want to reboot your iPhone, iPad, or iPod.
* Now for those of you who try this, please make sure to leave a comment below and tell us about your experience.
