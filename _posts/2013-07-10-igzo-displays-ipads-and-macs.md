* According to a new report, upcoming iPads and MacBook laptops should feature significantly better battery life thanks to their use of IGZO display panels. The technology, which uses indium gallium zinc oxide, was co-developed by Sharp and Semiconductor Energy Laboratories.
* Apple has long been rumored to adopt the use of IGZO display panels in its mobile products, but production issues and other barriers have prevented this from happening. But if today’s news holds true, that could change as early as this year thanks to supply chain advancements…
* PatentlyApple points to a report from Korea’s IT News:
* “According to a new report today from Korea’s IT News, Apple will expand the adoption of IGZO displays in order to lessen mobile devices’ energy consumption. Apple is now reportedly in serious talks with Sharp and LG.
* The sources are stating that Sharp is sinking its teeth into raising the production of IGZO panels while LG Display is upgrading its AM OLED and LCD production lines to ones capable of rolling out IGZO panels.”
* As we’ve discussed before, IGZO displays offer a few advantages over conventional panels. The thin-film transistors used in the screens let more light in, meaning the number of LEDs can be reduced, and they have a high pixel density—both of which can help increase battery life.
* IGZO display or not, Apple is widely expected to introduce a new 9.7-inch iPad this fall. It’s said to feature an all new design, with an outer shell that resembles that of the iPad mini, ie: thinner bezels and rounded edges. And there’s also been talk of a Retina mini in the works.
