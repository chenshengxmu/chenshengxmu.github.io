* This is pretty interesting. Verizon has just reached a settlement with the FCC in their ongoing dispute regarding tethering apps. The carrier will pay out $1.25 million to the US Treasury, and will stop blocking the use of third-party tethering apps.
* Unfortunately, the decision only applies to Verizon customers for the time being, as it comes as a stipulation in the carrier’s deal to purchase 700 MHz of wireless spectrum from Cox and other cable companies. FCC press release is after the break…
* Via GigaOM
* “Under the terms of today’s settlement, Verizon Wireless will make a voluntary payment to the Treasury in the amount of $1.25 million, and has committed to notifying the application store operator that it no longer objects to the availability of the tethering applications to C-Block network customers in the operator’s online market. Verizon Wireless has also agreed to implement a compliance plan, requiring that:
* 1. employees will receive training on compliance with the C Block rules.
* 2. future communications with application store operators regarding the availability of applications to Verizon Wireless customers will be reviewed in advance by legal counsel.
* 3. Verizon will report any instances of noncompliance with the rule at issue that might occur during the two-year term of the plan.
* In addition, the company recently revised its service offerings such that consumers on usage-based pricing plans may tether, using any application, without paying an additional fee.”
* This is great news for Verizon customers, who will not only be free to use their tethering apps of choice, but will also no longer be forced to pay the $20 tethering fee (unless they’re still on an unlimited plan).
* This is also good news for other wireless customers, as it can’t be long before other US carriers are forced to follow suit.
