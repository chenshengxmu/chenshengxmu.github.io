* Back in June, Apple introduced watchOS 5 for Apple Watch. One of the update’s most prominent new features is a more advanced Siri watch face. In this article, you’ll learn how to add and remove sources on this watch face. To do so, you must have watchOS 5 and iOS 12 installed on your Apple Watch and iPhone, respectively. 
* The Siri watch face launched with watchOS 4 in 2017 and provides an often-changing list of alerts based on the time of day, location, and daily routines. With watchOS 5, Apple has refined the face’s machine learning process, thereby making Siri even smarter. Perhaps better still, there’s more third-party integration build into the face. Previously, the tool was primarily limited to native apps.
* Previously, we told you how to set up the Siri watch face in watchOS 5. Once you do so, follow these steps to customize the face:
* 1) Click on My Watch on the lower toolbar in the Apple Watch app on iPhone.
* 2) Under My Faces, find the Siri watch face you just created. Click on it.
* 3) Besides Colors and Complications, on this page, you’ll see the sections, Data Sources, Favorite Teams, and 3rd Party Apps.
* 4) Under Data Sources, you’ll find only native Apple apps. Toggle on/off your choices.
* 5) Your Favorite Teams are initially set up in the TV app. Toggle on/off.

* 6) The 3rd Party Apps section only includes apps that support Siri Shortcuts. Toggle the ones you want on/off.
* Introduced in watchOS 5, Siri Shortcuts is a new tool built upon Apple’s Workflow app. With Siri Shortcuts, any app can expose quick actions to Siri.
* Here are a few examples of how adding third-party apps to the Siri watch face could prove beneficial:
* Still only available in beta, the more powerful Siri watch face should prove more useful than the version it’s replacing. Apple plans on releasing watchOS 5 this fall alongside new versions of iOS, macOS, and tvOS.
