* The iPhone Dev Team has released a command line interface tool (CLI) as an alternative for the Absinthe 2.0 untethered iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak. The CLI tool is capable of performing the exact same jailbreak that can be accomplished with Absinthe 2.0, but the difference is that it’s completely command line based.
* The CLI tool is for more advanced users who prefer to have more control over the jailbreak process. We recommend that you stick with the Absinthe 2.0 GUI tool, but it’s nice to know that a CLI tool exists if you happen to be a more advanced user.
* If you can remember, the Dev Team provided a CLI tool as an alternative to the previous version of Absinthe for the iOS 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak as well. It’s safe to assume that you can expect a similar experience to that of the previous CLI release.
* The CLI tool can be downloaded directly from our downloads page, and it works for both Mac and Windows machines. For the record, MuscleNerd states that the CLI tool is best used with a fresh iOS 5.1.1 installation.
* We will follow up later on with a tutorial that shows how to wield the CLI tool as an Absinthe 2.0 alternative.
* Will you try to use the CLI tool, or will you stick to the GUI interface that Absinthe 2.0 provides?
