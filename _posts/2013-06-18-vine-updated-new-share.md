* I haven’t quite figured out what to do with Vine yet, Twitter’s video social network, but others don’t seem to be having that problem. The app is consistently listed among the top 5 iPhone apps in the App Store, and I see shared Vine videos on Facebook daily.
* And if you happen to be a Vine user, you’ll be happy to hear that the app received a nice little update today. The new version, marked as version 1.1.3, includes a new share button to make reposting videos to other networks easier, and other UI improvements…
* From the App Store description:
* Vine is the best way to see and share life in motion. Create short, beautiful, looping videos in a simple and fun way for your friends and family to see.
* • Unlimited uploads and free • Instantly post videos on Vine, then share to Twitter and Facebook (more coming soon!) • Find, follow, and interact with people close to you • Explore trending posts, featured hashtags and editor’s picks • And so much more
* And from the version 1.1.3 change log:
* This update adds a new share button underneath posts on your feed, along with other interface improvements and bug fixes.
* My lack of Vine usage has never had anything to do with the app’s design. In fact, I think it’s both good-looking and easy to use—similar to Instagram. And it builds on that today with the new share button and other UI improvements included in the 1.1.3 update.
* Speaking of Instagram, there’s a rumor going around that Facebook’s popular photo sharing platform is about to get into the video sharing business. But until that happens, your best bet is Twitter’s Vine application, which you can find in the App Store for free.
