* As part of Instagram version 10.16 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, several new features for stickers are now available to users within the photo-sharing app.
* For example, you can now turn your selfie into a sticker and pin it to a specific spot in your video, access your recently-used stickers with a simple swipe, use geostickers in four new cities, enable a countdown timer when capturing a video and more.
* According to the firm, Instagram’s Stories has more daily active users than Snapchat as over 200 million people are now using Instagram Stories on a daily basis.
* You can now adorn your Story with stickers based on your selfies.
* Tap a smiley face when taking a photo or video to show a new sticker with a camera icon. Tap it to capture a mini-selfie, then apply the fade or circle frame style, adjust the size of the sticker or use other creative tools to enhance your selfie sticker.

* To pin one or more selfie stickers to specific spots in your video, just do what you would normally do: tap and hold a sticker, then move it over any object and let go. Lastly, confirm that you wish to pin the sticker to a video by tapping Pin. According to Instagram, pinning works with both text and any sticker type, including selfie stickers.

* Last month, Instagram enabled geostickers for users in Jakarta and New York City.
* Over the coming days, travelers and people who live in Chicago, London, Madrid or Tokyo will start seeing geostickers for their city. Geostickers have been created by local users and display the artist’s username when tapped.
