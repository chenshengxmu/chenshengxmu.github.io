* Well, it’s Friday afternoon and the folks at FireCore have just given jailbroken second generation Apple TV owners something else to be excited about as the weekend approaches: an update for the popular software suite: aTV Flash (black).
* The update, which brings the app to version 2.1, features several improvements including a new TV show playlist option, which makes it easier to pick up where you left off with your favorite show, customizable favorites, and more…
* Here’s the full aTV Flash (black) 2.1 change log from FireCore’s blog:
* The new Favorites feature is particularly cool, as it allows you to access your favorite content on your Apple TV very quickly. For example, if you want a quick link to season 4 of The Office, you can get there in just a single step with Favorites.
* As you know, aTV Flash (black) is only available for the second-generation Apple TV, as there’s no jailbreak for the ATV3 yet. And although it claims that it’s compatible with iOS 6, there’s not an untethered jailbreak available for that either.
* At any rate, if you own aTV Flash (black), you can download 2.1 for free by opening the app on your Apple TV and going to Maintenance > Manage Extras. Otherwise, you can purchase it from FireCore’s website for $29.95.
