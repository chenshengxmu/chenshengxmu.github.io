* Apple on Monday announced a new repair program to address issues where “a very small number” of iPhone 6s devices manufactured between September and October 2015 may unexpectedly shut down. The issue is apparently caused by a faulty battery, which Apple will replace free of charge if your iPhone 6s is affected. The program covers affected iPhone 6s batteries for three years after the first retail sale of the unit and may restrict or limit repair to the original country of purchase.
* “Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down,” reads the support document. Wireless carrier partners are not participating in this global program.
* You will need to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to have your device’s serial number checked before your free battery replacement is authorized. Your phone will be examined prior to the service to verify that it’s not damaged and the screen is not shattered.
* If the screen is cracked or other damage impairs the replacement of the battery, “that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement,” the firm notes. If you already paid to replace your battery, you can contact Apple about a refund.
* To prepare your iPhone 6s for service, first back up your data to iTunes or iCloud, then turn off Find my iPhone in Settings → iCloud and erase data and settings in Settings → General → Reset → Erase all Content and Settings.
* “Please call your service provider to confirm that battery replacement service is available on the day you visit them,” notes Apple.
* Just last week, Apple issued a worldwide replacement program for the iPhone 6 Plus units affected by the “Touch Disease” issue which causes the display to flicker and lose touch sensitivity.
