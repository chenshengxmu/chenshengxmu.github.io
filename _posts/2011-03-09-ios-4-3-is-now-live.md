* As we reported yesterday, iOS 4.3 became available for download today at 10 A.M. PST.iOS 4.3 is available for iPad, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iTouch 4G and 3G. Oh and I almost forgot, iOS 4.3 is for GSM iPhone only. That means that if you have a Verizon iPhone, then no iOS 4.3 for you!
* As a reminder, jailbroken iPhone users, please stay away from the new firmware until the official 4.3 jailbreak has been announced. The new software could potentially disable some of your jailbroken applications.
* With several jailbreak methods already working on beta versions of iOS 4.3, an official jailbreak can’t be too far off. That being said, the long awaited iPhone 4 unlock shouldn’t be too far off. As always stay tuned to iDB for the latest in jailbreaking information…
* Let us know if you find anything exciting hiding in 4.3.
