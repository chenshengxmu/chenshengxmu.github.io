* They say the simple things in life are some of the best things in life. They also say the best things in life are free.
* IconRotator is both.
* It’s been a while since we’ve seen a simple tweak that was this cool, but then again it was created by developer extraordinaire Ryan Petrich — I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised…
* IconRotator rotates your app icons depending on your device’s orientation, so that they always face upright. It doesn’t change your swipe orientation, just the way the app icons are oriented in relation to the way you hold your iPhone.
* You won’t find this tweak on Cydia’s default repos, but you will find it for free on Petrich’s beta repo located here: http://rpetri.ch/repo/
* Let me know what you think about IconRotator in the comments section. Do you think it’s as cool as we make it out to be?
