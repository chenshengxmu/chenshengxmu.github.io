* Apple’s iPhone event ended more than 2 hours ago, but we’re still trying to sift through the gobs of information regarding the new handset and its features. And we figured you were too.
* So we went ahead and did all of the leg work for you, and uncovered just about everything there is to know about the new iPhone hardware. And we’ve put it in a single, easy-to-read list.
* Here’s the iPhone 5 by the numbers…
* Though it looks a bit like its predecessor, the iPhone 5 is a whole different handset. Here are its measurements:
* The iPhone 5 supports GSM, CDMA, LTE and a wide range of other wireless technologies. And here they are:
* One of the first things you’ll notice on the iPhone 5 is its larger display.
* The iPhone 5’s iSight still uses an 8MP sensor, but the system has been upgraded, as has the FaceTime camera:
* Despite the fact that it has a larger display and LTE, Apple says the iPhone 5 still has great battery life:
* As usual, the iPhone 5 comes in both black and white, as well as three different storage options. And the price points are the same as well (remember, these prices are subsidized and require at least a two-year carrier contract):
* If you’re wondering how the iPhone 5 compares to the previous models, we’ve got a post for that too. The new handset will be available for preorder on September 14, and will start shipping on the 21st.
