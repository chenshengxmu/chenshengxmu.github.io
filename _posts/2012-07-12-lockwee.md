* The Lock screen has been the subject of many jailbreak tweaks over the years, and it continues to be just as popular as it was in the beginning.
* Case in point — LockWee — a tweak that allows you to swipe aside your Lock screen clock to reveal various Notification Center widgets of your choosing. Full details on video ahead…
* LockWee contains quite a few options that are accessible via the Settings app. There you’ll find options to enable or disable borders or shadows, options to prevent your Lock screen from dimming, and another settings that lends the ability to lock a particular widget into place.
* The widgets themselves feature easy to use toggles near the bottom of the LockWee settings; you can enable more than one widget at a time, and swipe the clock area consecutively to access each adjacently placed widget.
* The nice thing about LockWee is that it is a totally unassuming tweak. In fact, no one can tell you even have it installed unless you blatantly swipe your Lock screen clock to reveal the extra widgets.
* For $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, you too can have Lock screen widgets on your Lock screen. One thing you may want to keep in mind, however, is that it doesn’t play nice with IntelliScreen X.
* All things considered, do you think LockWee is worth its asking price?
