* Despite the Apple event that took place this week, the jailbreak community didn’t stop releasing tweaks in Cydia to improve upon the bland, stock installation of iOS.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released since last weekend, starting with our favorites.

* I couldn’t produce this roundup without talking about Auki 2. This tweak is a completely re-thought quick reply and quick compose jailbreak tweak for iOS 9.
* Although iOS 9 already has quick reply built into it, the improvements to the interface, as well as the addition of quick compose, make the tweak well worth it.
* Created by veteran graphic designer Surenix, and coded by veteran jailbreak developer pimskeks, you know you’re getting a quality jailbreak tweak when you download Auki 2.
* Check out our full review to learn more about how Auki 2 works.

* Glances is an amazing new Apple Watch-inspired Glance interface for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
* The tweak provides a customizable interface that replaces Control Center’s swipe-up gesture with a much more useful panel with more features and information.
* Among the things you can do with it are monitor battery performance, keep track of calendar events, manage your currently playing media, access app shortcuts, visit Control Panel, and even see what the weather is like outside.
* To learn more about Glances and what you can do with it, I highly recommend checking out our full review.
