* Microsoft today issued updates to its mobile Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps on the App Store, adding support for drawing with your finger on the iPhone. Back in January 2016, the Windows maker brought its inking tools to the iPad Pro with Apple Pencil support. With the latest update, iPhone owners can take advantage of the Draw tab to draw, highlight and annotate documents with their finger or a stylus.
* In addition to using your finger to write, draw and highlight on the iPhone with the tools in the new Draw tab, all three productivity apps provide more flexibility for storing and accessing documents with Citrix support.
* PowerPoint gained a Find icon on the ribbon for searching for text in your presentation.
* Grab Word, Excel and PowerPoint for free from the App Store.
* An Office 365 subscription is required to create and edit documents.
