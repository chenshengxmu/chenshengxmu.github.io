* In addition to several other releases, Apple on Monday pushed out the third developer beta of OS X 10.11.4. The update is available either via the Updates tab of the Mac App Store for current 10.11.4 testers, or on Apple’s developer website as a standalone download.
* Today’s beta 3 comes two weeks after beta 2 and nearly a month after the original version of 10.11.4 was released. The update is mostly under-the-hood improvements, but it does include a few new features such as support for Live Photos and password-protected Notes.
* We’re installing the update now, and will be sure to report back if we spot any other significant changes or new features. If you’re not a developer, but still want to get in on the action, remember that Apple has a public testing program for OS X that is free for all to join.
* The consensus is that OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 will be released to the public sometime in early March, alongside iOS 9.3.
