* CCDataMore is a great release because it brings a cellular data toggle right to Control Center.
* Moreover, it integrates with 3D Touch, so you can firmly press on the toggle button to individually turn off specific cellular radios in your device individually, such as LTE, 3G, and 2G.
* The toggle button itself looks and feels like a factory toggle button and lights up when enabled and dims out when disabled.
* You can read our full review of CCDataMore to learn more about why it’s a good addition to your jailbroken iPhone or iPad.
* WifiChannelBar – FREE

* WifiChannelBar is a simple tweak that displays the channel of your currently-connected wireless network in the Status Bar.
* While it has limited uses, I’ve always been an outspoken supporter of tweaks that display more information than Apple typically lets you see. Importantly, the way it displays the information is subtle, so it doesn’t feel like it adds too much clutter.
* To learn more about how WifiChannelBar can be used effectively, we recommend reading our full review.
* betterNC10: More visual options and effects for Notification Center in iOS 10 (free – review)
* Haskfm: Improvements for the Askfm app from the App Store (free)
