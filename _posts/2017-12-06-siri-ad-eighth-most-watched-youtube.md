* Apple’s ad titled “The Rock x Siri Dominate the Day” and featuring actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson is not just one of its best commercials to date, but also the eighth most-watched ad on YouTube this year.
* According to Adweek today, that ad pulled in more than 25 million times via Apple’s YouTube channel in India. This does not take into account views the ad received from Apple’s own website or its YouTube channels in the United States and elsewhere.
* It’s unclear why the publication focused on Apple’s Indian account on YouTube, but if you combine the views from all of Apple’s YouTube accounts, you’ll find that the Siri ad has amassed more than 80 million views to date.
* AdWeek notes that videos must be marked as ads on YouTube and also earn “significant organic views” in order to be eligible for the leaderboard. The algorithm factors in paid views, organic views and audience retention, which defines how much of a video people watched.

* The view count on the Siri ad is impressive, but not entirely unexpected given the spot’s funny creative concept and the fact that Dwayne Johnson powered his way to the top of the list of the highest paid actors last year.
* As for the most-viewed spot on AdWeek’s list, it’s a Samsung ad with more than 150 million views to date. Embedded right below, the nicely done commercial promotes Samsung’s customer service vans in India.
* That ad was followed by ads for Clash Royale: The Last Second (111 million views), Ping Pong Trick Shots 3 (91 million views), Miss Dior (43 million views), Budweiser (29 million views), 2018 Kia Niro (26 million views), Adidas (25 million views), Levi’s (22 million views) and more.
