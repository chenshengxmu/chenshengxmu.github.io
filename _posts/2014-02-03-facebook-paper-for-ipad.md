* Facebook’s new Paper for iPhone app has just landed in the App Store, download it free. The news-reading application, which employs beautiful edge-to-edge design and Flipboard-like gestures, serves both stories surfaced from your News Feed and cherry-picked items from big name publications curated by Facebook editors. The app can be customized with a choice of more than a dozen topics ranging photography and sports to food, science and design, with each section including “a rich mix of content from emerging voices and well-known publications”…
* The first product from Facebook Creative Labs, Paper looks unlike anything Facebook created before. The full screen design looks pleasing to the eyes and some of the gestures are reminiscent of Flipboard.
* For example, to quickly swipe through articles left and right, you just pull down on an article to flip it open.

* From iTunes release notes:
* I’m not a huge fan of the app icon, by the way.
