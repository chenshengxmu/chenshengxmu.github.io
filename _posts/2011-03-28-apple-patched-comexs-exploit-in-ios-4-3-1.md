* The cat and mouse game between Apple and jailbreakers is getting intense. Apple got real serious when they added ASLR to iOS 4.3 and forced iDevice hackers back to their drawing boards. But members of the jailbreak community responded, and a tethered jailbreak was quickly made available with a patched mobile substrate file.
* The latest move from Apple seems to be a big one. Comex tweeted about an hour ago that his kernel exploit was fixed in Apple’s latest version of the firmware, iOS 4.3.1. It was public knowledge that i0n1c and other jailbreakers were specifically waiting for iOS 4.3.1 to be released to prevent something like this from happening…
* Comex went on to say that he’s trying not to be paranoid, but couldn’t think of any explanation for the patch other than a leak. The exploit was available from 4.0.2 through 4.3, but was “magically” patched in the latest update.
* Negativity aside, he does have some good news for jailbreak hopefuls. He mentions some details about his “new” kernel exploit. He claims it is actually the same kernel exploit that was used in JailbreakMe 2.0.
* He also gives encouragement to i0n1c and MuscleNerd, hinting that the 4.3.1 release didn’t affect their jailbreak method. As always stay tuned to iDB for the latest in jailbreaking news.
* Do you think we’ll see a JailbreakMe 3.0 or another untethered jailbreak option soon? Tell us your thoughts below!
