* Hot on the heals of this morning’s news that the iPhone 5 would be landing on Strata Networks soon, comes word that the popular handset can also now be used with Solavei, a US-based prepaid provider.
* The carrier sent out a press release this afternoon announcing that it has begun offering nano Sim cards, meaning  you can now hook up Apple’s latest handset to its $49/month unlimited everything plan…
* Here’s some info from the press release (courtesy of Engadget):
* “Solavei®, an affordable contract-free mobile service provider, today announces the availability of nano SIM cards, compatible with the iPhone 5, and widening the company’s phone compatibility to include all major smartphones.”
* So essentially, like Straight Talk and other services, anyone with an unlocked GSM iPhone 5 can purchase a Solavei nano SIM Card for $9, and sign up for their $49 monthly unlimited voice, text and data plan.
* Admittedly, I had never heard of Solavei before today, so I did a little digging. And apparently it’s a brand new service—launched in September of last year—and it piggybacks on T-Mobile’s nationwide network.
* Because of this, the carrier can’t promise 3G data speeds. As you know, T-Mobile has been working on upgrading its network to iPhone-friendly HSPA+. But there are still several areas where it’s not available.
* It’s also worth noting that Solavei runs some sort of side social commerce business, where referrals earn you cash back per month. They say there’s ‘no obligation to refer,’ but I imagine you’ll hear a lot about it.
* If you can deal with these caveats though, it looks like Solavei is a decent carrier option for you and your unlocked iPhone. And bonus, it says it will work with T-Mobile’s LTE network when it launches later this year.
