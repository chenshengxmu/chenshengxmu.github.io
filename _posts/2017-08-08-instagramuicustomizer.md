* If you want to colorize your Instagram app’s UI to something other than the bland white it comes with out of the box, then we’d recommend trying a new free jailbreak tweak called InstagramUICustomizer by iOS developer Wylliam Altman.
* Once installed, you can change the default navigation bar color of your Instagram app to anything you’d like and choose whether the tab bar at the bottom of the app will be light or dark.
* To configure the tweak after installation, just visit the Settings app and open the IsntagramUICustomizer preference pane:

* Here, you can:
* Because the color is selected by way of a color picker, you don’t have to choose from a list of preset colors. This gives you an infinite number of possible color choices to pick from.
* We did notice that a respring is necessary to correctly save your changes, but since a respring button isn’t included in the preference pane for your convenience, you’ll want to use another tweak like PowerDown to respring manually once you’ve designated a new color.
* You may also want to force-quit the Instagram app before using it after customization, just to help save your changes more efficiently.
* InstagramUICustomizer is an aesthetic-driven tweak so not everyone will see the use in installing it. Nevertheless, if you like customizing your device’s color scheme, it will be a great addition to your device if you use Instagram on a regular basis.
* You can download InstagramUICustomizer for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with all jailbroken iOS 10 devices and supports the latest version of Instagram as of this writing (10.33). If you’re not already using Instagram, it’s a free download from the App Store.
* Please note that updates to the Instagram app may break the tweak in the future, requiring the developer to upgrade the tweak for compatibility.
