* Apple has been slowly porting its popular suite of iLife applications from the Mac to iOS over the last 12 months. There’s iMovie for iOS, and GarageBand. And now the company has just introduced iPhoto for iPad.
* Just like its Mac OS counterpart, iPhoto for iPad is a photo management app that will “give you great new ways to browse through all of your photos, and has truly groundbreaking ​ways to edit those photos.”
* The iPad version of the software brings tons of new features with it including “Smart Browsing,” and multi-touch photo editing. And the coolest part is that you can now beam your photos wirelessly from a device to the iPad — no computer or other software needed.
* The app will work with up to 19MP photos and employs a stable of editing features ranging from simple touch up (red-eye reduction etc.) to professional effects, and uploading images from iPhoto to Twitter, Flickr, etc. can be done in a single touch.
* iPhoto will work with the iPhone as well, and is available today for $4.99. We’ll post an App Store link as soon as it becomes available.
