* The Dev Team has released RedSn0w beta 9 for Mac and Windows. The jailbreak tool has been updated to offer full support for users that are stuck on iOS 5.0.1.
* Like all previous releases for iOS 5, this jailbreak is a tethered one. The Chronic Dev Team’s pod2g is actively working on an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.
* More information on the latest RedSn0w release:
* The holiday season is almost here (Happy Holidays!) so we realize everyone is busy (especially @pod2g!).  And even though we always recommend that jailbreakers stay where they are until a new untethered JB comes out, that’s not always possible.  So we’ve updated redsn0w for those who may have found themselves at iOS 5.0.1, and added some other useful features too:
* This is still a tethered jailbreak for all except old-bootrom 3GS users.
* As usual, you can download the latest version of RedSn0w from our Downloads page. We have a dedicated RedSn0w page with everything you need to know about the popular jailbreak tool.
