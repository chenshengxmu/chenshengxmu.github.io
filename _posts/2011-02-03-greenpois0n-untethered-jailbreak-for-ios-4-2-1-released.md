* After weeks of talks, wait, and rumors, the Chronic Dev Team finally came through with the release of their GreenPois0n untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1.
* Up until now, there was no other solution but use a beta version of RedSn0w, which let’s be honest, wasn’t very stable. I don’t know if this release will be better than RedSn0w as there isn’t much information about this version of GreenPois0n so far.
* All we know is that it works with the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and iPhone running iOS 4.2.1. Even better, unlike RedSn0w, you won’t need to have your 42b3 SHSH blobs saved in order for GreenPois0n to work. One thing is for sure, this version of GreenPois0n will not hacktivate your iPhone. So far, only a Mac version is available.
* You can download GreenPois0n from our iPhone downloads section.
* A tutorial should be up soon. If you give it a try, let us know what you think by leaving a comment below.
