* A tiny icon previously discovered in iOS 12 beta 5 has corroborated rumors that have been calling for a nearly bezel-free iPad with no Home button, and now a new discovery suggests this year’s iPad Pro will almost certainly sport the same rounded corners as iPhone X.
* Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo has managed to unearth what appears to be a previously unknown asset from Apple’s latest iOS 12 beta. The discovery may or may not confirm the thesis of an iPhone X-like iPad Pro refresh this year.
* Basically a bitmap mask that iOS uses to round the corners of some user interface elements, this new asset also mentions J3xx, which indicates a 2018 iPad model number.
* “There’s also another similar asset for this year’s entry level iPhone (codenamed N84), which seems to confirm the rumors that all of this year’s iPhones will have a design similar to iPhone X,” Guilherme added.
* The asset, seen top of post, shows how the multitasking Split View interface handles a rounded iPad display. The same asset appears when running a modified device in the iOS Simulator.
* The question is, why would iOS 12 handle rounded iPad corners if no current model has a display featuring squircles in corners—unless such a device is in fact looming on the horizon?
* Another clue: a much wider Home indicator at the bottom.
* The Cupertino technology giant will soon show its cards. In case you missed it, Apple’s Fall event could happen as soon as September 12.
* Thoughts on this leak?
