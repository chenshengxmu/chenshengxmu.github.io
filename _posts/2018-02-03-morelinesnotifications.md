* Whenever you receive long text messages or emails, iOS automatically limits the amount of text that displays inside of your incoming notifications. In most cases, this means unlocking your device to read the entire message rather than reading it from the Lock screen notification preview.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called MoreLinesNotifications by iOS developer CydiaGeek tries to solve this problem by maximizing the amount of text that each incoming notification displays.
* In the screenshot examples above, we demonstrate the length of a text message notification on the Lock screen both before and after installing MoreLinesNotifications. Evident right off the bat, the tweak makes it so that the notification displays more of the message’s content at a glance.
* MoreLinesNotifications imposes this expanded effect on all Lock screen and Notification Center-based notifications, but it doesn’t impact the notification banners that typically pop up throughout iOS (in apps, on the Home screen, etc.)
* For someone that gets involved in lengthy text message conversations all the time, MoreLinesNotifications provides useful functionality by letting you read more of your messages directly from Lock screen previews without unlocking your device.
* On the other hand, MoreLinesNotifications has its cons too. For example, the bulkier notification previews provide substantially less privacy concerning message content than iOS’ default-sized previews would. Furthermore, the extended notifications hog up more space, so you’ll scroll more frequently to see everything you missed.
* All in all, MoreLinesNotifications offers a cheap and simple solution to a problem that many iOS users have. If you’d like to give it a try, it’s available for free from CydiaGeek’s beta repository in Cydia. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices and doesn’t have any options to configure.
* To download MoreLinesNotifications, you’ll need to add Cydia Geek’s private repository through Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you should be able to find and install MoreLinesNotifications by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
