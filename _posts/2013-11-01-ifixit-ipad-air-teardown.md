* The iPad Air launched online and in retail stores around the globe this morning, and like clockwork, the folks over at iFixit have already ripped it apart. The teardown gives us a closeup look at the components inside the tablet.
* And this is particularly interesting this year, as Apple has completely redesigned the 5th gen iPad to be thinner, lighter and more powerful than its predecessor. You’ll find photos of its A7 chip, 5mp camera and more after the fold…

* The A7 chip has a part number of APL5698, which differs from the APL0698 chip found in the iPhone 5s. The Air’s processor is likely the 1.4GHz chip spotted in benchmark results earlier this week. And yes, the M7 is also on board.

* The iPad Air features a 32.9 Whr two-cell battery, which interestingly enough is smaller than the 43Whr three-cell battery found in the iPad 4. That Apple managed to keep the 10-hour battery life is a testament to the A7’s efficiency.

* As expected, the Air utilizes a 5-megapixel iSight camera and 1.2mp FaceTime camera—both of which are very similar to their predecessors. There microphone placement has changed though, with both now found at the top of the tablet.
* So not many surprises, but it’s still interesting to see what parts Apple put together to achieve the iPad Air’s size and performance. iFixit gives the device a 2 out of 10 repairability rating, and you can read the rest of the teardown here.
