* Google Cardboard may be the simplest, most affordable way to experience virtual reality content on a smartphone, but up until recently Google’s mobile YouTube app only supported Cardboard on Android.
* Beginning with YouTube for iOS version 11.18, which was released yesterday, iPhone owners can now watch YouTube in virtual reality mode on their device.
* Here’s how you can experience YouTube in VR mode on your iPhone.
* The mobile YouTube application lets you enjoy via your Cardboard both regular YouTube clips and those captured with special 360-degree cameras.
* The key benefit of watching a regular YouTube video in VR mode is the feeling of “being there”, as if you were sat in a cinema. You’ll, of course, also need a Cardboard viewer.
* Cardboard-compatible viewers come in many shapes, sizes and price points.
* Google’s own Cardboard supports screen sizes of up to six inches and starts at just $15, for example. To see all Cardboard-compatible viewers, visit the Google Cardboard website.
* 1) Launch the official YouTube app on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. You must have version 11.18 of the app, or later, which has built-in Cardboard support.
* 2) Begin playing any video.
* 3) Tap on the video to reveal on-screen icons and then hit the three vertical dots in the upper right corner to show additional options.

* 4) Tap the Cardboard icon to being playing the video in VR mode, including standard YouTube clips that weren’t originally filmed in 360 degrees.
* 5) Place your iPhone into the back of your Cardboard and watch the immersive YouTube clip in virtual reality through the lenses in the front.
