* The evad3rs have released an update to their evasi0n7 jailbreak tool this afternoon. The update, which brings the tool to version 1.0.7, includes a fix for a known issue where the bundled package lists could not be updated by Cydia.
* This is more of a maintenance update, as it doesn’t really add new features or benefits for people who aren’t experiencing the above problem. So unless you are seeing the issue, there’s no reason for you to restore and re-jailbreak…
* evasi0n7 1.0.7 is now live on http://t.co/kjpfxng23O – fixing problem where the bundled package lists could not be updated by Cydia.

* Thanks Marria!
