* It finally feels like we’re beginning to get into the swing of things as far as jailbreak content goes. We’re starting to see a flood of content dedicated to iOS 5, the iPhone 4S, and to a lesser extent, the iPad.
* One of the latest iOS 5 tweaks to hit the scene is ColorBanner, a tweak that allows you to customize the background color and font color of your Notification Center Banners…
* Users can select between 5 font colors and 10 background colors to spiffy up their banner notifications. As you will see in the video, some combinations are more ideal than others.
* It would be nice if the developer included some simple RGB sliders so that we could have an infinite number of color combinations at our disposal, but there is a provision to create custom themes for more advanced users.
* ColorBanner comes in at $1.99 on the Cydia store, which is admittedly $0.99 more than I thought it would be, but it may be worth it if you’re extremely eager to switch from iOS 5’s default banner style.
* Let us know what you think in the comments section.
