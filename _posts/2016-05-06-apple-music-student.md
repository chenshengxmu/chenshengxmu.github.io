* As first reported by TechCrunch, Apple’s begun offering half-price Apple Music subscriptions to students who are enrolled in an eligible college or university.
* Costing just $4.99 per month in the United States with the same features as the regular $9.99 per month plan for consumers, the fifty percent discount is now available to students in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.
* The company is working with UNiDAY, a student verification technology provider, to ensure that students who sign up are actually enrolled in classes.
* The 50 percent student discount is available for up to 4 years following enrollment. The years needn’t be continuous so those who take a break in between semesters can still sign up for a student membership when they return to school.
* “In addition, those who are enrolled in Master’s programs are also able to sign up for a student membership, as it’s aimed at anyone attending college or university, regardless of degree,” explains the publication.
* Both new and existing subscribers can sign up for the new plan from the web or the Apple Music mobile application for iOS and Android.
* Apple’s boss Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts last month that Apple Music currently claims thirteen million paying members, up from ten million subscribers two months prior.
* The service is said to be getting a much needed makeover this summer at WWDC, with an overhauled interface apparently being easier to use. Other improvements are in tow for Apple Music next month, too, including integration of lyrics, a new Browse section, combined music downloads and streaming and other enhancements.
