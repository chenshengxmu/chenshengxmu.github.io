* Star Wars Celebration ends today after a lot of stirrings in the Force. During the previous few days, both the newest Episode VII and Battlefront trailers were publicly released. Panels of cast members shared stories and hopes for the future, including classic cast members from Luke to Chewie to Leia and even the newest droid BB-8. Naturally, thousands of fans flocked to Anaheim for the occasion. If you want to follow along with the last day, make sure to download the official Star Wars Celebration app for either iPad or iPhone.
* Following the renewed excitement for Star Wars after the event, we compiled a small list of Star Wars wallpapers. We have never highlighted Star Wars wallpapers in a past Wallpapers of the Week post for a simple reason: there are way to many to choose from. Consequently, this post is in no way an attempt to provide access to all of the best Star Wars wallpapers ever created. Merely, this post is a single entry in the much larger world of Star Wars walls.
* To re-iterate, this is by no means an attempt to conclusively provide download links to the best Star Wars wallpapers. If this proves to be a topic of intense interest, we can sprinkle in more wallpapers as we proceed. The following images are in the sizes we were able to find. Consequently, there is not always access to both iPhone and iPad sizes.
