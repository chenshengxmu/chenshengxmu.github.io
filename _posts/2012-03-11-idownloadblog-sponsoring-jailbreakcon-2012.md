* Ever since the creation of iDB back in 2008, we have been focusing on everything jailbreak. We sure love reporting on news, rumors, and sharing tips and tricks, but the essence, the core of iDownloadBlog, is its devotion to the jailbreak community. That’s what we love to do. That’s in our DNA.
* Our comprehensive and in depth coverage of everything jailbreak is probably the reason why you started reading us in the first place, and chances are, that’s probably one of the reasons why you’re still reading us today.
* As a testament of our commitment to the jailbreaking cause, I am proud to announce today that iDownloadBlog is an exclusive sponsor of JailbreakCon 2012, the first jailbreak convention to ever take place in the United States…
* JailbreakCon, formerly known as MyGreatFest, was the first event of its kind, dedicated solely to jailbreaking. It took place last year in London, and after a name change and rebranding, it is now crossing the pond and coming to San Francisco on September 29th.
* There is already an incredible line up of jailbreak developers and hackers being booked to speak or attend JailbreakCon, such as Saurik and Ryan Petrich, just to name a few.
* We will of course cover all aspects of the event. As a matter of fact, I will be attending, and I believe Cody and Jeff also plan to be there. Armed with our VIP passes, we will bring to you exclusive interviews, tweak previews, behind the scene reports, and more. You won’t miss one piece of the action! We will also have a few giveaways going on during the next few months where you’ll be able to enter to win event passes, accessories, and merchandise.
* JailbreakCon will also be a great occasion for us to meet with some of our readers. We sometimes chat in the comments section or on Twitter, but nothing’s better than a good old face to face meeting. Until we meet, make sure to book your JailbreakCon tickets now at the early bird prices. Those will go up in the near future, so hurry!
