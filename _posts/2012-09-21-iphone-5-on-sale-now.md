* As expected, Apple’s sixth-generation iPhone is today on sale in the United States and eight international markets (Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore). The handset comes in 16/32/64GB flavors, priced at $199/$299/$399 with a two-year contract with your wireless operator.
* In addition to AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, regional U.S. telcos C Spire and Alaska’s GCI and Appalachian Wireless announced plans to carry the iPhone 5, in addition to prepaid carrier Cricket Wireless.
* As was the case with past launches, contract-free versions are expected to be available at a later stage in the U.S., unlike some international markets where carriers either choose or are mandated by law to provide contract-free alongside subsidized units. Here are some nice launch day photos…
* The iPhone 5 is estimated to cost carriers an estimated $10 billion in upfront subsidy.
* Apple started accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 5 on September 14 at 12:01am.

* The Verge, which took the iPhone 5 to Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, stressed that one can only begin to appreciate the device when held in hand.
* While the basic design of the phone mimics the look of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, the actual components, materials, sizing, and weight make it seem like another device entirely… When running graphically-intensive games, there are clearly some improvements in frame rates, as well as a noticeable lack of stutter on the iPhone 5.
* And thanks to the twice as fast A6 chip, the iPhone 5 runs smoothly and shows no laginess.
* General multitasking and app performance was superb. In particular, the new Maps 3D Flyover view pushed the phone hard, and the differences between the older and newer models was clear.
* Basically — there’s not much to complain about when it comes to speed on the new phone. It’s really, really fast.
* Here’s a quick video by The Verge.
* Strong demand is evident in pushing estimate which at the U.S. online Apple Store still sat at 3-4 weeks at press time.
