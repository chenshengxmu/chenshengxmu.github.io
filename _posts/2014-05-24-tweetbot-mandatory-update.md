* The Tapbots issued updates for their Tweetbot Twitter clients on iOS last night, bringing the iPhone app to version 3.3.2 and the iPad version to 2.8.8. Both change logs note that these are critical updates, and that older versions of Tweetbot will soon stop working.
* The developers published a post on their blog to better explain the situation, noting that folks from Twitter’s Platform Operations group contacted them a few weeks ago asking them to make a small change in the way that Tweetbot talks with the Twitter API…
* From the Tapbots blog:
* A couple weeks ago Twitter’s Platform Operations group contacted us and asked us to make a small change to the way Tweetbot communicates with the Twitter API. This change will have no affect on the way Tweetbot works, however two things will occur once this change goes live. All versions of Tweetbot prior to 2.8.8 or 3.2.2 will stop working and you may need to log into your account again. So make sure you are running the latest versions of the app and be prepared to authenticate your account once more. We will be coordinating with Twitter to make the final change on May 29th at 10 A.M. PST. Stay up to date via our @tweetbot account. Thanks for your continued support!
* That Twitter would ask the Tapbots to make such a change isn’t surprising. The social network has long enforced strict rules regarding how third-party clients interact with its API, including the limiting of authentication tokens a few years ago, which caused quite an uproar.
* Anyway, if you happen to be a Tweetbot user, you’ll definitely want to make sure your iPhone and iPad apps are up-to-date this weekend—at this time it doesn’t look like the Mac client is included. You can find both of the apps in the App Store for $4.99 and $2.99 respectfully.
