* Did you purchase your current iPhone 6 for $15 per month through T-Mobile’s JUMP! On Demand trade-in program? If so, you’ll be automatically eligible for a free upgrade to Apple’s ‘iPhone 6s’—or whatever it will be called when it’s released this fall.
* In addition to permitting its Simple Choice customers to listen to their favorite songs on Apple Music without taking a byte of their monthly 4G LTE data, carrier T-Mobile today announced that iPhone customers participating in said upgrade plan will be able to get their hands on Apple’s next-gen handset without paying anything to upgrade or increasing their monthly JUMP! On Demand payment.
* The promotional offer applies automatically to everyone who already got an iPhone for $15 per month via the JUMP! On Demand trade-in program. Qualifying credit is required.
* “When customers are ready to upgrade, they walk into a store, hand over their existing iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and walk out with an upgraded iPhone – nothing out of pocket and no increase in monthly cost,” said the carrier.
* If your monthly iPhone payment is already less than $15, you won’t be eligible for this offer nor will you get to keep your current monthly price when you upgrade.
* T-Mobile lays out who precisely is eligible to take advantage of this offer:
* And if you choose to upgrade to an ‘iPhone 6s’ or ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ within the first 48 hours of their availability, T-Mobile will treat you to priority shipping “So you’ll be among the very first to get your brand new phone when we have inventory.” Here’s T-Mobile CEO John Legere delivering the announcement in his trademark presentation style.
* If you aren’t a T-Mobile customer but plan on becoming one and want to be eligible for the free iPhone 6s upgrade, you’ll need to buy your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus before Labor Day, meaning through September 8, in order to lock in the $15 per month JUMP! On Demand price for the next iPhone model.
* “Take in your current device and get an amazing price on iPhone 6 now, then upgrade to a new comparable iPhone later this year for the same price,” reads the blurb.

* The iPhone offer details are available on T-Mobile’s website.
* This promotion is in-store only.
* Apple usually refreshes iPhones in September and this year should be no different so we’re assuming the next iPhone will be launching in the usual fall timeframe.
* Today’s iPhone 6s upgrade offer, along with the addition to Apple Music to Music Freedom, marks the last of T-Mobile’s Un-Carrier Amped moves this summer.
