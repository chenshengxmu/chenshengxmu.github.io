* If you haven’t quite finished your holiday shopping yet, you’ll be happy to know that Apple has announced that it will be hosting a Black Friday sale this week. “Black Friday” is the Friday after Thanksgiving and is generally the busiest shopping day of the year.
* On this day, retailers offer substantial discounts on their products to attract customers into their stores. Apple participated in the festivities last year by knocking up to $100 off its Macs and iOS devices, and it looks like its gearing up for another sale this year…
* Banners have started appearing on Apple’s online store in the UK, Italy, and other countries (at the time of this writing, they haven’t appeared on the US site) indicating that the Mac-makers will be holding some kind of sale this Friday.
* The text on the banners reads:
* “The special one-day Apple shopping event. This Friday, November 25. Mark your calendar now, and come back to the Apple Online Store for the special one-day event. You’ll discover amazing iPad, iPod and Mac gifts for everyone on your list.”
* As aforementioned, Apple’s Black Friday sales are generally lackluster in comparison with other retailers. But given that Apple is shooting for its biggest quarter ever, there’s a small chance that we could see it offer some decent discounts online this Friday.
