* Japanese blog Mac Otakara has heard from reliable sources that Apple is gearing up to refresh its iPad lineup in Spring of 2017 with an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, a new 10.1-inch model joining the lineup and a fifth-generation iPad mini, which should gained the ‘Pro’ moniker and be marketed by Apple simply as the 7.9-inch iPad mini Pro.
* For the most part, the outlet corroborated a previous report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with one major difference: Kuo claimed Apple would be releasing a 10.5-inch model iPad Pro model next year, not the 10.1-inch device mentioned in Mac Otakara’s report.
* The 12.9-inch iPad Pro should gain a twelve-megapixel iSight camera (the same as on the iPhone 7?), as well as True Tone flash and wide color gamut P3 display, both of which are found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.
* The next iPad mini is said to be called the 7.9-inch iPad Pro. That device, according to Mac Otakara’s sources, should come outfitted with a Smart Connector and a four-speaker setup as found on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, plus a twelve-megapixel iSight camera, True Tone flash and wide color P3 display.
* As for a rumored new 10.1-inch iPad Pro model, the report states that the device will be 1 centimeter longer and 0.5cm wider than the 9.7-inch iPads. The report adds that all three iPad models coming in 2017 will have four microphones, presumably to improve Siri reception in both landscape and portrait orientation.
* Lastly, Mac Otakara is adamant that the upcoming iPads won’t drop the 3.55 mm headphone jack like the iPhone 7 series has. The devices should release in Spring 2017.
