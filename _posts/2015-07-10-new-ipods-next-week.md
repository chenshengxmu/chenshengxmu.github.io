* If you’re buying an iPod music player these days, hold off your purchase for just a little bit longer as Apple is thought to be unveiling new iPod touch, iPod nano and iPod shuffle models next Tuesday.
* According to French blog iGen.fr, a pretty reliable source of Apple leaks, the iPod touch could get a substantial refresh in the form of a 64-bit processor.
* The iPod nano and shuffle models are said to be receiving only cosmetic changes.
* The fifth-generation iPod touch was unveiled in October 2012 with the Apple-designed 32-bit A5 processor. In June 2014, the device received a minor update as Apple dropped the 32/64GB models to $249/$299 and introduced a new $199 16GB model.
* Hidden assets in iTunes 12.2 suggest a refresh to the iPod lineup may be around the corner.
* When setting up or restoring an iPod in iTunes 12.2, the user is greeted with a new splash image, shown top of post and further below, which depicts the iPod family in previously unseen colors: gold, dark blue and bright pink.

* Interestingly, the Calendar app on the iPod touch shows the Tuesday 14 date, but it’s unclear whether Apple is just trolling us or if that’s the actual launch date.
* The $49 iPod shuffle was last updated nearly two years ago.
* As for the iPod nano, the device saw its last significant hardware refresh in September 2012, with a minor September 2013 update replacing the previous Slate color option with a new Space Gray colorway.
* Do you still care about the iPod?
