* Now that TaiG has updated its iOS 8.3 jailbreak to play nice with Cydia Substrate, it’s time to start exploring the vast library of jailbreak apps and tweaks available on Cydia. If you’re new to Cydia, or even if you’ve just been out of the game for a while, it can be overwhelming.
* With this in mind, I’ve compiled a video that showcases 50 different jailbreak tweaks. My goal isn’t to be super extensive with the coverage of each tweak, but it’s to provide you with an overview of some of the things that are out there and some of the stuff that is possible with jailbreaking.
* Watch our video, and be impressed by the sheer breadth and variety of the Cydia catalog!
* **Note: some of these will only be downloadable if you previously purchased. This will change once the dev “flips the switch”.
* Here are the tweaks showcased in the video:
