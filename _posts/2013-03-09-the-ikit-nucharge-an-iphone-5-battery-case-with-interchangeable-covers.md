* When it comes to battery cases for the iPhone 5, there’s no shortage of options. Mophie itself offers a few choices—the Juice Pack Air and the Helium Juice Pack—and there are countless offerings from other third party manufacturers.
* But that doesn’t mean the space couldn’t use another contender. And the folks of Shark Design think they have what it takes to be a big one with their iKit NuCharge. They say it’s the “most advanced iPhone battery case ever made…”
* Looking at the NuCharge’s feature list, it certainly seems impressive. It’s packing an interchangeable 1900mAh battery—bigger than Mophie’s Juice Pack—a kickstand, interchangeable covers, and it’s all MFi (Made for iPhone) certified.
* But as you can see in the video, this isn’t your typical battery case. The base of it is a thin slip-on cover, and the battery pack attaches to the back of it, connecting to your iPhone via a built-in cable. This does, however, allow for easy port access.
* If any of this sounds appealing, you’ll want to head over to the iKit NuCharge Kickstarter page for more information. The project has about 20 days left to reach its goal of $15,000, and a pledge of just $59 will help them out and score you a case.
* Admittedly, I probably won’t be buying one. I’m not really in the market for a battery case, and this NuCharge still seems a tad bit bulky for me. But for those who are looking to double their iPhone’s battery life, this certainly seems worth considering.
* What do you think?
