* So, 30 seconds just wasn’t enough for you decide whether or not you liked the latest Miley Cyrus record? Have no fear, the iTunes Store Team understands your needs for good, unadulterated, bubble gum pop… they’ve got your back.
* Apple recently sent out a notice informing label representatives that they will be bumping up the music preview time in the United States by a whopping 60 seconds. That’s quite a lot when it seems like most songs these days are about 3 minutes of hook, and about 30 seconds of lyrics…
* The folks on the iTunes Store Team state that they will be bumping song previews up to 90 seconds from 30 seconds, and that they “…believe that giving customers more time to listen to your music will lead to more purchases.” While that’s certainly debatable, it’ll undoubtedly be a popular move with consumers. As far as the artist’s and label’s thoughts on this goes, the jury is still out.
* Fortunately, this only applies to music over 2 minutes and 30 seconds in length.  All songs falling under that length will stay with the current 30 second preview times.
* I like this idea, but I’m not sure how I’d feel if I was an artist. Do you think this will help your music purchasing decisions going forward?
