* We’ve created an easy-to-follow video tutorial that shows you how to add the hidden panorama mode to iOS 5’s Camera app.
* You will need a jailbroken iOS 5 device in order to do it, and you will also need iFile if you want to follow this specific tutorial.
* If you meet those prerequisites, step inside to see how to enable panorama mode on iOS 5…
* Step 1: Open iFile and Navigate to /var/mobile/Library/Preferences
* Step 2: Tap on com.apple.mobileslideshow.plist and select Property List Viewer
* Step 3: Tap the ‘+’ button in the bottom right-hand corner
* Step 4: In the name field type: EnableFirebreak. In the Type field select: Boolean
* Step 5: Tap Create in the upper right-hand corner and turn the switch to “on for EnableFirebreak, then tap done.
* Step 6: Exit iFile, and respring your device
* Step 7: Open the Camera app, tap options, and tap Panorama
* Again, you will need a jailbroken device running iOS 5 to do this. You will also need a device with a built in gyroscope (iPhone 4, etc).
* Update: chpwn released FireBreak which allows you to easily enable panorama mode. The tweak is available now in Cydia. If you don’t feel like editing playlist values, this is your best bet.
* Did it work for you? How do you like Panorama mode?
