title: Most Apple owners say free service keeps them coming back
---
* Despite thoughts of a service call as akin to a root canal, iPhone maker Apple has turned service into a selling point. Nearly 60 percent of current Apple device owners say they’ll buy another product from the Cupertino, Calif. company as the result of in-store service.

* According to a survey by NPD Group, almost 90 percent of consumers who used Apple’s Genius Bar tech service rated the experience extremely or very satisfying. “A major part of their satisfaction came from the fact that only a small percentage actually paid for their service. According to the report, 88 percent of Genius Bar consumers said their service was free compared to 78 percent of all consumers.”
* “People tend to associate any type of tech support as a negative experience, but Apple has demonstrated that those ‘negatives’ can be turned into positive brand experiences and result in a trip back to the store,” said NPD vice president Stephen Baker.
* In another break from tradition, in-store tech support is something Apple customers eagerly anticipate. The online survey of 2,000 adults found 53 percent were “extremely satisfied with their in-store experience.” Young consumers, accustom to turning to the Internet for answers, actually preferred going to the Apple Store for service.
* What do you think? Do you enjoy taking your Apple product in for service?
