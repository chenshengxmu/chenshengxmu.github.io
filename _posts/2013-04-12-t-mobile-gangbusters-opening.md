* T-Mobile kicked off sales of Apple’s popular smartphone by airing its first iPhone ad yesterday evening. The ice-breaker commercial is part of the reportedly massive nationwide campaign, with print and digital ads to follow soon after. While the carrier did not release the official first-dale sales data at press time – and probably won’t until its next earnings report – its marketing honcho did bother taking to blogs to say T-Mobile saw “gangbusters” opening, whatever that means in terms of hard data.
* Be that as it may, the addition of T-Mobile, the nation’s fourth-largest wireless carrier, to the list of US carriers selling Apple’s handset is bound to improve Apple’s bottom line. Any iPhones T-Mobile sold won’t be reflected in Apple’s second fiscal 2013 quarter, which ended last month. The Cupertino company announced it will be releasing earnings on April 23…
* Ina Fried, reporting for AllThingsD, quoted T-Mobile’s Chief Marketing Office Mike Sievert as saying:
* Today has been gangbusters for T-Mobile. We experienced lines out the door this morning at nearly all of our almost 3,000 stores nationwide.
* TmoNews, the publication focused on tracking all things T-Mobile, wrote yesterday the carrier apparently had dispersed at least 240,000 iPhone 5 units to company owned-retail stores for today’s launch.

* More units have likely arrived earlier in the day.

* T-Mobile sells the iPhone 5 for $99.99 down and $20 per month over the next 24 months. The 32GB/64GB versions are $199/$299 down. The iPhone 4S is $70 down plus $20 per month for 24 months and the iPhone 4 costs $15 down and $15 per month over the next 24 months.
* At these rates, a full price iPhone is actually cheaper at T-Mobile than it is at the Apple store.
* T-Mobile’s new Simple Choice Plan offers unlimited talk, text and web, with upgrades including unlimited data (an extra $20), a second line (an extra $30, or $10 a month for each additional line) and more.
