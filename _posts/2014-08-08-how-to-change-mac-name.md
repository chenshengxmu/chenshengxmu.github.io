* While working on a series of post about Find My iPhone recently, I realized that my iMac didn’t have a specific name attached to it. When in Find My iPhone, it would just show up saying “Unknown.”. I wasn’t sure how that happened, but I knew I wanted to have a proper name for it, just so I could recognize it when looking for it on the local network.
* The steps to set or change a Mac’s name are quick and easy, but I figured that if you already know how to do it, maybe this post will be a reminder for you to check that your Mac has indeed been attributed a name. If not, I’ll show you how to do just that…
* Step 1: In the Menu bar, go to  > System Preferences…
* Step 2: Click on Sharing.

* Step 4: Close the window, and you’re done.
* As always, feel free to ask if you have any question.
