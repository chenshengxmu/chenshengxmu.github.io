* The Daily, a News Corporation-run digital newspaper that exclusively debuted on the iPad in January of last year, is finally available for the iPhone. Following a 15-month wait, the iPad-only publication has now been reformatted for the iPhone.
* It’s still based on a recurring subscription model, with a caveat: The iPhone-only subscription is priced 50 percent lower than on the iPad, yet offers the same features like social sharing and commenting, 360-degree photos, interactive charts and more…
* Just like its iPad counterpart, The Daily for iPhone is a free download The Daily for iPhone – The Daily Holdings, Inc. from the App Store, but you’re gonna have to subscribe to content for $1.99 a month, or $19.99 a year.
* This is half the asking price of the iPad subscription which stands at $0.99 a week, or $39.99 a year. iPad subscribers also get to enjoy full access to the newspaper content on their iPhone free of charge.
* Those unwilling to take the plunge still get to read a chosen few articles for free every day.
* Your release notes:
* • 7 sections updated every day: News, Business, Gossip, Opinion, Arts & Life, Apps & Games, and Sports • over 100 pages of original content every single day of the year—designed for the iPad • world-class editors and contributors like Sasha Frere-Jones (Arts & Life) and Gary Vaynerchuk (Business) • 360-degree photos and immersive photography that take you deeper inside the story • interactive charts, info-graphics and clickable hot spots • in-app commenting — including audio comments • your favorite sports’ teams scores, news and photos • you can save articles to read later and share them with your friends e-mail, Twitter and Facebook
* Here, a couple screenies…

* In addition to iPad and iPhone versions, The Daily is also available for Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 and on Facebook.
* Now, how about that universal binary instead of two separate downloads?
* Also, if you could please re-write the app from scratch because it’s a shame that the iPad version is one of the most sluggish digital newspapers out there.
* I must comment that I very much wanted to subscribe to this digital newspaper, but soon changed my mind.
* It’s not that the price is unreasonable – not at all – I just find their content lacking.
* Besides, Rupert Murdoch, man!
* Are you subscribed to The Daily?
