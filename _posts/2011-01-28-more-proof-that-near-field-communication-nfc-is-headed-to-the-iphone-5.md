* Who wants to buy some apples with their iPhone? We do! We do! And it looks like the possibility of that happening has grown stronger in the last few months.
* First, back in August 2010, Apple hired, Benjamin Vigier, who is an expert in Near Field Communications.
* Then, three days ago we told you how Apple is indeed planning on including NFC in its future mobile endeavors; endeavors, which would allow users to make purchases directly with their handsets.
* Now, Apple has posted additional jobs: one for a global payments expert, and one for someone with RFID experience. Is this just a big coincidence, or are credit cards destined to go the way of the dodo?
* Excerpt from Manager Global Payment Platforms job listing:
* Global Payment Platforms is responsible for managing the customer payment options and business partnerships (internal and external) that allow Apple’s customers to purchase product at our Online Store, iTunes, and Retail stores. The group is cross functional in nature, and will focus on developing global solutions to support these business units.
* The individual in this role will contribute to the analysis and development of new payment types and processes for the various business units. The goal is to maximize efficiencies and scalability across all platforms while reducing costs, increasing controls, and establishing and advancing best payment practices.
* Excerpt from iPhone HW Test Engineer job listing:
* You will be exposed to various fields as ICT, FCT, RF, Audio, Acoustics, Video, Sensors, … You will be integral part of New Product Introduction and work cross-functionally with multiple Apple Engineering teams: PD, EE, SW, DFM, …
* As you may be aware, RF is a form of NFC that’s currently in existence today. Perhaps you’ve heard of the term RFID?
* Some credit card companies utilize that today with RF capabilities built right into their cards. This allows customer to simply “tap” their cards against a small kiosk, rather than swipe or punch in their numbers.
* Reportedly, Apple removed the “ID” from “RFID” in their job description, so that it wouldn’t seem so blatantly obvious.
* Apple, it’s still blatantly obvious what you’re doing.
* Who’s ready to buy their groceries with their iPhones?
