* If you’ve been trying to update your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to the newly released iOS 5, you might have encountered the error message saying that you’re device could not be restored because an “internal error occurred.” In most cases, you’ll get the “3004” error message, too.
* If that’s the case, do not freak out. Breath and relax. Apple’s servers are getting slammed with thousands of people trying to do the exact same thing as you…
* The same applies if you are getting Error 3200, or any other error for that matter.
* My suggestion? Sit back, and check back in an hour or two. That is if you can live without iOS 5 for a few more hours, of course. If that’s not the case, well, then hit that refresh button over and over again until it works!
