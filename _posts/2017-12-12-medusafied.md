* One of the significant distinctions separating the iOS experience on the iPad from the iPhone is the inclusion of various multitasking features like Slide Over and Split View.
* Apple typically bars iPhone users from accessing these features out of the box because of their limited screen real estate. On the other hand, a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Medusafied by iOS developer Sniper_GER can change that.
* After installing Medusafied, you can begin using these gestures on your iPhone without any configuration required.
* If you’re using an app in portrait orientation, you can swipe in from the right edge of your display to access the Slide Over menu, as shown above. Here, you can pick an app to use alongside your current app and make it simpler to access features between the two.
* You’ll also notice a grabber just to the left of the app. You can drag the grabber over to the right to hide the overlaying app and return to the original at any time.
* If you happen to be using an app in landscape mode, then you can use the same gesture to access Split View:

* With Split View, you can use two apps side-by-side simultaneously. Unlike Slide Over, Split View doesn’t forefront one app over the other, and each app has equal priority in your workspace. You can use the slider in the center of the screen to adjust each app’s width on demand.
* With no options to configure, Medusafied is incredibly simple to use and an excellent way to access iPad-exclusive multitasking features on your jailbroken iOS 10 iPhone. While it’s not the first jailbreak tweak to bring iPad-style multitasking gestures to jailbroken iPhones, it’s well-made and worthy of attention.
* If you’re interested in trying Medusafied, then you’ll need to add the FESTIVAL repository to your Cydia app, as the tweak isn’t hosted in BigBoss. To do that, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you can find and install Medusafied by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
* Given just how exhilarating it can be to use iPad-style multitasking gestures on your jailbroken iPhone, is this a tweak you’d consider downloading? Let us know in the comments section below.
