* Apple has hired famed robotics expert Yoky Matsuoka, a former head of technology at the smart thermostat maker Nest before it was acquired by Google and one of the co-founders of the search giant’s X Lab, a research and development unit tasked with conceiving moonshot projects.
* According to her LinkedIn profile, she won a MacArthur Foundation grant in 2007 for a neurorobotics project that helped disabled people and stroke victims regain the use of their limbs. Fortune has confirmed with an Apple representative that Matsuoka will work on health-related initiatives at the Cupertino firm.
* She will report directly to Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams who is charged with leading Apple’s global health initiatives such as HealthKit, ResearchKit and CareKit, among his other responsibilities.
* In a Medium post last May, titled “Getting Another Chance on Life,” Matsuoka revealed that after leaving Nest she was headed to Twitter until being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Following the effective treatment of undisclosed illness, she made the decision not to join Twitter after all.
* In this 2014 video, Matsuoka can be seen discussing how brain signals can control prosthetic limbs, and other advances in the hybrid field of neuroscience and robotics.
* After moving to the United States from Japan, Matsuoka attended the University of California where she developed strong interest in robotics. At MIT, where she got a Ph.D., Matsuoka helped develop a revolutionary robotic arm.
* She also spend a decade at Carnegie Mellon University as the director of the neurobotics laboratory and the University of Washington in Seattle as a professor of robotics. One of her students at Carnegie Mellon was Matt Rogers, who co-founded Nest with former Apple engineer and “iPod Godfather” Tony Fadell.
