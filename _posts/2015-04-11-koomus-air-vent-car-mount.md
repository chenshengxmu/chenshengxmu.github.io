* In some states, it is illegal to mount anything to your dashboard or windshield. However, it is much less safer to hold you iPhone in your hand while driving when trying to follow directions. One alternative is the air vent mount.
* Koomus makes an air vent mount that stretches from 1.5 inches to 3.5 inches, so you can secure your iPhone 6 to your car without it blocking any view through your windshield.
* The mount has a rubber-finished clip on the backside that is pushed onto a car’s air vent louvers. The adjustable ball head allows for 360-degree rotation. The stretchable clamp starts at just 1.5 inches. When opened, it can fit a device measuring 3.5-inches wide. The rubber grip inside the clamp protect from scratches.
* The mount is designed to be universal, and can fit smartphones with or without cases. Because the ball head rotates 360 degrees, it makes it easier to allow for air flow from the vent it is mounted to.
* The base is designed to rest against the other vent louvers so it doesn’t flop around quite so much. However, air vent mounts are a tricky product since there are so many different kinds across so many models of car.
* There is no real list for what cars do or don’t work with the Koomas. The vent clip is .75 inches long and .5 inches wide. Under the Customer Questions and Answers section for this mount on Amazon, one person described how to determine if it is compatible with your car’s air vent. The outside louvers must measure at least one inch. Or, if they measure less than one inch, they must be at least three-quarters of an inch from the inside louvers in order to fit. Of course, this is a customer comment, and not official information from the company.
* Koomas’ Universal Air Vent Smartphone Car Mount is available in black or white on Amazon for $16. Because the clamp stretches to 3.5 inches, it is also compatible to the iPhone 6 Plus, which is 3.06 inches wide.
