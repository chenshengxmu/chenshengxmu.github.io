* There are quite a few iBooks purchases that I’ve made in the past that I don’t wish to show in my iBooks library. Most of the books that I wish to hide are books with outdated content, such as iOS 7 or iOS 8 user guides, and other time sensitive material.
* Thankfully, it’s easy to hide iBooks stored in iCloud to prevent them from being displayed within the iBooks library. Hiding iCloud books is super easy and can be done directly from the iBooks app on iOS.

* Step 1: Launch the iBooks app on your Mac.
* Step 2: In the Menu Bar, click on View, then select Hide iCloud Books.
* Any book stored in iCloud that hasn’t been downloaded will be hidden from view. If you wish to display certain books from iCloud, make sure you tap the cloud download button to download them first before hiding iCloud books.
* As someone who has a ton of books stored in iCloud, this is the only way that I can keep my library looking neat and tidy.
