* Just a few hours ago, we rounded up a list of iOS 8 features that Apple simply didn’t have much time to mention at its WWDC keynote this afternoon. One of them was Wi-Fi calling, which allows iPhone users to place calls over Wi-Fi as opposed to a cellular network. The feature allows for wireless customers to potentially save money on their monthly plans, which you would think is something that carriers would be against.
* Not T-Mobile. Being the awesome underdog carrier that it has been as of late, the magenta-flavored company has embraced the feature with full arms. Earlier today, T-Mobile marketing chief Mike Sievert confirmed in a news release (via MacRumors) that Wi-Fi calling will be enabled for iPhone users on iOS 8, meaning that over 90% of smartphones on the network will be capable of the feature… 
* Sievert calls Wi-Fi calling on T-Mobile an advanced product:
* Since we launched Wi-Fi Calling over seven years ago, our engineers have continued to deliver quality and user experience enhancements. As a result, our service is one of the most advanced natively-integrated Wi-Fi Calling products in the U.S. We have the deep technical knowledge and the close partnerships with device manufacturers to deliver the Wi-Fi call quality wireless consumers have come to expect from the Un-carrier.
* iPhone users will simply need to make sure that Wi-Fi calling is enabled to make use of the feature, with no app or additional setup required. There are several benefits to Wi-Fi calling, including improved call quality and battery life. As I previously mentioned, another obvious benefit is that iPhone users can save minutes and data towards their plan, which could potentially mean additional savings in their pockets.
* Will you make use of Wi-Fi calling?
