* AirDrop is a file transmission tool that first debuted in OS X Lion. Prior to iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, the AirDrop protocols between Mac and iOS were not compatible. This incompatibility made AirDrop worthless in the eyes of many, as most casual users would prefer to exchange data between a Mac and an iOS device, instead of two Macs.
* The AirDrop issue has been solved in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. AirDrop now works beautifully between a Mac and an iPhone, or a Mac and an iPad. It’s a great way to make quick transmissions between local devices. Watch our video walkthrough after the break for a demonstration of AirDrop in action.
* To use AirDrop, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be enabled on both devices, but the devices don’t have to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. You can manage AirDrop discovery on your Mac by clicking on the AirDrop folder in the Finder.
* To send a file to your iPhone from your Mac, simply drag it on your iPhone’s icon in the AirDrop folder in the Finder. You can also use the share extensions found in OS X Yosemite to send files via AirDrop.
* Now that iOS and OS X play nice together, the concept of AirDrop makes a lot more sense. The question is, do you plan on using AirDrop between your devices?
