* Accessory maker Logitech today announced a brand new lineup of Folio cases, Bluetooth keyboard cases and protective covers specifically designed for Apple’s newly-launched iPad Air, which goes on sale this coming Friday. The Ultrathin Keyboard Folio and Cover, the FabricSkin Keyboard Folio and the Folio Protective Case are all now available for pre-order today and slated to ship in November. I’ve included more information and a few images right after the break…
* Logitech says it engineered these accessories to provide protection against accidental bumps, scratches and spills while remaining ultra-thin and light and matching your iPad Air’s thin and light appearance. The products are engineered from “state-of-the-art materials” (aren’t they always?).
* The $149.99 FabricSkin Keyboard Folio is water-resistant, weighs only 425 grams (0.9 pound), measures 0.7 inches thick, provides two-sided protection and comes in three colors and with a built-in Bluetooth keyboard containing full-size keys, including iOS shortcut keys for copy, paste, undo and more. It runs up to three months on a single charge.

* The $99.99 Ultrathin Keyboard Cover measures just 7.3mm (0.29 inches) thick, weighs 330 grams (0.73 pound) and features the aluminum cover that only protects the front of your tablet. There’s also a built-in keyboard with up to three months of battery life. It comes in three color choices.

* The $99 Ultrathin Keyboard Folio has an integrated Bluetooth keyboard with iOS shortcut keys, weighs 425 grams (0.9 pound), measures 20.1mm (0.79 inches) thick and looks like an offspring of the FabricSkin Keyboard Folio. The accessory is available in four  colors and features a three-month battery life, but is not water-resistant.

* At 261 grams (0.58 pounds), the keyboard-less $49.99 Folio Protective Case is Logitech’s thinnest and lightest Folio for the iPad Air. It measures 14mm (0.546 inches) thick, covers both the front and back of your iPad Air and has a water-repellent skin for two-sided protection against bumps, scratches sand spills, while doubling as a stand. It comes in four different colors.

* I’m liking the Folio series a lot as it doubles as a tablet stand for reading, watching movies and playing games. Logitech’s VP and Mobility lead Mike Culver agrees as much, saying the Folio series offers comfortable viewing angles.
* He also praised his company’s attention to detail.
* Even the color and size of the new Ultrathin Keyboard Cover perfectly match the size and external colors of the new iPad to deliver beautiful protection iPad users expect and appreciate from Logitech.
* You can pre-order these by clicking on the above links. The products will be available in the United States, Europe and select countries in Asia in November 2013.
