* Chrome users will be happy to hear that Google has announced that it’s adding the autofill feature from its desktop and Android app to the iOS client today, making it much easier to fill out online forms.
* And the feature will of course sync information with your Google account. So as long as you’re logged in on your iOS device, you will be able to auto-complete forms that you’ve already filled out elsewhere…
* From Google’s blog post:
* “Today, we’re starting to roll out new features on Chrome for mobile to help save you time and hassle while you’re on-the-go.
* For iPhone and iPad users, Chrome for iOS will soon include Autofill to help you quickly fill out forms on-the-go just as you can on desktop and Android. When you sign into Chrome on your iPhone and iPad, you can quickly complete online forms using your synced Autofill info from other devices you’ve signed into.”
* Back in October, marketing research firm Chitika issued a report with data showing that Chrome’s share of iOS web traffic in the US and Canada has doubled since it launched last year, going from 1.5% to 3%.
* The Chrome for iOS autofill update should be available later today, and you can grab it from the App Store by clicking here.
