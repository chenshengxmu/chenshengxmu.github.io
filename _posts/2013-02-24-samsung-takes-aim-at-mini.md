* It looks like the rumors were true. Samsung sent out a press release last night announcing the launch of its new Galaxy Note 8.0. The 8-inch tablet is clearly aimed right at the iPad mini, which has done very well thus far for Apple.
* And it certainly came prepared to play. As expected, the slate features a 1280×800 (720p) display—just a hair better than the mini—a quad core processor, 2GB of RAM, and oh yeah, it makes phone calls. More details after the break…
* Here’s an excerpt from the press release (via 9to5Google):
* “Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the 8 inch tablet, the GALAXY Note 8.0; a new era of intelligent Note technology set to re-ignite the mid-size tablet category that Samsung established in 2010. Providing unrivalled multimedia performance within a compact one-hand-grip screen, the GALAXY Note 8.0 has the power and advanced technology to evolve the tablet experience and ensure you achieve new levels of efficient multi-tasking while benefitting from superb voice call functionality.”
* In addition to the specs listed above, the Note 8.0 will also come with Samsung’s signature ‘S-Pen’ stylus, and a Micro-SD card slot for added storage. It won’t, however, support LTE—only HSPA+—and it’s running 5-month old software.

* Samsung hasn’t named a launch date for the new tablet yet, or a price tag. And that last detail is particularly important because it will tell us exactly what market it’s going after. From afar all signs point to an entry below the $300 mark.
* And if that ends up being the case, it’ll be really interesting to see how it performs against the iPad mini. Will the Note’s S-Pen and (still not sure how I feel about this) phone capabilities be able to throw some cold water on Apple’s hot tablet?
* I don’t think so. Though Android is getting better in the tablet space, I think the iPad still wins on ease-of-use and app selection, which are probably two of the most important factors for mainstream consumers, outside of what it costs.
* What’s your take on Samsung’s new tablet? What do you think of its ability to make phone calls?
