* As someone who records podcasts and records videos, I constantly find myself switching between the various audio input and output devices on my Mac. You can do this by venturing into the System Preferences and clicking on the Sound option, but that can really slow down your workflow when you need to switch between audio devices many times each day.
* I’ve found a tool that runs in the menu bar that makes switching between the different audio devices on the Mac a cinch; in fact, doing so is just a mere two clicks away. The utility is called Audio Switcher—a free tool available for anyone who wishes to switch between audio devices more efficiently.

* This is how you’d normally have to go about switching audio input or output
* Here is developer SpikeSoft’s description of its handy menu bar utility:
* Audio Switcher is a MacOS X utility that allows you to quickly switch your audio input/output between different components. It’s designed to work with a device such as Griffin Technology’s Powermate. Audio Switcher sits in the Status Bar, making it conveniently accessible from any application.
* I find that Audio Switcher works wonderfully with my Apogee One USB audio interface. It also allows you to switch your audio output to an AirPlay device like an Apple TV. The tool includes preferences for setting default audio inputs and outputs as well.

* The bottom line is that I could not see myself living without this lifesaver of a tool. I know I might sound spoiled, but for someone who switches between audio devices multiple times a day, it saves me a lot of time by always being available in my menu bar.
* Again, you can download Audio Switcher free of charge from SpikeSoft’s website. Please share your methods for switching between the various audio input and output devices on your Mac. Do you use a similar tool, and if so, how has it improved your workflow?
