* It’s been a while since we’ve updated our downgrade page, so we thought it was time to do so.
* Our new downgrade page is an overhauled comprehensive resource for all of your iOS downgrading needs. It now includes video tutorials, along with a section-by-section breakdown for some of the most frequently asked downgrading questions.
* Now the question remains: Do you know where to find it? Check inside for the answer…
* To find our new page, navigate to Hot Topics > Downgrade in our navigation bar above.
