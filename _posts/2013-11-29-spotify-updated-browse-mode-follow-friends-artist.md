* The Swedish streaming music startup Spotify has pushed a new update to its free iPhone and iPad client today. The new Spotify 0.9.1 enables the Browse mode on iPads, while bringing the ability to follow friends and artists, enabling the search/public toggle for playlists on the iPhone and introducing more responsive searching and revamped playlists, along with the usual bug fixes and performance improvements.
* Spotify, which received its major iOS 7 update on October 22, two months ago brought out the completely revamped Browse tab. Basically a new way to search for music, Browse taps a simplified interface for finding your favorite artists and albums or discovering new ones with just a few taps.
* Browse used to be iPhone-only, but today’s update brings the feature to iPad devices as well while replacing the old What’s New view…
* The ability to follow friends and artists to see their playlists and releases will be “soon available to all iPhone users,” the company mentions in release notes accompanying the 34.3MB download.
* Pictured top of post: the smarter and more responsive searching.
* Fans will appreciate a streamlined sign up and login for the iPhone and iPad and a new look for playlists. Both new-look playlists and the improved searching are staggered roll-outs so expect these features to become available to all iPhone users soon and don’t panic if they’re not immediately available to you after updating to Spotify 0.9.1.
* Here’s the improved search on iPad.
