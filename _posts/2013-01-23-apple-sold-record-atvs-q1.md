* Among some of the more interesting tidbits from Apple’s earnings call today was Tim Cook’s mention of Apple TV sales. The device has long been called a hobby by Cook and other Apple executives, but it doesn’t act like one.
* The Cupertino company sold over 2 million Apple TVs during last quarter, a record high for the company. That’s a 60% growth over last year’s first fiscal quarter, which is bigger than that of both the iPhone and the iPad…
* Of course, it was none other than Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster asking Cook about Apple’s future plans for TV that sparked the comment about Apple TV sales. And as usual, the CEO wouldn’t give him a direct answer.
* “This is an area of intense interest for us and remains that. I tend to believe that there is a lot we can contribute in this space and we continue to pull the string and see where it leads us. Don’t want to be more specific.”
* You would think Munster would realize by now, after asking the same question 3 or 4 conference calls in a row, that Tim isn’t going to answer any questions regarding Apple’s future product plans. It’s become somewhat of a joke.
* But Apple’s TV sales aren’t a joke. At $99 a pop, and 2 million sold, we’re talking about a $200 million dollar haul for the company in just three months. That’s more than a lot of companies—even larger ones—make in a year.
* Looking towards the future, Apple is widely expected to refresh its set top box this spring with a faster processor, and possibly more features. Despite the continuous rumors, there’s still no evidence of anything bigger coming.
