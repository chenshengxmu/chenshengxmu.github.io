* Yesterday, the Dev Team released one of the biggest updates to their RedSn0w utility in recent memory. The new version included a feature that allows A5 device owners to downgrade their firmware to one that is jailbreakable.
* But those with an iPhone 4S who only had SHSH blobs saved from iOS 5.0.1 (build 9A406) haven’t been able to use the new feature to downgrade. Until now. RedSn0w 0.9.11b2 brings support for the forgotten firmware…
* Back in December of last year, Apple seeded a minor iOS update for iPhone 4S users. It didn’t come with a new version number or anything, it was still 5.0.1. It just had a new build number: 9A406. The update was essentially a fix for a known SIM card problem.
* Well if you have SHSH blobs from 9A406, you can use the new version of RedSn0w to downgrade back to that firmware. It’s already available on our Downloads page, and we have tutorials on how to use it for both Mac and PC users.
* Any questions?
