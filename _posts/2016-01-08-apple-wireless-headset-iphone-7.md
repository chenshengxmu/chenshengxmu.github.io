* Apple is reportedly building brand new, completely wireless earphones that will fit inside of a user’s ear, along with a charging case, as per 9to5Mac.
* The in-house designed hardware is similar in concept to the Motorola Hint headset and Bragi’s new Dash and said to include a noise-cancelling microphone system. The accessory will be “a premium alternative” to a Lightning-enabled version of the EarPods headset that’s also in the works (EarPods are the wired in-ear headphones that came with your  iPhone).
* Three days ago, Japanese blog Macotakara first reported on Apple’s plans to bundle the iPhone 7 with a wireless headset. The following day, Fast Company said Apple is working with a supplier on a new noise-canceling technology to be used both in the iPhone 7 and the new earphones to help remove background noise in music playback and in phone calls.
* “The new headphones are likely to come with a carrying case that doubles as a rechargeable battery to juice up the headphones when they are not in use,” reads the story.
* To give you a better idea about the direction Apple is heading in with its purported wireless in-ear headphones, here’s Bragi’s new Dash.

* The design cals for a pair of wireless chips and separate batteries, meaning a “sub-4-hour battery life without use of the case would be expected.”

* Additionally, Apple is said to provide different-sized ear sleeves for the tiny earphones, which are “highly likely” to be sold separately from the iPhone 7.
* For en even better comparison, this is what Motorola’s Hint in-ear headset looks like. Apple’s new accessory should be similar in concept to the Hint.

* Prior reports have indicated that the next iPhone will lose its 3.5mm audio jack in favor of Bluetooth wireless headsets and Lightning-connected wired headphones.
* Apple reportedly hopes to launch the new earphones this fall alongside the iPhone 7 and other refreshed hardware.
