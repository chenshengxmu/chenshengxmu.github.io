* Popular YouTube tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, known by many as MKBHD, has posted an unboxing video for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The 5 minute clip offers an up-close look at both handsets, in Black and Jet Black respectively, as well as the design and contents of their packaging. Check it out below.
* There’s nothing groundbreaking revealed here, but this is the first proper unboxing video we’ve seen for Apple’s new flagship smartphones. If nothing else, it provides a nice look at the new Lightning EarPods, and the much-maligned adapter, and the difference between the new matte Black and Jet Black colorways.
