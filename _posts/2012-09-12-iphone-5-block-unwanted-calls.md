* As you know, iOS 6 comes with an improved stock Phone app which enables some interesting new call management features. For example, you can choose to reply to an incoming calls with a message or be reminded about it later.
* When a call comes in that you can’t answer right away, users can just swipe up to reveal options. Surprisingly, the Wall Street Journal claimed yesterday that iOS 6 also, among other things, includes new features that allow people to block unwanted calls…
* Jessica Vasceralo, writing for the Journal (emphasis mine):
* The next iPhone, which has been referred to internally by the code name N41, has been in the works for more than a year, a person familiar with the matter said.
* Apple is expected to tweak the smartphone’s shape with a slightly larger screen and a different shell, and it will work with wireless carriers’ fastest LTE networks and run new mobile software.
* That software, iOS 6, includes improvements to voice-activated assistant Siri, a new digital-coupon-and-passes service called Passbook, and new call-blocking features, among several others.
* Apple’s iOS 6 page makes no mention of call blocking in a way that could allude this being a brand new feature.
* iOS 6 adds new calling features to your iPhone. Now when you decline an incoming call, you can instantly reply with a text message or set a callback reminder. And when things are just too hectic, turn on Do Not Disturb and you won’t be bothered by anyone — except can’t-miss contacts like your boss or your better half.
* Because of that, we have some doubts related to the wording of the WSJ article.
* Perhaps the author though that “call-blocking features” is a cooler way of putting it?
* It’s possible the article refers to a known Do Not Disturb toggle in Settings which lets you mute all incoming notifications.

* Another option tucked away under the Notifications section in Settings even allows you to enable a scheduled Do Not Disturb mode that automatically kicks in, say, at midnight and ends at 8am.
* Of course, those that jailbreak their devices can easily silence Notification Center alerts using tweaks such as  DoNotDisturb and BannerDisable, or use other tweaks to block unwanted calls.
* At any rate, we will solve this and all other mysteries in less than an hour.
* Stay tuned for our extensive coverage of Apple’s presser.
