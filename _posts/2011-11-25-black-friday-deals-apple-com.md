* For those of you looking to score some Black Friday savings without standing outside of your local retailer all night long, you’ll be happy to know that Apple’s Black Friday sale has finally hit the US website.
* You’ll recall that we got an early glimpse at Apple’s Black Friday pricing yesterday. And as predicted, the discounts are fairly modest compared to other retailers…
* iPad 2 models, which are quickly selling out at Best Buy and other outlets, are between $41 and $61 off, depending on the capacity. All iPod touch models are also being discounted between $21 and $41, according to capacity.
* Apple’s in-house accessories are included in the sale, dropping the prices of Speck cases and other supplementary items like Jawbone’s Jambox bluetooth speaker considerably. All Mac computers are also discounted.
* Even though the sale isn’t earth-shattering, this is likely the best price you’ll find on the iPad and iPod touch this year. Apple rarely discounts, or allows its retailers to discount, current generation products.
* Keep in mind that the sale only lasts 24 hours, and hot ticket items like iPads and iPod touches are likely to go quickly.
* Have you found any deals yet?
