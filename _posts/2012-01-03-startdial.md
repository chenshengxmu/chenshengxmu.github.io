* Do you ever get annoyed when you open your Phone app and it doesn’t go to the section you were expecting?
* With StartDial, that problem is a thing of the past. StartDial allows you to always start at a specific section of your Phone app every time you open it by means of a predefined setting.
* It’s even smart enough to start at your recents whenever you have missed calls. If you make a lot of phone calls, and your iPhone is jailbroken, check out our hands-on experience with StartDial inside…
* StartDial will even let those who don’t use voicemail, or have alternative voicemail methods such as YouMail, disable the voicemail section in your Phone app completely.
* StartDial is a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and coming from developer Filippo Bigarella, you know the tweak is quality.
* What do you think?
