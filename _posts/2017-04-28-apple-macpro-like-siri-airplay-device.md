* After claiming on Twitter yesterday that Apple is currently working on finalizing the designs for its Echo rival that’s “expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device,” Australian leakster Sonny Dickson shared with MacRumors and on Twitter additional details about the device. It will allegedly run a version of iOS and include some form of Beats technology.
* “It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology,” he wrote on Twitter.

* The device should feature a MacPro-like concave top with built-in controls, with a speaker mesh portion covering it all. Sonny’s source, which he claims is “someone inside Apple,” has described the device as “fat”.
* More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple's Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2

* It’s said to take design cues from UE BOOM’s mesh styling.
* Allegedly codenamed “B238” internally, the gizmo could be formally announced at WWDC this June, he was told. Sonny previously claimed iOS 10.3 beta 1 would feature a Theater Mode, which eventually made its debut in watchOS 3.2.
* What do you guys make of this?
