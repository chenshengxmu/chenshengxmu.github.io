* That beautiful clock design in Apple’s new iPad Clock app in iOS 6 has evidently been copied from the Swiss Federal Railway service as they are the sole owner of the trademark and copyright of the railway clock. The Swiss firm, as previously reported, got in contact with Apple to talk the trademark dispute. According to a new report, its lawyers might be looking to eventually strike a licensing agreement of sorts with the Cupertino-based iPhone maker…
* According to AFP, the railway company on Friday dispatched its lawyers, who requested the meeting with Apple representatives.
* The Swiss Federal Railway doesn’t want to raise a stink about it and its spokeswoman Patricia Claivaz told the news gathering organization her company doesn’t want to “upset [Apple] by asking for money”.

* They’re also proud Apple chose the timeless clock design “for 80 million iPads”, adding:
* We’re rather proud that a brand as important as Apple is using our design, it’s already on show in exhibitions in places like New York.
* She dismissed claims that the Swiss Federal Railway service would seek financial compensation from Apple as pure “speculation”.
* I think Apple has to do the right thing here and cough up some money for licensing fees or some such.
* You?
