* With so much talk about the current-gen iPhone seeing weaker-than-expected demand swirling about, analysts and industry watchers have already begun to look forward to Apple’s next-generation handset, believed to be the ‘iPhone 5S.’
* The company is widely expected to break its handset’s traditional, annual release cycle this year, releasing the new iPhone well before fall. And a new report today supports that theory, saying Apple’s next smartphone will land in June…
* Jefferies analyst Peter Misek (via AppleInsider) said in a note to investors this morning that two next-gen iPhone prototypes are currently in testing. One is said to be the so-called ‘iPhone 5S,’ while the other could be the rumored budget model.
* The analyst’s report actually matches up with scoops from both DigiTimes and The Wall Street Journal, who have both said that prototypes for Apple’s next-gen handset are floating around its supply chain. The release dates, however, don’t.
* Misek says that Apple will begin preliminary builds of the ‘iPhone 5S’ in March, setting up for a debut in June or July. That contradicts a previous report though, which said the handset went into production in December for a Q1 2013 launch.
* Additionally, Misek says that the budget iPhone has already been green-lit. “Similar to the iPad mini, we expect a concentrated low-cost iPhone rather than a ‘cheap’ one.” He says it will have a polycarbonate case, a 4-inch display and no LTE.
* Even if you consider the fact that analysts aren’t always the most accurate when it comes to Apple rumors, you have to admit, there’s a lot of different analysts saying the same thing right now: the next iPhone will land sooner than expected, and Apple has a low-cost iPhone in the works. And that suggests that Apple is making some major strategic changes this year, which in and of itself is cause for excitement.
