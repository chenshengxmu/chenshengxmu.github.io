* Random events happen throughout the day, sometimes prompting you to jot things down in your Notes app, so you don’t forget them. But wouldn’t it be great if you type notes to yourself without having to unlock your handset?
* Notepad is a new jailbreak tweak by iOS developers NeinZedd9 and AppleBetas that makes this possible. The tweak adds an easily-accessible note-taking interface directly to the Lock screen so you can begin typing notes whenever you need to.
* As shown in the screenshot examples above, Notepad can be used in a variety of ways. Some use cases include:
* Notepad always appears on your Lock screen whether you have a note written to yourself or not. To some, this might seem bothersome, but it makes the tweak readily-accessible. You can see a demo of Notepad in the video below:
* Subscribe to iDB on YouTube
* You can configure Notepad from its preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you can:
* The developers provide a Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane to make it easy to save any changes you make to the settings. That said, be sure to use it after making adjustments.
* Overall, it seems like a great idea for folks that have trouble remembering things or that want the convenience of jotting down notes without unlocking their devices. The tweak offers ample configuration to make most users happy, and the developers are always pushing updated to make it better.
* If you’d like to try Notepad for yourself, then you can download it for $2.99 from Cydia’s Chariz/HASHBANG Productions repository. The tweak supports all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Note: If you aren’t already using the Chariz/HASHBANG Productions repository, then you can use this tutorial and information piece to learn how to add it to Cydia.
