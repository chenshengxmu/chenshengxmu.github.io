* It’s been nearly 24 hours since Apple pushed out 5.0.2 to Apple TV owners, and, at least at the time of this writing, it has still yet to post any details regarding the update. The ATV support page still shows 5.0.1 as the latest software.
* But perhaps the changes in 5.0.2 were so minute that it didn’t warrant any kind of changelog. After all, the folks at FireCore have already managed to update their Seas0nPass jailbreak utility to support the new firmware…
* That’s right, a new version of FireCore has just been released that is compatible with yesterday’s Apple TV update. Owners of second generation ATVs will be able to use the new tool to jailbreak their devices. And yes, it’s still untethered.
* As usual, you can find the latest version of Seas0nPass on our Downloads page. And for those of you that aren’t real familiar with the process, we have tutorials on how to use the utility, and a page full of all of the benefits of doing so.
* Unfortunately, third generation Apple TVs are still not supported, and we don’t see that changing anytime soon.
