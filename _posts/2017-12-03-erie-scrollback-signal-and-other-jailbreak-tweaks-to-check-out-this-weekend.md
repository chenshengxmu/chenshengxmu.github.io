* While there’s been some turbulence in the jailbreak community as of late following the archival of the ModMyi and ZodTTD/MacCiti repositories, the BigBoss repository continues to serve the community by hosting a plethora of new jailbreak tweak releases.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all this past week’s tweak releases. As we do every weekend, we’ll start by showcasing our favorite jailbreak tweaks of the week, and then we’ll outline the rest afterward.

* Erie is a jailbreak tweak that generates haptic feedback whenever you press your device’s hardware buttons.
* Out of the box, Erie supports the Home, sleep, and volume buttons, but can also provide haptic feedback whenever you use the Touch ID sensor to authenticate something.
* As the developer notes, the haptic feedback added to your Home button feels a lot like using the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, albeit slightly different.
* If you like haptic feedback, then Erie might be for you. You can learn more about the tweak from our full review, where we discuss the tweak in-depth.

* ScrollBack is an exceptional jailbreak tweak that lets you get back to your previous spot on a page after accidentally ‘returning to the top’ with the Status Bar tap gesture.
* To get back to your place, all you have to do is tap on the Status Bar a second time immediately after the accidental tap, as illustrated by the animated GIF above.
* Because I do this by accident quite frequently, I firmly believe Apple should put a feature like this in iOS by default, just to make things easier.
* If you’re interested in learning more about ScrollBack and why it’s such an important staple, read our full review.

* The Signal jailbreak tweak is a blast from the past; it lets you customize both your cellular service indicator and carrier name.
* Apart from spoofing your cellular service to make it look like you have more signal strength than you really do, you could also use this tweak to make it look like your Wi-Fi-only iPad or iPod touch has cellular service.
* As a bonus, I’ve always liked being able to change my carrier name, but there aren’t too many free jailbreak tweaks these days that support this function on iOS 10.
* If you’re interested in messing around with your device’s carrier and cellular information, we’d recommend Signal. You can read our full review to learn more about how it works.
