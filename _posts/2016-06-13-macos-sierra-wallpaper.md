* Today, Apple announced major renovations and upgrades to its latest version of OS X, now called macOS. The new naming convention means the operating system falls in line with its brethren, watchOS, iOS, and tvOS. New features prominently include desktop Siri integration and auto unlock features. Check out our full round up from earlier.
* Immediately after the new system was shown, I began getting pings for the new wallpaper via @jim_gresham, where I receive submissions for our Wallpapers of the Week section. Also, if you have any leads on upcoming wallpapers, you know where to find me.
* Thanks to some Twitter friends, you can find versions of the macOS Sierra wallpaper inside. Download them below the fold.
* Thanks to @stijn_d3sign for helping us with a critical 4K extraction and thanks to @Axinen for the smaller desktop version and the iOS device adjustments.

* Download: iPhone; iPad; desktop (2880 x 1800);
* UPDATE: The 4K desktop version is being hosted externally, until the site crashes. There was a previous pixelated version. This is the best we can do for now.
* What do you think about the new macOS features?
