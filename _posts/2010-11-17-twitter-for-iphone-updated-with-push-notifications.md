* The official Twitter app for iPhone and iPad was just updated to support native push notifications for @mentions and direct messages. Push notifications can be enabled in a new pane for your account settings.
* Push notifications for  the Twitter app (and what was formerly Tweetie) has been a highly desired feature for a very long time. I’m sure we’re all glad that Twitter has finally gotten around to implementing a feature that should have been part of the app when it was first released…
* You are given the option to receive notifications from only people you follow, as well as anyone who mentions you. You also get a badge on your Twitter app icon of how many unread notifications you have.
* I’ve enabled push notifications in my Twitter app and it has been working great. Mentions are getting pushed quickly and the icon badges are a great addition for keeping track of unread mentions and messages.
* Update your Twitter app in the App Store to get push notifications and a few other minor updates. Let us know if you’re having problems with the updated app. Some people have complained that there are some bugs.
* I know that some people have kept from using the official Twitter app due to the lack of push notifications. Does this new update make you want to use the app? Do you use a third party push notification service to handle your Twitter mentions already?
