* Why should you jailbreak the iPhone? That’s a question that gets asked here at iDB all the time. If you consider yourself a jailbreak expert, you’ve most likely been asked the same question once or twice.
* There’s perhaps no one man more qualified to answer that question than Jay Freeman, a.k.a. “saurik.” Saurik created Cydia– the hub of the jailbreak world. He is the man responsible for what the jailbreak community has become today.
* At the Mobile Connections conference, Robert Scoble caught up with saurik and Cydia’s “Community and User Experience” manager for a short talk about jailbreaking.
* Saurik gave a brief explanation of what jailbreaking allows you to do on the iPhone, and he also talked about Cydia and some of his favorite tweaks from the Cydia store.
* Some of the tweaks/apps that saurik and Brenda mentioned:
* As noted in the interview, saurik recommends the RedSn0w jailbreak tool. Check out our RedSn0w tutorial to learn how to jailbreak your iPhone.
* When Scoble first asked saurik why you should jailbreak, saurik said that it gives you,”the freedom to do things that are outside of the scope of an application.”
* How would you answer someone if they asked you why to jailbreak? What tweaks or apps would you show off?
