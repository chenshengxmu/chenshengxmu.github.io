* Letâ€™s face it, as jailbreakers we have a lot of stereotypes created about us. Some are undoubtedly true, and some are perhaps a bit more far-fetched. The fact of the matter is that jailbreaking brings its own type of lingo, thinking, and funny moments.
* With this in mind, I came up with 10 jailbreak stereotypes for this tongue-in-cheek video. How many of these jailbreak stereotypes are you guilty of?
* Drop me a comment down below with your thoughts. Are there any that I forgot?
