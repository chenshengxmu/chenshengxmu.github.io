* According to Peter Kafka of AllThingsD, and verified independently by my sources, podcasts in iOS 6 will have a dedicated app come this fall. Though the Podcast section is still present in desktop iTunes 10.6.3, released earlier this week, removing it from iOS 6 iTunes storefront indicates plans that a brand new Podcast app is in the works. Another tell-tale sign: at first run, the iTunes app tells you the iTunes U section has moved to a dedicated app, released back in January. Oh, Audiobooks too are MIA…
* Kafka writes over at the Wall Street Journal-owned AllThingsD blog:
* People familiar with Apple’s plans tell me that when its new iOS 6 software becomes widely available this fall, podcasts will have their own app, where users will be able to discover, download and play them on mobile devices.
* Users who access iTunes via laptop and desktop machines will still find them in that version of iTunes, though.
* AppAdvice was first to notice this change two days ago. As you can see in a comparison below of the iTunes Store storefront app in iOS 5 and iOS 6, the Podcast section indeed is now a goner.

* In addition to pulling the Podcast section (podcasts debuted on the iTunes Store with iTunes 4.9 release in mid-2005), plus Audiobooks and iTunes U from the mobile iTunes app, it’s worth pointing out that last year’s release of iOS 5 broke up the iPod app into separate Video and Music programs.
* And with iBooks also being a separate app, it’s increasingly looking that the company will break up iTunes media categories into separate apps.
* Kafka speculates:
* So the move to push podcasts completely into their own space may signal an effort to put iTunes on diet, something many Apple fans have asked for.
* Whether or not the existing iTunes U app and rumored Audiobooks and Podcasts programs will ship with the iOS 6 operating system or be provided as optional downloads (as is the case with iBooks) remains to be seen.
* We’ll find out in fall, when Apple promised to release iOS 6 to the public.
* Would you rather prefer a ‘one app fits all’ approach to handling iTunes media in iOS 6?
