* Apple’s next smartphone refresh may or may not bring a major design overhaul to the iPhone that fans have been holding their breath for, but we still fully expect the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be worthwhile upgrades in terms of both the looks and the features.
* The rumor-mill does think, however, the device could have a cleaner look and feel due to the antenna lines being relocated to the very top and bottom.
* The rear camera is said to protrude less from the housing and have a bevelled look and we might even get a pair of grilles at the bottom for stereo speakers. Taking it all in, Dutch 3D artist Jermaine Smit has imagined the iPhone 7 Plus in a concept video.
* And here it is.
* I’m liking his implementation of the Lock screen widgets!
* If Apple’s history of innovation is indicative of its future moves, the next iPhone should boost your mobile photography with improved low-light performance and better light sensitivity.
* Check out another concept video from the same artist, this one from three months ago.
* Apple bought Israeli imaging firm LinX which patented some curious photography solutions, based on dual cameras. Were Apple to implement LinX technology into the next iPhone, we might be treated to  RAW image capture, the ability to adjust focus after the photograph has been taken and other photography goodies.
* What do you think of these concept videos and what iPhone 7 features are you looking forward to the most? I’m very much curious about those dual cameras.
