* Welcome to the inaugural episode of the question and answer video feature, Ask Jeff.
* Here is where I will do my best to answer at least five questions each episode that you, the readers and viewers, ask.
* Most of the questions that I select to talk about on air will be iOS related questions, but feel free to ask my anything about tech in general, and we’ll see if I can squeeze in a few auxiliary questions per episode.
* So, without further delay, the first episode of Ask Jeff…
* Questions answered revolve around SBSettings themes, live clock and live weather, safari downloads, and tidy status bars.
* If you want your question featured in episode 02, leave your comment below, or on the video’s YouTube page.
* So, who’s got a question?
