* We’ve managed to get our hands on the new iPad ahead of tomorrow’s official launch, and we’re taking advantage of it by publishing a wide range of hands-on videos and comparison tests with its predecessor.
* Next up in our head-to-head matchup is the new iPad’s Retina display vs. the screen of the iPad 2. Since the biggest selling point of the new tablet is obviously its screen, we wanted to see if it lived up to the hype…
* Notice how you can barely make out any pixels on the new iPad even with the screen magnified many times over? Now look at the iPad 2. The difference, though predictable, is stunning when you compare the two devices side-by-side.
* So the big question on everyone’s minds seems to be: “is the heralded Retina display worth the upgrade to the new iPad over the iPad 2?” Well if this video is anything to go by, then the answer is a resounding yes.
* What do you think? Is the Retina display worth the upgrade alone?
