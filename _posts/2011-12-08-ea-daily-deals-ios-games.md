* With Christmas just two weeks away, developers are undoubtedly going to start rolling out their app specials soon. It’s the holidays, and just as publishers hosted major app sales over Thanksgiving week, we expect to see tons of deals this month.
* EA, or Electronic Arts rather, was at the forefront of the discounting in November, shaving up to 80% off of some of its most popular titles. And apparently it has even bigger plans in store for December, as the company has setup a dedicated Daily Deals site…
* The website highlights some of EA’s best discounts for its iPhone and iPad games. The page looks like it’s refreshed everyday at 9AM PST, but here are some of its current listings:
* TETRIS for iPhone $0.99
* Dead Space for iPad 50% Off
* High Caliber Hunting for iPhone Free
* Risk for iPad 55% Off
* Risk for iPhone $0.99
* Surviving High School for iPhone Free
* Along with the discounted games, EA is also knocking 30% off of in-app purchases. We’re not sure how long the promotion is going to last, but we assume it’ll be available through the end of December.
* It’s safe to say that if you were thinking about purchasing a game in the near future, you might want to hold off and see if it goes on sale this month. As always, keep checking iDB for the latest in app deals and discounts.
