* DJI has given a major upgrade to their popular Osmo Mobile gimbal, fixing many (if not all) of the pain points from the first generation. We went hands-on to see how it held up.
* The biggest changes for the Osmo Mobile 2 include a new lightweight nylon body, support for portrait mode, rearranged button layouts, significantly longer battery life, and a USB-A output to charge your phone. Probably the biggest change, is the substantial price drop down to only $129.
* Check out our hands-on video to see for yourself how well the upgraded device performed.

* In the 20 minutes I spent playing with the new gimbal, rarely did I have it falter. Only on the quickest and most jarring movements did it give a slight hiccup in the recordings.
* We will have more coverage of the DJI Osmo Mobile 2 when it finally launches early this year. You can preorder exclusively through Apple starting January 23.
* Let us know what you think of DJI’s newest smartphone stabilizer down in the comments.
