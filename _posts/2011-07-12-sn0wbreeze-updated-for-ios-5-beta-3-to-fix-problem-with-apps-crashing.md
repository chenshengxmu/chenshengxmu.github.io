* Apple released iOS 5 Beta 3 yesterday, and it was quickly confirmed that you could jailbreak Apple’s newest beta build with last month’s version of the popular jailbreaking tool, RedSn0w. A “sandboxing” error was discovered after jailbreak iOS 5 Beta 3 that caused all apps from the App Store to crash instantly upon being opened.
* This problem has now been fixed in the updated version of the Windows jailbreak tool, Sn0wBreeze, and the Dev Team has also updated RedSn0w with the same fix. Happy jailbreaking!
* Sn0wBreeze creator, iH8Sn0w, recently announced Sn0wBreeze v2.8b4 for iOS 5 Beta 3, and the tethered jailbreak will correct the problem with malfunctioning App Store apps that was found in the previous version of RedSn0w.
* Sn0wBreeze v2.8b4 release notes:
* Supported devices:
* Remember, Sn0wBreeze is a Windows-only tool, and iOS 5 Beta 3 is intended for developer use only. You can download the newest version of Sn0wBreeze from our downloads section. Follow our tutorial to see how to jailbreak with the tool.
* As you can tell, the iPad 2 is not supported in either of these jailbreak tools, and JailbreakMe will only jailbreak the iPad 2 on iOS 4.3.3. Don’t install an iOS 5 beta on your iPad 2 expecting to jailbreak.
* Let us know how the updated versions of SnowBreeze and RedSn0w work for you when jailbreaking iOS 5 Beta 3.
