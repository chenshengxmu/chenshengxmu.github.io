* A new handy feature that made its way to iOS 5 is the ability to launch the camera directly from the lockscreen. Have you ever wanted to take a picture rapidly but missed the perfect shot because it took you too long to unlock your phone and launch the camera app? No more of that.
* Now you can launch the camera app more quickly by simply hitting the home button twice while on the lockscreen. This will bring the camera icon. Hitting this icon will launch the camera appâ€¦
* Additionally, you can now use the volume buttons to snap a picture. Really convenient too.
* What do you think of this feature?
