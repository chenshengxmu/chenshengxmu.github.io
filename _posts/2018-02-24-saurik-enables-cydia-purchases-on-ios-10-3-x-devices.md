* On Saturday, Saurik flipped the switch for making purchases through Cydia on jailbroken iOS 10.3.x devices.
* The change lets anyone jailbroken by way of sticktron’s G0blin tool to purchase paid jailbreak tweaks and themes from the Cydia Store. Before today, this was only possible on jailbroken devices running iOS 10.2 and earlier with Yalu.
* Saurik generally enables purchases on newly-jailbroken firmware once it’s proven stable enough. That said, one can now officially consider the G0blin jailbreak ‘as stable as it gets’ in its current form.
* Notably, not all jailbreak tweaks and extensions have been updated with support for iOS 10.3.x, so this is something to keep in mind before breaking out the wallet to download mods on your device. As Sticktron adds, jailbreakers on iOS 10.3.x should give developers more time to update their packages:

* As many would agree, it’s a step in the right direction for the jailbreak community. Then again, many are still anticipating Saurik’s official iOS 11 updates for both Cydia and Mobile Substrate. There’s no official ETA for them at this point in time.
* If you’ve jailbroken your iOS 10.3.x device(s) with G0blin, are you happy to see Cydia cutting the tape for purchases? Share in the comments section below.
