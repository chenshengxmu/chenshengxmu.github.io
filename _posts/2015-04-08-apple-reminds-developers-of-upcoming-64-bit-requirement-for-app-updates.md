title: Apple reminds developers of upcoming 64-bit requirement for app updates
---
* As a reminder to developer, Apple published on its developer portal today that starting June 1, 2015, all app updates submitted to the App Store will have to include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. While the move probably won’t affect active developers who are already in compliance, smaller developer who haven’t updated their apps for iOS 8 or 64-bit devices yet will have some catching up to do, and it’s only good for us users.

* As a reminder, beginning June 1, 2015 app updates submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code. For more information, read the 64-Bit Transition Guide for Cocoa Touch.
