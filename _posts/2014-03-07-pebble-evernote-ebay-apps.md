* Last month, Pebble launched its dedicated smartwatch app store with over 1,000 apps and watch faces. Few of the apps were noteworthy, but the company promised that it was working on landing titles from high profile developers.
* And today it made good on that promise, as its launched 3 new smartwatch apps from well-known tech giants. Pebble owners can now access their eBay and Evernote accounts, as well as their TWC equipment, right from their wrists…

* The new Evernote app allows you to sync up with your account and view notes, shortcuts, tags, check lists, and reminders. You can even tick off items in your check lists using the Pebble, and the data will seamlessly sync back to Evernote.

* The eBay app gives users direct access to their eBay Feeds, allowing them to discover new items and add them to their Watch lists. And the Time Warner app acts as a remote for Intelligent Home users to control their thermostat, lights, and more.

* Looking for other apps from major companies? Well both Yelp and Foursquare were Pebble Shop launch partners, and Mercedes Benz recently added a new app called ‘Digital DriveStyle’ that offers Benz-owners live vehicle and traffic information.
* Pebble also launched its app store for Android users today, noting that it took “a bit longer than expected” in order to ensure that the platform was up to par. If you’re a Pebble smartwatch owner, you can find the iPhone app and app store here.
