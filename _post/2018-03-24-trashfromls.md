* Depending on your iPhone’s notification settings, you might receive email notifications on the Lock screen as the flow of messages come in. While it can be convenient to see these email previews, it’s somewhat annoying that you can’t delete incoming emails from the Lock screen without authenticating yourself first.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called TrashFromLS by iOS developer Kiran Patil was just released in Cydia this week and tackles this problem head-on. After installing it, you can move incoming emails to the trash without authenticating yourself.
* In case you have no idea what we’re talking about, the illustration above shows what happens when you attempt to access the “Trash” feature for an incoming email via 3D Touch. iOS quickly asks for you to authenticate yourself with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode (whichever pertains to you) before you can move forward.
* After you install TrashFromLS, you can use a 3D Touch gesture on incoming email notifications without authenticating yourself, and you’ll gain access to the menu shown below:

* With the “Trash” option now more readily accessible, you can move unwanted spam emails to the Trash in fewer steps. If you get a lot of emails throughout the day like I do, then this tweak could potentially save you some time day in and day out.
* On the other hand, the tweak makes it easier for strangers to pick up your handset when and delete incoming emails when you aren’t looking. Unless you have unethical pranksters in your life, then this probably won’t be a problem. But then again, this small hindrance to security is worth noting.
* The goal behind TrashFromLS is simple, and so it doesn’t come with any options to configure. If you’d like to try TrashFromLS out for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Does TrashFromLS sound like a nifty idea to you? Let us know in the comments section below!
