* In general, App Store updates are a good thing; it shows that the developers are continuing to support their apps, squashing bugs, etc.
* But if you have tons of App Store apps like I do, the constant updates can be more of an annoyance. What to do?
* If your device is jailbroken and running iOS 5, check out Update Hider for iOS 5.
* Update Hider makes it extremely easy to hide updates from appearing in the App Store. It relieves you of the stress of having to stare at the app update badges on your App Store app.
* Even better, it only blocks out the current update for any particular app, so that if a new updates comes out after you hide the previous one, you will still be notified.
* The update hiding can easily be disabled by means of the Settings app as well, so don’t fret, you can always restore your updates when you want to deal with them.
* Update Hider for iOS 5 is available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. I certainly recommend it for those with tons of apps, what about you?
