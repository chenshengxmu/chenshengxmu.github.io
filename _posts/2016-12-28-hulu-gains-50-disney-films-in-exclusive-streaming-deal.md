* Subscription video on demand service Hulu just announced an exclusive multi-year deal with the entertainment conglomerate Disney that gives it rights to stream a collection of hit movies and family favorites from the rich library of blockbuster films from The Walt Disney Studios. This means that Disney movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Mulan, Pocahontas, Hercules, Sister Act and Air Bud are all now available to stream exclusively via Hulu.
* As part of the agreement, more than 50 popular Disney titles will be available to stream on Hulu for the first time, including movies like Con Air, Step Up, Gone in 60 Seconds, Pearl Harbor, Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion and The Mighty Ducks, in addition to Disney’s famous blockbusters such as Lilo & Stitch, Tarzan, The Emperor’s New Groove, Muppet Treasure Island and The Princess and the Frog.
* These titles will become available on Hulu over the coming months.
* Hulu is said to be working on a digital pay-TV service that should launch some time in 2017. In August 2016, Time Warner acquired a ten percent stake in Hulu.
* Hulu’s video service is available for $7.99 per month with ads. The company offers a higher-priced $11.99 per month tier for those who wish to get rid of advertising.
