* If you’re one of those people that knows what U+F8FF means, or what Option+Shift+K does, then this post is for you. For those of you who aren’t aware, U+F8FF is the Unicode address for the Apple logo  (on Apple devices) that you see on a lot of Twitter profiles, etc.
* PictoKeyboard is a new tweak that allows you to have a Unicode keyboard on your iDevice, making it easy to access your favorite symbols on the small screen…
* PictoKeyboard works by temporarily replacing an unused international keyboard (Croatian, for example) with the Unicode keyboard.
* It’s basically like having a bunch of new Emoji icons at your fingertips.
* If you’re looking for an added way to express your thoughts and feelings via text, then PictoKeyboard is a good choice. It works on all jailbroken iOS 5 devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
* What do you think? 
