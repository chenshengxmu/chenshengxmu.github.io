* Good news for all of you would be Mailbox users: the app no longer requires to you to wait an inordinate amount of time before gaining access to it. That’s because Mailbox has dropped its reservation system, an idea initially brought forth to stagger the amount of users placing stress on its network at any one time.
* Along with the recent 1.2 update, which brought smarter snooze options and a helping of UI tweaks to the fore, Mailbox can actually be used immediately after downloading it. How’s that for practicality?
* Ah, no reservation nonsense.

* Per Mailbox’s blog:
* Good news! Mailbox is now available without having to wait in line. After 10 weeks of around-the-clock hard work, our engineering team has scaled the Mailbox service to deliver over 100 million messages per day (and growing). We believe we can now confidently handle new users as they sign up, so we’ve pulled down the reservation system.
* So there you have it, Mailbox now believes it can handle new user signups without any hiccups. That’s likely the result of the passing of the initial surge of hype and demand, along with being recently acquired by Dropbox. Probably more of the latter.
* You may have skipped our review of Mailbox initially, out of disdain for the inability to use the service. If so, scoot over there right now, and check out our full video and written review, before downloading. Mailbox is available free of charge on the App Store. iPad version, please.
