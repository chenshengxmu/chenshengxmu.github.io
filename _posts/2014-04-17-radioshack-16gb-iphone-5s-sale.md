* Folks still in the market for an iPhone 5s may be interested to know that RadioShack will soon be offering a significant discount on the handset. Starting tomorrow, the nationwide retailer will begin selling the 16GB model of the 5s for just $99.99 in-store with a qualifying 2-year contract.
* That’s $100 cheaper than most carriers and third party sellers have the entry-level iPhone 5s priced at, and is among one of the best deals we’ve seen on the smartphone. Additionally, RadioShack says it’s offering a $100 credit for folks trading in an eligible iPhone 4s, making the 5s free…
* Again, you’ll need to sign a 2-year agreement with Verizon, Sprint or AT&T to qualify for the promotion, and it looks like it’s going to only be available in-store. There’s also no word yet on how long the deal will run for, but RadioShack tells us that it will post more details tomorrow.
* Keep in mind that although the iPhone 5s is Apple’s current late-model smartphone, another one is expected to be released within the next 3-4 months. The so-called iPhone 6 is believed to feature a larger, higher-resolution display, better camera and various other performance improvements.
