title: Consumer Reports- We Can't Recommend the iPhone 4
---
* We knew the iPhone 4 had some serious antenna issues. The reason? We’re holding it wrong, or at least that’s what Apple is telling us.

* After carrying out several tests, Consumer Reports actually think the problem doesn’t come from the way we’re holding the phone but from the phone itself.
* Our findings call into question the recent claim by Apple that the iPhone 4’s signal-strength issues were largely an optical illusion caused by faulty software that “mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength.”
* The tests also indicate that AT&T’s network might not be the primary suspect in the iPhone 4’s much-reported signal woes.
* So apparently, the problem is indeed related to the hardware and not to AT&T or even the software, as Apple wants us to believe.
* The signal problem is the reason that we did not cite the iPhone 4 as a “recommended” model, even though its score in our other tests placed it atop the latest Ratings of smart phones that were released today.
* If you want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix, we continue to recommend an older model, the 3G S.
* Although the iPhone 4 is a great device, Consumer Reports can’t recommend it because of the huge antenna flaw.
* As for me, yes the antenna issue really bugs me but if you ask me, I’ll say go for it! Get yourself an iPhone 4. Although I am already at my 3rd iPhone 4, I think it’s the best iDevice I’ve owned so far.
* What do you think?
