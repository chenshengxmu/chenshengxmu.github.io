* A new report seems to confirm previous ones that say Apple’s planning to refresh its entry-level MacBook lineup as early as next month. New iPad Pro models are also expected to debut in the coming weeks, according to DigiTimes. 
* The next-generation MacBook series is likely to use Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake processor. Best of all, the new models could launch at $1,200, or $100 less than last year’s model.
* The inexpensive MacBook is estimated to have a shipment volume of around eight million units in 2018 and is expected to undermine demand for first-tier competitors’ similar devices.
* Like the current lineup, the 2018 MacBook should be available in space gray, silver, and gold. The new, redesigned 12-inch MacBook series launched in 2015. Two refreshes followed in 2016 and 2017.
* Apple already refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup in July; the MacBook Air is also expected to get an update this Fall.
* On the iPad Pro front, DigiTimes sees two new devices launching, a third-generation 12.9-inch model and one measuring 11 inches diagonally that would replace the current 10.5-inch model. After Apple’s fall announcement, the company is likely to have four tablets on the market. Including the new iPad Pros, the lineup will include the 9.7-inch entry-level iPad that launched earlier this year plus the 7.9-inch iPad mini 4 that arrived back in 2015.
* The two new iPad Pros will come with a newly-designed 18W power adapter featuring USB Type-C interface for a faster charging experience. Apple so far has no further plan for the iPad mini series.
* This year’s iPad Pro lineup is expected to feature a significant design refresh. Besides introducing rounded corners and a smaller body, the new tablets are likely to include Face ID and a True-depth camera system. Neither model is expected to have a Home button or Touch ID.
* Digitimes also confirmed various reports that say Apple’s prepping three new iPhones for the year. It also notes the long-delayed AirPower charging mat should make its debut next month.
* In addition to the new inexpensive notebook, the US-based vendor is also expected to unveil three new iPhones: one featuring a 5.8-inch OLED display, one with a 6.5-inch OLED display and one with a 6.1-inch LCD display in September. The 6.1-inch LCD model is expected to be the most price-friendly and the mainstream device.
* Apple is also expected to announce the launch schedule for its wireless charger AirPower for new iPhones during the conference with a price point at around NT$5,000-6,000 (US$161-193).
* Apple’s almost certainly going to announce a September hardware launch event in the coming days. That event could happen as early as Sept. 12. Besides the new hardware mentioned above, the company is also expected to launch a newly designed Apple Watch and announce updates to the iMac and Mac mini lineup.
