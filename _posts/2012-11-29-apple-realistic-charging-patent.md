* Apple has filed for a patent to solve one of mankind’s most troubling questions: how do I recharge my iPad with this annoyingly-short power cord? In the application, the company suggests a ‘realistic’ way to wirelessly recharge your iDevice via near-field resonance. While near-field technology is more often used to grab data off your credit card at the grocery store, Apple sees the technology as a way to cut the cord between your laptop, iPad or iPhone and a wall charger, the way your mouse was set free years prior…
* “In this way, a realistic and practical approach to wireless transferring usable amounts of power over distances suitable for limited applications can be realized,” Apple writes in the application entitled “Wireless Power Utilization in a Local Computing Environment” and first reported by AppleInsider.
* Apple calls the current method of plugging a charger into a wall socket “unwieldy”.

* A side-benefit of using a near-field system is that any other devices within the area could also take advantage of the power transmission, creating what Apple calls a “virtual charging area”.
* The recharger, according to the publication, would be similar to how third-party wireless devices transmit connections to a mouse or keyboard. The main difference is what Apple’s technology would wirelessly transmit both both the device’s data connection as well as its power.
* It’s unclear whether you could actually wirelessly recharge your iPhone or iPad, or be limited to smaller accessories. In the patent application, Apple lists a mouse or keyboard as potential users of the recharger.
* Would you like to have an Apple-provided wireless charging solution for the iPhone?
