* Great news for those of you who own 3rd generation iPods and/or the iPhone 3GS — both devices have gained support for pod2g’s upcoming untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1.
* The reason these devices were initially excluded was because the kernel vulnerability used to accomplish the jailbreak on other devices didn’t appear to work on the iPod 3G and the iPhone 3GS.
* Although the hacker hasn’t provided more details on how he was eventually able to verify that the jailbreak will be possible, he says he will update us with more details later.
* Check inside for the updated list of devices that will be compatible for the 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak…
