* The Sn0wBreeze jailbreak tool for Windows has been updated with support for the Verizon iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.7. iH8Sn0w has updated Sn0wBreeze with a new payload for an untethered jailbreak on the latest version of iOS for the Verizon iPhone.
* If you are a Windows user with a Verizon iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.7, you can now perform an untethered jailbreak with Sn0wBreeze…
* “sn0wbreeze 2.6.1: Verizon love!
* Well, after i0n1c released his untether exploit for 4.3.1, Apple shortly pushed out 4.3.2 AND 4.2.7. i0n1c’s payload was ported over to 4.3.2 in a short period of time but not 4.2.7. This made Verizon users very frustrated.
* I originally ordered a Verizon iPhone 4 for my upcoming SHSH blobs dumper. Then I + many others on twitter realized that an untether was not available for 4.2.7. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been sick and didn’t do much, but today I was finally able to get the strength to work on this Verizon untether. Since i0n1c’s payload is not easily reversible, I went to previous exploits.
* After trying, pod2g’s + posixninja’s kernel exploit for 4.2.x is STILL in 4.2.7! After some more work, I managed to get this thing untethered!
* So, this new release includes that new payload to untether + jailbreak 4.2.7.”
* You can download the latest version of Sn0wBreeze from our iPhone downloads section. The 4.2.7 firmware for the Verizon iPhone can also be found there.
* If you’re wondering how to jailbreak the Verizon iPhone with Sn0wBreeze, refer to our previous tutorial for jailbreaking with Sn0wBreeze. The steps remain the same (expect for 4.2.7 IPSW instead of 4.3.1).
* Let us know if you end up jailbreaking your Verizon iPhone with Sn0wBreeze. How did it go?
