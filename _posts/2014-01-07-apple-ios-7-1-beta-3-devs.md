* Apple has released the third beta of iOS 7.1 to registered developers this morning. The update, which carries the build number 11d5127c, can be downloaded via Apple’s developer center.
* Today’s release comes just under a month after the second beta, which brought about only a handful of changes like bringing the Touch ID and Passcode menu to the front of the Settings app…
* The beta is available for compatible iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models. We’re installing it ourselves, and will be reporting back with any new stuff we find. So make sure you stay tuned.
* And as always, we welcome you to let us know if you find anything that we may have missed by either e-mailing us at tips@idownloadblog.com, or leaving us a comment on the change below.
* As we continue to dig through the new information in iOS 7.1 beta 3, we’ll be listing any major changes we find below:
* Tweaked keyboard with new Shift/Backspace key highlights:
