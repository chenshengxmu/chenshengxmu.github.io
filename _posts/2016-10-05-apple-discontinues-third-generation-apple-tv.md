* The third-generation Apple TV debuted in March 2012 with a single-core A5 processor and 1080p video output, but now the device is being discontinued as Apple sharpens focus on the latest fourth-generation Apple TV that runs third-party apps and games via the tvOS App Store and comes with a more powerful hardware and the Siri Remote.
* According to 9to5Mac, Apple has removed the device from its online store and confirmed in an email sent out to employees and education partners that it’s phased out the device.
* “Effective immediately, Apple TV (3rd generation), MD/199LL/A, has reached end of life and is now discontinued,” reads Apple’s email. “The Apple Supply team is going to fulfill all shippable backlog.”

* They’re still selling refurbished Apple TV 3 models for $59.
* I still have my third-generation Apple TV lying around somewhere and won’t be selling it anytime soon. Although I’ve never flashed it to install unsanctioned apps, it’s still a great pay TV device and a Netflix machine—especially at its former $69 asking price.
* As Apple no longer has an inexpensive streamer in its Apple TV lineup (the fourth-generation Apple TV starts out at $149), maybe the current model will occupy the $69 price point once a next-generation model is released?
* Speaking of which, do you think the Apple TV will get a hardware refresh this year?
