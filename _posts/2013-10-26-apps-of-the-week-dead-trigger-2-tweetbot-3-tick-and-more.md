* This amazing app by Propellerhead has been around for over a year now. However, it’s always been $0.99. This week, you can get your hands on the music creation app for free. Make songs by tapping instruments using drums, bass, and synthesizer. Slide your finger across the screen to manipulate the sound, tempo, and octaves. This app is great for seasoned musicians and musical noobs alike. It is simple to adjust the digital instruments to your liking without needing any kind of musical background. However, musicians will know how cool it is that Thor and Kong power these instruments to bring a realistic sound to a fun little app. This app is available for free.
