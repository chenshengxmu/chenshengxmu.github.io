* During its CES keynote on Tuesday, Samsung announced that iOS compatibility is coming soon to its Gear S2 smartwatch. On stage at the Las Vegas event, the company’s VP Alanna Cotton said that the popular Tizen-powered accessory is getting iPhone support later this year.
* Cotton didn’t offer up specific dates or details, but expect S2 functionality to be far more limited on iOS than it is on Android. Apple does not give developers the kind of low-level access its own Watch enjoys—something that has long-hampered Pebble and Android Wear devices.
* Nevertheless, the Gear S2 has received praise for its round design and intuitive rotating bezel interface, so I imagine it will still find an audience among iPhone users. Samsung also used its time on the CES stage to introduce new rose gold and platinum colorways for the smartwatch.
* For those who missed the announcement in September, the Gear S2 is Samsung’s newest wearable. It features a 1.2-inch 360×360 Super AMOLED display, NFC, heart rate and barometer sensors, and as I mentioned above, it runs Samsung’s Tizen operating system—not Android Wear.
