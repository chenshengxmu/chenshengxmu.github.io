* You may soon be able to snooze specific keywords in your Facebook News Feed for 30 days.
* HIGHLIGHTS:
* The feature is presently being tested with a subset of Facebook users.
* The social network has supported snoozing people as a way of decluttering the News Feed since December 2017, and now they’re testing a new keyword snooze capability for News Feeds, pages and groups. The option labeled “Snooze keywords in this post” is readily available through the three-dotted menu in each posts’s top-right corner.

* You can snooze one or multiple keywords, but not ads.
* Facebook explains:
* Located in a post’s upper right-hand menu, the feature gives people the option to temporarily hide posts by keywords, which are pulled directly from text in that post.
* If you choose to snooze a keyword, you won’t see posts in your News Feed containing that exact word or phrase from any person, Page or Group for 30 days.
* In other words, fewer spoilers.
* Snoozing a keyword removes posts from your News Feed containing that word.

* TechCrunch explains how this feature may help prevent World Cup-related spoilers.
* Tapping that menu reveals a list of nouns from the post you might want to nix, without common words like ‘the’ in the way. So if you used the feature on a post that said ‘England won its World Cup game against Tunisia! Yes!’, the feature would pull out ‘World Cup’, ‘England’ and ‘Tunisia’.
* Select all that you want to snooze, and posts containing them will be hidden for a month. Currently, the feature only works on text, not images, and won’t suggest synonyms you might want to snooze as well.
* A Facebook spokesperson said they will consider expanding the 30-day limit “if we’re hearing from people that they want more or less time.”
* I’m liking the idea of keyword-based snoozing for my News Feed.
* Don’t you hate it when you stumble upon a spoiler in your News Feed before you’ve watched the last episode of the season? I can’t remember the number of times I’ve had one of my Facebook friends reveal the ending of a movie sequel I was planning on watching.
* It’s presently unclear whether or not keyword-based snoozing will help prevent future heartaches like these, or if it’s simple enough to use to catch on with customers, but it’s a good place to start. According to the company, a small percentage of users may see the keyword snooze button ahead of a wider rollout in the coming weeks.
