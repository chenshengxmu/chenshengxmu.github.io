* Well, that was a wee bit quicker than we expected, but Apple has released iOS 4.3.3 to the public.
* Although the update was initially said to be released sometime in the next few weeks (it was about a week ago when they stated this), it looks like Apple has finished testing and has opted to release iOS 4.3.3 ahead of schedule.
* Why the rush to release such an minor update? It’s just a sneaking suspicion, but it might have something to do with the bad press that Apple’s been receiving as of late due to a certain location tracking bug…
* This firmware update is for the iPhone 4 (GSM only), 3GS, iPad 2, iPad, iPod touch 3rd and 4th gen. The Verizon CDMA iPhone received a similar update in the form of iOS 4.2.8.
* The update addresses the location tracking bug that received an insane amount of media attention over the past few weeks since it was initially discovered.
* The update will reduce the size of the location cache, prevent it from backing up via iTunes, and remove the cache entirely when location services are disabled.
* As always, jailbreakers are going to want to stay away from this firmware update until further notice. If you’re not worried about jailbreaking, then feel free to head over to our downloads section and have at it.
* Are you happy that Apple has finally fixed the bug?
