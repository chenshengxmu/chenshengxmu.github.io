* Folks wondering how Apple did financially during its quiet third quarter will have their answer in just a few short weeks. The Cupertino company announced this afternoon that it will be releasing its financial results for Q3 2013 on July 23.
* Apple’s earnings reports are typically a major affair in the tech world, and this one won’t likely be much different. The iPad-maker’s stock continues to take a beating, and it desperately needs to post some big numbers to change the conversation…
* But, as we found out in Q2 of this year, it’s going to be hard to impress Wall Street. Apple beat most projections for the three month period, selling 37.4M iPhones, 19.5M iPads, and collected $43.6 billion in revenue, and its stock still dropped 4%.
* And once again, Apple didn’t launch any new mobile products during the quarter, which could definitely affect its bottom line. Tim Cook and company have decided to wait until the fall to update its iPhone, iPads, and anything else it’s been working on.
* At any rate, Apple’s Q3 conference call is slated to begin on Tuesday, July 23 at 2pm PST. And as usual, we will be providing full coverage of the call, including financial results and any other announcements or notable highlights. So make sure to tune in.
