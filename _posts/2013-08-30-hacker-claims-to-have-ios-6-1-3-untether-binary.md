* With iOS 7 on the horizon, many rumblings have been surfacing lately about the possibility of an iOS 6.1.3 jailbreak. First there was UnthreadedJB, who after releasing an obscure iOS 5.1 jailbreak for CDMA enable iPhone 4’s, claims to have an iOS 6.1.3 jailbreak. Those claims have never been solidified by any independent sources, so the verdict is definitely still out about its legitimacy.
* But there’s still hope. iOS hacker winocm, well known throughout the jailbreak community, took to twitter this morning to confirm that he has a binary for an iOS 6.1.3 untethered jailbreak.

* According to @winocm’s tweet, the basics are there for an iOS 6.1.3 untethered jailbreak. While he acknowledges that it still “needs some more work” this is probably the best hope we have for a real jailbreak for iOS 6.1.3.
* What relationship this revelation may have with the ongoing efforts by UnthreadedJB, if any, are still unknown. It is interesting, however, that these claims are coming out so late in iOS 6’s life cycle.
* What do you think? Will we eventually see an iOS 6.1.3 jailbreak? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
