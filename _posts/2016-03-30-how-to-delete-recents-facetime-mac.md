* I use FaceTime on a regular basis to place cellular iPhone phone calls through my Mac and engage in immersive video calls with friends and family.
* Each and every missed, placed, received and declined audio and video FaceTime call is captured on the recent calls list so that you can click an entry to quickly dial that person.
* For privacy reasons, you might want to remove some of the items from your recent calls. In this tutorial, we’re going to lay out two ways of removing traces of any particular FaceTime call while telling you about a cool trick to clear your recent calls list completely.
* Your recent calls appear in the following places:
* FaceTime’s recent calls menu in the Dock is shown below.

* As you can see for yourself, the Dock menu lets you click a call to open FaceTime in order to call that person back. The latest calls are listed below recent calls in the menu.
* Here’s how you can clear the recent calls list in FaceTime.
* You can clear the lists of FaceTime video and audio calls you made, received, missed or declined.
* Entries on the list can be cleared one by one, or you can remove them all at once. Clearing an item removes it from the recent calls list on that device only.
* For instance, deleting a missed call in FaceTime for Mac will not remove the entry from FaceTime’s recent calls list on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* 1) Launch the FaceTime app on your Mac.
* 2) Click the Video or Audio tab.
* 3) Right-click on an entry on the list and select the Remove from Recents option in the pop-up menu.
* If you haven’t set up your mouse to have a right click, go to System Preferences > Mouse > Point & Click tab, and select Secondary Click. This will allow you to do a right click using your mouse.

* Tip: If you own a Mac notebook or a desktop Mac with Apple’s Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse, just swipe any entry on the list to reveal a hidden Delete button.

* This removes that particular entry only from the Audio/Video list you’re currently viewing.
* Clear any item on the recent calls list also removes it from the Notification Center, Reminders and FaceTime’s pop-up menu in the Dock.
* 1) Launch the FaceTime app on your Mac.
* 2) Click the Video or Audio tab.

* 3) Right-click on any name in the call list, and select Remove all Recents in the pop-up menu.
* Note that clearing the call list in one tab will also clear the call list in the other one, so proceed with caution.
