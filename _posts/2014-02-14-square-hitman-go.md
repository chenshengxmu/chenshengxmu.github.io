* Square Enix, the prolific studio behind the Final Fantasy franchise, today released Deadman’s Cross, a new card battle game for the iPhone and iPad. And now another studio, Square Enix Montréal, is set to bring the console-only Hitman franchise to iOS.
* The company has confirmed that it is putting finishing touches on Hitman GO, a turn-based strategy game set in the Hitman universe. Hitman GO promises “diorama-style set pieces”, will focus strongly on strategy planning and is “almost ready for launch”. Jump past the fold for additional tidbits…
* According to a blog post yesterday, as Io-Interactive works on the new Hitman game for consoles, Square Enix Montréal took it upon themselves to finally bring Hitman to mobile.
* When pitched, the team at Io-Interactive absolutely loved the premise behind Hitman GO so the Montréal team went ahead with development of Hitman GO.
* Hitman GO is a turn-based strategy game with beautifully rendered diorama-style set pieces. You will strategically navigate fixed spaces on a grid to avoid enemies and take out your target or infiltrate well-guarded locations.
* You really have to think about each move and all the Hitman tools of the trade you would expect are included; disguises, distractions, sniper rifles and even 47’s iconic Silverballers.
* On paper, the concept sounds like a winner and I’m definitely loving the diorama-style set pieces and artwork style.
* Square wouldn’t commit to a specific release date other than assuring that the game is “almost ready for launch” so expect to learn a little more by way of detail in the coming weeks. They’re currently testing Hitman GO to make sure it’s all working properly “before we launch it globally”.
* Do you like these types of strategy games?
* Are you a fan of Hitman and if so, are you looking forward to Hitman Go.
