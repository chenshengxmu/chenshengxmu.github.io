* Homescreen Settings is the type of innovative tweak that doesn’t come around too often, but when it does, you wonder, what took so long?
* It’s one of those, “well, duh!” tweaks that leave you scratching you head as to why it hasn’t been done before.
* That’s what I love about the jailbreak community, because no matter how far we think the developers have pushed the envelope, they continue to amaze us with their work.
* Homescreen Settings is just that, an amazing tweak, and worth every cent of its $1.99 asking price. It allows you to place any, literally, any settings panel onto your iPhone’s Home screen as a quick and convenient shortcut.
* Not convinced? Check inside and be convinced…
* Being a natural skeptic, I was sure that there had to be a catch somewhere. I was positive that there would be some sort of restriction when it came to adding any settings panel to your Home screen, sort of like trying to cash in your frequent flyer miles.
* But nope, there’s no catch here. You can literally add any settings panel to your Home screen as a shortcut. Upon tapping the shortcut, It’ll open in a folder-esque spline view for easy access to all of your settings, toggles, and whatever else you decide to transplant over.
* So, Jailbreaking is dead, huh? Well this, and other recent tweaks make me think that jailbreaking is as alive as ever.
* Let me know how you feel about Homescreen Settings. Do you think I’m overhyping it, or does it deserve its praise?
