* As noted by The New York Times, Facebook has announced a new standalone application for the iPhone and iPod touch called Facebook Camera. The app is intended to make it easier to take and share photos on the social network.
* Facebook members will be able to use the new software to upload high resolution photos — up to 2048 x 2048, choose from a selection of 15 filters (makes sense), and pipe the images directly into their Facebook photo albums…
* From Facebook’s press release:
* “See friend’s photos all in one place – When you launch the app, you’ll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about. You can swipe to see more of any album or tap to enlarge an individual photo.
* Share multiple photos fast – Now you can quickly share multiple photos all at once instead of having to post one at a time. Just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check-mark on each photo and then hit post. You’ll have a chance to add a caption, say where you were and tag friends before you share.
* It’s also easy to edit photos with new tools like the ability to crop, rotate and add filters to any picture in your camera roll.”
* It’s interesting that there isn’t a single mention of Instagram in the app. But if you recall, Facebook was working on a photo sharing app long before it made the $1 billion acquisition. Will the two apps ever collide?
* If you want to check out Facebook Camera for yourself, it appears that it is now available in the App Store.
* So, Facebook Camera. What do you think?
