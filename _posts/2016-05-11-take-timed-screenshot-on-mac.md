* Chances are, you’re probably so accustomed to taking screenshots on your Mac with the stroke of a few keyboard keys that you didn’t even know you could take a timed screenshot. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can set your Mac up to take a timed screenshot, which depending on the situation, can be very useful.
* As experienced of a Mac user as I am, I only just learned about this feature and I found it very useful when I discovered it.
* I was trying to take a screenshot for an earlier tutorial that I wrote, and it was one of those situations where you have to hold down the Option key to reveal a hidden menu.
* The only problem was, I wanted to take a screenshot of the hidden menu and I couldn’t because OS X wouldn’t let me hold the Option key and take a screenshot at the same time; as soon as I would let go of the Option key, the hidden menu disappeared.
* The other alternative I found was to take a timed screenshot, which would let me set up a 10-second timer and then perform the keystroke to reveal a hidden menu for one of the steps in one of my tutorials.
* From there, all I had to do was wait for the Mac to take the screenshot on its own while the hidden menu was showing.
* To take a timed screenshot, you have to use a little-known stock utility known as Grab. To use it to take a timed screenshot, you’ll follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Grab app from the Applications > Utilities folder on your Mac.

* 2) From the Menu Bar, navigate to Capture > Timed Screen. Alternatively, you can press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + Z on your keyboard.

* 3) Next, a pop-up window will appear that asks you if you want to take a timed screenshot after 10 seconds. Click on the blue Start Timer button.

* 4) As you wait, the clock in the window’s icon will fill red slowly. When it becomes fully red, the timer is up.

* Note: During the period of waiting, you are free to do anything you wish, including holding down the Option key to reveal hidden menus.
* 5) After the timer is up, a screenshot of your entire screen will be taken and you’ll then be able to save it anywhere you’d like.
* Congratulations! You’ve just taken a timed screenshot.
* The ability to take a timed screenshot is one that I found incredibly useful for my needs, but it’s obviously a very niche feature that not everybody is going to need.
* Nevertheless, it’s a good trick to know. It’s something Apple includes in their OS X operating system that is very much under-used because hardly anyone actually knows about it.
