* Even though iDB is primarily an iPhone-focused blog, we like to keep tabs on what the competition is up to. Earlier this week we told you about RIM’s all-new BlackBerry 10 platform, and today we’ve got some news regarding Samsung’s latest handset.
* The Korean manufacturer unveiled the Galaxy S III earlier today at a media event in London. Packed with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED display and a host of other high-end components, the device certainly looks impressive on paper. But is it?
* That may depend on which version of the handset is available in your area. While the global variant of the Galaxy S III will be equipped with the new Exynos 4 Quad quad-core processor, regional models will likely include dual-core alternatives.
* But Samsung didn’t just give its Galaxy S line a hardware makeover, it also added in a ton of new software features as well. Some of them are actually pretty impressive, like the new Pop up play feature, which essentially gives you on-device picture-in-picture.
* Then there are some features that some might say aren’t so innovative, like the new Siri-like digital assistant “S Voice.” And the new AirPlay-like “AllShare.” Samsung even introduced Scan and Match, a new service that scans your music collection and automatically uploads it to the cloud. Interesting.
* Initial impressions seem to depict the device as just an incremental update to the current Galaxy S II handset, but we won’t know how it performs in real life until it hits the market next month. One thing is for sure though, Samsung’s bound to sell a ton of them.
* What do you think of the Galaxy S III?
