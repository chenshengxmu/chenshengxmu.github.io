* As precious as your iPhone is, you still love to use it naked… not that you’re naked, I mean case-less. Using an iPhone the way Steve wanted you to tends to leave a concern for scratching and flaking anodized aluminum, which several iPhone 5 users have noticed. When tossing an iPhone in a backpack, duffle bag, or purse, there is always potential for scratching. Consequently, I prefer to use luggage or packs with dedicated gadget pockets that are lined with protective fabrics, but that is not always an option. ColcaSac is here to help case-less iPhone users with their hand sewn organic, hemp sleeves and we’re here to give away 5 of them…
* The company prides itself for using smart materials and healthy products to provide minimalist design. The organic hemp is easily degradable and provides a warmer experience than neoprene or plastic. The outside of the sleeve is similar to a burlap coffee bag, but much softer thanks to the natural hemp. Inside a thick, soft cotton cradles the iPhone for protection.
* Each ColcaSac product is hand cut and sewn, which means individual attention is given to each sleeve. However, this individual process also produces unique nuances to each piece. A sleeve of this type does not require factory made exact precision and I like that each sleeve is its own build. In my Uintah iPhone 5 sleeve, the iPhone fits perfectly inside, exactly as I expected and is not buried in the case, allowing easy access to the Lightening connector and headphone jack.
* Without a phone in the sleeve it still measures approximately just over one inch. This is my sticking point. The sleeve is well made, handcrafted, and unique but I find it to be too thick. It is not going to nicely fit in a front or even back pants pocket. I wouldn’t even want to carry the sleeve in a coat pocket. If I were a cargo pants kind of guy, I may carry one because it will certainly fit in a cargo pocket. Where I actually see myself using a ColcaSac is in a backpack or bag that does not have specific lined pockets for digital gadgets.
* The ColcaSac iPhone sleeve line comes in various styles and materials, only setting you back $15. It is a great natural way to protect an iPhone, but not the easiest sleeve to hide in a pants pocket. However, it is a great addition to your favorite pack, or purse for the ladies. Thanks to the ColcaSac team for sending one over and for taking time to handcraft all of their products. In a world of machines and mass production, it is refreshing there are still a few companies creating their product the old fashioned way – by hand.
