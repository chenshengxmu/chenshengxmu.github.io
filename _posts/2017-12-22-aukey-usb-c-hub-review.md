* I love the new MacBook Pro, and while I’ve converted most of my gear to USB-C, there are still times when a hub is necessary. No more than when I am on the go and someone throws me a hard drive or camera to connect, and I’m left with no appropriate ports. Even worse, when I need to connect an HDMI cable. The Aukey USB-C hub is an affordable, simple tool to keep in your gear bag for these situations.

* It is nothing more than a small USB-C hub with a built in USB-C cable.

* It has a few ports on it including 4 USB-A, HDMI, and an additional USB-C that offers passthrough charging. The basics of what you could need on the go for your MacBook or MacBook Pro.
* It works just fine, though I may argue it should have an Ethernet port on it to be a better mobile solution. Depending on where you are going, wired Internet may be your only option.
* I like that they had the USB-C cable built in, that way you don’t need to worry about bringing on, or losing the one you have.

* Like I’ve said on nearly every USB-C dock or hub review, I wish there was more USB-C ports. That is where we are going, and it would really be awesome if I had a MacBook with a solo USB-C port that I could get a couple more as well as a pair of USB-A and HDMI.
* Since I already have a USB-C hard drive and other peripherals, it seems annoying that a hub wouldn’t give me any additional of those ports.
* The Aukey USB-C hub is a fine solution. The plastic build is fine with me since it is mainly going into my gear bag and I like that it feels durable.
* As a summary, here are the pros and cons.
* Pros
* Cons
* Aside from it lacking more USB-C ports, I don’t have many qualms with the few ports that are here. It is basically a minimum of what I need while on the go.
* If you’re rocking a Retina MacBook, or even the newer MacBook Pro, the Aukey USB-C hub is an easy recommendation for expanding your port availability, especially if you are looking for more USB-A ports.
