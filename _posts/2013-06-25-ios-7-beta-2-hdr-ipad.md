* As Cody mentioned yesterday, iPad support is among the headline changes the newly-released iOS 7 Beta 2 has brought to the table. Jeff did a nice video tour of iOS 7 running on an iPad, highlighting key features such as Control Center, Notification Center, App Switcher, Photo Booth and more. In addition to these, the iPad versions of iOS 7 also enables High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography, an advanced imaging technique previously available only on iPhones and iPod touches…
* A new high-dynamic-range (HDR) option can be found in the iOS 7 Camera app on the iPad, as discovered by Zac Hall of 9to5Mac.
* For those unfamiliar with the feature, HDR works by taking three images in a rapid succession – one in standard and the other two in over and under-exposed modes.
* The software then combines the three photographs into a single HDR image in order to bring out details in shadow while providing greater color accuracy and crispness for overexposed areas.

* This is especially useful when shooting darker objects under direct sunlight and in low-light conditions. As you know, Apple launched the HDR feature on the iPhone 4 and iOS 4.1 back in 2010.
* This is the first time HDR imaging has become available on iPads.
* I only occasionally take my snaps with HDR enabled and while the feature may not be such a big deal compared to iPhones, I’m glad Apple has finally brought this to iPads.
* Are you looking forward to HDR photography on your iPad?
