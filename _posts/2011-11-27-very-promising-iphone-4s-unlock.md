* Dev Team frontman and unlock guru MuscleNerd has given an update on a new unlock for the newly-released iPhone 4S. According to MuscleNerd, a “very promising” unlock for the new handset is “in the works.”
* While iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 owners with older basebands have been able to unlock after jailbreaking for awhile now, there’s a whole set of newer basebands waiting for an UltraSn0w update.

* UltraSn0w lets jailbreakers unlock the iPhone for free to use on different carriers, and there hasn’t been a baseband update for quite some time. Currently, UltraSn0w for iOS 5 supports the following basebands on the iPhone 3GS: 4.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, and 06.15.00. The 01.59.00 baseband is also supported on the iPhone 4. There are multiple iPhone 4 basebands that have yet to be unlocked with an UltraSn0w update.
* The Gevey SIM hardware unlock supports the same basebands as UltraSn0w on iOS 5. You must preserve your baseband when jailbreaking (tethered or semitethered) by using either RedSn0w or Sn0wBreeze if you want to keep unlocking.
* Obviously, an unlock for the iPhone 4S will require a jailbreak, and an untethered jailbreak is also in the works for iOS 5. The Chronic Dev Team gave an update late last night on the status of the iOS 5 jailbreak. Hackers are working feverishly to uncover stable exploits, and they want your help.
* MuscleNerd hasn’t given an exact ETA on the UltraSn0w update, but potential unlockers with newer basebands shouldn’t be left out in the cold much longer.
