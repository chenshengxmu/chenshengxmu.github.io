* As we told you, Google will be unveiling a pair of “Made by Google” smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, at a media event later today. Yesterday, British mobile retailer Carphone Warehouse posted a series of slides for the upcoming devices.
* These images give us a solid advance look at some of the features of the upcoming smartphones. In addition, Rabid Rotty just captured on video a Pixel commercial that aired in Canada ahead of the unveiling.
* The slides have revealed some of the features of the upcoming devices, including two sizes, Google’s built-in Assistant and the Google Photos app, improved cameras with better low-light sensitivity and a Smartbust feature, a fingerprint sensor on the back, fast charging via a reversible USB-C charger than can give you up to seven hours of run time with a short 15-minute charge, Live Cases with custom artwork and more.
* The phones include Google’s video-calling app Duo and messaging app Allo and run stock Android experience with an overlay for invoking the Assistant feature.

* According to web reports, Google will no longer market its own phones under the Nexus brand and is instead going to advertise them as Pixel-branded phones, indicating a break from the past six years of flagship Nexus devices.
* And here’s the leaked Google Pixel commercial that aired in Canada.
* The ad links to the google.com/phone webpage that will be updated with information on the new products after today’s even wraps up. The upcoming phones are also teased at the website madeby.google.com.
* We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016.

* Google is said to have designed these phones itself, but the actual hardware is reportedly being built by Taiwanese handset maker HTC. The company will live-stream the event via the below YouTube video.
* The search giant is also expected to launch its Amazon Alexa competitor today, called Google Home, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, a Daydream VR headset and a successor to its OnHub wireless router.
