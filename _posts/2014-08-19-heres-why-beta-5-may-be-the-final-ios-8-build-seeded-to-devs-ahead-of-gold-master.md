* Yesterday’s release of OS X Yosemite Developer Preview 6 with an additional five gorgeous wallpapers and a bunch of refinements has left many eagle-eyed watchers scratching their head over the fact that the assumed iOS 8 Beta 6 wouldn’t materialize.
* Indeed, fast-forward nearly twenty-four hours later and Beta 6 is still nowhere to be seen. Such an anticlimactic turn of events probably means that iOS 8 Beta 5, which was released a fortnight ago, is the final beta build seeded to developers ahead of the so-called Gold Mater release…
* BGR editor Jonathan Geller writes:
* We previously reported that Apple was scheduled to release a new version of iOS 8 to developers and testing partners, the sixth in the release schedule, and we have learned that Apple has in fact done so.
* With the September 9 iPhone 6 announcement approaching fast, Apple has decided against seeding Beta 6 to developers, Geller explains.
* Apple is requiring all carriers to finish testing iOS 8 by September 5, but already nagging issues arose.
* “One of our sources separately tells us that this build was in fact rejected earlier today because of an issue where YouTube did not work in Safari,” wrote the author.
* BGR is not the most credible of sources and Geller has been wrong on multiple occasions lately, but he remains very accurate when it comes to covering carrier-related news and rumors.
* He also provided the following release notes detailing the changes in iOS 8 Beta 6 distributed to carriers:
* OTA Software Update Paths Carrier Builds Not Available User Builds Not Available
* Issues fixed since Seed 5
* Baseband & Telephony
* Continuity
* FaceTime
* GameCenter
* iCloud
* iTunes Store
* Keyboard
* Mail
* Maps
* Messages
* Phone
* Photos
* Push Notifications
* Springboard
* Visual Voicemail
* Interestingly enough, the article mentioned as a side-note that Apple will launch two new iPhones in September, one called ‘iPhone 6’ and the other ostensibly named ‘iPhone 6L’.
* In case you’ve been wondering, a Gold Master release should sport basically the same code — barring any unforseen circumstances — like the final version set to be released for public consumption in September.
