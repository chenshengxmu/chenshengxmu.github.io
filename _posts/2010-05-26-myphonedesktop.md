* myPhoneDesktop is an application from the App Store that lets you send phone numbers, URLs, text, and images from any desktop computer to your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch over the air.
* With myPhoneDesktop, you can send content quickly from your desktop to your iPhone. Whether you want to send a long Google Map URL to a friend, or some text to a business colleague, or a photo to iPhone, myPhoneDesktop makes it easy.
* myPhoneDesktop makes your iPhone an extension of your desktop by making them work seamlessly together. If you can copy it, you can send it to the iPhone. Using the comfort of your Mac or PC full keyboard, you can send SMS messages, notes, or anything you can type. And in moments, it will be on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* On one end, you’ve got your desktop application. From there, you can copy any phone number, text, image or URL and hit “copy” to send it to your iDevice.
* On the other end, you’ve got your iDevice. Simply launch myPhoneDesktop and the content you sent from your desktop computer will magically appear, assuming you are connected to the internet whether on wifi or 3G. From there, you can open, copy, etc…

* myPhoneDesktop can also notify you with push notifications, letting you view the file right away or ignore it to see it later.
* That’s a very simple yet very useful application. I usually send myself emails with text, images or phone numbers really often and it can be a little cumbersome. Now I can send a phone number effortlessly and assign it to a contact or call it directly from my iPhone.
* The desktop app is compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux. They also have a web client that allows you to bypass the whole download thing and lets you send content from any computer equipped with a web browser.
* You can download myPhoneDesktop from the App Store for $1.99. It will work for your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch
