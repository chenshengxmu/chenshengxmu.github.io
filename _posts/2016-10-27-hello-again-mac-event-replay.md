* Folks who missed today’s ‘hello again’ event, or would just like to watch it again, will be happy to hear that Apple has posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. It was actually a fairly short keynote, by Apple’s standards, but they spent most of the 80 minutes introducing and demonstrating the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.
* The video doesn’t appear to be available on Apple’s YouTube channel yet, so we can’t embed it in this post, but for those of you who would like to watch the clip, you can find it on Apple’s website by clicking here. Just make sure that the device you’re using has QuickTime installed, or a compatible media player that supports QuickTime files.
* So, what’d you think of today’s event?
