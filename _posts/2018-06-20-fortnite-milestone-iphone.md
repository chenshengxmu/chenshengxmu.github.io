* Fortnite has already made $100 million on the App Store, just 90 days after its launch. This makes it the second quickest game to reach this milestone behind Clash Royale, according to Sensor Tower.
* First launched on iOS on March 19, Fortnite reached $25 million in Apple platform sales in 30 days, while achieving the $50 million mark 15 days later. Clash Royale made $154 million after just 90 days in the App Store.

* As Sensor Tower explains, these numbers are impressive:
* In reaching this milestone, Epic Games has managed to surpass some of most successful multiplayer mobile titles of the past two years, despite the fact that Fortnite initially launched in invite-only form for two of the 12 weeks it has been available. As the chart below shows, it earned more than 3x as much as Tencent’s massively successful Honor of Kings—known as Arena of Valor in Western markets—did in China during its first 90 days on iOS, despite not being available there itself.
* Considered a co-op sandbox survival game, Fortnite was developed by Epic Games and People Can Fly. The game launched on multiple platforms on July 25, including Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
* Epic announced Fortnite Mobile on iOS in March. At the time, it promised that the mobile port would have the same features, content, and weekly updates as Fortnite Battle Royale for PC, Mac, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
* “We believe this is the future of games. The same game on all platforms. Console quality graphics and action. Play when you want, where you want,” Epic wrote.
* Initially, the iOS version was available by invitation only. It launched to everyone on April 2. A May update added new locations to explore, new rewards to earn, and drag and drop support on the quickbar for quickly organizing inventory items.
* You can download the free-to-play Fortnite on the App Store.
