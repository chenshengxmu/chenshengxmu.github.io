* In addition to its wide range of other application updates today, Apple has posted a new edition of iTunes this afternoon. The update brings the content management software to version 11.1.2 and includes a handful of improvements.
* Easily the biggest change in iTunes 11.1.2 is its support for OS X Mavericks, the big update Apple released today for its desktop operating system. But it also includes new language support and improved performance and stability…
* Note that this isn’t a must-have update, particularly for folks who don’t have a Mac or don’t plan on updating to Mavericks. For those that have updated, though, you’ll probably want to include this in your list of maintenance tasks today.
* Here are the release notes:

* You’ll notice that Apple has also released a new version of iBooks Author, which as you can see in the image above includes a new Preview Books feature for Mac, and a few bug fixes. Users of iBooks Author can find the update in the Mac App Store.
* Folks looking to grab the newest version of iTunes can find it either on Apple’s website, or via the Mac App Store’s ‘Updates’ tab. If you have a Mac and would like to learn more about today’s Mavericks update, click here. It’s free and available now.
