* According to a recent report from AdWeek, Apple has instructed TBWA\Media Arts Lab to sharpen focus on digital and regional advertising campaigns.
* Apple is said to have been streamlining its global marketing efforts and restructuring relationship with its longtime global advertising partner.
* The Cupertino company now wants the legendary agency to focus more on creating tailor-made campaigns for regional markets and less on translating its big brand campaigns for global markets. As a result of the change, TBWA\Media Arts Lab’s Los Angeles headquarters and other offices around the world had to layoff an unknown number of translation and transcreation staff.
* Apple’s focus on advertising campaigns customized for specific markets was on display last week as it released a new iPhone 7 Plus ad, titled Meu Bloco na Rua and focused on a Brazilian Carnival, which begins on the afternoon of February 24.
* “TBWA\Media Arts Lab is reorganizing and introducing a new operating model to keep pace with the way people consume media and content,” said an agency spokesperson.
* “This will result in a reduction in areas such as localization and further investment in areas such as digital, social, data analytics, content creation and a more diverse set of strategic skills. We will also have greater integration with media partners at OMD.”
* Apple’s recently produced a number of short promotional videos, designed to keep pace with the way people consume media and content on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube.
* The latest example of Apple’s social-friendly ads: 15-second iPad Pro videos, based on real tweets from real people and reminiscent of the legendary “Mac vs. PC” campaign.
* Following Steve Jobs’s passing, Apple expanded its in-house advertising team to more than a thousand employees. In recent years, the firm’s moved some of its splashy, TV-focused brand work from the Omnicom network to its own marketing team.
* “While Media Arts Lab will continue to play a role in producing those big-picture campaigns, the agency’s teams from London to Tokyo have been instructed to devote more resources to local market work moving forward,” read the article.
* An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the changes.
* In December 2015, it was announced that Tor Myhren, who left global advertising agency Grey Worldwide, joined Apple as its new Vice President of Marketing Communications, reporting to Tim Cook.
