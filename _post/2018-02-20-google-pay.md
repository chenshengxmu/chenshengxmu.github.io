* Google on Tuesday announced that its new and consolidated mobile payments service, Google Pay, is now available as a standalone app in Play Store.
* The solution replaces the outdated Google Wallet service and Android Pay, a previous solution that let Android users buy goods with their smartphones. The Wallet app has been renamed Google Pay Send and received a fresh coat of paint to go with the Google Pay brand.
* Google Pay combines features from both services, including the ability to pay at checkout counters with an Android-powered smartphone or tablet. There’s also the option to scan into transit systems in cities such as Kiev, London and Portland, initially.
* It works with Google’s partners, allowing customers to use the service to purchase goods online through websites or using Google Assistant, in addition to in stores with a smartphone.
* “We’re currently working on bringing Google Pay to all Google products, so whether you’re shopping on Chrome or with your Assistant, you’ll have a consistent checkout experience using the cards saved to your Google Account,” said the firm.
* Key features include:
