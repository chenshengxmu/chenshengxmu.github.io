* Weeks into its September 2012 debut, Apple started gradually rolling out the iPhone 5 to more than two dozen regional wireless carriers in the United States. The move signaled a change in the company’s longtime strategy of offering the iPhones only through major U.S. telcos such as AT&T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Sprint Nextel.
* Following the September 10 iPhone 5s/5c announcement and subsequent September 20 availability, nine regional carriers today announced that both new iPhones will land on their respective networks next Tuesday, October 1, 2013…
* The following telcos (via MacRumors) have announced October 1 launch:
* • Appalachian Wireless • Bluegrass Cellular • C Spire • Cellcom • GCI • MTA • Nex-Tech Wireless • Ntelos • Strata
* MacRumors notes that a few other regional telcos have announced that both new iPhones are “coming soon” so we’ll keep you up to date.
* At post time, pricing information was scarce as only Appalachian Wireless would confirm pricing. According to the carrier, the 16/32GB iPhone 5c will set you back $49.99/$149.99 while the 16/32/64 iPhone 5s will be priced at $149.99/$249.99/$349.99.
* All these prices require a two-year service agreement and an activation fee may apply.

* If you can’t stand any of the big four telcos, perhaps jumping ship would make sense? Before taking the plunge, however, you’re advised to check out a carrier’s coverage map because regional telcos operate, well, regional rather than nationwide networks.
* Last year, regional carriers undercut the likes of AT&T, Verizon and others by $50 or more, typically offering a 16GB iPhone 5 on a two-year contract or month-to-month for an upfront payment of $150.
* People who hate long-term contracts (that’d be me) and live in one of the areas covered by the aforementioned carriers should at the very least consider going prepaid.
* Of course, T-Mobile with its monthly installments and attractive prepaid plans has changed the game quite a bit so it should be interesting seeing how regional prepaid carriers respond.
