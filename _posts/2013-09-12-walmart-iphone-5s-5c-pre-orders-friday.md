* Just as Apple’s U.S. carrier partners Verizon and Sprint announced iPhone 5c pre-orders beginning Friday at 12:01am Pacific, the U.S. retail chain Walmart said Thursday it too will start taking pre-orders for the device tomorrow.
* The retailer typically carries iPhones at prices lower than other stores and new iPhones are no different: an iPhone 5s with sixteen gigabytes of storage will cost you $189 after a two-year contract, which is $10 cheaper from standard $199 downpayment…
* As for the more affordable iPhone 5c, the entry-level version of the plastic handset will set you back $79, a $20 cheaper than the standard upfront payment of $99. Again, these prices are based on eligible upgrade or a new two-year contract with AT&T, Verizon or Sprint.
* It seems Walmart is only offering iPhone 5s and 5c models with sixteen gigabytes of storage. Only the iPhone 5c is up for pre-order at Walmart and both devices will be available for in-store pickup from September 20.

* You may also want to check with your nearest Apple Store or Best Buy store as these outlets are know to price-match offers from other retailers, though the policy varies from one store to another.
* Apple announced iPhone 5c pre-orders start tomorrow, September 13. Curiously enough, the firm will not be offering pre-orders for the iPhone 5s. Both handsets are scheduled to go on sale next Friday, September 20.

* The devices will initially launch in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
* The company has promised that both new iPhones will be available in over 100 countries across 270 carries by December of this year. Last year, the iPhone 5 was available in a hundred countries and on 240 carriers by year’s end.
