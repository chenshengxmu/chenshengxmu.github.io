* Earlier this morning, Apple released iOS 6.1.2 to the public. The update contains a fix for the infamous Exchange calendar bug, as well as the passcode glitch that surfaced last week. But what really mattered to us is if it fixes the exploits used in the evasi0n jailbreak.
* Well good news. According to evad3rs team-member planetbeing, the new firmware appears to still be jailbreakable. The hacker announced on Twitter a few moments ago that though he hasn’t had a chance to try it on all devices yet, iOS 6.1.2 is looking good…
* Not yet able to test all devices, but it’s looking good for 6.1.2. iPad mini wi-fi and iPhone 5 are still jailbreakable.

* Obviously, you’ll still want to avoid updating for the time being. Aside from further testing being needed, we’re expecting that, similar to last week’s update, we’ll have to wait for the evad3rs to release a new version of evasi0n to recognize iOS 6.1.2 as a supported firmware, which will apparently be released later today.
* We will release evasi0n 1.4 later today that marks iOS 6.1.2 as supported.

* But it’s always a relief to hear that a software update doesn’t kill a jailbreak, especially one that we seemingly waited on for so long. I’m willing to bet, though, that now that Apple has fixed the two major bugs in iOS 6.1, it’s going to focus its attention on evasi0n’s exploits.
* As always, we’ll keep you updated, and let you know as soon as a new version of evasi0n is available.
