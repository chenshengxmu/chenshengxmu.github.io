* Apple just announced that developers of tvOS apps are now able to upload a short video demo to be previewed along their apps’ description and screenshots in the Apple TV App Store. Similar to what we’ve seen for some time in the iOS App Store, these short previews are usually more helpful than a screenshot as they can show the game or application in action.
* Showcase your tvOS app in action by bringing its features and functionality alive with a short video on the App Store for Apple TV. By providing an app preview, you can help customers better understand your app and encourage more downloads.
* A simple, yet nice little touch that developer will hopefully implement.
