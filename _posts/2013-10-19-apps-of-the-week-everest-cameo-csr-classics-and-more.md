* If you are in the mood for a casual game that will challenge your brain, then this app has what you are looking for. Players move block around on a grid to place them in a specific patter. Some blocks require one move, other require two or three moves. The key is knowing what block to move where, and in what order. It can get very complicated when you add more blocks and moves. While you are giving your brain a workout, you’ll be settling your mind to the relaxing ambient sounds that accompany each puzzle. This game is available for $0.99.

* True racing fans and car aficionados love more than just brand new, top-of-the-line speed demons. They also love the classics, the cars that started it all.
