* You’ll be able to spend hands-on time with an Apple Watch at Apple’s retail stores without making a purchase. Although some sources previously mentioned trying on Watches by appointment, 9to5Mac has learned that try on appointments won’t be necessary after all.
* Apple will start taking pre-orders for the Watch on April 10, ahead of its April 24 launch. April 10 is also when the Watch will arrive for “preview” in retail stores. Apple Retail will begin training employees on selling the device at the end of March.
* “Appointments can be made online or through the Apple Store app — they’re recommended, but not necessary,” reads Apple’s internal memo to employees.
* “Customers who come to your store without one will be taken care of,” confirms the internal communications sent out to Apple’s retail army.
* If I were to offer an advice on buying a Watch, I’d urge you to make an appointment after all, just to be on the safe side and avoid standing in line. With the amount of press the device has been getting in the past few weeks, I’m expecting big crowds during the launch weekend on April 24.

* Arriving April 24 to Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, the Apple Watch starts at $349 for the aluminum Sport edition.
* The stainless steel Apple Watch will set you back between $549 and $1,049 for the smaller 38mm version ($599 – $1,099 for the 42mm variant), depending on your band of choice.
* The 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition starts out at ten grands and goes all the way up to an astounding $17,000, depending on a band.
* A recent Reuters poll indicated that one out of each four Americans want an Apple Watch, based on surveying 1,245 online users between March 9 and March 13.
