* The OWC mini USB-C travel dock is a handy companion to keep inside your gear bag. The hub brings USB Type-A and Type-C ports, HDMI, and even an SD card reader.
* We have taken a look at quite a few larger USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 hubs, but few are as convenient to take on the go as the OWC USB-C travel dock.

* The OWC USB-C Travel Dock is a small square hub with several useful ports.

* The ports include:
* The cable is permanently attached, which means you never need to fret about losing it.
* I like that the body is made out of anodized aluminum, and it matches my MacBook well.
* This is a handy little box with quite a few tricks.
* The USB ports are handy, and the HDMI even supports 4K at 30Hz.

* The integrated cable means you won’t ever lose it, and the metal edges should help it stand up over time.
* The anodized body also comes in different finishes as well. They just so happen to match the four available colors for the MacBook; Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Rose Gold.
* On the downside, I wish there was another USB-C port or two. The one there is only useful because it supports passthrough charging at up to 60W. Since everything is moving to USB-C, why do we only get additional USB Type-A ports for expansion? Much of my gear has already been converted to to Type-C, and would prefer if more hubs supported it.
* The other downside is that since the cable is integrated, you won’t be able to remove it, or swap it for a longer one. If you need a longer cable, you will have to check elsewhere.
* I could also see the benefit of a Micro SD card reader as well. If you are on the go with something like a GoPro that uses the smaller memory card, you will have to remember to bring along an adapter.
* As it usually goes with gear like this, it depends wholeheartedly on your workflow. Do you use more USB-C accessories than USB-A? Do you need DisplayPort instead of HDMI? Perhaps a Micro SD card reader? If the answer is yes to any of those, then maybe look at another option.

* However, if you need some additional USB-A ports, the popular HDMI video output, and a standard card reader, then the OWC Travel Dock will do just fine.
* You can find it on Amazon for $49.88 in one of four different color options.
