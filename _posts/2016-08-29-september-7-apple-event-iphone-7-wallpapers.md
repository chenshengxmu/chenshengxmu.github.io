* Apple just announced the iPhone 7 media event, to be held on September 7. Their invitation has sparked many comments and additional rumors about the content of the media event. “See you on the 7th” could hint at many different announcements, but perhaps the strongest is optical or camera upgrades.
* Per usual, the goal of our Wallpapers of the Week series is to highlight photo quality images for your iOS devices. Apple media event wallpapers for iPhone are always our most popular posts. These images are submitted to me via Twitter @jim_gresham. If you would like to add your images, simply send them my way.
* Step inside for the latest download, in a post that will be updated throughout the day!
