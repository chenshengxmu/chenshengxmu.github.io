* With watchOS 5, you can control how loud Siri speaks responses on your Apple Watch.
* An Apple Watch Series 3 or newer is required to have Siri speak to you, by the way. On earlier models, Siri will only display replies on your wrist along with text or images.
* Apple Watch Series 3 features a pretty powerful built-in speaker and microphone that make it easier to converse with Siri, conduct phone calls, listen to music and more, all hands-free.
* In order to help Apple Watch wearers customize their Siri experience, watchOS includes a dedicated voice volume control for Siri on Apple Watch Series 3 and newer models.
* This wasn’t possible on older watchOS editions.
* To reiterate, this feature requires the following:
* Of course, Siri must be enabled on the watch.
* To set the volume of spoken Siri responses separately from the main system volume.
* 1) Open Settings on your Apple Watch.
* 2) Choose General from the list.
* 3) Tap Siri.
* 4) Scroll down until you stumble upon the heading Voice Volume — Speaker, then tap on the slider below and turn the Digital Crown to adjust how loud or quiet you’d like Siri to be.
* This setting applies to spoken responses via the built-in speaker, not when Siri is used with your Apple Watch connected to wireless Bluetooth headphones or AirPlay speakers and devices.
* Curiously enough, a version of Siri found on iPhone, iPad and HomePod currently does not permit users to set the volume of voice commands independently of the main system volume.
* Of course, a future software update could easily implement that feature on other devices.
