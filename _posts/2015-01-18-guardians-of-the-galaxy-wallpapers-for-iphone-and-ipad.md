* Last week’s post of space galaxies proved to be a big hit! This is a consistent theme proved to be enjoyed by readers. You can find additional galaxy themed wallpapers in the following posts: galaxy creation, stars and moons, and galaxy wallpapers. Moreover, our Interstellar movie inspired wallpapers are in the same theme.
* Taking movie and galaxy themes to the next level, I asked readers to submit their favorite Guardians of the Galaxy wallpapers for iOS devices. Very quickly, I received a solid collection of submissions via Twitter. Below is a curated list of great Guardians wallpapers with credit to the submitters.
* Regarding the size selection of the images below, they were submitted by readers. Because the following list was sourced by readers, only the sizes submitted are included. If you are looking for a specific device size, I encourage you to contact the submitter via Twitter. When collecting images from submissions, it is difficult to maintain a consistent file size because different readers collect wallpapers for their varied personal iOS devices.
* To begin the selection, the following wallpapers were submitted by @anmol_iam.
