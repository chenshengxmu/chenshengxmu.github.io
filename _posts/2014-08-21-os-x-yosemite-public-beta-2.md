* Apple has just released the second version of the OS X Yosemite Public Beta and a new beta build of the thoroughly overhauled iTunes 12 for Yosemite.
* The second public Yosemite beta arrives after the first public beta was made available at the end of last month and is basically the same as OS X Yosemite Developer Preview 6 seeded to Apple’s registered developers last week.
* Both updates are available to download through the Mac App Store for those who’ve applied for the OS X Beta Program…
* The public beta 2 of Yosemite now carriers a build number of ’14A329r’ versus Developer Preview 6’s build number of ’14A329f’. As for the newly issued iTunes 12 beta, it carries a build number of 12.0.0.97 (was 12.0.0.81 before).
