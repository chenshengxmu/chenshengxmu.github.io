* Apple’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that have just been unveiled at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, California will go on sale in the United States on Friday, September 19, confirmed the company.
* Pre-orders will start this Friday.
* The 4.7-inch model starts at $199 while the bigger 5.5-inch model carries a $100 premium, running you $299 for the entry-level with sixteen gigabytes of storage. Like before, these are subsidized so a two-year contract with your wireless carrier is required in most cases.
* Interestingly enough, Apple has dropped the 32-gigabyte model from the lineup completely. Jump past the fold for the full details on iPhone 6 pricing and availability.
* The new devices are offered in the following storage capacities — 16, 64 and 128GB.
* The iPhone 6 will set you back $199/$299/$399 for the 16/64/128GB models, after a two year-contract. The iPhone 6 Plus is priced at $299/$399/$499 for models with 16/64/128 gigabytes of storage, respectively.

* “These are not only the best phones in the world, they really are a great value in the world,“ said CEO Tim Cook.
* As suspected, Apple also brought the iPhone 5s down to $99, while the 8GB iPhone 5c is now “free,” both after a two-year contract. This is Apple’s iPhone lineup after these reshuffling.

* The iPhone maker did not announce pricing of contract-free, unlocked iPhone 6 models. As a point of reference, unsubsidized iPhones typically go on sale in the United States a few months following their release, barring countries where carriers are required by law to provide unsubsidized hardware alongside contract-based offerings, like in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere.
