* According to a purported screenshot claiming to be from an internal system of a German retailer, the iPad mini could cost anywhere between €249 for the entry-level model to €649 for the top of the line model. This translates to $320 for the base model and $840 for the flagship one, although U.S. prices are likely to be lower because gadgets in Europe typically cost more due to a higher cost of doing business on the continent. In total, eight different models are said to be on offer…
* The prices come via Mobile Geeks which first leaked a screenshot from German retailer Media Market’s internal system, suggested to be authentic by the Daily Mail.

* As you can see, there should be four WiFi and four cellular models, each offered in four storage capacities: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. The top-of-the-line 64GB iPad mini with cellular would cost €649. The current third-generation iPad comes in three storage flavors: 16GB, 32GB and 64GB.
* These prices likely include taxes, unlike in the U.S.
* The introduction of the 8GB storage option on the iPad mini would be the first time an iPad was offered with just eight gigabytes of storage. $249 also buys you a 16GB Nexus 7 or Amazon’s latest Kindle (which CEO Jeff Bezos says are sold “at cost”) and other inexpensive tablets.
* It’s interesting that this leak debunks a report by The Guardian newspaper that last week claimed the iPad mini would initially be provided in WiFi configurations only due to price concerns.
* Direct price comparison by translating European prices to U.S. dollars is wrong because gadgets in Europe typically are pricier than in the United States. For example, an entry-level MacBook Air will run you €1,049 in one of Apple’s European online stores, which translates into approximately $1,400, or a $400 premium over the notebook’s $999 U.S. price.
* If the European prices leaked from Media Market are the real deal, I’ guessing the iPad mini would begin at $299 in the U.S., just as we heard before.
* Bill of material for the iPad 2 and iPad 3

* A $299 iPad mini would cost Apple just $189 to build, Tech-Thoughts thinks, meaning Apple could net about a hundred bucks per each entry-level iPad mini sold.
* Last week, AllThingsD, a Wall Street Journal-owned blog, reported that Apple will hold an iPad mini event on October 23 at Town Hall Auditorium on its Cupertino, California headquarters.
* What do you think the iPad mini should cost?
