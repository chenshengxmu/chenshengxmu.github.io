* Like clockwork, Apple takes its online store offline ahead of any major new production introductions. Today’s live-streamed WWDC keynote is no exception: with just a few hours left until the keynote presentation begins, Apple Online Stores around the world have gone offline with a message saying “We’ll be back. We’re busy updating the Apple Store for you. Please check back soon”.
* The rumor-mill, Apple analysts and pundits have been saying that the iPhone maker will unveil some new hardware products at WWDC, which is normally a software-centric event.
* Some of the gadgets that could be formally introduced at WWDC include a dedicated Siri speaker, a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model,  as well as refreshed MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks with Intel’s Kaby Lake chips and updated system architecture.
* Though Apple’s been criticized for its seeming inability to update store listings without taking the whole web store down, risking losing potential sales, this is now more of a marketing vehicle designed to drum up excitement ahead of major events than it is a technical issue.
