* Uber for iPhone was updated on App Store yesterday and it brings back seamless integration with Apple Maps and the ability to hail a ride using the Siri smart assistant, the two features that were removed without explanation from the previous update issued in January.
* Although release notes for Uber for iPhone version 3.284.10001 make no mention of this, Siri and Maps integration has been indeed reinstated.
* UPDATE: It would seem Siri integration is currently limited to customers in the United States, with non-US users getting a “Sorry, there was a problem with the app” message from Siri.

* MacRumors has spotted the same problem with Uber’s Siri integration.
* If necessary, you may need to manually reenable these two features by sliding the Use with Siri switch to the ON position in Settings → Uber → Siri & Search. Also, turn on Maps integration for Uber in Setting → Maps, right underneath the Ride Booking Extensions heading.
* Uber is a free download from App Store.
