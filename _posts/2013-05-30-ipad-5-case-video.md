* A rather credible Vietnamese publication has posted a video Thursday which purportedly depicts a case thought to have been designed for Apple’s next-generation full-size iPad, the iPad 5. Now, rumor mills expect the next iPad to adopt the iPad mini’s narrow side bezels and thinner appearance.
* Although iDB couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video at press time, it does indicate that narrower side bezels on the iPad 5 could result in a device that’s both narrower and has slightly reduced height compared to the current-generation iPad 4…
* The video has been posted by Vietnamese publication Tinhte.vn.

* As you can see, the assumed size difference between the current and next iPad becomes apparent when the guy holds an iPad 4 over the alleged iPad 5 case.
* Given how the iPad 5 is expected to rock the same 9.7-inch screen, the smaller dimensions mostly stem from iPad mini-style skinnier side bezels and a tweaked iOS multitouch algorithm designed to dismiss false positive finger inputs occurring from holding the device in one’s hand.
* Note that Tinhte.vn has solid connections in Apple’s test and production network and as such has proven itself reliable.
* For instance, the web site leaked the fourth-generation iPod touch and back in March 2012 posted benchmarks indicating the iPad 3 would come equipped with a 1GHz processor and 1GB of RAM, which proved true.
* They were also the first with the iPad 3 unboxing video and the redesigned EarPods clip.
* And just last month, Tinhte.vn reported the iPhone 5S will sport a 12-megapixel back camera with improved night shooting mode.
