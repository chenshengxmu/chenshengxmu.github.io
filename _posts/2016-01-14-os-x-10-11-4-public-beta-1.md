* In addition to iOS 9.3, Apple also seeded the first beta of OS X 10.11.4 to public beta testers on Thursday. If you are a member of Apple’s public testing program, or would like more information, you can find the latest releases and details here.
* Today’s releases follow developer seeds of iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4 on Monday. While 9.3 includes a number of major additions, the 10.11.4 features just a handful of changes, such as support for Live Photos in Messages and passwords in Notes.
* It’s worth noting that the current, non-beta version of OS X is 10.11.2, which was released in early December. So both 10.11.3 and 10.11.4 are currently in testing. It’s believed that Apple will be releasing OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 to the public shortly.
* It’s been a busy week for Apple’s software teams, developers and beta testers. On Monday, several beta releases were seeded including the aforementioned 9.3, 10.11.4, as well as tvOS 9.2 for the fourth-gen Apple TV and watchOS 2.2 for Apple Watch.
