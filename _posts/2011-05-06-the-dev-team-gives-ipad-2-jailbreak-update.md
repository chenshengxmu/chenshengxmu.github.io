* Less than 3 days after Apple released the new 4.3.3 firmware, leaders of the jailbreak community have already provided provided several way to hack the new software.
* The infamous Dev Team updated their popular PwnageTool and RedSn0w applications to jailbreak all iDevices that support Apple’s latest firmware, excluding the iPad 2.
* I know, the wait is becoming unbearable. Luckily, the Dev Team gave us an update on the current status of the iPad 2 jailbreak:
* The iPad2 jailbreak remains under development. As you may know, the original exploit @comex developed in the first week of the iPad2 release was mysteriously fixed by Apple within days of its development. Partly because of this, don’t expect much public discussion of the iPad 2 jailbreak until its actually finished and ready for release (and please avoid asking about it). In all likelihood, it will be a userland exploit like the first (unreleased) one, not dependent on bootrom dumps.
* For those of you wondering why hackers have the ability to jailbreak the iPad 2 and haven’t shared it with the masses yet, the Dev Team explains:
* The first one can’t be released even for those with the original 4.3 firmware due to legal (distribution) reasons.
* It’s good to know the Dev Team has not forgotten about us folks who are starving for a jailbreak solution for Apple’s latest tablet. It’ll be interesting to see if members of the Dev Team can beat Geohot and the Chronic Dev team to the iPad 2 jailbreak, who are reportedly using a method that requires a bootrom dump.
* What do you think?
