* Apple will be supporting Magical Bridge Foundation’s Innovation Zone at an all-new accessible playground in Sunnyvale, California, the non-profit announced Tuesday.
* The playground will be nestled in the 15.2-acre Fair Oaks Park.
* According to the organization, Innovation Zone is a dynamic space within the Sunnyvale playground for people of all ages and abilities to meet, learn and build new relationships.
* The playground was designed to accomodate children and adults with a wide range of physical and cognitive abilities. Apple is one of the area’s largest employers.
* Magical Bridge co-founder Olenka Villarreal said:
* The dream to build magical spaces where people of all abilities can feel freedom of play has become a reality because companies like Apple and our other partners are so committed to this community, its residents and visitors. The joy is contagious. Magical Bridge Playgrounds are changing neighborhoods, cities, and soon, the country through truly inclusive play.
* This new playground should open to the public in 2020.
* The Magical Bridge Foundation organization operates three such playgrounds, including the original in Palo Alto that was established in 2015 and serves 20,000 visitors a month.
* One in five Americans lives with some form of disability.
