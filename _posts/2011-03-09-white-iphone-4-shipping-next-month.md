* Here we go again! The rare and much anticipated White iPhone 4 is supposedly coming next month.
* According to a new report from Concord Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuofrom, Apple will begin production of its White iPhone 4 sometime this month, with the launch taking place sometime in early April…
* Apple is expected to begin production of its long-awaited iPhone 4 sometime this month, with shipments no later than early April, according to one analyst’s checks.
* Manufacturers will initiate production of the GSM-based iPhone 4 version in white enclosures and begin dispatching them to Apple ahead of general availability planned for next month, Concord Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told AppleInsider. Apple has made changes the “film material to solve the full-lamination problem that [was] the reason why white iPhones [were] delayed,” he added.
* Honestly, with the iPhone 5 literally 3 months away, I don’t see any point in releasing the white iPhone 4 now.
* What say you? Will you buy a White iPhone 4 once it’s available?
