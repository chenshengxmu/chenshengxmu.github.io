* New to the iPhone arena? What better way to start out then by scoring a free iPhone 3GS from Best Buy on Friday, December 10th. That’s right free, zero, nada, ziltch.
* That’s $99 dollars cheaper than the current going rate for the least expensive iPhone, and a pretty rare find for an Apple product. Check inside for the full scoop…
* Although the iPhone 3GS lacks some of the features of the iPhone 4, most notably a front facing camera for FaceTime calls, it’s no slouch when it comes to mobile phones. If you’re new to the iPhone, you certainly can’t go wrong with a free iPhone 3GS.
* Reports state that the promotion is available to all, including upgrades and additional lines of service. The only downside is that you will have to sign a 2-year agreement with AT&T, but if you’re in the market for an iPhone, and you’re in the USA, you knew that already.
* There’s currently no word on whether or not Best Buy will run a similar promotion outside of the USA.
