* Those crazy Taiwanese animators are back at it, this time with a take on recent rumors calling for a bigger iPhone. True to their quick and dirty style, the somewhat cheesy animation takes us through the latest from the rumor-mill, both crazy stories and those corroborated by established media outlets.
* We couldn’t resist sharing it with you as the clip kinda summarizes major iPhone 5 headlines, even if it’s taking inappropriate to new levels…
* It looks all the pieces of the puzzle are slowly falling into place.
* Despite Apple scoring a small victory in its ongoing patent litigation that saw new HTC phones being held up at the U.S. customs briefly, the company conceded the #1 smartphone vendor title to Samsung.
* Meanwhile, critics keep saying that the iPhone is losing its allure due to its smallish 3.5-inch display.
* Clearly, we need a bigger iPhone.
* The Wall Street Journal gave the bigger iPhone meme a much-needed credence of credibility and Bloomberg raised expectations with claims that Steve Jobs oversaw its redesign.
* Analysts are backtracking and are now saying that no, Qualcomm chip shortages won’t affect Apple’s 4G LTE plans after all.
* And everyone else and their mother swear that Apple will introduce the next iPhone at next month’s WWDC, with sales pinpointed for an August-October timeframe.
* Even developers are embracing the idea of a bigger iPhone and Apple added fuel to fire by securing the iPhone5.com domain name.
* And now, topping it all off, Taiwan-based Next Media Animation distills all the iPhone 5 nuggets into a hundred second clip.
* Here it is.
* Yes, this is inappropriate taken to new levels, but that’s beyond the point.
* What matters is the next iPhone and its display size.
* Indeed, an iDB poll has revealed that nearly one in two would prefer a four-inch handset and every fourth polled person would feel comfortable holding an iPhone with a 4.3-inch display like that on the Galaxy Nexus.
* So, do you think that bigger is better?
* Make sure to vote in our poll and then come back here to share your thoughts with others down in the comments.
