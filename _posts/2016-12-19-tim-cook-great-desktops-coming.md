* Apple has “great desktops” in its roadmap, CEO Tim Cook said in a recent posting to an employee message board. TechCrunch has the transcript, where Cook fields a question regarding whether or not Mac desktops are still strategic for Apple.
* The comments come after the company’s MacBook Pro event this October, where iMacs and Minis were noticeably absent. It’s been over 430 days since Apple updated the former, and nearly 800 days for the latter. The Mac Pro is 3+ years old.
* Here’s the full question and Cook’s response:
* We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in the spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?
* The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people.
* The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. 
* Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.
* During the Q&A session Cook also fielded questions regarding his recent meeting with President-elect Donald Trump, and what he feels is Apple’s biggest differentiator in the increasingly competitive tech space, which you can read over at TechCrunch.
