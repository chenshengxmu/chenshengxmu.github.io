* Even if it doesn’t look like it on paper, this has been a big year for T-Mobile. Since January, the company has launched its LTE network, unveiled new plans, and has managed to get the attention of the larger carriers with its new ‘Jump‘ device upgrade program.
* But perhaps the biggest thing that happened to T-Mobile this year was that it finally inked an iPhone deal. Until March, it was the only major US carrier not offering the handset. And according to a new study, landing it likely saved them over 300,000 customers…
* The study comes from the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (via Electronista), who conducted a poll with subscribers at T-Mobile prior to the iPhone launch. The results found that 25% of them were looking to jump ship before learning about the iPhone.

* To be honest, I’m not quite sure where they get the 300,000 number. Their testing sample was small—like 500 people small—and it wasn’t defined. But I suppose they could have extrapolated their findings and applied them to T-Mobile’s churn over the last quarter.
* Regardless, the data isn’t surprising considering that the carrier reportedly sold 500,000 iPhones in the handset’s first month, and nearly 1 million iPhones all together during the June quarter. A lot of folks were clearly awaiting the arrival of the popular smartphone.
* The big takeaway here is that T-Mobile has found a way to keep a large number of its customers on board, which is a big deal for carriers. Add to that the 9 million or so new subscribers it’s gaining from its recent MetroPC acquisition, and things start to get interesting.
