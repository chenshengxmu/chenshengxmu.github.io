* The Deck teaser video with a simulator preview was nice, but nothing does it justice like a little hands-on action.
* A few minutes ago I was able to go one-on-one with the upcoming Deck jailbreak tweak from SBCoders.
* Is it as smooth as the initial preview video? You betcha.
* Deck allows you to invoke a “hotbar” from the Home screen, which allows you to access a plethora of system functions, apps, and shortcuts.
* The tweak is still in beta, but as you can tell from the video, it’s running really smooth right now.
* We’ll let you know as soon as it drops on Cydia, but in the meantime tell us what you think about it. Does Deck have a place reserved in your iPhone workflow?
