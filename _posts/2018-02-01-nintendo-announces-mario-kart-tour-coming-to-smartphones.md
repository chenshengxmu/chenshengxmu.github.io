* Start your engines folks, Nintendo has just announced a new smartphone game, Mario Kart Tour. The upcoming game is currently in development, with a planned release during Nintendo’s fiscal year.
* Nintendo’s CEO has shared that the title is currently being worked on, but neglects to provide any other information.
* In fact, the only things we do know is the title, and the fact it will be released sometimes in the next 13 months.
* Nintendo notes that more information will be forthcoming as they are further in the development cycle, and can comfortably give a release date.
* As a huge Mario Kart fan, I am overjoyed that we will finally see the title make the jump to iOS. Fingers crossed it is able to do the franchise justice.
* The checkered flag has been raised and the finish line is near. A new mobile application is now in development: Mario Kart Tour! #MarioKartTour Releasing in the fiscal year ending in March 2019. pic.twitter.com/8GIyR7ZM4z
