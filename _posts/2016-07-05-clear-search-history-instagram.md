* Instagram users who search for things frequently leave a trail behind that shows everything they’ve searched for, and to some who are used to hiding their tracks, this could be considered a privacy concern.
* If you want to clear your search history from the Instagram app on your iPhone or iPod touch, then follow along as we take you through the simple steps to do so in this tutorial.
* Any time you search for a page, a person, or even a trending topic, and you tap on any of the search result Instagram logs the pages you open under your search history.
* This history appears any time you tap on the search field and attempt to perform a new search from the Instagram app, as shown below:
