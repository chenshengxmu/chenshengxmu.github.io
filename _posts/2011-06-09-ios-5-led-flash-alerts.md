* I remember a long time ago when I had my BlackBerry, one of the simple features I appreciated the most was the little LED flashing everytime I received a call, or if I had an unread text message. It was an unobtrusive way to tell me something was going on.
* iOS 5 is bringing this idea to the iPhone 4. If you go to Settings > General > Accessibility, and turn LED Flash for Alerts ON, your iPhone camera flash will now flash when receiving a call or an alertâ€¦
* This video shows the feature in action:
* How do you like this new feature?
