* If you prefer Google’s Chrome over Apple’s Safari on your Mac desktops and notebooks, good news: the search monster yesterday updated the browser with a few new features that help restrict kids’ use of the Internet while boosting their parents’ protection from malware.
* I was instantly sold on the incredibly useful noisy tab indicators that make it easier to figure out which tab sound is coming from.
* Now, why didn’t I think of that? Chrome 32 for Mac, Windows and Linux is now available for download and there’s a detailed description of the new features right below…
* Glance over your open tabs in Chrome 32 and you should see a tiny icon on the tab that produces sound. This is quite handy if you keep a few dozen tabs open and can’t figure out which YouTube tab your music is streaming from.
* I can also imagine it being especially useful when certain websites (ahem) hijack your browser and play video “promos” in the background.
* Here are the new tab indicators.
* Gotcha! Here’s the noisy offender.

* Using your webcam.

* Streaming to your TV using Chromecast.

* I love this feature a lot – simple but needed.
* If only there was a way to make each tab mutable by clicking the little speaker icon. Or better yet, give us an option to disable all autoplay on load.
* Next up is something called a supervised user feature. What’s that? Basically a parental restrictions mode where you can allow or block certain websites and manage permissions for the web page your junior (or tech-illiterate Mom) has requested to view.

* A supervised user can sign in to websites, but can’t install extensions or apps from the Chrome Web Store. It’s cool that a supervised user doesn’t need a Google Account, or even an email address for that matter.
* Creating a supervised user in Chrome is not the same as adding another user on your operating system.
* A supervised user is an additional Chrome user, and can close the supervised user windows and access other Chrome users available on the computer.
* If you are the manager of a supervised user, you can always remove your own Chrome profile from the computer or sign out of Chrome before handing it off to a supervised user.
* The manager (you) creates a profile for the supervised user (your kid or whatever) through your own Google Account, here’s how.
* Step 1: Hit the Chrome menu and select Settings.
* Step 2: In the Users section, click ‘Add new user’.
* Step 3: Choose an optional profile picture and enter a name for the supervised user
* Step 4: Tick  the ‘This is a supervised user managed by <your email address>’ box. If the checkbox is greyed out, just sign in to Chrome with your Google Account.

* The dashboard – you can see it right above – not only gives you a peek into the supervised user’s browsing history, you can also block specific websites and approve ones your children are allowed to see.
* SafeSearch is turned on by default for supervised users.
* The best bit: the dashboard is a web app so it’s accessible from any browser.
* I want that thing in the mobile version!
* And the last new feature: stronger malware protection.

* If you see this message in the download tray at the bottom of your screen, just click Dismiss “knowing that Chrome is working to keep you safe”, Google explains.
* Unfortunately, Google didn’t bother to optimize Chrome for new power-saving technologies in OS X Mavericks (or Snow Leopard, for that matter) so the browser still drains your MacBook’s battery fast and kicks that fan into overdrive.
* Until that gets sorted out, I’m using Safari on the road.
* Google actually launched these features in Chrome Developer Edition back in November and now they’re available to everyone via the latest stable Chrome release.
* Do you use Chrome for Mac?
* Is Google outgunning Apple in terms of desktop browsers?
