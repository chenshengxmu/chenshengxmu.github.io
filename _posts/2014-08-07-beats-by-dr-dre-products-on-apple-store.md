* After officially welcoming Beats to the family last week, Apple has now given the Beats by Dr. Dre range its own dedicated section on the Online Apple Store.
* Found under the new ‘Beats by Dr. Dre’ section found under the Accessories link, the Beats sub-section has even gotten a prominent placement on the navigation bar at the top, joining other sections such as ‘All Accessories,’ ‘Apple Accessories,’ ‘Exclusives,’ ‘Now Trending,’ and ‘Gift Cards’.
* The online store seems to be carrying the complete range of the popular Beats by Dr. Dre line of accessories and headphones…
* The heading reads:
* Great sound should never be an afterthought. In every pair of Beats headphones, every speaker, every note, you’ll experience the unique blend of science and artistry that lets you hear your music the way the artist intended. Don’t just listen. Hear.
* At post time, the Beats family of consumer audio equipment included the Beats headphones, in-ear headphones, speakers and accessories.
* The over-ear headphones, Apple’s marketing team writes, give you “superb comfort, enhanced clarity, and even more powerful sound, providing for an intimate music listening experience.
* “From the iconic Beats Studio to the redesigned Solo2, this is how music would sound if the artist could play it back to you in person,” reads the blurb.
* On in-ear headphones:
* Beats in-ear headphones are designed to be small and powerful, delivering the same Beats signature sound for the tunes you love. Get closer to your music with premium sound – at the gym, on the streets, wherever you go.
* And on speakers:
* Beats portable speakers let you play your favorite mix anywhere, anytime – wirelessly with Bluetooth. Sync two Pills or two Pill XLs for twice the sound, pair with iOS for hours of soaring highs and deep, rich bass, then power back up via USB.
* Beats sound accessories are designed to enhance Beats products and include sleeves for protection on the go, cables, adapters and “even something to add a little character,” the latter referencing the Beats Pill mascot, pictured below.

* The same mascot was recently used in a new ‘Apple and Beats’ TV spot.
* Online Apple Stores around the world are now promoting Beats products as well, including ones in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy.
* Furthermore, some brick-and-mortar Apple Stores are featuring select Beats products such as the recently refreshed Beats by Dr. Dre Solo2 and Studio over-ear headphones.
* “We’re delighted to be working with the team to elevate that experience even further,” wrote Apple in its message welcoming Beats to the family on another webpage.
* On its part, the Cupertino firm has confirmed it will keep operating Beats as a separate brand while Bloomberg has learned from sources that Jony Ive and his team will be working on improving the Beats headphone design.
