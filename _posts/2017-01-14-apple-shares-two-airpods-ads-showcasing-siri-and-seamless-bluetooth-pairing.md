* Apple on Saturday shared four brief television commercials for AirPods on its official YouTube channel, running fifteen seconds long each. The videos showcase some of the key user features of the wireless earphones, like accessing Siri with a double-tap and seamless Bluetooth pairing on Apple gear made possible by the firm’s in-house designed wireless chip, dubbed the W1. Watch the new ads and let us know how you like them in comments.
* In addition to the company’s first-ever AirPods ads, they also released a new fitness-focused Apple Watch advertisement which challenges you to close those Activity rings.
* “Double-tap and Siri is there,” reads the description.
* “Just flip open the case and they’re paired,” says Apple.
* These newly shared ads feature the same song, “Down” by Marian Hill.
