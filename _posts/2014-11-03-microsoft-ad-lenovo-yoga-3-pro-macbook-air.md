* Microsoft’s Windows channel on YouTube yesterday released a new commercial painting Lenovo’s Yoga Pro 3 convertible laptop as a better portable computer overall than Apple’s ultra-thin MacBook Air.
* Titled ‘Let’s Dance’, the 30-second commercial is critical of the Apple machine’s lack of a touchscreen while praising multi-mode flexibility of the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro, concluding that once you add the touchscreen to the mix, “it’s game over” because the Yoga 3 Pro proves there’s “more than one way to do what you want”.
* In addition to the MacBook Air’s lack of a touchscreen, the commercial highlights the Yoga’s thinner appearance (13 mm versus the Air’s 17 mm, though the air tapers down to just 0.3 mm) and its ability to fold back.
* Here’s the ad.

* Microsoft writes:
* It’s an epic dance-off between the new Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro and the MacBook Air. But does the MacBook Air stand a chance against the sleekness and multi-mode flexibility of the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro? Nope. And once you add the touchscreen, its game over. The Yoga 3 Pro proves there’s more than one way to do what you want.
* This brings back to memory Tim Cook’s toaster-refrigerator dilemma: in April 2012, Cook told The New York Times that while anything can be forced to converge, this doesn’t necessarily yield a better user experience.
* “You begin to make tradeoffs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn’t please anyone,” he said. “You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know, those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user”.
* What Microsoft’s ad conspicuously fails to mention is the price difference between the two machines: Apple’s MacBook Air starts at $899 while the Lenovo convertible is a $1,300 value.
* The Windows maker is no stranger to Apple bashing.
* After announcing its Surface Pro 3 back in April, the company aired several commercials positioning the device as a thinner and lighter alternative to the Air and even attempted to entice would-be switchers with a cool $650 in trade-in value for those willing to drop their MacBook Air for a Surface Pro 3.
