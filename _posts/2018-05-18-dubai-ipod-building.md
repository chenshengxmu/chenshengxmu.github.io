* The city of Dubai is constructing a peculiar building modeled on a giant docked iPod.
* Welcome to Friday, boys and girls, and no—this is not a joke. As reported earlier in the morning by Business Insider, Hong Kong architect James Law has been commissioned to create a building known as The Pad, and once called the Pad tower.
* As you can see for yourself top of post, this 24-story tower really looks like an iPod sitting in a dock and is full of technology that adapts to the environment and acts like Iron Man’s armor. Law states that the building was inspired by Apple’s iPod as a 6-degree leaning architecture.

* The luxurious building has 231 apartments with a bunch of smart features, like virtual reality windows that will give you a glimpse at various locations around the world, screens for video conferencing, RFID tags instead of keys, bathrooms with health devices and so forth.

* Rooms have virtual reality walls with changing locations
* Law told Business Insider that he wanted his building to match an iPod by having “software inside that helps you curate the enjoyment of your life, your music, your photos.”

* Bathrooms with built-in health devices monitor your weight, blood pressure and more
* “We are all connected through information technology,” he added. “You can’t live in isolation with a piece of architecture anymore, so that architecture becomes in itself just like a mobile phone.”
* In development since 2006, the Pad tower will finally open later this year.
