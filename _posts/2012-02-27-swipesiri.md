* Yesterday we told you how to dismiss Siri with your voice. Today, we’re going to show you how to dismiss Siri with a Swipe.
* SwipeSiri is a free jailbreak tweak available for Siri enabled devices that allows you to do just that.
* Check out our video coverage of SwipeSiri inside…
* SwipeSiri is simpler than DismissSiri, as it features no settings to configure.
* Once installed, a simple swipe from the bottom of your screen will cause Siri to close. This is an alternative to using the Home button to close out Siri instead.
* SwipeSiri is available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for jailbroken devices.
* What do you think?
