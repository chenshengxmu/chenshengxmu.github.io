* Google’s former CEO and Chairman, Eric Schmidt, has a penchant for exaggeration. Not just infamous for telling bad jokes, Eric is known for going into a sputter when pressed on Google’s privacy practices and making platitudinous statements on Android and rivalry with Apple that earn him headlines.
* The iPhone 6, for example, he dissed by stating that “Samsung had these products a year ago”. Sometimes, he can’t control himself to the point of risking public ridicule over claims like “Android is more secure than the iPhone”.
* No doubt a talented technology executive, he’s such a multi-layered personality and it’s therefore perfectly fine to ask ourselves what principles guide Schmidt’s thinking. Does he have a personal hero he looks up to, both in tech and outside of the technology industry?
* The answer to that question came during Schmidt’s interview at the Silicon Valley event organized by the Commonwealth Club of California.
* So, can you guess who’s Schmidt’s personal hero?
* If not, watch the full interview below — I’ve set it to start at mark 37:04, just where things get interesting.
* Surprised?
* For those who did not watch the clip, he named Apple’s Jobs his all-time personal hero. “For me, it’s easy: Steve Jobs,” he quipped.
* Here’s the full quote:
* I had the privilege of knowing him, working with him, serving on the Apple Board. And when I look at what he achieved in terms of impact on society, we could all aspire to be a small percentage of Steve.
* Schmidt had a seat on Apple’s Board of Directors for three years straight before being forced to resign in 2009 over conflict of interest and increasing rivalry between Apple and Google in mobile.
* Reflecting on the Apple Board period, Schmidt said that he and Steve were “both respectful to each other,” adding that “exceptional people are worth hanging out with, because there’s a good chance they’ll change the world.”
* Schmidt is spot on.
* Steve Jobs was a remarkable personality, the visionary and mercurial CEO who has achieved more in his lifespan than most people will ever do, his greatest accomplishment being Apple itself.
* Jonathan Rosenberg, the former Senior Vice President of Products at Google and current advisor to Google CEO Larry Page, also named the late Apple co-founder as a person in tech he looks up to.
