* As we reported a couple of days ago, RedSn0w 0.9.15b1 is now available to jailbreak A4 devices and below running iOS 6. This latest version is a pretty massive update with a lengthy change log, but the most important aspect about the update is the ability to jailbreak iOS 6 and install Cydia.
* Previous iOS 6 jailbreaks required users to install Cydia manually, but the latest public version of RedSn0w works just as you might expect it would. Take a look inside for our full tutorial.
* Note: This is a tethered jailbreak for iOS 6; A4 devices and below.
* Step 1: Download RedSn0w 0.9.15b1 and open it.
* Step 2: Place your iOS device into DFU mode. (Hold Home+Power for 10 seconds, release Power while still holding Home for an additional 10 seconds. The screen should remain black.)
* Step 3: Click Jailbreak. A few items will load, and you’ll be presented with a “Please select your options”. Ensure Install Cydia is checked, and click next. The jailbreak process will finish in about 5 minutes.
* Step 4: Once the process is complete and you’re back on the Home screen, place your device back into DFU mode.
* Step 5: Go back to the main page of RedSn0w, and select Extras > Just boot. A tethered boot will be performed, and you should see Cydia on your Home screen once your device boots back up.
* Step 6: Launch Cydia, and enjoy.
* For more in depth information on RedSn0w, be sure to check out our continuously updating dedicated RedSn0w page.
* Are you happy to finally have access to Cydia without manually installing it?
