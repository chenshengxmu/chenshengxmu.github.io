* This has been a big week for iOS games. Following the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Sega’s anticipated, remastered Sonic the Hedgehog 2 update has landed in the App Store.
* First announced in October, the free update sees the game rebuilt by Christian Whitehead and Simon Thomley— the same guys who did the first Sonic the Hedgehog iOS game remaster—with better graphics, FPS and much more…

* From the App Store:
* “An all new ‘Boss Attack mode’ challenges the player to defeat all of the game’s devious bosses in one run. Additionally choose to play the game as Knuckles in addition to Sonic and Tails.
* For the first time ever explore the mysterious Hidden Palace Zone.  These lost levels feature undiscovered enemies, new hazards and a climatic showdown with Dr. Eggman.
* Rebuilt from the ground up for mobile, Sonic The Hedgehog 2 offers upgraded graphics, including widescreen display and a smooth 60fps frame rate, plus a re-mastered soundtrack. “
* I only spent a little time with the original version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 because I remember it being almost unplayable. The controls were inaccurate, and the game would randomly stutter, often times killing Sonic in the process.
* But it looks like all of the kinks have been ironed out, and if this remaster is even half as good as the first one, it’ll be worth checking out. The new version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is available as a free update, or is $2.99 in the App Store.
