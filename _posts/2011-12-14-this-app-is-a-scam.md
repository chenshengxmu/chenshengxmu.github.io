* Although Apple has done a great job keeping malicious software out of the App Store, it hasn’t quite figured out how to keep the scammers at bay. It seems like we’ve seen several misleading apps surface in the App Store over the past few months.
* What happens is, Apple will approve an application that doesn’t appear to be harmful. But for some reason, they fail to notice that the app’s description doesn’t have anything to do with what it actually does. And we’ve just come across another one…
* Craft – Build Terrain is an iOS app that appears to be some sort of MineCraft game client — but it’s not. The word MineCraft appears multiple times in its App Store description, and its screen shots are of MineCraft, but the app is definitely a scam.
* Check out some of its App Store reviews:
* “This game is a total scam and all you do is make a stupid block jump through obstacles.
* This app is a scam! All that is shown in the preview pictures are creations made by the REAL game of MineCraft. You WILL be  very excited about this app but trust all of the reviews!!! We are NOT lying.
* This is a freaking scam DONT waste your money!!!!
* This is a rip off, I want my money back!”
* The trend continues through the rest of the reviews. Even with the developers’ tiny warning at the bottom of its app’s description that claims that Craft – Build Terrain doesn’t have anything to do with MineCraft, people still seem to be misled on what it does.
* We’re wondering how long it’s going to take for Apple to remove the application or make the developers change its description. But in the meantime, we recommend steering clear of Craft – Build Terrain, and just downloading the real MineCraft client.
