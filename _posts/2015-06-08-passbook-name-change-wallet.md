* During its WWDC conference today, Apple announced that it has decided to change the name of its stock iOS app Passbook to Wallet. The move makes sense, considering that last fall it took over Apple Pay duties, and soon it will be getting store and reward cards.
* That’s right, you can now add store and rewards cards from retailers and restaurants. Kohl’s, Walgreens, Dunkin Donuts are all apparently on board for the launch of this initiative, and it sounds like Apple is talking to a number of other high profile partners.
* Here are some quotes from partner executives:
* “Providing our shoppers with innovative ways to pay while offering flexibility, supports our commitment to delivering a simple and convenient customer experience,” said Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chairman, CEO and president. “By integrating with Apple Pay in all of our stores, Kohl’s customers can choose how they want to pay, whether using their Kohl’s Charge or Yes2You Rewards loyalty points, payments are easy and secure.”
* “Our customers around the country already depend on Dunkin’ Donuts as their all-day, everyday stop to keep them going,” said Nigel Travis, chairman and CEO, Dunkin’ Brands. “We can’t think of a better way to reward their loyalty than by offering Apple Pay and the option to use personalized rewards with their purchases.” 
* Utilizing rewards cards will be easier than ever before with Wallet. Users will simply need to add their participating rewards and store-issued cards into the new Wallet app, and they’ll find them ready to be used the next time they go to check out with Apple Pay.
* Apple Pay Rewards and the new Wallet app will be available in iOS 9, which launches in beta form to developers today and to the general public in the fall.
