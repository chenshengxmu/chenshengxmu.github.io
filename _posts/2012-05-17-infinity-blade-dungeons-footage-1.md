* If you own an iPad 3, Infinity Blade Dungeons is that killer game you’ve been dying to show off to your Android-toting friends. Unlike elegiac masterpieces Infinity Blade I & II that have been created by Chair Entertainment, Epic entrusted the creation of Infinity Blade Dungeons to a small team comprised of vets who worked on Gears of Wars.
* It’s one of a select few games Apple demoed during March’s iPad 3 introduction to show off the graphics prowess of its new tablet and the improved A5X chip that rocks quad-core graphics engine.
* If this new gameplay footage is anything to go by, this dungeon crawler is going to raise the ladder of console-grade gaming on portable devices…
* Joystiq got hold of this brand new Infinity Blade Dungeons gameplay footage.
* It’s awesome!
* Here, enjoy.
* As you can see, Dungeons is anything but yet another sequel to the otherwise awesome hack’n’slash-based Infinity Blade.
* An overhead view is akin to the popular Diablo series, with multiple enemies swarming your character who wields a giant axe dubbed Cataclysmic Edge and has a bunch of spells and scrolls at his disposal.
* Plus, he can forge new weapons as well!
* IGN has more info on this:
* Players must craft every weapon themselves, via a surprisingly fun touch-powered forging mini-game. The mini-game is more than just flavor – the more accurately and quickly players hammer out a weapon’s imperfections and polish its blemishes, the higher level it will be, allowing players to dump more points into its damage or critical-hit chance.
* Also look forward to a bunch of upgrades for your weapons, spells and character.
* The quality of in-game graphics is amazing.
* Take a look at this screenshot.

* Man, that’s what I call eye candy!
* We couldn’t tell from the screenshots whether or not Dungeons renders action natively in the new iPad’s spectacular resolution of 2,048-by-1,536 pixels.
* A lot of Retina iPad-optimized games simply pixel-double the 1,024-by-768 canvas to Retina resolution in order to avoid performance issues.
* The initial Dungeons demo from the iPad media event did reveal some stuttering in complex scenes, but that was early code.
* This game’s gonna blow your head off!

* We hope the team will be able to smooth out the rough edges and optimized the game so it runs smoothly in the native Retina iPad resolution.
* Here’s Infinity Blade Dungeons demo shown off at the March 7 iPad unveiling.
* And this is the official trailer.
* In case you’ve been wondering, the game is set several thousand years prior to the events in the Infinity Blade series and puts you in the shoes of an apprentice weaponsmith who serves the Master of the Forge.
* Your character is “sent forth on a perilous quest to forge the one thing the Deathless will come to fear most: the Infinity Blade”.
* Sounds promising, no?

* Infinity Blade Dungeons is due to be released “later this year”, exclusively for iOS devices.
* With games like this, and AirPlay thrown into the mix, who needs dedicated consoles anyway?
