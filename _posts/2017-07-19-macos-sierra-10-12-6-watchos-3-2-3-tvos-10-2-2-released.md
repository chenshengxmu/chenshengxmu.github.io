* In addition to releasing iOS 10.3.3, Apple today released a trio of software updates for its Mac computers, Apple Watch models, and the fourth-generation Apple TV: macOS Sierra 10.12.6, watchOS 3.2.3 and tvOS 10.2.2.
* They’re bug-fix updates focused on improving the performance and security of your devices so don’t expect any significant feature changes or new user-facing features. Apple’s support document lists the security patches in macOS Sierra 10.12.6, watchOS 3.2.3 and tvOS 10.2.2.
* You can update your Mac to macOS Sierra 10.12.6 by clicking the Updates tab in Mac App Store. The full installer should be available to download at some point in the Mac App Store’s Purchased section or through this link.
* To install tvOS 10.2.2, go to Settings → System → Software Updates on your fourth-generation Apple TV and select the Check for Update option.
* If an update is available, a message will appear: choose the option Download and Install and read the onscreen instruction to install the update.
* To set your Apple TV to automatically check for new software updates, enable the option Update Automatically in Settings → System → Software Updates.
* watchOS 3.2.3 must be installed through the companion Watch app on your Apple Watch’s paired iPhone: Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom, then tap General → Software Update.
* When an update is found, tap Download and Install, enter your iPhone passcode, if requested, then accept the official terms and conditions.
* The software update will begin downloading to your Apple Watch.
* Your Apple Watch must have at least 50 percent battery, be connected to its charging disk and in range of its paired iPhone in order for the software update to complete. Updating Apple Watch software usually takes a long time to complete so feel free to fix yourself a coffee.
* You’re advised to update your iPhone to iOS 10.3.3 before installing watchOS 3.2.3.
