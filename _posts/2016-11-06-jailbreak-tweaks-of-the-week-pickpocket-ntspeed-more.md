* In what has been one of the slowest weeks for the jailbreak all year, this week has seen very little activity in terms of jailbreak tweak releases.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about what little we did see. We’ll begin by showing you our favorite releases this week and then we’ll talk about the rest.
* PickPocket – $1.99

* PickPocket is the ultimate anti-theft jailbreak tweak for your iPhone. Chock-full of features to keep thieves at bay, it can help you out by faking thieves into thinking the iPhone is off when it’s not, taking photos of their face, emailing and text messaging you, and playing loud alarms when certain questionable things happen.
* Trigger events include removing the SIM card, attempting a force restart, turning on Airplane Mode, too many wrong passcode attempts, and more.
* To learn more about how PickPocket can protect your investment, read our detailed full review.
* NtSpeed: Displays your current internet traffic speed in real time below the Status Bar (free – review)
* RoundedSwitchr: Lets you round the corners of your App switcher cards and more (free – review)
* SmartVolumeControl: Provides a better customizable volume HUD for iOS ($1.49 – review)
* Despite the slowness, great jailbreak developers continue to bring decent releases to Cydia for those who like customizing their jailbroken iPhones.
* Hopefully soon an iOS 10 jailbreak will drop and we’ll see a resurgence in tweak releases once again. If you’re itching more tweaks still, then check out last week’s roundup to see if you missed anything and stay tuned to iDB for future jailbreak tweak releases!
