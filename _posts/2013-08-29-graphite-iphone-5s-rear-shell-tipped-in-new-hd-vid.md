* So, just a few days ago we heard about a possible new iPhone 5S color: graphite. Suspiciously enough, we’ve seen little else since. This video changes all that. Introducing the purported graphite iPhone 5S rear shell (bonus: two gold iPhone 5S videos, iPhone 5C sneak peek)…
* Looks good, too!
* Jonathan from TLDToday will take it from here.
* I’m liking it a lot – looks more stylish than the black iPhone 5 yet equally stealthy.

* And here are two more videos with gold one (via 9to5Mac).
* And the controversial iPhone 5C, from six days ago.
* So, what do you think?
* Do you prefer the graphite styling over the champagne – pardon me – gold one?
* Top, left to right: black iPhone 5, graphite iPhone 5S, gold iPhone 5S, white iPhone 5C.
