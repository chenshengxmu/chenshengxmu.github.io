* ComScore is out with a new report this week regarding US smartphone platform marketshare for the March quarter. And the highly-regarded marketing research firm provides an interesting look at the current smartphone landscape by OS.
* Google, as you might have expected, is still in the lead with its Android operating system. Apple’s iOS is in a [comparatively] close second, and RIM and Microsoft come in at a distant third and fourth. Keep reading for a full breakdown…
* According to comScore’s MobiLens service, Android currently owns 51.0% of the U.S. smartphone market, up from 47.3% in the December quarter. iOS is also up from the previous quarter, sitting just behind Android with 30.7% of the market.
* Then there’s RIM, in a distant third place, with just 12.3% marketshare. The Canadian company has actually dropped 3.7% since the December rankings, as it continues to bleed marketshare. And Microsoft’s platform, Windows Phone 7, comes in dead last at 3.9%.
* We talked about this a bit yesterday after seeing RIM unveil its new BlackBerry 10 OS. The smartphone platform market has become a two-horse race between Android and iOS. But who is going to to snag, and more importantly hold on to, that crucial third spot?
* Microsoft or RIM?
