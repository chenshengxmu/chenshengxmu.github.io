* Following yesterday’s presentation of Apple’s iOS 12, watchOS 5, macOS Mojave and tvOS 12 software updates in San Jose, the full WWDC 2018 keynote talk along with other promotional videos they had played during the show are now available to stream from YouTube.
* The videos can be streamed on virtually any device via Apple’s official YouTube channel. If you haven’t watched the keynote yet, I suggest you block out two hours and fifteen minutes of your weekend time or something because this was one of the better WWDCs yet.
* Here’s the keynote video.
* If you’re watching this on the YouTube website or the mobile app, be sure to expand the description to jump to the relevant chapter that interests you, or simply click the following links:
* The following video, titled “The Developer Migration,” is a clever play on nature shows complete with Richard Attenborough-like voiceover. “One of the world’s most extraordinary species makes its annual journey to the great plains of WWDC,” reads the description.
* Do check it out, it’s so funny.
* This one explains what inspires developers themselves.
* If you’d like to watch WWDC 2018 session videos, use the official website or the WWDC 2018 app. If you’d like to read a quick list of everything Apple announced yesterday, along with links to additional press materials, visit the Apple Events page.
