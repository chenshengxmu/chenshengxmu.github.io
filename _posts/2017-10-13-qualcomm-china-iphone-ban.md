* In a retaliatory move, wireless chip giant Qualcomm is asking Chinese authorities to ban the sale and manufacture of iPhones in the country, Bloomberg reported Friday.
* China, where most iPhones are assembled, accounted for nearly one-quarter of Apple’s sales in 2016. The iconic smartphone brings in almost two-thirds of Apple’s revenue.
* Qualcomm’s suits, filed in a Beijing intellectual property court, claim patent infringement and seek injunctive relief. Company spokeswoman Christine Trimble said that “Apple employs technologies invented by Qualcomm without paying for them.”
* The suits leverage three non-standard essential patents which cover power management and Force Touch technology that Apple uses in its touch screens (they probably mean 3D Touch). Those are, in Qualcomm’s words, a few examples of the “many Qualcomm technologies that Apple uses to improve its devices and increase its profits.”
* The chip maker previously asked US regulators to ban the import of some iPhone models over purported infringement of its patents, considered essential to cellular communication.
* Qualcomm and Apple first locked horns earlier in the year when the iPhone maker leveled an antitrust suit against Qualcomm, alleging unfair licensing practices. The chip giant charges a percentage of the price of each handset regardless of whether it includes its chip.
* Critics say Qualcomm is making sales of its chips conditional on the purchase of a patent license while refusing to make its essential technology available to rival chip makers. The firm apparently charges high royalty rates unless phone vendors agree to buy its chips.
* Apple cut off licensing payments to Qualcomm and asked its suppliers to follow suit. Qualcomm suggested Apple was looking for ways to reduce its costs amid slowing iPhone shipments.
* The move forced Qualcomm to lower earnings forecasts because Apple payments accounted for about $2 billion per year in highly profitable revenue, according to analyst estimates.
* Qualcomm’s CEO previously alluded to a possible out of court settlement. Given the latest legal maneuvering on both sides, any settlement is now in the realm of wishful thinking.
