title: Safari adds DuckDuckGo support in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite
---
* Safari just got a lot more private in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. The web browser on iPhone, iPad and Mac now includes the private search engine DuckDuckGo that users can set as default. For Mac users, this goes alongside an all-new private browsing option that functions like incognito mode on Chrome. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn’t track you, allowing you to browse the web knowing that your privacy is intact…

* DuckDuckGo expressed its gratitude in a recent blog post:
* We are thrilled to be included in Safari and it’s great that Apple is making it easy for people to access our anonymous search option,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This makes DuckDuckGo the first privacy-focused search engine to be added to one of the top four browsers and is a huge milestone for both us and privacy supporters.
* That isn’t the only change that Apple has made to its search engine offerings. The company has set Bing as the default search engine in OS X Yosemite, including in Spotlight search, in what amounts to a cold shoulder against its arch-rival Google. The default search engine on iPhone and iPad is still Google, however, perhaps signalling that Apple isn’t confident enough to make the switch on mobile yet.
* Apple has slowly moved away from integrating Google services as stock features on iPhone and iPad. After its licensing agreement expired with Google in mid-2012, the company removed YouTube as a stock app in iOS 6. Google later reintroduced the app on the App Store. Meanwhile, Apple ditched Google Maps on iOS 6 and turned to its own — highly criticized — in-house Maps solution.
* Have you ever used DuckDuckGo?
