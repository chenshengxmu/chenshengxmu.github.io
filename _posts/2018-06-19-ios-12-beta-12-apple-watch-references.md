* Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo has managed to uncover hidden references to a plethora of unreleased Apple Watch models from the iOS 12 beta 2 developer release.
* Apple today released second betas of the new iOS 12 and watchOS 5 operating systems to developers and Guilherme was able to discover the curious new Apple Watch identifiers:
* They appear alongside the existing Apple Watch Series 3 identifiers, which are:
* These identifiers suggest that a next-generation Apple Watch will be offered in four variants like existing models: 38mm and 42mm, each in Wi-Fi and Cellular+GPS flavors.
* “There are also references to the model numbers corresponding to the new devices, which include MTUD2, MTUK2, MTX92 and many others,” Guilherme wrote. watchOS 5 is releasing this fall and we’re expecting Apple’s usual hardware updates in September so these identifiers could be there to support unreleased devices.
* Apple Watch Series 4 is expected to have a 15% larger display.
* What do you make of this, boys and girls?
* Let us know in the comments!
