* Fueling rumors of a potential Apple TV hardware refresh next month, Apple has apparently instructed its retail employees to start treating Apple TV buyers to $25 iTunes Gift Cards, basically bringing the price of the $99 media-streaming box down to $74.
* Of course, you’re still paying the full price for the Apple TV hardware, Apple is just throwing in a $25 iTunes Gift Card with every new purchase. The credit can be redeemed against any content purchase in the company’s many online stores.
* So in a nutshell, you’re getting a $25 iTunes credit for apps, books, movies, music and more, free of charge. The offer is valid through March 5, 2014…
* Dan DeSilva of 9to5Mac was able to obtain Apple’s internal memo to retail employees.
* Apple TV offers the best content. Now, customers get even more.
* From February 28 to March 5, customer who buy an Apple TV from our stores get a $25 iTunes Gift Card to spend on their favorite content. Spread the word.
* It appears that the promotion is limited to Apple’s retail locations as the online stores don’t get to participate.

* Apple’s job listings point to work on a new Apple TV interface.
* Both Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal claim Apple may be moving forward with “less ambitious” television plans following Netflix’s deal with Comcast.
* The company is said to negotiate with Time Warner Cable and other potential partners to enhance its video offering ahead of the rumored next-gen Apple TV hardware refresh.
* The new hardware is reportedly slated for an announcement by April, ahead of a rumored Christmas launch.
* “The new device, which plugs into a television set, will have a faster processor than the previous version and an upgraded interface to make it easier for customers to navigate between TV shows, movies and other online content”, Bloomberg reported.
* Bloggers have discovered references to an unreleased Apple TV hardware in the iOS 7 code, with one report speculating that the refresh could include upgraded internals, a built-in AirPort wireless router and a possible iOS controller support for downloadable games via an Apple TV App Store.
