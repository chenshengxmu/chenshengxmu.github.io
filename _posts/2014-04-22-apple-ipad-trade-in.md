* Apple’s in-store Reuse & Recycling program in the United States and Canada is now available to iPad owners, too, according to a new report Tuesday.
* If you have a used iPad lying around that needs getting rid of, take it to a nearby Apple Store and the company will give you a store credit, depending on its model, condition, age, physical appearance and other factors.
* Apple uses a list of 22 criteria to evaluate if your device is eligible for trade. Devices that won’t power on, have smashed screens, are jailbroken or use non-Apple parts won’t be considered for a credit…
* This is an extension of Apple’s ongoing in-store Reuse & Recycling initiative that up until today used to include only iPhones and Macs.
* Dan DeSilva has more:
* Also new, Apple will now allow iPhone or iPad trade-in credit to be used on cross products. That means you can trade-in an eligible iPhone and use that credit towards the purchase of a new iPad. Previously, iPhone trade-in credit could only be used to buy a new iPhone.
* Other places such as Gazelle typically offer better deals than Apple so please do your research before turning in your used device with Apple.
* Just yesterday, Apple started offering free recycling of all its devices, completely free of charge, in all of its retail outlets around the world.
* These latest strides are part of a new ‘Better’ campaign designed to highlight the great lengths Apple goes to preserve the environment and “leave the world better than we found it.”
