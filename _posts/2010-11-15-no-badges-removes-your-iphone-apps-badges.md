* Do you hate badges so much that you wish they were gone forever? That sounds a little extreme, but if that’s what you’re into, then there is now a new mod on Cydia that will do exactly what you’re looking for.
* In the same way No Folder Badges removed badges from your iPhone folders, No Badges, a new jailbreak tweak by Chpwn will remove the badges from your homescreen apps. That’s all the app does and from what I can tell it does it well…
* I’m not sure why anyone would want to remove the badges from their homescreen apps, but I’m sure there are valid reasons for that.
* No Badges is available for free in Cydia. Is that something you’d find useful? Why?
