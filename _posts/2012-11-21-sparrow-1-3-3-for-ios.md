* After Apple rejected Sparrow’s iPhone 5 update earlier in the month, critics cried foul and commentators happily pointed out Apple was attempting to derail the popular email client for iOS devices and Macs. There was little hope left for new features after Google acquired Sparrow in June. Plus, the search giant acknowledged as much when it said the Sparrow team would move to Google’s Mountain View offices to work on new Gmail features. It’s a welcome sign, then, that a new version of Sparrow just surfaced on the App Store. Though short of features, it does bring out two major nice-to-haves: support for the iPhone 5’s taller display and Passbook integration…
* Support for Passbook, a new stock app in iOS 6, allows Sparrow to send .pkpass files to the Passbook app.
* These small files are embedded in confirmation email messages when buying tickets, boarding passes, loyalty cards and other items Passbook understands.
* Apart from the iPhone 5 and Passbook support, changelog makes no mention of other tweaks.
* If you don’t have it, Sparrow will run you three bucks on the App Store.
* Confirmed that the Passbook support in Sparrow lets it send .pkpass files to Passbook nicely. thenextweb.com/apps/2012/11/2…

* The program supports all iOS devices natively except iPads.
* Do you still use Sparrow following the Google acquisition?
* I’ve tried lots of different email clients and I still like Sparrow better than any other program. Sure, I miss a feature here and there.
* For example, a Mail-like VIP recipient list would be nice and lack of push support’s been ticking me off.
* But overall, it gets the job done and it does it fast – that’s all I care about in an email client.
