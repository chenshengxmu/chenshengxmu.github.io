* The adoption rate of iOS 9 appears to be stalling at 77 percent of devices, according to the most recent stats published on Apple’s dashboard for developers. The figure was derived from device logs capturing iOS hardware that has accessed the App Store on February 22, and is literally unchanged from the same 77 percent mark recorded two weeks ago.
* iOS 8 continues to comprise seventeen percent of devices while older editions of iOS accounted for six percent of devices—again, same as two weeks ago.
* The numbers indicate that either iPhone sales are slowing, or that owners of existing devices are not updating to iOS 9 as often as before, or both. The iPhone is prone to seasonality so sales typically taper off after the September and December quarters.
* During its most recent earnings call, Apple said its active installed base has passed one billion total iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod touch, Apple TV and Apple Watch devices.
* The most recent adoption rates for Android, captured on February 1, reveal that Android 6.0 Marshmallow now runs on a mere 1.2 percent of Android smartphones and tablets.
* KitKat and Lollipop editions accounted for a combined 69.6 percent of active devices in the wild. Android data was collected during a seven-day period ending on February 1, 2016 by logging devices that have actually visited the Google Play Store app.

* Since the Play store app supports Android 2.2 and above, devices running older versions are not included, nor is included Android hardware powered by forked versions of Android (such as Amazon’s Fire devices) or devices that come preloaded with third-party application stores, like tens of millions of smartphones and tablets sold in China.
