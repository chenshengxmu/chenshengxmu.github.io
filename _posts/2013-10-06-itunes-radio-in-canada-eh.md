* Folks in Canada will be happy to hear that iTunes Radio may soon be landing in the country. A new job listing on Apple’s website calls for a ‘iTunes Canada Music Programmer,’ who will be responsible for rolling out the music service.
* Apple launched iTunes Radio last month alongside the redesigned iOS 7, and thus far it’s only been available in the US. But if this job listing is any indication, the company could soon be rolling out the music service to more countries…
* Here’s the description of the position, first spotted by 9to5Mac:
* “The Canadian Music Programmer will be responsible for the programming of iTunes Radio and the iTunes Music store in Canada. This particular role will report directly to the Head of Music for the Canadian iTunes store, and will be responsible for working cross-functionally across a variety of teams including Editorial, Label Relations, Marketing, Sales, Production & Engineering, and more.
* The Canadian Music Programmer will be an editorial voice of iTunes Radio, and will be responsible for keeping the product current. This person must have a passion for and deep knowledge of music across numerous genres and decades, and must demonstrate the ability to objectively program content relevant to iTunes customers.”
* The job responsibilities will include deciding what music to feature on Radio stations, entering music into the content management system, creating seasonal and relevant editorial collections, and generating incremental music sales.
* In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services Eddy Cue said he has been ‘very pleased’ with iTunes Radio feedback thus far, and he hopes to roll it out internationally as soon as possible.
