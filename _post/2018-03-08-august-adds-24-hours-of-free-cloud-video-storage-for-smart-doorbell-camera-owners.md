* Smart lock maker August announced today that owners of their Doorbell Cam and Doorbell Cam Pro home security cameras will now have access to 24 hours of free cloud video storage.
* August’s basic video recording subscription now allots 24 hours of free video storage to view any moment you may have missed through their iOS app, as well as save the best ones. This free plan comes bundled with any of August’s doorbell cameras.

* The Premium Video Recording plan will up that allotment to 30 days of storage for $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, which is fairly competitive with other cameras like the Ring Video Doorbell 2 (review) or Logi Circle 2 (review).
* August Home CEO Jason Johnson said:
* We believe video recording is such an important feature for video doorbells that we are adding 24 hours of video recording, for free, with both of our Doorbell Cams. Now if you miss a motion notification or experience a porch pirate walking off with a package from your doorstep, you can access and review the stored video from the August app.
* August’s doorbell cams don’t work with HomeKit, but their smart lock (review) does.
* The company has promised HomeKit support coming in the future for its cameras. Speaking of August, the company was acquired in October by Assa Abloy and will continue as a separate organization, but benefitting from additional resources.
* You can learn more about the subscription plans on August’s website.
