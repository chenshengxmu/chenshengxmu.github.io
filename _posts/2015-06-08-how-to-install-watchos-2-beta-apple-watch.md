* Today, Apple unveiled watchOS 2, and it’s a major upgrade to the initial version of watchOS. When you think about it, it’s pretty amazing that we’re getting such improved functionality less than 2 months from the debut of Apple Watch.
* As it usually does on WWDC keynote day, Apple has made its OS updates available for download immediately. If you’re an Apple developer member, a privilege that now extends across all platforms for only $99, you can download and install watchOS 2 today.
* The installation is fairly arduous and time-consuming, but it can be done with relative ease if you have the patience. But I definitely don’t recommend that anyone but a developer does this, because there is no way to downgrade back to watchOS 1.01.
* In this post and video tutorial, we’ll show you what you need to prepare to install watchOS 2, and how to install watchOS 2 on your Apple Watch.
* Note: to download the beta’s you will need to be an Apple Developer
* Step 1: Unpair your iPhone and Apple Watch, if you don’t you’ll need to reset your Apple Watch later and repair it. I personally prefer to reset my Apple Watch to defaults anyway. It’s nice to start with a fresh install for a beta.
* Step 2: Download and install the iOS 9 beta on your iPhone from the Apple Developer portal
* Note: If your iOS device is already registered as a developer device, you should be able to skip this section of the tutorial. Also, the UDID requested is for your iPhone, not your Apple Watch.
* Step 1: Download and install the iOS 9 SDK (Xcode 7 beta) from the Apple Developer portal
* Step 2: Connect your iPhone to your Mac
* Step 3: Launch Xcode 7 beta
* Step 4: Click Window → Organizer
* Step 5: Copy the 40-character UDID in the identifier field
* Step 6: Sign in to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles using your developer-registered Apple ID
* Step 7: Click the + sign to begin registration
* Step 8: Name your device and paste in the UDID from Step 4
* Step 9: Click continue to confirm and complete registration
* Step 1: Pair your Apple Watch
* Step 2: Charge your Apple Watch do that it has at least 50% charge and keep it connected to its inductive charger throughout the installation process
* Step 3: Connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi
* Step 4: Place your iPhone next to your Apple Watch
* Step 5: Download the watchOS 2 beta Configuration from the Apple Developer portal directly to your iPhone
* Step 6: Launch the profile, tap Apple Watch as install location and reboot when asked
* Step 7: Launch the Apple Watch app on iPhone
* Step 8: Tap My Watch → General → Software Update
* Step 9: If requested, enter your passcode
* Step 10: Wait for the Apple logo to appear and watch the progress bar fill in completely
* Step 11: Your Apple Watch will reboot once the update is completed
* That’s all there is to it. You should now be able to enjoy watchOS 2 and all of its perks on your Apple Watch.
* What do you think? Was it easy? Check back, as we’ll have much more coverage of watchOS 2 over the next few days and weeks.
