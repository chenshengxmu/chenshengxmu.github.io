* Visual Studio, an integrated development environment from Microsoft, is coming to the Mac. That’s according to Redmond’s prematurely published and now-deleted press release that TechCrunch spotted Monday. Microsoft’s Xcode of sorts, Visual Studio is used to develop native Windows apps, as well as websites, web apps and Azure-driven cloud services.
* Visual Studio for Mac should be formally announced at the Connect() conference later this week. Microsoft previously brought its cross-platform code editor, Visual Studio Code, to macOS.
* Visual Studio for Mac is very similar to its Windows brethren as Microsoft aims to make it easier for Windows developers to feel right at home on the Mac.
* ￼The user interface is inspired by Visual Studio for Windows, but looks and feels “like a native citizen of macOS,” wrote the Windows giant in the removed press release. As mentioned, Visual Studio Code is also available to Mac developers for times when they don’t need a full integrated development environment, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.
* Be sure to check out Microsoft’s resources on Visual Studio and C# coding with Visual Studio Code to learn more about developing cross-platform apps.
