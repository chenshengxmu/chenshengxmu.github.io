* AllThingsD is reporting that Apple has scheduled its next media event for Tuesday, October 4th. Reportedly, new CEO Tim Cook will be the star of the show, and Apple will unveil the “next iteration” of the iPhone.
* Rumors have been circulating that Apple would announce the next gen iPhone in late-September with an early-October release, but that appears to not be the case. AllThingsD was the source that originally started the October date rumor for the iPhone 5, and now the publication is backing up its claim with a specific date…
* “While Apple could certainly change its plans anytime, sources said that the October 4 date has been selected by the company to showcase the iPhone 5. Sources added that the plan is now to make the new device available for purchase within a few weeks after the announcement.
* And while the iPhone 5 is a much anticipated handset, the event itself has a lot more importance for Apple than many previous ones.”
* Many of us hoped that this iPhone announcement would be Steve Jobs’ swan song on stage in front of the media, but October looks to be all about Apple’s new CEO, Tim Cook. This next event will be the first time that the public gets “a first lengthy impression” of him, and this iPhone announcement will allegedly “set the tone” for his new role at Apple. Cook is set to “preside” over the iPhone 5 rollout.
* AllThingsD does speculate that Steve Jobs could come on stage for “One More Thing…” if his health permits:
* “What will be interesting to see, of course, is if Jobs himself will also make an appearance, which is something that is likely to be determined by his health in a decision that will made very close to the event.
* And while putting Jobs onstage with Cook could diminish the new leader’s first public effort, what better “one more thing” than Jobs himself making a cameo appearance?”
* The iPhone 5 is expected to have an A5 processor, 8 megapixel camera, updated display, and differing form factor. There are still rumors suggesting that a cheaper iPhone model will also be introduced that’s based on the iPhone 4.
* If Apple is in fact ready to hold an event on October 4th, then media invites should be sent out as early as next Monday.
