* Facedown detection stands as one of the underrated features in iOS 9’s rich arsenal of power-saving tactics designed to help extend your run time by up to an additional hour.
* Facedown detection avoids turning the display on when a notification comes in and your phone is put facedown. But as it turns out, Facedown detection doesn’t work on all devices compatible with iOS 9 and there is a good explanation for that  why.
* Gautam Prabhu explains that Facedown requires the M7, M8 or M9 motion co-processors which are found inside the following iOS devices:
* In addition to a motion co-processor, Facedown detection requires the proximity and ambient light sensors, too.
* “Thanks to ambient light and proximity sensors, your iPhone knows if it’s facedown on the table and prevents the screen from turning on, even when you receive a notification,” confirms the iPhone 6s webpage.
* Due to these requirements, Facedown is not supported on the following devices:
* Apple’s motion co-processors were designed to calibrate and poll integrated accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity and compass sensors without waking up the power-hungry main central processing unit (CPU).
* Beginning with the iPhone 6s and iPad Air, Apple’s motion coprocessor is now integrated within the main A9/A9X chip rather than being a separate module. In addition, it’s always on which makes possible untethered ‘Hey Siri’ functionality on these devices.
* iOS 9 employs several energy-saving techniques to extend your run time by up to an hour. In addition to core OS optimizations designed to trim battery use whenever possible, iOS 9 cuts the display power and mutes Lock screen notification alerts when your device is facedown on the table.
* But that’s not all: other power-saving tactics include a new Low Power Mode which gives you up to three hours of additional run time and more granular battery-related options in the Settings app.
* Are you excited about Facedown detection?
