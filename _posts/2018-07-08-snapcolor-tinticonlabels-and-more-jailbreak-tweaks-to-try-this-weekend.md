* There’s been a hiatus in jailbreak tweak development during the spans of time that the community patiently awaited an iOS 11.2-11.3.1 jailbreak tool, but that wait is finally over after the Electra Team delivered Electra1131 to the public on Friday.
* Despite how slow of a week it’s been, we’re dedicated to showing you everything new in Cydia since our previous weekly jailbreak tweak roundup. So without further ado…
* AutoPause11: Automatically pauses media playback when volume is decreased to 0 (free via BigBoss repository – review)
* ByePageHSBouncing: Removes the ‘rubber band’ bounce effect on the Home screen (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* NoSpaceMailCells: Removes the empty space between cells in Apple’s Mail app (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* SnapColor: Lets you colorize the SnapChat app your own way (free via Packix repository)
* TintIconLabels: Lets you colorize your Home screen’s app icon labels (free via BigBoss repository – review)
* Tweetomizer: Lets you customize the Twitter app (free via BigBoss repository)
* That wraps things up for this week’s jailbreak tweak roundup, but remember to stay tuned to iDB throughout the week to stay updated on new releases as they materialize.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup in case you might’ve missed anything. We also have several dedicated roundups to help you find ways to tweak your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
