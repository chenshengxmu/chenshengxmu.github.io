* As expected, Facebook has unveiled a revamped News Feed today. The refresh, which the company says was ‘mobile-inspired,’ will significantly change the way the personalized stream is displayed on your desktop, smartphone and tablet.
* Changes include larger images and videos, the introduction of sub feeds, which will allow you to separate the different content that appears in your feed, and a much more organized interface. More details and a video after the fold…
* Here’s Facebook’s official introductory video “Behind the News Feed Redesign”

* And the obligatory blog post announcement:
* “Today we’re announcing a new version of Facebook designed to reduce clutter and focus more on stories from the people you care about. You see all the stories you saw in your News Feed before, but with a fresh new look. We’ve completely rebuilt each story to be much more vibrant and colorful and highlight the content that your friends are sharing. Photos, news articles, maps and events all look brighter and more beautiful.”
* In addition to the new look, Facebook is introducing four new feeds, or sub feeds, to help organize your content.
* Admittedly, the revamped News Feed looks great—it’s being compared to Google+. And the new sub feeds sound good on paper. But how well will these things translate to real world usage? Facebook has a notoriously skeptical user base.
* Perhaps that’s why it’s announced that it’s going to be rolling the new features out “slowly, and carefully” over the next few weeks. That way, if it receives strong negative user feedback on a particular aspect, it can quickly change or pull it.
* Expect to see the new News Feed in your iPhone and iPad apps within the next month. But for those of you who just can’t wait, you can sign up for the wait list to get a shot at trying the new feature before it becomes available.
* We have to know, what are your thoughts on the new Facebook News Feed? Good, bad, or meh?
