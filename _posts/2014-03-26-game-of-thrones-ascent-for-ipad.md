* If you, too, take part in HBO’s international Game of Thrones phenomenon, the official iPad game’s a no brainer.
* Available now free of charge in the App Store, Game of Thrones Ascent for iPad comes ahead of Season 4 debut, courtesy of developer Disruptor Beam who teamed with Kongregate to bring the game to Apple’s iPad and Android.
* Based on the award-winning HBO show and literary works of George R.R. Martin, the iPad edition improves upon the Facebook and web editions of Game of Thrones Ascent (which already has 2.5 million players) with crisp Retina graphics, Game Center leaderboards, full iOS 7 support and thousands of story-driven quests, regularly updated each Monday with content seen on TV the night before…
* From the developer’s iTunes description:
* The award-winning game based on HBO’s Game of Thrones has come to the iPad! See what 2,500,000 players are already raving about!
* Build your noble house, embark on quests and rise in power in the Strategy RPG based on the hit HBO series Game of Thrones and George R.R. Martin’s novels A Song of Ice and Fire! 
* Set during a time of upheaval within Westeros, the player can participate in countless story-driven quests, take part in Alliance challenges, engage in pacts, diplomatic agreements, marriages and betrothals to earn his or her reputation among the Great Houses and lots more.
* Key features include:

* Looks pretty neat.
* It’s a well-made title and my only complaint is about some ridiculously priced add-ons available as in-app purchases, though the game doesn’t seem to be dependent on them.
* The premiere of HBO’s Game of Thrones Season 4 is only a week away.
* Prepare yourself: winter is coming!
* Grab Game of Thrones Ascent for iPad free in the App Store.
* The download comes in at 94.4MB and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
