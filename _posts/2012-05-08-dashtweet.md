* Dashboard X — the new upcoming widgeting system for iOS — has its first official widget in the works, and it’s based on Twitter.
* Dashtweet is the name of the new widget, and it allows you to send tweets from anywhere on your Home screen.
* This is likely the first of many official widgets designed specifically with Dashboard X in mind. Check out our video coverage of Dashtweet in action…
* Dashtweet is a very simple Widget that performs one specific function — it allows you to send a tweet from wherever you decide to place it on your Home screen. The widget uses iOS 5’s built in Twitter authentication to connect to your Twitter account.
* As of now the widget is still in development, as is the platform it’s based upon. Even still, we can see the potential that Dashboard X brings to the table.
* The developer of Dashtweet has recently updated the widget with the ability to change the color of text, but that’s hopefully the first upgrade in a line of improvements that will make its way to the widget before it hits the public.
* Admittedly, Dashtweet isn’t the most exciting prospect that one might imagine, but as stated, this is only the beginning of what will hopefully be a well supported endeavor within the jailbreak community.
* Thoughts?
