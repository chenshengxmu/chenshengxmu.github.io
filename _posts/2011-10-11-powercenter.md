* Since iOS 5 hits tomorrow, jailbreak developers are starting to update more of their widgets, tweaks and apps to be compatible with Apple’s latest and greatest iOS firmware.
* Along with that, we here at iDB have begun to take a keen notice of what’s available for jailbreakers. Many of the current jailbreak tweaks for iOS 5 are Notification Center widgets, and few are prettier than PowerCenter.
* PowerCenter is a tweak that allows you to quickly respring, reboot, or power down your iPhone with a slide of your finger, and it’s a beauty. Catch the full video walkthrough after the break…
* As you can see, PowerCenter is simple — you can perform the same actions easily with SBSettings, or various other tweaks — but it’s the gorgeous design of the widget that really grabbed my attention.
* PowerCenter is a perfect complement to the linen background that graces Notification Center, and it works without any of the problems that plague some of the other beta widgets available thus far.
* If you want to give PowerCenter a try, add the BigBoss beta repo to your list of Cydia sources: http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/
* Be sure to let me know what you think of PowerCenter in the comment section below.
