* The reinvigorated Yahoo has updated its gorgeous Weather application for the iPhone and iPad, available free of charge in the App Store, with some noteworthy visual enhancements and feature improvements.
* I’ve always absolutely loved how the app presents full-bleed photographs of chosen location(s), sourced from the Flickr community.
* But, there was no way to browse through different photos of the same location. Starting today, you can now simply pull down on the image to load a new one, when possible. Another enhancements, straight from the design department: new animations for moon phases available as you scroll through details…
* On top of the aforementioned design changes, the refreshed app shows wind chill information on the summary screen, with chance of precipitation data having been added to your 5 and 10-day forecasts, too.
* If you don’t like the city’s cover image (left), just pull down on the photo (middle) and the app will load a new one (right).
