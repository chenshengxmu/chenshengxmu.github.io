* Apple has just released their latest betas of iOS 11.3 and tvOS, but without one major feature: AirPlay 2 is now nowhere to be found in the third beta of iOS 11.3 and tvOS 11.3.
* In the first two betas, you could use AirPlay 2 to cast audio to multiple AirPlay 2 devices at the same time. I was able to stream music from my iPhone to two Apple TVs simultaneously.
* Apple TV would also appear inside of the Home app and had a section in AirPlay settings to choose an appropriate HomeKit room.
* All of these features and settings are no longer present in beta 3.

* Personally, this is super disappointing as I’ve been really enjoying AirPlay 2 in prior betas.
* Apple has not set a release date for AirPlay 2, but promised it later this year. With its presence in the initial 11.3 betas, it was expected we’d see AirPlay 2 debut this spring.
* Unfortunately, that may no longer be the case.
* AirPlay 2 will also be bringing multi-room audio and stereo syncing to HomePod.
* What do you think of the disappearance of AirPlay 2? Did Apple have to delay it further?
* Let us know in the comments.
