* Wow…it looks like the inventory for the first round of iPhone 5 pre-orders on Apple’s online store has already been completely exhausted. Now, whenever you try to pre-order, you get a message saying that the iPhone 5 will ship in 2 weeks, instead of arriving on September 21st like it originally stated.
* The question now is, how much will the shipping times continue to increase as the day wears on? We’re barely an hour over the initially availability, and the shipping time is already at two weeks? Either Apple didn’t have enough inventory for demand, or this launch by far exceeds last years iPhone 4S debut.
* What’s your experience been like with ordering? Were you able to successfully grab one?
