* Tomb Raider: Anniversary, the grand reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider video game for the new audience, is now available on the Mac as a $9.99 download in the Mac App Store. Created by Feral Interactive and Square Enix, the game retraces Lara Croft’s original adventure in pursuit of the legendary Scion artifact.
* Tomb Raider: Anniversary is powered by an enhanced graphics engine, dubbed Tomb Raider: Legend, with enhanced physics and animations delivering a fluid experience and bringing life to the game’s massive environments on your Mac.
* You’ll be exploring the lost city of Atlantis and ancient Egyptian pyramids, deftly leap around charging enemies with Lara’s trademark acrobatic gunplay, engage wild creatures and lethal predators such as the awesome T-Rex and Atlantean centaurs.

* “When Lara is hired by a powerful tycoon to retrieve the mythical Atlantean Scion, she embarks on an epic journey around the world to uncharted lands that have remained hidden for centuries,” reads the description.
* “As she unearths long-buried tombs, she discovers that not only has she awoken their mysterious guardians but that there are others desperate to learn the Scion’s dark secrets.”
* And since this is a pure Tomb Raider experience, expect the usual dose of leaping over massive gaps, clinging onto rock ledges, swimming through underground tunnels and much more.
* Check out the full game trailer below.
* The graphically improved gameplay experience should make revisiting the original game’s locations and environments, including classical Greece, ancient Egypt and the lost city of Atlantis, that more fun.
* And if you carefully discover and collect hidden relics, you’ll earn different outfits for the game’s heroine. You can also complete time trials for every level to unlock bonus content and solve puzzles in Lara’s home to uncover its secrets.
