* If you ever wondered whether Apple’s patent infringement claims against HTC were worth the pain, here’s your answer.
* Responding to a recent exclusion order by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) concerning HTC One X and Evo 4G LTE shipments, the Taiwanese handset maker, once the dominant force in the Android camp, is now pre-loading its U.S. phones with an altered build of Android software.
* Designed to bypass Apple patents, it changes the expected behavior of these devices. As a result, flagship HTC phones waiting to be imported into the United States now feature notably different functionality compared to HTC devices shipping elsewhere in the world.
* The change is also impacting the uniformity of the Android experience, suggesting Apple was right to sue in the first place…
* What’s so different about HTC’s custom Android build?
* The Verge explains that HTC’s U.S. devices now include a new App Associations settings screen designed to bypass the offending “data tapping”.
* Specifically, the ITC found that HTC’s messaging app, the stock Android messaging app and the stock Android browser all infringed claims 1 and 8 of Apple patent #5,946,647 — but the ITC also specifically found that Apple’s patent claims were limited to the system both detecting data structures like phone numbers and email addresses in text and then presenting a menu of options when those detected structures are clicked.
* Tapping on a detected phone number or email on both the AT&T One X and the Sprint Evo 4G LTE now immediately launches the dialer or email client.
* On international versions of these handsets a menu pops up, asking users to choose an app to handle these requests, which is the default Android behavior, as seen below.

*  
* HTC customers in the US will now have to go to a new App Associations settings screen to chose their default apps to handle such actions.
* Of course, the ITC still has to verify these changes before it releases the shipments.
* The Commission ruled last December that HTC was infringing upon an Apple patent covering the auto-hyperlinking of phone numbers and other data in text.
* The injunction went into effect on April 18 of this year. As a result, two flagship HTC handsets are now being held at the customs until an approval is secured.
* It’s a small victory for Apple that won’t stop the Android camp from selling a bucketload of devices.
* On the other hand, import bans and court rulings in Apple’s favor are now forcing manufacturers to tweak the Android operating system, possibly affecting affect user satisfaction in the process.
* Besides, Android backers will think twice before slapping Android builds on devices without making significant changes to avoid Apple patents.
* Thoughts?
