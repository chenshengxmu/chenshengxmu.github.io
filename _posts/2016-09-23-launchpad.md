* Reachability, a feature designed by Apple to make it easier to tap on things that normally appear at the top of the screen on iPhones with larger displays, has always been deemed “wasted space” by the jailbreak community.
* Yet another jailbreak tweak release to try making use of that space is Launchpad, which will give you a customizable paginated information system in the Reachability interface.
* After installing Launchpad, you can go to Settings → Launchpad and you’ll find the preferences pane where you can set up the pages that will appear in your Reachability-based information system:

* There are seven pages included with the tweak, but you can include or exclude them based on your tastes. You have the following to choose from:
* Simply drag them in or out of the “Include” or “Do Not Include” headers to enable or disable specific ones. You can also hide or show the page dots, make the Reachability interface automatically hide after being idle for too long, choose a background color, and more.
* Once everything is set up to your liking, you can double-tap on the Touch ID sensor on your device while you’re inside of any app to reveal Reachability and you can start swiping left and right between the information center pages.
* It’s worth noting that Launchpad won’t work from the Home screen at this point in time. The developer is still working on a design that will actually look good on the Home screen, however, so you can expect an update in the future with this feature.
* Additionally, if you have a device that doesn’t support Reachability out of the box, you can use the ReachAll jailbreak tweak to simulate Reachability on your device and Launchpad will still work just fine.
* If you’re interested in trying Launchpad on your jailbroken iPhone, you can pick it up for $2.50 in Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
