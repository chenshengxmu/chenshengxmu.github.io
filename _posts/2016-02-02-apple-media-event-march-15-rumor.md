* Apple is currently planning to hold a media event on Tuesday, March 15, to formally unveil a rumored new four-inch iPhone 5se, a third-generation iPad Air and new Apple Watch band options, according to a report this morning by 9to5Mac’s reliable Mark Gurman.
* “As the scheduled event is still a month-and-a-half away, the date could conceivably still shift or turn into an online announcement,” cautioned Gurman.
* If the rumors are accurate, the iPhone 5se should give customers who prefer smaller form factors something to be excited about. The handset will have a four-inch screen like the iPhone 5s, but run Apple’s in-house designed 64-bit A9 chip.

* Other features in tow for the iPhone 5se: NFC for Apple Pay, enhanced cameras and Live Photos. The device will be priced the same as the iPhone 5s, according to Gurman’s sources, starting at $450 for 16GB (a 64GB model will also be offered).
* As for the iPad Air 3, claimed design drawings suggest the 9.7-inch tablet refresh boasts four speakers and the Smart Connector like the iPad Pro. It could also support the Apple Pencil and have a LED flash on the back.
* First iPad Air 3 case out of China.
