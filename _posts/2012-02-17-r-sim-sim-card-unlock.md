* Even though we are still waiting on an iPhone 4S software unlock from the Dev Team, there are a couple of hardware unlock solutions available. Just last week we told you about the TPSIM SIM interposer, and now another one has surfaced.
* The R-SIM is a turbo SIM card for your iPhone 4S that will unlock your handset, allowing you to use it on any compatible GSM network in the world…
* It looks like your typical SIM interposer. There’s no need to jailbreak your handset or modify your regular SIM card. Just slide your SIM into the R-SIM tray and insert it into your iPhone 4S. Then select your country and carrier, and enter 112 mode — pretty standard stuff.
* The device, however, does have its caveats. For instance, it doesn’t work with 3G networks. So you’ll be limited to slower GPRS browsing speeds while you’re away from Wi-Fi. It’s also worth noting that the R-SIM still says “be the first to review this product” next to it, which is usually a red flag. We always recommend waiting until a credible source has confirmed that a product works as advertised before purchasing it.
* But if that’s not enough to deter you, the R-SIM is available from EachSupplier for $57.99. The shipping is free, and the site says it can get it to you within 2 weeks. Be sure to let us know how it works for you!
* Thanks James
