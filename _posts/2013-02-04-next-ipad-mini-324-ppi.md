* Taking a break from all of the jailbreak excitement this afternoon, we have a new report out of Taiwan claiming that sources close to Apple’s panel suppliers have divulged new information about the next-generation iPad mini.
* The 7.9-inch tablet has been extremely popular for Apple thus far, as supply is just now starting to catch up to demand three months after launch. And if this news is accurate, the next model is going to be an even bigger hit…
* BrightWire, a Chinese investment news service, (via AppleInsider) reports:
* The resolution suggested here makes perfect sense. It’s the only one Apple could use to make an iPad mini ‘Retina’ without causing developers to have to rework their apps, and the panels should scale down just like the iPad 2 panels did.
* It’s also worth noting that AU Optronics builds displays for several Apple products—including the iPad mini. And this isn’t the first report to claim the company is working on Retina mini displays. Here’s one from back in November.
* While some details clash between reports, they all agree that we’re going to see a new iPad mini this year and that it’s going to have a Retina display. The latest speculation has the tablet landing in October alongside a redesigned iPad 5.
