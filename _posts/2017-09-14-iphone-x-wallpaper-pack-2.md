* With an iPhone X OLED display, having incredible wallpapers will be the best way to show off your new device. Yesterday, we posted the first iPhone X wallpaper pack in this mini Wallpapers of the Week exclusive series! Today, we continue the iPhone X wallpaper series with another incredible pack of wallpapers, perfect for the new wide color iPhone X display. Start collecting wallpapers for your new iPhone, right now.
* Answering my Call to Action, iDB reader and aspiring designer @danielghuffman searched the archives of unsplash.com to find quality content. Putting together a pack of vivid images, he scaled them to 1,750 x 3000. The resolution of the iPhone X is slightly smaller than that at 1125 x 2436, giving you a little wiggle room for parrallax.
* We really appreciate @danielghuffman for taking the time to create an amazing set, which you can download below. Visit his online gallery for more artistic works and stay tuned for tomorrow’s iPhone X Wallpaper Pack 3, also a collaboration with Daniel!
* If you find any iPhone X wallpapers or want to be alerted of my findings and upcoming posts, follow along via @jim_gresham. I communicate with our Wallpaper of the Week fans, collect submissions for the site, and send out images throughout the week! Another iPhone X wallpaper pack is yet to come. Follow along to be the first to know.
