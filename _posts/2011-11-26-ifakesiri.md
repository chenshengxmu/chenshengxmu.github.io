* Since Siri is turning into the biggest thing to hit the internet since cats playing pianos, it was probably inevitable that someone would get around to making an easy way to fake Siri screenshots, and it has finally happened.
* By offering a simple interface, the iFakeSiri web app allows self-professed comedians to enter their imaginary Siri conversations and have a fake screenshot created. This is perfect for, say, anyone that needs to write blog posts about Apple’s fancy assistant technology!
* Just to add a little more control to how your screenshot turns out, iFakeSiri even allows you to choose which carrier you want to be displayed. Unfortunately, the only three options right now are for the US carriers of Sprint, AT&T and Verizon, but we’re hopeful international carriers will get added, too.
* It has to be said that most people will file this under the “absolutely pointless” folder, but for us, it’s one of those awesome little web apps that brightens up our dark and lonely days.
* Go on, you know you want to sit and make Siri come up with all kinds of things, don’t you?
