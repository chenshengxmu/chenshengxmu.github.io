* Golden Tee fans rejoice, Incredible Technologies is bringing the popular arcade golf game to iOS this year. As noted by TouchArcade, the team has been quietly showing off a demo version of the game at this year’s Game Developers Conference (or GDC).
* For those of you not familiar with Golden Tee, it’s the golf game you’ve seen in the corner of virtually every bar ever. It’s an in-depth golf game with beautiful graphics, easy-to-learn controls and the arcade version utilizes a track ball for swing/ball direction.
* IT says that Golden Tee for iOS will use a similar control scheme, but instead of rolling a giant track ball around, you’ll swipe across your screen. You’ll also be able to import your data from your current Golden Tee profile, which should be a huge boon for fans.
* The game is still in very early stages, so we weren’t able to find any video of it in action. But the team clearly thinks that they can have it completed within the next six months, as it’s been telling media at the GDC that they’re planning for a ‘summer’ launch.
