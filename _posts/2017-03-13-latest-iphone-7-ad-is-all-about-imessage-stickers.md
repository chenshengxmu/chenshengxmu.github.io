* Apple on Monday via its YouTube channel shared a brand new television commercial for iPhone 7, titled “Sticker Fight”. Much like its September 2016 “Balloons” ad, the most recent 60-second video takes another iOS 10 iMessage feature to the real-world: sticker packs. “Say it with stickers on iPhone 7,” reads the tagline. Apple also created a new App Store section where you can download all of the stickers featured in the ad.
* Here’s the new “Sticker Fight” ad.
* “You’ve seen the commercial, now get the stickers packs. Within moments, your messages will be more silly, stylish and fun. Trust us, your friends will thank you,” says App Store.
* Browse the new “Say it with stickers” section on App Store.
* How do you like Apple’s new ad about iOS 10 Messages stickers? And which one do you like better, “Balloons” or “Sticker Fight”?
