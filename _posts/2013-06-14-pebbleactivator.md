* I’m not a Pebble watch owner, but if I was, I’d be all over this like white on rice. PebbleActivator is a new jailbreak tweak from iOS developer Ryan Petrich, and it allows you to execute specific commands via the Pebble Smart watch’s physical buttons.
* PebbleActivator is basically an Activator add-on, as it runs inside of the Activator app. With that said, the app does feature its own standalone app icon for interfacing with its settings. Take a look inside for a few more details, and why this new tweak is so handy for Pebble watch owners.

* What are some of the cool things you could possibly do with PebbleActivator? The list is basically limitless, but you could do things like Activate Siri, Take a Screenshot, launch apps, or a whole host of other features.
* If you’re a Pebble watch owner with a jailbroken iOS device, why not give the new PebbleActivator app a try? You can find it by heading adding Ryan Petrich’s beta repo: http://rpetri.ch/repo/ to your Cydia sources, and downloading for free.
