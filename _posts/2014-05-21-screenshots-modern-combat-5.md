* It’s been nearly a year since we first saw a preview of Gameloft’s Modern Combat 5, and the game has yet to see a release date. In fact, we’ve heard almost nothing about the title in the past 11 months, leading some folks to believe that the project had either been shelved or canceled.
* But that has certainly changed in the last few weeks. In late April, Gameloft offered up new details about the game, and a week later it broke down its new unified progression system. And today, it posted a pair of beautiful new screenshots showing Modern Combat 5 in action…

* In addition to posting the new screenshots, Gameloft gave select gaming sites hands-on demos of the new Modern Combat. Touch Arcade says that the game plays a lot like Modern Combat 4—and that’s not necessarily a bad thing—but notes that the graphics are a ‘big step up.’
* Modern Combat 5: Blackout begins in Venice, Italy, where the main character Phoenix has been sent on a special mission to secure a transport of dangerous weapons from a very well-armed terrorist group. From there the plot will take gamers on a journey around the globe.
* Unfortunately, we still don’t have a specific release date, but Gameloft does say it’ll have more information to reveal at the E3 gaming expo next month. Also, for those interested, the developer will be hosting a live stream on their Twitch channel tomorrow starting at 1PM EST.
