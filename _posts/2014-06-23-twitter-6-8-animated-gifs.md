* Last Wednesday, the micro-blogging platform Twitter started rolling out native support for animated GIFs to its mobile apps for iOS and Android, as well as to its web interface available on Twitter.com.
* Initiaily, the free iPhone and iPad app didn’t gain the feature at the time of the announcement as the firm needed more time to implement animated GIFs on backend side.
* This morning, Twitter version 6.8 has surfaced in the App Store featuring – you guessed right – the ability to upload animated GIFs from your iPhone and iPad and view them rendered inline, right inside your timelines…
* Native support means your animated GIFs are now shared through the same pic.twitter.com links as native image uploads, as opposed to having to use third-party animated GIF sharing services like Giphy.
* Here’s an example tweet with the embedded GIF, via The Next Web writer Nick Summers.
* It’s a GIF! http://t.co/MyGBncnuTZ

* Just as the above animated GIF plays inline on your computer, updating to Twitter’s latest iOS app will render it right inside your timeline on the iPhone and iPad.
* In addition to support for animated GIFs, Twitter 6.8 includes unspecified “minor improvements” and the following additions to #WorldCup:
* Twitter has said that animated GIFs are supported on the API level so it’s only a matter of time before your favorite third-party client supported these popular image files inline.
* A post over at the Twitter Developers blog reveals that the service currently accepts animated GIFs of up to three megabytes in size.
* Download Twitter 6.8 free in the App Store.
* The universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.0 or later.
* Twitter seems to have neglected its Mac app: the software hasn’t received an important update since last December.
