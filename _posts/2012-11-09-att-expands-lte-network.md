* AT&T announced that it was going to be once again expanding its LTE network yesterday. The rollout brings the high speed data connection to Little Rock, Arkansas, and increases its availability in Bakersfield, California and other markets. So if you just picked up an iPhone 5 or other LTE device on AT&T, here’s the new coverage areas…
* In addition to these areas, we’ve also been informed by a reader that AT&T has activated LTE in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area of Minnesota. Obviously, we have no way of confirming this. But the carrier did promise earlier this year that it would bring LTE to Minnesota’s capital by the end of 2o12.
* As far as overall coverage, AT&T says that its LTE network is now live in 81 markets, covering somewhere around 140 million people in the US. It hopes to add another 10 million to that by the end of year. It’s still miles behind Verizon though, who is in over 400 markets with LTE, and said yesterday it hopes to be done by mid-2013.
* AT&T also announced yesterday that it was going to be changing its policy on iOS 6’s FaceTime over Cellular feature, allowing more LTE subscribers to use the video chatting service, and its new tablet subsidy offer. Customers can now purchase tablets, including the iPad, at $100 discount with a two year data plan contract.
