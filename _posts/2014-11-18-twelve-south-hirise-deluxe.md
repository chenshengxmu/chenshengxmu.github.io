* Premium accessory vendor Twelve South today took the wraps off a Deluxe edition of its famed iPhone and iPad dock for charging and hands-free use.
* The high-end HiRise Deluxe versatile stand ships with color-matched ‘Made for iPhone’ Lightning and micro-USB cables to charge iPads and iPhones.
* The stand can dock your devices in battery cases, such as the Mophie Juice Pack, thanks to its height-adjustable clips, with one-handed adjustment for cases. The HiRise Deluxe is available in three color options, including an all-new gold finish to complement your gold iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3.
* The stand elevates your iOS device to eye level while keeping power connected and charging. It’s awesome for making hands-free FaceTime calls, enjoying your movies, photos and other media.
* Again, ‘Made for iPhone’ Lightning and micro-USB cables are included so you can continue to carry your original cable everywhere you go.

* In addition to the color-matched cables and connectors, the HiRise Deluxe now has a machined dial to change support depth when switching cases or devices, features no-tool assembly and doesn’t block the iPhone or iPad’s headphone ports.
