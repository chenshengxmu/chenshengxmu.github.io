* Sunrise, the popular alternative to Apple’s stock iOS Calendar, today refreshed its nicely done iPhone and iPad application with push for Google Calendars, the search feature and Todoist integration, the company noted in a blog post Wednesday.
* A long-overdue feature, search is finally available in Sunrise to let you sift through your past or future events by title, location and attendees.
* Push is now available for Google Calendars and fans of Todoist will appreciate Sunrise’s integration with this popular task manager for personal productivity.
* Sunrise is available free in the App Store and Mac App Store. Against all odds, Sunrise the company has raised over a whopping $8 million in funding thus far. Not too shabby for a calendar app, wouldn’t you say?
* To access search, just pull down on the upper calendar view.

* Real-time push for Google Calendar is awesome and should help Sunrise gain acceptance in corporate environments. It’s pretty seamless: make a change on, say, Sunrise Desktop and your events will get pushed in real-time to Sunrise for mobile.
* Developers claim that Sunrise is “the only calendar on iOS to support push for Google Calendar”. To use this feature, you’ll need to enable push-notifications for Sunrise.
* As for Todoist integration, upping authorizing Sunrise to use your Todoist account you’ll be able to get all your tasks on the service.
