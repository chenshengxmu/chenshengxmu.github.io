* You will soon be able to buy a Milanese Loop band in gorgeous Space Black finish to complement your Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch case. As spotted by 9to5Mac, the company’s Czech Online Store briefly published a new page for the Space Black Milanese Loop band, but it’s since been pulled indicating the company probably leaked this band option for Apple Watch buyers prematurely.
* Although the link is still accessible, it redirects to Apple’s webpage that provides existing stainless steel options. The now-removed webpage listed only a 42mm option for the Space Black Milanese Loop. If the leaked press images are an indication, the new option should resemble Apple’s Space Black Link Bracelet in color and style.
* The product also surfaced briefly on the Apple Online Store in Portugal and Hungary before being pulled.
* Last year, Apple introduced several new color options for the Apple Watch Sport Band. And in select Asian countries, Apple will be selling exclusive Apple Watch Sport band designs in dark red to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
