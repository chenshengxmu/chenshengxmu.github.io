* The iPhone 5c became available for pre-order at 12:00 am PST this morning. Since then, hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people around the globe have placed orders for the new handset with Apple or one of its retail partners.
* And for the most part, launch day supplies have held up. Last year, it only took an hour for iPhone 5 shipping times to slip on certain models. But this year, most configurations of the iPhone 5c remain available 10 hours after launch…
* Supplies in Hong Kong were the first to fall, with shipping times dropping to to 1-2 weeks around 6 am this morning. Canada’s Apple store is showing similar shipping times, with every 5c model saying ‘ships between 9/20 and 9/24.’
* Sprint is also showing signs of weakness, telling customers that “because of high demand” some phones could ship in to 2 weeks. The most popular configuration appears to be the unlocked yellow 16GB, which is sold out in most stores.

* Apple is offering the 16GB iPhone 5c on most carriers for $99 with a new two-year contract, and it’s $199 for the 32GB. The unlocked GSM version of the 16GB handset is going for $549, and the 32GB version of the 5c is going for $649.
* The iPhone 5c is being sold this year alongside the iPhone 5s—it’s the first time Apple has offered two new handsets. The 5s, however, isn’t up for pre-order, and won’t be available for purchase online or in retail stores until September 20.
