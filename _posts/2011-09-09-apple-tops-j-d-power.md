* J.D. Power has ranked Apple as the top smartphone vendor in customer satisfaction, again. In the latest report for its semi-annual survey, Apple has placed above HTC in customer satisfaction, and also scored better than any other mobile company across the board.
* This survey would be Apple’s sixth consecutive win with J.D. Power. Count ’em: six.
* “For smartphones, the key factors are: performance (35%); ease of operation (24%); features (21%); and physical design (20%).
* For a sixth consecutive time, Apple ranks highest among manufacturers of smartphones in customer satisfaction. Apple achieves a score of 838 and performs well in all factors, particularly in ease of operation and features. HTC (801) follows Apple in the smartphone rankings.”
* Good job, Apple.
