* With the release of iOS 5, we’ve been asked by a bunch of Gevey unlockers if it was safe or not to update to the latest operating system.
* Truth be told, I do not use the Gevey SIM unlock, so I wasn’t really able to help until a user pointed out the obvious to me: it works as long as you preserve your baseband…
* We published two posts today showing you how to do just that. By using either Sn0wBreeze or RedSn0w, you can update to iOS 5 while preserving your baseband, making sure that you can still use your Gevey SIM unlock. See our Sn0wBreeze tutorial and our RedSn0w guide for detailed instructions and videos.
* Thanks ic0dex for the video:
* If you don’t use the Gevey SIM unlock, but use UltraSn0w, the same applies to you. You can upgrade while preserving the baseband, but you will have to wait for the Dev Team to release an update to UltraSn0w, which is supposedly coming tomorrow.
* As always, you’re invited to share questions or experiences in the comment section below. Hopefully this can help figure out the whole situation.
