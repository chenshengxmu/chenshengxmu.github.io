* Algoriddim launched Vjay for the iPad back in June. The videoscratching program impressed us with Retina graphics, support for external hardware such as Griffin’s DJ cable or Numark’s iDJ Live controller, wireless AirPlay streaming and on-the-fly mixes that really take advantage of the iPad’s GPU.
* If you liked the iPad version, you’ll be delighted to know that Vjay is now available on your iPhone and iPod touch as well. The software is remarkably snappy and powerful. By the way, Algoriddim’s even more stunning app for DJs is temporarily free on the iPhone (it normally costs ten bucks) so make sure to download it if you haven’t already.
* I’d bet my shirt that just a few years back you’d never thought a cell phone in your pocket would double as your video mixing machine, letting you mix and scratch your iTunes music videos or compose your own mash ups by combining songs and video from your library in glorious 1080p, at thirty frames per second…
* That’s exactly what Vjay for iPhone does: it transforms your device into a portable mashup machine. This isn’t your parent’s video editor, mind you. Vjay contains a bunch of audio and video effects, looping tools and visual transitions that all work in real-time.
* You can even save your video mashups in real-time, as you’re mixing them. Combine that with wireless video beaming via AirPlay and you’ve got yourself a nice little system for on-the-fly VJing while your audience enjoys your mashups on the big screen.
* The application works in both portrait and landscape and features iTunes Store integration so you can browse, search, preview and purchase music videos from iTunes right inside the app.
