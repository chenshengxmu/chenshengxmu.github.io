* CustomStatusBar is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to customize the status bar in iOS 8. Customization is limited to hiding items, but in a future update you will be able to rearrange items in the status bar as well.
* We’ve taken CustomStatusBar for a spin on video, and we’ll show you how easy it is to clean up your iOS status bar in seconds.
* Once you install CustomStatusBar, you’ll need to venture to the stock Settings app in order to configure the tweak’s preferences. Once there, you can use the toggle switches to disable specific status bar items of your choosing.
* Unfortunately, you will have to perform a respring in order to enact the changes. The good news is that there is a respring button located within the tweaks preferences.

* After respringing, you’ll immediately notice the changes take place in your iPhone’s status bar. It’s always a little surprising how much of a difference a clean status bar can make on the overall look of your phone. I used to be a big fan of a similar tweak called CleanStatus back in the iOS 6 days, and this tweak helps me remember why.
* CustomStatusBar is a free download for jailbroken users on iOS 8. It will also, according to the description in Cydia, play nice with jailbroken devices running iOS 7 in a future update.
