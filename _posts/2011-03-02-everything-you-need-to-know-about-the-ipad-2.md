* Today, Apple announced the next generation of the iPad. The iPad 2 is the next stage in Apple’s tablet evolution, and the device boasts a significant redesign from its predecessor.
* There’s a lot that’s new about the iPad 2. It’s thinner, lighter, and 2x faster than the original iPad. It also borrows elements from the iPhone 4, including dual cameras for FaceTime.
* Let’s take a closer look…

* Apple designed a new Smart Cover for the iPad 2. The design works with a magnetic strip in the iPad that wakes the device to and from sleep when the cover is used. The Smart Cover looks amazing, and the choice of color and material for the screen cover are extensive.

* In conjunction with next Friday’s iPad 2 launch, Apple will be releasing iOS 4.3 for all GSM-based iDevices on March 11th. Apple made it clear that 4.3 would only be coming to the GSM iPhone, so Verizon users will have to wait a little longer. (I foresee a pattern here.)
* Read our iOS 4.3 article to learn more about Apple’s 4.3 announcement.
* Joshua Topolsky of Engadget has posted a hands-on video of the iPad 2:
* Engadget also has a great photo gallery of the iPad 2 from Apple’s demo room at today’s event.
