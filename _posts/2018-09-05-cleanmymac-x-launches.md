* Ten years ago, MacPaw launched CleanMyMac. To celebrate this anniversary, the company has now introduced CleanMyMac X. Featuring an all-new design, the software update includes new features, a speed increase, and more.
* First introduced in 2008, CleanMyMac makes it simple to remove unwanted files and clean up disk space on macOS devices. At the heart of the system is Smart Scan, which analyzes and optimizes your device with a single click. MacPaw says this year’s Smart Scan is three times faster than its previous version.
* In CleanMyMac X, MacPaw has introduced a malware removal tool that automatically checks your system for vulnerabilities and removes malicious files. There’s also an updater, which monitors for updates for software found on your machine, so you’re always using the latest version.
* Other features include:
* I’ve been using CleanMyMac for many years and continue to be amazed by each update. No doubt, this year’s version is the best to date, and it comes highly recommended.

* You can purchase CleanMyMac through a yearly subscription, one-time purchase, or through a Setapp subscription. For those who bought CleanMyMac 3 between Aug. 5 and Sept. 5, MacPaw is offering a free one-year subscription to CleanMyMac X. There’s also an upgrade discount for those who wish to make a one-time purchase. You can also try CleanMyMac X before you buy.
* CleanMyMac X works on macOS 10.10 and later, including the soon-to-be-released macOS Mojave.
* Do you use CleanMyMac? What do you think?
