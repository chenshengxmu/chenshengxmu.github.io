* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Sago Mini Road Trip. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to download the popular children’s title on both iPhone and iPad for free, a solid savings of $3.
* In Sago, kids play as Jinja the cat as they set out on a road trip. There are more than 10 vehicles and 6 destinations to choose from, and no rules or time pressures to worry about. So kids can relax, hit the road and explore at their own pace.
* From the App Store Editors’ notes:
* Road trips are all about making memories while you travel—and it’s hard to forget driving a car made of a pickle. This lively educational app lets youngsters take their own silly road trips, complete with wacky cars and colorful rest stops. Like the other Sago Mini games, it’s an absolute delight and creating fun-filled stories is a blast for all ages.
* And a clip showing the game in action:
* Sago Mini Road Trip is available in the App Store for free for a limited time.
