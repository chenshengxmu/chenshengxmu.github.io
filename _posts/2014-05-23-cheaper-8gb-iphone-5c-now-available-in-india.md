* Following the phasing out of the four-year-old iPhone 4 in India earlier this month after re-launching the handset in January, Apple has now officially brought its cheaper iPhone 5c model with eight gigabytes of storage to the 1.24 billion people country, one of the emerging BRIC (Brazil/Russia/India/China) markets.
* According to local reports, the 8GB iPhone 5c has replaced the aging iPhone 4 as one of Apple’s most affordable handsets, starting at Rs 33,500 (approximately $574) after a cash discount of Rs 4,000 (about $68) and a wireless service contract…
* By comparison, the iPhone 4 used to be the only Apple handset that retailed below Rs 20,000 in India (about $342). The Times of India has more on the iPhone 5c prices and terms of purchase:
* While the phone’s MRP is Rs 37,500, Apple is offering a cash discount of Rs 4,000. This brings down the phone’s price to Rs 33,500. Apple is also giving a case worth Rs 2,000 with the phone. However, Apple informs that it’s a limited period offer.
* The 16GB variant is available for Rs 41,900 (circa $716), but a cash discount of Rs 2,100 (approximately $36) brings the price down to Rs 39,800, or about $682.
* The iPhone 5c has arrived alongside the flagship iPhone 5s last September.
* The colorful handset was meant to address mid-segment of the market, but was heavily criticized over its high asking price of $549/649 for the 16/32GB off-contract variant.
* The device is tough to sell because for just a $100 more people can instead pick up the latest iPhone 5s with the speedy A7 chip with M7 motion coprocessor, an improved camera system with dual-tone flash, better build quality and of course Touch ID.
* Responding to complaints, Apple introduced a cheaper 8GB iPhone 5c to cater to mid-tier markets where “LTE is becoming more established,” as Apple put it. The 8GB handset is available in more than two dozen markets around the world, though it has yet to hit U.S. shores.
