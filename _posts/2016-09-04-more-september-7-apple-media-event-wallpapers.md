* Last week, Apple sent media invitations for the upcoming September 7th event, assumedly announcing the iPhone 7. The newest flagship device is expected to hold the same form factor as the previous two iPhone generations, with marked improvement to the cameras, waterproof capabilities, and the audio experience. But, you will need to decide for yourself if losing the 3.5mm headphone jack is truly an ‘improvement.’
* The media event invitation always causes a flurry of excitement across the wallpaper sphere. Repeatedly, iDownloadBlog’s most popular wallpaper posts center around media events and device launches. Our Wallpapers of the Week section aims to curate images that are chronologically relevant or just awesome walls! Step inside to see one final collection of September 7 event wallpapers.
* The following collection is an original set of wallpapers by digital artist @AR72014. You can find his inspired, original creations below for the upcoming event. If you are hoping to add more of his awesome wallpapers to your device, download his self-titled app, AR7, which I keep on my personal device.
