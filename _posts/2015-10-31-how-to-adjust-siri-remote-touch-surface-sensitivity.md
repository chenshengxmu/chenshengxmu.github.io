* The new Apple TV ships with Apple’s dramatically enhanced Siri Remote with a dedicated trackpad-like area, officially referred to as the Touch surface. In addition to making a clicking sound when pressed to highlight an item, you can swipe left, right, up or down on the Touch surface to navigate the interface, and much more.
* Should you find that default touch sensitivity isn’t working for you, worry not for tvOS lets you customize the sensitivity of the Siri Remote to match your particular control style.
* In this tutorial, we’ll detail personalizing the Siri Remote to your liking by adjusting the sensitivity of its Touch surface.
* Step 1: Go to Settings → Remotes and Devices → Touch Surface Tracking.
* Step 2: You can now choose between two modes of tracking: Fast and Slow. Setting tracking to Fast will require smaller thumb movements to move farther on the Apple TV screen. If you choose Slow, you’ll make larger movements to move a smaller distance.
* The remote’s Touch surface is used in many places throughout tvOS.
* In addition to navigating the interface by swiping, you can also press and hold the Touch surface to enter an alternate character with the on-screen keyboard, swipe across the characters to highlight one, press the Touch area to select an item and more.
* And when you’re in the task switcher (invoked by double-pressing the Home button on the remote), you can force-quit the selected up by swiping up.
