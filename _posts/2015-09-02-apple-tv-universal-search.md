* Following a recent report by 9to5Mac’s reliable blogger Mark Gurman that a fourth-generation Apple TV will cost between $149 and $199, BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski has corroborated that information, adding that the set-top box will also include a universal search feature.
* Billed as another tentpole feature, universal search will allow owners of the forthcoming set-top box to search for a show or movie once “and see results from all sorts of different sources.”
* Not only will this feature support searching Apple’s own iTunes Store but also other content sources and multiple streaming video services at once.
* “Instead of searching the catalogs of multiple video services one-at-a-time for a particular movie, you’ll now be able to search all — or most of them — at once and then choose the service on which you’d like to watch it,” reads the report.
* The article goes on to explain that users will be permitted to search for content by actors and directors, “and run other more targeted searches as well — all with Siri” and with a little help from a content searching engine called Matcha, the video discovery startup Apple acquired back in 2013.
* If true, this will be a remarkable improvement over the current state of things.
* I love my Apple TV and am using it every day, but navigating the interface has become a cumbersome affair due to tons of icons piling up on the Home screen following each new software update.
* I’m using Apple’s Remote app for navigating the Apple TV and text entry but the ability to use natural language spoken commands to sift through mountains of content will be Godsent.
* The Apple TV should be announced alongside new iPhones and iPads at Apple’s media event next Wednesday. The device is said to be powered by a faster A8 processor with more storage, run iOS 9, include a dedicated App Store with third-party app and game downloads and feature a revamped remote.
* The new remote reportedly has Bluetooth connectivity, dedicated Home and Siri buttons, a touchpad area, a bunch of sensors and built-in mic with “some pretty hardcore voice control,” as per BuzzFeed’s sources who are in position to know such things.
* Other sources speculated that Apple will position the new set-top box as a viable alternative to dedicated game consoles. The company is reportedly mulling original content production like Netflix and Amazon for its rumored online-only subscription television service.
