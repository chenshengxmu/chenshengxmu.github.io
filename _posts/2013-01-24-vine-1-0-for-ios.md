* The popular micro-blogging service, Twitter, Thursday launched a brand new iPhone and iPod touch app called Vine. Twitter also officially confirmed it has acquired the startup behind Vine. Little wonder that it’s hailing the new software as “the best way to see and share life in motion”.
* In a nutshell, the app lets you capture and share 6-second looping videos in a simple manner and share them with your friends and family. It supports the iPhone 3GS and higher and iOS 5 or later, is optimized for the iPhone 5 and can be downloaded from the App Store right now, free of charge. Go past the fold for more info…
* According to the Vine blog, posts on Vine are about abbreviation:
* They’re little windows into the people, settings, ideas and objects that make up your life. They’re quirky, and we think that’s part of what makes them so special.
* One doesn’t need a Twitter account to use Vine (you can sign up via email). Of course, users can tweet out their short clips via Twitter, just like Sebastien did.
* The clips will even play inline via Twitter Cards.

* Worth mentioning, Sebastien doesn’t seem to like the initial release because the clips just play all the time without you asking them to start playing so that’s something that may or may not be addressed in a future update.
* Your release notes:
* • unlimited uploads and free • instantly post videos on Vine, then share to Twitter and Facebook (more coming soon!) • find, follow, and interact with people close to you • explore trending posts, featured hashtags and editor’s picks • and so much more
* Two more screenies.

* For now, Vine is an iPhone exclusive, but Twitter confirmed they will be bringing the software to other mobile platforms pretty soon.
* So, who wants to share 6-second videos?
