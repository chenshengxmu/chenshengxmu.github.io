* As Electronic Arts is gearing up to release the PC version of Sims 4 on September 2 , the latest installment in its iconic life simulation game, Aspyr Media has now released the ultimate Sims 2 collection pack on the App Store.
* Featuring all of the content from the original game, in addition to six expansion packs and three ‘Stuff Packs’ never before packaged together, The Sims 2: Super Collection can be exclusively purchased through the Mac App Store as a $29.99 digital download.
* The game has been rewritten from the ground up with modern hardware in mind, featuring a new renderer and support for native resolutions. As a cherry on top, you can import a neighborhood from SimCity 4 Deluxe, play around with custom content via the ‘Body Shop’ and much more…
* The download includes the following The Sims 2 expansion packs and Stuff Packs:
* Aspyr writes:
* In The Sims 2: Super Collection, take your Sim from cradle to grave through life’s greatest moments. Create your own houses, neighborhoods, Sims, and even family dynasties — then watch it all come to life.
* You may choose to manage your Sims so they experience the rewards of a life well lived. Of course, you may also choose to neglect their needs, indulge in their fears, and see what happens. The possibilities are endless.
* Here’s the original Sims 2 trailer.
* The Body Shop and Package Installer are not bundled with The Sims 2: Super Collection and can be downloaded for free from GameAgent.com.
* A GameAgent membership and an active copy of The Sims 2: Super Collection from the Mac App Store is required to download and use these programs.
* Moreover, most of your custom content created in The Body Shop and Package Installer works across both Windows PC and Mac, regardless of which platform it was created on, with a few exceptions.
