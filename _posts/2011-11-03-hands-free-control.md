title: Hands-Free Control Will Allow You to Invoke Siri By Voice

* Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invoke Siri without pressing and holding your Home button?
* I’ve always thought that Apple should include such an option for when we’re on the road and want to control our devices with Siri.
* That’s the concept behind a new jailbreak tweak entitled Hands-Free Control. Once the iPhone 4S jailbreak is made public, it will allow you to invoke Siri by voice alone.
* In the meantime, though, you can invoke Voice Control on pre-iPhone 4S devices…
* Since I don’t have a jailbroken iPhone 4S, I was forced to take the ho-hum Voice Control route. It’s decent, but it’s no Siri. Hands-Free Control worked reasonably well, especially when its settings were calibrated correctly.
* The keyword for invoking the voice control is “Siri” and most of the time it worked as expected with the right settings.
* You’ll definitely run into trouble if you make the keyword recognition too loose or too strict, so configure accordingly.
* I also noticed that it had a hard time picking up my voice when music was playing. Granted, I did use an iPod touch for my testing, and it doesn’t have a microphone like you’ll find on the iPhone.
* All in all, I think this will be quite the compelling tweak once the iPhone 4S jailbreak drops sometime in the (hopefully) near future. What do you think?
