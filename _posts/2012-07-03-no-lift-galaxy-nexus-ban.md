* Just 24 hours after denying Samsung’s motion to stay the Galaxy Tab injunction, Judge Lucy Koh has rejected the company’s request to lift the ban on the Galaxy Nexus.
* As it stands, Samsung will be forced to stop selling both the tablet and handset in the United States, unless the Court of Appeals steps in. But Google has a plan…
* AllThingsD reports:
* “Google isn’t taking a sales ban on the Galaxy Nexus lying down. First and foremost, Samsung and Google have a software patch that they believe avoids infringing the Apple patent that led to the injunction. The patch is expected to be pushed out imminently, Google said.”
* This lines up with previous reports that Google was looking to team up with Samsung, in a move to help the company fight off Apple’s onslaught of lawsuits.
* It’ll be interesting to see how quickly the two companies can roll out the software patch, and if it will effectively reverse the ban. Remember, HTC did the same thing months ago, and it’s still fighting Apple over the patents.
