* If you’re something of a number guy like Apple’s Time Cook, there’s no better way to catch up on the latest stock quotes, company trends and breaking financial news than Yahoo’s excellent Finance service, available on the web and mobile.
* I mean, even Apple’s own Stocks uses Yahoo as a data source. Today, the Internet company has pushed a new update to its free Finance iOS app.
* It’s got a brand new look, introduces real-time pre and after-market data, offers built-in financial news and more…
* The iOS/Android app has been redesigned from the ground up for a much cleaner appearance, but without dumbing it down. Trust me, I’m an avid user of Yahoo Finance!
* On the iOS side, it now delivers real-time stock quotes on the iPhone and iPad. I’m a huge fan of another smart feature: now all the stocks and companies you follow automatically get their own personalized newsfeed to ensure you’re always kept in the loop.
* “Everything updates in real time, giving you a quicker, more seamless experience on the go,” notes Yahoo in a blog post.

* As for a new News tab, it collates relevant news stories from Yahoo Finance.
* Speaking of which, Apple’s Stocks app also includes financial headlines via Yahoo Finance – just swipe to the left on the stock chart in the bottom half of the screen to reveal them.
* Built-in News in Yahoo Finance for iOS typically includes stories about interest rates, the latest on housing prices, quarterly earnings and similar content that appeals to the number crunchers out there.
* Changelog mentions the following improvements:
