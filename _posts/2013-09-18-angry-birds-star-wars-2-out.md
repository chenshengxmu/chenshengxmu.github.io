* Good news for those looking for a good way to kill some time while iOS 7 downloads, there’s a new Angry Birds game out. Rovio has just released Angry Birds Star Wars II, and it’s now available for download in the App Store.
* Like the first installment, the game is based on the “Star Wars” movies, and allows players to join either the Pork Federation or the “Pork Side.” There’s more than 30 playable characters here, including Yoda, Jango Fett and more…
* From the App Store description:
* “The Force is strong with this one. Get ready for Angry Birds Star Wars II – the epic follow-up to the #1 smash hit game! Based on the Star Wars movie prequels, use the Force for good against the greedy Pork Federation or choose a much darker path. That’s right; for the first time ever you can “Join the Pork Side” and play as the fearsome Darth Maul, Emperor Palpatine and many other favorites!
* JOIN THE PORK SIDE! For the first time ever play as the pigs! Wield Darth Maul’s double-bladed Lightsaber, or play as Darth Vader, General Grievous and other villains!”
* Here’s your obligatory gameplay trailer:
* Angry Birds Star Wars II also includes support for TELEPODS! These are essentially physical figurines that you can ‘teleport’ into the game by placing them on your device’s camera. Rovio calls it a groundbreaking new way to play games.
* And here’s a clip showing telepods in action:
* For those interested, you can grab Angry Birds Star Wars II, for both your iPhone and iPad, from the App Store for $0.99. Initial feedback on the game seems very positive, with users, and even some reviewers, giving the title a perfect 5 stars.
* Do you plan on picking up this game today?
