* Much has been written about Apple’s new Lightning connector, introduced with the iPhone 5 to supercede the aging 30-pin Dock connection. Thursday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published three Apple patent filings from 2012 detailing how the Lightning connector is built. Among the questions addressed: how did Apple create an “orientation agnostic” connector design while also ensuring stability and proper alignment?
* Apple’s unusually detailed patent filing, oulines in excruciating detail the Lightning connector hardware design as well as its programmability and possible uses.
* The abstract outlines a dual orientation connector “having a connector tab with first and second major opposing sides and a plurality of electrical contacts carried by the connector tab.”
* The filing says the agnostic design is accomplished via an ID module that detects the correct pin and contact. Because of the connector’s small size, a method to correctly attach and remove devices from the Lightning connector is accomplished by taking a page from how older 30-pin Apple connectors work – the sheath surrounding the Lightning connector is used, coupled with “arms” used to keep the connector in place.

* Much of the patent filings are used to describe the technical gymnastics required to accomplish the Lightning’s agnostic positioning. The growing popularity of mobile devices also caused Apple to create a new connector that could accommodate the tight quarters of handsets and tablets.
* Until today, most details of the Lightning’s makeup has come from tear-downs, which revealed an authentication chip designed to prevent third-party knockoffs. The detailed patent filings indicate the sheer complexity of the Lightning design could thwart many imitators.

* Aside from its internal composition, a growing backlash has also been revealed against the Lighting connector by accessory makers, who increasingly prefer industry-standard Bluetooth wireless communication protocols.

* As we’ve discussed, creators of docks, alarm clocks and numerous other accessories designed to interface with Apple devices are upset the iPhone maker has adopted the wholly new and proprietary connection protocol.
* As a result, a trend toward wireless connections powered by the inexpensive Bluetooth industry standard may drain the Lightning’s power.
