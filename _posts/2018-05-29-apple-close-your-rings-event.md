* During next week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple’s holding a “Close Your Rings Challenge” for developers while they are in San Jose, California. It’s designed to motivate developers to close the three Apple Watch activity rings each day beginning on Sunday, June 3 through Thursday, June 7.
* To participate in this event, developers will must download a special Challenges app from the App Store and get a unique code from the developer website.
