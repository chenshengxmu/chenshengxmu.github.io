* The long-standing Apple vs. Samsung patent dispute has been dragging on for five years now without any meaningful resolution in sight, despite Samsung announcing a settlement payment of $548 million to the iPhone maker today.
* According to patent blog FOSS Patents, even though the Galaxy maker will send the payment to Apple by December 14 it’s found a loophole that would give it the right to seek reimbursement of all amounts required to be paid as taxes, and then some more.
* Samsung is now “waiting for Apple’s original invoice, and if that payment arrives before the weekend by Korean time,” writes FOSS Patents.
* After it physically receives money from Samsung, the more than half a billion dollars may not necessarily stay on Apple’s bank account forever.
* As mentioned, Samsung thinks it’s entitled to obtain reimbursement “in the event the partial judgment is reversed, modified, vacated or set aside on appeal or otherwise, including as a result of any proceedings before the USPTO addressing the patents at issue or as a result of any petition for writ of certiorari filed with the Supreme Court.”

* Apple, of course, is disputing Samsung’s right to seek reimbursement.
* The filing notes that a settlement conference that took place on November 2, 2015 “did not result in settlement,” meaning this never-ending legal battle could drag on for a few more years until all legal actions are exhausted.
* Making matter even more complicated, USPTO has invalidated one of Apple’s iPhone design patents and the pinch-to-zoom invention, but Apple is appealing that decision.
