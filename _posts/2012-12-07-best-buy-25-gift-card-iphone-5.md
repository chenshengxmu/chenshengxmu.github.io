* Best Buy, a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, has just sweetened the iPhone 5 deal by throwing in a $25 Gift Card with every purchase. You can select any iPhone 5 model with a two-year activation on Verizon Wireless, Sprint or AT&T to receive your $25 credit. And should you choose in-store pickup, your gift card will be provided in store when the phone is activated. For online orders, Best Buy will send an electronic gift card within 3–5 days of the phone ship date…
* The retailer is limiting the promotion to one gift card per iPhone 5 purchase and in-stock items only. Sales tax will be added where applicable and some orders may qualify for free shipping.
* Additional details can be found over at the Best Buy web store.
* Best Buy rival Radio Shack is running a similar promotion where they take $20 off the iPhone 5, dropping the entry-level price to an affordable $179 with a two-year contract. The discount applies to all AT&T models, including 16GB, 32GB and 64GB versions.
* As for Best Buy’s Return Policy, which applies to this and any other promotion, if you return your iPhone 5, you’ll also need to return your gift card in order to receive a full refund.
* If you are unable to do so, “the value of the free gift will be subtracted from the purchase price of the item being returned”, the retailer warns. Of course, in that case you’ll be refunded the difference.
* So no, you won’t be able to buy an iPhone 5 from Best Buy in order to redeem a gift card and then return the handset afterwards for a full refund.
* Best Buy previously had a one-day sale of the third-generation iPad, shaving $50 off and throwing in a $75 gift card. The company recently started airing a nicely done television commercial highlighting “all things Apple” at its retail outlets that happen to offer all kinds of Apple gear, from the latest LTE iPads to Macs.

* Note to Best Buy’s ad department: 480p YouTube clips don’t cut it anymore!
* The retailer, as part of its holiday push, is still offering a nice 15 percent discount on iTunes Gift Cards, amounting to a $15 saving on the priciest $100 iTunes Gift Card.
* If you’re lucky enough, you might even stumble upon one of them iTunes Gift Cards in custom denominations that have been recently spotted in the wild.
