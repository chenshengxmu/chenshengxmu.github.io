* Today has been a great day for jailbreakers. Earlier this morning we saw the release of RedSn0w 0.9.11b1 bring the ability to downgrade the firmware of A5 devices, and now a new version of Seas0nPass has become available.
* For those who aren’t familiar with the software, Seas0nPass is essentially the equivalent of RedSn0w for the Apple TV. And with version 0.8.4, you can now jailbreak your second-generation ATV on the latest firmware…
* The folks at FireCore made the announcement:
* “Seas0nPass 0.8.4 released. Adds [tethered] support for ver. 5.0.1 (iOS 5.1.1) on ATV2. ATV3 update still in progress.”
* For those wondering, we don’t expect to see a jailbreak for the ATV3 anytime soon. Yesterday, Pod2g explicitly said that his hack would not work on Apple’s latest set top box. And last month, Bile admitted that jailbreaking the new device would be an “uphill battle” without an A5 bootrom exploit.
* At any rate, second-gen ATV owners can use the new version of Seas0nPass to jailbreak the latest firmware. As always, you can pick up the software from our Downloads page, and we have a great step-by-step tutorial on how to use it.
* If you’re still trying to find a good reason to hack your Apple TV, be sure to check out our page on the benefits of jailbreaking.
