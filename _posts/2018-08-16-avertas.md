* Auxo was one of the most popular multitasking tweaks ever made, and while most people enjoyed it because of the redesigned App Switcher, the tweak was also renowned for its intuitive multitasking gestures like Hot Corners and the Quick Switcher.
* Auxo hasn’t been updated with iOS 11 support and it probably never will be. But that doesn’t mean you have to live without its award-winning multitasking gestures. A new free jailbreak tweak called Avertas by iOS developer kunderscore is now available that ports these features to jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* If the concept sounds familiar, then that’s because a jailbreak tweak called Kaze accomplished this very same task for iOS 10 devices just over a year ago.
* After installing Avertas, you can swipe up from the bottom-right corner of your display to get to the Home screen or lock your device in a pinch. The tweak bounces you to the Home screen if you use the gesture inside of an app, otherwise using the gesture from the Home screen locks your device.
* If you swipe up from the bottom-left corner of your display instead, you’re presented with the Quick Switcher. Once the interface appears, you can drag left and right without lifting your finger to move between recently-used apps, like so:

* As you might come to expect, Avertas adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can fine-tune the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* Right out of the box, Avertas feels like a carbon copy of the multitasking gesture functionality that came bundled with Auxo back in the day, and that’s because it practically is – right down to the icon.
* If you happen to miss this fantastic functionality and want it back on your jailbroken iOS 11 device, then you can download Avertas for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* Let us know how Avertas worked for you in the comments section below.
