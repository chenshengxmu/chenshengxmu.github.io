* Well that didn’t take long. Just a week after Google’s revamped Search app with new voice technology made it into the App Store, a jailbreak tweak has been released that will allow users to supplant it for Siri in iOS.
* The voice recognition tech in the new Google Search app has received a lot of praise for its speedy response times and accurate results. And now, thanks to the new tweak NowNow, you can access it from anywhere…
* NowNow is a simple utility for jailbroken iOS devices that allows you to launch the Google Search app with an Activator function. There’s no Home screen icon, just a single option in Settings to select an Activator.
* As you can see, it works pretty well. So whether you’re a fan of the Google Search app, or you’re on an older device that doesn’t have Siri and you’re looking to fill the void, this tweak is certainly worth checking out.
* If you’re interested, you can find NowNow in Cydia, on the BigBoss repo, for free. You’ll obviously need a jailbroken device and the new Google Search App, which is also available for free, in the App Store.
* Have you tried it yet? What do you think?
