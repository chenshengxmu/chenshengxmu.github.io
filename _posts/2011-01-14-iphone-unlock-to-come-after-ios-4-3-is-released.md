title: iPhone Unlock to Come After iOS 4.3 is Released

* There’s one song that is coming to my mind right now: Waiting in Vain, by Bob Marley. Maybe I’ve got this song stuck in my head because I’m going to Jamaica next week, or maybe because it really seems to be the story behind the iPhone 4 unlock.
* A month ago we were told that we’d get an unlock for the iPhone 4 by January 16th, which was the Dev Team’s priority. Now a tweet from MuscleNerd giving an “official statement” about the unlock, confirming that it will not be released before iOS 4.3 comes out, most likely next month…
* I don’t know about you but it does feel like Apple is winning the cat and mouse game lately. No stable untethered jailbreak, no stable unlock. Damn, I even gave up my iPad jailbreak yesterday and restored to a clean firmware.
* Now don’t get me wrong, I know these guys are doing their best. I have great respect for what they do, but maybe instead of fighting each other on Twitter, they should just remain quiet until they do have something to offer.
* While you’re waiting for the unlock, why don’t you tell us what you think about this situation?
