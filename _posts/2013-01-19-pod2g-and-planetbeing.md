* So hereâ€™s something we havenâ€™t heard in a while: good news on the jailbreak front. It looks like now that pod2g has completed his first iOS app, entitled podDJ, the security expert has turned his attention to hacking iOS 6.
* His return alone is great news, since it seems like heâ€™s been gone from the community forever. But to add to the excitement, the hacker just announced that he and planetbeing recently discovered two new vulnerabilitiesâ€¦
* Hereâ€™s planetbeingâ€™s tweet regarding the hacking session:
* Made some nice progress today with @pod2g. I think Iâ€™ll try to reward myself with a nap. ðŸ™‚

* And hereâ€™s pod2gâ€™s response:
* . @planetbeing oh yeah! 2 new vulnerabilities in a day, chance was with us. But we still miss that initial code execution for a public jb :/
* â€” pod2g (@pod2g) January 19, 2013
* This is great news, obviously, as iOS 6 has thus farÂ proven to be a tough nut to crack for hackers. In fact, back in DecemberÂ Mark Dowd said that AppleÂ has practically overhauled security in the latest version of its mobile firmware.
* Donâ€™t get too excite yet though, as pod2g notes that they still have a ways to go. Even after theyâ€™ve completed the jailbreak, theyâ€™ll still have to test it across all devices, and build and test the desktop software, to ensure that itâ€™s stable.
* But still, progress is progress. Well done guys.
