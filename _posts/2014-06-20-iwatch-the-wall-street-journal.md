* Hot on the heels of a report from Reuters yesterday regarding the iWatch, The Wall Street Journal has published a scoop of its own on Apple’s oft-rumored smartwatch. The outlet agrees with some previous speculation, and offers up some new details on the device.
* Citing sources familiar with the project, the site says Apple is planning multiple versions of its smartwatch. It’s working on different designs, and sizes, in an effort to appeal to various tastes in fashion. It also adds that the watch will feature more than 10 built-in sensors…
* Here’s more from The Journal’s Eva Dou:
* Apple Inc. AAPL -0.08% is planning multiple versions of its smartwatch, likely to be launched in the fall, people familiar with the matter said.
* The new wrist device from Apple will include more than 10 sensors including ones to track health and fitness, these people said. Apple aims to address an overarching criticism of existing smartwatches that they fail to provide functions significantly different from that of a smartphone, said a person familiar with the matter.
* Dou goes on to add that the smartwatch will likely come in multiple screen sizes, and that a source at a component supplier estimates shipments of the watch will total between 10 and 15 million units this year. Exact specifications of the device are still being finalized.
* Additionally, Dou’s sources corroborate information from Reuters yesterday, saying that Quanta Computer will be handling the initial bulk of iWatch production. That’s expected to begin next month, ahead of what seems to be a widely-agreed upon October launch date.
* Reuters also reported that the iWatch will feature a form of wireless charging, a 2.5-inch display, and at least one of its sensors will be used for pulse. Little else is known about the wearable, but with production starting next month, we could start seeing part leaks soon.
