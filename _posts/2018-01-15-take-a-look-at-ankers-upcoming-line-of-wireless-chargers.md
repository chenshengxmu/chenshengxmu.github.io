* Anker has announced a significant revamp to their wireless chargers at CES 2018. We went hands on with several of their new chargers, squarely aimed at the latest iPhones.
* Anker is releasing the PowerWave Duo to charge two devices at once, a car charger, a charging pad, and a charging stand.
* They had similar items in their lineup previously, but the new ones are made to support the 7.5W of charging speed on the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.
* Check out our hands on video to see the lineup before it launches.

* The chargers should all start rolling out soon, and many will feature the white finish, different than the dark finish on their other wireless chargers.
* What do you think of Anker’s new chargers? Going to be picking one up?
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
