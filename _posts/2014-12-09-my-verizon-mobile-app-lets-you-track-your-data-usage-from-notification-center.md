* Verizon customers who use the official My Verizon Mobile app can now track their data usage directly from the Today tab of Notification Center. The app was updated yesterday with this new feature that should allow users to keep their data usage in check. The widget is updated automatically based on users’ plan and usage, showing the total data allocation as well as currently used data.
* This widget is definitely a useful addition to the carrier’s official app, and as an AT&T user myself, I am hoping other carriers will follow big red’s lead. For those non-Verizon users who would like to somewhat replicate this feature, the DataMan Pro app available in the App Store offers something similar, although not as reliable as the data tracking report coming straight from the carrier.
* My Verizon Mobile is a free download in the App Store.
