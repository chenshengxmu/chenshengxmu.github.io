* Final Fantasy VII is coming to iOS this year, reports gaming publication IGN. The outlet was in attendance at Square Enix’s E3 press conference earlier today when company executive Shinji Hashimoto announced a mobile port for the title is in the works.
* The game will apparently be a port of the original PlayStation title, which debuted in 1997, and not the much-hyped remake that Sony announced at E3 this week. That release is slated to land exclusively, at least at first, on the PS4 at a date not yet known.
* Square Enix has been very aggressive with its mobile strategy, releasing a number of ports of popular PC and console games, including at least 6 from its Final Fantasy franchise. The FF titles have done particularly well in the App Store, averaging 4.5 stars.
* There’s no word yet on when Final Fantasy VII will land on iOS, or what it’ll be priced at, but current FF games sell for as much as $16.
