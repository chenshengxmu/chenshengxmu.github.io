* Vimeo users will be happy to hear that the video site has rolled out a new build of its iOS client. The update brings the app to version 4.2, and it brings about new video upload and private sharing options, as well as new find and follow features.
* With Vimeo 4.2 on iPhone and iPad, you can now upload videos from your device’s Camera Roll, straight to Vimeo from within the app. You can also now share videos with people you follow on Vimeo privately, so they won’t show up in your feed…
* Here are your 4.2 release notes:
* Upload videos to Vimeo right from your Camera Roll and share them with friends. Then feast your eyeballs on gorgeous HD playback with no ads before, after, or on top of your videos. In your feed you’ll find a handful of amazing Staff Picks curated by our team every day, plus videos by your friends, family, and other cool people around the world.
* What’s New in Version 4.2
* Easily upload videos in your Camera Roll to Vimeo, right within the app.
* Privately share videos with people you follow on Vimeo.
* Find and follow friends already on Vimeo, and invite others to join.
* Although it remains an underdog in a world dominated by YouTube and Vine, Vimeo has been on the move. Last year, it became an official iOS partner, and it has since made two big app acquisitions. In May, its mobile app received a major redesign.
* Anyway, if want to check out today’s update, you can find the latest version of the Vimeo app in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free. Unfortunately, you’ll need an account (also free) in order to get past the application’s splash screen.
