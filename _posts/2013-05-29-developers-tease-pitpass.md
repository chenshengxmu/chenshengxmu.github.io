* Fans will be happy to hear today that Second Gear, the developers of the popular iOS note-taking and Markdown editing app Elements, have a new application in the works. We don’t yet know what that app is, but we do know how they’ll announce it.
* Passbook, apparently. The team has created an information server called Pit Pass, and it will actually push updates regarding the status of their new app to devices using Passbook. It’s a clever idea, that has heightened anticipation for their new software…
* Folks interested in checking out Pit Pass can simply visit the Pit Pass website on an iOS device. Once there, you’ll be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, and desired username—they’ll reserve it for you, and then you’ll tap the ‘Get Pit Pass’ button.
* There’s not much on the actual pass itself now. There’s a link to Second Gear’s Elements app, the team’s social media stuff, and the following message: “We’re just getting started unwrapping our new app. With this Pit Pass, you’ll be the first to know the details.”
* The developers say that they are hoping to release Pit Pass in the future, as a standalone service, so that other Web and app developers can use Passbook for their own app releases. Those interested in the service can get more information on it here.
* I have to say, I love the whole idea. What an innovative use of Passbook. What do you think about it?
