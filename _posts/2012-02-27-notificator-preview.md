* Wouldn’t it be neat to receive a banner notification once that huge app finishes downloading? What about a less intrusive banner notification when your device is running low on battery life?
* Notificator is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that can do that and more. In total there are eight system events that can be customized with both banners and sound to keep you abreast of what’s happening on your device.
* Take a look at our full video preview inside…
* Notificator is still in development at the moment, but its creator tells me that it should be released on Cydia’s BigBoss repo by the end of the week for $0.99.
* What do you think about Notificator? Does it look useful to you?
