* It’s that time of the year again and Apple’s September 7th keynote will be kicking off tomorrow in what is expected to bring the unveiling of the next-generation iPhone and some other exciting surprises.
* If you’re ready to tune in and see what Apple has to offer, we’ll be showing you in this piece how you can live-stream the event on various devices.
* There are some requirements you will have to meet to live-stream the Apple event on your computer or mobile device, just like every year. The requirements apply to Mac users, mobile device users, Apple TV users, and also to Windows users:
* If you’re going to be using your Mac or iOS device, and you’ve met the requirements above, then you will just need to visit Apple’s September 7th Event web page in your web browser and you’re good to go.
* As usual, the stream starts at 10:00 A.M. PDT. You can simply click on the link at that time, or if you see nothing by the time the stream rolls around, refresh the page and the live video stream should start loading.
* For those of you with an Apple TV, the process differs depending on what generation of the device you have.
* If your Apple TV is a third-generation or earlier, you will see the event icon appear on your Home screen automatically and you can select it with your remote to play it starting at 10:00 A.M. PDT.
* For those with the newer fourth-generation Apple TV, you will need to download the free Apple Events app from the App Store and stream the event from that app instead.
* It’s okay to launch the app a bit early, as the streaming should begin as soon as a live video feed is available.
* For Windows users, there are different processes depending on the version of Windows you’re running.
* If you’re on Windows 10, then all you have to do is open the Edge web browser and visit Apple’s September 7th Event web page and wait for the live video stream to begin at 10:00 A.M. PDT.
* If you’re on Windows 8.1 or earlier, then you can’t use your web browser. You may want to try using the free VLC app to live-stream the event on your computer instead.
* 1) Launch the app from your Home screen and tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream.
* 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL:
* http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436/1609lijbsdfvoihbadfvohbsdfvljhb/master/4500/4500.m3u8?t=YWxpc2FtaXg=
* 3) Tap on the Play button after 10:00 A.M. PDT (1:00 P.M. EST) and the live stream will be playing from VLC Media Player.
* Streaming from an Android device
* Android users will have to get accustomed to using the VLC app too, as it’s necessary to live-stream an Apple event. If you don’t already have it, grab it for free now, and then follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the app from your Home screen and tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream.
* 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL:
