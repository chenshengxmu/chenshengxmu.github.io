* Developer Flexibits today rolled out an update to Fantastical for Mac, its reminder and calendar replacement available on both iOS and OS X.
* Fantastical 2.1, the first major update to the Mac edition, features full support for Macs running OS X El Capitan ahead of its release next week, including support for El Capitan’s split-screen multitasking.
* A host of other changes and improvements have found their way into this release of Fantastical, such as swiping to delete events on El Capitan systems.
* People on Yosemite and earlier versions can now scroll to a specific day or week in the Week and Month views with a trackpad and organize Reminders by list, but that’s just tip of the iceberg. . You should also appreciate the ability to navigate in Day, Week and Month views with the arrow keys and shortcuts for cutting, copying, and pasting events and Reminders.
* Flexibits said users on El Capitan betas who had issues with previous builds of Fantastical should now be in the clear.
* The following changes are mentioned in Fantastical 2.1 release notes:
* I briefly checked out the new version of Fantastical and it’s indeed full of improvements. If I were you, I’d check out new font and Menu bar icon options within the app’s Preferences section.
