* Next Monday is Labor Day, a national holiday in the United States, and the nation’s top electronics retailer Best Buy is hoping to counter Apple’s upcoming iPhone trade-in program by offering the iPhone 5 half price. That’s right, you can get a brand new 16 or 32GB iPhone 5 for at least half of its normal asking price, by trading-in your iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S in good condition (no water damage or screen cracks).
* Of course, you’re expected to commit your soul to AT&T, Verizon or Sprint for two more years. This is obviously becoming a thing for Best Buy: just two weeks ago, they were offering a $200 credit in exchange for your iPhone 4S in working condition…
* Best Buy’s offer is valid from Friday, August 30 through Monday, September 2.
* CNET reports that Best Buy is guaranteeing a $100 credit on the 16GB iPhone 5 and a minimum of $150 off the 32G model.
* The promotion is applicable for the 16/32GB iPhone 5 models only and customers must be eligible for an upgrade with their carrier.
* Unlocked, no-contract devices or T-Mobile iPhones are not eligible.
* The exact trade-in value of your iPhone 4/4S will be determined in-store and is dependent on a number of factors, including the overall appearance and the condition of the handset.
* If Best Buy determines your device is in pristine condition and worth more than the guaranteed credit, an additional amount will be provided in the form of a Best Buy gift card.
* Apple is rumored to kickstart its iPhone trade-in program on August 30, with broad in-store availability likely to coincide with the arrival of new iPhones on store shelves.
* Apple hasn’t made it official yet, but here’s what Tim Cook said about it back in July:
* The reason that a trade-in program is so attractive around an iPhone is that the residual value of an iPhone stays so high. That makes the trade-in programs a win-win from many points of view. But we haven’t announced anything.
* Other retailers have been slashing Apple’s handset ahead of Apple’s big reveal on September 11, but I’d think twice before taking the plunge.
* Realistically, iPhone 4/4S owners who are eligible for an upgrade are better off waiting the iPhone 5S/5C announcement out and opt for the latest hardware, don’t you think?
