* Yahoo’s main search-focused iPhone and iPad application has received a refresh today. In addition to an improved navigation system focused on the new side panel accessible by swiping, Yahoo 5.4 for iOS now integrates latest local news headlines and finally lets you comment on stories within the app.
* “Today we’re bringing local news to your fingertips with the Yahoo App,” writes the Internet company. “As you move around the country, you’ll be able to see what’s going on in your area.”
* If the headlines presented in the app feel a little underwhelming, just swipe to the right for more news and customization options allowing you to cherry-pick news categories that are relevant to you. Keep in mind that you must be logged in to get personalized stories, based on the topics that interest you.

* And no longer do you have to jump to Yahoo’s website in order to comment on stories as the app now integrates comments along with the voting system. Check out the newly implemented commenting system in action.

* Lastly, the new side-swipe navigation makes it easier to move from personalized news to local news to Yahoo’s popular sections such as Tech or Yahoo Style or to any of the available categories for that matter, like World, Business, Sports, Science and more.
* To fine-tune your experience, just drag the categories you care about most to the top of the list to see that content on the first page when you open the app. If you’d rather not see something on the first page, just uncheck its category.
* The Yahoo Today button in the upper right hand corner still gives you access to your local weather, favorite sports teams, popular Flickr photos and videos, stocks and more.
* Yahoo 5.4 changelog:
* The 46.5-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Yahoo for iOS free in the App Store.
