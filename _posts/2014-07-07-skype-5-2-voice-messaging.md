* Having unceremoniously removed voice messaging from the recently remastered Skype 5.0 for iPhone, the Microsoft-owned VoIP provider on Monday pushed a minor update that has brought the useful feature back while adding two others.
* The new Skype 5.2 for iPhone is rolling out this morning. In addition to voice messaging, the refreshed Skype app has also brought back the ability to access contact profiles while allowing you to add participants to the existing conversation at any time…
* Key highlight of Skype 5.2 include:
* “We are continuing to work on bringing you new features to further enhance your Skype on iPhone experience,” wrote Skype in a blog post.
* Download Skype 5.2 for iPhone free in the App Store.
* The iPhone and iPod touch app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Skype for iPad sits at version 4.17.3 as it hasn’t been revamped with a sleek new look yet.
