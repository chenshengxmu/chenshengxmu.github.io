* In this article, we’re offering a running list of Apple’s original TV shows and series that are likely to arrive in the coming years. As more details emerge, we’ll update this post. 
* Updated Sept. 5: Morgan Stanley has high hopes for Apple’s video streaming business.
* It doesn’t yet have a video streaming service like Hulu or Netflix. Nonetheless, Apple plans to introduce a significant number of original TV programs in the coming years. While it’s not yet known how the iPhone maker plans on distributing these titles (most likely through a new subscription service), details about the shows have finally started to leak in recent months.
* In June 2017, Apple hired Jamie Erlicht and Zach Van Amburg, formerly of Sony Pictures Television, as the co-leaders of the company’s new worldwide video unit. In November 2017, the company tipped its hand that it was branching out into original scripted programming when it announced it had signed Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon for a new drama.
* In the following months, news surfaced that Apple could spend around $4.2 billion on original programming by 2022. The content is expected to begin airing between March and the summer of 2019.
* Apple has only released two original TV shows and series to date, “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” and “Planet of the Apps.” While the former has found some success, the latter was canceled after just one season.
* First introduced on Aug. 9, 2017, the series grew out of a popular recurring segment by the same name on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.” Also starring Corden, “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” pairs various celebrities with each other as they belt out fan-friendly songs.
* Status: Renewed for season 2; the first season included 21 episodes, all available through the TV app and Apple TV.
* First launched in June 2017, “Planet of the Apps” featured Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.iam, and Gary Vaynerchuk, as judges who listened to pitches from would-be app developers. Featuring 10 episodes, the series was officially canceled in June. Around the same time, Vaynerchuk had some unkind words to say about Apple, noting the company “did everything wrong” in promoting the series.
* Status: “Planet of the Apps” became the first Apple series canceled. Season 1 episodes are available to stream through the TV app.
* Here’s a list of Apple’s TV shows and series currently in production, as of Aug. 22, 2018:

* On Aug. 22, TVLine learned that Moon Bloodgood (“Falling Skies,” “Code Black”) was exiting the series.
