* Every week, iDownloadBlog shows you a selection of app picks that we think are interesting. While we tend to choose apps from the App Store, we occasionally throw in a web or jailbreak app as well. This week, we’ve got three awesome App Store apps for you to check out. We hope you enjoy this week’s picks!

* We occasionally like to show cool infographics on iDB, but we have yet to come across an app that lets you create beautiful infographics on the iPhone… until now. Photo Stats lets create visually intriguing infographics that give detailed information about your photography habits on the iPhone.

* Photo Stats tells you when, where, and how you take pictures, and it breaks down that information into helpful facts. For instance, Photo Stats will tell you when you’re the most productive at taking good photos on your iPhone, whether you like to take more pics at night or during the day, what kind of settings you like to use for your camera, and where you’ve taken the most interesting photos in your collection.
* For visualizing your iPhoneography, it doesn’t get better than Photo Stats. You can also share your infographics with your friends through email or on Twitter and Facebook. Photo Stats is available for $0.99 in the App Store.

* PhoneDrive turns your iPhone and iPad into a WiFi/USB drive. With PhoneDrive, you can play, browse, organize, share, download, and manage your files on any iDevice. This app is feature-packed, and it offers a long list of enhancements for those that deal with transferring all kinds of files.
* One of the main draws of PhoneDrive is its media player. You can play all sorts of files right in the app. PhoneDrive’s download manager acts as your portable drive for files that you download from your iDevice. Jailbreakers that have used iFile will be very familiar with the way that PhoneDrive works.

* PhoneDrive lets you connect to a personal hotspot to wirelessly transfer files from device to device across a WiFi network. Yes, that means that you can send files between two iPhones without a jailbreak Bluetooth app like Celeste. The app has a built-in text editor, impressive audio player, and a long list of compatible file types.
* Think of PhoneDrive as your all-in-one file manager for the iPhone/iPad. It’s available as a universal download for only $0.99 in the App Store.

* Jeff already showed you guys Match Panic in action during his last episode of What’s On My iDevice. If you haven’t already checked it out, make sure to download Match Panic and see what you think. It’s one seriously addicting game, if we do say so ourselves.

* Essentially, Match Panic is a very simple game that involves you matching animals with their corresponding icon on the screen. The gameplay is kind of like Tap Tap Revenge, only more basic. You’re racing against the clock in Match Panic, and you have to complete the level by matching and tapping the little animals as fast as you can.
* Match Panic will definitely test your mental agility, and you’ll find yourself playing it for longer periods of time that you originally planned. Match Panic is available on the iPhone and iPad for $0.99 in the App Store.
* That’s it for this week’s picks! Let us know what you think of these apps in the comments below!
