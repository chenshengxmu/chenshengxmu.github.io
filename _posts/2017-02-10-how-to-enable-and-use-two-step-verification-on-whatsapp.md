* Like many online services out there, WhatsApp provides two-step verification as an additional layer of security for your account.
* An optional measure designed to help strengthen the security of your account, two-step verification requires that you verify your mobile phone number after installing WhatsApp’s mobile app on a new device with a six-digit code that you created using this feature.
* Here’s how to enable two-step verification for your WhatsApp account.
* This feature requires you to create a six-digit passcode and provide an optional rescue email address. Upon enabling two-step verification, you’ll need to enter the passcode every time you install WhatsApp on a new device.
* Unlike similar two-step verification systems, WhatsApp doesn’t generate these passcodes for you—each and every user is required to create their custom passcode for two-step verification.
* As a fallback mechanism, you can provide a rescue email address where WhatsApp will send you a link to disable two-step verification if you forget the passcode.
* Think twice before skipping this step: if you enable two-step verification without providing an email address, and you forget your passcode, WhatsApp will lock you out of your account.
* If you forget the passcode but did not provide a rescue email address, you won’t be allowed to reverify your mobile phone number within seven days of last using WhatsApp.
* After seven days, your number will be permitted to reverify on WhatsApp without the passcode, but all pending messages upon reverifying will be deleted.
* Lastly, and most importantly, if your mobile phone number is reverified on WhatsApp after 30 days of last using the service, and without the passcode, your account will be deleted and a new one will be created upon successfully reverifying.
* 1) Launch WhatsApp on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap the Settings tab at the bottom of the screen.
* 3) Tap Account → Two-Step Verification.
* 4) Tap Enable.

* Tip: WhatsApp will periodically ask you to confirm the passcode. There’s currently no option to disable this without turning the two-step verification feature off.
* 6) Now enter your optional rescue email address, then confirm it.

* Tip: The system doesn’t verify your email for accuracy so be sure to type it properly.
* You’re wholeheartedly recommended to provide a rescue email address so that you can disable the two-step verification feature if you ever forget your passcode.
* IMPORTANT: Should you receive an email from WhatsApp containing a link to disable two-step verification, but did not request this, do not click on it because someone could be attempting to verify your phone number on WhatsApp.
* 7) Tap Done to finish setting up two-step verification.
* Congratulations, your WhatsApp account is now protected with two-step verification!

* That’s it, you just changed your two-step verification passcode!
* Be sure to keep the passcode in safe place because you will lose access to your WhatsApp account if you forget it but didn’t provide a rescue email address through which you could disable two-step verification.
* 1) Launch WhatsApp on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Settings → Account → Two-Step Verification → Change Email Address.
* 3) Enter a new rescue email address for two-step verification, then confirm it.

* That’s it, you just changed your rescue email address.
* If you forget your passcode, simply ask WhatsApp to email you a link to disable two-step verification. Be sure to double-check that you have typed your email address properly because WhatsApp doesn’t verify it for accuracy.
