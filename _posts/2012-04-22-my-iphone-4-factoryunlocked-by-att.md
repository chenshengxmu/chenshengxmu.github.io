* So it took a while, but I can confirm that my iPhone 4 has been officially unlocked by the fine folks at AT&T. It looks like my online chat with the AT&T representative paid off after all.
* All I had to do was pop in my T-Mobile SIM and load up iTunes. I was then presented with a beautiful message that stated: Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked.
* Oddly enough, this unlock has nothing to do with the SAM unlock method that was revealed earlier this morning. This is a follow up to AT&T’s promise to unlock out of contract iPhones…
* This unlock is more in line with a factory unlock, and it is permanent. No jailbreak is required to accomplish this type of unlock.
* To be eligible, you must have an out of contract phone that was used on AT&T.
* I think I’ll relegate my iPhone 4 as my go to travel phone going forward, since I’m now able to freely use it with any GSM SIM card.
* Has AT&T unlocked your iPhone yet? Let us know what your experience has been thus far with AT&T, and how you plan on using it going forward.
