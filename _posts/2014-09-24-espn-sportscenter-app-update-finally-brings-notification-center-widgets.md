* Sports fan rejoice, as ESPN has finally updated its SportsCenter app to make good use of Notification Center widgets in the Today tab. The SportsCenter app has been the one Apple used in its marketing materials related to widgets in Notification Center, so it is strange that it took ESPN a week since the release of iOS 8 to actually have this update ready for the public. But who are we to complain, right?
* Simply add teams as favorite inside the app to have their upcoming (or currently playing) game displayed in Notification Center. You can then tap on the widget to get more details about the game in question.
* As a side note for early birds, if you donâ€™t see the update available yet, simply delete and install the app again (it worked for me).
