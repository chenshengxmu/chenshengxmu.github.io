* Facebook on Wednesday confirmed that Oculus, a virtual-reality company it bought in March of 2014 for $2 billion, will be launching its hotly anticipated Rift virtual-reality headset at the end of March 2016.
* Priced at $599, the device is now available for pre-order and will initially ship to 20 countries starting March 28, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, Oculus said.
* The Rift comes bundled with two games—Lucky’s Tale and EVE: Valkyrie—with more than a hundred games coming later this year, including Rockband VR by Harmonix, Edge of Nowhere by Insomniac, The Climb by Crytek and Minecraft by Microsoft-owned Mojang.
* In addition to the bundled games and the headset itself, which features a built-in mic and headphones, the box also includes a sensor, a Rift remote, cables and Xbox One controller.
* “After years of development, our virtual reality experience, Oculus Rift, is now available for pre-order,” Facebook CEO and Co-Founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post. It will also be available in limited locations at select retailers starting in April.

* “When you put on Oculus, you’ll feel like you instantly teleported into adventures like deep-sea diving, piloting a straighter or playing in a band on stage,” teased Zuckerberg.
* The full list of Rift launch countries is available at the Oculus website.
* As mentioned, the Rift includes a special remote, an input device Oculus designed to make it simple and intuitive to navigate virtual reality content. You’ll use it to browse the Oculus store, explore 360-degree videos and experience a wide range of virtuality-games and entertainment.

* “It is the easiest way to introduce non-gamers to virtual reality,” said Oculus. When you pre-order Rift, you’ll also secure your place in line for Touch motion controller pre-orders which open later in the year, with first Touch shipments scheduled to commence in the second half of the year.
* Here’s what the Touch looks like.
* Pricing on the motion-input controllers will be announced in due time. More information on the Touch controllers is available over at Oculus’s website.
