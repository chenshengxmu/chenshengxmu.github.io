* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Tsuro. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the beautiful tabletop port for free on both iPhone and iPad—a nice little savings of $3.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* This gorgeous digital board game couldn’t be any simpler to learn, but true mastery lies at the end of a long and winding path. As fans of Tsuro’s tabletop incarnation, we love how faithfully—and beautifully—the experience is re-created here. App-exclusive ways to play add new layers of depth, letting us get lost for hours among these tricky, twisty trails.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Tsuro is available in the App Store for free.
