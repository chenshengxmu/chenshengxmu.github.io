* Folks with Gmail, Dropbox and/or Google Drive accounts will be happy to hear that there is a new app available that allows you to search through them with a single tap. It’s called FindIt, and it can locate emails and files for you on all three services.
* Need to pull up an old email? No problem. Just type in the name of the person who sent it to you, or part of its subject line, and FindIt will track it down. And the same goes with media and other file types. Think Spotlight search for your cloud apps…
* Here are some of the app’s more notable features:
* • Find files from Gmail, Google Drive, & Dropbox with a single search • No more waiting while your phone searches through archived emails on the server • Feel confident you can find what you need when you need it • 30 free email or file previews each month to make sure you found what you were looking for
* As you can see in the screenshots, the app itself looks gorgeous. In line with recent design trends, FindIt’s UI is simple and straightforward. Text, buttons and other elements are flat, the graphics are sharp, and transitions between screens happen quickly.

* While the overall premise of FindIt is great, there are a few caveats. For instance, it looks like you can only add one account per service—so only one Gmail—and files can take a while to load. And, once files do load, you’re limited to what you can do with them.
* That being said, this is just the first version. Hopefully we’ll see these issues fixed in a future update, along with—dare I say—support for other cloud and email services. Until then, though, it’s still worth checking out. You can find it in the App Store, for free.
