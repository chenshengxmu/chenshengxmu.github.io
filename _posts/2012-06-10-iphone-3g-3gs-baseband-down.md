* Last year, the Dev Team announced that iPhone 3G/3GS owners unlocked on baseband 06.15.00 would likely be stuck there forever, leaving them to deal with GPS bugs and other issues.
* But that may not be the case, as it appears that hackers have been working on a fix. Unlocking expert MuscleNerd has just announced that a baseband downgrade is on the horizon…
* MuscleNerd tweeted:
* “Made great progress yesterday on downgrade from BB 06.15 (for 3G/3GS owners who got officially unlocked). All the pieces are there :)”
* This is good news, as most folks weren’t aware that a solution was being worked on. And although there’s no ETA for a release yet, the words “all the pieces are there” certainly sound promising.
* We’ll be sure to keep you updated on this as more information becomes available, so stay tuned.
* Any 3G/3GS owners out there excited for a baseband downgrade?
