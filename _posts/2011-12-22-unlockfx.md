* UnlockFX is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that consists of over two dozen unlock animations to customize your iPhone.
* The tweak includes both simple and complex animations that can be altered on the fly without the need to respring your device.
* Check inside for a video sneak preview of UnlockFX in action…
* This is the perfect tweak if you’re looking to customize the look of your unlock animation, and it also includes provisions to alter the speed of the animations and create a custom photo animation as well.
* UnlockFX should be available sometime after the untethered jailbreak touches down, which should be soon by all accounts.
* It’s designed by renowned developer Filippo Bigarella, the creator of tweaks like Springtomize 2 and SlideAway, and it’ll be available on Cydia for $1.99.
* What do you think?
