title: MailKeyboardHide De-clutters Your Composing Screen

* Just last month we told you about SMSHideKeyboard, a jailbreak tweak that brought iOS 5-like SMS keyboard hiding to the jailbreak scene.
* Today we have a similar tweak, but one that has a trick up its sleeve. Going by the name of MailKeyboardHide, this slight variation of SMSHideKeyboard offers the ability to hide the iPhone’s keyboard during the composition of emails.
* And it also does more than that…
* Despite the rather vague name, MailKeyboardHide actually allows the iOS software keyboard to be removed from the screen in any app. All you need is the flick of a finger.
* Here’s the scenario: you’re typing out a long email, but you want to have a quick proof read, just to iron out any kinks. Currently, you’re stuck with the large on-screen keyboard filling the display, leaving barely enough room for you to see your content. You want rid of that keyboard, and unless you install MailKeyboardHide, you can’t.
* Once you’ve done the wise thing and downloaded the tweak from Cydia (it’s free, by the way), all that is needed is a flick up or down with your finger, and the keyboard goes away. Tapping the input area will have the keyboard sliding back up. Simple.
* Let’s hope Apple includes this in iOS 5, seeing as they already brought a similar functionality to the Messages app.
