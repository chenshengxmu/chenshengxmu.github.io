* Not all automobiles that come outfitted with an integrated wireless charging mat will work with your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X.
* Thankfully, Apple’s identified car brands and models with a Qi-certified wireless charger.
* Here’s a list of the vehicles that are 100 percent guaranteed compatible with the Qi wireless charging standard that the latest Apple smartphones take advantage of.
* The following vendors offer vehicles with a Qi-compatible wireless charging pad that will work flawlessly with your iPhone 8 or iPhone X though there are some outliers (see further below).
* As Apple notes, some in-car wireless chargers are too small to fit Plus-sized devices.
* If your iPhone 8 Plus is too big to fit in your car’s wireless charging mat, you’ll have to plug the phone into a cable to charge.
* “If you’re planning on buying a car with a wireless charger, make sure that your iPhone will fit in the charger first,” reads an advisory on Apple’s website.
* You can also use Qi wireless charging in these Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles:
* Wireless charging implementation in 2017 and earlier models from Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC does not meet the requirements for Qi certification so those models won’t wirelessly charge your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X.
* Bottom line: Although many cars have had integrated wireless charging capability for quite some time now, car manufacturers only until recently started using the ubiquitous Qi standard.
* As a result, only certain vehicles which specifically meet the requirements for Qi certification will work with your beloved Apple smartphone.
