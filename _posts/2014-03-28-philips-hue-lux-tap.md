* Philips’ iPhone-connected Hue lighting system has come a long way since we first reviewed it in 2012. The company has added a number of products to the lineup over the years, including LightStrips, Bloom bulbs, and bulbs for recessed lighting installs. And today, it’s expanding the line even more.
* This morning, Philips announced three new upcoming Hue products. The first is known as the ‘hue lux,’ a bulb that can only emit white light, the second is the ‘hue tap,’ which allows you to control the Hue system without the iPhone app, and the third is luminaires, a set of high-end 3D light fixtures…
* The hue lux is an LED light bulb, similar to the existing hue bulb, except that it can only emit white light—no colors. Users can, however, still remotely control the brightness of the lux and set on/off schedules. The lux will be available this summer in a starter kit for $100, or individual bulbs for $40.
* The hue tap isn’t a bulb at all, but more of an accessory to the hue lighting system. It’s actually a mountable switch that makes it easy to control your hue lights without the iPhone app. The tap includes four programmable buttons, and does not require wiring or batteries. It’ll be available soon for $60.

* And finally, there’s the luminaires. Philips’ new table and pendant luminaires were designed by WertelOberfell and Strand+Hvass. Each is 3D-printed, remotely controlled, and capable of displaying any of 16 million colors. At just over $4000 USD, they’re pricey, but they’ll be available March 31st.
* Of course, the rest of the Hue products aren’t exactly inexpensive. The standard starter kit, which includes 3 multicolored LED bulbs and the required network bridge, goes for $199. You can save a little by getting white-only lux bulbs, but it’s still far more costly than your average Walmart 6-pack.
