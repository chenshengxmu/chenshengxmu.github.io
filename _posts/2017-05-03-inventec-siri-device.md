* Following claims that Apple has finalized designs for its alleged standalone Siri/AirPlay device, Chinese-language Economic Daily News report Wednesday that AirPods manufacture Inventec has now landed orders for the device.
* According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the connected speaker will be Apple’s first AI-based smart home device, powered by Siri and supporting AirPlay and other features.
* It’s expected to take on Amazon’s smart home assistant Echo, but will be aimed at the premium segment of the market.
* Inventec is the sole assembler of Apple’s wireless AirPod products, while iPhone manufacturer Foxconn Electronics is the sole producer of Amazon’s Echo devices. Kuo said Apple may announced the device at WWDC 2017 in June. He added adding that the connected AI-driven speaker will be priced higher than Amazon’s $179 Echo.
