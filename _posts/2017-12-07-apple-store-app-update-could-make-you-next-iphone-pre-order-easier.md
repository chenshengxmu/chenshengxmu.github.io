* Version 4.4 of the Apple Store app has been released with enhancements for iOS 11, the ability to scan in your credit card info, and the option to bypass the pre-authorization requirement for purchasing iPhones.
* The scanning feature is very useful when trying to check out. Instead of manually entering the info, you are able to simply scan the credit card to automatically add its info at check out.
* You are now also able to put off authorizing and activating your iPhone, a feature that has been available on Apple’s website since November for the iPhone X. This feature should make pre-ordering a new iPhone faster going forward since it bypasses the check with the carrier.
* What’s New in Version 4.4 – iOS 11 enhancements – Scanner now available to easily add your credit card information at checkout – Customers now have the option to bypass pre-authorization and activate later on full price purchases of iPhones on AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint
* The Apple Store app has gained many features over the years, and Apple has touted it as the best way to buy the latest iPhones.
* You can download it on the App Store for free.
