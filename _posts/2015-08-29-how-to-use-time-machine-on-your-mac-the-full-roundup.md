* Over the last several months, we’ve revisited Time Machine, the backup utility present in OS X. We’ve showed you everything from performing an initial Time Machine setup, to encrypting Time Machine backups, to restoring specific files from those backups.
* Time Machine is a great tool that every OS X user should become intimately familiar with, and in this roundup, we’ll revisit each of the topics covered over the last couple of months.

* Setting up Time Machine is a breeze, and we showed you how in our initial tutorial. It’s also important for you to learn how to encrypt your Time Machine backups, as encryption keeps your backed up data safe from prying eyes.
* And since space is usually limited, you’ll want to learn how to exclude certain files and folders from being backed up to your Time Machine external drive. You’ll, of course, also want to learn how to view and restore specific files backed up with Time Machine.
