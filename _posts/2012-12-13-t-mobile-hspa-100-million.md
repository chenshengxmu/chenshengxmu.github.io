* With its now-confirmed 2013 iPhone launch looming, T-Mobile continues its aggressive rollout of its HSPA+ network today with launches in Chicago, Illinois, Reno, Nevada, and Sacramento, California, along with enhancements in other areas.
* Just last Monday, the carrier activated the iPhone-friendly network in several major cities including Atlanta, Seattle and Minneapolis. And with the new areas added today, that network now covers more than 100 million users throughout the US…
* Here’s a list of the areas that were added to T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network earlier today (via 9to5Mac):
* What T-Mobile has done here is actually pretty impressive. As the only major carrier in the US without the iPhone, it was bleeding customers. Then in June it announced that it would be testing out an HSPA+ network at WWDC, which would let iPhone users experience fast 3G data. And since then, it’s managed to rollout that network to over 100 million customers. What is that, 6 months?
* Now, combine this new network with T-Mobile’s iPhone launch next year, and its recently unveiled Value plans (starting at $69.99 for unlimited everything), and all of a sudden you’ve got quite the interesting alternative to some of the bigger carriers.
* What do you think?
