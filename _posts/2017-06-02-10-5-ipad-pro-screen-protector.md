* A screen protector for the rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro has surfaced on Amazon ahead of Apple’s WWDC keynote on Monday. It’s made by popular accessory manufacturer Anker and is available for overnight delivery.
* It’s not unusual for accessories like this to pop up ahead of expected device announcements, but for a company as large as Anker to feel confident enough in pre-lease info to advertise and ship them is far less common.
* Apple is widely believed to introduce a new 10.5-inch iPad on stage during its keynote next week. The tablet is said to have a footprint the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad, with slimmer bezels, and various other upgrades.

* There are two customer reviews here: 1 5-star review where the user said they purchased this for the new iPad, and 1 1-star review where the user apparently tried to cut it to fit a smaller tablet. It’s glass, so it…shattered. Weird.
* Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo gives the rumored iPad a 70% of being unveiled next week, and multiple reports claim Apple has ramped up production on the device. We’ve also seen alleged cases for the 10.5″ tablet.
* Join us Monday for full coverage of Apple’s WWDC keynote and all subsequent announcements.
