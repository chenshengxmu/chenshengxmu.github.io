* Twitter today announced a major overhaul, making the app feel lighter, faster and easier to use with faster navigation via a new side menu, bolder headlines, revamped icons and more.
* The new side navigation menu lets you quickly access your profile, accounts, settings and privacy. As a bonus, you can now add filters and stickers on your profile image, if you’d like.
* Tweets now update dynamically with Reply, Retweet and Like counts so that you can easily see conversations as they’re happening, in real-time. The app now features support for opening links to articles and websites in Safari’s in-app viewer.

* This lets you log in to websites using your saved Safari passwords and enjoy articles in the browser’s Reader mode, all within the Twitter app.
* New switches in Twitter’s settings interface let you turn on increased color contrast, decided whether or not you’d like links to open in Safari’s Reader View and more.
* Accessibility settings are now in a more prominent location.
* So fresh. So clean. So live.
