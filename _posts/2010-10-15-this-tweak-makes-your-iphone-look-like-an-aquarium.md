* A few months ago we showed you how to turn your iPhone lockscreen into an aquarium. Turns out this tweak wasn’t free and was very buggy. The good news is that we now have another option. It’s called MultiFishLockScreen.
* MultiFishLockScreen is a free tweak available for free on Cydia. This theme was especially developed to animate the lockscreen with a nice submarine view… 
* It is optimized for all iPhone versions, and supports Retina Display.
