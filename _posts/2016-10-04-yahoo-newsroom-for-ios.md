* It’s business as usual for the struggling Internet pioneer Yahoo which today released a brand new free of charge iPhone and iPad application, called Newsroom. The app provides curated stories and news content relevant to you and sports built-in social sharing features, personalized feeds and more. The 96.9-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 9 or later and is available at no charge from the App Store.
* In Newsroom, you can hit the Explore tab to find a range of topics, called Vibes. The more Vibes you follow, or post stories into them, the more tailored the app will become to your interests. You can choose from over 200 Vibes from a wide variety of sources: Yahoo, Buzzfeed, Wall Street Journal, NPR, Bloomberg, Huffington Post, among others.
