* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app Day One Journal. For the next 7 days, you can snag the popular journaling app for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $5.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* It’s hard to make the best even better, but the sequel to Day One lives up to expectations—and then some. The app smartly keeps its interface streamlined but adds a wealth of new features that we’ve found immensely valuable. Your journal entries contain all sorts of information—you can geolocate them, add tons of photos to each entry, and even see your day’s fitness activity. You can switch over to a beautiful new photo view when you’re ready to see your world at a glance. 
* And here’s a promotional clip for the app:
* Day One Journal is available in the App Store for free.
* Note: along with this promotion, it appears that Day One Journal has decided to launch a subscription service called Day One Premium. You can read all of the details here, but my understanding is that all of the features in this app will still work without a subscription.
