* Last month, word got out that Apple had won a bid for a colossal tablet deal with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The district, which is the second-largest in the country, agreed to buy some $30 million worth of iPads.
* Today comes more details about the massive tablet rollout. According to a new report from CITEWorld, the LAUSD plans to distribute over 30,000 free iPads to students this school year in an effort to improve education…
* From the report:
* “Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District will receive 31,000 free iPads this school year under a new $30 million program launched by the district. The goal is to improve education and get them ready for the workforce with new technology skills they are not getting at home.
* The first 31,000 iPads are only the initial phase of the program, which plans to buy and distribute iPads to all 640,000 students in the nation’s second-largest school district by late 2014, Mark Hovatter, the chief facilities executive for the LAUSD, told CITEworld.”
* Apparently, the first deployment phase is already underway in 49 of the district’s 1,000+ schools. Each student is getting an iPad pre-loaded with educational apps and digital textbooks that will help them complete their schoolwork.
* The decision to buy the students iPads came after a long review process. Twelve proposals came in from vendors, including Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft, which were meticulously analyzed by a team of 30 people, says Havatter.
* As it makes inroads into enterprise and government sectors, Apple continues to show interest in the education field as well. Last year, the company hosted a New York event where it launched iBooks 2 and a new Textbook initiative.
