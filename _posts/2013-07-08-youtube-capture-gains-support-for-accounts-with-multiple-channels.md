* The Internet giant Google today released a maintenance update to its YouTube Capture app used to record clips on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices and upload them in the YouTube-friendly format to the video sharing service. The biggest improvement in YouTube Capture version 1.5 is support for YouTube accounts with multiple channels.
* This is no doubt going to appeal to prolific YouTube creators such as our own Jeff Benjamin whose how-to, hands-on and walkthrough videos regularly score high view counts (and some people even fall in love with the sound of Jeff’s wonderful radio voice).
* This edition of YouTube Capture additionally features general improvements and fixes and better uploading on iOS 5 devices…
* What needs to happen is ASAP, Google, is folding the standalone YouTube and YouTube Capture apps into one.
* The previous update from May has brought out faster launch speeds, HD preview of enhancements, the ability to tell the app to only upload on Wi-Fi – useful for those on metered data plans – and a UI tweak showing the time remaining during the upload process.
* You can download the universal YouTube Capture app from the App Store.
