* In continuing with the lockscreen tweak trend we’ve been seeing lately, here’s LockLyrics. This jailbreak package enables users to view song lyrics on — you guessed it — the lockscreen.
* Sure, you can view lyrics for your favorite tracks in the iPod app. There are even utilities that allow you to call up song lyrics with an Activator function. But LockLyrics does have its advantages…
* LockLyrics doesn’t add any icons to your springboard and there aren’t any settings to mess with. Once installed, song lyrics can be accessed from the lockscreen by simply double-tapping the home key.
* As usual, the lyrics need to be pre-loaded into your tracks before this will work. You can do that by right-clicking on a song in iTunes, selecting Get Info, and then the Lyrics tab.
* This is another one of those tweaks that has a specific audience. But for folks that are interested, LockLyrics works well, and is available in the Cydia Store for $0.99.
* What do you think of LockLyrics?
