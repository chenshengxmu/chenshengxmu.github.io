* The online retail giant Amazon on Tuesday refreshed its Instant Video iOS client for the iPhone and iPad with iOS 8 compatibility and native support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus display sizes.
* Aside from these compatibility fixes, the release adds a pair of enhancements aimed at improving your video-watching experience.
* The latest version 2.9 is available free of charge in the App Store, arriving a month following version 2.8 which brought us a brand new search history feature and quick resume capability.
* Have you ever wished that Instant Video let you continue right where you left off in the season? Well now you can, thanks to a brand new play button for TV seasons.
* In addition, the app now shows a handy scene preview when scrolling to a different point in video so you can locate the scene more easily than before.
* Back in June, Intant Video picked up new playback controls and content from HBO while adding the ability for non-Prime members to stream the first episodes of select TV shows for free (with ads).
* Amazon Instant Video 2.9 changelog:
* Keep in mind that the new play button and scene previews are supported on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad compatible with iOS 6.0 or later.
* Native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus along with improvements for iOS 8 requires, of course, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system.
* The 38.1-megabyte universal app is available free in the App Store.
* If you like Amazon’s Instant Video service and are a Prime member, this app should be a no-brainer, despite the fact that Amazon is still working on adding some original content.
