* Following Verizon Wireless CEO, Dan Mead’s remarks regarding the short lines on Verizon’s iPhone 4 launch day, Mead also indicated that Apple will eventually offer mobile products that can use Verizon’s Long Term Evolution (LTE) 4G network.
* This lines up perfectly with the speculation earlier this month that Apple was working on an LTE iPhone…
* You’ll see more coming from Apple on LTE. They understand the value proposition of LTE and I feel very confident that they are going to be a part of it.
* Although Mead did not mention any specific product or timeframe as to when the LTE Apple product(s) will be released, we would think it would most likely be the next-generation iPad and, or next-generation iPhone 5. Considering Apple’s iPad 2 event is next week, could it be a coincidence?
* Bouncing back to the LTE iPhone 5 possibility, if Verizon released an LTE iPhone 5, would that mean AT&T would have its own version of the iPhone 5 running on its HSPA+ 4G network?
* What do you think?
