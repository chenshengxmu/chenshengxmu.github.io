* Apple has slowed production and lowered its expected shipment volume of the GSM and CDMA iPhone 4. This move is expected to correlate with a new iPhone release in September, with production of the new device starting in August.
* The dubbed ‘iPhone 4S‘ is expected to have an 8 megapixel camera made by OmniVision and Largan Precision. It is also rumored to sport a A5 dual-core processor with support for T-Mobile and Sprint…
* Digitimes,
* “Due to an inventory volume of 1.5-2 million units of iPhone 4 and the launch of iPhone 4S planned as early as September 2011, Apple has lowered its expected shipment volume of iPhone 4 for the second quarter of 2011 from 20 million units, to 17.5-18 million units consisting of 16 million units of the 3G version and 1.5-2 million units of the CDMA version, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers.”
* We’ve heard previous reports from sources, like Reuters, that have pegged the next iPhone’s release in this same time frame. It seems safe to assume a September launch with a coinciding Apple event.
* iOS 5 will be previewed this June at WWDC, and is expected to launch alongside new iPhone hardware.
* Apple slowing production of the current iPhone 4 only helps affirm a fall release of the iPhone 4S. We still don’t know the official nomenclature for Apple’s next iPhone, but ‘4S’ is the best bet right now.
* What do you think? Will we see an iPhone 4S this September?
