* Notability by Ginger Labs launched in the App Store in January of 2011 with a $4.99 price tag. Despite numerous price changes, this nicely done productivity app for the iPhone and iPad has never gone free, up until today.
* Named Apple Editors’ Choice, Notability is now free for a limited time so do yourself a favor and download the app now in the US App Store before it goes back up to its regular price of $2.99…
* Yes, it’s Apple’s latest Free App of the Week.
* As the App Store editorial team explains:
* We rely on this sleek, powerful note-taker to annotate documents, record lectures, sketch illustrations and more. With built-in iCloud support, it’s perfect for keeping notes, documents and doodles up to date on both iPhone and iPad.
* Billed as “a powerful note-taker” on iOS, Notability lets you sketch ideas, annotate documents, sign contracts, complete worksheets, keep a journal, record a lecture, jot travel notes, teach a class and much more.
* Write, illustrate and annotate using gorgeous ink. Notability’s zoom window helps you quickly and clearly draw every detail, while the palm rest protects your notes from unwanted marks. Choose the right pen and paper for any project.
* Type an essay, create an outline, fill out an application, or make a list with Notability’s advanced word processor. Choose a font, style, color, and size that enhances your work. Even place text exactly where you want using text boxes.
* It synchronizes your notes across devices through iCloud, supports auto-backups to Dropbox, Box, Google Drive or webDAV and will replay everything you type or create so you can kinda go back in time and change anything.

* The latest 5.2 update has enabled a few nice-to-haves like viewing a definition of a typed word, playing back audio recordings at several different speeds, a new navigation tool to jump to a specific point in your recording or scroll through your notes while preventing stray marks and more.
* Everything that you add is now linked to your audio recording – just tap play and watch your handwriting, typing, drawings, and photos come to life.
* This visually rich presentation of your note provides an awesome new way to review your notes or even to create lessons or instructional notes for students or colleagues.
* Download Notability in the App Store, free for a limited time.
* The app currently has a 4.5 out of 5 stars from nearly 11,000 ratings on the App Store.
