* Apple has just released iOS 7.0.4 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Along with the usual bug fixes and stability improvements, iOS 7.0.4 fixes a bug which would sometimes prevent users from making a FaceTime call.
* The update is available over the air, directly from Settings > General > Software Update, or by plugging your device in iTunes…
* Apple also pushed out an iOS 6.1.5 update for owners of fourth generation iPod touch, also to bring a fix to the aforementioned FaceTime bug, and and update to the Apple TV firmware, bringing it to version 6.0.2.
* Hacker iH8sn0w has confirmed that the update is safe for jailbreakers as iOS 7.0.4 doesn’t bring any security changes.
* As always, you can find all iOS software versions, including the latest iOS 7.0.4 on our download page.
