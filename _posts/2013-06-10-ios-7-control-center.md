* Now that Apple has formally announced a Jony Ive-ified iOS 7 (“it’s like having a new phone, but one you already know how to use,” said Tim Cook), executives here on stage at San Francisco’s Moscone West are telegraphing the key features of iOS 7. One of such handy additions is an all-new Control Center. So, what does it do?
* Control Center gives you quick access to the controls and apps you always seem to need right this second. Just swipe up from any screen — including the Lock screen — to do things like switch to Airplane mode, turn Wi-Fi on or off, or adjust the brightness of your display. You can even shine a light on things with a new flashlight. Never has one swipe given you so much control.
* As the name suggests, Control Center puts together your most often used toggles from Settings into one view that’s accessible anywhere in the system.

* Swiping up from the bottom of the device brings up a gorgeous new overlay with handy switches for Airplane mode, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Sleep and access to more toggles in the Settings app.
* You can also adjust your brightness and volume level, control your media with buttons to sip to previous or next and the play/pause button.
* Right below thse are controls for AirPlay and AirDrop.
* Aligned right across the bottom are app-specific icons to access your Camera app, Calculator, Alarm clock (hopefully, these can be configured).
* Oh, and Control Center now gives you access to an all-new flashlight functionality so no more fiddling with the Camera app to enable LED flash.
* Jailbreak tweak developers won’t like Control Center, I think.
* So, what do you think of the new Control Center?
