* MG Siegler, a well-known (and certainly well-connected) TechCrunch columnist, blogger, Google Ventures partner and Apple pundit, has gotten us pretty excited by tweeting a month ago that a new Apple TV hardware might be on tap for tomorrow’s iPad event.
* Although the $99 set-top box is ripe for refresh – the current third-generation 1080p model was introduced 593 days ago – we have literally seen no components leaking out of Apple’s supply chain to suggest an imminent update, which had prompted us to take the columnist’s claim with a few pinches of salt.
* Changing his tune, he now claims a major hardware revamp “has been delayed a bit,” which however doesn’t mean we won’t see an Apple TV update tomorrow…
* “I guess those excited about a software refresh in a week are gonna be *really* excited when new Apple TV hardware is unveiled next month,” reads Siegler’s September 21 tweet.
* This past Saturday, “pouring a small amount of water” on his original tweet, he said:
* While I still haven’t heard anything concrete, the most recent whispers I have heard is that the Apple TV project has been delayed a bit. 
* Originally, I had heard this new-style Apple TV (not an actual television, by the way) was slated for sometime around this November.
* Nonetheless, Siegler goes on to speculate we still might see a minor Apple TV refresh at the iPad event tomorrow, basically “an updated unit with a spec bump or something”.
* “But the thing to be more excited about, the device with some sort of newfangled control system, doesn’t seem like it’s ready just yet,” he cautioned.
* The Wall Street Journal (and pretty much everyone else) is expecting a thinner and lighter iPad 5 and a Retina iPad mini tomorrow. The newspaper-owned technology blog, AllThingsD, is also betting on a Haswell-based update to the MacBook Pro lineup which, however, could as well be communicated through a press release and a silent website update (like the recent iMac update).
* If you talk to the reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPads will share Apple’s improved eight-megapixel iSight camera and will not incorporate the Touch ID sensor. The iPad 5 should run Apple’s in-house designed A7X chip, with the A7 variant driving the Retina iPad mini, Kuo said.
* A new Apple-made, Surface-like iPad keyboard cover could be in the cards, too.

* Last but not least, Apple should share some software related developments at the event, including announcing OS X Mavericks and iOS 7.1 availability and showing off iOS 7-style updates to its iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suite, respectively.
* Yesterday, Apple silently issued a new OS X Mavericks Gold Master (build 13A603), less than three weeks following the original Gold Master seed (build 13A598).
* Apple’s event kicks off at 10am PST tomorrow.
* To get you up to speed, we have a roundup of what to expect from the show.
