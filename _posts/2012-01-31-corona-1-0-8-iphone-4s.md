title: Corona Updated to Bring Support for iPhone 4S on iOS 5.0
---
* It’s a big day for Corona. After being updated this morning to fix the DRM issues in iBooks, Saurik just tweeted that the untether has been updated yet again, this time to resolve problems with the iPhone 4S running iOS 5.
* Corona 1.0-8: @sbingner noticed that 1.0-6/7 failed on iPhone 4S 5.0 (the only supported 5.0 build; absinthe’s Corona had worked): fixed. 🙁

* If you’re having problems with iBooks on your jailbroken device, you can install Corona directly from Cydia. If you’ve already installed Corona, you can simply update it via Cydia and you should be good to go.
