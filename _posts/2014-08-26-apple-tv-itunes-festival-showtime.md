* Two nice updates for Apple TV owners today. First, Apple has re-launched the iTunes Festival channel on the $99 media-streming box in time for the 2014 iTunes Festival, which kicks off on September 1 in London.
* And second, the firm has also added the Showtime Anytime channel to the device.
* Showtime is a premium cable network offering some free content to all users, in addition to live and on-demand shows and events to those who’ve subscribed to the network through a participating cable provider.
* Additional content sources have been added to the Apple TV in select markets, as outlined after the jump.
* According to 9to5Mac, the device has also gained the SVT Play channel in Sweden and public broadcaster NRK in Norway.
* SVT Play, which also has an iOS app available, is an on-demand video service run by broadcaster Sveriges Television.
* According to the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, its Apple TV channel offers 40,000 programs on-demand, free to all users. Both channels are available to Apple TV owners in Sweden and Norway starting today.
* As reported by MacRumors, the addition of the Showtime Anytime network brings such shows as Californication, Dexter, Homeland, House of Lies, Ray Donovan, The Tudors and more to the Apple TV.
