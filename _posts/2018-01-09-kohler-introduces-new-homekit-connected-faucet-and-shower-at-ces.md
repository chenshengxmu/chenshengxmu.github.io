* At CES this week, Kohler took the wraps off a collection of new smart kitchen and bath products that utilize its Microsoft Azure-based Kohler Konnect platform. They will also support Apple’s HomeKit and Siri when they launch.
* While others are in the pipeline, Kohler’s Sensate kitchen faucet and the DTV+ shower system will be the first two to support Apple’s HomeKit platform.
* The Sensate faucet allows you better control of your water, letting you monitor usage and track consumption. It also lets you turn the water on or off, and dispense the water to a specific volume. Say you throw your pasta pot on their and use a voice command to ask for 3 quarts of water while you continue cooking.

* The DTV+ shower system on the other hand will allow owners to customize their shower experience, which each user able to have their own presets. Using the Kohler Konnect app, you can customize the sound, lights, water, and steam.
* This isn’t the first HomeKit connected shower we’ve seen at CES, as Moen has also announced their version this year.
* While these are the only two products to support HomeKit out of the gate, they are bringing Amazon’s Alexa to their Verdera mirror.
* Other members of Kohler’s Konnect platform include the Numi intelligent toilet, PureWarmth toilet seat, and the PerfectFill bathtub technology.
* The Verdera mirror will be out in March of this year, but we are still waiting for pricing and availability on the rest.
