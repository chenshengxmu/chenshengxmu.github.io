* Beta 4 of iOS 11.3 was released today, and with it, a smattering of tweaks as we get closer to release. Check out our hands-on video to see what has changed.
* Unfortunately, it looks as though AirPlay 2 is still no where to be seen, after being removed in the previous beta.

* Some notable bugs were fixed in this beta, such as the inability for a computer to recognize a connected device.
* The reading app has also been renamed once more, back to the original “iBooks” title. In beta 1, the app was actually renamed “Books”.
* There have been persistent rumors that Apple is looking to revamp the iBooks application with a new name and design. Since the name has been reverted, perhaps that change is being held off for a forthcoming update.
* Apple pushing things like AirPlay 2 and the iBooks redesign back isn’t surprising with their newfound focus on quality and stability over quantity of new features.
* That doesn’t mean iOS 11.3 is a boring update. It is chock full of new features including Messages in iCloud, Health Records with partnering medical networks, several new Animoji, and more.
* Check out our hands-on with beta 3 to see what changed last time.
* What do you think of beta 3? Did you install it? Let us know down in the comments.
