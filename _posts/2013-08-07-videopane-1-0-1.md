* Last night we brought you a video walkthrough of the just released VideoPane tweak. The initial release, which allows users to detach video for multitasking while watching video, was solid, yet contained a few lingering issues.
* The first big issue was the lack of Netflix support. In all actuality the Netflix support was there, but it didnâ€™t work with the latest version of Netflix. The update also adds a much needed dedicated settings pane to the fray.
* There are quite a few additional changes for VideoPane 1.0.1. Have a look at the full change log inside.

* Here is the full change log for VideoPane 1.0.1:
* My experience with this latest version of VideoPane went much better than the first version I tried yesterday. For starters, Netflix works just as advertised now. I also really appreciate the fact that you can now detach videos using an Activator gesture, meaning that you no longer have to worry about the obtrusive pop-up that hindered the initial version.
* The Ressurect Pane feature was fixed, I found that it tended to crash on me with version 1.0. Overall, I find that the tweak is much more stable, and it works with any type of video I can throw at it.
* If VideoPane 1.0 was an 8/10, this latest version is a surefire 9/10. If you were on the fence about purchasing it before, you can safely get off the fence now.
* Let me know what you think in the comments section about the latest update.
