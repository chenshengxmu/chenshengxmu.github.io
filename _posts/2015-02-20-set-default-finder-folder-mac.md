* I don’t know about you, but I find macOS’ All My Files folder to be excruciatingly annoying and I cringe any time I accidentally visit this folder. I dislike it so much that I’ve completely removed it from my side bar on the Finder.
* By default, Apple actually makes users visit the All My Files folder whenever a new Finder window is opened. Needless to say, this is one of the first things that I alter upon installing macOS.
* I usually have my Finder window default to the Desktop whenever opening a new window, but you can use the following tutorial to designate any folder of your choice as the Finder default. Perhaps you like to start work from the Documents folder, or some other work-designated folder. No sweat, you can change it by doing the following:
* Step 1: open Finder
* Step 2: click Finder in the menu bar and select Preferences

* Step 3: Under the General tab, find the New Finder windows show heading, and use the drop down box to select a preferred default Finder window location. If your preferred location isn’t already listed, you can use the Other option to navigate to a specific spot on your Mac.

* While we’re at it, you might as well click the SideBar tab at the top of the preferences window and uncheck the All My Files option under the Favorites heading to completely rid yourself of the All My Files folder.

* It only takes a second, but you’d be surprised at how many people keep using the Finder with its default out of the box settings. Change your Finder default landing location, and make your workflow that much smoother. After that, be sure to share any suggestions, thoughts, or opinions down in the comment section that follows.
