* Okay, so I’m switching gears a bit here and talking about an app that you can download from the App Store.
* Make no mistake, while I love jailbreak apps and tweaks, I also have love for many apps that can be found in the App Store.
* The App Store is loaded with myriads of quality apps, and Panic’s Prompt is one of them. Prompt is an SSH client, and a perfect alternative to Mobile Terminal for hardcore terminal users.
* Did you know It also allows you to browse the root structure of your iDevice’s file system if you’re jailbroken and have OpenSSH installed?
* Step 1: Purchase, download and install Prompt.
* Step 2: Download and install OpenSSH from Cydia.
* Step 3: Open Prompt, and use the following settings to connect to your iPhone’s root file structure.
* We’ve already gone in depth about what’s to like about Prompt before, so if you’re interested in some of its features give it a read.
* I know it’s expensive, but would you consider using Prompt as a Mobile Terminal alternative? As a big fan of Panic’s apps, for me that’s a resounding “yes.”
