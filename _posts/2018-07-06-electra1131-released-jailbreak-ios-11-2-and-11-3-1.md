* Electra Team member Pwn20wnd announced via Twitter on Friday that the team’s iOS 11.2-11.3.1 jailbreak tool would be coming “really soon,” and soon after, the official Electra web page received a notable revamp with download links.
* As we can see, there are two versions of the Electra1131 jailbreak tool: 1) a developer version that uses a multipath tcp exploit and requires a developer account to be used, and 2) a regular version that uses a vcf exploit and doesn’t require a developer account.
* Electra1131 can jailbreak iOS 11.2-11.3.1 devices and will install Cydia during the jailbreak process. Citing Pwn20wnd, an issue with ‘low storage’ errors was fixed before release, so users shouldn’t experience problems in this regard.

* More importantly, those running iOS 11.3 and 11.3.1 will need to reboot their device after running Electra1131 to “apply the remount-related patches.” iOS 11.2.x users needn’t bother with rebooting their device afterward, as they aren’t affected by it.
* As we learned from CoolStar just a few days ago, Electra1131 automagically filters incompatible jailbreak tweaks from appearing in Cydia’s default repositories: BigBoss, ModMyi, and ZodTTD. This prevents users from installing incompatible add-ons and preserves the jailbreak from potential hazards in the process.
* Assuming you followed our advice last month and jumped to iOS 11.3.1 when you could, you can now jailbreak your iPhone or iPad. *Cheers*
