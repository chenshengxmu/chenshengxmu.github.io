* Digging deeper into the HomePod firmware code, Steven Troughton-Smith has seemingly confirmed that iPhone 8 will boast a three-times resolution screen at 2,436 by 1,125 pixels.
* “It has more screen in height, but it can’t fit the same kinds of data onscreen as iPhone 7 Plus can,” he wrote on Twitter. The device’s alleged Retina pixel count aligns perfectly with what KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo originally predicted back in February.
* The numbers work out to about 521 pixels per inch, up from the iPhone 7 Plus’s 5.5-inch full HD display at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels and 401 pixels per inch. The 2,436 by 1,125 pixel resolution applies to the handset’s so-called active display are—that is, the canvas dedicated to apps.
* An additional Touch Bar-like area at the bottom should host a virtual Home button along with persistent shortcuts to apps in the Dock. Taken together, the active display area and the bottom area should make for a total of 5.8 inches diagonally at 2,800 by 1,242 pixels.
* Doing the math, that’s a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.
* There are little tidbits in the OS suggesting upcoming iPhone will have a 3x screen at 1125×2436. Hard to gauge what that will mean for devs pic.twitter.com/SK8QjOAfDt

* Earlier this morning, Steven analyzed the HomePod firmware code that Apple “accidentally” posted on its servers to discover that iPhone 8 will indeed feature an advanced facial recognition feature that should work well in dark-lit environments, referred to as “Pearl ID”.
* Upon extracting high-resolution graphics from the HomePod firmware, Steven has even been able to reaffirm the device’s overall form factor with a nearly full-screen front face with an edge-to-edge screen, no physical Home button and a notch at the top that will likely host the earpiece, the front-facing camera and various sensors.
