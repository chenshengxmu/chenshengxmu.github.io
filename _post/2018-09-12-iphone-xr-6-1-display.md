* In addition to the new iPhone Xs and Xs Max models, Apple on Wednesday announced the new iPhone XR. It features a 6.1-inch LCD (not OLED like the Xs and Xs Max) panel that Apple has branded a “Liquid Retina” display, with 1.4 million pixels and a resolution of 1792×828 (326 ppi). 
* From Apple’s press release:
* “iPhone XR helps us reach even more people with the latest iPhone innovations. It is packed with the newest technologies including a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display that goes edge to edge, the latest TrueDepth camera with faster Face ID authentication, new 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with second generation Neural Engine and a 12-megapixel camera that takes advanced Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting photos,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The new iPhone XR has a gorgeous new aerospace-grade aluminum and glass enclosure that has IP67 protection from liquids and dust, long all-day battery life and comes in six beautiful finishes. iPhone XR makes it possible for even more people to have the great experience of the latest iPhone X technology, in beautiful new designs, at a more affordable price.”

* The XR also supports Tap-to-wake, 120Hz touch-sensing, Wide Color and True Tone. It has the same TrueDepth camera with Advanced Face ID as the iPhone Xs, as well as the A12 Bionic processor. The rear camera has just a single lens, but it’s a 12MP sensor with OIS, Smart HDR and Advanced Bokeh support.
* The XR starts at $749 and comes in a handful of exciting new colors. You’ll have to wait a bit for one however, with pre-orders not beginning until October 19.
