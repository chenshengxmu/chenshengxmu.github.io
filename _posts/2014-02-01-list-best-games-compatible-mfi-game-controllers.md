title: iPhone games with controller support
---
* When Apple demonstrated iOS 7 in June of 2013, one of the unmentioned, but highly talked about features that would be added was the MFi game controller SDK, which allows third-party developers to create external game pads for iOS.

* Of course, we’ve talked about the subject quite a bit in the past eight months. However, one of the things we haven’t talked as much about is related to games that can be played with MFi (Made for iPhone) controllers. Well, today we have a list of the best iPhone games with controller support for iOS 7, and we think are the cream of the crop…
* We have listed some of our favorite MFi-compatible games first, but we also have a long list of Made For iPhone game with controller support below. Note that this is a growing list of games that will periodically be updated.
* Arguably the most popular GTA game, and possibly one of the most popular driving games in history finally made its way to the App Store late last year. Players are able to take out their violent tendencies on corrupt executives, greedy drug lords, and irritating passersby. The game features more than 70 hours of campaign gameplay. Plus, listen to customized playlists and take advantage of the dual stick controls for full camera movement. This game is available for $6.99.

* This is another sequel that was a huge hit with fans this year. The first season of this episodic adventure was just the beginning. The follow-up looks about the same as its predecessor, but continues the story of young Clementine. What will she do now? Find out how she has faired these past few months in the first episode of the second season. Players are asked to intertwine text-based role-play adventuring with swipe action gameplay. Your decisions will affect the outcome of this story, so be careful. This game is available for $4.99.

* This Zelda-like game made huge waves this year when it launched in the App Store. Some gamers were excited about this epic adventure. Others blasted it as nothing but a clone of Zelda. What the majority were saying was that, no matter whether it was just co-opting a preexisting game or paying homage to the greats, this is a title worthy of the high download price. This game is available for $8.99.

* This popular puzzle platformer has been a hit with iOS users since it first launched. In September, the devs added iOS 7 game controller support, so now you can plan out your adventure with even more usability. Players help a lonely boy, searching for his missing sister and a way out of a dark world. As you move from one scene to another, you will be faced with difficult obstacles that require puzzle-solving skills. If you aren’t careful, you may end up dead. This game is available for $4.99.

* Oh man, when this game first launched, I spent hours playing through all three titles on my iPad. Man, do I wish I had a game controller at that time. I ended up with sore thumbs and cramped wrists. This collection includes the first title, The Revenge, and The Rosetta Stone. There are two game modes, Arcade, which is just like it was when it originally launched, and Story, which unlocks new stages and achievements while playing. Listen along with either the original 8-bit soundtrack, or upgrade your audio with the brand new, remastered version. This game is available for $2.99.

* This follow up sequel to the original tower attack game is even more intense than its predecessor. Using cutting edge technology and advanced graphics, you won’t be able to tell reality from video game play as you advance on the invading alien forces. The story-driven campaign will set you on a path of destruction that will lead to different endings, depending on what you choose. There are thousands of tactical combinations. Play online multiplayer to choose between towers and troops. This game is available for $4.99.

* Killing zombies is more exiting than ever with this free-to-play game. Another sequel, this follow up title has better graphics, more content, and plenty of gut-splattering fun. Players take part in real-time story development, participate in global missions, and earn exclusive in-game rewards. Hook up with the Gunsmith, Medic, Scientist, Smuggler, and Engineer to unlock new weapons and gadgets. This game is available for free.

* This tiny tactical shooter lets gamers take down waves of enemies by blasting them with awesome upgradable weapons. There are 30 randomly generated levels and 10 ranged weapons that can be upgraded using in-game coins. The five melee weapons let players hack enemies to bits with epic attacks. Develop your fighter’s specializations for either soldier, engineer, or medic. The game is cross-platform for co-operative multiplayer mode with up to four others. This game is available for $1.99.

* 2013 was a very good year for sequels. Unlike many movies, these sequels don’t suck. The majority of them are so much better than their predecessors that the earlier games look like junk in comparison. This one is an example of what can be done with great graphics, streamlined features, and smooth gameplay. This 3D space combat game combines the battle of starships with trading simulation. Mine for rare minerals, sell to the highest bidder, and fight pirate miners who want your goods. This game is available for free.

* This is one of my favorite iOS games. Not because of any outstanding graphics or arcade action, but because of the hilarious gags. This game is a port of the 2004 PlayStation 2 title. It features Cary Elwes of Princess Bride fame voice acting as The Bard. The sarcastic and greedy songwriter has a hankering for something other than adventure. Fame and fortune is only part of the fun. The role-playing adventure has you controlling the quests of the amoral Bard as he drinks and fights his way to the next task. This game is on sale for $2.99.
