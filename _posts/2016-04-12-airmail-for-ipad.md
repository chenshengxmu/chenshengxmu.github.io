* Airmail, the popular Mac email client, has made the leap to the iPhone back in February.
* As of today, this powerful email application is available with a native interface on iPads, with full support for iOS 9’s Split View multitasking mode, wireless keyboards with fully customizable shortcuts, Touch ID, the ability to draw sketches within the app and much more.
* “Never before has e-mail been so powerful and productive across your Apple devices,” developers told me via email. “Use the extended screen real estate to compose and communicate like never before.”
* The refreshed iPhone and iPad app is available now in the App Store at no charge for existing users.
* In Airmail 1.1 for iOS, your saved search can be turned into smart folders, which is very convenient. Read receipts are now available, too, as is the Send Later feature (which has been available in the desktop edition of Airmail) for scheduled emails on Gmail and Exchange accounts.
* Other enhancements include extended recipients, the ability to set the root folder for IMAP accounts, the Reply/Reply All detection switch, a new two-finger swipe to the next message, the Archive and Star options on the Lock screen and more.
* The app’s built-in actions have been expanded with four new items: unsubscribe newsletters, add to contacts, full screen and two-finger long-press on a message. As for third-party integrations, Airmail 1.1 introduces support for Due, Proud, Readdle Calendar and PDF Expert5, Byword, Parcel, Instapaper and Pocket Informant.
* iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus owners can take advantage of 3D Touch shortcuts on Airmail’s Home screen menu and Peek/Pop gestures for previewing their emails.
* Airmail for iOS requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 9.0 or later.
* The apps lacks support for the Apple Watch and is localized in English, Arabic, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Turkish and Ukrainian.
* Airmail is $4.99 in the App Store.
* The Mac edition of Airmail is $9.99 in the Mac App Store.
