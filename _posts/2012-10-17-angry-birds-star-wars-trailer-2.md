title: Rovio teases Angry Birds Star Wars
---
* Angry Birds Star Wars the game is landing on November 8 for iOS and Android and Rovio just posted a nice-looking new trailer to promote the software. It doesn’t reveal much in way of details, but sure as hell appeals to fans of Star Wars.
* And as part of its broader partnership with toy and board game company Hasbro, Rovio and Hasbro pledged to release Star Wars and Angry Birds-themed merchandise and various mashups, including board games, costumes, plush toys and much more…
* And here’s the previous teaser trailer.
* Rovio jokes that Angry Birds Star Wars will be here “in less than 12 parsecs”.
* What’s a parsec?
* Wikipedia is your friend.
* Hopefully Angry Birds Star Wars is as entertaining and challenging as Angry Birds Space, Bad Piggies and Amazing Alex.
* More information about the game is available at the official web site.
* In addition to iOS and Android versions, Rovio will release Angry Birds Star Wars on Windows Phone, Kindle Fire, Mac and PCs running Windows 8.
* I understand many people are growing tired of the whole Angry Birds phenomenon, especially with Rovio milking the franchise for all it’s worth, but as long as they continue making addictive games I really don’t care.
* Judging from this trailer, is Angry Birds Star Wars a game you’d like to play?
