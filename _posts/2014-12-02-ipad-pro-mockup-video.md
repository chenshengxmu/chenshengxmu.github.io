* Thanks to YouTube user Canoopsy (via Nowhereelse.fr), we now have a good sense of the size of Apple’s allegedly upcoming ‘iPad Pro’. The mockup video depicts how a 12.2-inch iPad would stack up against the current-generation current iPads, iPhones and 13-inch MacBook Pro in terms of size. The video is included after the break so give it a quick watch and meet us in comments.
* Here it is.
* According to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, Apple may have delayed launch of an oversized iPad into the second quarter of 2015, citing manufacturing difficulties.
* It’s been long thought that the iPad Pro would incorporate a 12.9-inch display, but the fairly accurate Japanese blog Macotakara recently claimed that Apple had opted for a slightly smaller 12.2-inch screen.
* That notion was then corroborated by the Japanese magazine Mac Fan which posted what appears to be schematics of a 12.2-inch ‘iPad Air Plus’ with dimensions of 305.31mm x 220.8mm x 7mm (12 inches x 8.7 inches x 0.28 inches).
* So, after watching this mockup video do we really need a bigger iPad?
