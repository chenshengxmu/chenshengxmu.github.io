* SEC filings have confirmed that Apple partnered recently with a company called GT Advanced which operates a manufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona that makes sapphire components. We also know for a fact that Apple prepaid more than half a billion dollars to buy sophisticated furnaces and equipment for the plant, securing multi-year output of sapphire parts on an exclusive basis.
* Manufacture of sapphire components commenced recently, according to sources. Now, industrial-scale production like this points beyond sapphire components for the Touch ID sensor and the iSight camera lens protection.
* Watchers speculate that Apple’s phablet – an iPhone 6, if you will – has a massive sapphire-hardened 5.5-inch screen. But, a new post on China’s micro-blogging platform cautions that the rising cost of sapphire display production may hinder Apple’s ability to roll out the technology across its entire iOS device lineup…
* This post on Weibo [Google translate, via GforGames] cites supply chain sources as speculating that Apple’s assumed use of thin sapphire sheets to harden the iPhone 6’s 5.5-inch screen may limit handset production over high cost of sapphire as a display material.
* Specifically, Chinese media reports suggest only ten million 5.5-inch iPhone 6 units “throughout the product’s life-cycle.”
* “These latest reports suggest that the sapphire screen costs around 1743 yuan (or $280), which would raise the final cost of the device to about 8000 yuan (or $1285) – at least in China,” notes GforGames.
* By comparison, the off-contract 16GB iPhone 5s costs 5288 yuan in China, or about $850. The 64GB variant is a 6888 yuan value over in China, or $1,106.
* I’d take the report with a pinch of salt – at the reported $280, the iPhone 6’s 5.5-inch sapphire glass cover would be pricier than the entire iPhone 5s bill of materials!
* Besides, it’s been reported before that Apple’s plant should churn out between 100 and 200 million sapphire displays when it reaches full capacity, so…
* Keep in mind that Jefferies analyst Peter Misek said in a research note that Apple has been negotiating with wireless carriers to raise the iPhone 6 price by $100, because the handset will be “the only headline-worthy high-end phone launched this year”.
* This would make the iPhone 6 start at $299 after a two-year contract rather than the $199 like the current iPhone 5s. If our poll is anything to go by, roughly 40 percent of respondents would be willing to pay a $100 extra for a 5.5-inch iPhone 6.

* KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo expects that Apple will reserve the sapphire display for the flagship 64GB version of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6. Kuo has a pretty solid track record: the analyst correctly predicted Apple would use sapphire to protect the iPhone 5s’s fingerprint reader.
* Apple is expected to introduce two large-screened iPhone models this year, one incorporating a 4.7-inch screen and due by Fall, and a larger phablet-class device sporting a 5.5-inch screen.
* Anothere rumor asserted that the larger iPhone got delayed until 2015 over various production issues dealing with ultra-thin battery components.
* What do you think?
* Will Apple limit sapphire use to the iSight/Touch ID protection and small-factor devices such as the iWatch, the iPod nano and so forth?
* Or will it supplant Corning’s Gorilla Glass for the iPhone?
