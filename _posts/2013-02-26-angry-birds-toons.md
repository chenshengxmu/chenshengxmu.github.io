The animated shorts take place on the Piggy Island and invite fans to get up close and personal with their favorite characters. Rovio says it will air a brand new episode featuring the latest adventures of the birds and pigs every week starting the weekend of March 16…

* What makes Bomb Bird so angry? Why is the King Pig the King Pig? And are those mischievous piggies ever going to get hold of the eggs?
* Rovio promised to release additional detail in due time.
