* It was recently suggested that Apple wanted Samsung to pay as much as $2.5 billion in damages for allegedly copying its iOS devices: $500 million in lost profits, $25 million in royalty damages and a whopping $2 billion for the profits Samsung “unjustly received” using Apple’s intellectual property.
* A new report breaks down the figure on a per-device basis, as outlined in an exhibit prepared by accounting consulting firm Invotex Group, which specializes in calculating royalty rates for litigation…
* Josh Ong of The Next Web points us to Apple’s exhibit titled Summary of Apple’s Damages Calculations [PDF download], observing that it outlines four damage scenarios, “ranging from $2.47 billion to $2.88 billion, depending on whether Apple’s lost profits are counted and which patents are included”.
* Here’s a quick summary.

* The experts calculated the above damages based on an extensive table which highlights Apple’s utility patent, design patent and trade dress claims against each of the 28 accused Samsung products.

* The Captivate device, also known as the Galaxy S, absolutely leads with an estimated $204 million in Apple’s lost profits.
* The original Galaxy Tab?
* Just shy of $20 million.
* Also interesting, the Epic 4G smartphone brought Samsung the most profits based on design and trade claims, an estimated $307 million.
* Also worth mentioning, Apple feels it should be entitled to royalties from six devices totaling a little more than $21 million.
* Would you say that those calculations are fair?
