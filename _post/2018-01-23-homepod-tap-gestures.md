* Aside from announcing HomePod’s February 9 availability, Apple’s now updated the official webpage for its $349 Siri-driven wireless speaker with some previously unknown tidbits.
* According to the refreshed webpage, the speaker’s top recognizes the following gestures:
* You’ll know Siri is listening by the LED waveform that animates with your every word.
* Of course, customers can also invoke Siri hands-free by uttering the familiar “Hey Siri” hot phrase. Thanks to its six built-in beam-forming microphone array, HomePod can hear “Hey Siri” from across the room, even when loud music is playing.

* You can adjust touch sensitivity and other HomePod features in Apple’s stock Home app.
* And with Automatic Setup, you can simply hold an iPhone next to your HomePod to transfer relevant settings and accounts to the wireless speaker in seconds.
* Some of the HomePod settings you’ll be able to control in the Home app include:
* It supports multiple user accounts and lets you shut down its always-listening microphones to prevent “Hey Siri” from working, which could be useful in a house party scenario.
* HomePod sends encrypted information to Apple servers using an anonymous Siri identifier that cannot be traced back to you, but only after the “Hey Siri” hot phrase is recognized locally.
