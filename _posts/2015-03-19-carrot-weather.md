* If you’re a fan of Carrot Fit which berates you for keeping or gaining any weight or Carrot Alarm that gets mad at you if you don’t wake up when your alarm goes off, you’re going to have a field day with Carrot Weather.
* The $2.99 iPhone and iPad application, like other Carrot offerings, is centered around a sadistic digital assistant that’s more HAL 9000 than Siri and frequently refers to humans as “meatballs”.
* As you might have guessed by now, Carrot Weather is a weather app with a personality and attitude. But don’t let that put you off: Carrot Weather provides eerily accurate weather data you can trust, spiced up with some hilariously twisted forecasts.
* Carrot Weather is jam-packed with more than two-thousand lines of spoken dialogue aimed at making checking weather an amusing affair.
* “We have a really sarcastic sense of humor, and making fun of each other is always a part of that,” says Carrot apps creator Brian Mueller. “Some of Carrot’s dialogue is things that they’ve said to me in real life.”
* Fans of personalization will jump with joy as Carrot Weather has different themes for every possible weather condition. Topping it all off, there are more that a hundred animated scenes featuring funny creatures like evil penguins.

* Built on Forecast.io’s accurate weather data, the minimalist weather software gives you an at-a-glance overview of your short-term, 24-hour and seven-day forecasts.
* For those wondering, Carrot Weather includes a Today widget which can display current and extended forecast right inside the Notification Center.

* Some of the data points Carrot Weather provides include the “feels like” temperature readings, wind speed and direction, humidity, barometric pressure and visibility.

* The app motivates you to use it on a daily basis by providing exotic locations that can be unlocked just by using it, like Mount Doom, Nakatomi Plaza, the Moon and more.
* Carrot Weather highlights:
* The 10.7-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later. If you’re interested in other Carrot-branded apps, our own Lory Gil has posted exhaustive reviews of Carrot Fit and Carrot Alarm.
* Carrot Weather is available at a special launch weekend discount of 25 percent for $2.99 in the App Store.
