* Instagram yesterday announced a new Events channel in the Explore section of its free of charge iPhone app. Currently limited to users within the United States and resembling Snapchat’s Discover channel with Live Stories, it brings in one place all of the photos and videos posted on the service during specific events, such as concerts, sports games and more. Like the rest of Explore, the new Events channel is personalized for you and highlights events you might like.
* Posts are selected automatically based on things like the people you follow, the posts you like and your personal preferences.
* The Facebook-owned service has promised to bring Events to the rest of the world soon. In the meantime, you can learn more about it in the Instagram Help Center.
* Earlier this week, Instagram released a small update improving its built-in camera for the recently launched Stories feature. The update lets you zoom with one hand as you’re recording a video (slide your finger up/down while holding the video record button), switch camera mode while recording a video (double-tap to flip between the front and back camera) and more.
* Download Instagram for free from the App Store.
