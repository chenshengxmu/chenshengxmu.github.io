* Instagram recently rolled out a handy archival feature for your old photos and videos you don’t want to scrap completely. Called Archive, it basically moves the selected post into a space that’s visible only to you. The post isn’t deleted permanently, it’s simply moved to a private place only you can see and disappears from your profile so that no one can see it.
* “Your profile is a representation of who you are and evolves with you over time,” says the company. “With Archive, you now have more flexibility to shape your profile while still preserving moments that matter.”
* This feature requires Instagram for iOS version 10.21 or higher so be sure to update your copy of Instagram to the latest available version before using the archival features.
* Anything your previously shared on Instagram can be archived.
* 1) Launch Instagram on your iPhone.
* 2) Go to the Profile section by tapping the rightmost tab at the bottom.
* 3) Find the previously shared post you’d like to archive, then tap Instagram’s “…” menu at the top of the post and choose the Archive option from the menu.

* This action hides the selected post from your profile page and makes it so your followers and other people on Instagram can’t see it.
* TIP: You can also press the post with 3D Touch, then swipe up to reveal options and choose the Archive option from the shortcuts menu.

* You can see your archived posts at any time.
* 1) Launch Instagram on your iPhone.
