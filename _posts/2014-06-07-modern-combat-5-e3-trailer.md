* After going nearly a year after its initial announcement without talking about the title, Gameloft is finally starting to open up about Modern Combat 5: Blackout. We’ve learned a number of new details about the game over the past couple of weeks, and today we have an epic new E3 trailer to share…
* The single player campaign in MC5 begins in Venice, Italy where Phoenix (the main character) is sent on a special operation to secure a transport of WMDs from a particularly well-armed terrorist group. But when things go wrong, he’ll have to travel the globe to convince his allies to help him fight.
* But where MC5 is really going to stand out is multiplayer. Gameloft says the game will be made up of four main multiplayer modes: Capture The Flag, VIP, Free for All and Team Battle. There’s also a new Squad vs. Squad mode that will allow you to join squads with your friends to compete against others.
* MC5 will bring competitive team battles to the next level, with persistent squads formed by players. You can join squads with your friends or any other player you meet online, then take your squad online against other squads from around the world. Strategy and team balancing will be key, and players within a squad will have their own dedicated squad chat to talk to each other and plan their tactics. There is also a global chat function which allows you to talk to anyone. 
* There’s no word on when Modern Combat 5: Blackout will be available, but Gameloft has started using the phrase ‘it’s coming soon.’ It’s expected to be one of the best-looking mobile game releases this year, and we can’t wait to get our hands on it. Hopefully we’ll learn more details at E3 next week.
