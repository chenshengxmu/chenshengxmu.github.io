* macOS’ Reminders app can be used for more than just typing out your own reminders; you can also use it to remind you to read or reply to specific emails at a specific time or date.
* In this tutorial, we’ll be showing you how you can use the Reminders app on your Mac to remind yourself about specific emails you receive in the Mail app.
* So you’ve just received an important email, but you’re way to busy with work to answer it right at this moment in time and you really don’t want to forget to read or answer the email later. What do you do?
* Well, you could create an email-based reminder on your Mac. Not only is this solution going to be simple to carry out, but it’ll also make sure you are reminded about the email at a very specific time or date. With that in mind, you’ll have no excuse to miss the email.
* To set a reminder-based email on your Mac, you need to follow these simple steps:
* 1) Launch the Mail app on your Mac and select an email you wish to be reminded about later.

* Note: The email is added to the Reminders app with a “Show in Mail…” link that launches the email in the Mail app, as shown above.
* 3) Hover your mouse over the email reminder and an i button will appear. Click on it, and you’ll get options for scheduling the reminder for your convenience.

* Note: You can schedule email reminders for specific dates or times, or even for when you arrive at a specific location. Moreover, you can adjust the repeat rate, the priority of the reminder, and edit the note you want to see in the reminder.
* 4) When you’re happy with the settings, click on the Done button to save your reminder.
* Congratulations! You’ve just set an email-based reminder on your Mac and will be reminded at your designated date or time.
* Now that you’ve set an email reminder, you can go about your busy day. When the time comes for you to be reminded of the email, you’ll get a banner notification on your Mac like the one below:

* You can click on the body of the notification banner to launch the email in your Mail app and read or reply to it. If you’ve already taken care of it, then you can answer the notification by clicking on the Complete button to dismiss it and mark it as done, or you can click on the Later button if you feel like procrastinating and dealing with the Reminder a little bit later.
