title: Verizon to end grandfathered unlimited data plans in LTE switch

* Bad news for folks with unlimited data plans on Verizon looking to buy Apple’s new [purported] LTE-flavored iPhone later this year. It appears that the carrier won’t be honoring grandfathered unlimited plans in the switch to LTE.
* Fierce Wireless is reporting that customers on the Big Red network will be forced to choose from a data-share plan when moving from a 3G handset to an LTE one. The news comes straight from Verizon’s CFO Fran Shammo…
* “As these 3G unlimited data plan customers migrate to 4G LTE, they will have to purchase the company’s data-sare plan (which Verizon plans to launch in mid-summer) and move off the $30 per month unlimited data plan. “Everyone will be on data share,” Shammo said.”
* Up until now, the carrier has been allowing customers to keep their grandfathered unlimited data plans when switching from a 3G device to one with LTE. Verizon must be seeing the same negative affects on its network from unlimited data users as AT&T’s Randall Stephenson mentioned earlier this month.
* It’ll certainly be interesting to see how this plays out. Because as it sits, Sprint will be the only iPhone partner in the US offering unlimited data come this fall — LTE or not. This may wind up giving the carrier a much-needed advantage in fighting with the other, much larger carriers, for new iPhone customers.
* What do you think?
