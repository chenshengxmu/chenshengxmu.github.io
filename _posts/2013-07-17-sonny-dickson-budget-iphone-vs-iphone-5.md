* With both big media, Chinese blogs and everyone and their mother in between seemingly betting on the arrival of Apple’s polycarbonate-made mid-range handset later this year, small wonder purported spyshots of the device’s casing have been leaking out from Far East.
* iOS developer Sonny Dickson, who has previously proven himself a reliable source of information about unreleased Apple products, has been on a roll these days tweeting out a number of purported plastic iPhone images. The newest series of authentic-looking images depict several colorized plastic iPhone shells, including one comparing the current iPhone 5 to the purported less-pricey model…
* Check out the following side-by-side shot (an iPhone 5 on the right is AnoStyle’d). From what we could tell, the plastic iPhone probably has the four-inch Retina display because these shells match the iPhone 5’s height and width, though they appear slightly thicker than the iPhone 5.

* If this is a fake, it’s certainly elaborate enough to fool many people.
* For instance, notice the Apple logo and branding on the back and the SIM card tray on the left, along with the volume up and down and mute buttons.
* Of course, there’s no way of telling whether the shots depict the real deal or just some replacement plastic shells a third-party vendor might have produced based on the rumor-mill chatter.
* Dickson previously posted shots of the alleged budget iPhone shells in blue, red, yellow, white and green.
