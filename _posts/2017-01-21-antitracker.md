* Find My Friends is an app made by Apple that lets you track the location of your friends and family so you can find out their whereabouts at any time of the day, but it can also be a real privacy concern.
* While some people enable this feature voluntarily so that their family members can keep tabs on them or so that friends can meet up with one another, others have the feature enabled on them behind their backs so their significant others can stalk them.
* If you’re paranoid about whether or not you’re being tracked, then you need a new free jailbreak tweak called AntiTracker.
* With AntiTracker, you will know whenever you’re being tracked via the Find My Friends app. It shows a notification whenever your device detects that its location is being used for the app, which typically happens in the background when someone pings for your location.
* The notifications appear on both the Lock screen and in banner notifications anywhere else on your device. You’ll see a little Find My Friends icon in the notification, as well as an alert noting that you’re being tracked.
* Because people who want to track you are generally sneaky about it, they may hide the Location Services icon from appearing in your Status Bar or enable location tracking while they’re using your device without telling you. That said, you could be getting tracked right now and not even know it.
* You can, of course, take the precautions to disable location services for Find My Friends, but then if someone goes and changes your settings behind your back, or hides the app deep inside one of your folders that you hardly ever use, then you might never notice because it’s never obvious when someone’s tracking your location.
* AntiTracker will also add a new app icon to your Home screen that lets you configure the tweak to your liking. Here, you’ll find all of the following settings:

* As you can see, this is a pretty nifty little self-defense mechanism against stalkers, and more importantly, it’s free to download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken versions of iOS.
* If you’re afraid that someone might be trying to stalk you, there’s no harm in checking this tweak off. So check it out and let us know what you think in the comments below!
