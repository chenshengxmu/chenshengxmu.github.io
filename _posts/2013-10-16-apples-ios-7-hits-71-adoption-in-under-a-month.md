* Apple’s iOS 7 continues to break records when it comes to how quickly the mobile software is being adopted. In less than a month, nearly 75 percent of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners have upgraded, topping the pace of iOS 6.
* New numbers show in only 27 days 71 percent of iDevice owners had adopted iOS 7 by Monday. By comparison, Apple’s previous version of iOS needed 30 days to reach 61 percent adoption, the Cupertino, California company’s previous record…
* The new Mixpanel numbers suggest that by Monday, iOS 7 was running on 250 million of the 350 million active iDevices, according to Fortune’s Philip Elmer-DeWitt.
* On September 23, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company’s revamped iOS was downloaded more than 200 million times and that the new iPhone 5s/5c saw combined sales of nine million units during the opening weekend.
* Cook also said Apple sold 700 million iOS devices since 2007.

* Today’s figures are just the latest showing the jaw-dropping speed that iOS 7 has been embraced by Apple users. The new software, which introduced both design and function changes, accounted for more than half of web traffic only a week after its release.
* From the start, there’s been an outpouring of interest in iOS 7.
* One the first day, a 112 percent online traffic spike was reported due to people rushing to install iOS 7. Within 16 hours a third of all iOS users had already begun using Apple’s latest mobile software.
* Despite some rough spots, including problems with Messages – even complaints of the gamified and animated user interface causing motion-sickness, iOS 7’s user experience roundly defeated Android and other mobile software.
* Since its release, two minor patches have been released, fixing a Lock screen vulnerability, the iPhone 5s Touch ID problems and other items.
* Have you upgraded yet to iOS 7?
