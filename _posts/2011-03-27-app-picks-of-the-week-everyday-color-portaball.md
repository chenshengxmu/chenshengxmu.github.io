* Color has gotten a lot of attention in the tech sphere over the past week, mainly due to the fact that the project received $41 million (I did say million) in funding. It’s interesting that such an expensive startup is so difficult to explain. The app essentially functions as a photo sharing service that allows you to see and share photos with other people in your vicinity.
* Check out the app’s trailer and see what you can make of it:
* Color is free in the App Store. Even if you don’t like the app, at least it’s got a cool domain name.

* Portaball is a fun little game that uses “portals” to create a series of maze levels. Your goal is to guide the ball through a series of obstructions by creating different portals for the ball to phase through.
* Portaball makes for some great causal gameplay. The app is available for $0.99 in the App Store. There is also a lite version available for free.
* Hope you enjoyed this week’s picks! Feel free to share your opinions on these apps with us. Also, we’d love to hear about any other cool apps you’ve found over the past week. Tell us below!
