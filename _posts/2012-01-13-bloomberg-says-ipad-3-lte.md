* We’ve heard an assortment of rumors over the last month or so regarding Apple’s upcoming tablet release. A majority of them seem to agree that a new iPad will debut sometime between late February and early March of this year.
* As far as features go, however, the gossip has been all over the place. 7″ screen, 10″ screen, Siri, quad-core processor — we’ve heard it all. And now Bloomberg has entered the mix, claiming that Apple’s next tablet will be LTE-capable…
* Bloomberg reports:
* “Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s next iPad, expected to go on sale in March, will sport a high-definition screen, run a faster processor and work with next-generation wireless networks, according to three people familiar with the product.”
* Although the publication cites its source as the ever-murky “people familiar with the product,” it’s worth noting that Bloomberg is considerably more credible than DigiTimes and other rumor-slinging websites.
* There’s also plenty of evidence of Bloomberg’s claims. Last fall, there were numerous reports that Apple was actively testing live LTE-enabled products. And references to quad-core processors were recently spotted in the developer beta of iOS 5.1.
* That being said, we’re still not getting our hopes up on this one. Between the bad taste that the much-rumored but never materialized iPhone 5 left in our mouths, and the lack of LTE coverage available world wide, we’re maintaining our ‘we’ll believe it when we see it’ mentality.
* But hey, it sounds awesome.
