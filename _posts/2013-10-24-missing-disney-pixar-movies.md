* Uh oh. Some users are noticing that Apple has pulled various Disney and Pixar titles from its iTunes Store and iTunes in the Cloud. While the missing movies were initially shrugged off as a glitch, it appears that the move is much more serious.
* It looks like the problem has to do with a licensing agreement between Apple and Disney. And not only does it mean that users can’t buy or rent the titles, but folks who previously purchased them are no longer seeing them in their Purchased tab…
* 9to5Mac shares a comment from a reader:
* “Two movies disappeared from my Apple TV yesterday (Mater’s Tall Tales and The Lion King). I called Apple and they told me that Disney has removed them from the iTunes store. They are no longer available for viewing on my Apple TV. There was no warning, no notice and no refund. According to Apple, all digital content belongs to the content provider.”
* The site refers to the issue as a ‘possible glitch,’ but as noted by AppAdvice, Amazon has pulled the videos from its Instant Video service as well. And the e-commerce giant cites “licensing agreements” as the reason why the movies are now unavailable.
* Perhaps the scariest part of all of this is that it serves as a reminder that movies (or content in general) you’ve purchased from iTunes can disappear from iTunes in the Cloud at any time, leaving you without a way to access them on new devices.
* AppAdvice points to Apple’s disclaimer on this:
* “As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring iTunes Auto-Delivery Content, purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products and TV show iTunes Products (each, “iTunes Eligible Content”), you may download certain of such previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. 
* Some iTunes Eligible Content that you previously purchased may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content, once you download an item of iTunes Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.”
* Neither Apple nor Disney have commented on the matter, but we have to say, we can’t imagine this ordeal lasting very long. Keep in mind that the two companies are very close, with Disney’s Bob Iger on Apple’s board, and Jobs’ history with Pixar Studios.
* Have you noticed Disney/Pixar movies missing from iTunes ‘Purchased’ tab?
