* With Apple’s iPod line receiving a significant upgrade last fall, and declining sales making the music players ever-less important, it wasn’t surprising that there was no mention of them during today’s event.
* But Apple gave them a little love this afternoon, though, as it introduced a new colorway for the iPod touch, nano and shuffle. The devices are now available in the ‘Space Gray’ color, debuted on the iPhone 5S…

* Outside of the new colorway, it doesn’t appear that any other changes have been made to the 3 iPods. Even the prices look the same, with the 2GB shuffle at $49, 16GB nano at $149 and 32GB iPod touch at $299.
* If you’re wanting one, all of the newly-colored devices can be found on Apple’s Online Store, with shipping out to 5-7 days. Of course, they’ll all be available in retail stores alongside the new iPhones on September 20.
