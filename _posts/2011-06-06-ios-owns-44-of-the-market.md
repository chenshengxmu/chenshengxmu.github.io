* Scott Forstall just dropped the numbers on the success of Apple’s iOS. Needless to say, the results are pretty impressive.
* iOS owns 44% of the market, with over 200 million devices registered. If 10% of iOS devices are jailbroken, that means 20 million jailbroken devices! More info after the break!

* Android comes in second with 28% market share. RIM lags behind (big shocker there). Apple’s Mobile Safari also owns 64% of mobile browser usage.

* Besides 200 million devices, Apple also has 225 million accounts registered with one-click purchasing! That’s a lot of cash!
* Apple has also paid develepors $2.5 billion in app revenues. That’s very nice of them.
