* With less than four and a half hours until today’s iPad mini event, the online Apple stores around the world have gone offline as Apple is busy updating the store for us with some interesting new products. As previously noted, we’re expecting some revamped iMacs today alongside the smaller iPad, in addition to perhaps refreshed Mac minis and likely a 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Apple will also provide a live stream of today’s event via a new Apple Events section added to the Apple TV interface, though it’s unclear if the company will also provide a live stream via its home page…
* A week ago Apple sent out invites reading “We’ve got a little more to show you”. Today’s event takes place at San Jose’s California Theatre, a departure from past events that had taken place in San Francisco or at Apple’s Cupertino campus.
* Everything is ready for the big event today.

* It’s unclear whether live stream is only provided as a courtesy to Apple TV owners. Be that as it may, Apple should provide a streaming video a few hours after the press conference wraps up, via its home page.
* When Apple last time did a live stream, the video was also available on iOS devices in real-time via a special link. Now, iDannyOcean speculates on Twitter that this may or may not work to stream today’s live event via devices other than the Apple TV.
* And this should be the direct link to the video on Apple’s Events page.
* The press conference begins at 10am Pacific and iDownloadBlog will provide around the clock coverage to keep you updated with everything related to the announcements.
