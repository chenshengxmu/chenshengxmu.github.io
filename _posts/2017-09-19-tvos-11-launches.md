* Having spent more than three months in beta, the free tvOS 11 software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV and the upcoming Apple TV 4K is now available for public consumption.
* To get the new firmware, head over to our Downloads webpage.
* The tvOS 11 public release has the same build number (15J381) as the tvOS 11 GM.
* Folks who installed the tvOS 11 GM on their Apple TV needn’t do anything because they’ve been running literally the same code as those who have just upgraded to the commercial tvOS 11 release.

* If you’d like to stop receiving the tvOS betas and get commercial versions when they’re released, go to Settings → System → Software Update and turn off Get Public Beta Updates.
* This will let you update to the superseding public release (tvOS 11.x) when it becomes available.
* To install tvOS 11, go to Settings → System → Software Updates and select Check for Update. If an update is available, a message will appear. You can then choose Download and Install to start downloading.
* TUTORIAL: How to update Apple TV software
* If the update does not show up, wait a few minutes or hours because these things take some time to propagate. You can set your Apple TV to automatically download and install software updates by selecting the option Update Automatically in Settings → System → Software Updates.
* tvOS 11 includes minor improvements such as the ability to synchronize your Home screen layout across multiple Apple TVs via iCloud, automatic switching between Light and Dark mode based on local time, new background multitasking modes, notification support, custom sound support, layered image improvements, right-to-left language support and other tidbits.
