title: ClockCenter- An Analog Clock For Notification Center

* When you ride in a luxury car, one of the first things you’ll notice is an analog clock. It’s a sign of grace, style, and precision.
* Since the iPhone is arguably the “luxury car” of smart phones, it’s only right that an analog clock graces iOS 5’s new Notification Center.
* Sure enough, not long after iOS 5 was released to the public, ClockCenter shows up on Cydia…
* While ClockCenter is kind of barren — okay, let’s be honest, it’s extremely barren — it does hold a lot of promise.
* If the developer can line up a good batch of custom themes for ClockCenter, and others jump on the theming bandwagon, then I could see it taking off.
* Until then, the stock theme just isn’t enough to warrant a spot anywhere on my iPhone’s Notification Center, don’t you agree?
* And no, before you ask, I don’t have a luxury car (I wish!); I’ve just ridden in them.
