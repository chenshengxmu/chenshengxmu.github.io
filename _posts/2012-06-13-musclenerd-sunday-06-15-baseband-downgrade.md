* A few days ago we reported about the progress made by Dev Team frontman Musclenerd regarding the possible downgrade of the 06.15 baseband. Looking at the activity on that post we wrote, I’m sure many of you will be happy to learn that Musclenerd hinted earlier today at a release of the downgrade for this Funday Sunday.
* When asked about an ETA of the project, Musclenerd replied:
* I’m aiming for Funday/Sunday for releasing the downgrade from 06.15, but that’s very much subject to possible delay
* As always, this is no guarantee that he will indeed release the downgrade this Sunday, but it sure is promising at this point. This is great news for iPhone 3G/3GS unlockers who’ve been stuck on this buggy baseband for quite some time now.
* We’ll keep you updated!
