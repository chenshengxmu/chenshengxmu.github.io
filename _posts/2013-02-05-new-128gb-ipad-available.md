* As promised, Apple’s new 128GB iPad has become available today. While in-store availability is still unknown, the tablet can be ordered online with an estimated shipping time of 1-3 business days.
* Evidence of the high-capacity iPad was first spotted in the just-released iOS 6.1 firmware last week. And shortly after that, Apple confirmed the slate’s existence and launch date of February 5…
* From Apple’s press release:
* “With more than 120 million iPads sold, it’s clear that customers around the world love their iPads, and everyday they are finding more great reasons to work, learn and play on their iPads rather than their old PCs.
* With twice the storage capacity and an unparalleled selection of over 300,000 native iPad apps, enterprises, educators and artists have even more reasons to use iPad for all their business and personal needs.”
* The new 128GB iPad is available in both black and white, and in either Wi-Fi-only or Wi-Fi + Cellular versions. The Wi-Fi model costs $799 and the + Cellular (LTE for many) model’s a hefty $929.
* Although Apple doesn’t provide specific country availability, the 128GB option has been in every web store we’ve looked at. And all show similar ship times: 1-3 days for Wi-Fi, 3-5 days for +Cellular.
* Apple caught a lot of people off guard with this off-cycle tablet release, especially since there’s nothing new about it outside of its increased storage. A redesigned iPad 5 is expected to land in October.
* So, who’s planning on getting a new 128GB iPad?
* Thanks Leonard!
