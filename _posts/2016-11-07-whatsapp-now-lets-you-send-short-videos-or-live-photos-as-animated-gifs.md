* Following a recent update that added a bunch of new camera features and the ability to draw on photos, Facebook-owned WhatsApp today pushed another update that enables support for animated GIFs. Not only can you now send and receive animated GIFs through WhatsApp for iPhone, but also easily send any short video or Live Photo in your library as an animated GIF. WhatsApp 2.16.15 is required for these features, available free on the App Store.
* Release notes caution that only videos in your Camera roll that are six seconds or shorter can be sent as animated GIFs. Just use the media picker to select a video as your attachment, then tap a new GIF toggle to turn the native video into an animated GIF file.
* To send a Live Photo as an animated GIF file, simply select it from your Photos library and choose Select as GIF. You can also 3D Touch any Live Photo, then swipe up and choose Select as GIF, as shown on the screenshots below.

* To send a Live Photo as a regular photo attachment without the movie part, choose Select as Photo in the shortcuts menu.
* Grab WhatsApp for iPhone at no charge in the App Store.
