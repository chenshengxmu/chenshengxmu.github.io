* Along with new iPhones and Apple Watch Series 3, Apple is widely expected to unveil a fifth-generation Apple TV tomorrow with support for 4K video output and streaming.
* According to findings by developer Steven Stroughton-Smith, who has been sifting through the leaked iOS 11 GM build like there’s no tomorrow, Apple will call its next box “Apple TV 4K”.
* The name signifies that Apple’s marketing department will heavily feature 4K resolution in ads although that’s not the only new hardware improvement that the device is expected to have.
* ROUNDUP: What to expect from Apple’s September product blitz
* Prior leaks have revealed 4K streaming requirements and native @2x resolution (3,840-by-2,160 pixels) of the device. According to code strings unearthed from iOS 11 GM, 4K streaming will apparently require a 15Mbps broadband connection.
* The new box will support many color formats, including Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) to ensure compatibility with a wide range of modern television sets, as well as features like chroma subsampling in 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 for HDR10 and standard YCbCr.
