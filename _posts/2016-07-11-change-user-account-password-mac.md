* It’s a good idea to change your passwords every now and again, and your OS X user accounts are no different. If you’re a Mac admin and you want to make sure everyone gets a fresh and secure password every so often, you should take the steps to change the passwords regularly.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can change an account password on your Mac.
* Passwords can be guessed, and if you’re using the same one for too long, someone might eventually guess it. Moreover, if you use it enough times in front of people, they might get the hang of what you’re typing by watching your keyboard as you type.
* As a general rule of thumb, it’s a good practice to change your password regularly to ensure you always have the highest level of security.
* Most people don’t even bother to change their passwords; they keep the same one forever and ever, but from a security standpoint, this is a big no-no. You’re just giving someone more time to guess it.
* Assuming you’re an admin for your Mac, it’s really easy to change the passwords of user accounts on your Mac.
* To do so, you’ll follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac and then open the Users & Groups preferences pane.

* 6) You are now prompted to enter new details. You can choose a new password, type it again a second time to verify it, and then you can add a hint if you would like.

* 7) Once satisfied, click on the blue Change Password button.
* 8) Click on the Lock button at the bottom right of the window again to save your changes and prevent them from being tampered with.
* That’s all there is to it!
* You’ve changed the password that is now used to log into the user account. You can now try logging into the account with your new password, and if you did it correctly, it should work.
* Understandably, not everyone follows the practice of changing their passwords regularly. At times, it can be quite a pain to remember them all, and it just gets worse if you’re changing them all the time.
* Still, it’s a good habit to get into, and you can use a great app like 1Password to keep track of them all.
* Do you change your OS X account password(s) regularly? Share in the comments!
