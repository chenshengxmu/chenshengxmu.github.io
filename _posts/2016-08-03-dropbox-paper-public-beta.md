* As of today, Dropbox Paper, a collaborative document editor akin to Google Docs and Apple’s iWork for iCloud suite (only better!) is in public beta after spending about a year in private beta, the cloud storage startup announced.
* In addition, the mobile Paper app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch launched today, too, so you can immediately download it at no charge from the App Store.
* “Dropbox Paper helps fast-moving teams work together on docs, find important information, and stay in sync—even while on the go,” said Dropbox. Updates, changes or your feedback automatically sync with your docs on paper.dropbox.com.
* Check out the promotional video for Dropbox Paper.
* As mentioned, the mobile Paper apps for iOS and Android launched today as the service entered public beta. Early Paper users have already created 1+ million documents.
* Based on user feedback, the Paper team has made notable improvements such as enhanced tables and image galleries, notifications across desktop, mobile and web, advanced search features and more.
