title: Meet iSiri, the best iWatch concept to date
---
* The radical iSiri gadget idea by designer Federico Ciccarese may be the ultimate iWatch concept conceived to date. Falling somewhere in between this eerie-looking Matrix-ified gadget and another conceptual time piece with a FaceTime camera on it, iSiri seems so obvious and inevitable. If only Apple didn’t replace the rectangular iPod nano with a tall one…
* Ciccarese has more renderings over at his web site.

* The design whiz explains:
* On the move, in the car, on a walk we want to control our iPhone with the voice and we want it responds without removing it from the pocket.
* He says the answer to this need is iSiri.

* I can’t get Steve Jobs’s joke out of my head.

* During a September 2010 press conference, he put up a slide with a then-new iPod nano with a clock app, saying “one of our board of director members is gonna clip it on to an armband as a watch”.
* I still believe to this date Apple must have an iWatch project somewhere inside Jony Ive’s bunker.
* Apple only needed to add Bluetooth to the previous-generation iPod nano – I’m sure the accessory industry would have taken care of the rest, no?
