* Following HomePod’s arrival today, Apple started educating customers on what it can do with helpful videos through its Tips app and the official HomePod User Guide on the web.
* Available at help.apple.com/homepod, it covers the basics of the HomePod experience, ranging from setting up the device for the first time and adjusting its settings to using Siri for voice-based interactions, playing music, controlling smart home accessories and more.
* Other relevant topics cover things like HomePod privacy and security, Apple’s Podcasts app, controlling music playback, using AirPlay, getting news briefs via Siri and more.
* Written in a clear and concise manner and accompanied by nice animations where it makes sense, this helpful resource should help HomePod owners get the most out of their purchase.
* Have you checked out the HomePod User Guide yet?
* If anything from the document jumped out at you, maybe a little-known feature or an interesting, previously unknown tidbit, do share your findings by leaving your comment below.
