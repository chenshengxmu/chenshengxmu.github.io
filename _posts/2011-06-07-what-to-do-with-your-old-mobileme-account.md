* Mobile is Dead, Long Live iCloud!
* MobileMe is dead and iCloud is the new king of the syncing and online storage lands, but what happens to your old MobileMe account? According to Apple, “if you had an active MobileMe account, your service has been automatically extended through June 30, 2012, at no additional charge. After this, the MobileMe service will no longer be available.”
* What will happen to the content I have on MobileMe? Apple has announced a new service called iCloud which will be available this fall and free for iOS 5 and OS X Lion users. When you sign up for iCloud, you’ll be able to keep your me.com or mac.com email address and move your MobileMe mail, contacts, calendars, and bookmarks to the new service.
* When iCloud becomes available this fall, more details and instructions will be provided on how to make the move.
* So basically, you need to sign up for iCloud and you MobileMe account will be migrated to this new account. You will not lose any data in the process.
