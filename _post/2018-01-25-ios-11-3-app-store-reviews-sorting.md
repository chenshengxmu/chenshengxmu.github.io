* Aside from a bunch of known major new features coming to iPhone and iPad via iOS 11.3 this spring, we’re constantly discovering interesting tidbits that have gone largely unnoticed.
* MacRumors, for instance, discovered Thursday that App Store on iOS 11.3 finally allows sorting of user-submitted reviews. The new sorting options are accessed through a new See All link in the Ratings & Reviews section on App Store.
* You can sort the reviews by Most Helpful, Most Favorable, Most Critical or Most Recent.
* MacRumors explains:
* This is a much appreciated feature addition for those who have developed a recommended habit of checking out reviews of an app as part of making an informed purchasing decision.
* What do you think of the new sorting options for iOS 11.3’s App Store.
