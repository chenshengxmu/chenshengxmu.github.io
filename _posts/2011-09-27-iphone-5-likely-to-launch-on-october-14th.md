* This morning, Apple finally announced the event where the company will unveil the new iPhone 5. The event will be held in Cupertino, on Apple’s campus, on October 4th at 10am. And according to the invite, the company will only announce one iPhone.
* What we’re not sure yet is the launch date of the next iPhone. There have been countless rumors within the last few weeks, but nothing really credible. But this morning, The Next Web got word from a reliable source on the official launch date of the iPhone 5…
* “We have been told by a reliable source that you should expect to be able to line up and purchase your next iPhone on Friday, October 14th.”
* This date works out for several reasons. First, it lines up with the fact that Apple has started denying vacation requests from employees for the 2nd week of October, indicating that the company expects a high influx of customers during that time.
* Then there is France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard who spilled the beans earlier this month by saying that the iPhone 5 would launch in France on October 15th. October 15 is a Saturday, so that’s a no-go. The day before, October 14, makes much more sense. Apple could release the iPhone 5 on a Friday.
* TNW also heard that iOS 5 would be released on the 12th, a couple days before the iPhone 5 actual launch, which would line up with Twitter’s special iOS 5 event.
* As always, you can never be 100% sure until Apple itself makes the announcement, but we decide to trust TNW’s source on this one.
* What do you think?
