title: iOS 5 Now Lets You Create Your Own Shortcuts

* Apple introduced a handy new feature in iOS 5 called “Shortcuts”. If you are familiar with the Mac app called TextExpander (I highly recommend it), or even the awesome jailbreak app called Xpandr, then Shortcuts shouldn’t seem too foreign to you.
* Like the name suggests, Shortcuts allow you to create your own shortcuts. For example, if you’re always typing “Talk to you later” in your emails or text messages, you can create a shortcut for “ttyl”, and every time you type these 4 letters together, it will automatically insert the full “Talk to you later” phrase…
* This has been one of my favorite feature on both my Mac and iPhone, and I’m not lying when I say it saved me hours of typing. This is now part of iOS 5, and by doing so, Apple took a direct stab at the 2 apps mentioned above: TextExpander and Xpandr.
* How do you like this new feature?
