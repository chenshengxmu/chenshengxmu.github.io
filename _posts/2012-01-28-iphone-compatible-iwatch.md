* Digital wrist-wear has come a long way since calculator watches. Now there are products like the I’m Watch and multiple wearable cases that turn the iPod Shuffle into a high-tech ticker.
* But if none of the current offerings are doing it for you, maybe this one will. The iWatch 2 is an iOS-compatible wristwatch that has enough features to make James Bond himself jealous…

* As the name suggests, the iWatch 2 is ADR Studio’s second iteration of the product. If the name sounds familiar, it’s because these are the same guys behind the SJ iPhone concept we showed you earlier this year.
* If its sharp looks don’t impress you, then maybe its feature set will. Not only does the iWatch 2 wirelessly connect to your iPhone or iPad, but it also has a built-in front-facing camera, a mini LCD projector, and a 32GB hard drive to store your media.

* Keep in mind that the iWatch 2 is only in the concept phase, and there’s no word on if it will ever materialize. But we would love to see someone take this idea and turn it into a real product. They just might want to rethink the whole “slide to unlock” thing. We hear Apple owns the rights to that or something.
* If available, would you buy an iWatch 2?
