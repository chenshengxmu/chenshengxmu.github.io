* Heads up gamers, a major new title has landed on iOS this evening. The official mobile port of 2K Game’s Bioshock—thought by some to be one of the best first person shooters of all time—is now available in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for $15.
* For those unfamiliar with the game, it’s set in an underwater Utopia in the midst of a civil war. You play as Jack, a cast-away from an airplane crash who finds himself trapped in this mysterious world filled with powerful technology and fascinating characters.
* Fans of the 2007 hit will be happy to hear that the iOS version stays very true to the original. The graphics have been downgraded slightly to meet performance/file size requirements, but those who have played the port say that gamers can expect a “seamless replay.”
* Mobile Bioshock features all of the major gameplay elements including plasmids—genetic augmentations that empower you with dozens of higher level abilities—and the ability to hack and modify almost anything you see throughout ‘Rapture’ to use as a weapon.
* Here are a few more screenshots:

* 2K warns that BioShock will only run on newer iOS devices, such as the iPad Air, iPad mini 2, 4th-gen iPad, and the iPhone 5S, 5C and 5. It doesn’t say in the app’s description that it supports MFi controllers, but we’ve heard from multiple reviewers that it does.
* Here’s a video showing gameplay:
* If you want to check the game out for yourself, you can find Bioshock in the App Store for $14.99. Granted, that’s far more expensive than the average mobile game, but it does fall inline with most other major mobile ports, and there aren’t any in-app purchases.
