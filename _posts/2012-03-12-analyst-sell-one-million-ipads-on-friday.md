* Apple’s new iPad has already sold out online, after being available for pre-order since March 7th. The new tablet out of Cupertino delivers on Friday, March 16th and will also be available in-stores. With its great specs, Apple has already said demand for the new iPad is “off the charts”.
* People are getting so excited, that analyst Gene Munster says Apple will sell a wholesome one million iPads on Friday…
* Compared to past iPad launch days, Friday should blow them out of the water. On the opening day of the first-generation iPad, Apple sold 300,000 tablets to its customers. At the time, tablets were still new and presumably only die hard Apple fans were going out on a limb to buy the “bigger iPod touch”. As for the iPad 2 launch day, Apple’s supply of the tablet was very constrained. The company only allowed for pre-orders on launch day and never released a number of how many were sold.
* The iPad should do well on Friday for a couple of reasons. New tablet customers might make the leap for their first tablet — the iPad 3 or even the cheaper the iPad 2. The iPad 2 has been marked down in price, making it a good first buy. Also, it’s been two years since the release of the original iPad. For those original owners, it might be time for a spec upgrade.
* So just how good are the specs? The new iPad features a beautiful Retina display, LTE chip, 5 megapixel iSight camera with upgraded sensors, front FaceTime camera, larger battery, and dual-core A5X processor with quad-core graphics.
* Averaging out each iPad sale at $650, if Apple sold 1 million iPads on Friday the company would make $650 million on the first day alone.
* Apple has already sold 55 million iPads to date. Some analysts have even predicted Apple could break through its 100 millionth iPad sold this year.
* Are you picking up an iPad Friday?
