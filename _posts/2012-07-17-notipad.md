* NotiPad is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that promises to provide Growl like notifications on the iPad. The notifications that appear with NotiPad replace the standard banners present in iOS 5 and above.
* Each notification can be tapped to launch its respective app (or double tapped, if you prefer to dismiss it). There are also options contained within the Settings app, that allow you to configure the animation style and switch the position of incoming notifications.
* Take a look inside for the full video walkthrough…
* As you can tell from the video, the notifications very much resemble Growl notifications on the Mac — an interesting departure from iOS’ standard banner system.
* If you’re looking to spice up your iPad’s notifications, then you’re definitely going to want to take a closer look at NotiPad. It has a nice variety of options to configure, (though, considering the asking price of $2.00, I’d like to see more) which allow you to adjust the position and animation of the notifications. You also have options to silence notifications, double tap to dismiss, and launch apps via tapping the notification.
* Unfortunately I was unable to test NotiPad on the new iPad with the Retina display, but I must note that the Growl-inspired notifications appeared to be just a tad blurry on my iPad 2. I also noticed the occasional crash when launching an app via a notification.
* Still, these issues are by no means deal breakers, as the tweak is still in development. Look for it to appear soon on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* What do you think? Would you consider giving NotiPad a shot?
* Update: the developer sent me a message telling me that NotiPad will be available for only $1.00 instead of $2.00.
