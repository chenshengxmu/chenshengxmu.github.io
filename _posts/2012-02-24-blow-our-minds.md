* Apple hosted its annual shareholder’s meeting yesterday in Cupertino, California. This marked the first time that Tim Cook addressed the company’s board and its investors as Apple’s CEO.
* Topics of the meeting ranged anywhere from Apple’s record-breaking quarter last year, to its relationship with Facebook. Those who attended the affair described Cook as witty, knowledgeable, and passionate as he talked about Apple’s future…
* “You can be assured we are working as hard as ever this year to deliver an incredible year and some products that will blow your mind.”
* “Products that will blow your mind.” At first glance, this obviously sounds like a CEO selling his company. But if we take it at face value, the phrase has far more meaning.
* When was the last time Apple unveiled something that blew your mind? I mean really blew your mind. Was it last year, with the iPhone 4S? No. Don’t get me wrong, Siri is cool and all. But it’s not mind-blowing. So the iPad 2 then? No. It was essentially the same thing as the original iPad, but thinner.
* No, the last time that an Apple product really blew our minds (and this is clearly debatable) was the iPad — back in 2010. With its 10″ multitouch display, 10 hour battery life and seemingly endless array of possible uses, the iPad was definitely a game-changer.
* With that in mind, the fact that Tim Cook says that Apple has products coming out this year that will blow our minds has us salivating. Is he talking about the iPad 3? Is the next iPhone really going to be that awesome? Will we finally see the rumored Apple television?
* The world has been waiting to see if Apple can continue to churn out hit products now that Steve Jobs is no longer at the helm. Perhaps this is the year we start finding that out.
