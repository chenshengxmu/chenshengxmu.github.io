* The folks over at HowToarena are reporting that a new SIM interposer for the iPhone 4S is about to hit the market. The GEVEY Ultra S promises to unlock both GSM and CDMA handsets, which is a fairly big deal.
* We’ve already seen a couple of SIM interposers launch for Apple’s latest handset this year. Last month alone we told you about two new products, the R-SIM and TP-SIM. But neither worked with Sprint handsets…
* The new Gevey Ultra S, however, promises to unlock either your Verizon or Sprint-flavored iPhone 4S as long as it meets the following requirements:
* If your iPhone meets all of these qualifications, and you have an extra $60 laying around, then this might be a good solution for those looking to unlock their CDMA iPhones. In fact, if you happen to be a Sprint customer, this might be your only solution.
* The Gevey Ultra S won’t be available until the end of the month, but Applenberry is taking pre-orders. It’s worth noting that these products can sometimes be sketchy, if not illegal, so they are worth researching before purchasing.
