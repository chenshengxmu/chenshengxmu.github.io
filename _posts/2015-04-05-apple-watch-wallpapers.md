* This Friday marks the pre-order date for Apple Watch. You will even be able to walk into a store and try on Apple’s newest device. In what has become one of the most anticipated Apple launches since the original iPhone, we are properly celebrating with Apple Watch wallpapers.
* As described throughout the launch process, utilizing an Apple Watch will require pairing with an iPhone. The first time the Watch is paired with an iPhone, a short animation video on the Watch will confirm the connection. In a recent, lengthy, and very informative Wired article, a must read for any avid fan, a still capture of the confirmation image is portrayed.
* Just beyond the fold, the confirmation image is displayed and our readers were inspired to make wallpapers. Starting with a push from @IanFuchs, we received several variations, which you can download for multiple devices.
* The wallpapers were inspired by the pairing confirmation image found in the Wired article. Immediately below, is the image upon which the following wallpapers took shape.

* Subsequently, is the collection of wallpapers by avid iDB readers. We greatly appreciate the speed and accuracy of your work!
