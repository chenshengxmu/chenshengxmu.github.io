* A new report on how tablet users view their devices and at what times reveals several interesting preferences. Among the most notable discovered by one web application: iPads remain the most-used tablets, particularly in landscape mode at around 10pm during the weekdays. The findings also show tablets other than Apple’s device attracting usage in the single-digits…
* According to OnSwipe (via AppleInsider), which produces an application making web sites more usable by touch devices, the iPad accounts for 94.1 percent of users.
* Amazon’s Kindle Fire has just 4.1 percent of users, with Android tablets just 1.4 percent of OnSwipe’s users.
* In one of those results that tend to confirm your own belief, the company’s report on monthly usage found more than half of tablet owners – 59.8 percent – prefer landscape mode over portrait mode, which registered just 41.2 percent of OnSwipe users.

* The company built on previous research that showed tablets are often used at home and after work. This new report finds 10pm is prime tablet usage time, particularly Monday-Wednesday.
* While iPads are online, they rack up 223 percent more page views than iPhone owners. In terms of online usage, Facebook continues to be a popular destination.

* More than 45 percent of tablets visited the social media giant, while Twitter accounted for 18 percent of visits and Pinterest with twelve percent. Email, however, still reigns supreme: 54.8 percent of sharing is done through mailing, leading second-place Facebook.
