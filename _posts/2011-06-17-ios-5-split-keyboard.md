* If you own an iPad, you know how hard it can be to type on the keyboard with your thumbs like you do on the iPhone. iOS 5 is about to change that with the introduction of a split keyboard option.
* To activate this, simply tap the keyboard icon at the bottom right of the keyboard and it will give you 2 options: undock, which lets you use the keyboard higher or lower on the screen, and split, which let’s you undock and split the keyboard just like it is in the image above…
* From there, you can easily adjust the height of the keyboard by sliding it up and down on your screen.
* I have to admit that it takes a few minutes to adjust to this new feature, but it’s something that most iPad owners will gladly welcome. It makes typing on the iPad faster and easier.
* What do you think of this new feature?
