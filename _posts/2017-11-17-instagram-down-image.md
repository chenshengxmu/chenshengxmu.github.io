* Have you ever wished that Instagram offered a way to save images or videos from your feed directly to your Camera Roll? If yes, then we’re right there with you. Unfortunately, Instagram isn’t likely to add this feature anytime soon.
* Jailbreakers, on the other hand, can get this feature up and running from their Instagram app right now with the help of a new free jailbreak tweak called Instagram Down Image by iOS developer Yutao Lan.
* Installing this tweak puts a new “down” button at the bottom right of every image post in your Instagram feed, as shown above. In case it wasn’t already self-explanatory, this button lets you download the media to your Camera Roll with just a tap.
* You might see an ad after tapping on the button, but it’s easy to dismiss. Upon doing so, you’ll see the “Download Successful” prompt in the middle of your screen, which indicates that you saved the media successfully.
* In our example above, we opted to download the picture of Apple’s Sport Loop Apple Watch wrist strap that Sebastien shared on the iDB Instagram page. That said, we should now see this very same image in our Photos app; et voila:

* Instagram Down Image makes saving images from the Instagram app incredibly simple, and it does so while maintaining a small footprint inside of the Instagram app that won’t get in the way of anything.
* If you want to try Instagram Down Image for yourself, then it’s is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t come with any options to configure and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices with the official Instagram app installed on them.
* For those who don’t have a jailbroken device, you can still save Instagram photos and videos, with this free App Store app.
* Do you find it useful having an easy way to save media from your Instagram feed? Let us know in the comments section below.
