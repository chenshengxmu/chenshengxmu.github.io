* After refreshing Deliveries for iOS with full iOS 10 and watchOS 3 support and other nice-to-haves four days ago, Deliveries for Mac was updated on the Mac App Store with full support for macOS Sierra, Touch Bar shortcuts on the new MacBook Pro and more.
* Touch Bar shortcuts can be customized for features like shipping company suggestions when you add a delivery, auto-complete for email addresses, a 1Password button when it’s appropriate and more.
* Aside from macOS Sierra 10.12 compatibility (El Capitan 10.11 is also supported) and customizable Touch Bar shortcuts, the latest version of Deliveries has rechristened its background component that handles notifications into “Deliveries Express”.
* Thanks to improvements in macOS Sierra, you can Command-drag the Deliveries Express menu bar icon to move or remove. You will also appreciate improved suggestions when adding a delivery, improved tracking number detection for GLS, LaserShip, PostNL and Yamato and enhanced recognition of UPS and PostNL links.

* You can right-click a suggestion on the Add Delivery screen to prevent it from being shown as a suggestion in the future. The app’s Add to Deliveries extension will now automatically fill in item names for “Amazon – by tracking link” deliveries and it now works correctly on images in Mail that link to a tracking page.
* Other under-the-hood tweaks include the following items:
* This Deliveries for Mac update is free for existing users of the app.
* Deliveries for macOS is $4.99 on the Mac App Store.
* Delivers for iPhone and iPad is $4.99 on the App Store.
