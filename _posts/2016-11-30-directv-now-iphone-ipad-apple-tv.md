* Two days ago, U.S. wireless carrier unveiled DirecTV NOW, its brand new Internet television streaming service that comes with a free fourth-generation Apple TV for those who would commit to at least three months of paid service.
* Today, DirectTV apps for the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV have gone live in the App Store.
* From AT&T’s blurb:
* DIRECTV NOW lets you stream top live channels and thousands of On Demand movies and shows instantly upon sign-up. It¹s hassle-free TV, with no commitments, no equipment, and no installers. Watch your favorite shows on your favorite devices.
* Start on one device, pause, and continue watching on another. Missed the first part of your favorite show that started airing 10 minutes ago? No worries! Restart your show from the beginning. Enjoy TV freedom with DIRECTV NOW.
* The service provides several channel bundles, ranging in price from $35 to $70 per month with no commitments, no equipment and no installers.

* With up to 120+ channels available, the service is divided into four different tiers:
* Premium channels like HBO and Cinemax can also be purchased as separate add-ons to any tier for $5 extra each per month per channel.
* A free 7-day trial is available for potential new customers.
* As part of a special promotion, AT&T is offering the Go Big bundle for $35 per month for a limited time. Because this is a streaming-only offering, no cable box is required. Maybe more importantly, no contract or long-term commitment is necessary.
* On a related note, DirecTV is among launch partners for Apple’s new Single Sign-On feature currently available to testers through latest betas of iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1.
* With Single Sign-On, compatible apps can use your saved cable logins to save you from typing your passwords for each app. Other Single Sing-On providers include Dish, Sling TV, Hotwire and GVTC Communications.
* Grab DirecTV NOW free from the App Store.
