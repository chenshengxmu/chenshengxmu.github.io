* Last month, we told you that Chevy started offering Siri Eyes Free in its 2013 Sonic and Spark models, officially making it the first automaker, out of the 9+ that will support it, to incorporate the feature into a production vehicle.
* Today, the car company posted a new TV ad for its 2013 Sonic sedan showcasing the new Siri integration, which gives compatible users hands-free access to the digital assistant from a built-in button on the car’s steering wheel…
* Apple introduced Siri Eyes Free, a feature that allows qualified iPhone users to interact with Siri over Bluetooth using stock vehicle controls, during its WWDC keynote last summer. The feature is available for Siri-enabled iPhones on iOS 6 or higher.
* Using the feature, drivers can use voice commands to perform a number of functions including placing hands-free phone calls, playing songs from the iPod app, and listening to and composing Messages, all while keeping their eyes on the road.
* Other companies that plan to add support for Eyes free include Audi, BMW, Toyota, Honda, Land Rover, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Jaguar. And notably, Apple has been seen talking to Ferrari about further in-car entertainment plans.
* What’d you think of the commercial?
