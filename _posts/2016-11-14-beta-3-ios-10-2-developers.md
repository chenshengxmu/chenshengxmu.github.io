* Apple on Monday seeded the third beta of iOS 10.2 to developers. Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center.
* Today’s release comes just one week after beta 2, which added Apple’s new TV app. In fact, iOS 10.2 features a lot of new stuff including emoji, wallpapers, settings, and improvements related to Emergency SOS.
* Apple has also released third betas of macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1 to developers. These appear to be more maintenance updates, though tvOS 10.1 does add support for Single Sign-on and will likely include new TV app.
* We’ll update this post if any significant changes are discovered in today’s releases. If you see something new we’ve missed, let us know in the comments below!
* Update: here are some of the changes spotted in today’s iOS 10.2 beta thus far:
* SOS feature removed – it looks like Apple has removed the SOS feature in beta 3 that allowed you to call emergency services by pressing the power button.
* Videos app removed – we saw some instances of Apple hiding the Videos app in beta 2, but it appears much more widespread in beta 3, due to the arrival of the TV app.
* New features for TV app – in Settings, as with most streaming apps, you can now choose whether to use cellular data for playback or not and the video quality.
