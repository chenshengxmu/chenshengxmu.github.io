* Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth will be hitting the Mac and Linux platforms this holiday season, with pre-orders now available through GameAgent.com with a fifteen percent discount for GameAgent members and the Exoplanets Map Pack thrown in as a free bonus, developer Firaxis announced Tuesday on the official Civilization website.
* The Mac edition is being handled by Aspyr Media, a Texas-based company which specializes in porting Windows games to the Mac. The Mac and Linux editions of Beyond Earth include all of the features found in the Windows counterpart. The PC edition is set to launch this Friday, October 24.
* All versions of Beyond Earth support cross-platform multiplayer through Steam, Firaxis said. As a bonus, if you buy the game through Steam you’ll enjoy access to each specific platform version through Steamplay.
* The science-fi-themed game, as the title suggests, is set in the distant future in which a series of unfortunate global events have destabilized the world “leading to a collapse of modern society, a new world order and an uncertain future for humanity”.
* Amid the turmoil, the world’s nations embark on deep space travel to chart a new beginning for mankind.
* Check out the launch trailer.
* The player is tasked with leading his or her nation to create a new civilization in space. All of the hallmarks of a Civilization game are present in Beyond Earth. Once again, you’ll be researching new technologies, colonizing other worlds (planets), building Wonders of the World and amassing armies to take on the other nations.
* “As you embark on your journey you must make critical decisions,” reads the blurb. “From your choice of sponsor and the make-up of your colony, to the ultimate path you choose for your civilization, every decision opens up new possibilities”.
* The in-game graphics and the interface look promising.
