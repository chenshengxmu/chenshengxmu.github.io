* Good news future travelers. Alaska Airlines has updated its official iPhone app today to allow its customers to access digital boarding passes using their iPhones. The update, which brings the app to version 2.6, includes support for Passbook.
* Alaska is listed as the 7th largest US airline, by passenger traffic, and it joins several other major airlines in backing Apple’s digital wallet platform. Earlier this month, both Easy Jet and Qantas updated their apps with Passbook support…
* Here’s the full 2.6 change log:
* • Passbook is here! • Add your boarding passes to Passbook • Enhancements to the boarding passes
* With the update, you can now use the Alaska Airlines app to book your flight, check-in, change your seat, and present your digital boarding pass at the gate. Sort of like your one-stop shop for air travel. You can even view first class and standby wait lists.
* At any rate, if you’re going to be going on vacation this summer, and happen to be flying Alaska Airlines, you’ll definitely want to take advantage of the new Passbook support. As usual, you can find the Alaska Airlines app in the App Store, for free.
