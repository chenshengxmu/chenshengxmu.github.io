* Great news this morning for all of you Final Fantasy fans. Following the release of Hitman Go last week, Square Enix has posted a new trailer for its upcoming free-to-play game: ‘Final Fantasy Agito.’ It’s going to be an RPG title, made specifically for smartphones and tablets.
* The game takes place in Orience, a land divided between four nations in a state of near-constant war: the Fiefdom of Rubrum, the Milites Empire, the Lorican Alliance and the Kingdom of Concordia. The main character is a cadet training as Agito, tasked with preventing destruction…
* TouchArcade has more on the gameplay:
* Directed by Hajime Tabata, Agito is a 3D RPG featuring real-time combat and stunning CGI cinematics. Set in the same universe as Final Fantasy Type-0, Agito has a new storyline broken down in chapters that are played out in real time and that change based on the decisions you’ll make. At the end, a new “cycle” will begin and you’ll have more choices to select from. Thus, the game should always be evolving.
* The whole thing sounds interesting, but naturally we have our concerns about free-to-play titles and how their in-app purchases affect gameplay. At any rate, Final Fantasy Agito is slated to launch in May of this year, in Japan. A hard release date hasn’t been given yet for everyone else.
