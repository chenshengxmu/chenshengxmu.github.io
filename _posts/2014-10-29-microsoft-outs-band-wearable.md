* Microsoft has outed its upcoming ‘Band’ wearable in what appears to be the premature release of multiple applications. This evening, ‘Microsoft Health’ landed in iPhone, Android and Windows stores, and a Microsoft Band Sync client popped up in the Mac App Store.
* It’s unknown at this time if the releases were unintentional, or part of a cheeky PR stunt, but it’s likely the former, given the scope of the apps. Microsoft has long been rumored to be working on a cross-platform wearable, and recent reports say it’s preparing for launch.
* The image you see above is of the Band’s desktop syncing client, spotted by Windows Central in the Mac App Store. The screenshot below is of the subsequently discovered Microsoft Health app for iPhone, which seemingly gives away several of the Band’s tracking features.

* Live healthier and be more productive with the Microsoft Health app for iPhone®. Achieve wellness goals by tracking your heart rate, steps, calorie burn, and sleep quality. Maximize your fitness with Guided Workouts, 24-hour heart rate monitoring and automatic activity counting. Be more productive with email previews and calendar alerts at a glance. Personalize your Microsoft Band and get new features as they roll out.
* Among the above-mentioned features, the Band is expected to support smartphone push notifications, including email, text, phone calls, and third-party apps like Twitter. Pundits are also expecting Cortana integration, and Starbucks card support for making purchases.
* The timing of tonight’s app release(s) is interesting, with Apple execs on a press tour to promote its upcoming Apple Watch, and the holiday shopping season just around the corner. Has Microsoft come up with a wearable that will stand out from the others? Stay tuned.
* Want to check the new apps out for yourself? Find Microsoft Band Sync in the Mac App Store here, and Microsoft Health in the App Store here. Both are free.
