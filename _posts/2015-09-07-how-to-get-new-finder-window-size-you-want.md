* Perhaps more than any other macOS feature, the Finder is universally hated by Mac owners for its inconsistencies, bugs, missing features and overly flaky behavior.
* Finder in macOS is plagued with the bafflingly inability to remember window sizes and positions, which is odd considering that past OS X versions allowed a window to be opened exactly how it was left.
* Thankfully, it’s possible to override a window’s default opening behavior on macOS and set it to open to the same size as the last one you created. This tutorial will teach you how to set a Finder window’s default opening behavior.
* Step 1: Open a model window by double-clicking the drive icon on your desktop, or click the Finder icon in the Dock to create a new window.
* Step 2: Set the new window the size you want. Don’t navigate to a different folder as resizing the window must be the first way you interact with it.
* Step 3: Close the window.
* Step 4: Close all open Finder windows, if any, by hitting the Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – W combination on the keyboard. You can also hold down the Option key while clicking each window’s close button or while choosing Close All Windows in the Finder’s File menu.
* Step 5: Now hold down Option while right-click the Finder icon in the Dock to reveal options. Choose Relaunch.

* That’s all there is to it!
* From now on, all subsequent Finder windows will now open in the same dimensions, whether you resized them manually or not. In a typical Apple fashion, new windows offset slightly in location.
* Keep in mind that the aforementioned method does not work in El Capitan betas, indicating the trick might not be an Apple-created workaround solution after all. As such, there are no guarantees it will work in OS X 10.11 El Capitan when it launches to consumers this fall.
* If you though about resizing a Finder window and setting its other attributes before accessing the Finder’s View Options (⌘-J) to choose the Use As Defaults button, think again—that option behaves somewhat erratically as it doesn’t appear to save the window size and proportions.
* Last but not least, you might consider giving dedicated tools like Total Finder a whirl. Among other things, Total Finder opens the same window at the same size every time.
