* Following the advent of iOS 11 earlier today, Apple has now boosted its conservative per-app cellular download limit by fifty percent, going from a hundred to 150 megabytes.
* The company wrote in a note to developers:
* We’ve increased the cellular download limit from 100MB to 150MB, letting customers download more apps from App Store over their cellular network.
* Bumping the per-app ceiling means users can now download larger apps and games using their iPhone’s cellular network. If an app or an app update is up to 150 megabytes in size, you can now download it to your iPhone on the go without bumping into an error message.
* Apps and app updates over 150 MB require that you connect to Wi-Fi.
* The heightened ceiling for cellular downloads is good news for developers who distribute universal binaries which hold Retina assets designed for multiple form-factor devices, especially as the upcoming iPhone X has introduced yet another screen resolution.
* The last time Apple increased the App Store cellular limit was four years ago, going from 50MB to a hundred megabytes following the release of iOS 7. When the App Store debuted in the summer of 2008, it imposed a measly 10MB per-app limit on cellular downloads.
