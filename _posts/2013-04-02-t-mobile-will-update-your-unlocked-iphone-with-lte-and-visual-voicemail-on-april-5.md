* This is quite noteworthy. Following a jailbreak hack which purports to make your unlocked AT&T iPhone 5 (model A1428) work on T-Mobile’s LTE by way of loading a custom carrier firmware, a new report claims the Deutsche Telekom-owned wireless carrier itself will be sending out a carrier update designed to officially enable T-Mobile’s LTE and Visual Voicemail, among other features, on unlocked GSM devices.
* The update is scheduled for delivery beginning April 5, a week ahead of T-Mobile’s official April 12 roll-out of its LTE-ready iPhone 5. The patch is good news for AT&T customers looking to jump ship as they won’t be required to buy a newly tweaked iPhone 5 model from T-Mobile in order to enjoy T-Mobile’s 4G LTE speeds. There’s more to know so go past the fold for full details…
* TmoNews notes that this is an Apple update so it should hit iTunes or all iPhone devices around the same time. The publication also posted a credible-looking photo of an internal T-Mobile document, seen above.
* The doc reads:
* The T-Mobile Carrier Update is a minor iOS software update that enables official iPhone support by T-Mobile.
* When installed, the software update enables a handful of capabilities like Visual Voicemail, MMS Settings and Network/Device optimizations that customers do not have access to today.
* On April 5, the software update will begin being pushed via OTA to all iPhone devices on the T-Mobile network with iOS 6.1.x or higher.
* Again, come April 5 you should be able to take your unlocked AT&T iPhone 5, apply the patch and immediately start enjoying T-Mobile’s LTE. On the other hand, you will not be able to run a patched device on T-Mobile’s AWS Band 4 frequencies used for its 3G network because iPhone devices sold to date lack hardware support for AWS Band 4.
* In other words, the AT&T iPhone 5 variant patched with Apple’s carrier update will fully support T-Mobile’s LTE, but won’t be able to fall back to the carrier’s 3G network outside of LTE coverage. Instead, these devices will revert to the sluggish T-Mobile EDGE network on Band 2.
* This is precisely why Apple had to create a factory tweaked iPhone 5 version for T-Mobile. Despite carrying the same model number A1428 as the existing AT&T iPhone 5, the tweaked variant features a slightly re-jigged hardware for full compatibility with T-Mobile’s 4G LTE and 3G DC-HSDPA network.
* Apple previously confirmed to Engadget it couldn’t just roll out a software update to the existing A1428 devices as the necessary firmware tweak has to be applied at the factory.
* “Apple affirmed to us that it’s not something that can be enabled via a simple software update for A1428 iPhone units already in circulation,” Engadget claimed last week.
* Apple also promised to phase out the existing AT&T A1428 iPhone 5 variant in favor of the factory tweaked A1428 model. Not only is it compatible with both T-Mobile’s 4G LTE and 3G DC-HSDPA, it actually supports all AT&T and T-Mobile frequencies.
* Last week, AT&T confirmed plans to roll out HD Voice on its network “later this year.” HD Voice, or Wideband Audio, is a network feature T-Mobile will support first among major U.S. telcos when its iPhone 5 launches on April 12.
