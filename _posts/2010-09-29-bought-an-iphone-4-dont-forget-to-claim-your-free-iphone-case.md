* If you bought an iPhone 4 between its launch date and September 30th, you are entitled to receiving a free iPhone case from Apple. The company had decided to give away case to iPhone 4 owners after complaints started erupting about the iPhone 4 antenna issue.
* Last month though, Apple released a statement and confirmed that the “iPhone 4 Case program” would end on September 30th. So if you bought an iPhone 4 and haven’t claimed your free case, then hurry up. Here is what you need to do…
* Step 1: Download the iPhone Case Program app from the App Store.
* Step 2: Launch the app and login with your iTunes credentials.
* Step 3: Select the case of your choice.
* Step 4: Wait 3-4 weeks to receive your case.
* Have you claimed your free iPhone 4 case yet? If so, have you received it? Satisfied?
