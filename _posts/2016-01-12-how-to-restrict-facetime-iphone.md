* If you want to temporarily disable FaceTime on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad without signing out in Settings → FaceTime and having to manually log back in with your Apple ID to re-enable it, you’ve come to the right place.
* This tutorial will show you how to temporarily disable FaceTime on your iOS device and teach you to quickly re-enable it, without having to jump through hoops.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Tap General → Restrictions and enter your Restrictions passcode.
* Tip: If Restrictions are disabled on your device, tap Enable Restrictions at the top and choose a 4-digit passcode that you’ll need to enter before changing these settings.

* This will have literally the same effect as disabling the service in Settings → FaceTime, with three additional benefits:
* Of course, incoming FaceTime calls sent to your mobile phone number or Apple ID will still reach your other devices but will no longer ring on this iPhone. FaceTime-enabled contacts within iOS’s Contacts and Phone apps and surfaced in Spotlight Search will no longer show dedicated FaceTime Video and FaceTime Audio buttons.

* To re-enable FaceTime without having to log back in, just set the FaceTime toggle in the Restrictions section to the ON position. This will re-enable the app on your device instantly, without needing to re-type your Apple ID password.
* The Home screen icon will be reinstated and FaceTime access through Spotlight Search, Contacts and Phone apps re-enabled.
* How do you like this tip?
