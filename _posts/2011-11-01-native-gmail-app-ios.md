* If you’re an iPhone owner and also happen to be a Gmail user, you may want to pay attention. Word on the street is that Google is putting the finishing touches on a native Gmail application for the iOS platform.
* MG Siegler, an Apple columnist for TechCrunch, made the announcement last night. The tech writer has learned that Google is nearly finished with an iOS-flavored native Gmail app, and it’s headed for the App Store…
* “Google is on the verge of launching their native Gmail app, multiple sources tell me. In fact, I believe it has already been submitted to Apple for review. If it gets approved, it should be out soon. And I think it’s going to be approved. This is great news for a couple of reasons. First: native Gmail app! Awesome. Second: those who have seen the app tell me it’s pretty fantastic.”
* Of course, you can already access Gmail in iOS via Safari. You can also setup a Gmail account through the Mail application. You can even get your emails pushed to you via this neat Exchange hack. So why would you need a native Gmail app?
* From the sounds of it, the app will be for folks who utilize Gmail’s additional features, such as one-click email flagging and Priority Inbox. Of course, all of this is pending the application’s approval. We’ll keep you updated on the app’s status.
* Would you use a native Gmail app?
