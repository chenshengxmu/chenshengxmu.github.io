* Just a couple of days ago, iOS developer LaughingQuoll released the first piece of the Eleven jailbreak tweak suite, which brings many of iOS 11’s features to jailbroken iOS 10 devices without needing to upgrade the firmware. Dubbed LockscreenXI, it mimicked the iOS 11 Lock screen interface.
* If you found that release exciting, then you’ll be happy to know another piece of Eleven is now available in Cydia. ControlCenterXI is now available and brings iOS 11’s modular Control Center interface to jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Once installed, you will notice the new cosmetics immediately, but the tweak also offers a the functional aspect you would expect from Control Center on iOS 11. By using a 3D Touch or a tap and hold gesture, you can access the individual modules.
* Doing so brings up full-screen widgets dedicated to controlling music playback, accessing all your toggles, adjusting screen brightness, and fidgeting with Night Shift mode, and more:

* ControlCenterXI adds a new cell to the Eleven preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure a few options:

* Here, you can:
* All changes to the preferences require a respring to take effect. Fortunately, a respring button is available for your convenience.
* Anyone who’s seen the iOS 11 betas would agree that ControlCenterXI provides a convincing replica for jailbroken iOS 10 devices, but it doesn’t stop there because the tweak also works with popular Control Center jailbreak tweaks like FlipControlCenter and Noctis.
* If you’re interested in trying ControlCenterXI for yourself, you can download it for $1.50 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* Are you a fan of the way Control Center has been redesigned in iOS 11? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
