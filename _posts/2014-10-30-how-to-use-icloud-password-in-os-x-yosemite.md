* New in OS X Yosemite is the ability to use your iCloud Password to log in to OS X and unlock your screen. It’s a convenient way to lessen the amount of passwords that you need to use and manage.
* With that in mind, you’ll need to be logged in with your iCloud account to enable iCloud Password. Check out our video walkthrough after the jump to see how to do just that.
* Yosemite will prompt you on first setup to enable iCloud Password once you log in with your iCloud account. If you decline during this initial setup, Yosemite will allow you to enable iCloud Password later. This can be done by going to System Preferences → Users & Groups → Change Password, and clicking the Use iCloud Password button.
* What do you think about using iCloud Password instead of a normal password on your Mac? Would you consider enabling this new feature due to its convenience factor, or would you prefer to keep the two entities separate?
