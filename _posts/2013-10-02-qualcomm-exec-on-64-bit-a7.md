* In a recent interview with Techworld, Qualcomm’s chief marketing officer Anand Chandrasekher told the publication that he thinks that Apple’s 64-bit A7 processor is just a ‘marketing gimmick’ and that it adds ‘zero benefit’ for the customer.
* The executive’s remarks follow several weeks of discussion on the processor, which is the first 64-bit chip to land in a smartphone, from all corners of the tech world. Here’s why he thinks it’s more of a marketing stunt than a technical enhancement…
* From Techworld’s report (via MacRumors):
* “I know there’s a lot of noise because Apple did [64-bit] on their A7,” said Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Qualcomm, in an interview. “I think they are doing a marketing gimmick. There’s zero benefit a consumer gets from that.”
* A benefit of 64-bit is more memory addressability, but that is not relevant in today’s smartphones or tablets, Chandrasekher said. The iPhone 5s has only 1GB of DRAM.
* “Predominantly… you need it for memory addressability beyond 4GB. That’s it. You don’t really need it for performance, and the kinds of applications that 64-bit get used in mostly are large, server-class applications,” said Chandrasekher, who previously ran Intel’s mobile platforms group.”
* While there’s a lot of folks that agree with Chandrasekher, there’s also many who don’t. For example, in the latest DJay update, Algoriddim claims the A7 chip in the iPhone 5s allows for 2-4 times faster processing for some production tasks.

* And then there’s developer Mike Ash, who recently did some serious digging into the A7. He calls it a ‘welcome addition,’ saying that the chip does make for faster computations in some cases, and makes certain programming techniques more viable.
* But the overall consensus on the A7, from both the praisers and the neigh-sayers, seems to be that the 64-bit chip doesn’t mean as much now as it will in a few years. So marketing gimmick or not, it’s nice to see Apple leading the way in this arena.
* What do you think?
