* Snap Inc’s newest Spectacles camera sunglasses are made for the summer.
* That’s how the company pitches its latest camera-equipped sunglasses.
* Snap said Thursday that the new Spectacles feature water resistance—and that’s a nice upgrade over the original because it will permit customers to wear their new Spectacles at pool parties and on rainy days, capture photographs or record video in shallow water and more.
* “We want Spectacles to be the simplest and easiest way to make memories from your point of view, and we appreciate all of your thoughtful feedback—many of these improvements were inspired by you,” Snap said.
* In addition to water resistance and being more comfortable to wear courtesy of a smaller profile, the second-generation Spectacles also feature enhanced audio, 30-second video recording, the ability to take pictures and more.
* Controls are simple: press the button on the left side of the frames to record a 10-second video, press it again to keep recording up to 30 seconds or press and hold to take a photo.

* Internal storage holds up to 3,000 images or 150 videos.
* You can capture up to 70 videos on a single charge and these new Spectacles recharge up to four times in the included charging case. Transferring captured media to the mobile app is now up to four times faster, the company said. The app requires an iPhone 5 or later running iOS 10 or above or an Android phone running Android 4.4 or above.
* The device comes outfitted with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy networking. The newest Spectacles are labeled model “002,” according to a recent FCC filing.
* The $149.99 connected sunglasses are available to order in Sapphire, Onyx or Ruby starting today in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and France $149.99.
