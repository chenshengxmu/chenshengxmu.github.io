* Apple’s iPhone 8 should feature a whole new industrial design with an almost full-screen face, a 2.5D curved OLED screen, no physical Home button, an in-screen fingerprint reader and other perks. Earlier this week, leakster Benjamin Geskin posted what files as the first hands-on video featuring a CNC-machined iPhone 8 dummy model.
* Don’t read too much into this report— this is a dummy iPhone 8 unit after all, and as such for display only. It’s not a real working phone nor is it one of the iPhone 8 prototypes.
* And here it is.
* Don’t let the lack of an Apple logo on the backside confuse you: this is, as I’ve said, a mockup that matches up with a bunch of the rumors we’ve heard thus far.
* That said, the clip provides a good approximation of what a future iPhone with a nearly full-screen front face might look like. Be sure to check out another iPhone mockup that leaked last week, which could be representative of the final design Apple settled on.

* Apple is said to have tested about ten different iPhone prototypes.
* Some of them probably sport a rear Touch ID, just in case Apple’s plan to integrate a next-generation fingerprint sensor into the display assembly falls apart. To give you a better idea what an iPhone with a rear Touch ID might look like, do check out the images of an iPhone 8 clone from China, some of which you can see above.
* Apple is likely to unveil its 2017 iPhone lineup at a media event in September.
* Aside from a new premium design and a full-front OLED display, iPhone 8 is widely expected to feature wireless charging, 3D facial scanning, a ten-nanometer A11 chip designed by Apple, augmented reality features and, of course, iOS 11 that Apple will preview at WWDC next month.
