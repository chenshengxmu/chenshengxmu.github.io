* Apple on Thursday shared a new video on its YouTube channel called “Timer – Behind the Scenes.” As the name suggests, the clip offers a humorous behind-the-scenes look at the making of the iPhone 6s ad it released last month, starring the popular Sesame Street character Cookie Monster.
* The original Cookie Monster iPhone 6s ad is one of Apple’s most popular commercials in recent memory, with the YouTube version receiving nearly 9 million hits. In it, Cookie Monster enlists the help of Siri to set a timer and play a Music playlist as he waits for his cookies to finish baking.
