* Attention Path users: the personal social network has just released a new version of its iOS app. The update brings the application to version 3.0.4, and includes enhanced privacy features, as well as other improvements and bug fixes.
* The fact that it includes new privacy tools is particularly interesting, given that Path spent most of this past week dealing with privacy concerns after a user accused its app of ‘erroneously’ sending text messages to all of his contacts…
* And here’s your full 3.0.4 change log:
* – Enhanced Privacy: Want to go even more private on Path? Now you can hide yourself in global search in Settings. – Typing Indicator: Wondering if your friend is typing a message to you? Now you will know if they are typing and where they are typing from. – Unread Messages: Never miss a message. Improved unread message badging and notifications. – Group Message Names: Now you can personalize a Group Message by simply tapping on the name. – Search Bookmarks: Love searching for the same moments all the time? Now you can bookmark your favorite searches. – Friend Finding & Inviting: Want more of your friends and family on Path? Improved tools to find your friends and family on Path or invite your friends and family to Path. Now with Twitter and Gmail. – New User Experience: Improved new user experience. – Speed: All kinds of speed and performance improvements all around the app.  – Bug Fixes
* Path’s stance on this week’s debacle has been that the app’s automated text messages are meant to simplify the friend-finding process. It says “the app is really best with friends,” and users who don’t like the feature can disable it.
* The new privacy feature doesn’t change any of that, but it does allow users to now hide their Path pages from global searches. Also new in today’s update is the ability to bookmark your favorite searches and message response indicators.
* I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, the Path app is absolutely a joy to use. It’s just too bad I don’t know anyone who uses it. Though, it did just pass the 10 million user mark. So apparently there are a lot of folks who do.
* If you’d like to check out the new Path, you can find it in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
