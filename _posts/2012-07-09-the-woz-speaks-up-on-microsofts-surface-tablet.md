* The outspoken Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak usually has an opinion on many things, be it Siri and her reliance on a network connection, Facebook IPO (he said he’d invest regardless of opening price), patent war fallout, the iPhone 4S battery life and Android march and what not.
* His latest comment from a a press conference at Entel Summit in Chile last week concerns Microsoft’s Surface tablet, unveiled with much fanfare on June 18…
* The Woz, everyone’s ultimate geek known for using both Apple’s devices and Android smartphones, supports Microsoft’s plan to enter the tablet race with its own branded slate. It’s a heartwarming indication of a new Microsoft, he opined at a presser:
* I’m glad that Microsoft is starting to show maybe they’re a different company than before, I don’t remember this sort of thing happening in a long, long time with Microsoft, so I’m very happy.
* And on Steve Jobs coming back reincarnated at Microsoft:
* Microsoft’s latest products have such a strikingly good visual appearance which is a lot of what Steve Jobs always looked for, the art and technology; the convergence of art and technology. And usually It was visual appearance of things. So I made a joke that Steve Jobs came back reincarnated at Microsoft.
* Here’s that clip, it runs four minutes and 33 seconds long.
* Being a hard-core engineer, of course Wozniak is eager to try out the Surface once it comes out later this year.
* I do want to see the Surface. I want to own one, I want use one but I prefer to judge things I really know and not just what I’ve read about.
* The video also has Woz talk about Megaupload’s Kim Dotcom and Google’s Minority Report-style Glass project.
* I don’t know about you, but I’m kinda also interested to get my hands on an ARM-powered version of the Surface.
* What about you?
