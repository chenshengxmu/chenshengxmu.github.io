* Nest Labs, which Google is acquiring for $3.2 billion in cash, has resumed sales of its Nest Protect after recalling about 40,000 units in April over a safety bug with the smoke and carbon monoxide detector’s Protect Wave feature potentially preventing the alarm from sounding.
* The company has now disabled Protect Wave on existing devices via a software update while re-releasing a slightly tweaked device at a discounted price of $99 each, down from the previous price of $129…
* “We’re very pleased that Nest Protect is once again available to customers,” said Nest. “And now, the price is $99 to make it accessible to as many people as possible.”
* As noted by Nest, the company has amassed valuable real-life data via the “hundreds of thousands of Nest Protects already installed and connected to the Internet”, allowing it to analyze actual CO events on a scale that’s never been done before.
* “CO poisoning kills over 400 people a year in the U.S. alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the blog post notes. “We’re dedicated to seeing that number decline.”
* The intelligent smoke detector debuted last October.

* To go with the freshly re-released Nest Protect, the company has given its companion Nest Mobile for iOS app a little love in the form of much-needed tweaks, such as a more reliable Nest Protect account pairing and the removal of the problematic Nest Wave setting.

* As a result of these changes, Nest Protect owners now must reach for a hardware button on the device in order to silence the alarm. It’s a band-aid solution as a Nest spokesperson told Engadget that the firm is working on “an easier way to silence the alarm”.
* Previously, Nest Protect units employed hand gestures. But as some people would inadvertently silence the device when they didn’t mean to, the feature posed a safety risk so the product was recalled.
* By the way, if you bought a Nest Protect before June 15 that has been paired to your Nest Account and connected to the Internet after April 3, 2014, you can request a credit here, provided you haven’t been previously submitted for a credit or a full refund.
* Would you buy a Nest Protect now that it’s $30 cheaper?
