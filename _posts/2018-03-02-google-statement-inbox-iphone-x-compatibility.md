* In the past three moths, Google has added iPhone X support to its most important iOS apps.
* With one notable exception…
* The Inbox by Gmail app has remained ignored to this date, still showing black bars at the top and bottom of the interface when launched on an iPhone X—a tell-tale sign that an app hasn’t been optimized to take full advantage of the native iPhone X display resolution.
* Luckily, the search giant is indeed working on an iPhone X compatibility update to the Inbox app, as confirmed in Google’s forums by Vanessa, the company’s Community Manager.
* Here’s her statement in full, attributed to the Inbox team (via Piunika):
* Hi everyone!
* Thanks for your feedback. The Inbox team is aware and taking the necessary steps to provide an update to optimize for iPhoneX. Thanks for hanging in there with us!
* I wish they’d push out that iPhone X update as soon as possible because Google’s attitude towards Inbox users is beyond inexcusable.  I’m a heavy user of Readdle’s Spark email app, but I’m also liking Google’s Inbox software and have been using it every now and then.
* Since switching to my iPhone X, I can no longer bring myself to using Inbox on a regular basis due to those ugly black bars reducing the app’s usable screen real estate.
* Apple recently cautioned its registered developers that it will stop accepting new iOS apps that don’t include support for the Super Retina display of iPhone X beginning next month.
* Hopefully, that will incentivize developers to double-down on iPhone X compatibility because it’s high time all those hopelessly outdated or rarely updated apps get purged from App Store.
* Thoughts?
