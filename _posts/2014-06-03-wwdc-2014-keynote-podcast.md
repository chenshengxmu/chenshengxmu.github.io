* Shortly after wrapping up Monday’s two-hour keynote talk, Apple made the entire presentation available for streaming through its WWDC iOS app, via the Apple TV and on its website on any Mac or Windows PC with QuickTime installed.
* If you want to keep the keynote video, plan on watching it on multiple devices or just have a lousy Internet connection to stream in high-definition, you can now download the entire presentation to your computer for later watching…
* The keynote runs two hours and ten minutes long.
* Apple has made the video file available to download through its Apple Events podcast channels in iTunes, in three resolutions.
* Here are the links:
* • WWDC 2014 keynote in SD [508.5MB] • WWDC 2014 keynote in 1080p [3.54GB] • WWDC 2014 keynote in HD [6.21GB]
* “See Apple CEO Tim Cook and team unveil OS X Yosemite, iOS 8 with iCloud Photo Library, new Messages features, the new Health app, and more,” reads the description.
* These podcasts offer video of Apple’s most important announcements, including presentations by former CEO Steve Jobs and current boss Tim Cook.
* To have iTunes download future keynotes the instant they become available, simply subscribe to Apple Keynotes, Apple Keynotes (HD) or Apple Keynotes (1080p) and turn on the automatic download option in your podcast settings.
* We’ll let you know as soon as the keynote pops up on Apple’s YouTube channel.
