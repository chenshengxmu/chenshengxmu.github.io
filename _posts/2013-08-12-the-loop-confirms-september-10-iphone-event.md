* Boom, just like that an independent and unambiguous confirmation of Apple’s rumored iPhone-focused media event, apparently due in less than a month, has now arrived.
* You’ll remember that two days ago AllThingsD was first to claim that Tim Cook & Co. will take the wraps off of a next-generation iPhone at a media event on September 10.
* AllThingsD is a Wall Street Journal blog which rarely publishes unconfirmed rumors, but despite its aura of credibility it’s always nice receiving an independent confirmation of a major rumor like this. Monday, The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple has thrown its proverbial ‘yep’ behind the AllThingsD rumor, all but confirming the September 10 event…
* The Oracle (pictured top of post next to Slash) has spoken:
* From AllThingsD:
* Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone at a special event on Sept. 10
* Yep
* Jim has excellent sources that are seemingly deeply entrenched in Apple’s PR so when he yeps or nopes a rumor, you can bet he’s not pulling it out of thin air. Some watchers consider him to be Apple’s unofficial mouthpiece so there’s little wiggle room for misinterpretation here.
* In the meantime, Apple hasn’t commented on the event yet, which is the company’s standard modus operandi that has served it well over the years as it helps build tremendous anticipation for free.
* We’re expecting multiple iPhone announcements, including the mid-cycle S-upgrade: the iPhone 5S with beefed up specs like a faster A7 chip, a fingerprint sensor and a 12-megapixel camera with dual-LED flash for improved night shooting and super slow motion video capture at 120 frames per seconds.
* There is also compelling evidence pointing to a mid-tier iPhone announcement, ostensibly branded the iPhone 5C, with the ‘C’ apparently standing for ‘color’.
* The iDB team will of course be covering Apple’s announcement as it happens, bringing you the latest and most important news as it happens – kinda like CNN, but without a commercial break every fifteen minutes.
* Who’s already excited?
