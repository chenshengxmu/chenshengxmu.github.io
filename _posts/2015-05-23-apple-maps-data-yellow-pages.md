* Apple on Friday updated the Acknowledgements page for its mapping software, adding a handful of new data partners. The page gives credit to TomTom, Yelp and other companies that provide Apple Maps with imagery and information.
* Among the new partnerships added this week are E-WEGO, a business listing firm, navigational ad expert NavAds, and Yellow Pages. TripAdvisor and Booking.com are also now listed as official partners, following a report earlier this year.
* Apple has been vigorously working on its Maps app since it launched in 2012 to much disparagement. Users have criticized the software for being inaccurate, and lacking many of the features of competitor map apps, such as transit info.
* A lot of the inaccuracies, however, have been corrected in recent years and rumor has it that Apple is working on some of those missing features. It’s believed that iOS 9, debuting at WWDC, will feature a Maps app with public transit details.
