* The Electra Team’s new jailbreak tool for iOS 11.2-11.3.1 devices received a couple of minor updates over the weekend to address a few issues that were present in the initial release.
* Full details concerning the most recent updates to Electra1131 are listed on the tool’s official web page, and will also be outlined for your convenience below:
* Version 1.0.1:
* Version 1.0.2:
* As it would seem, these updates only squash a few bugs that may have impacted a small number of jailbreakers initially. They don’t appear to increase the jailbreak tool’s success rate for those that haven’t already jailbroken their device(s) with Electra1131, which was a major pain point for some users that attempted the jailbreak a multitude of times on release day.
* As always, we recommend downloading and using the latest version of the Electra1131 jailbreak tool on your device for stability reasons. We made a full tutorial about using Electra1131 that may be of use to you if you have never jailbroken a device with Electra before.
* It is safe to use a newer version of Electra1131 over your existing jailbreak on iOS 11.2-11.3.1 via Cydia Impactor as long as you downloaded it from the official Electra website. Do not trust jailbreak tools that claim to be Electra1131 and that have been downloaded from third-party websites, as these may be harmful to your device or privacy.
