* Angry Birds is coming to the silver screen next summer and now Sony Pictures and Rovio have published the first full-length teaser trailer for The Angry Birds Movie, the official 3D animated movie based on the famous bird-flinging franchise.
* Starring Jason Sudeikis as Red, Josh Gad as Chuck, Danny McBride as Bomb and Bill Hader as the villainous pig Leonard, the movie promises to reveal why the famous birds are so angry in the first place.
* First, the official synopsis:
* The movie takes us to an island populated entirely by happy, flightless birds – or almost entirely.
* In this paradise, Red (Jason Sudeikis, We’re the Millers, Horrible Bosses), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad in his first animated role since Frozen), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride, This is the End, Eastbound and Down) have always been outsiders.
* But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies, it’s up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to.
* And now the trailer.
* The full cast is as follows:
