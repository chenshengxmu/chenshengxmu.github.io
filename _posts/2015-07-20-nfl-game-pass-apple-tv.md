* For the first time ever, the National Football League (NFL) will offer its Game Pass service to U.S. users on the Apple TV with on-demand broadcasting of games, according to an update on the Game Pass micro-site Monday.
* Regular season, playoff and Super Bowl game broadcasts won’t be available as live streams but rather after they air on television. In addition, the organization will retire its existing Game Rewind service on July 31. Available to iOS, Android and Windows users in the United States, Game Rewind provides access to on-demand games after they air on television.
* “As of July 31, 2015 Game Rewind will no longer be available” and will be replaced with “the all new NFL Game Pass” service that will be available on the Apple TV, according to the website.
* The upcoming service will offer live streams of 65 pre-season and all 256 regular season games, in addition to 10 playoff games and Super Bowl 50 games after they air on TV.
* Access to 2009-2014 archived footage will be provided, too.
* The new Game Pass service shouldn’t be confused with the existing Game Pass service which has been available to international sports fans for quite some time now.
* The new Game Pass will be available on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad as an update to the NFL’s existing mobile app and will debut on the $69 Apple TV and “select connected TV devices” including Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Xbox One console.
* This is no doubt a major development, especially if you’re a sports fan, as NFL has never allowed full game broadcasts on Apple’s box outside the existing NFL Now channel which offers only game highlights, news and select archived videos.
* Pricing for Game Pass is yet to be revealed.
* For what it’s worth, the existing Game Pass offers a 7-day free trial and two paid tiers: an all-you-can-eat Season Plus access with every Preseason and Regular Season game and replays of 2015 playoff games and Super Bowl 50 in exchange for $129.99 per year (or four payments at $39.99 per month) and a lower-priced Season $99.99 package with just Preseason and Regular Season games.
