* Good news for all of you folks hoping to soak up some last minute rumors before tomorrow’s event. We’ve come across some new details regarding Apple’s expected announcements.
* First off, among the many changes Apple is figured to introduce in the new iPhone, is a new, smaller 9-pin dock connector. And apparently, that connector has a name: Lightning…
* 9to5Mac just posted a couple of interesting tidbits it has learned about the new dock connector, new headphones, and new iPod touch accessories ahead of tomorrow’s big iPhone event.
* “According to our sources, Apple’s new, smaller 9-pin dock connector is dubbed “Lightning” internally. As of this evening, we believe that this name will extend to the new connector’s marketing name.”
* As the site points out, the name makes sense, especially if the new cable syncs data faster than its predecessor (possibly USB 3.0?). And it will also go nicely with Apple’s Thunderbolt port.

* In addition, 9t05Mac’s sources confirmed that Apple will be unveiling new headphones tomorrow, in line with recent rumors. They’ll be called Earpods, apparently, and feature an improved design and acoustics, and retail for the same price as the current set, $30.
* Finally, the site is wagering we’ll see a new ‘Loop’ iPod touch accessory tomorrow. Reportedly, it’s unique, will come in several different colors, and should retail for around $10. Interesting.
* Of course, nothing is official until it hits the stage tomorrow. So be sure to tune in to iDB for full event coverage and commentary. And in the mean time, read our iPhone 5 rumor roundup.
* So, what do you think of Lightning?
