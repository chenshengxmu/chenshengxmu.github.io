* Interested in having a waxing crescent in your status bar instead of the standard Do Not Disturb moon icon? A new jailbreak package will allow you to theme the DND icon with the current moon phase.
* The package, entitled Do Not Phase, piggybacks on the popular Protean jailbreak tweak in order to accomplish its goal. The result is a slick-looking Do Not Disturb moon icon that clues you in on the day’s current moon phase.
* To install Do Not Phase, simply add the following repo to your Cydia sources:
* http://apt.fritztech.net/
* Once added, find and install Do Not Phase. The tweak has several package prerequisites, so you may notice that it will install additional Cydia releases, such as Protean, upon installation.
* Once Do Not Phase is installed, invoke Do Not Disturb.
* Next, venture over to Protean’s preference panel in Settings app, go to System Icons → Do Not Disturb, and tap Do Not Phase. Once you do, you should see the DND icon in the status bar change to the current moon phase.
* Today, the moon phase is a beautiful waxing crescent, and that’s now reflected perfectly in the status bar courtesy of Do Not Phase.
* What do you think? Pretty cool, no?
