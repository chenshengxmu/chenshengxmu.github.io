* After shipping Fantastical 2 for Mac a year ago with tons of new features and a revamped user interface for OS X Yosemite and later, developer Flexibits today pushed version 2.2 of its calendar, reminder and to-do productivity app on the Mac App Store.
* Fantastical 2.2 for Mac brings powerful new features to the experience, starting with full support for Microsoft Exchange accounts with native account syncing, invitation responses, availability lookup, categories and people lookup.
* Other enhancements include availability information in calendars, support for printing with multiple layouts and a host of other under-the-hood refinements.
* “We launched Fantastical 2 for Mac one year ago, and our goal was to reinvent Fantastical itself,” said Michael Simmons, co-founder of Flexibits. “Today’s update is the biggest we’ve ever shipped and we think our users are going to love it.”
* Among other tidbits worth mentioning: there’s now a second time zone timeline so you can quickly view other time zones in Fantastical. You can now move and delete multiple items at once, start the week or month views on the current day or week and more.

* As for availability information, this feature has its dedicated user interface for checking other people’s availability information, as seen below. In combination with native Exchange support, it makes Fantastical a whole lot more useful in corporate environments.
* Availability requires a supporting calendar service, such as Exchange, Google Apps or OS X Server. Fantastical also has a native CalDAV engine which allows you to connect directly to other popular online calendar services like iCloud, Google and Yahoo.

* Current users can get the update for free via the Mac App Store’s Updates tab or through the in-app update if they purchased the app directly from the Flexibits Store.

* Fantastical 2.2 is $49.99 in the Mac App Store.
