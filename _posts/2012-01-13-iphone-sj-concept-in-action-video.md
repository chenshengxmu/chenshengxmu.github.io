title: iPhone SJ Concept In Action [Video]
---
* Last week we told you about designer Antonio De Rosa’s next-generation iPhone concept/tribute to Steve Jobs. The iPhone SJ looks like something Jony Ive could have cooked up himself in the basements of Cupertino, and now there’s a video of the concept for our viewing enjoyment.
* ADR Studios has created a video demonstration of De Rosa’s concept to show off his design ideas. Needless to say, we’re huge fans of his work, and we hope to see at least a few of these features in Apple’s next iPhone.
