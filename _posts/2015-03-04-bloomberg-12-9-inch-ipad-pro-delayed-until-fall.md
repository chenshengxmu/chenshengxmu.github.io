* Bloomberg reports Apple is pushing back the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro to this fall, following issues prohibiting the start of manufacturing.
* Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version of its tablet this quarter, as it hopes to boost its stagnant iPad sales.
* Apple won’t be able to meet its internal release target because of delays involving the supply of display panels, according to the publication. Now Apple plans to start production in September for a release later in the fall.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that Apple’s stylus as an optional accessory “will improve the user experience of 12.9-inch iPad.” It’s likely the tablet would be targeted in the enterprise, where new IBM apps could be used.
