* Fabless semiconductor maker Imagination Technologies has announced it’s putting itself up for sale, either in chunks or as a larger whole, just two months after Apple said it didn’t want to license its mobile GPU blueprints for iOS devices anymore.
* The iPhone maker accounts for about half of Imagination’s sales.
* The UK-based company’s share price immediately fell off a cliff as a result. Imagination lost 70 percent of its value following a dispute with Apple.
* Reuters reported Thursday that Imagination’s board of directors has “received interest from a number of parties”.
* The company said in a statement:
* Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group.
* The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.
* Analysts think potential bidders could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various Chinese firms. It’s unclear it Apple itself could be interested.
* Founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, Imagination had a market capitalization of 425 million pounds, or approximately $538 million, following today’s news. By comparison, the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012, or more than $2.5 billion.
* Two months ago, Imagination started seeking buyers for its Ensigma business and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013. The British GPU designer said it was offloading those businesses in order to focus on its new PowerVR Furian graphics architecture.
* According to UBS, Imagination’s non-Apple business was worth 81 million pounds in April 2017, or about $100 million. Apple, which owns an eight percent stake in Imagination, said in April it’s been working on “a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products.”
* The Cupertino firm should stop using Imagination’s GPU designs within 15 to 24 months.
* Apple was rumored to acquire Imagination last year, but the talks fell apart. Apple has since poached Imagination’s COO John Metcalfe along with a bunch of Imagination engineers.
* Without any Apple royalty contributions, Imagination could become a loss-making company.
