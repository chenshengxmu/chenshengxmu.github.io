* With the release of iOS 4.2 just around the corner, everyone is wondering when and what kind of jailbreak we’ll be getting. Even though LimeRa1n and GreenPois0n can’t supposedly be patched without hardware modification, the risk of getting a tethered jailbreak still remains.
* Comex brought up a bit of clarification about the iOS 4.2 jailbreak in a series of tweets. There is some good and some bad news…
* The good news is that “anyone with blobs for 4.1 or earlier should be able to get an untethered 4.2 jailbreak”. While this is not done yet, Comex confirms that the Dev Team is actively working on it. In case you haven’t saved your SHSH blobs yet, I highly suggest you get on it right now.
* Now for the bad news… Even though Chpwn is working hard on making Cydia compatible with iOS 4.2, the jailbreak might be delayed, at least until this compatibility issue is fixed. That makes sense: what’s the point of a jailbreak if you can’t have Cydia?
* I’m feeling pretty confident that we’ll get a jailbreak for iOS 4.2 relatively quickly. On the bright side, the unlock for iOS 4.2 and 4.1 is ready.
