* Tapbots today refreshed Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad, its popular Twitter client on App Store, with a trio of subtle changes, including the ability to easily return to your last read location.
* This nifty new feature where if you accidentally tap the status bar and scroll to the top of your timeline lets you tap the status bar again in order to return to your last read location.
* Don’t forget that Tweetbot’s settings let you decide how the app syncs your last read position. You can have it sync the read position across devices via iCloud or using the Tweet Marker service, which also syncs your read position with any Twitter client set up with Tweet Marker.
* Other changes in Tweetbot 4.8 for iOS include better line spacing in tweets that contain emoji and enhanced support for iOS 11’s new Arabic font.
* Today’s update is available at no charge to all existing users of the app.
* Tweetbot is a $4.99 download from App Store.
