* Dear Samsung, If you’re going to claim in court that Apple is copying your devices, then maybe you should think twice before creating a product that looks extremely similar to something Apple already made before, such as a phone charger.
* Samsung, as you can see in the picture above, the USB AC charger you provide with the Galaxy S II closely resembles Apple’s. As a matter of fact, if it wasn’t for your logo and the different color, we could think they’re both the same…
* We know you’re trying your best to be the #1 phone manufacturer, but finding too much inspiration from Apple products just doesn’t do you any good.
* Sincerely,
* Your friends at iDB
