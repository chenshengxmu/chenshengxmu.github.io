* A new prototype case for the alleged iPhone 5 has leaked via a Chinese accessory manufacturer working in conjunction with Foxconn. This case design comes from MobileFun, a UK-based site that claims to have received this information through its supply chain sources overseas.
* If this alleged case design for the upcoming iPhone 5 is representative of the rumored device’s design, there will be several major aesthetic changes made to Apple’s next iPhone— a curved back, larger screen, and possibly even a totally buttonless design…
* There were rumors earlier this year of Apple ditching the iPhone’s home button in the iPhone 5, and this case prototype also makes that assertion.
* “Steve Jobs originally intended for the iPhone to be buttonless, but found he couldn’t quite get away with it. It looks like he’s some way closer to that goal with the iPhone 5; the physical home screen button has been replaced with a touch-sensitive ovaloid area which takes up the middle half of the bottom border. This area might be used for unique multi-touch gestures, given its increased size.”
* MobileFun also thinks that Apple will move the iPhone’s side buttons to the other side of the device, and that the volume toggles and mute switch will be touch capacitive.

* Rumors of Apple going back to the curved back of the iPhone 3G have also been tossed around the internet, and these case designs affirm that speculation. The iPhone 4’s glass back caused several issues with repeated shattering, and it also factored into the ‘Antennagate‘ saga. Going back to a curved design makes sense. We hope that it’s aluminium.
* A larger screen has also been expected for quite some time, so there’s nothing new there.
* Overall, MobileFun’s findings prove to be interesting at the very least. This is by no means concret proof for what to expect from Apple in September, but case leaks like this can sometimes prove to be an accurate foreshadowing of what’s to come.
* What do you think? Does a buttonless, curved iPhone 5 sound good to you?
