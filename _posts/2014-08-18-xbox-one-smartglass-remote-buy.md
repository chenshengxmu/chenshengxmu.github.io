* Software giant Microsoft today pushed a nice little update to its Xbox One companion app for the iPhone and iPad, SmartGlass.
* Version 2.8 is now available in the App Store, providing a handy new feature letting you buy and install Xbox games and other content remotely, from your iOS device.
* Moreover, the application now supports in-app browsing of new and popular games, add-ons and bundles.
* You can even rate your favorite Xbox game clips and activity feed entries, as well as view shared Activity Feed and Game Clips — all within the app. And in a future SmartGlass update due later this year, Microsoft will add ability to stream live TV locally to your iPhone or iPad…
* Microsoft has confirmed the forthcoming live TV streaming feature in a blog post a week ago, which also detailed the just-released Xbox One firmware update with more than a dozen new features.
* Rather unsurprisingly, Microsoft is calling this feature ‘Stream TV to SmartGlass’. It will launch first in the territories getting the new Xbox Digital TV Tuner (pictured below) for the console.

* With the SmartGlass for iOS, Xbox One owners will be able to stream live TV across a Wi-Fi network to their iPhones and iPads.
* For those wondering, the tuner is not required for live TV streaming — its primary purpose is to allow non-HDMI boxes to be able to connect to the console.
* DVR-like features will be supported by Stream TV to SmartGlass: you’ll be permitted to pause, play and rewind live TV as well as change channels on the fly, without interrupting gameplay on the Xbox One.

* “This will work for SmartGlass apps on Windows, iOS, and Android,” confirmed the Windows maker.
* As for the tuner add-on, it’s set to debut in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain in October of this year.
* For those interested, here’s the latest August Xbox One update in action.
* Xbox One SmartGlass 2.8 changelog:
* Download Xbox One SmartGlass free in the App Store.
