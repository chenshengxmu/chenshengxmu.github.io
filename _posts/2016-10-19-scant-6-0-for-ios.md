* Scanbot, the popular PDF, document and QR code scanner for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, received a major update this morning billed by its developers as “our biggest release yet”. And it certainly is. In Scanbot 6.0 for iOS, you can now add, rotate, delete and move pages in a PDF at any time, use a new pen tool to annotate scans, print documents with one tap, run OCR on existing documents and much more.
* For starters, the app now has a simplified icon.

* As mentioned, Scanbot 6.0 now lets you edit your PDFs after you have saved them, including reordering, adding, deleting and rotating individual pages.
* Support for annotations has been enhanced with options for choosing between colors and pen sizes and a “direct print” button has been added as a new workflow option.
* Scanbot 6.0 also brings out support for new cloud services like Microsoft’s OneDrive and OneNote for Business, Amazon’s Drive service and OwnCloud, making it possible to save your scans to even more places than before.

* Another change: Scanbot’s character recognition feature can now be used to recognize text on your existing documents even if you did not activate it while scanning, plus you can now completely turn off the automatic scanning and cropping feature.
* Lastly, the refreshed app offers a more streamlined experience due to a few user interface and usability changes, like consistent swipe direction throughout the whole app and overhauled buttons that now feature a description beneath them.
* Scanbot 6.0 is a free update for all users.
* Scanbot 6.0 is a freemium download from the App Store, with advanced features like text recognition, theming, passcode/Touch ID protection, full text search, WebDAV and FTP support and much more locked behind In-App Purchases.
