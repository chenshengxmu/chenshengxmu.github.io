* The iPhone 6 may have the largest screen of any past model, but it is also the thinnest so far. If you prefer keeping your device as thin as possible, while still providing scratch resistance on the back, ultrathin cases are just what you need.
* The Maxboost Liquid Skin is an ultrathin case for iPhone 6. It is so slim that the company claims it is the “World’s thinnest” iPhone case, but Spigen makes the same claim. What is sure, is that Liquid Skin is practically as thin as paper.
* The 0.4mm thick case is made from thermoplastic polyurethane to protect from scratches and absorption. It is completely flexible, like a sheet of skin that slips onto your iPhone 6. It weighs a scant 0.3 ounces, so it will not add any noticeable weight or thickness to your device.
* The case was specifically designed with cutouts for ports, buttons, and camera lenses. So, your iPhone 6 is protected from scratches on all sides and the back. Because this case is meant to be as thin as possible, it has no drop protection or screen coverage.
* This inexpensive little case is well received by users on Amazon with a rating of four stars across nearly 1,300 reviews. It is available for $8 in ultra clear, and $9 in orange and smoky black. It is also available in ultra clear for the iPhone 6 Plus for $7.
* What do you think of this “barely there” case? Do you prefer it to bulkier, but more protective cases?
