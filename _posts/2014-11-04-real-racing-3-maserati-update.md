* Two months after its ‘Classic Lamborghini‘ update, the folks at EA have posted another new version of its popular Real Racing 3 game today that brings about new vehicles from both Maserati and Ferrari, new bonus events, and much more.
* The new vehicles include the Maserati Trident, the GranTurismo MC Stradale, and its limited edition race-spec counterpart. The update also features the LaFerrari—Ferrari’s first production car equipped with the F1-derived hybrid engine.
* Additionally there is a new bonus series, which includes over 100 new racing events. There is the Hybrid Hypercar Clash, Luxury Tourer Tournament, and the (exclusive to Real Racing) Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale R3 World Tour.
* Real Racing 3 has received a number of nice updates in recent months, but users are still waiting for iPhone 6 support and Metal integration. Nevertheless, the game still looks and plays great, and is worth picking up in the App Store for free.
