* Games maker Blizzard on Monday unleashed its long-expected ‘Goblins vs Gnomes’ expansion pack for the popular card trading RPG game, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.
* In addition to as many as 120 new cards and a Spectator mode allowing third-parties to watch game matches, the expansion brings out a new Mech minion type, both neutral and class-specific and allows you to control these powerful Mechs with special weapons and volatile abilities.
* Moreover, players are now able to tinker with minions using spare parts and even watch their friends’ games in progress with the all-new Spectator Mode. Our friends over at TouchArchade have put together a nice gameplay video, check it out below.
* Needless to say, you can get the new cards either by spending in-game coins or buying some virtual currency for real cash through In-App Purchases. The new cards are available at the same price as old expert packs and it’s great that players can now craft new Goblin vs Gnomes cards, too.
* And here’s the official trailer.
* For the time being, the expansion pack is only available in the U.S., with a release in other countries coming over the next day.
* Here’s your changelog:
* Download Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft free in the App Store.
* The Mac edition is available for download at no cost through Blizzard’s website.
* [Blizzard]
