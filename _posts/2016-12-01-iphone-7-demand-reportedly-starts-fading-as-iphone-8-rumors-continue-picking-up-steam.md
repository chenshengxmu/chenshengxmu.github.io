* Apple has enjoyed success with the new iPhone 7 family as the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus models saw strong demand, in some part due to Samsung’s Note 7 debacle. But demand for latest iPhones may have started to fade recently, forcing Apple to cut back on orders, Taiwanese supply chain sources told trade publication DigiTimes.
* That’s especially true with the rumor-mill in high gear regarding next year’s massive iPhone 8 upgrade and all the talk of the so-called Tenth Anniversary iPhone gaining all-glass, bezel-free industrial design and a wraparound OLED displays akin to that on the Galaxy S7 edge.
* iPhone 7 demand in China, Apple’s second-largest market by revenue, and in other key markets has reportedly scaled back substantially since the smartphone launched in September, prompting Apple to start reducing orders for the device.
* From the report:
* Affected by consumers’ high expectations on the next generation iPhone, makers in the supply chain are mostly conservative about the shipment outlook for the iPhone 7 in the first half of 2017, expecting shipments in this six-month period to be at least five million units less than those shipped in the second half of 2016.
* Unnamed sources from Taiwan’s handset supply chain claim that component suppliers and consumers alike have been shifting their focus to 2017’s iPhone refresh. The report states that the iPhone 8 may feature an enhanced processor and “advanced sensors” that will support mixed reality (MR) and wireless charging technologies.
* The Wall Street Journal recently reported that as many as ten different iPhone prototypes are in development. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted price cuts for 2017 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones with LCD screens to boost sales.
