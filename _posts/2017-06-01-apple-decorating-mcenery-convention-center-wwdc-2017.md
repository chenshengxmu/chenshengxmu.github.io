* As is typical with most Apple events, the banners match the design scheme of the WWDC 2017 web page on Apple’s site and the invitations that were sent out via email.
* The event is expected to cover a variety of things, ranging from software to hardware. It’s expected that the latest iterations of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS will take the stage, in addition to possible bumps in Mac hardware.
* There have also been rumors of a possible Siri speaker that will compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home, as manufacturing has reportedly already started ahead of the event.
* While we won’t know exactly what WWDC 2017 has in store until it’s officially here, you can download the official WWDC app for a full schedule and details about the event, as it has been updated for the 2017 keynote, and stay tuned to iDB for the latest news as it breaks.
