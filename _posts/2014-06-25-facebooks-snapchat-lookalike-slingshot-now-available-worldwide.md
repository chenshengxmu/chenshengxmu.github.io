* After launching in the United States last week, Facebook’s new Snapchat competitor Slingshot is now available for international users. I can confirm that the app is available in the Canadian version of the App Store, and it appears to be available in most other countries as well. If you haven’t downloaded Slingshot yet, the app is free on the App Store for iPhone… 
* From the official Slingshot blog:
* “Since we launched last week, we’ve heard from lots of people around the world who are excited to give Slingshot a try. Starting today, we’re expanding our initial launch and making Slingshot available internationally […] This past week we’ve seen people share such terrific shots, face mashes and drawings. We can’t wait for what happens next!”
* Slingshot is a new app for quickly sharing moments between friends, with a simple catch. In order for the recipients to view your photo or video, they must send you something in return. Just like Snapchat, photos and videos disappear after you swipe them away. You can also add text or draw on your photos, which is another feature borrowed from Snapchat.
* Facebook has long attempted at creating a Snapchat competitor, starting with its ill-fated Poke app that was killed off last month. The company even tried to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion, but the offer was turned down. So here we are with Slingshot, which Facebook is hoping will be its “third time is a charm” story instead of “three strikes and you’re out.”
* Do you think Slingshot will take off?
