* Apple has posted two new iPhone commercials this evening. The first one is entitled ‘Brilliant,’ and the second is ‘Discover,’ and both of them follow the Cupertino company’s recent marketing trend for its iOS devices.
* The spots start out with a slew of quickly flashing descriptive words, landing on a final one just before jumping into a quick app demo. And they repeat this a couple of times to an upbeat soundtrack. Check them out…
* Here’s Brilliant:

* And here’s Discover:

* Obviously the big focus here is Apple’s app ecosystem, which features nearly 800,000 titles. Some of the apps shown in the above ads include Cards, Maps, GarageBand, Infinity Blade 2, iPhoto, Starbucks, and Philips Hue.
* Apple must be getting positive feedback on this new style of ads, given that it’s already done a few for the iPad and iPad mini. But the flashing words seem kind of chaotic, making you kind of wonder how effective they are.
* Anyway, what do you think about these new iPhone ads?
