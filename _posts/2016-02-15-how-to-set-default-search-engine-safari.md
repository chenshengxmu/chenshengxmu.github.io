* Apple’s Safari browser has a unified search/address field at the top of the page, called the Smart Search Search field, which lets you enter a URL or search term, access search suggestions, history items and more.
* We’ve already detailed the process of turning off Search Engine Suggestions for those who don’t want to see suggested search terms and today we’re going to take a closer look at a setting that permits you to change your default search engine in Safari.
* 1) Go to Settings → Safari → Search Engine.
* 2) Select your preferred search tool in Safari. As of iOS 9, Safari has built-in support for the following search engines: Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo.

* From now on, entering a search term in Safari’s Smart Search field will take you to the search results page provided by your selected search engine. When typing a search term, you will also see suggested search terms from your preferred search engine.
* It’s worth mentioning that typing a query in the Smart Search field helps the search engine understand what you’re interested in—even if you don’t press Return to submit the search terms.

* To change this behavior, deselect “Include search engine suggestions” in Safari → Preferences → Search. Safari will no longer send the search engine your partial search terms as you type them. Disabling this option also prevents Safari from showing suggested search terms in the results list below the Smart Search field.
* 1) Launch Safari on your Mac.
* 2) Choose Preferences in the Safari menu.
* 3) Click the Search tab.

* 4) In the pop-up menu next to Search Engine, select your default search tool. Safari’s Smart Search field for macOS has built-in support for Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo.
* Tip: Desktop Safari has a neat shortcut for changing your preferred search engine without needing to visit Preferences. Just delete all text in Safari’s Smart Search field, then click the magnifying glass and select a search engine from the drop-down menu.

* This has the same effect as choosing a search engine in Safari Preferences.
