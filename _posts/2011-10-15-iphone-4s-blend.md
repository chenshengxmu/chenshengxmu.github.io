* You know it was coming, so let’s not beat around the bush any longer.
* Is this ridiculous? Yes. Is this completely stupid? Absolutely. Is this a waste of money? Totally. Will it blend? You already know the answer…
* Thoughts?
* UPDATE: As our smart commenters point out, they blended an iPhone 4, not an iPhone 4S. You can tell it’s an iPhone 4 because the iPod icon says “iPod.” On the iPhone 4S, which ships with iOS 5, it says “Music.” Busted!
