* Rdio, one of the more popular streaming music subscription services on the market, released a solid update to their iOS app this afternoon, making it quicker and easier to browse and interact with your content.
* Version 2.1 of the application features some gorgeous new design touches, and some other cool enhancements like a new long press-activated content menu, and music badges. The full change log is after the fold…
* Rdio 2.1 change log:
* I really do like the new long press feature, as it allows you to do things like share songs and add them to your playlists with one or two taps. And the new Badges feature is similarly useful, as it shows you newly-synced music.
* The stars of this update, though, are the new design touches that can be seen throughout the app. Rdio continues to build on that great 2.0 redesign we saw back in November of last year, and it’s now looking better than ever.
* At any rate, if you use the Rdio service, you’re definitely going to want to grab version 2.1. As usual, it’s available in the App Store for free. There’s a 7-day trial for non-subscribers, but after that, it’ll cost you $9.99 per month.
