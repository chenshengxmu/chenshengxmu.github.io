* Did you know that at any given time, Apple is offering discounts on hundreds of media items in its iTunes Store? It’s true. But like so many things in iTunes, these deals aren’t easy to discover and are nearly impossible to track. That’s where CheapCharts comes in.
* CheapCharts is a free app that helps you find and track the best prices on music, movies, TV shows, books, and audiobooks in iTunes. One of the best features is the smart wish list. You can add all your favorite items to the Wish List and CheapCharts notifies you when the price drops.

* Tapping on an image takes you to a very detailed landing page (seen above) that includes a summary, a really helpful pricing history, a link to purchase, and—depending on the type of media —a list of the cast and crew, and video previews. And if the item you want isn’t currently on sale, you can add it to your Wish List.
* On the left side of the app, you’ll find the navigation menu, which allows you to select the media type—movies, TV, music, books, audiobooks—and engage various search and browsing filters. For instance, when looking for movies you can choose to search for a specific title, or browse using parameters such as the IMDb Top 250 list, new releases, movies under $5, and much more without any advertisements or in-app purchases. It’s well designed, with an intuitive interface that makes navigation a breeze, and it’s chock-full of useful features.
* As you can glean from the screenshots, the app looks exactly how you’d want a media browser to look like. A big portion of the main window is taken up by a scrollable media stream that displays large album/cover art images. The images are crisp and the scrolling is smooth, which makes for an excellent browsing experience. Below the images you’ll find handy information such as user rating, critic ranking and pricing, and you can sort the media by genre, price, discount or release date.

* And with so many deals going on in iTunes right now, the question is, can you afford not to download it? CheapCharts is available in the App Store, and again it’s free.
