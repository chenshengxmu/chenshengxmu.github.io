* Apple and actors Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day, who have starred in the comedy show “It’s always sunny in Philadelphia” since 2005, are reportedly developing a straight-to-series comedy set in a video game development studio studio.
* Variety reported yesterday that McElhenney will also star in this yet-to-be-named half-hour scripted show, in addition to writing and executive producing alongside Day.
* From the article:
* Day and McElhenney will executive produce via their RCG banner. The series will be produced by the recently announced Lionsgate-3 Arts Entertainment venture along with video game publisher Ubisoft. Michael Rotenberg and Nicholas Frenkel will executive produce on behalf of 3 Arts, with Gérard Guillemot, Jason Altman and Danielle Kreinik of Ubisoft also executive producing.
* The Apple series marks their first collaboration as writers since “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” a show McElhenney co-created and Day starred and executive produced.
