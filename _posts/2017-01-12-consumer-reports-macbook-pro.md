* Following Apple’s software fix, Consumer Reports has updated its review of the new MacBook Pro, stating that it now recommends the laptop. The publication says the fix corrects the erratic battery behavior it saw during its initial testing, and all MacBook Pro models now fall “well within the recommended range” in its ratings.
* The three MacBook Pros in our labs include two 13-inch models, one with Apple’s new Touch Bar and one without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. (All 15-inch MacBook Pros come with the Touch Bar.) The new average battery-life results are, in order, 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours. We bought the three computers at retail, as we do with other products rated by Consumer Reports, to ensure that we are testing the same models a consumer would buy.
* In December, Consumer Reports said it could not recommend the just-released MacBook Pros due to inconsistent battery life tests, with each model running between 3.75 hours to 19.5 hours. Apple worked with the outlet and discovered that a software bug in Safari was causing the battery life woes, and immediately issued a fix.
* That fix is currently available to developers in the latest macOS 10.12.3 beta, and will be released to the public in a future macOS update.
