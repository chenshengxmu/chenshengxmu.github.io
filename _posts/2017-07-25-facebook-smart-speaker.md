* Facebook is apparently jumping on the smart speaker bandwagon, with a new report Tuesday out of Taiwan claiming that the social networking giant is looking to take on Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home and Apple’s HomePod smart speakers.
* Sources in the supply chain told trade publication DigiTimes that the Facebook speaker will be outfitted with a fifteen-inch screen built by LG Display and using in-cell technology.
* The housing should be made from magnesium-aluminum alloy. The report added that Facebook will focus more on image display than voice recognition functionality.
* Designed by Facebook’s Building 8 department, the rumored device is understood to have been scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2018.
* Contract manufacturer Pegatron has reportedly kicked off pilot production of the Facebook smart speaker at its production plants in China, added the sources.
* Apple will start selling its HomePod at the end of 2017.
* The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Samsung is building a Bixby-powered HomePod rival of its own that could launch later this month. However, a follow-up report from The Korea Herald said that it’ll be some time before Samsung jumps on smart speakers.
* “Samsung currently does not view AI speakers as marketable, as the global market is already dominated by unbeatable Amazon and the Korean market is too small to make profits,” a source told the publication.
* According to Engadget, Amazon, the leader in this space, is working on a next-generation Echo that will offer better sound quality and refreshed design, possibly releasing this fall.
