* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game klocki. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the popular puzzler for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving you a buck.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* This absorbing puzzler is so minimalist there’s no start screen, no logos, no instructions—it just begins. We quickly got list in the challenge of rearranging titles, Rubik’s cube-style, so a single line runs through each pattern. Our advice: sort out the corners and other unique tiles first, then the rest will snap quickly into place.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Klocki is available in the App Store for free.
