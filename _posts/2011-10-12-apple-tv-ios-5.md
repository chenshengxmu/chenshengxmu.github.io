* Today, Apple released iOS 4.4 for the Apple TV 2G. Apple did not release an official iOS 5 update for Apple TV users as expected.
* As noted by the folks over at Electronista, Apple did however release iOS 4.4 for the Apple TV. This update adds iOS 5 features, but is still called iOS 4. This update adds AirPlay mirroring, Photo Stream, and Movie Trailers. Apple also added some third party apps, such as an NHL app and a WSJ app for video consumption. 
* As expected, Apple also added improved software speeds to the Apple TV. The Movie Trailers app also has better search functionality. You can also mirror your iPad 2 via AirPlay on the Apple TV. The iPhone 4S also supports this feature.
* Let us know what you think of this new Apple TV update. You can download it directly from our downloads section.
