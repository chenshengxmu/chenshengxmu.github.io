* Well perhaps I should have restated that. MT Gestures will (hopefully soon) be an easy way to add multi-touch gestures to your iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.1. That’s because the developer, although they tout iPhone 4 compatibility within Cydia alongside the iPod touch G4, has admitted that the iPhone 4 compatibility isn’t exactly working yet.
* I can attest to this assertion, it isn’t working yet. But I will say that it has plenty of promise for those of you who shy away from manually editing .plist files in order to enable multi-touch gestures on your iPhone 4.
* What is working, however, is the new iPad-esque mute switch assignment options in the Settings.app. That’s a pretty decent consolation prize while we wait for the developer to iron the bugs out for iPhone compatibility…
* If you venture into the Settings.app and go to General, you’ll notice a new option for “Use Side Switch to” placed below your Auto-Lock and Restrictions options.
* Here you are able to reassign the mute switch on the side of your iPhone to act as a Rotation-Lock instead. I’m not sure how practical that is considering you’re on a phone and not a tablet, but it’s nice to at least have the option to do so.

* I think if the developer added an SBSettings toggle for this so we could adjust it on the fly, it would prove to be a bit more beneficial.
* Be aware that the tweak utilizes WinterBoard to fulfill its purposes, so keep in mind you will have to go into WinterBoard and enable the theme for your appropriate device.

* Once the developer gets the gesture part of the equation fixed for the iPhone 4, you’ll definitely want to put MT Gestures on your to-do list.
* It’s clear that the developer of MT Gestures is on to something good, and to be honest, I don’t mind waiting a bit for them to get it fixed up for the iPhone 4; it is free on Cydia for jailbroken iPhones after all.
* Have you been able to try MT Gestures? Have you tried it on your iPod touch G4 perhaps?
* What do you think about it thus far?
