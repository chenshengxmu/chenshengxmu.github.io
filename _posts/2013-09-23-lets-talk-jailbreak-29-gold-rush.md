* The iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, and iOS 7 are once again the big topics on this latest episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak. Cody, Jeff, and Sebastien all share their launch day experiences, and talk about their favorite new features to be found in iOS 7 and with the iPhone 5s. The trio also discusses the iOS 6.1.3/6.1.4 jailbreak, along with their thoughts on sacrificing a jailbreak for the sake of iOS 7. It’s our longest and perhaps most entertaining episode ever. You don’t want to miss the fun.
