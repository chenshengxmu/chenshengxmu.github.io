* Apple seems to be paying keen attention to the wants and needs of its users. Take this “new” gesture select ability in the stock Photos app for example. By entering select mode in the stock Photos app, you can now tap and drag on a group of photos to select multiple photos with ease.
* Oddly enough, this was once a stock gesture in older versions of iOS. In fact, I did a post on the disappearance of this very gesture, pleading with Apple to bring it back. You all can thank me later.
* Want to see how it works? Watch our video walkthrough for a flashback to the same gesture in iOS 4, and the reimplemented gesture in iOS 9 and above.
* Step 1: Open the Photos app.
* Step 2: Tap Select in the upper right hand corner.
* Step 3: Tap and drag from one photo through the range of photos that you wish to select.
* You can also deselect photos in the same manner. It’s also possible to select multiple rows of images with a simple swipe down gesture.
* Needless to say, it’s extremely nice to finally have this feature back in the Photos app. It means that we no longer need to rely on jailbreak tweaks like Photo Organizer in order to be more efficient when selecting multiple photos.
* What do you think? Are you happy to see this feature make a comeback?
