title: Breaking News- The iPhone 4 is Not Unbreakable
---
* After yesterday’s report that the iPhone 4 is indeed not as scratch resistant as Apple would like you to believe, here is a new proof that the iPhone 4 screen can break.
* Well, duh! Of course the screen can break if you deliberately drop it 4 times in a row. Does it really take a genius to figure this one out?
* This doesn’t really prove anything to me. Like any other cellphone, the iPhone screen is subject to scratches and shattering.
* What do you think?
