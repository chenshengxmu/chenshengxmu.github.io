* It’s been less than a week since iOS 9 was released, but it’s already being used by more than 50 percent of iOS devices, according to an Apple press release. The 50%+ adoption rate in less than a week is, as Apple puts it, the fastest iOS adoption ever.
* In addition, Apple reiterated its upcoming launch of the iPhone 6s, stating that customers may come to their local Apple Store on Friday, September 25th, as it will be fulfilling walk-in orders. Customers are thus encouraged to arrive early, as supply will no doubt be limited, especially if there’s a specific color/size/carrier combination that you simply must have.
* “iOS 9 is also off to an amazing start, on pace to be downloaded by more users than any other software release in Apple’s history,” said Apple SVP of Marketing, Phil Schiller.
* In addition, Apple is gearing up for the launch of its 9th generation iPhone, the iPhone 6s:
* “Customer response to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been incredibly positive, we can’t wait to get our most advanced iPhones ever into customers’ hands starting this Friday.”
* As stated, customers will be able to walk-in, even if they do not have reservations, but supply is not guaranteed. In addition, if you’re in a tax-free state in the US, or in China, Hong Kong, or Japan, reservations are a requirement.
* With all of that said, if you’ve yet to pre-order and plan on walking in store, it’s best to arrive at least an hour early, if not more. Last year I had success, and I arrived after the doors opened at 8AM, but that’s probably more of the exception than the rule.
* I’ll leave this post off with a couple of questions. First, are you a part of that 50% of devices already running iOS 9? Second, have you pre-ordered your iPhone already, or are you planning on walking in store on Friday hoping to snag one without a pre-order?
