* The United States retailing corporation Target is advertising a promotion where they’re giving away free Target Gift Cards for every qualifying purchase of iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Apple TV device from Apple. Free gift cards range in denominations from $10 to $50 and are good against purchases at the retailer, including iTunes Gift cards which Target has been offering for some time now.
* And if you’re planning on getting an iPhone 5 from Target, the retailer just sweetened the deal by throwing in a $25 coupon and reducing the entry-level 16GB model down to $149.99 with a qualifying two-year plan…
* The flyer promoting Target’s offer was first reported on by Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac.
* Those in the market for a 16GB iPhone 5 with a qualifying two-year plan and data from AT&T, Verizon or Sprint will get a free $25 Target Gift Card right off the bat, good for iPhone purchase and valid for that day only.
* Target will also sell you an unlocked variant for $699.99 or trade-in qualifying cell phone in working condition, with the value of the device reducing your iPhone 5 purchase accordingly on top of the $25 coupon.
* Here’s the flyer, as seen in several major U.S. cities.

* A $99.99 Apple TV will net you a $10 Target credit. A 16GB fifth-generation iPod touch (new to Target) comes with twenty bucks worth of Target credits.
* Tablet buyers can get a free $50 Target Gift Card on either a 16GB iPad 2 or 16GB Wi-Fi iPad 3 purchase, or a $40 Target credit for an iPad mini purchase.
* The retailer is carrying other Wi-Fi and cellular models as well, though unfortunately you won’t get a Target credit should you opt for one of these.
* The offer is only available in stores with Target Mobile and is good while supplies last.
* Target has an iPhone app with Passbook support and offered iPhone and iPad discounts in the past.
