* A brand new version of Snapchat is now available in the App Store on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It’s a point update but don’t let that fool you as it makes a handful of things a bit easier. For starters, you can now finally preview a person’s public Stories without adding them as a friend. Before today, you had to add a contact as your friend to view their Stories so just this nice improvement alone could go a long way toward helping us discover new accounts and content on Snapchat a bit more easily than before.
* Snapchat 9.38 packs in a few other useful improvements.
* For instance, no longer do you have to long-tap on your account to access custom lenses, which was really annoying. Instead, tap once and the filters will load instantly.
* Next, Snapchat now lets you style captions for your Snaps with bold, underline and italic—simply tap a caption to access the new styling options.
* And lastly, big captions can now be pinned to any objects in your Snap to have them animate the same way emojis do—just long-tap the caption after you’ve recorded a video to use this feature.
* Snapchat is available at no charge from the App Store.
