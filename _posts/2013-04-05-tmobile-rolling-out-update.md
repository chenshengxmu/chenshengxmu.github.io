* Following up its iPhone 5 pre-order earlier today, T-Mobile has begun rolling out a carrier update to unlocked iPhone customers on its network. The carrier is preparing to officially launch the popular handset next Friday.
* We’d heard last week that the OTA (or over the air) update was going to include Visual Voicemail support and LTE support for compatible devices. But it looks like there’s more to it then that. Keep reading for the full details…
* UPDATE: T-Mobile has pulled the support page from its website, leading us to believe all this was prematurely announced.
* Here are the release notes for the update posted today in T-Mobile’s support portal:
* -Visual Voicemail
* -4G network indicator
* -Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS)
* -AWS LTE (T-Mobile and officially unlocked AT&T iPhone 5 only)
* -HD Voice (T-Mobile and officially unlocked AT&T iPhone 5 only)
* -AWS HSPA+ (T-Mobile and new 2013 AT&T iPhone 5 only)
* -Auto configures MMS settings
* -Auto configures Personal Hotspot settings
* -Auto configures APN settings for LTE connectivity
* T-Mobile says that in order to install the update properly, you’ll need a T-Mobile-branded or officially unlocked GSM iPhone, you’ll need to be on the latest version of iOS, and—here’s the fun part—your phone cannot be jailbroken.
* So it sounds like the carrier is implying that if you have a jailbroken iPhone 5 on iOS 6.1.2, you can’t install this carrier update. But we’d be interested in testing that theory, as it says the update “won’t change your software version.”
* Regardless, this update is well worth installing for anyone with an iPhone on T-Mobile’s network—particularly those with an iPhone 5. The carrier has begun rolling out its LTE network, and it should be in all major cities later this year.
* Have you installed the update on your unlocked iPhone? Tell us about it in the comments below!
