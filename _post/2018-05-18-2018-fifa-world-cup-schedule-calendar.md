* The kick-off for the 2018 FIFA World Cup of football will be on Thursday June 14th, with Russia playing Saudi Arabia in the opening match. With dozens of games happening in different time zones over the course of a month, it can be difficult to track the different fixtures, kick-off times, and venues. For that reason, subscribing to a calendar of the event might be a good idea. In this post, I will show you how to add the 2018 World Cup schedule to your calendar.
* While you can certainly rely on various apps to keep tabs on the competition, I have found that the best way to follow the days and times of the various games is to subscribe to a calendar of the event.
* This way, you can quickly see what teams are playing on any given day, and find out what time the games are scheduled for in your timezone. For such a competition, timezone support is essential because nobody wants to have to deal with trying to figure out what 4pm in Moscow equals to in New York. Russia being such a large countries covered by different timezones adds to the complexity of trying to figure out kick-off times in local timezones.
* The calendar that I have selected for you does offer timezone support, meaning each game will be displayed in your local time in your calendar.
* This calendar is also automatically updated as teams move forward in the competition. This means that when France ends up first of its group and moves towards the quarter finals, semi finals, and ultimately the final game, the calendar will update in the background to always provide up-to-date information.
* There are so many devices out there that can subscribe to a calendar that it is impossible to show a detailed tutorial for each of them. That said, the concept is virtually the same whether you use an iPhone, an Android device, an iPad, a Mac, or a PC. For that reason, I will only show you how to get the FIFA World Cup schedule on your iPhone or on your Mac’s Calendar app.
* If you are fully immersed in the Apple ecosystem, the best way to subscribe to this calendar is to do so directly from your Mac. This way, you can set the calendar as an iCloud calendar, which will then be synced across your devices. This means that, assuming your use iCloud for your calendars, you won’t have to subscribe to the calendar on all your devices.
* 1) On your Mac, go to the FIFA Football (soccer) World Cup 2018 Russia – Fixture calendar page. Note that this is not an official calendar because FIFA doesn’t seem to offer an official iCal feed.
