* We are finally going to see the long-rumored update to Apple’s set-top box this fall, reports BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski. The well-connected journalist says sources have informed him that the company plans to introduce a new Apple TV in September.
* Pacszkowski says to expect a slimmer chassis and new internals, anchored around Apple’s A8 processor. He also says the remote has been “drastically improved” with a built-in touchpad for input, and there will be a native App Store and developer kit.
* Of course, we’ve heard this all before. In fact it was Pacszkowski who reported in March that we’d see the updated Apple TV at WWDC, and that never materialized. It seems Apple decided to devote its June keynote to iOS 9, El Capitan and Apple Music.
* It sounds like everything is on track for September, though. The device will likely share an event with this year’s new iPhones, just ahead of the holiday shopping season, and is expected to facilitate Apple’s new TV service, which is also due out this fall.
