* Some very comforting news on this cold Thanksgiving day, as MuscleNerd confirmed today that the iPhone unlock for iOS 4.2.1 will most likely be released this Sunday or even before.
* This is good news, especially for those of you who still are using an iPhone 3GS or 3G. It is however not as good news for iPhone 4 users because there won’t have an unlock for iPhone 4 for a little while…
* The Dev Team has already released a jailbreak for iPhone iOS 4.2.1 with RedSn0w earlier this week. It is unclear at this point if the unlock will work for the latest iOS 4.2.1 baseband update, but it’s safe to assume so.
* So in short, if you’re on an iPhone 3G or 3GS, you will most likely get an unlock this weekend. If you have an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2.1, you’re going to have to wait a little longer (no ETA at this time).
* As usual, we’ll publish up to date news and tutorials once this UltraSn0w unlock drops. Stay tuned!
