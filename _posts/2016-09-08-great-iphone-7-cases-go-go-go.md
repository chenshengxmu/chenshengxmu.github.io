* Once you’ve made the decision to purchase an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, the next thing you’ll want to consider is what kind of case you’re going to get for it. With a starting price tag of $650, and some models prone to fine micro-abrasions, you’re definitely going to want to protect your new handset.
* There are several types of cases already available for the iPhone 7, including thinner slim-fit cases, bulkier rugged cases, and those with built-in credit card slots so you can leave your wallet at home. So we decided to round up some of our favorites in an effort to help you with your selection.
* Note: for those wondering, no, iPhone 6/6s cases will not properly fit the iPhone 7. While they are very similar dimension-wise, the cutouts will not match up properly due to the removal of the headphone jack and the redesigned LED flash/camera lenses on the iPhone 7.

* Speck is one of the most respected brands in the mobile device case space, and if you’re looking for a slim, slip-on case, you’re going to want to check out its Presidio line. These dual-layer cases are scratch-resistant, have a raised bezel for added screen protection, and are 10-foot drop tested to ensure durability. I like the Presidio’s unassuming design, with just a tiny Speck logo in the top corner, and there are several colors available.
* You can buy the Speck Presidio Case for iPhone 7 for $39.95 and the iPhone 7 Plus for $44.95.

* If the Speck case is a little too pricey for you, have a look at the Grip Case from Silk. It features a similar slim-fit, slip-on design and the same raised bezel to protect your screen from drops. It also has air cushioned corners for shock absorption, textured edges for added grip, and Natural Throw button covers that feel like right buttons. Plus, Silk will throw in a “premium scratch-resistant screen protector film” for free. Available in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Silk Grip Case for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $13.95.

* Looking for something a little more rugged? Here is the Protanium case from Trianium. Like Silk, Trianium has built up a reputation online as a solid case-maker, and its products constantly get positive reviews. The Protanium features 3 layers made up of premium TPU, GXD impact gel, and a hard polycarbonate spine for ultimate protection. It has cutouts for all of the speakers and ports, and comes with a lifetime warranty.
* You can buy this Trianium case for iPhone 7 for $13.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $14.99.

* Supcase’s Unicorn Beetle PRO series has been a hit on Amazon, garnering 4 and 5 star reviews from thousands of customers. This is the iPhone 7 version, and it once again features a dual layer construction made up of  a flexible TPU and polycarbonate hard shell. It’s shock resistant, has a built-in screen protector and it comes with a side mount clip with swiveling belt clip for carrying convenience and protection. Comes in multiple colors.
* You can buy this Supcase rugged holster case for the iPhone 7 for $19.50 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $21.50.

* Spigen is another well-recognized case manufacturer that has a knack for being among the first to market following a new iPhone launch. This is its Wallet Case, made of a material it is calling “premium synthetic leather.” It features 3 credit card and ID slots, a built-in stand with adjustable angle for watching videos, and a dual-sided magnetic strap for quick tuck-away. Available in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Spigen Wallet case for iPhone 7 for $16 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $16.

* If you’re looking for a case that can hold your credit cards, but don’t like the flip-cover wallet style, Spigen also makes the Slim Armor for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The Slim Armor case has long been a staple accessory for iPhones, offering both great protection and storage. It features dual-layer construction, air-cushion tech, and a sliding cover that can hold up to two credit or ID cards. This one also comes in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Spigen Slim Armor for iPhone 7 for $17 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $17.
