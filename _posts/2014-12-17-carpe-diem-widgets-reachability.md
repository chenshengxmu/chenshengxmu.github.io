* It seems like more and more tweaks are beginning to take advantage of the available real estate present when invoking Reachability. Case in point: Carpe Diem—a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to place iOS Today View widgets directly in the space that becomes available when using Reachability.
* After installing Carpe Diem, you’ll need to head over to the stock Settings app to find the tweak’s preferences. There, you’ll find a list of all of the available Notification Center widgets, both first and third-party. You can then select a single widget to add to the Reachability view.
* Most of the widgets that I tested played nice with Carpe Diem, but a few, most notably the ESPN widget, didn’t want to work. The developer of Carpe Diem touts the compatibility with first, third-party, and WeeLoader extensions, but clearly the tweak still has some room to grow in this area.
* That all being said, Carpe Diem is a welcomed jailbreak tweak, and a legitimate way to get more out of Reachability. If you have a widget that you’re always looking to view, then Carpe Diem can make it easier to stay in tune with what’s going on in your widget of choice.
* You can find Carpe Diem for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. What do you think?
