* All iPhones from iPhone 5s onward can record slow-motion video at 120 frames per second (FPS), but only the latest models powered by the A11 Bionic chip or newer, like iPhone 8 and iPhone X, boost the slo-mo frame rate to 240 FPS in full HD resolution (1,920-by-1,080 pixels).
* By default, iOS devices are set to capture slo-mo video in 1080p at 120 FPS. Here’s how to adjust settings appropriately when you’d like to shoot fast-paced scenes in ultra slow motion.
* Only iOS devices powered by Apple’s A11 Bionic chip or newer (iPhone 8 and iPhone X) can shoot 1080p/240 FPS slo-mo video. Older hardware (iPhone 7, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6) limits 240 FPS slo-mo capture to the 720p resolution (1,280-by-720 pixels).
* The following slo-mo filming modes are supported on iPhones:
* 1080p/240 FPS slo-mo capture also requires hardware support for High Efficiency Video Coding (the H.265 codec) built into Apple’s A11 Bionic chip or newer. The hardware older than iPhone 8 limits slo-mo recording to 1080p/120 FPS.
* 1080p/240 FPS video is viewable on any device compatible with iOS 11 or macOS High Sierra 10.13 though newer hardware may be required for stutter-free playback.

* iPhone 6 and newer, iPad Air 2 and up and Mac models from mid 2015 or earlier can decode 1080p/240 FPS video. If your Mac has Intel’s sixth-generation Core chip or newer, you’ll enjoy hardware-accelerated video playback.
* Thanks to the efficiency of the H.265 codec, a one-minute 1080p/120 FPS slo-mo capture session takes up about 170 megabytes of storage space on the device. Double the frame rate to 240 FPS and you’re looking at 480 megabytes per minute.

* As mentioned, the older H.264 codec is more widely used than its contemporary H.265 counterpart, but doubles the file size and limits 1080p slo-mo recording to 120 FPS.
* Here’s how to set your iPhone to shoot slo-mo video in 1080p at 240 FPS.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
* 2) Tap the Camera section in the list.
* 3) Tap the sub-section labeled Record Slo-mo.

* 1080p/240 FPS slo-mo video requires the H.265 codec for efficient compression
* 4) Toggle on the option labeled 1080p HD at 240fps.
* TIP: To reveal the hidden option for capturing 720p/240 FPS slo-mo video on newer devices, change your media format from “High Efficiency” to “Most Compatible” in Settings → Camera → Formats before revisiting this section.
* You won’t see the camera formats menu on unsupported devices.
* 5) Close out the Settings app and launch the stock Camera app.
* 6) Choose Slo-Mo at the bottom of the interface.
* TIP: To make iOS remember the last-used mode like Video or Photo, go to Settings → Camera → Preserve Settings and slide the Camera Mode switch to the ON position.
* 7) Tap the Record button or press either Volume button to start and stop recording.

* The video will be saved as a H.265-encoded .MOV file inside the Photos app.
* You can watch 1080/240 FPS slo-mo video on your iPhone like you would any other video.
* All iPhones since iPhone 4s have a 60 Hz display so high frame rate video looks pretty good on them. Playing back 1080p/720 FPS slo-mo video on desktop yields best results if your Mac or Windows PC is powered by a sixth-generation Intel Core chip or earlier.

* For best results, watch your 1080p/240 FPS footage on an iPad Pro.
* All 2017 iPad Pro models feature Apple’s ProMotion display technology which dynamically alternates the LCD panel’s refresh rate between 24 Hz, 48 Hz, 60 Hz and 120 Hz to match content movement. Opening a 1080p/240 FPS video on a ProMotion-enabled iPad Pro automatically boosts the screen refresh rate to 120 Hz for smooth, crisp playback.
* To choose the format in which your media in the Photos app is transferred to a computer when using the USB transfer method, select either the “Automatic“ or “Keep Originals” option in Settings → Photos, below the Transfer to Mac or PC heading.
* Selecting “Keep Originals” ensures your movie files get transferred to the computer as-is.

* Choose “Automatic” to transfer media to a computer without transcoding
* Changing this to “Automatic” will transcode videos during iOS → Mac/PC transfer using the H.264 codec, which increases compatibility at the expense of file size. Use this setting if your computer doesn’t support H.265 hardware acceleration.

* When sharing your slo-mo video using AirDrop or Share sheet services like Mail or Messages, iOS always sends its converted H.264 version to ensure maximum compatibility.
