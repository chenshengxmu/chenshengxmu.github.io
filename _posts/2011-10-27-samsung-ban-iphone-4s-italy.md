* Here we go again. In the pissing contest legal battle that has now been going on for months between Samsung and Apple, an Italian judge has once again decided to side with Apple.
* According to Italian news website AGI, a judge denied Samsung’s request to ban the iPhone 4S in Italy. While the judge turned down Samsung’s request, she did ask both companies to provide further evidence, which will be reviewed later in December…
* The case is definitely not closed, but it sure looks good for Apple. It doesn’t surprise us because Apple has won all of the legal battles with Samsung so far.
* I’m sure there is more to come, as Samsung will likely keep suing Apple in various countries.
