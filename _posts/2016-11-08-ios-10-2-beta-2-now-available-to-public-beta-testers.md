* If you’re enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, you can now download a second beta of iOS 10.2 to your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Apple yesterday released iOS 10.2 beta 2 to members of the Apple Developer Program and now the software is available to public beta testers, too. In addition to this new public beta, Apple also seeded macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 2 to registered developers today.
* If your device has an appropriate configuration profile, you can install or upgrade to the latest build of iOS 10.2 over-the-air via the Software Update feature in Settings.
* Here’s a quick video overview of what’s new in iOS 10.2.
* To get you up to speed, iOS 10.2 includes several new features like a set of new emoji characters, new wallpapers for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners, support for the upcoming Single Sign-On feature for remembering your cable logins across compatible video apps, Apple’s brand new TV guide-like application introduced last month and the same Emergency SOS feature that Apple Watch owners are familiar with.
