* Responding to market realities, British Airways has added boarding pass integration into Passbook via the new version 4.4 of its existing iOS app. “From now on, all new boarding passes will be presented in Passbook,” the airline said Wednesday.
* The refreshed app lets travellers download boarding passes on their iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac devices and add it to Passbook for iCloud sync and offline use in over a hundred airports worldwide.
* Although the company’s Passbook support is pretty rudimentary at launch, British Airways plans to enhance it by adding direct links from the Lock screen. This will also enable useful alerts whenever flight details change, you arrive at the terminal or your flight is due to depart…
* If you’re a British Airways customer, the company will send you a message via the app as soon as it updates boarding passes with Lock screen enhancements.
* They also advise users who are already logged into their Executive Club account to log in again to the account after updating to the new software.
* The British Airways app can be downloaded free from the App Store.
