* Berlin, Germany-based 6Wunderkinder, the makers of the popular Wunderlist to-do, task and list management app, is getting ready to release a major new version. The wait for Wunderlist 3 is almost over, developers told me via email.
* Filed as “our biggest update ever,” Wunderlist 3 brings fast real-time sync engine, top-to-bottom makeover with a beautiful new design and over 60 various improvements to put the fun back into note-taking, task management and list creation and curation…
* From the blurb:
* We love lists. They capture ideas, things to do and places to see. And when you share them, they influence the world around you. Wunderlist 3. Premiering Soon.
* Wunderlist 3’s revamped interface feels like a whole new app. It’s obvious that the team has painstakingly optimized every single detail and left no stone unturned. As a result of user feedback, much of the app’s focus is on a more reliable and way faster syncing engine.
* Other than that, developers took the time to improve performance and implement a lot easier way to curate and share your lists. “We’ve made over 60 new improvements to deliver a completely new Wunderlist experience that’s truly a delight to use,” explains a blog post.
* As they’re making final preparations before launch, developers shared a nice introductory video, included below.
* The app “is coming very soon” to your phone, tablet and desktop and we’ll be making sure to keep you in the loop and tell you all about Wunderlist 3 as soon as it hits the App Store/Mac App Store.

* Wunderlist for OS X is free in the Mac App Store.
* The universal Wunderlist for the iPhone and iPad was last updated in October 2013 and is available free of charge, too.
* Wunderlist Pro subscriptions are available via In-App Purchases for those who can’t live without more sophisticated features such as access to Files and Assigning or comments to communicate with your teammates about to-dos.
