* On the heels of its eyebrow-raising $3 billion deal with Apple, the Beats Music subscription service has recently dropped its annual membership from $119.88 to $99 per year, or $9.99 per month, making itself more competitive with Spotify and the like.
* If you’d rather not use your credit card (or carrier billing) for recurring payments, the service now allows you to apply promotional codes provided on the physical Beats Music cards, carried exclusively by Target and offered in several denominations.
* And conveniently enough, Target is currently offering 25 percent off Beats Music $50 and $25 gift cards, resulting in respective savings of $12.5 and $6.25…
* The $50 Beats Music gift card can be purchased for just $37.50, netting you a saving of $12.50 in the process. The $25 Beats Music gift card is temporarily an $18.75 value (a $6.25 saving).
* If you plan on subscribing to Beats Music, buying a pair of $50 gift cards from Target is probably the wisest move at this moment because you’ll save a cool $25 over the annual subscription cost of $99.
* These are physical cards so allow some time for delivery. The cards are offered in $10, $25 and $50 denominations, are good towards the Beats Music service and have no expiration date.
* You can redeem them over at the Beats website.
* The gift cards are currently only offered by Target, as part of Beats’ exclusive arrangement with the retailer.
* “Beats Music and Target have partnered to bring you exclusive offers and content,” says a notice on the Beats website. The Bests-Target deal includes gift cards, trial periods, curators handpicking playlists and experience tables where you can try Beats Music for yourself.
* Target is also offering a Beats Music Free Card, good for one month free service with any purchase in music or electronics. Note that Beats’ gift cards can’t be combined with other subscription offers.
* The Beats Music app for the iPhone and iPad is free in the App Store.
