* Internally code-named “D22”, the bezel-less form factor of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 was revealed to the world thanks to developer Steve Troughton-Smith who was able to uncover a glyph for the device from the leaked HomePod firmware.
* Thanks to another iOS developer, Guilherme Rambo‏, you can now watch the full animation where that now famous glyph is used.
* Guilherme posted the animation on Twitter. It’s nothing earth-shattering, but we though we’d better share this with you guys for the discussion’s sake.

* He isn’t sure where exactly this animation might be used.
* To me, this is clearly intended to illustrate that the user should bring up the device to their face.
* As such, it looks like something that might be associated with Apple Pay (because the Pearl ID facial recognition feature is said to supplant Touch ID—it’s that good, if not better).

* That being said, I’m actually more inclined toward it being used to instruct the user to hold the phone in front of their face to scan in the initial training process for the Pearl ID face scanner.
* It starts down and comes up. Usually the other way around for Pay.

* Other people have noted that it looks like an illustration of an NFC tap as part of the iOS setup process, but it could also be used elsewhere throughout the system.
* Where do you think this “D22” glyph animation will be used?
