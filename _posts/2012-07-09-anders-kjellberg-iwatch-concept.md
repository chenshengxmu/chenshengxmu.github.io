* Ever since Steve Jobs joked about iPod nano wrist straps during the September 2010 presser (“one of our board of director members is gonna clip it on to an armband as a watch”), there has been no shortage of futuristic iWatch concepts, ranging from ADR Studio’s James Bond-like thing to Italian designer Federico Ciccarese’s Star Trek-like wearable device with curved glass we told you about last week.
* If you can’t get enough of these, you’ll appreciate this one by Swedish designer Anders Kjellberg who earned our respect with a remarkable iWatch vision featuring FaceTime (quite logical, isn’t it?), Retina display (why not?) and a whole bunch of other nice-to-haves…
* The list of features goes on and on and includes apps (just an arm’s reach away), 16GB of storage, power-savvy Bluetooth 4.0 wireless networking (to stream music to headphones, among other things), WiFi charging and syncing, accelerometer and proximity sensors and built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
* Mini-apps for your timepiece. And why the heck not?

* If you’re scratching your head, wondering how on Earth anyone could possibly fit so many components inside such a tiny device, don’t sweat – that’s why they call it a concept.
* Hard to imagine maps on such a tiny canvas.

* The back should be Liquidmetal, I think.

* Maybe, perhaps, one day, who knows.
* If The New York Times’ Nick Bilton’s sources are to be trusted, Apple is considering “a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist”.
* Until Apple dips its toes into wearable computing, this remains the closest thing to a Star Trek communicator, based on today’s technology.
