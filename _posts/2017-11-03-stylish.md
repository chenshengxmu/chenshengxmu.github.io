* Looking for an efficient way to customize the look and feel of your jailbroken iPhone or iPad without breaking the bank? If so, then you might be excited about a new free jailbreak tweak called Stylish by iOS developer i0s_tweak3r.
* With this tweak, you’ll get an opportunity to transform user interface elements across iOS, as shown in the screenshot illustrations above.
* Stylish doesn’t have as diverse of configuration options as a paid jailbreak tweak like Springtomize does, but one should expect as much when a tweak is free. All of Stylish’s options are available from the tweak’s preference pane in the Settings app, which you’ll find post-installation:

* Here, you can configure any of the following settings:
* As you can see, there’s no deficit of configuration possibilities. The developer seems to have gone above and beyond the call of duty to cram a whole truckload of features into tweak, making it desirable for heavy iOS-modders who want an entirely distinct look for their device(s).
* A respring button can be found at the bottom of the preference pane, which lets you save your settings after making adjustments.
* Given how much Stylish can offer, it’s easy for me to recommend this tweak to jailbreakers that are looking for system-wide customization. If you want to give Stylish a try, it’s a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and 10 devices.
* What are your thoughts about the extensive feature set offered by Stylish? Share in the comments section below.
