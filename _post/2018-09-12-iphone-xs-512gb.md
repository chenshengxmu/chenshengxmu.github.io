* The upcoming iPhone Xs refresh may include a brand new 512-gigabyte storage option that should be perfect for the demanding types who need as much onboard storage as possible to store their 4K videos, high-resolution photographs, premium games, apps and other content.
* Apple has refreshed its sitemap ahead of today’s “Gather round” event and that may have been a big mistake. Even though the sitemap was pulled soon after, AllThingsHow has been able to dig up a bunch of secrets that weren’t supposed to go official until after the event.
* These include the bigger 40mm and 44mm sizes for Series 4 watches and a new 512-gigabyte storage option for the iPhone Xs family. iPhones currently top out at 256GB so the new tier would give storage-hungry users twice the room on the device for their apps and content.
* It’s unclear whether the new 512-gigabyte storage option would be limited to the flagship 6.5-inch iPhone Xs Max device or available across the whole iPhone Xs lineup, but this would mark the first time iPhones have offered half a terabyte storage—that much is certain.
* Apple typically charges a $100 more for each storage SKU. Due to its purchasing power, the company pays a fraction of that to source storage chips from suppliers. Apple.com has also leaked out new iPhone names: iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xr.
* Apple has scheduled its “Gather round” event at 10 a.m. PDT.
* As usual, iDB will be providing full coverage before, during and after the event. You can find information on how to live stream the press conference on our special page created for this purpose.
