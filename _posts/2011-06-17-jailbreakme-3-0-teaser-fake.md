* We apologize if you got excited about the return of JailbreakMe today. A rumor got started this morning that claimed Comex was releasing his iPad 2 jailbreak through JailbreakMe.com this afternoon.
* As it turns out, the teaser image (reportedly from Comex’s Twitter account) that started this rumor has been proved fake, and we’re back to the drawing board in terms of an iPad 2 jailbreak ETA.

* As you can see by the above tweet from Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd, Comex wasn’t planning on giving a more exact timeframe for his jailbreak. MuscleNerd also stated that followers of Comex that subscribe to SMS updates would have received the link to this image as well.
* The renowned hacker already said that his jailbreak is “almost ready,” and that’s all we have to go on.
* In regards to the iFans forum posting that started this whole mess, an iFans moderater got in contact with us and shared this information:
* “I’m a moderator over at iFans, where this was originally posted, and I just wanted to confirm that this is not a true story. This user joined the site purely to post this image in the hopes of spreading misleading information. MuscleNerd actually came onto our site and more-than-less confirmed that this wasn’t something Comex posted. If anyone follows Comex via SMS, they’d have received a link to this Tweet even if it was “deleted.” It’s fake.”

* The user account that posted (and assumedly made) the teaser image that started this rumor has been banned from the iFans forum.
* We’re sad that this news is fake, but we’re still holding out hope for an iPad 2 jailbreak coming very soon. Member of the Chronic Dev Team, P0sixninja, has assured the community that the iPad 2 jailbreak is being “diligently” worked on as we speak.

* At iDB we do our best to report the news and not this fake stuff, but sometimes we make mistakes. The truth is that there’s no exact ETA for the iPad 2 jailbreak, and we’re sorry for the confusion.
* Thanks for reading.
