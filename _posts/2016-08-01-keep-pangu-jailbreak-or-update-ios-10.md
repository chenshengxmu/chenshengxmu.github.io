* Pangu released the first jailbreak for iOS 9.3.3 last week, following a huge lull in the jailbreak community that left many with lost hope and the decision to just rock a stock device from here on out.
* Nevertheless, those who love jailbreaking have already jailbroken their devices again, despite a lot of issues that were reported about the new jailbreak.
* So now that a week has passed, what will you do – keep it, or update?
* One thing that’s clear right now is that you can’t have your cake and eat it too; at least, not in the near future.
* Right now, iOS 9.3.3 is the latest jailbreakable firmware, and it’s also the latest public firmware, but this Fall, iOS 10 will be released to the public and it will create a huge debacle for Apple users of choosing between the beloved jailbreak or installing Apple’s latest and greatest mobile firmware for iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads.
* Although Pangu has demonstrated a jailbreak working on iOS 10, it’s unknown when or if this jailbreak will see the public light, and we also know that as soon as Apple closes the signing window for iOS 9.3.3, there will be no going back, and no way to jailbreak again once you update.
* When this happens, iOS 10 will be the latest iOS firmware, and it won’t be jailbreakable until a public jailbreak is officially released.
* So this is where the tide changes.
* Despite the fact that this current jailbreak is a semi-untethered jailbreak and requires you to run an app every time you reboot in order to regain access to Cydia and all your jailbreak extensions and tweaks, it still works like any other jailbreak would.
* So is it worth it to you to keep it over iOS 10? Or does iOS 10 just look too alluring to avoid? We want to know what you think, so let us know in the poll widget below so we can keep a running tally:
* Will you keep your iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak or update to iOS 10 this Fall?
* I personally have multiple devices, half of which are going to stay jailbroken on iOS 9.3.3, and the other half will be upgraded to iOS 10. I will even have one device staying on an untethered jailbreak from iOS 9.0.2, so I’m going to be all over the place.
* As most people have one, or maybe two devices, it’s a lot more critical that they make the right choice. With macOS Sierra also launching this Fall, it’ll be hard for those wanting iOS 10 to resist some of the features that allow the two OSes to mesh together so seamlessly.
