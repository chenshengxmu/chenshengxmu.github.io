* T-Mobile may be two years late to the LTE party, but it has some ambitious rollout plans for its 4G network. In a press release yesterday, the carrier said it hopes to cover 200 million+ subscribers with LTE by the end of 2013.
* But not wanting to give up any ground to the Deutsche Telekom-owned company, AT&T announced today some enterprising rollout plans of its own. The carrier says it will add LTE to 79 new markets by the end of the summer…
* Here are the cities AT&T says will get LTE coverage before the end of September:
* AT&T currently has the second largest LTE network—which covers just under 300 million people—in the United States, right behind Verizon. Then there’s Sprint in third place, and T-Mobile, who just launched LTE his year, in last.
