* Apple’s boss Tim Cook was photographed looking over the shoulder of a factory worker helping assemble a Mac Pro at Apple’s manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas. The CEO tweeted out the image on his Twitter account as part of Apple’s ongoing effort to promote bringing back (some) manufacturing jobs to the United States.
* “Watching the Mac Pro come together in Austin yesterday, thanks to a team loaded with American manufacturing expertise,” reads the tweet.
* Although the new Mac Pro is not actually ‘Made in USA’, much of assembly work happens at the Austin plant in which Apple poured in about $100 million…
* In the meantime, Motorola Mobility recently announced it would shut down its smartphone plant in Fort Worth, Texas by the end of the year after making a big deal with its ‘Designed by You. Assembled in the USA’ campaign for the Moto X.
* Yesterday, Cook and his chief of online services Eddy Cue toured Apple’s new campus facility in Austin, never missing an opportunity to tease that “exciting” new products are on the way.
* Reflecting on his visit, Cook today tweeted out an image of himself (see below) checking out on the AppleCare team in Austin. “Our AppleCare team is the best in the world,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thrilled to see them in action yesterday on our new campus in Austin.”

* And right after wrapping up the WWDC 2014 keynote talk on Monday, the CEO posed for a group shot with some of the developers attending the five-day conference. “Thrilled to meet many talented developers, especially these winners of our student scholarship program,” reads the caption.
* Here’s the image.

* In celebration of developers, Cook during Monday’s keynote acknowledged that his company now has over 1.2 million registered Mac and iOS developers and said that the youngest programmer at WWDC is just thirteen years old.
* Last but not least, let’s not forget about the photo from a week ago showing Cook “sharing a laugh” with Dre, Iovine and Cue.

* By the way, don’t bother following @craig_apple – it’s not the official Twitter account belonging to Apple’s popular software engineering chief Craig Federighi.
* It fooled me, but only briefly.
