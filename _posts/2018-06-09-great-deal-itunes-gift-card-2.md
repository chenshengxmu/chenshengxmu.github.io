* Heads up iTunes users! PayPal has re-activated its popular iTunes gift card promotion via its Digital Gifts outlet on eBay. While supplies last, you can snag $100 iTunes gift cards for just $85—a solid 15% in savings.
* Update: Sold Out
* The gift cards are digital, delivered via email, so there’s no waiting for a physical card to ship. Simply visit PayPal’s eBay store, purchase the card, and you’ll receive a redeemable promo code in your email within minutes.
* Of course iTunes Gift cards can be used towards any iTunes content, including apps, games, books and movies. I always pick up at least one when they go on sale to put towards my Apple Music and Netflix subscription fees.
* Don’t wait, they usually run out of these discounted cards pretty quick.
* Buy for $85 $100
