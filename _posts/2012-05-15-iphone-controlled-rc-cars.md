* There’s no shortage of iPhone-controlled vehicles on the market these days. We’ve seen cars, helicopters, robots, and even tiny spheres that can be controlled with Apple’s handset. But we’ve never seen anything look this good.
* The folks over at iHelicopters.net, yes, the makers of the rocket-launching Cobra copter, just informed us that they’ve got a new lineup of iPhone-controlled RC cars out that we wouldn’t want to miss. And they were right…
* The company’s RC car collection comes in a number of different flavors. You can choose from gorgeous replicas of popular makes and models including an Audi R8, Q7, BMW X6, 5 series, or a more ruggedly-designed stunt racer.
* The cars are controlled by a dedicated iOS app, which interfaces with an audio jack transmitter. And judging from the video, they seem to be pretty well made. They’re fast, responsive, and can last for up to 60 minutes on a single charge.
* If you’re interested, you can purchase one of these awesome cars from iHelicopter’s online store. It looks like all models run just under $60, which is about middle-of-the-road for remote control vehicles.
* What do you think? Are these cars awesome or what?
