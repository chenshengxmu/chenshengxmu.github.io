* The long-rumored “iPad Pro” surfaced in a new industrial rendering on Friday, further fueling speculation that Apple is working on a larger 12-inch tablet. French blog nowhereelse.fr shares the image, calling the device the ‘iPad Air Plus’ and saying that the sketch is dated December 2014.
* The alleged rendering offers up dimensions for the Pro tablet, measuring 305.70mm long x 222.60mm wide x 7.20mm deep. Converted to inches, that’s about 12 x 8.7 x 0.30. These numbers line up with those seen in previous renderings of the device, which is expected to have a 12.9″ display.
* The sketch also reaffirms features that have been consistently rumored for the larger iPad. Note the stereo speakers—2 on top and 2 on bottom, button placement, and the missing Mute switch. There does not, however, appear to be a port on the left edge of the device, as seen in previous leaks.
* Talk of the iPad Pro has quieted in recent months, most likely due to the launch of the Apple Watch and the new 12-inch Retina MacBook. Bloomberg reported in March that Apple was having production issues with the tablet’s display panels, which have forced it to delay the product until fall.
