* It’s been a long road for ‘Jobs,’ the film about Apple’s leader and co-founder starring Ashton Kutcher. We first found out about the movie project back in early 2012, and there’s been non-stop reports, photos, trailers and interviews ever since.
* But the time has finally come. Jobs is set to open in 2,381 theaters around the world tomorrow, and wouldn’t you know it, two new clips from the film have hit the web today. They contain some new footage, so check them out after the fold…
* Here’s the first one from Yahoo! (via 9to5Mac):
* And here’s a longer clip from MTV:
* Early reviews of the film from its premier back at the Sundance Film Festival were mostly positive, albeit some proposed inaccuracies in the storyline. But that’s always likely to happen anytime you’re trying to tell a high-profile story like this.
* Perhaps most surprising has been the praise Ashton Kutcher has received for his portrayal of Steve Jobs. Kutcher, star of That 70’s Show and other bad comedies, was initially laughed at for taking the role. But it seems he’s risen to the occasion.
* I can’t wait to see this movie this weekend. In fact, it looks like there are a few late-night showings tonight.
* How about you?
