title: The Wi.U, Because Every Smartphone Deserves a Smart Charger

* Chalk this one up to another interesting innovation involving Apple’s iPhone. We’ve shown you the 360-degree lens and the dual sim case, now let me introduce you to the Wi.U. It’s the smartest portable battery charger you’ve ever seen.
* The Wi.U case pairs the iPhone with the battery charger through the device’s 30-pin connector. The charger has the ability to detect when your iPhone battery is getting low, and will automatically start charging it up…
* The Wi.U case isn’t just your typical portable battery charger, it comes with its own iPhone application. With this app, you can set a date, time, or even a battery percentage that you want the device to kick on at.
* There is also the Wi.U pad that uses a Powermat-like technology to wirelessly recharge the Wi.U case. The inventor of the Wi.U says that it should give you about 3 days worth of usage. This sure seems like a cool concept, but how does it compare to products like the ZAAGsparq?
* We may never know. Like many of the innovative products we’ve featured, the Wi.U is a Kickstarter project. This means that the company behind the product is raising money through Kickstarter to start production of the smart charger.
* They’re hoping to raise $20,000.00 by April 26th, otherwise the project does not get funded. At this time, only $3,550 has been pledged, so things certainly aren’t looking good. If you donate $100 or more, you’ll get your own Wi.U when/if they start production.
* What do you think? Would you buy one?
