* Facebook didn’t stop at ripping off Snapchat’s Stories feature with auto-vanishing slideshows on Instagram. According to a Wednesday report from Business Insider, the social network is currently testing a similar feature in its mainline mobile app.
* A company spokesperson told the publication that Facebook Stories will soon start appearing at the top of the mobile Facebook app, allowing you to tap each circle to see a friend’s story.
* Your friends will be able to tap through the photos and videos in your Facebook Story, with everything you choose to share automatically disappearing after 24 hours. Content in a Facebook Story won’t appear in News Feed or on your profile’s timeline. You will also be able to reply to someone’s story with a direct message.
* “The way people share today is different to five or even two years ago—it’s much more visual, with more photos and videos than ever before,” Facebook said in a statement. “We want to make it fast and fun for people to share creative and expressive photos and videos with whoever they want, whenever they want.”
* The feature is currently being tested with a subset of Facebook’s users in Ireland before launching officially in more countries in the coming months.
* It would seem that Facebook is adamant on rolling out Snapchat-like features across its main apps. Aside from Stories on Instagram—and now in the mobile Facebook app—the company recently launched a similar Snapchat-like visual storytelling feature in Messenger, called Messenger Day.
