title: Run for the hills, Galaxy S III ad assault begins

* I know this is an iOS blog, but today Samsung launched its Galaxy S III in the United States with much fanfare and we thought you’d be interested in some of the television commercials they’re running now. They’re shiny, 100 percent devoid of Apple bashing and way cooler than Samsung’s first promo video for the S III.
* You can also bet on Samsung bombarding us with more commercials for the S III in the coming weeks. If these two adverts are an indication (“the next big thing is already here”), I’m expecting some fast jabs at the iPhone (though Terry Gou would disagree).
* The question is, will Samsung’s latest baby become the first smartphone to outsell the iPhone?
* Of course, Android handsets collectively ship at least two times more units than the iPhone, but so far no single smartphone model has risen to beat the iPhone numbers.
* Here’s the ice-breaker Galaxy S III commercial.
* And another one.
* Notice the mention of “the next big thing is already here” slogan, which brings to memory last year’s anti-Apple advertising.
* The S III is also streamlined like the iPhone in that Samsung somehow managed to offer one version across all major carriers in the United States, the only difference being a carrier logo.
* It’s available today on T-Mobile USA, AT&T and Sprint and July 9 on Verizon.
* Apple sold 37.1 million and 35.1 million iPhones worldwide in Q4 2011 and Q1 2012 and Sterne Agee’s Shaw Wu today advised clients to expect 27 million and 25 million iPhones in the June and September quarter, respectively.
* What did you think of these commercials?
* And can the new Galaxy become the first phone to outsell the iPhone?
* I wouldn’t rule out this possibility entirely, lest with pro-Apple reviewers calling it “a technological triumph” and Samsung’s very aggressive marketing…
