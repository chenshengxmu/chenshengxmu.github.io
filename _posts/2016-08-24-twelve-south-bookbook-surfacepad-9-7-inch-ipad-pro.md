* Premium accessory maker Twelve South today added a new 9.7″ iPad Pro-optimized member to its vintage-style Book Book cases, three months following Book Book for 12.9-inch iPad Pro that debuted in early-summer. The company also said that customers can now pick up Surface Pad covers for their 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The new Book Book for the 9.7-inch tablet is priced at $79.99, or $99.99 for the Rutledge Edition.
* As for the  stylish SurfacePad sleeve for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it’ll set you back $79.99.
* As its 12.9-inch brethren, the latest addition to the Book Book family of leather cases features a built-in kickstand that tilts your 9.7-inch iPad Pro to an angle that’s appropriate for effortless drawing, painting and sketching.

* It also folds into upright mode and has a built-in holster inside the spine that keeps your Apple Pencil or another stylus brand safe and protected when not in use. Also, its reinforced spine provides impact protection while a soft microfiber interior keeps your precious iPad Pro in pristine condition.
* Book Book for 9.7-inch iPad Pro retails for $79.99 (Rutledge Edition is $99.99).
* SurfacePad, a stylish jacket that protects your iPhone or iPad without concealing it, is now available in a version for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This leather cover also features a built-in kickstand that lets you use your tablet at various angles and has built-in magnets for Smart Cover-like automatic sleep/wake functionality.

* Thanks to its slim profile and smart design, the SurfacePad can be easily used with Apple’s Smart Keyboard. Since the connector edge is left exposed, you can simply fold your SurfacePad into display mode and connect the Smart Keyboard to the magnetic edge.

* The sleeve is also available for the iPad Air, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini, with a version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro due at a later stage.
