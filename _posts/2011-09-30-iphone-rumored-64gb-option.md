* Adding more fuel to the fire, rumor ninja Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac reports that Apple’s next iPhone will come in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about a 64GB flavor of the iPhone 5, although there’s reason to believe that Apple’s focus on cloud storage with iCloud refutes such a claim.
* With rumors of the iPhone 4S combating the idea of completely redesigned iPhone, Apple could choose to offer a cheaper iPhone with only 8GB of onboard storage. If iCloud is the future, how does more physical storage play into Apple’s vision?
* 9to5Mac:
* “Following the news that Apple’s new iPhone N94 device has appeared in the Apple internal inventory system, we are now hearing that this new iPhone will come in three storage capacities. Given that we’ve also heard from manufacturing sources that Apple has at least been prototyping 64GB versions of the new iPhone, we would say it’s fairly likely that Apple’s new iPhone will come in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities; just like the iPad.”
* The infamous iPhone 4S apparently showed up in Apple’s internal database yesterday alongside another iPhone model (assumedly a 8GB version) and three iPod touch capacities.
* Coming from the same source, known only as Mr. X, it is believed that there will either be 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB verisons of the next iPhone, or that Apple will match the iPhone’s storage offerings with the iPad’s. All capacities will be offered in black and white.
* Providing that Apple does introduce a 8GB iPhone 4 for a cheaper price, it doesn’t really make sense for there to be a 8GB iPhone 4S as well.
* Will 64GB of storage for a high end iPhone model entice consumers this Fall? With iCloud and increasingly better options for wireless storage, a 64GB iPhone seems contradictory to how people are accessing data online.
* What do you think?
