* Highly-regarded NPD DisplaySearch issued a new research note late last night, offering up several bold predictions for Apple’s future product plans. It believes the company is preparing to revamp the displays across nearly all of its devices.
* Among the forecasts, the marketing research firm says it agrees with the rumors that the new iPad mini Apple is expected to unveil later this month will have a Retina display. And it also concurs with the ongoing ‘larger iPhone screen’ chatter…
* From the NPD DisplaySearch blog (via CNET):
* “However, rapid developments in technology and manufacturing of LCD and OLED displays have challenged Apple’s leadership in display adoption. Apple is no longer able to offer unique features in its displays as a long-term differentiator.
* …Introduction of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the latest example that Apple has been slow in adopting the latest display technologies. While 5-6” FHD resolution displays are rapidly growing in the smart phone market, the iPhone has stayed with the 4” 1136×640 screen for over a year and a half. In tablet PCs as well, Apple was once the initiator of advanced displays, but now has become a follower.”
* Citing supply chain research, DisplaySearch’s David Hsieh says the firm believes Apple is planning to revamp nearly all of the displays in its products over the next year including iPad, iPhone, MacBook Air, and a few that have yet to be released.
* Here’s a breakdown of all of the predictions:

* For those keeping score at home, this is like the 10th or 11th report we’ve seen that calls for a larger iPhone in 2014. While the display size fluctuates between 4.5-inches and 6-inches, everyone seems to agree that the handset is getting upsized.
* And the same goes for the Retina iPad mini, which seems to be all but a given at this point. We’ve also heard more than once that Apple’s iWatch will feature an AMOLED display, and iTV a 4k display, but both are still myths at this point.
* The good news is, it looks like we’re going to be able to start testing the rumor mill’s accuracy in just a few weeks. Late yesterday afternoon, AllThingsD reported that Apple will be holding its highly anticipated iPad event on October 22.
