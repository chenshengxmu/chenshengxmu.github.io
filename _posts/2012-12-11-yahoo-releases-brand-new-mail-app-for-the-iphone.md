* Surely you must remember Yahoo! Mail? The more than 310 million people who still use it swear it’s the best webmail service out there, bar none. If you’re a fan of Yahoo’s email offering, you’ll be delighted to learn that the search firm today released a brand new iOS email client. It’s got the basic you’d want from an email app nailed: the clean inbox view with infinite scrolling, auto-complete for email addresses you type, notifications for incoming email messages, multiple message selection, swiping left and right for quick access to options, in-line images, search across folders and more…
* Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer  noted in a blog post that her company is also releasing today the Mail app for Android and Windows 8 while updating the web interface with speed in mind:
* We’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind – getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages.
* And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices.
* I’m all for consistency and have a feeling that Yahoo’s new mantra could have a lot to do with Google streamlining the look and feel of their mobile apps across platform (Google+, Chrome and Gmail apps come to mind).

* iTunes release notes:
* Stay connected • Access your inbox in just one tap • Receive automatic notifications for new messages • Quickly scan messages in your inbox with continuous scroll
* Message with ease • Auto complete email addresses as you type • Simply swipe left on any message to delete, flag, move, mark as read and more • Multi-select messages to organize your inbox faster
* Get more done, faster • Easily attach photos or take new ones while composing a message • Preview photos right at the top of a message • Search through all messages across all folders
* You gotta love how the sliding panels are becoming a norm with iOS apps.

* Yahoo! Mail is a free download for the iPhone and iPod touch. Android fans can download a version for their device over at Google’s Play Store while Windows 8 fans are advised to check the Windows Store.
* I wish they made a universal binary supporting the iPad natively so here’s to the hoping that’s already on Yahoo’s features list for one of future updates.
