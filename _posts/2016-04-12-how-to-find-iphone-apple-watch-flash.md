* Apple Watch owners can easily find their misplaced iPhone by tapping a dedicated icon in Control Center, which causes their connected iPhone to emit a high pitched sound. I’ve been using this trick since Apple Watch came out to locate my iPhone, which shows an unnerving tendency to disappear under a pile of laundry or slide sneakily between the couch cushions.
* You can find your iPhone even faster by having its LED flash illuminate a few times when pinged from your wrist, here’s how.
* 1) Swipe up on your watch face to bring up Control Center.
* 2) Tap and hold the Ping icon.
* This will cause your iPhone’s LED flash to illuminate a few times.
* Not only shall you hear the ping, you’ll also see where your misplaced phone is. This is tremendously useful when attempting to locate a misplaced device in pitch dark conditions, even if your iPhone is face-up.
* Tapping the icon without holding it produces standard pinging sound.
