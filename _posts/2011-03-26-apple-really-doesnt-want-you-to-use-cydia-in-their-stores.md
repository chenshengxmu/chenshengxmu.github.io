* If you connect to an Apple Store wifi network and try to go to Cydia, you’ll get a nice little surprise. Instead of loading Cydia as it is supposed to do, you will be redirected to Apple’s own website.
* I think it’s kind of a funny way for Apple to let you know they’re watching you and won’t let you pwn them in their own store…
* What do you think?
