title: Apple responds to the iOS 6.1 Lock screen glitch, says a fix is underway
---
* Earlier this morning iDB warned you of a newly discovered security flaw in the recently released iOS 6.1 software. It’s not the end of the world, but it isn’t dismissible either as intruders can easily gain access to your iPhone and potentially compromise your data using a simple trick.
* In a nutshell, in order to exploit the vulnerability one simply has to make and immediately cancel an emergency call on the Lock screen and then hold down the Sleep/Wake button twice. But worry not, privacy buffs, says Apple. The Cupertino company is aware of the issue, a solution is being worked on and a fix will be pushed in a future iOS software update. There, feeling better now?
* AllThingsD was able to get the following statement from Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller:
* Apple takes user security very seriously. We are aware of this issue, and will deliver a fix in a future software update.
* To recreate this issue yourself, lock your iPhone then wake it up by pressing the Home button, slide to unlock, tap Emergency Call and hold the Sleep button until the power down slider appears.
* Now tap Cancel and punch in ‘911’ after the status bar turns blue, but immediately cancel the call. Next, lock the device, turn it back on, slide to unlock, hold the Sleep button and finally, after a second or two tap the Emergency Call button.
* While Apple, for obvious reasons, didn’t go into any detail – nor did it say whether or not the fix will be part of the next firmware update – the company should be commended for moving uncharacteristically rapidly to squash the 3G connectivity bug, having released a fix just five days after it was discovered in the iOS 6.1 firmware.
* In addition to this glitch, iOS 6.1 has also introduced a nasty Exchange bug which drains your battery rapidly. Per Apple’s support doc, the company is aware of the problem and will make a fix available “in an upcoming software update”.
* Meanwhile, in response to iOS Exchange woes, Microsoft has offered up band-aid fixes and Apple, too, said users can get around the problem by turning the Calendar for their Exchange account off, waiting ten seconds and then turning it back on.
