* For those of you already jailbroken when TaiG 2.1.3 launched earlier this morning, you may have wondered when you would be able to join in on the 2.1.3 fun. Sure, you could have always added TaiG’s third-party repo, but understandably, some aren’t comfortable with doing that for various reasons.
* Well, the TaiG 2.1.3 untether now has saurik’s stamp of approval, as it has appeared on his Telesphoreo default Cydia repo. This means that by performing a simple refresh on Cydia’s changes tab, you should see an available upgrade to the TaiG untether.
* All jailbroken users should immediately update to the TaiG 2.1.3 untether. This update includes fixes that we highlighted in our earlier post about the standalone TaiG 2.1.3 tool update.
* Here are the changes that you can expect to enjoy:
* Version 2.1.3 of this package removes some now unnecessary TaiG uicache files, and speeds up boot time on the iPhone 4S, a device that suffered from slow boot times post jailbreak.
* If you’ve yet to jailbreak, you can use the standalone tool to do that. The updated tool includes fixes for virtual machines, and hang ups among other fixes.
* I think it’s safe to say that the TaiG jailbreak has hit a level of stability that most users should be comfortable with.
* What do you say?
