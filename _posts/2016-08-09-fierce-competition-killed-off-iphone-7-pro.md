* Based on leaked components, supply chain chatter and analyst reports, it’s fairly safe to conclude that Apple will release two iPhone models come this fall—a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. For a while, word on the street was that a third, premium iPhone 7 model was in the works as well, referred to in press reports as ‘iPhone 7 Pro’.
* The logic was, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would have regular cameras while the Pro model would come outfitted with a dual-lens system.
* As alleged by a Japanese outlet, Apple has killed off the iPhone 7 Pro for good earlier in the summer after experiencing soft iPhone demand amid increased competition.
* Apple originally planned for:
* But then changed its mind:
* From the Nikkei report earlier this morning, emphasis mine
* Since the beginning of 2016, Apple has been grappling with weakening appetite for its premium iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus handsets across the globe.
* It is the first time that Apple has come under such pressure since it launched iPhones in 2007. The competition is so fierce that Apple killed off a premium iPhone 7 model in the second quarter, less than six months before its official launch in September, according to a source.
* Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched, the source said.
* So there you have it.
* Now we know that Apple has come to the realization that offering two iPhone 7 Plus models, one with a regular camera and a higher-priced premium model with a dual-lens camera, won’t fly with cash-strapped consumers amid heightened competition.
* Instead, the Cupertino company figured—and I’m glad they did—that they better build all of iPhone 7 Pro’s exclusive technologies, like a dual-lens camera, into the “regular” iPhone 7 Plus model without imposing a $100 premium on the consumers.
* As a sourced quoted in the report succinctly summed it up:
* This never happened before. Before this year, Apple never made changes to iPhone’s product line mere months before the launch.
* It has been a volatile year for Apple.
* I’m a strong believer in fierce competition.
