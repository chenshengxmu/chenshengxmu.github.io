* Apple might be planning to develop a single subscription service that will offer original video programming, music, and digital magazines. The service would bear some similarity to Amazon’s Prime service, according to The Information. 
* Currently, Apple offers an Apple Music subscription service that gives members access to unlimited albums, songs, and music videos. With this subscription, you also have access to original video content, such as “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke: The Series.”
* However, it’s no secret that more original programs are coming as early as next year. In recent months, Apple has signed contracts with some of the biggest names in Hollywood including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and other top-tier stars to star in big-budget dramas and comedy series. Because of this, Apple’s almost certainly going to introduce some sort of video subscription service that’s separate from Apple Music.
* Additionally, The Information says Apple will soon launch a digital news subscription service next year that builds on the Apple News app and Texture, the magazine subscription service it purchased earlier this year. Bloomberg also reported on the likelihood of some sort of combined service earlier this year.
* Texture, which was once called Next Issue, offers subscribers unlimited access to more than 200 digital magazines for $9.99 per month, with titles that include Entertainment Weekly, People, Sports Illustrated, and more.
* Though Apple is likely to offer its video, music, and news services separately, discussions are underway to eventually build an ultimate bundle of all three. Still, barriers remain.
* The Information explains:
* It isn’t clear if Apple would roll out some of its original programming for free initially and then bundle it with the other services, the people said. The discussions at Apple are still ongoing about what the subscription service ultimately will look like and could change, they said.
* No one wants to pay separate subscriptions fees for premium video, music, and news, right? Hopefully, we’ll hear more about Apple’s plans sooner than later.
* Doesn’t a September special event sound like a great idea?
