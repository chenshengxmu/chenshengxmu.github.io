* AVLock is a new free jailbreak tweak by iOS developer gilshahar7 that attempts to make watching videos more tolerable on the iOS platform.
* After installation, you’ll gain access to a new Rotation Lock toggle in the stock iOS 11 video player interface, precisely like the one shown in the screenshot example above.
* AVLock makes video consumption more tolerable by allowing you to lock your display in full-screen mode when a video is playing. The tweak prevents unwanted screen rotations in common awkward scenarios, such as when you’re lying sideways in bed.
* I know what you’re probably thinking: but there’s a Rotation Lock toggle in Control Center, so what’s the point of AVLock?
* The most straightforward answer is convenience.
* With AVLock being built right into the stock video player interface, you can easily access it without obstructing your video consumption experience. If you had to open Control Center to access Rotation Lock, then you’d either need to pause the video beforehand or scrub backward to see what you missed.

* AVLock works in both portrait and landscape orientation, so it’s ideal for almost any situation. In my opinion, AVLock seems like a must-have, and I’m sure many would agree.
* If you’d like to give it a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices. Furthermore, the developer open-sourced AVLock so you can view its source code on GitHub.
* Do you think AVLock is a useful addition to the stock video player in iOS 11? Share in the comments section below.
