* Tired of tapping that dreaded refresh button whenever you want an update to the latest happenings in your Reeder app?
* Fret no longer; the perfect jailbreak tweak for you has arrived in the form of Pull To Sync for Reeder.
* As its name implies so accurately, Pull To Sync for Reeder throws an additional syncing/refreshing option into the mix for your favorite Google Reader client.
* Now instead of solely relying on that little refresh button in the bottom right-hand corner, you can let your thumbs do the talking with pull down to refresh capabilities…

* As you can probably gather, there’s really not a lot to this tweak besides the alternative style of refreshing.
* One thing that did particularly bug me is the fact that you can only use the pull down feature when you’re in Reeder’s main view. Hence, you’re not going to be able to use pull down to refresh in ‘All Items’ view, or inside individual feeds.

* While that is kind of a bummer, perhaps I’m in the minority when it comes to the way I view my feeds. I normally like to view everything combined instead of venturing in and out of particular feeds.
* For a positive spin on things, at least this gives the developer something to improve with his tweak; though, it stands now, it’s quite capable and performs largely as expected.

* Are you an avid Reeder user? Have you tried this tweak yet?
