* In case you were not able to watch the iPad mini keynote live as it was happening yesterday, Apple made the video available for streaming on its website shortly after. But for those of you who don’t want to be tied to a wifi network in order to watch the keynote, you’ll be happy to learn that the whole iPad mini event is now available as a podcast download from iTunes…
* If that’s still too much and you don’t want to spend an hour and a half watching the event, then make sure to check out our video recap of the iPad mini event in 4 minutes.
