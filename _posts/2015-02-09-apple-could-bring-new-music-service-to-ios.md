* Apple plans to release iOS 8.4 in the coming months, and it could include Apple’s new music streaming service, 9to5mac wrote in a report on Monday.
* While iOS 8.3 hasn’t even hit the public scene, iOS 8.4 is currently in development at Apple, and is codenamed Copper after a popular ski resort in Colorado.
* 9to5mac reports Apple could bring the new music service to iOS in the coming months as part of iOS 8.4, though the company hasn’t made an official decision.
* An official release date isn’t said to be set for the software that will also bring performance enhancements, however it will be released after the Apple Watch becomes available in April, the publication notes.
* Utilizing features, partnerships, and the team acquired from Beats, Apple has been widely rumored to launch a paid streaming music service that will compete with Spotify and Rdio, thanks to deep iOS integration.
