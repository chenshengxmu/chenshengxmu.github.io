* Just about a week after Apple unveiled iCloud, it’s already being sued by a company called iCloud Communications over the iCloud trademark. iCloud Communications claims that the use of iCloud in Apple’s marketing could be damaging to their business.
* And they’re serious about it too, requiring Apple to “deliver for destruction all [iCloud] labels, signs, prints, insignia, letterhead, brochures, business cards, invoices and any other written or recorded material.”
* I know how all this is going to end: someone at iCloud Communications is going to get a big fat check with an Apple on it. How else would they work this out?
