* On the eve of the official launch of iOS 7, Apple has rolled out a new version of iCloud.com to the public. The redesign, which has been in beta for several months now, brings new icons and other elements inspired by tomorrow’s update.
* Additionally, every web app has been rebuilt to match its mobile counterpart, including Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes, Reminders and Find My iPhone. And the wallpaper now mirrors the dynamic, slow-moving wallpaper in iOS 7 as well…

* Last month we posted an extensive gallery of the new iCloud web portal,  back when it was in testing, and not much has changed outside of the removal of the word ‘beta’ from several screens. So if you’re looking for a full rundown, click here.
* Otherwise, if you’d like to check it out for yourself, you can head on over to iCloud.com and login using your iTunes credentials. Make sure to use the same account that you are using on your iOS devices and your Mac for proper syncing.
* So, what do you think of the new iCloud web portal?
