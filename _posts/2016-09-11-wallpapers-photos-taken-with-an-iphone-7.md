* This coming Friday, iPhone 7 hits store shelves and pre-orders arrive in the mail. The week between a pre-order and receiving the device is one of the most exciting times of the year for Apple fans. Immediately following the announcement, Apple litters the retail website with information about the new devices, including images that help show off the new design. When this occurs, I receive submissions for wallpapers via @jim_gresham, where you can send images for consideration and inclusion in the Wallpapers of the Week category.
* This year, as the design focuses on the camera, Apple included a gallery of images, snapped by the new iPhone 7.  Inside, you fill find a collection of wallpapers from the iPhone 7 photo gallery. Additionally, there is an interactive scrolling ad, that includes images of an amorphous colored orb, which has been turned into a series of wallpapers as well. Step inside for iPhone 7 wallpapers.
* The following collection of images were sourced directly from the iPhone 7 photo gallery via Apple.com/iPhone-7/, by iDB regular, @JasonZigrino. You can see more of his handy work via dribbble. He also has a large collection of images via iDB.
