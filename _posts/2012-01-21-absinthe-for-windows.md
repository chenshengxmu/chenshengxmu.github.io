* Absinthe – the graphical user interface jailbreak tool is now available for Windows machines. Previously only available for the Mac, the jailbreak tool makes it extremely easy to jailbreak your iPhone 4S or iPad 2 in a matter of minutes.
* Windows users have had another option to hold them over in the meantime; the iPhone Dev Team released a command line utility that worked well, but could prove to be daunting for some users. Thankfully that is no longer an issue. Check inside for more information and download locations for Absinthe for Windows…
* If you’re a Windows user looking to jailbreak your A5 device, this is your best option. The app is exactly like its Mac counterpart, allowing you to load the untethered exploit onto your iPad 2 or iPhone 4S in a matter of minutes using an easy to use graphical interface.
* As we’ve mentioned before, the new jailbreak works with the iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1, and the iPhone 4S running both iOS 5.0 and 5.0.1. And remember, those planning on unlocking their iPhones in the future, should stay on iOS 5.0.
