* As it has done every December since 2009, Apple has published an iTunes page today highlighting the top performing downloads in its various digital storefronts. The page covers everything from apps to games, to books and movies.
* Apple named Duolingo, a free app that teaches you how to speak in different languages, its iPhone App of the Year and the popular ‘Ridiculous Fishing – A Tale of Redemption’ its iPhone Game of the Year. More top picks after the fold…
* There’s a few categories and several honorable mentions that aren’t listed here. So when you get a second, it really is worth looking over the entire ‘Best of 2013’ page in iTunes.
* What do you think about this year’s top picks?
