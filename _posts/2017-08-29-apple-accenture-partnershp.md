* Apple on Tuesday announced a major partnership with global management consulting and professional services company Accenture to help accelerate the development of modern iPhone and iPad apps for big business.
* The companies will launch a new set of tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad.
* Accenture will create a dedicated iOS practice within Accenture Digital Studios in select locations around the world, with Apple’s experts co-located with Accenture’s team.
* These experts will include visual and experience designers, programmers, data architects and scientists, as well as hardware and software designers, the iPhone maker has said.
* Key highlights include:
* Tim Cook commented on the deal:
* Starting ten years ago with iPhone, and then with iPad, Apple has been transforming how work gets done, yet we believe that businesses have only just begun to scratch the surface of what they can do with our products.
* Both Apple and Accenture are leaders in building incredible user experiences and together we can continue to truly modernize how businesses work through amazing solutions that take advantage of the incredible capabilities of Apple’s technologies.
* Accenture CEO and Chairman, Pierre Nanterme, said that based on their experience in developing mobile apps, they believe that iOS is “the superior mobile platform for businesses”.
