* In our continuing Wallpapers of the Week series, geometric walls have been a continued success. Popularly determined by traffic and social shares, previous geometry based wallpapers are crowd pleasers. In today’s section we dive a little further into the genre, hopefully to your delight!
* Inside, you will find a collection of five new wallpapers. Step past the fold for the download. 
* Below, is a set of images created by @kiwimanjaro. You can find a full gallery of images by kiwi via an online gallery at Sweet as Apple.
* The wallpapers are selected each week based on images found around the Internet or stumbled upon by me via Twitter @jim_gresham. If you have anything to share, make sure to drop a link.
