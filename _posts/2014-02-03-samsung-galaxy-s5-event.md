* Outside of maybe Apple’s next-gen iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S5 is probably one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2014. The Galaxy line has gained a reputation for bringing about new and innovative features, and it has built up quite the following.
* We were expecting to see the S5 appear sometime in March or April, but it looks like it could land much sooner than that. Samsung just sent out a round of press invitations for Samsung Unpacked 5, a media event to be held in Barcelona on February 24…
* Here’s the press release from Samsung’s blog (via ArsTechnica):
* “You’ve been waiting for a long time for this. Samsung Unpacked 2014 Episode 1 is coming up! 
* At previous Samsung Unpacked events, we’ve shown you the ‘The Next Big Thing.’ On March 2013, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4, on September 2013, Galaxy Note 3 and Gear. These events were also live-streamed on official Samsung channels. Live blogging was also available on Samsung Tomorrow.
* At the Samsung Unpacked 2014 on Monday, February, 2014 what can you expect to see? Mark the date and come visit us to see the unpacking of The Next Big Thing(?.. even the Samsung Tomorrow team doesn’t know yet), live on global.samsungtomorrow.com”
* It doesn’t say so specifically, but the consensus is the event is going to be used to introduce the Galaxy S5. Granted, Samsung hasn’t unveiled a phone at Mobile World Congress since 2011, but it’s hard to imagine what else this Unpacked event could be for.
* Rumors regarding S5 specs and features have been plentiful. The handset is expected to feature a 1440p display, a 64-bit eight-core processor, 4GB of RAM, a 4,000 mAh battery and a 16MP camera. And it’s expected to come in  metal and plastic flavors.

* It’ll be interesting to see if these numbers hold true. The Galaxy line is by far the iPhone’s most direct competitor, and if these specs pan out, Apple certainly has its work cut out for it. The good news is, it’s planning some major upgrades of its own for iPhone 6.
* But it appears Samsung will strike first. The Unpacked 5 (Episode 1, evidently) event is scheduled to begin at 2pm Eastern, 11am Pacific and will be livestreamed at http://youtube.com/samsungmobile. And obviously, we’ll be on hand for our usual recap.
* Thoughts?
