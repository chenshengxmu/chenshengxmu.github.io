* Apple is said to kick off its annual Back To School promotion tomorrow in the United States and select other countries with an interesting iTunes Gift Card lure for educational customers purchasing qualifying products.
* Unlike past years, this year’s Back To School will reportedly include the iPad for the first time…
* MacRumors has the story:
* The major new addition to the program this year is the iPad, with purchasers receiving a $50 iTunes Store gift card with the purchase of a new iPad.
* Macs also qualify:
* The Mac aspect of the program appears to be the same as in previous years, with qualified purchases earning a $100 gift card. We have not yet confirmed exactly which Mac systems will qualify for the program, but in past years the Mac mini has not been eligible for the promotion.
* Users can use iTunes Gift Card toward any content purchase on any of Apple’s store, including digital books, mobile and desktop applications, music, television shows, movies and other content types.
