* Apple and SAP announced a new partnership on Thursday, which they hope will “revolutionize the mobile work experience for enterprise customers of all sizes.” The joint effort will combine powerful native iOS apps with the cutting edge capabilities of SAP’s HANA platform.
* The two companies also plan to deliver a new SAP HANA Cloud Platform SDK exclusively for iOS that will provide businesses and developers the tools to build their own enterprise apps. And, as part of the deal, SAP will develop native iOS apps for critical business operations.
* “This partnership will transform how iPhone and iPad are used in enterprise by bringing together the innovation and security of iOS with SAP’s deep expertise in business software,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As the leader in enterprise software and with 76% of business transactions touching an SAP system, SAP is the ideal partner to help us truly transform how businesses around the world are run on iPhone and iPad. Through the new SDK, we’re empowering SAP’s more than 2.5 million developers to build powerful native apps that fully leverage SAP HANA Cloud Platform and tap into the incredible capabilities that only iOS devices can deliver.”
* “We’re proud to take this special partnership between Apple and SAP to a groundbreaking new place,” said Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP. “In giving people an agile and intuitive business experience, we empower them to know more, care more and do more. By combining the powerful capabilities of SAP HANA Cloud Platform and SAP S/4HANA, together with iOS, the leading and most secure mobile platform for enterprise, we will help deliver live data to people wherever and whenever they choose to work. Apple and SAP share a commitment to shaping the future, helping the world run better and improving people’s lives.” 
* As growth slows in the consumer space, Apple continues to show increasing interest in enterprise. In 2014, the company announced a major partnership with IBM. SAP is also a major coup for the iPhone-maker, as it services more than 300,000 business and public sector customers.
