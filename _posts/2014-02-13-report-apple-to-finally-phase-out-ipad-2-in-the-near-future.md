* Nearly three years following its March 2011 debut, Apple is finally set to discontinue its second-generation iPad. The iPad 2 was arguably the most important iPad refresh in history, bringing a major redesign from the original iPad, VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling and image capture, magnetic Smart Covers and substantial speed increases courtesy of the Apple-designed dual-core A5 processor.
* According to a new report, customers are “resoundingly” buying more of the iPad Air and iPad mini, prompting Apple’s leadership to decrease iPad 2 production going forward…
* AppleInsider learned from sources:
* According to people familiar with Apple’s plans, the company has made the decision to ramp down iPad 2 production given that customers are resoundingly shifting purchases towards its more modern and capable iPads, namely the iPad mini and iPad Air.
* The story stopped short of specifying when exactly Apple might stop selling the iPad 2 as its stocks wind down.
* After refreshing the iPad lineup last October, Apple surprised watchers by keeping the iPad 2 on the market. The device proved extremely popular not only with regular buyers, but with corporate and education markets as well.
* This is in part due to its compatibility with tons of 30-pin Dock connector accessories and mostly because the iPad 2 is the cheapest full-size iPad. Note that the device is currently the only remaining Dock Connector iPad in Apple’s lineup.
* The Wi-Fi-only model with sixteen gigabytes of storage is a $399 value, the same as the iPad mini with Retina display. The 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular variant costs $529.
* Walmart’s most recent promotion has brought the Wi-Fi iPad 2 down to a more bearable $299 in the form of an electronic $100 gift card.
* According to a recent survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the iPad 2 is still selling surprisingly well given its age, making up 22 percent of Apple’s tablet sales in the September quarter.
