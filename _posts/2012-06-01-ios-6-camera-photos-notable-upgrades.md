* Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu writes in today’s note to clients that Apple is working on a “notable upgrade” to its stock Camera and Photos apps which come included with the iOS mobile operating system powering iPhones, iPads and iPods.
* This isn’t terribly surprising given that “notable upgrades” are presumably needed to enable new photo and video sharing functionalities recently mentioned by more credible sources.
* I guess Wu’s a regular reader of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which reported last month that iOS 6 will bring the ability to synchronize video clips across devices through iCloud, as well as share sets of photos with other iCloud users and comment on them…
* As you know, iCloud in its current incarnation syncs only photos and stock Camera and Photos apps offer only bare-bone features.
* According to AppleInsider, which relayed Wu’s note to clients, the analyst “speculated that the changes would make it less necessary for iPhone users to rely on third-party applications like Instagram”.
* As for iOS Photos and Camera apps, Apple CEO Tim Cook said at this week’s D10 conference that Apple had no interest in buying Instagram, which was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in April.
* With Facebook now reportedly shopping for a video sharing service, the new Facebook Camera app now on the App Store and ongoing talk of a Facebook phone project, Apple clearly must double down on its social strategy and improve upon iOS feature set.
* It would be nice, for starters, to have deep Facebook integration in iOS 6 so we could post photos to Facebook directly from the Photos or Camera app.
* I’m also keeping my fingers crossed for a major Photos overhaul. It’s seriously lacking in the editing department, offering only basic features to touch up your snaps.
* And don’t get me started on the messed up album management on the device, lack of per-image options for Photo Stream, the inability to take snaps at a lower resolution and so forth.
* There’s really no excuse to leave out those simple yet sought-after features.
* What’s your wish list for the Camera and Photos apps in iOS 6?
