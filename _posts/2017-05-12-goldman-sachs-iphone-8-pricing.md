* Simona Jankowski, an analyst with the multinational finance company Goldman Sachs, predicted that Appe’s OLED-based iPhone 8 could cost $999 for a 128-gigabyte model, or $1,099 for the top-of-the-line model with 256 gigabytes of storage.
* “We think the higher demand for the larger 5.8-inch form factor will be supported by the fact that iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors,” like a 5.8-inch OLED display and 3D-sensing augmented reality technology, reads the note.
* She told her clients in a note seen by Business Insider that the entry-level models of iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus may be priced at $649 and $769, respectively, like the current iPhone 7 models. The flagship 256GB iPhone 7 Plus model currently retails for $969.
* “We expect iPhone 8 to have 128 GB and 256 GB models priced at $999 and $1,099, respectively,” Jankowski and her team wrote in the note to clients. She doesn’t think Apple will offer iPhone 8 with just 32 gigabytes of storage.
* Here’s an excerpt from the research note:
* Relative to the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus, we estimate the new features and higher commodity prices to increase the bill of materials by over $70, which we expect Apple to offset via a $130 price increase, resulting in a starting price of $999 for the 128GB capacity and $1,099 for the 256GB capacity.
* The first $1,000 iPhone can drive “meaningful upside,” reads the note.
* Goldman Sachs expects these features and costs:
* She believes Apple has now finalized iPhone 8’s design.
* “Apple usually explores multiple designs in parallel,” explains her note. “However, with only four months left until launch, we believe Apple has now locked down the design.”

* She estimates fiscal 2018 iPhone average selling prices will rise sixteen percent annually to $763 versus the $675 Wall Street consensus.
* Due to the expected higher-priced iPhone 8 models, Goldman Sachs has raised its estimates further above consensus, setting its Apple price target to $170 from $164, representing ten percent upside from Thursday’s close, and raising its Apple fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share forecast to $11.50 from $11.00 versus the Wall Street average of $10.40.
* Fast Company was first to report back in February that the flagship iPhone 8 model could cost north of $1,000 due to advanced technologies and premium parts.
