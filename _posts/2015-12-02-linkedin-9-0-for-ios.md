* LinkedIn, the leading business-oriented social networking service, today released a major update to its iPhone, iPod touch and iPad application in the App Store. Featuring a brand new interface redesigned from the ground up, the app is now streamlined into five core areas: Your Feed, Me, My Network, Messaging and Search.
* In addition, owners of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus can press firmly LinkedIn’s Home screen icon for Search, New Message, View Activity and Share features.
* “We’ve not only rebuilt the new Flagship app from scratch but we have taken everything you love and more to develop a mobile experience that is more intuitive, smarter and dramatically simplifies your LinkedIn experience,” writes the company.
* The app can now be enabled in iOS 9’s Spotlight Search so you can find your connections by pulling down on any Home screen to bring up Spotlight’s search field.

* As mentioned, the redesigned LinkedIn experience revolves around five core areas of the service: Your Feed, Me, My Network, Messaging and Search.
* Your Feed (Home)—This is content from your network, based on what LinkedIn determined is most relevant for your industry, function and skills combined with what conversations and content you care about. “For the first time, as part of a lightweight on boarding process, we are going to ask you what content you are interested in, and over time you can also unfollow things that are less valuable to you,” said the firm.
* Me—All things about you, such as who’s viewed your profile, who is commenting on, or sharing your posts and more. You can also update your profile in the Me section.
* My Network—Your daily briefing of what’s happening in your professional network, including people you may know, new posts from your network and suggestions to keep connected. If you sync your calendar with LinkedIn, My Network will prompt you to check out the profile of the person you are meeting with, with details on what shared connections or shared interests you have.
* Messaging—Your light-weight messaging interface on LinkedIn.
* Search—Now up to 300 percent faster, LinkedIn’s Search helps you find people, jobs and groups, with auto-suggestions popping up as you’re typing.
* Last but not least, LinkedIn debuted a brand new app launcher feature allowing you to launch into other LinkedIn apps, like Pulse, Groups, Job Search and more.
* LinkedIn requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOs 8.0 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Arabic, Bokmål, Norwegian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional, Chinese and Turkish.
* Grab LinkedIn free of charge in the App Store.
