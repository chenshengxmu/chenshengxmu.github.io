* The number one contactless payment service in the mobile world, Apple Pay, will be implementing person to person payments starting with iOS 11. What the rumor mill had treated for the longest time as Apple Cash is now going to be located in your redesigned iMessage app drawer, and serve as an easy way to send money to any friend or family member on Apple’s iMessage service.
* Money transferred via iMessage winds up in the recipient’s Wallet app in the shape of a brand new card called Apple Pay Cash card. From there, the card can be thought of as a multi purpose account, facilitating purchases on the App Store, storing the money for future transactions, but also offering the handy option to withdraw the money to your private bank account. As expected, Touch ID authentication is required to go ahead with any one transaction.
