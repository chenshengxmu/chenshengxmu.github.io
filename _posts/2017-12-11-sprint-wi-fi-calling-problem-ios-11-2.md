* Many Sprint customers are unable to use the Wi-Fi Calling feature after updating their iPhone to iOS 11.2, which released publicly on December 2, and carrier settings version 31.0.
* The affected users took to Twitter, Reddit, Sprint and Apple Support Communities to report this issue, which apparently manifests itself on older devices, too, including the iPhone 6 series.
* “Sprint Wi-Fi Calling has worked for almost whole year, but since last weekend’s iOS 11.2 iOS update it stopped working,” one poster said. “I can attest to this as well,” wrote another. “Prior to iOS 11.2/Carrier 31.0 my phone would switch to Sprint Wi-Fi Calling within seconds of it connecting to my router. After the latest update it takes hours, and in some cases not at all.”
* The more likely scenario is that there might be a conflict between the carrier profile and iOS 11.2 that is impacting the functionality of Wi-Fi Calling for Sprint customers though that’s speculation on my part.
* Reseting network settings, restarting a router or restoring a device as new doesn’t solve the problem. It’s possible that carrier settings version 31.0 are causing Wi-Fi Calling issues for Sprint customers. On the other hand, this could be an iOS 11.2 issue because some folks who have downgraded to iOS 11.1.2 are reporting being able to use Wi-Fi Calling again.
* More realistically, however, this is a problem on the network end.
* According to last week’s post by a Sprint representative, they are aware of the problem. The carrier has tested a temporary patch in one of its Wi-Fi Calling servers. If that test went well, they planned to roll it out to more servers until a permanent fix is made available.
* Any of you Sprint customers out there who are seeing this issue please share your experience with other customers by leaving a comment down below.
