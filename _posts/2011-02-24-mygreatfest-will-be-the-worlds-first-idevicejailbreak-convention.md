* MyGreatFest is going to be the world’s first jailbreak and iCommunity convention. The event will take place on September 17, 2011 in London, UK.
* The conference is still being organized, but the MyGreatFest team promises that their convention will be an educational and fun experience for any iDevice user. They already have the one and only Jay “saurik” Freeman confirmed as a keynote speaker for the convention (he invented jailbreaking). So, we know they mean business.
* The MyGreatFest team explains their event,
* “The MyGreatFest event is set to be the worlds first iCommunity and Jailbreak convention ever held and is the brought to you by the founder, Craig Fox, aka @flawlessfox.  Craig has assembled a dedicated, knowledgeable team from all walks of life who all share the same passion and love of their iDevice(s).
* The cynic in you might be thinking, “So this is just a bunch of tech geeks getting together to look at their beloved iPhones”.  Well rest assured, it’s not.  MyGreatFest will teach you how to use your devices and how to get the best out of your iPhone, iPad and iPod touches. The MyGreatFest experience is proudly associated with the thriving iCommunity and will educate users on how to most efficiently use your device whether it be through Jailbreaking or App Usage.
* The team at MyGreatFest have been working extremely hard since the creation of this event to make sure that no stone is left unturned and no idea is left out in the cold.  The ‘Behind the Scenes’ work has involved collecting information about possible venues and locations, travel and accommodation for those attending, competitions and give-aways and unique MyGreatFest merchandise, plus much much more.  You can be certain that we are working relentlessly to ensure that we provide the best, feature rich event for the community we hold so dear.
* If you are an active member of this community, or even if you are an outside voyeur looking in you will undoubtedly recognize some of the big community names we have on board – ranging from developers, well known technical support gurus and the producers of the highest quality themes.”
* Sound interesting? Here’s a video from the MyGreatFest team:

* The venue will be at The Old Truman Brewery on Brick Lane in London. It looks like an awesome place for a geek meet-up.
* While general iDevice stuff will be covered at the convention, jailbreaking appears to be a huge focus for MyGreatFest. The MyGreatFest team has a page on their website that explains why each of the team members jailbreak their iPhones, as well as a nice history of jailbreaking and an explanation of what it means to jailbreak.
* Tickets have also been made available for purchase. Pricing is as follows: Adult: £27, Child (in case you want saurik to sign your baby’s forehead): £17, Family (1 child & 1 adult) £58, and Group of Adults (4 adults) £98.50.
* Check the MyGreatFest website for more info on ticket purchases and travel information.
* The saddest thing about MyGreatFest is that, for those of us in the United States, it’s kind of difficult to just jump across the pond for a conference in the U.K.
* We here at iDB aren’t sure what our involvement (if any) will be with the conference, but there is a slight possibility that Sebastien might be able to attend.
* We’ll be sure to keep you updated about the MyGreatFest convention. It sounds like the perfect convention for the iDB audience. What do you think? If you live in Europe, would you consider attending MyGreatFest? (You could have the opportunity to meet saurik!)
