* Apple has released iOS 4.3.4 for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. This update is now available in iTunes and has been released to fix the PDF exploit uncovered and distributed by Comex in the latest addition of JailbreakMe.
* iOS 4.3.4 can be applied to your iDevice by updating your software in iTunes.
* We obviously warn you to not update to 4.3.4 if you are on a jailbroken device. JailbreakMe users will need to stay on 4.3.3 to maintain their untethered jailbreak.
* We’ll let you know anything else we hear about 4.3.4, but for right now, stay away if you’re jailbroken. Now would also be a very good time to backup your SHSH blobs in the event that you need to downgrade.
* iOS 4.2.9 for the Verizon iPhone has also been released.
* This is how Apple describes the update:
* “Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
* Description: A buffer overflow exists in FreeType’s handling of TrueType fonts. Viewing a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.”

* UPDATE: The Dev Team has released a tethered RedSn0w jailbreak for iOS 4.3.4. For more information, go here.
