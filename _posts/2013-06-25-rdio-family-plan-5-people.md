* The popular Internet-based radio service, Rdio, today announced it has refreshed its subscription plans for families to allow up to five people on a single plan. Previously, only three people on a family plan were allowed to use the service. The online radio service has also amended its pricing to reflect these changes, offering a $17 saving for a family of five compared to individual plans…
* Rdio explains in a blog post that a main account holder simply adds sub-accounts to his or her subscription. This allows each family member to have their own Rdio Unlimited account.
* Individual sub-accounts can build their own Collection, playlists, network of followers and more, without having to share their personalized settings with other sub-accounts.
* Here are the new tiers:
* • Two accounts cost $17.99 per month • Three accounts cost $22.99 per month • Four members cost $27.99 per month • Five members cost $32.99 per month
* If you’re a paid Rdio customer (I use Spotify in conjunction with iTunes Radio), these prices should pique your interest – not just for the savings, but because it’s much more convenient for your family to use a single shared plan.
* Do you stream your music via Rdio?
