title: iOS 6 Beta 3 finally lets you download free apps without Apple ID

* We received several tips this past weekend that the latest iOS 6 Beta 3 which was released to Apple’s registered developers last week finally does away with Apple ID requirement for free apps. Normally, when you download a free app from the App Store, Apple requires you to enter your existing Apple ID or create a new account.
* This never made any sense to ordinary users: I can’t tell you how many times my friends (some of whom only download free stuff) asked me if there was a way to drop that pesky requirement. It also doesn’t support Apple’s ‘cut the cord’ initiative that lets one set up and use an iOS device without a computer and iTunes…
* This change follows in footsteps of the first iOS 6 Beta which dropped Apple ID requirement for app re-downloads.
* Another reason to like this: you’re no longer required to entrust Apple with your credit card information just to download free apps.
* You’d be surprise how many people find the very thought resenting and it’s especially true for technically inept users who cannot fathom why getting free stuff requires their credit card information.
* It’s understandable that Apple wants to have as many credit cards on file as possible, but a line needs to be drawn somewhere and I’m glad the company addressed concerns and dropped this stupid requirement from iOS 6 Beta 3.
* Besides, it’s better from the usability perspective as I can just tap the download button and get some free software, bypassing that pesky Apple ID login alert.
* Was this ever an issue for you?
