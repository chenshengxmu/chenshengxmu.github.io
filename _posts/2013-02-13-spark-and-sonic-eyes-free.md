* Last summer, during its WWDC keynote, Apple announced that it was going to be taking its digital assistant act on the road. It introduced Siri ‘Eyes Free,’ a feature that allows qualified iPhone users to interact with Siri over Bluetooth using stock vehicle controls.
* A total of 9 major automakers have pledged support for the hands-free system including Audi, BMW, Toyota, Honda, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, and Jaguar. And today, it makes its official debut in Chevrolet’s youth-oriented Spark and Sonic vehicles…
* As noted by Forbes, all Chevy Spark and Sonic models with the MyLink infotainment system will now be outfitted with Siri Eyes Free. Drivers will be able to access the feature via a steering wheel-mounted button that will come factory installed in both cars.
* (It’s also worth noting that Chevy has said that existing 2013 Spark and Sonic owners will be able to upgrade existing MyLink systems to accommodate the digital voice assistant beginning in March)
* Using Eyes Free, and a compatible iPhone running iOS 6, drivers can use voice commands to perform a number of functions including placing hands-free phone calls, playing songs from their iTunes libraries, and listening to and composing SMS and iMessages.
* If your next vehicle’s not going to fall in Chevy’s lot, don’t worry. Honda announced last month that it will start offering Siri support in its 2013 Accord and Acura vehicles. And Hyundai has also said this year that it has Eyes Free-equipped models on the way.
* What do you think of Siri Eyes Free? Cool feature, or useless gimmick?
