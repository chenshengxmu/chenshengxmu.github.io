* Last month, word got out that a number of high-profile companies were in possible acquisition talks with the mysterious home automation startup R2 Studios. This included the likes of Microsoft, Google, and yes, even Apple.
* Well it looks like Microsoft won the day, as a new report this evening claims that the Redmond company will be the one purchasing the popular startup to help beef up its Xbox unit and increase its living room presence…
* The Wall Street Journal, who originally broke the story, reports:
* “Microsoft Corp. MSFT +3.41% has acquired a small home-entertainment technology startup to beef up its Xbox unit, according to people familiar with the matter.
* The company, id8 Group R2 Studios Inc., was created by entrepreneur Blake Krikorian in May 2011. Mr. Krikorian will be joining the Redmond, Wash., software giant with a small team. As part of the deal, Microsoft also acquired some patents owned by the startup related to controlling electronic devices.
* The price of the deal couldn’t be learned.”
* The company, known as R2 Studios, isn’t known for much outside of its Crestron-controller Android app, R2, but the report says that it has been working on technology related to distributing and displaying digital media on TVs.
* Given that information, it’s easy to see why the startup became a hot topic all of a sudden. And although it’s disappointing to see that Apple isn’t going to get to use the tech to beef up its TV offerings, Microsoft’s move makes sense.
* The Windows-maker has been spending the last few years morphing its Xbox 360 into much more than a video game console. The 8 year-old system now acts as a digital hub for your living room, offering digital downloads and live TV.
* There’s a few takeaways here, but the most applicable one for me is this: The Journal reiterates today that Apple met with R2 Studios to discuss a buyout. At this point, I don’t see how you could think that there’s not at least a little truth to the TV rumors.
