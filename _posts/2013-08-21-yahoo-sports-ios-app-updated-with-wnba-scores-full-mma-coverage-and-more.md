* Yahoo back in May updated its popular Fantasy Football iOS client with mobile drafting and a slew of other new features and improvements to get you ready for the start of the 2013 NFL season. But if American football just isn’t your thing, how about basketball? Or mixed martial arts? Or some other sport?
* Don’t worry, Yahoo’s Sports iOS client (previously known as Sportacular) has you covered. In a new updated issued today, Yahoo has overhauled the software while adding the full MMA coverage, a range of scores, news and standings for the WNBA and more…
* In addition to MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) coverage and WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association) scores, news and standings, Yahoo Sports versions 4.1 adds L10 to MLB standings, improves external article rendering and makes the football field view prettier on the iPad.
* Oh, and they added scoring summary back to football game details and fixed startup freeze caused by time zone settings.

* Here’s your blurb:
* Yahoo! Sports is designed to be incredibly fast while still providing the in-depth sports coverage every true fan needs. Easy access to scores, news and stats in a clean, simple layout. Get personalized live scores and information on your favorite teams, player, and leagues.
* By the way, Yahoo should really remove the exclamation mark from its name.
