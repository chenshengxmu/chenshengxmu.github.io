* Are you a frequent Amazon shopper and a heavy Twitter user? If so, you’ll be delighted to know that you can now add products to your shopping basket without ever leaving Twitter. It couldn’t be easier: simply find a tweet containing an Amazon product link, reply with #AmazonCart and voilà – the product in question gets quickly saved in your Amazon shopping basket.
* You can add as many products as you want this way before checking out at your convenience later. #AmazonCart is currently available in the United States and in the United Kingdom, where it’s called #AmazonBasket…
* Replying with the hashtag will produce a reply tweet from @MyAmazon describing the status of your request. Note you must first connect your Twitter account to Amazon before you can start replying with #AmazonCart to any tweet containing an Amazon product link.
* Don’t worry, you can easily opt out of the service by editing your connection preferences at the Social Settings page here.
* The promo video below gives a nice overview of #AmazonCart.

* It’s worth underscoring that replying with #AmazonCart only saves the item to your Amazon shopping cart. To buy any saved item(s), you must check out at a later time.
* But what about your privacy?
* According to Amazon, as most content is public on Twitter, “your #AmazonCart replies will be visible to whomever you replied, to those viewing the conversation, and on your own Timeline,” – unless, of course, your Twitter account is set to private.
