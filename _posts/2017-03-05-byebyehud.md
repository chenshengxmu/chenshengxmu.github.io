* The volume HUD continues to lack any innovation from Apple with each passing release of iOS. It’s put smack in the middle of the screen, overlaying everything and making watching videos or playing games more of an annoyance than anything.
* There has been a truck load of jailbreak tweaks released in the past that aimed to fix this issue by relocating the volume HUD to the top of the screen, and a new free release called ByeByeHUD by midkin joins that ever-expanding list.
* Once installed, ByeByeHUD essentially relocates the volume HUD to the top of the screen, just like many jailbreak tweaks before it. Here, it’s out of the way and doesn’t hinder your access to the screen to watch videos and/or play games.
* ByeByeHUD includes many themes you can pick from, which is a feature normally only seen in paid releases:

* In order from left to right in the screenshot examples above, you can see:
* For minimalists, the first view (minimal) is the way to go, and in my opinion, is the best-looking option out of all three. I’m also keen on the slider view, which maintains a relatively clean look and feel.
* The bar view styling looks similar to that of a jailbreak tweak called SmartVolumeControl, which the developer actually credits in the Cydia depiction. ByeByeHUD is considered a “lite” version of this paid tweak.
* To change the tweak to match your personal tastes, ByeByeHUD puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand, as well as pick and choose the theme you wish to use:

* If you’re interested in trying ByeByeHUD, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
