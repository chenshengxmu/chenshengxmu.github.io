* The Apple Watch App Store is basically the normal App Store with an Apple Watch spin. Apple Watch app screenshots and icons are prominently displayed, with iPhone screenshots being displayed underneath. It’s basically the reverse of the standard App Store.

* Since there are no standalone Apple Watch apps, all of the apps downloaded from the Apple Watch App Store are iPhone apps with Apple Watch support. Hence, if you’ve already purchased a particular iPhone app, that app will be available for download free of charge.
* The Apple Watch App Store is a way for people to easily discover apps that feature Apple Watch apps; It filters out any app that doesn’t. Again, the Apple Watch App Store is accessible via the Apple Watch app on devices running iOS 8.2 or iOS 8.3.
