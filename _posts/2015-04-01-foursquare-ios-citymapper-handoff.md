* Foursquare, the world’s top crowd-sourced local search and discovery service and mobile app, has pushed a refresh to its iPhone and iPad places-discovery application available at no cost in the App Store.
* Among other new features, Foursquar 8.1 enables Handoff support between iOS and the Mac and lets you easily access Citymapper from the app. For those wondering, Citymapper is a fast-growing, real-time transit service available on the iPhone and coming to the Apple Watch next month.
* With Handoff support in place in Foursquare 8.1 for iOS, you can now start exploring a place on your iPhone and continue right where you left off in Foursquare for iPad, just by dragging the Foursquare icon on the Lock screen upward.
* Moreover, Handoff support extends the Foursquare experience to your Mac, by letting you open a place from the iOS app in a browser on your Mac.
* As mentioned before, Citymapper is now available in Foursquare, bringing directions to the spot you just discovered to the iPhone and iPad app. In addition to Handoff and Citymapper support, Foursquare 8.1 includes the usual assortment of speed improvements and bug fixes.
* Check-ins, along with a bunch of gamefied features, have been removed from the main Foursquare app, which now serves as a place-discovery engine. To check in to places, write reviews and collect mayorships, use Foursquare’s new app called Swarm, available free in the App Store.
* Download Foursquare free in the App Store.
