* As Apple continues testing iOS 11 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch ahead of its scheduled fall release, the Cupertino technology giant today seeded a fifth beta of the upcoming software update to the registered developers and members of the Apple Developer Program.
* A matching public beta will likely drop within the next 24 hours.
* If you’re a developer whose device already runs a previous beta of iOS 11, you can upgrade to iOS 11 beta 5 (build number 15A5341f) over the air using the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app.
* A configuration profile provided on Apple’s Dev Center must be installed on the device.
* Here’s Andrew’s hands-on walkthrough of the changes in the previous beta.
