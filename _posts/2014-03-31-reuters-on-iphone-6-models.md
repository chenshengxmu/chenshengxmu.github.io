* Production on screens for the 4.7-inch version of Apple’s next iPhone could start as early as May, according to a new report from Reuters. Citing supply chain sources, the outlet says that Japan Display and other manufacturers are readying their facilities and could begin churning out panels next month.
* Unfortunately, for those looking forward to the oft-rumored 5.5-inch model, it sounds like production issues have forced Apple to delay the handset. Reuters says that manufacturers are running into difficulties with in-cell technology, and the larger displays may not go into production for several months…
* Here’s Reuters’ Reiji Murai with more:
* “Apple Inc suppliers will begin mass producing displays as early as May for the next iPhone, expected to be launched this autumn, with a 4.7-inch screen likely to be produced first while a 5.5-inch version could be delayed, supply chain sources said. […]
* Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology – built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films – that was introduced with the iPhone 5, the sources said.
* But due to difficulties with in-cell production technology for the larger 5.5-inch size, one of the sources said, a decision was made to begin mass production with the 4.7-inch version alone. 
* The outlet reaffirms that Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd have all been tapped to make the screens—something we’ve heard in a number of reports. Japan Display will be the first to start production, at its main plant in Mobara, in May, with the others ramping up in June.

* Last week, Japan’s reliable Nikkei news outlet reported that Apple would be launching both 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone models in September. It also named the above 3 suppliers as next-gen display manufactures, and noted that the panels would be of higher resolution than Apple’s current-gen handsets.
