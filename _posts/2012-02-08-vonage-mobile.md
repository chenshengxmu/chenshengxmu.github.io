* Vonage has come out fighting in its ongoing battle with the king of VoIP, Skype. The company has just released a new iOS app along with a low calling rate that is sure to put the frighteners on Skype.
* Available to download for free right now, the Vonage app allows VoIP calls between Vonage users across iOS and Android as well as cheap calls to traditional landlines, too.
* Vonage claims to be 70% cheaper than traditional telcos, and 30% cheaper than Skype…
* Users of the app can add credit to their Vonage account right on their iOS device, be that iPad, iPod touch or iPhone, using the wonders of the in-app purchase system. Apple will no doubt be taking its 30% cut of that, too.
* “In addition, when calling those who don’t have the app, you get ultra low-cost international calling with per-minute rates that are on average 70% less than major mobile carriers and 30% less than Skype **. Add calling credit directly from your iTunes account.”
* The free app currently also offers free calls to landlines in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico from anywhere in the world. This is apparently a limited time deal though, so if you’re going to call your Auntie Mavis over the border, then now is the time to do it!
* This is just another example of carriers being squeezed out by internet-based alternatives to their core businesses. It’s adapt or die time folks.
