title: Hands-on with Kamera
---
* Last week we brought you some information on Kamera — a recently released jailbreak tweak available for free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. Well, we just got a chance to try it out on…ahem, camera, so we thought we’d bring you a video walkthrough.
* As you probably remember, Kamera is a Notification Center widget that enables you to go directly to the front-facing or rear-facing mode via the Camera app. Recently an option was added to Kamera to allow you to use a long tap and hold to go straight to video mode. I’ve found it to be a decent tweak, although many other options exist out there to quickly invoke the Camera.
* If you’re browsing from an iDevice, you can download Kamera from Cydia using this direct link. Be sure to let us know what you think in the comments.
