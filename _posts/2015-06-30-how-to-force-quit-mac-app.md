* If you run macOS, you’re going to run into issues when a misbehaving app like Safari eats up system resources while refusing to quit the normal way. On iOS, it’s easy to force-quit any app iPhone or iPad app, and watchOS also provides a similar shortcut for purging an unresponsive task from its memory.
* As it turns out, you can also force-quit any Mac app just as easily. Please take a minute to check out Apple’s easy to remember shortcuts for force-quitting apps. They’ll come in handy when an app starts to slow your system to a crawl or gets wacky to the point when force-quitting is the only remaining option left.
* In this post, I’m going to teach you two methods of force-quitting a Mac app.
* If an app isn’t responding, or is unresponsive or has monopolized system resources, you can force it to close using macOS’ Force Quit command. Force-quitting an app removes it from memory and macOS will try to purge any claimed resources, if possible.
* As a result, your Mac and apps will perform and multitask more smoothly.
* Step 1: Locate the unresponsive app in the Dock and right click on its icon.

* Step 2: A contextual menu will open. Press and hold the Option key. The word Quit will change to Force Quit. Choose Force Quit to close the app.
* Step 1: Choose the Force Quit option in the Finder’s Apple menu.

* Step 2: Select the unresponsive app in the Force Quit window, then click Force Quit.
* Step 1: Press Option (⌥)-Command (⌘)-Esc on the keyboard to bring up the Force Quit window. This is similar to pressing Control-Alt-Delete on a PC.

* Step 2: Select the offending app in the Force Quit window and click the blue Force Quit button to end the process.
* Tip: If the app quit, you can reopen it by clicking Reopen in the dialog that appears.
* In case you were wondering, you may lose any unsaved changes after force-quitting an app. “Generally, you shouldn’t need to use Force Quit unless you can’t close an app normally,” cautions Apple.
* If the app freezes upon reopening—and force-quitting won’t do any god—there are several additional things worth trying out that may help rectify the situation.
* Restart your Mac
* Sometimes force-quitting the misbehaving app wouldn’t release system resources it’s claimed to itself.
* RTFW
* Yes, read the bloody documentation that came with your app to see if it’s compatible with your version of OS X or if there are any known issues you should know about.
* Open another file
* The file you’re trying to open may be causing the app to break. If there’s indeed a problem with the original file, try opening another one.
* Check your Mac for updates
* Choose App Store from the Finder’s Mac menu to open the Mac App Store. Now hit the Updates tab to see if there are any crucial updates available for OS X or your apps. If the misbehaving app was obtained outside the Mac App Store, visit its developer’s website to see if there are any updates available.
* Disconnect peripheral devices
* You may have just connected a peripheral device like a printer, a USB thumb drive or external storage that may not be compatible with your version of OS X.
* Double-check your plug-ins
* Some apps install kernel extensions that may cause the system or the app to misbehave. Other apps may install plug-ins or other enhancements. If all else fails, try disabling/uninstalling any plug-ins or extensions one by one until the app starts working again. This is especially true if you have recently updated the app or OS X as your existing plug-ins or extensions may no longer be compatible.
* Run Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test
* These tools let you see if there’s a problem with your Mac’s memory, storage or other hardware features.
* Restart your Mac in safe mode
* It may help so why not give it a shot?
