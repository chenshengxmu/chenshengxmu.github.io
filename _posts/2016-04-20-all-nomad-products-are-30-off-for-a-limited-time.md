* Our friends at Nomad just let us know they are running a pretty big sale for the next 72 hours, offering 30% their entire line up of products. This, coupled with free shipping in the US, makes it feel like Christmas is eight months early this year.
* For many, Nomad is synonymous of high quality products, usually serving the needs of Apple users with their simple and clever accessories. With high quality usually come higher prices, and Nomad is no exception, which is why this flash sale is even more appealing right now.
* To take advantage of this special offer, visit Nomad’s website, add products to your basket, and use coupon code SPACE30 at checkout.
* If you’re not familiar with Nomad, let me introduce you to a few of their products, which I think are well worth it.

* Our YouTuber in Chief Andrew O’Hara actually just reviewed this band last week and gave it raving praises. Made of Italian calfskin leather, Strap is an absolutely gorgeous band, now at the very affordable price of $105.

* I reviewed Stand when it first came out and this is still one of my two favorite Apple Watch charging docks. As a matter of fact, it is still sitting on one side of my bed. Now available at $35.

* Recently reviewed by both Anthony and Andrew, the Pod Pro is the one and only portable charger you will need for both your iPhone and Apple Watch as it can deliver two full charges for each device. Now available for $56.

* The little brother to the aforementioned Pod Pro, Pod is a portable battery pack for Apple Watch (no Lightning cable to charge your iPhone on this one). Packing 1800mAh, it should easily refill your Apple Watch twice while on the go. Grab it for $42.
* There are a few more very clever products coming from the guys at Nomad. Wallet for example, a premium leather wallet hiding a 2400mAh charger for iPhone. NomadPlus is also worth a look. It really soups up your iPhone charger for on-the-go convenience. If you don’t know about this one, you should really check it out, as well as the handful of other products available on Nomad’s website.
* Note that to take advantage of the 30% discount, you will have to enter coupon code SPACE30 during checkout.
* And remember, this sale is running until tonight midnight, so make sure you get on it now!
