* Joining Walmart and other retailers looking to get a head start on next week’s Black Friday festivities, Best Buy today began offering limited-time deals on a number of products. Among those products is a first generation iPad Air, and fifth-gen iPod touch, both of which have been significantly discounted.
* For the next three days, Best Buy is taking between $80 and $100 off all iPad Air models—the discount depends on the model you buy. While the original Air is more than a year old now, it still features a newer hardware design and packs plenty of power. The 16GB Wi-Fi-only model is a steal at just $319.
* As for the iPod touch, Best Buy has shaved $50 off the price of the 64GB 5th gen model, meaning you can get it for just $249. That’s more than you’ll pay for an entry-level iPad this holiday season, but if you or the person you’re buying the gift for has a large music collection, you’ll need the bigger hard drive.
* Rounding out the deals are Beats Solo HD On-Ear headphones, which have been discounted $70 and now cost just $99, and a couple of wireless speakers. iHome’s AirPlay speaker system is just $49.99 right now, normally $299.99, and the water-resistant Ultimate Ears Boom speaker is $20 off at $179.99.
* Best Buy says these deals are good through Saturday, when it will presumably place another group of items on sale. Actual Black Friday promotions begin on Thursday next week, and run through the weekend to Cyber Monday. For more Black Friday deals, click here, and stay tuned for our continuing coverage.
