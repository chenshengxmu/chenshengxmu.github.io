* Apple’s underappreciated Find My iPhone app (BTW, shouldn’t it be called ‘Find My iOS Device’ instead?) has seen some clever uses that went a long way toward retrieving stolen iPhones and iPads. But punk trombonist Nadav Nirenberg took it to the next level when he posed as a women in order to lure an unsuspecting thief who stole his iPhone into a trap. According to media reports, holding a hammer in his hand, Nadav was patiently awaiting for the thief to arrive at his apartment to arrange an exchange…
* Last Friday, New York Post reported how the 27-year-old used a phony online dating profile to trick the iPhone thief. He apparently learned that someone had been using the phone to send messages to girls.
* He then used the same dating site to message the crook and arouse his interest.
* As explained on Nadav’s blog, the thief replied back to confirm he wanted to meet at “her” place that night.
* The bandit knocked on his door at around 7 p.m. holding a bottle of wine. He was clean-shaven and smelled like cologne.
* “He was ready for a date,” Nirenberg said.
* But instead of a kiss, the musician tapped him on the shoulder from behind, flashed a hammer and demanded his phone back.
* The crook, who was short and soft-spoken, nervously handed over the cellphone and bolted after Nirenberg handed him $20.
* It all took less than 20 seconds.
* “As he was walking away, I said, ‘You smell great, though,’ ” Nirenberg quipped.
* He didn’t even file a police report because “he didn’t want trouble”.
* If something like this happened to me, I would sue the crook’s ass off.
