* Great news for those of you with AT&T-branded LTE iPads. The carrier has just announced new markets and expansions for its long term evolution network.
* Folks in south Florida, parts of Maryland and Massachusetts will now be able to browse the web at lightning-fast 4G speeds. Keep reading for the full list of new areas…
* According to AT&T’s press page, LTE is now available in the following areas:
* The new areas push the number of AT&T’s LTE-compatible markets up close to 50. But it’s still no where near Verizon. Big Red’s most recent press release put its LTE network in upwards of 350 markets.
* AT&T, however, is still ahead of the other two major carriers in LTE coverage. Sprint, who just launched its next-generation network this month, is currently only in about 5 markets, and T-Mobile isn’t even in the game yet.
* We’ll continue to keep an eye on LTE availability, as its significance grows over the next few months. Apple is widely expected to a release a new smartphone this fall that’s compatible with the 4G technology.
