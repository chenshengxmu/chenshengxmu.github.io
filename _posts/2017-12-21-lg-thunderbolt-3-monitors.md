* Ahead of CES 2018, LG on Thursday pre-announced a trio of brand new external displays.
* There’s a regular 32-incher with 4K resolution, a QHD gaming monitor and a 34-inch UltraWide model with increased 5K resolution of 5,120-by-2160 pixels and a 21:9 aspect ratio.
* With Thunderbolt 3 I/O, these monitors can take advantage of a single-cable connection to a Mac that includes power, no charging adapter or unsightly USB cables required.
* The 34-incher (model 34WK95U), pictured top of post, is aimed at professional users who multitask extensively, such as video editors, photographers and software developers.
* With a 5K resolution of 5,120-by-2,160 pixels, this is LG’s very first 21:9 5K UltraWide monitor.
* Thunderbolt 3 connectivity lets it receive 5K resolution images at 60Hz with a single cable that transfers video, audio, data and power. The device has slim bezels on all four sides.
* LG’s new 32-inch monitor (model 32UK950) can display 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color spectrum, which is the same standard Apple uses for its wide color implementation. LG says this is comparable to monitors used to master Hollywood blockbusters.

* It sports the first Thunderbolt 3 docking display to support 4K daisy chaining, allowing a setup of dual 4K monitors. Again, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity allows a single cable to deliver 4K images and sound while providing enough charge to power a 60W notebook.
* Both models feature Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, making them compatible with the new MacBook Pro and iMac Pro computers. They also come with Nano IPS for accurate color reproduction that LG claims boasts the “intensity and purity” of colors.
* Nano IPS technology is similar to LG’s LED TV where nanometer-sized particles in the screen’s LED absorb excess light wavelengths. Lastly, the two monitors provide a higher dynamic range of peak brightness of 600 candela that meets VESA’s new DisplayHDR specification.

* The Korean company added that it will be soon unveiling its new QHD gaming monitor (model 34GK950G) with premium picture quality, Nano IPS and high-speed G-Sync technologies.
* LG will provide more information at CES in January 2018, including availability and pricing.
