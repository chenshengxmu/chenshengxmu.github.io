* Chair Entertainment’s Infinity Blade III is still on sale following the massive ‘Blade Masters’ update and now its predecessor, Infinity Blade II, has been slashed to zero bucks, courtesy of Apple’s ongoing Free App of the Week promotion (last week’s free app: Fun Golf GPS 3D).
* This means that you can download this elegiac masterpiece free of charge until next Thursday, after which it will go back up to its normal asking price of seven bucks.
* It’s a universal app so you can play it on both your iPhone and iPad. Again, this game is downright awesome so you’ll most certainly regret passing on this deal if you don’t act pronto. The triple-A iOS exclusive has been built on Epic Games’ Unreal engine and is the closest thing to a system-seller on Apple’s platform.
* Go grab Infinity Blade II in the App Store now!
* Released in November 2011, Infinity Blade II has gone temporarily free just once, last summer as part of the App Store’s fifth anniversary celebration.
* Infinity Blade 2 is the free App of the Week on @AppStore. Get it now! http://t.co/4ESndigegv
