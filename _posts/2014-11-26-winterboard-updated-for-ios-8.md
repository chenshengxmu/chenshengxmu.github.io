* Themers rejoice as WinterBoard has been updated to support new features of iOS 8. Clocking at version 0.9.3916, this new version of WinterBoard adds a few features geared towards iOS 8, as well as some features for users that are still on iOS 7.
* Besides the many updates that can be found under the hood, the most obvious change users will notice right away is that WinterBoard isnâ€™t a standalone app anymore, and all changes will have to be made directly from the dedicated panel in the Settings app.
* Here is the complete changelog from WInterBoard 0.9.3916:
* 8.x: Support @3x Image Hunting
* 7.x: Theme .car File PNGs (coolstar)
* 7.x: Preferences Icons (JunesiPhone)
* 6.x: Better SharedArtwork Hook
* Better Resource Pathing (Surenix)
* New @3x WinterBoard Icon (Surenix)
* Fix Crash in Bundle Theme Cache
* Remove Standalone Application
* Image Recorder Now Uses Bundles
* While some themes might still work in their current state, most of them will need to be updated to fully word properly.
* What themes are you most looking forward to?
