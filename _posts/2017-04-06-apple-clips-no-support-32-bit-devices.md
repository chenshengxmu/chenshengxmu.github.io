* Has Clips, Apple’s new video editing app, piqued your interest? If so, good luck downloading it on your iPhone 5/5c or iPad 4. That’s because the free of charge video creation app lacks support for 32-bit iOS devices despite requiring the recently-released iOS 10.3, which in itself runs on 32-bit iOS devices.
* As first noted by AppleInsider, this could be interpreted as another sign that Apple will stop supporting 32-bit devices when iOS 11 releases later this year.
* “It is not exactly clear when Apple will completely drop support for 32-bit devices in the iOS itself,” writes the publication. “The omission of 32-bit device compatibility appears to be another step for the company in that direction.”
* In another sign that iOS 11 will make the end of the road for 32-bit apps and devices, Apple’s changed a warning about 32-bit apps on iOS 10.3. The reworded prompt now cautions users that using a 32-bit app will slow down their 64-bit device.

* “This app will not work with future version of iOS,” reads the reworded prompt on iOS 10.3. Moreover, iOS 10.3 includes a new App Compatibility section within the Settings app that names and shames all 32-bit apps that are installed on your device.

* The following iOS devices are 64-bit:
* Last but not least, iOS 10.3.1 has brought back the ability to update 32-bit iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices over the air though owners of iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 were always able to update their legacy hardware through iTunes. This is interesting in and of itself because the iOS 10.3.2 beta currently lacks 32-bit device support.
