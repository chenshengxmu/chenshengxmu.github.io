* SEGA has been known to put its iOS apps on sale every once in a while, and this weekend is one such occasion, with three of the Japanese company’s games having a couple of dollars slashed from their App Store price.
* The three available games have been around for a while, but if you’ve not picked them up yet, or have perhaps been on the fence about picking them up at their normal price, then now’s the time to bite the bullet and get the credit card out.
* So which games are included in the sale? Well, if you’re into some of SEGA’s classics, then you’re going to love the games Sega has included in its promotion…
* Gamers of a certain age will instantly recognise the franchises involved here, with three of SEGA’s most loved franchises putting in an appearance.
* The sale items are:
* We remember playing Crazy Taxi way back on the Dreamcast, so that particular game has a special place in our hearts. These iOS versions do obviously suffer from not being designed with a touch interface in mind, but hey, they’re certainly better than nothing!
* If any of the three games above are on your shopping list, be sure to pick them up before the prices go back up after this weekend!
* Will you be shopping in SEGA’s sale?
