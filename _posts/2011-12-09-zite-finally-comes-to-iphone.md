* If recent releases like Flipboard and Google Currents haven’t fulfilled your need for an iPhone news magazine app, you’ll be happy to hear that a new title has just surfaced in the App Store.
* Zite, which was chosen by Apple as the number one iPad news app of 2011, is now available on the iPhone. Although it’s similar in function to the aforementioned apps, its style is completely different…

* If you haven’t used the iPad version of Zite before, you’re probably wondering what it does. Here’s a brief explanation of the software from the App Store:
* “Zite is a free personalized magazine for iOS that automatically learns what you like and gets smarter every time you use it. Zite delivers all the great news, articles, blogs, and videos you want — and helps you discover new stuff that you’ll love.”
* When you first launch Zite for the iPhone, you are greeted with a login screen. Previous Zite users can log into their accounts to populate all of their saved settings, and others can enter in their Twitter and Read It Later information. The app uses this data to start populating stories into its news reader that it thinks you’ll find interesting.

* Zite’s user interface may not be as pretty as Flipboard’s, but it’s a lot easier to use. You can switch between news categories by swiping left or right, and selecting an article launches you into the app’s dedicated reader. You can even rate the stories with a thumbs up or thumbs down to help the app learn your preferences.
* Zite Personalized Magazine is a great alternative to other news magazines apps. If you want to check it out, it’s available in the App Store for free.
