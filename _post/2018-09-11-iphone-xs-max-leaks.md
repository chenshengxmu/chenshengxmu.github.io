* With one day to go before Apple’s big “Gather round” event, new details have emerged about the devices most likely to make an appearance tomorrow. The details come from 9to5Mac, which was the first outlet to publish real images purportedly of the upcoming iPhone Xs/Xs Max and fourth-generation Apple Watch. 
* On the iPhone front, 9to5Mac says the 6.5-inch iPhone Xs Max could weigh 7.34 ounces versus the iPhone 8 Plus which weighs 7.13 ounces. It attributes the stainless steel enclosure band on the new model for the difference. The iPhone 8 Plus has aluminum on the sides. The publication calls the design for the iPhone Xs Max “asymmetrical.”
* It has also heard that for the second year in a row, iPhones will include a 5W charging brick with USB-A in the box. On Monday, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported the same news which came from a separate source.
* 9to5Mac has also heard the iPhone Xs Max with dual SIM will have four holes on one side of the Lightning port and seven holes on the other side. This compares to six holes on either side on the iPhone X. There’s been no word on why the change was made.
* Finally, both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are expected to ship with separate space wallpapers, depending on the color of the device. Above, you can see the wallpaper that’s expected to ship with the new gold version; there will be ones matching the space gray and silver models.

* For the Apple Watch Series 4, 9to5Mac says it expects this year’s model to feature 64-bit processors, just like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. 32-bit software is no longer supported on iOS and won’t be on macOS after this year, so this piece of news makes sense. The current Apple Watch is 32-bit.
* This year’s Apple Watch is expected to feature a bigger display, all-new face, and more.
* As a reminder, Apple’s press event tomorrow begins at 10 a.m. PDT. We offer detailed instructions on how to watch the event live.
