* With the new iPhone launch less than a month away, retailers are scrambling to clear out some of their old stock. We’ve seen Apple’s handsets discounted at Target, Best Buy, and now, Walmart.
* The retail giant just announced that it too would be knocking down the price of its iPhones. As of today, it’s selling Sprint, AT&T and Verizon models of the 16GB iPhone 4S for just $148…
* 9to5Mac points to the announcement on Walmart’s Facebook page, which reads:
* “Amazing savings alert-starting on 8/23 at 9am local time, the iPhone 4S (16G) will drop to $148, down from $188!
* Select stores, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon customers, while supplies last, restrictions apply.”
* The restrictions it mentions are likely the usual: you have to either be a new customer, or be eligible for subsidy pricing on your account. And you must be cool with signing a 2-year contract.
* Of course, you’re probably better off waiting for another month or so. Even if you aren’t interested in the new iPhone, Apple has a history of discounting older products after unveiling new ones.
* But nevertheless, this is one of the better deals we’ve seen (except for Sprint) on what is still one of the best handsets available. So if you’re in the market for one right now, it’s worth checking out.
