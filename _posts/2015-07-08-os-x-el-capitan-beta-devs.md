* Apple on Wednesday released the third OS X El Capitan beta to developers. The new build is available to registered developers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store or through Apple’s Developer Center.
* Today’s update comes roughly two weeks after Apple pushed out the second beta of OS X El Capitan, and around a month after its initial release in early June during Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference.
* El Capitan does not include a ton of major new features, but instead builds on top of last year’s OS X Yosemite with a number of performance and stability improvements. There are a few user-facing changes, though, such as a new system-wide font and a revamped Mission Control with new Split Screen mode.
* We are installing today’s beta now, and will report back with any major changes. OS X El Capitan is currently only available to registered developers, but Apple has said that it will be releasing a public version of the beta in July, and of course the official release is expected this fall.
