* Although the design of these retro-looking AirPods is inspired by the Apple IIe computer, both the Apple IIe and the original Macintosh shared the same Pantone 453 matte finish. ColorWare also offers a bunch of other custom-painted gear, including gaming controllers, Beats headphones, MacBook Pro and PlayStation 4 skins and much more.
