* Telltale Games, the creator of the episodic Walking Dead game (itself based on the “The Walking Dead” comic book series by the Eisner Award-winning creator Robert Kirkman), has partnered with Skybound Entertainment and Zen Studios on a Walking Dead-themed pinball game for the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac.
* The game is available now as a standalone download in the App Store for $1.99.
* The Walking Dead Pinball offers a table based on the most iconic locations from the Game of the Year-winning series, including the St. John’s Dairy Farm, Travelier Motel, Bell Tower and Train & Level Crossing.
* 3D versions of the zombies and famous characters such as Lee and Clementine, along with the original lines and voice acting, round up this nicely done pinball game.
* To be perfectly clear, The Walking Dead Pinball is based on the first season of Walking Dead: The Game.
* Telltale has, of course, since released Walking Dead: The Game – Season 2. The five-chapter iPhone and iPad series is set to conclude with the final episode titled “No Going Back,” having hit the App Store this midnight.
* Check out The Walking Dead Pinball launch trailer below.
* Table features:
* The game is also releasing this week on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, Xbox One, Google Play Store, Amazon and Wii U.
* Download The Walking Dead Pinball for $1.99 in the App Store.
* The 42.4-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 5.0 or later. Again, this is a standalone game which only offers the Walking Dead-themed table.
* However, Zen Pinball for iOS [Free, Universal] and Zen Pinball 2 for Mac [Free] have been updated with an additional Walking Dead table, offered as an $1.99 In-App Purchase on iOS and $2.99 on the Mac.
