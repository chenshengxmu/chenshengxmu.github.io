* The iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 are now available for pre-order. Folks in participating launch countries can now place orders for the new devices on Apple’s website, the mobile Apple Store app, or via their wireless carrier.
* As we mentioned in our Pro Tips guide to pre-ordering, the easiest way to place your order is through the mobile app. Apple’s site tends to get bogged down with the influx of traffic, and carrier website health is hard to predict.
* Folks still trying to figure out what to purchase will find these posts and video roundups helpful:
* But don’t wait too long to make your decision. Just a few minutes after pre-orders opened, we noticed select iPhone models were already seeing longer shipping times—particularly the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black.
