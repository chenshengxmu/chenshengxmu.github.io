* Google has released an update for its iOS Gmail app that adds support for saving attachments directly to Google Drive and inserting Google Drive files directly into email messages.
* There are also new account management options for hiding accounts in the Gmail app without removing them altogether. Additionally, users can now change their profile picture in the app’s settings.
* In theory, this sounds similar to Apple’s implementation of Mail Drop in OS X Yosemite, which allows users to attach and email large files via iCloud Drive. According to Apple, Mac users would view the file in-line like any other attachment, while everyone else would receive a link to the file in iCloud Drive.
* Here’s the official change log for Gmail version 3.14159:
* The update should already be available on your device. You can download the official Gmail app in the App Store for free.
