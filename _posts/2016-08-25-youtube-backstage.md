* Just as we’re processing today’s news regarding an upcoming video-sharing app from Apple, a new report claims Google is set to enhance YouTube’s social experience in the fall by unveiling a new Backstage section in the mobile app and on the web.
* According to VentureBeat, Backstage will let YouTube users share not just videos, but also photos, polls, links, text posts and more with their subscribers.
* The firm is said to initially limit Backstage to a few popular YouTube accounts.
* Any posts shared to Backstage will also appear in subscribers’ feeds and notifications, potentially resulting in more clicks. In addition to YouTube clips, users will be permitted to share Backstage-only videos. Subscribers will be able to respond to posts with rich replies containing their own photos, videos and other types of comments.
* Just like Apple’s rumored video-sharing app, Backstage is thought to be YouTube’s response to the rising popularity of video sharing on competing social services such as Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter.
* Here’s an excerpt from the report:
* Backstage marks a pivotal shift for YouTube, whose sole focus on video and unsuccessful Google+ integration have left the door open for popular users to flock to competing services like Twitter and Facebook in order to better communicate with fans.
* By introducing new ways for users to converse, Backstage could reverse the historically one-way communication between stars and their fans. Video sharing and watching will remain the primary function of YouTube, but Backstage may help make YouTube a better place to talk about those videos, too.
* The feature should live alongside the Home and Videos tabs within individual YouTube channels. A Google spokesperson declined comment “on rumor or speculation.”
