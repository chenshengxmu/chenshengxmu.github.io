* If you have an iPhone, then chances are you have a credit card tied to your device in some way, shape, or form. Whether you’re using it for downloading apps with your Apple ID, linking it to use for NFC-based Apple Pay payments, or saving it to make payments through Safari with AutoFill, then you’ve got your credit card information stashed with Apple.
* Because credit card information is one of those things you probably try to keep safe from identity thieves and malware threats, it’s understandable that you might have a conscience about removing them from your tech. In this tutorial, we’ll show you three different ways to remove your credit card information from your iPhone.
* The first and most common place for a credit card to reside for use with your iPhone is in your Apple ID settings. This is the credit card that will be billed any time you buy apps, in-app purchases, movies, music, and more from Apple’s digital content stores.
* To remove a credit card that’s already been associated with your Apple ID, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app and go to iTunes & App Stores..
* 2) Tap on the Apple ID button.
* 3) In the pop-up menu, tap on the blue View Apple ID button.
* 4) Enter your password, or authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID to continue.
* 5) Now that you’re in the Account Settings page, tap on the Payment Information button.

* 6) If you see your credit card information here, tap on the None option under the Payment Type header.
* After selecting None, your existing credit card information will be erased from your Apple ID. You can confirm this by tapping on your old credit card vendor, and you’ll notice that you’ll have to re-enter all of your old credentials again.
* 7) Once satisfied, leave the setting to None and tap on the blue Done button at the top right of the app.
* After following these steps, you have successfully removed your credit card information from your Apple ID!

* To delete a credit card that’s associated with your iPhone for Apple Pay, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app from your Home screen.

* The other place a credit card might be residing on your iPhone is in your Safari settings, where you might have trained iOS to automatically fill out your personal data in web forms that require payment information to complete a purchase.
* To remove a credit card that’s associated with your iPhone’s Safari web browser, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app from your Home screen.
* 2) Open the Safari cell.
