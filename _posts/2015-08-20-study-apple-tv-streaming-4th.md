* The Apple TV fell to the spot of the fourth most popular streaming media device in the US last year, according to a newly-released study by Parks Associates. The research firm says that sales for Apple’s set-top box were eclipsed by those from Roku, Google and Amazon.
* “Roku continues to lead streaming media device sales in the U.S.,” said Barbara Kraus, the director of research at Parks Associates. Their data shows that Roku accounted for 34% of units sold in 2014, with Google in second at 23%, and Amazon overtaking Apple for third.

* Kraus also notes that the increase in competition is forcing innovation. “Devices with additional functionality such as the Intel Compute Stick may be a sign of things to come, where streaming is not the primary function but an extra feature to provide additional value.”
* It’ll certainly be interesting to see how Apple responds to the new landscape. Next month, the company is expected to unveil its first new set-top box in over three years, and it’s said to include advanced features such as voice control, a touchpad remote and native apps.
