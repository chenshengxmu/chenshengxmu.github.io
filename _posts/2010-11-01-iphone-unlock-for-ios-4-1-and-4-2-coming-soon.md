* Here is an interesting tweet from MuscleNerd saying that “a very nice unlock” is coming soon. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out the Dev Team already has an unlock ready for release but they’re just waiting for Apple to ship iOS 4.2, sometimes in the next few days.
* I assume this unlock will work for every device and will be compatible with iOS 4.1 and 4.2 basebands…
* That is some good news, especially for those who “accidentally” updated to iOS 4.1 and are now stuck out of their unlock.
* As always, the best way to keep your unlock safe is to not update your iPhone to the latest iOS right away, and to use PwnageTool once available to update while preserving the baseband.
* Any question about this? Feel free to ask in the comments section.
