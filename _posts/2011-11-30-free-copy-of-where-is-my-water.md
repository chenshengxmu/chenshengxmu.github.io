* Apple is feeling generous these days, so take advantage of it while it lasts. Just like it did not too long ago with Jetpack Joyride, Apple is currently giving away promo codes for another hit game, Where’s My Water, the Disney app that usually sells for $0.99 in the App Store.
* All you have to do is to go to Apple’s Facebook page, ‘like’ it, and get a promo code to redeem the app in the App Store…
* If you’re not sure how to do that, you can always check our tutorial on how to redeem promo codes in the App Store. Supplies are apparently limited, so hurry up!
* As usual, this is US only. Not our fault. It’s Apple’s rules.
