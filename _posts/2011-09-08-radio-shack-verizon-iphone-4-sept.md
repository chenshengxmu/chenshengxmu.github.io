* 9to5Mac is reporting that Radio Shack will start carrying the Verizon iPhone 4 in its retail stores on September 15, only a few weeks before Apple’s expected iPhone 5 announcement.
* Radio Shack has promised to sell Verizon handsets in September, but it’s odd that they would choose to kick it all off with the iPhone 4. Why not just wait until the next iPhone comes out? Do they know something we don’t?
* “Radio Shack will begin carrying the 16GB and 32GB (some locations) models (possibly only in black) of the Verizon iPhone 4 on September 15th, just a couple of weeks before the launch of the iPhone 5. Some Radio Shack locations will also get the Verizon iPad 2.”
* Like 9to5Mac, we agree that the timing is odd. What does this mean for the rumor of a cheaper, re-tooled iPhone 4? Will Apple sell the current iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 this Fall? Sounds far-fetched to us.
* What do you make of this news?
