* This one came out of a clear blue sky. Following negligible promotional activities, publisher Activision on Thursday unleashed a new Call of Duty game for the iPhone and iPad. Titled Call of Duty: Strike Team, it promises a brand new Call of Duty experience built from the ground up for mobile and tablet devices.
* The game combines both first and third-person action: you can dynamically switch from run-and-gun first-person view to reconnaissance and coordinated squad attacks in third-person view. The graphics look top-notch and you can fully customize your squad’s loadouts and abilities before leading them into combat. More tidbits right below…
* Check out the blurb:
* The year is 2020. Tensions run high amongst the world’s superpowers. In a surprise attack, the U.S. finds themselves in a war with an unknown enemy. Your mission is to lead a Joint Special Operations Team in a global effort to hunt down those responsible.
* It’s not the first Call of Duty game to adorn Apple’s platform: previously, Activision released Call of Duty: Zombies and Call of Duty: Black Ops on the App Store.
* Developed by the in-house studio called The Blast Furnace, Strike Team lets you switch between first and third-person action “at almost any time,” Activision says.
* Customizations include weapons and body armor for the members of your squad.
* Gamers can choose between playing single single-player campaigns “full of epic, cinematic moments in diverse locations around the world” and the popular survival mode where you fight off waves of increasingly difficult enemies.
* And if Game Center matters to you, Call of Duty: Strike Team supports that with global leaderboards.

* Activision warns this graphics-intensive release won’t work on the iPhone 4 and the fourth-generation iPod touch so keep that in mind before taking the plunge. By the way, the publisher certainly didn’t spare any expense at Gamescon, check out their booth.

* For those wondering, that massive 190-degree projection screen covers an area of 670 square feet and is 112 feet wide and nineteen feet tall. The resolution is an astounding 9,989-by-1,803 pixels, thanks to the combination of twelve full-HD projectors, each with an output of 40,000 lumens.
* The universal Call of Duty: Strike Team download is available now for $6.99.
* There are also in-app purchases, but mostly relegated to virtual tokens used to boost your squad members. It’s a lot like Infinity Blade: you can easily earn the virtual currency by leveling up, so you won’t need to spend any extra money to complete the game.
* Better yet, completing the campaign mode or every third wave in Survival mode, signing into a Call of Duty online account and playing the game on consecutive days will also earn you virtual money to spend on perks.
* The download weighs in at a massive 1.31 gigabytes.
* For more information about the release, head over to the official website or check out the Call of Duty Facebook page. And while we’re at it, fan iDB if you haven’t already.
