* All thanks to the Electra jailbreak, tweak developers can create add-ons and mods for improving iOS 11 and the software that it runs at every angle imaginable. We regularly cover many of the best releases right here at iDB.
* This roundup will encompass all the jailbreak tweaks that have been launched in Cydia from August 6th until August 12th. As usual, we’ll begin by talking about our favorites, and then we’ll wrap things up with an outline of the rest afterward.

* The incoming call interface on the iOS platform is an obtrusive experience, but CallBar X can fix that for you by compressing it down to the size of a notification banner.
* With CallBar X, you can continue your workflow even in the midst of a phone call, something you wouldn’t usually be able to do with the stock incoming call interface in iOS.
* CallBar X can be summoned at any time with Activator, enabling you to dial a phone number at will or perform other call-based actions.
* If you’re interested in learning more about CallBar X, then we recommend reading our in-depth review.

* ChromaHomeBarX is a Razer Chroma-inspired colorization tweak for the iPhone X’s Home Bar.
* Upon installing it, you can customize the look and feel of your iPhone X’s Home Bar with multi-color themes and animations that you might find familiar if you’ve ever used the Razer Synapse app on your Razer gaming PC.
* You can learn more about ChromaHomeBarX and how it can trick out your iPhone X’s Home Bar in our full review.

* The incoming call interface isn’t the only botched experience in iOS, so too is the volume HUD, and Pascal tackles this issue head-on.
* Pascal replaces the iOS volume HUD with a banner-style interface that incorporates media controls for your convenience. These controls include play, pause, fast-forward, and rewind, buttons in addition to album artwork and music information.
* The developer teases many new features to come in a future update, and you can learn about them in our full review.

* Certain situations exist where you may want to adjust your Camera app’s video recording quality, but Apple makes you jump through a ton of convoluted hoops to do so.
* A new jailbreak tweak called TapVideoConfig simplifies this process by allowing you to tap on the video quality indicator at the top right of the app to change the video recording quality. As you might come to expect, you can pick from any of the stock video recording quality offerings available in iOS.
* You can learn more about TapVideoConfig and why it’s such a great tweak in our full review.
