* Yesterday, the elusive and long-rumored iPad mini event was as good as confirmed for October 23rd. AllThingsD reported the date, and the well-connected Jim Dalrymple gave his “yep” of approval.
* And now that we know when it’s going to be, the next question is what is it going to be? We’ll see the smaller iPad, of course, but what else? Well the word is, there’s going to be a focus on iBooks…
* The Next Web reports:
* “In what will likely be completely unsurprising news to many, we’ve now heard from multiple sources that Apple’s as-yet-unannounced iPad mini event will have a strong focus on iBooks. Since an iPad mini would likely be squarely aimed at those who wish to partake of media on their tablets, that would make a lot of sense.”
* Other than a few rumors on the appearance of the device, little is known about the iPad mini. But given its size and anticipated price point, e-book reading with iBooks seems like a likely headlining feature.
* In addition to the smaller tablet, we could also see a few other new products at the event. New iMacs and Mac Minis are long overdue, and speculation persists about Apple releasing a retooled 3rd gen iPad.
* The iPad mini is expected to have a 7.85-inch display, thin profile, and possibly the same anodized aluminum backing as the iPhone 5. Invitations for the media event are said to go out sometime next week.
