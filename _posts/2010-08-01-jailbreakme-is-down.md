title: JailbreakMe is Down
---
* If you have tried to use JailbreakMe to jailbreak your iPhone in the last couple of hours, you probably were unsuccessful as the site appears to have technical difficulties. JailbreakMe.com actually loads ok but when you “slide to jailbreak”, nothing seems to happen.

* I have noticed weird little things going on on my iPhone 4 after trying to unsuccessfully use JailbreakMe. For example, my iPhone 4 doesn’t save pictures anymore. While I can snap pictures, they are not being saved to the camera roll. Only a reboot seems to fix this.
* There is definitely something going on with the latest version of JailbreakMe Comex uploaded to the servers.
* I suggest we call it a day and try again in the morning. What do you say?
