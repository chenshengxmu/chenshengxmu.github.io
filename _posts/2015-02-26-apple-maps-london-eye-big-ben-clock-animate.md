* Apple has started to animate certain landmarks in a three-dimensional Flyover view in Apple Maps, The Daily Mail reported Thursday. Specifically, London’s Big Ben clock and the popular London Eye now feature animated segments in Flyover.
* The face of Big Ben’s clock tower is being animated to show the correct local time while London Eye’s rotates slowly when browsed in Apple Maps’ Flyover view.
* In addition, Apple has expanded service allowing businesses to add their details to maps, including mapping animated image in real-time onto existing buildings.
* Earlier in the week, Apple added nine new cities to Maps’ Flyover view, including Baton Rouge, LA; Boise, ID; Cáceres, Spain; Clermont-Ferrand, France; Edinburgh, Scotland; Guadalajara, Mexico; Linz, Austria; Ponce, Puerto Rico; Rennes, France and Venice, Italy.
* The firm also added new data providers to Maps: GasBuddy and GreatSchools.
* MacRumors has a nice video of the spinning London Eye wheel.
* Though these animated features are initially only available for London landmarks, they’re expected to roll out in other cities “within weeks,” said The Daily Mail report.
