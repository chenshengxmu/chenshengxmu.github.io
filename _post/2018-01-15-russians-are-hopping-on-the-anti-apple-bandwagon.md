* Moscow-based law firms NLF Group and Lex Borealis have collected a number of iPhone owners who will be soon taking the company to court over the iPhone slowdown debacle.
* The Russian-language Kommersant reported (Google Translate) this morning that Russian users are prepping their first lawsuits against Apple. Maxim Karpov, who is managing partner of NLF Group, and Lex Borealis partner Dmitry Ponomarev told the business daily that their claim will be submitted to the Tverskoi District Court of Moscow and other courts.
* More than 30 class action lawsuits have been filed against Apple so far over the iPhone throttling issue, spanning countries like Israel, France and the United States.
* Months ago, local ruling found Apple guilty of illegal price fixing for iPhone 5 and 6 models.

* Apple in an open letter to customers admitted to slowing down older iPhone models with worn-out batteries in order to extend their service life and prevent unexpected shutdowns.
* It apologized for withholding this information from users and reduced the cost of non-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $25 (limited to one repair per iPhone, regardless of the battery condition). Eligible devices include all iPhone models from iPhone 6 onward, added the firm.
