title: iPhone Game Angry Birds Coming to Toys and Movies?
---
* I wondered when the App Store would produce a hit so huge that it would crossover into a cultural phenomenon. It seems that time is now, and the characters in the the limelight will be the fierce and feathered Angry Birds.

* Variety reports that the developers at Rovio have been in talks with Hollywood executives about expanding the iPhone success of Angry Birds to the next level. The following is from the original article…
* Rovio, the Finnish creator of the hit iPhone and iPad game, which has sold more than 6.5 million downloads, wants to turn the property into a major franchise that crosses over to other platforms — from TV shows and movies to toys and comicbooks.
* Apparently the toy deal is already underway according to Ville Heijari, who is a Rovio representative. Be prepared for stuffed animals designed after the main bird characters, who in the game fly in flocks to fight off evil pigs.
* I for one have never played Angry Birds so I’m curious to know from those who have if the story line is deep enough to support a featured film. Will this million dollar app be able to make the jump into Hollywood? Or will this be an overreach that ends up killing two birds with one stone?
