* We just got the chance to go hands-on with one of the first textbooks to appear in Apple’s textbook section of the iBookstore, and we were very impressed by what we saw.
* Besides the fact that the book downloads are very hefty in size, making for a pretty lengthy download time over Wi-Fi, the content is great for education. Kids in school are going to learn a lot, and best of all, they’re going to enjoy doing so.
* Check inside for our hands-on demonstration of E.O. Wilson’s Life on Earth — one of Apple’s flagship textbooks to demonstrate the power of textbooks on iPad…
* There’s tons of content contained within the two chapters available currently.
* The first two chapters feature a Welcome section and Introduction to Ecology. Again this is just the introductory example, as additional chapters will be added this spring, and in subsequent seasons until it is completed.
* What do you think? Do you think this will improve the overall learning experience of today’s school age children?
