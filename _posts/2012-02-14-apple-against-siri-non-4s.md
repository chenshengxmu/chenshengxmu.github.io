* Is there a new game of cat and mouse brewing? Reports from non-iPhone 4S Siri users indicate that there may be.
* Apparently, Apple has altered its requirements for a successful Siri connection, adding a new token to the mix that has caused problems for those who connect to a 3rd party Siri server on non-iPhone 4S devices.
* Are you one of them?
* According to Twitter and various other reports, Apple has added a new SetActivationToken to the mix, and this has caused issues for those trying to use 3rd party servers. Fortunately, there does seem to be a work-around, at least for the meantime.
* To fix these latest Siri server issues, it has been reported that a purge of the com.apple.assistant.plist file located in the var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ directory remedies the issue. I have not been able to independently confirm this, but I have heard success reports on Twitter.
* To muddy things up even more, some Siri users on non-4S devices are reporting that they’ve never experienced an issue, while many others have — I’ve received a noteworthy amount of emails and comments attesting to this fact.
* Whether this is just Apple updating Siri, or whether this was a calculated move to stymie illegitimate users, remains to be seen.
* We’ll keep our ears to the street and let you know if we hear anything. In the meantime, why not let us know what your experience has been?
