* Microsoft today said that its new productivity and teamwork app, called Planner, is now rolling out to all eligible Office 365 customers worldwide. “Beginning today, Planner will start rolling out to all eligible tenants,” said the Windows giant.
* “We expect the rollout to be complete in the next several weeks.” Companion Planner apps for iOS, Android and Windows are currently being worked on and should release later this year.
* Designed to make teamwork a more frictionless process, the new app offers a highly visual way to organize teamwork. You can create new plans, organize and assign tasks, share files, update statuses, chat about what you’re working on and get updates on progress—all from within this app.

* Microsoft says Planner can be used to manage a marketing event, brainstorm new product ideas, track a school project, prepare for a customer visit or just organize your team more effectively.
* Here’s a quick video overview of Planner, courtesy of Microsoft.
* Each new plan created in Planner automatically creates a new Office 365 group.
* Upcoming updates will implement additional features the ability to assign a task to multiple users, external user access, plan templates, customizable boards and more.
* As mentioned, eligible Office 265 subscribers (Office 365 Enterprise E1–E5, Business Essentials, Premium and Education subscription plans) will automatically see the Planner tile appear in the Office 365 app launcher when it’s available for them to use.
