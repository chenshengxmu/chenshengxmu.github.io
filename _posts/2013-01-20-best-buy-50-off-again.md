* Good news for all of you folks who missed out on the holiday iPhone discounts. Best Buy is once again knocking $50 off all iPhone 4S and 5 models, regardless of model or carrier.
* The limited-time sale matches some of the best prices we’ve seen on Apple’s handsets, knocking the 16GB iPhone 5 down to $149.99 and the 16GB iPhone 4S down to just $49.99…
* 9to5Mac spotlights the deal, which appears to be available both in-stores and online, that discounts all iPhone 4S and 5 models that are purchased with a two-year carrier contract.
* This knocks the 16GB iPhone 5 down to $149.99, the 32GB down to $249.99, and the 64GB to $349.99. And outside of a few hard-to-find Walmart and Sam’s Club offers, these are the best prices we’ve seen on Apple’s latest handset.
* It looks like the discounting is only good for a couple of days. So if you’ve been looking for a deal on the iPhone, you may not want to wait on this.
