* The White House has announced that President Obama is scheduled to meet with a number of tech executives tomorrow to discuss a wide range of subjects. Two of the big topics on the menu are said to be the NSA and the troubled HealthCare.gov website.
* In addition, the group—which includes Apple CEO Tim Cook, Twitter’s Dick Costolo, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, and Dropbox’s Drew Houston—will discuss ways the Obama administration can partner with the tech sector to create new jobs and grow the economy…
* Here’s the report from Time:
* “Tomorrow, President Obama will meet with executives from leading tech companies to discuss progress made in addressing performance and capacity issues with HealthCare.Gov and how government can better deliver IT to maximize innovation, efficiency and customer service,” a White House official said. “The meeting will also address national security and the economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures. Finally, the President will discuss ways his Administration can partner with the tech sector to further grow the economy, create jobs and address issues around income inequality and social mobility.”
* And here’s the full guest list:
* This will be the second time in the last 6 months that Tim Cook and several of these executives have met with Obama to discuss privacy concerns and government surveillance. Many of them convened back in August following Edward Snowden’s staggering NSA slide leaks.
* Those slide leaks, which happened in early June, named 9 major tech companies—including Apple—as willing participants in a government surveillance program known as PRISM. Apple, like the other companies, has since issued a statement denying its involvement.
* Earlier this month, Apple joined Microsoft, Facebook and other tech companies in urging Congress to reform government surveillance tactics.
