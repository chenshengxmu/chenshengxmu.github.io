* Available for pre-order since CES 2015, Insteon said today its hub with support for Apple’s HomeKit will begin shipping to retail stores early next month. Dubbed the Insteon Hub, the device can now be ordered at $149.99 through Amazon.com and via SmartHome.com.
* Controlling HomeKit-enabled accessories away from home requires a hub in the form of a third-generation Apple TV with Apple TV software 7.0 or later, or a dedicated product like the Insteon Hub.
* The appliance, along with a companion iPhone app, basically brings Insteon’s smart home products like switches, outlets, thermostats and light bulbs into the HomeKit ecosystem, when paired with the Insteon Hub.
* The hub allows you to control smart home appliances from an iOS device, using Siri commands, configure a single device to turn on and off at dusk and dawn, create customized groups of devices that turn on and off at various times throughout the day and much more.
* And like the company’s previous-generation Insteon Hub, the new appliance supports the Nest thermostat.
* In addition, the new and redesigned Insteon+ for iPhone app works with any HomeKit-enabled product from other manufacturers, making it easy to control an entire connected home in one place. The app (requires iOS 8.1 or later) features brand new controls and has a simplified user interface, making it easy to add devices, rooms, zones and more in a straightforward manner.

* With HomeKit, complex scenarios can be created to direct Siri, say, to “turn off downstairs lights.” The Insteon+ app supports the creation of these scenes that adjust multiple devices with advanced features like On Level and more.
