* Motion is a new jailbreak tweak that can seriously spice up your iPhone’s Home screen, if you’re into that sort of thing. The tweak does this by adding quite a few animation options to the app icons on your Home screen.
* Best of all, Motion clocks in at a reasonable $1 on the Cydia Store. Should you try it out? Check out our hands-on video inside and judge for yourselves…
* Motion adds the following animation options: Rotation, scaling, skew, flip, jump, transparency, vertical wave, and horizontal wave by means of a panel in the Settings app.
* All of the animations can be toggled on and off both independently or simultaneously, and the first 6 animations can all animate simultaneously as well.
* The bottom line: If you’re looking to add some serious visual mayhem to your iPhone’s Home screen, then pony up that buck and install Motion. It’s compatible with iOS 4 and iOS 5, and you can find it on the BigBoss repo.
* Are you tempted to add Motion to your Home screen?
