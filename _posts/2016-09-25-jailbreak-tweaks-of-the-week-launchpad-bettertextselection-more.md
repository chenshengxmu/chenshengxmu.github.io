* Launchpad is a new tweak that puts an information center right at your fingertips whenever you invoke the Reachability interface.
* There are several pages of information, including date, music, notifications, Control Center toggles, and more. You can configure which pages appear and in the order they appear.
* Even if your device doesn’t support Reachability, you can still use ReachAll to enable it on your device and use this tweak with it.
* To learn more about Launchpad, and how it works, you can read our full review.
* AdaptiveColorPower: Removes the green fill from the Lock screen battery indicator (free – review)
* BetterTextSelection: Improves the crappy iOS text selection process (free – review)
* MadridDelete: Lets you delete SMS and iMessages right from the Lock screen (free – review)
* Although that wraps it up for this week, there are sure to be more releases by next weekend.
* In other news, well-known iOS hacker Luca Todesco has shown that it’s possible to jailbreak the new iPhone 7 on iOS 10. Be sure to stay tuned in to iDB and we’ll continue to keep you updated with the latest jailbreak coverage.
