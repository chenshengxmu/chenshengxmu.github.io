* KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo issued a new report to investors today with some adjusted predictions for iPhone sales during the all-important holiday quarter. Buoyed by the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the prominent Apple analyst sees the company selling 71.5 million during the 3-month period.
* For some context, Apple sold 51 million iPhones during the year-ago holiday quarter. Kuo believes the iPhone 6 will be the leading cause for the dramatic jump, accounting for 41.6 million iPhone sales—nearly 60%. The 6 Plus, he says, is in a distant second due in large part to supply shortages.
* Following the blowout holiday quarter, however, Kuo sees iPhone sales dropping down below 50 million units, due mostly to poor off-season demand. He also believes Apple will discontinue both iPhone 5c and 4s models, despite their success in emerging markets, to streamline its handset offerings.
* Rounding out his predictions, Kuo expects Apple to introduce refreshed 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones next fall, pushing the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus down to the mid-tier price point, and the iPhone 5s to “free.” The move will make the Touch ID security feature ubiquitous across all iPhone models.
