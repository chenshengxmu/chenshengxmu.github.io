* Pod2g has just made another big announcement regarding his progress on the iOS 5.1 jailbreak. A few moments ago, the hacker tweeted that he had jailbroken [untethered] a third-generation iPad running iOS 5.1.
* The news comes just one week after we received word that pod2g’s iPhone 4 had received the untethered jailbreak treatment on iOS 5.1, as the iOS expert seems to really be hitting his stride…
* “Hey. iPad 3,1 running iOS 5.1 untethered. Next on the list: stabilizing the payload, then trying 5.1.1.”
* The weekly updates are reminiscent of the weeks leading up to the original iOS 5 jailbreak that came late last year, so hopefully it won’t be too much longer. If nothing else, it’s a good sign that things seem to be going smoothly.
