* At this point, we’ve seen so many photos of purported budget iPhone shells that it’s hard to imagine Apple not launching the handset this fall. But just in case you are still skeptical, we’re adding more evidence to the pile this morning.
* A new hi-res hands-on video of a yellow iPhone shell, believed to belong to Apple’s low-end handset, hit the web late last night. And it gives us an extremely close up view of both the outside, and inside of the so-called iPhone 5C’s casing…
* The video comes from Sonny Dickson, who has posted photos of a number of iPhone 5C components over the past few weeks. And although we obviously can’t verify the part’s legitimacy, it does match up perfectly with previous 5C leaks.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the handset’s story, it’s simple. Apple has long been rumored to be working on a low-end iPhone for prepaid and emerging markets, and about 6 months ago the rumor reared its ugly head again.
* But this time it’s different, though. This time we have affirmation from multiple news outlets. This time we have photos and videos of cases. And this time we have a name, we think: The iPhone 5C. And of course the ‘C’ stands for ‘Color.’
* The handset is expected to debut alongside Apple’s iPhone 5S next month, at its all-but-confirmed September 10th media event. As you can see it’s made of plastic, and will come in a variety of colors, with a price tag in the neighborhood of $300.
* Update: while we’re at it, how about a few iPhone 5C packaging mockups for good measure? (via 9to5Mac)
