* One of the pitfalls of Apple iOS is the lack of a good notification system. By notification system, I mean a panel where one can view all their notifications in a consolidated panel, much like the notification panel of Android OS.
* Instead, we have a system that, with every pushed notification, you get a popup alert, a sound and a badge on the application icon which presents itself as a useless system once you dismiss the popup alert. Once the popup is gone, the risk of forgetting the notification opens up.
* LockInfo, by David Ashman, picks up where Apple slacks by providing us with a very useful notification panel that can be set as your lockscreen, your first Springboard page and/or a panel activated by Activator (known as InfoShade). The latter provides Android-like functionality with a panel available from any screen, whether from within an open app or not…
* LockInfo’s Plugins API allows users to extend functionality to provide even more information on the notification panel. It currently ships with 5 stock plugins so you can customize panel with the information you want:
* In addition to the stock plugins, there are a few other plugins available in the Cydia Store to provide more information with more on the way.
* LockInfo is packed with options and is fully configurable via the device’s Settings.app and has support for Retina display (iPhone 4 only), status bar icons and screen rotation as provided by SBRotator and LSRotator.
* The developer works very hard and has a very frequent release cycle for his beta testers. While average users should use the stable release, anyone is welcome to add the developer’s beta repo (http://iphone.ashman.com/beta) to Cydia to access the beta versions.
* LockInfo is a commercial app available in the Cydia Store that comes with a price tag of $4.99, a free 14 day trial and licenses for up to 3 devices.
* Personally, this is one of my favorite jailbreak apps and one of five reasons I jailbreak my devices. What about you? On the fence about buying LockInfo? Do you use LockInfo? What do you think about it?
