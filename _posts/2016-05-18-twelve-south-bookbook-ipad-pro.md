* Twelve South’s BookBook vintage leather case series is now available in iPad Pro sizes, the company announced today. The new BookBook for iPad Pro has a built-in kickstand that tilts the device to the sketcher’s angle for effortless drawing, painting and sketching. Plus, it folds easily into upright mode so that you can present more easily.
* As a nice bonus, the case has a built-in holster inside its spine for an Apple Pencil or another stylus brand. BookBook for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is available starting today, while a version for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is slated to arrive later this summer.
* Like other BookBook leather sleeves, this one too has a pair of hardback covers, the reinforced spine which provides impact protection and a soft microfiber interior to keep your iPad Pro’s case in pristine condition.

* “Call us romantic, but we envision BookBook for iPad Pro like a weathered sketchbook, carried under the arm of a wandering artist, centuries ago.” said Andrew Green, Creative Director at Twelve South.
* “There’s something timeless about protecting your state-of-the-art iPad in a warm, vintage, leather book. Surely, if that artist was alive today, he would be creating on an iPad Pro, in a BookBook.”
* Here is a promotional video for the new accessory.
* Unfortunately, your Smart Keyboard won’t fit in this case, nor will an iPad Pro with a shell because the accessory was designed to fit your iPad Pro snug inside the sleeve.
* However, you can get a BookBook for the 13-inch Retina MacBook instead, which has enough room for an iPad Pro and a Smart Keyboard. BookBook is also available for iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPhone 6/6s, iPhone SE, MacBook and other Apple devices.

* To switch to display/presentation mode, simply unsnap the frame that holds an iPad Pro in place and fold the case’s soft hinge over. You can easily adjust the angle of your device to make hands-free usage easier, optimize your movie watching experience and more.

* “Let the ideas flow naturally from your Apple Pencil onto the retina display, then simply fold the kickstand, stow your Apple Pencil in the built-in holster, pull the dual zippers closed, and safely transport your masterpiece in a case that has the look and feel of a vintage portfolio,” the company wrote.

* Risking to sound like a commercial, I can say that I use BookBook cases exclusively to protect my Apple devices while traveling and couldn’t be happier with them. Twelve South does make one of the finest accessories that match Apple’s fits and finish and attention to detail.
* BookBook for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $99.99 a pop and is now shipping when ordered directly from twelvesouth.com. The case will be available from most other Twelve South resellers soon. The BookBook for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will begin shipping later this summer.
