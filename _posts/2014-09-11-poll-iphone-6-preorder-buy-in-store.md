* Apple will start accepting pre-orders for the newly-introduced iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus tomorrow, September 12, a full week before the device is scheduled to land on store shelves the next Friday, September 19.
* Busy folks may opt to have their phones delivered to their doorsteps while others may prefer the excitement of launch day festivities and mingling with like-minded fans at one of Apple’s brick and mortar stores.
* Are you going to pre-order your iPhone 6 from the comfort or your home or will you waltz inside your nearest carrier or Apple Store on September 19 at 8am?
* To refresh your memory, Apple said that the new iPhones will be available from the Apple Online Store, Apple’s retail stores and through AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, additional carriers and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* The phones are scheduled to launch in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the United Kingdom beginning on Friday, September 19.
* The handsets are available in Space Gray, Gold and Silver and three storage tiers: 16, 64 and 128 gigabytes. The 16/64/128GB iPhone 6 is $199/$299/$399 after a two-year contract and its iPhone 6 counterpart (offered in same capacities) carries a $100 premium.
* Cast your vote now.
* I would definitely prefer waiting in the line.
* Sadly, there’s no Apple Store at or nowhere near my location so I’ll just have to ask a friend to buy my device at one of Apple’s German stores and have it delivered over here.
