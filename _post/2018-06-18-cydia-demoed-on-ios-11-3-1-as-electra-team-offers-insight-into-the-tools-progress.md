* As we inch closer to the imminent release of an Electra jailbreak tool with support for iOS 11.2-11.3.1, we’re beginning to see exciting tidbits and teasers from the developers of the Electra Team that are actively working on it.
* Among those was a Tweet shared by @nullriver, which incorporates numerous screenshots depicting the iconic Cydia app running on iOS 11.3.1:

* But if witnessing Cydia running on iOS 11.3.1 wasn’t enough excitement for one day, then another series of Tweets shared by @Pwn20wnd may captivate your attention:

* As it would seem, there was overwhelming interest from the community in a feature that would let jailbreakers quickly revert to a ‘stock’ state to bypass jailbreak detection in specific apps, like Fortnite.
* Pwn20wnd responded to the community’s request with “I will be taking that one!”
* He also shared that most of the UI for Electra 11.3.1 is complete; however, the Electra Team is waiting to obtain a few exploit-related puzzle pieces that will make jailbreaking iOS 11.3.1 as easy as tapping a button:

* Even CoolStar offered some insight into the future of Electra, noting in a Tweet that there wouldn’t be a public beta or developer-only release. Instead, the Electra Team will only push a fully-public version of the jailbreak tool when the time is right:

* It’s great to see the Electra Team listening to the community and integrating highly-requested features into their upcoming jailbreak tool, but it’s just as inspiring to know that progress is moving full-steam ahead and that a release is just around the corner.
* There’s no official ETA for the updated Electra jailbreak tool with support for iOS 11.3.1, but it’s important that community members remain patient and avoid harassing members of the Electra Team with questions about ETAs or early-access requests. The short answer is: the tool will be ready when it’s ready. Period.
