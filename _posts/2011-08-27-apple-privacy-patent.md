* It’s been a big week in Apple news. We’ve had a resignation, a new CEO, and plenty of other tidbits to come out of Cupertino. Now we have another patent application to add to the proceedings.
* The patent in question relates to a possible method of “Obfuscating the Display of Information and Removing the Obfuscation Using a Filter. That’s a mouthful by anyone’s standards…
* That rather grand title points to a grand patent, and Apple doesn’t disappoint.
* What all the diagrams and technical talk comes down to is a new privacy screen that can be made to hide or display different content depending on the manipulation of “color, frequency or polarity.”
* Interestingly, a filter could be used in order to display information which, as Engadget points out, could be housed a glasses. It doesn’t sound a very Apple-like solution, but remember, this is just an patent application. And as we all know, anything goes in patent applications.
* We’ll believe it when we see it!
