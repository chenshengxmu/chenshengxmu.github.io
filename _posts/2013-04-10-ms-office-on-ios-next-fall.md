* Over the last several months, there’s been a lot of talk regarding the potential for an iOS version of MS Office. Folks particularly want to see it land on the iPad, as research shows the move could be worth some $2.5 billion to Microsoft.
* But despite all of the chatter, we have yet to see any indication that Office is on its way to Apple’s mobile platform. And it doesn’t look like we’re going to anytime soon. A new report suggests the app suite won’t land on iOS until next fall…
* ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley claims that a reliable source has shown her a real roadmap for Microsoft’s upcoming ‘Gemini’ updates. This includes major updates to Office for Windows 8, Office for Mac, and yes, Office for iOS and Android.
* “Also on the roadmap for fall 2014 is what’s listed as iOS/Android support for Office. One would assume this is the expected and widely rumored Office for iPad release. It could, however, be Office for iPhone and Android phone, given that it’s not listed on the roadmap as being tablet-specific.
* Rumors about Microsoft’s plans to deliver Office for iOS and Android have been circulating for more than a year. Microsoft officials have never outright denied these apps were in development. A number of us Microsoft watchers heard from our various sources that these apps were on track to be delivered by early- to mid-2013.”
* The list of Office for iOS rumors is getting pretty lengthy these days. Last summer, Microsoft was seen hiring an iOS engineer to work on its Office team. And in December, references to an iOS Office suite were spotted on the company’s website.
* But in order for it to happen, Apple and Microsoft will have to agree on a revenue sharing model for the software. The word is, Microsoft wants a discount on Apple’s usual 30% cut it takes from developers on MS Office, and Apple’s not budging.
