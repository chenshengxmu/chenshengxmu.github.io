* Apple just posted an early morning press release announcing the arrival of the iPad Pro. Apple states that the iPad Pro will be available to purchase online starting on Wednesday, November 11, and will arrive in Apple retail stores, select carrier stores, and authorized resellers later this week.
* The iPad Pro starts at $799 for the base model Wi-Fi-only version with 32GB, $949 for 128GB Wi-Fi-only model, and $1079 for the top of the line 128GB model with Wi-Fi and LTE cellular connectivity. All models come in the familiar silver, gold, and space gray color options.
* Along with the iPad Pro, two accessories—the Apple Pencil and the Apple Smart Keyboard will also be available for purchase starting Wednesday. The Apple Pencil retails for $99 and the Smart Keyboard, which is only available in US English keyboard layout will be available for $169. The Smart Keyboard ships in one color, charcoal gray.
* Additionally, Apple is producing new polyurethane Smart Covers for the iPad Pro, which will be available in two colors—charcoal gray and white. The Smart Covers will retail for $59. Apple is also making new iPad Pro Silicone Cases, and those will be available in the same two colors, but retail for $20 more at $79.
* According to Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller, the early response to the iPad Pro from app developers and customers has been great. Per Schiller:
* iPad Pro is the most powerful iPad we’ve ever made, giving users the ability to be even more creative and more productive with the epic 12.9-inch Retina display, powerful 64-bit A9X chip and groundbreaking Apple Pencil and new Smart Keyboard. We can’t wait to see what they do with iPad Pro.
* Of course, Apple is going to highlight the positives, but it’s hard to argue with Schiller over the sheer power and size of the device. The iPad Pro is the largest tablet that Apple has produced at nearly 13 inches, and it is without a doubt, its most powerful tablet as well.
* The iPad Pro also includes a monster amount of RAM (for Apple, at least) with 4GB. Again, Apple has never put more than 2GB of RAM in any of its products that aren’t laptops or desktop computers. Along with these beefy specs, customers can expect the same 10-hour battery life that they currently enjoy with most iPads today.
* The press release also includes quotes from several representatives from companies like Adobe and Paper, which highlight the creative potential of the device. It’s obvious that Apple is strongly positioning the iPad Pro as a workhorse for creatives, not just a passive consumption device. In Apple’s eyes, this truly is a machine for professionals.
* Here is one quote from Adobe vice president of Products, Scott Belsky:
* “With the larger iPad Pro screen and lightning-fast performance, creatives will be able to take full advantage of Adobe’s family of Creative Cloud mobile apps. For example, the ability to manipulate a 50-megapixel image right on iPad Pro in Photoshop Fix and then send that image to Photoshop CC on a desktop, for further refinement, is the kind of industry-advancing collaboration that millions of Adobe and Apple customers will benefit from.”
* Here’s another from James Cuda of Savage Interactive, makers of Procreate 3:
* “iPad Pro’s gorgeous 12.9-inch Retina display lets you create massive artworks: up to an incredible 16K in resolution. This new level of definition allows for large format printing and exceptionally detailed artworks. Procreate 3 is also built for Apple Pencil. Its remarkable accuracy, pressure sensitivity, tilt detection and palm rejection make Apple Pencil the tool we’ve been waiting for.”
* iPad Pro will be available in the following countries: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greenland, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, UAE, US, UK, Uruguay and US Virgin Islands
* The iPad Pro looks pretty good. I’m still on the fence about purchasing one, but if I do decide to get one, it’ll definitely be with the Apple Pencil. The Apple Pencil is a must-have going by some of the responses that I’ve heard from those who’ve gone hands on with the iPad Pro. The Smart Keyboard looks a little on the awkward side, but I’m interested in trying that as well.
* As far as size goes, 32GB seems a bit paltry for a device this big that’s heavily focused on creativity. I’d lean more towards the 128GB Wi-Fi-only model, since I can always use my iPhone to tether if I need internet while away from Wi-Fi.
* Is the iPad Pro scheduled to arrive in your country? If so, do you plan on purchasing one?
