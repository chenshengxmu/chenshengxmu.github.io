* If you’re a Twitter user and you’re always finding stuff in your Twitter timeline that you could really care less about, then you might like a new free jailbreak tweak called TweetMuter by Tanner Bennett.
* This tweak utilizes the existing Muted Words feature in the stock Twitter app, a feature that normally only applies to your notifications tab; but TweetMuter expands this functionality to even your timeline so that you don’t have to mute people entirely, nor will you have to un-follow people to stop seeing only certain things.
* The tweak works pretty good for a myriad of things, such as eliminating your timeline of everyone’s annoying-as-hell political drama, as well as helping to clear your timeline of spam and other unwanted updates.
* The way it works is simple; when you’re ready to mute a specific word or phrase from your Twitter timeline completely, you follow these steps:
* 1) Go to the in-app settings in Twitter.
* 2) Open the Notifications preferences pane.
* 3) Open the Muted words preferences pane.

* 4) Tap on the + Add Muted Word or Phrase button.
* 5) Enter a word you want to add to the filter, then tap on the blue Done button.
* Now that the muted word or phrase has been added, you can see how the tweak filters away tweets that contain the muted word from your Twitter timeline:

* In our example, we added the word “jailbreak” to our list of muted words, so now all Tweets that contain the word “jailbreak” won’t appear in our Twitter timeline.
* If you’re like me and you’re pulling your hair out over people’s obtuse political opinions right now, and you’ve had just about enough of reading them when you’re in the middle of trying to take care of other things, this is a great tweak to help filter out those stressful moments from your Twitter timeline, allowing you to focus more on the things that matter most to you.
* TweetMuter requires the stock Twitter app, which can be had for free from the App Store if you’re not already a user. If you’re interested in downloading TweetMuter, on the other hand, then you can grab it completely free of cost from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now.
* Also, if you’re even the least bit interested in programming and have an interest in how the tweak works, the developer has open-sourced the source code on GitHub for the world to see.
* Will you be downloading TweetMuter to help cleanse your Twitter timeline of the things you don’t want to see? Share below!
