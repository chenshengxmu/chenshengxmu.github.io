* Apple on Thursday seeded the sixth beta of iOS 11.4 to developers. Registered developers can download the new beta through Apple’s dev center, or it can be installed using the OTA update mechanism.
* Today’s release comes just a few days after beta 5, indicating that either iOS 11.4 is nearing a public launch or there were bugs/issues in the previous beta that simply couldn’t wait a week(s) to be corrected.
