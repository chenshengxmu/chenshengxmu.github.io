* Apple Japan announced (Google Translate) Friday that it’s going to offer free repairs of customers’ devices directly damaged by the record rainfall that hit southwestern Japan earlier this month and caused hundreds of deaths, flooding, landslides and collapsed infrastructure.
* The following devices are eligible for free repairs:
* Proof of ownership may be required.
* This offer is limited to any devices damaged by July’s heavy rains as long as they’re actually repairable, excluding accessories like AirPods, Beats headphones and Apple TVs.
* The company will return serviced products to customers free of charge, but there may be delays because some courier firms in the flooded areas are temporarily disrupted.
* The offer expires at the end of September, 2018.
* Apple is not accepting submissions online so affected customers are advised to instead call the local Apple Support hotline 0120-27753-5. Anyone interested can get more details at the Disaster Information page of the Cabinet Office.
