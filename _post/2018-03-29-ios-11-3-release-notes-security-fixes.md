* On Thursday, March 29, 2018, Apple released the iOS 11.3 software update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch with battery health assessment in Settings, the ability to disable Apple’s controversial CPU throttling at will and other new features.
* You can download iOS 11.3 directly from our Downloads section.
* The iOS 11.3 software is compatible with any iPhone model from iPhone 5s onward, as well as with iPad Air or later and the sixth-generation iPod touch.
* To update your device to the latest available version of iOS, go to Settings → General → Software Update and follow the onscreen instructions. To deploy the update using your computer, connect an iOS device to a Mac or Windows PC, select it in iTunes, then select the Summary tab and click the Check for Update button.

* The new battery health and performance management features are iPhone-only and available in Settings → Battery → Battery Health (Beta).
* Off by default, performance smoothing kicks in once your iPhone starts experiencing unexpected shutdowns due to an excessive draw on its worn-out battery. You can turn this off by tapping a tiny Disable button to keep your iPhone operating at full speed, but at the risk of unexpectedly shutting down and reducing your battery lifespan.
* Apple outlined how this works in a support document on its website:
* Users can see if the performance management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns is on and can choose to turn it off.
* This feature is enabled only after an unexpected shutdown first occurs on a device with a battery that has diminished ability to deliver maximum instantaneous power. This feature applies to iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.
* Aside from battery health assessment on iPhone, iOS 11.3 also includes a new iPad charge management feature designed to prolong battery health on Apple tablets that are connected to power for long periods of time.
* Here’s everything new, fixed and improved in the iOS 11.3 software:
* iOS 11.3 introduces new features including ARKit 1.5 with support for more immersive augmented reality experiences, iPhone Battery Health (Beta), new Animoji for iPhone X users and more. This update also includes stability improvements and bug fixes.
* iOS 11.3 also fixes the following vulnerabilities:
