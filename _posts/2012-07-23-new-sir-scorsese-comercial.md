* Apparently the handful of class-action lawsuits haven’t shaken Apple’s marketing team. The company has just released a new television ad starring its often-criticized digital assistant.
* The fourth in a string of celebrity spots, famed film director Martin Scorsese co-stars with Siri in this new iPhone 4S commercial set in what looks to be a New York City taxi cab…
* While this ad seems to follow the script of the previous Siri commercials, there is one difference. As noted by 9to5Mac, this might be the first time Apple has used its Find My Friends app in a tv spot.
* Previous Siri commercials have featured popular actors John Malkovich, Samuel L. Jackson, and Zooey Deschanel. And if you’re wondering what makes Martin Scorsese famous, he’s directed a long line of hit movies including GoodFellas, The Departed, and Gangs of New York.
* What do you think of the new ad?
