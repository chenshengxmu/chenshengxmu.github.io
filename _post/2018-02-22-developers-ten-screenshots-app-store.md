* Developers can now upload and feature up to ten screenshots per device on App Store.
* Apple on Thursday informed its registered developers and members of the Apple Developer Program that they can display more screenshots on their product pages than before.
* “You can now display up to 10 screenshots on your product page on App Store for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV, to show customers more of your app’s experience,” it said.
* Depending on the orientation of the screenshots, the first one to three images will appear in search results when no app preview is available. “Focus each subsequent screenshot on a main benefit or feature so that you fully convey your app’s value,” the Cupertino firm advises.
* Previously, developers could display up to five screenshots on any given product page on App Store and up to three app videos, also known in Apple talk as app previews.
