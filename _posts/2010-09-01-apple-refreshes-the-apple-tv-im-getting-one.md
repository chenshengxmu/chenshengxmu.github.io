* Steve Jobs just unveiled the new Apple TV, a little tiny box a quarter the size of its predecessor. It’s now all about renting. No more buying things.
* You can rent first run HD movies the day they come out for $4.99. They run cheaper as time goes on.
* HD TV shows now rent for $0.99, with, let me remind you, no commercial.
* ABC and Fox are on board. Even better, if you’re a Netflix subscriber, you can stream movies for free. You can stream directly from YouTube, view images from Flickr. Additionally, you can stream any content from your Mac or PC.
* The new Apple TV will now sell for $99. That’s what the rumor said. It’s dirt cheap and makes me want to buy one. Instantly.
* The Apple TV will be available in 4 weeks and you can pre-order today.
