* AT&T has hit some major milestones in its LTE quest this fall. As of early September its 4G network covered over 240 million people, in over 400 markets. And it’s not showing any signs of slowing down.
* The carrier announced another major expansion of its LTE network this week, giving folks in 14 markets access to the speedy connection for the first time. We’ve posted a list of the new areas after the fold…
* In AT&T’s press release, it again claims to not only have the fastest wireless network but also the most reliable—a title Verizon has long claimed. It cites anonymous independent third-party data as proof of this.
* The carrier says it has a goal to cover 270 million people with LTE by the end of the year, and it wants to have its entire 4G LTE network rollout done by the end of 2014.
