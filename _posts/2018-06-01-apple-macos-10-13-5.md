* Apple has released macOS 10.13.5 to the public. The new update for Mac is available now for download over the air (OTA). 
* In March, Apple released macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 with support for external graphics processors and Business Chat in Messages. The update also contained a number of additional features, as well as bug fixes and stability improvements. Soon after, the first beta version of macOS 10.13.5 went to developers.
* The highlight of macOS 10.13.5 is the introduction of Messages in iCloud. The feature is also available in iOS 11.4, which launched earlier this week.
* Best called the big tease, Messages in iCloud was first announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2017 and demoed through beta software throughout the year. However, it was removed in final software versions last fall.
* The feature moves Messages to iCloud and in doing so, allows you to sync conversations across all of your devices, including iOS, macOS, and watchOS. In other words, when you delete a message on one device, it’s gone on the others too.
* This update also includes bug fixes and performance improvements for issues not addressed in macOS 10.13.4.
* Apple’s likely to unveil the successor to macOS 10.13 High Sierra at WWDC in June. We could also see the arrival of new Macs at that time.
* To deploy the latest software update over the air, go into the App Store app on your Mac. From there, click the Update tab at the top right of the screen. Click Update next to the macOS 10.3.5 update.
* For the full list of fixes and new features in macOS 10.13.5, check out the official release notes.
