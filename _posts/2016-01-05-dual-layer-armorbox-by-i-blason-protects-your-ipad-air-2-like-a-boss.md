* We’ve got another rugged case to tell you about as part of our accessory spotlight series, which is where we showcase a variety of accessories, from cases to speakers, which are top of their class. We select the products in this series to highlight based on a high consumer rating, although we may not have tested them ourselves.
* You may know by now that I love camping. I also love bringing my gadgets with me when I spend time in the great outdoors. I know that goes against what most people consider “roughing it,” but some of my favorite pastimes involve sitting around the campfire listening to podcasts, or watching a movie in my tent when the world outside is totally black.
* If you like to bring your iPad Air 2 with you on camping trips, or maybe you are just prone to accidents and just want to protect your tablet with a rugged case, you should check out the ArmorBox by i-Blason.
* i-Blason is popular for their ArmorBox series of cases for smartphones and tablets. The dual-layer case for iPad Air 2 has one polycarbonate, impact-resistant hard shell and a second silicon soft cover for extra cushion and grip.
* The plastic hard shell is form-fitted to the iPad Air 2. It features a top section with a built-in screen protector, which keeps out dust and particles when you are hiking the trails. Conveniently, the screen protection top section is optional.
* The backside of the hard shell houses a kickstand. Once the case is secure, you can slide the kickstand out and set up your iPad in landscape mode for watching movies.
* The silicone soft cover comes in a variety of colors and slips over the top of the hard shell. It provides a second layer of protection from drops, but also gives you a bit of extra grip if you tend to have fumbly fingers.
* The ArmorBox comes in all black, or black with blue, red, or yellow, and white with green, pink, or purple. You can pick one up on Amazon for $23.
