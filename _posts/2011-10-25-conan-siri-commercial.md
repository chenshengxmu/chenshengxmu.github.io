* Chances are you’ve seen Apple’s newest commercial for Siri. It features random people talking to Siri in all sorts of situations, whether it be trying to tie a bow tie or trying to send a text message.
* Comedian and talk show host Conan O’Brien has a slightly different vision for what the Siri commercial should be like, so he put together a parody version of the popular commercial that features some more interesting questions for Siri to answer…
* Spot on.
