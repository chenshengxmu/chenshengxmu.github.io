* Even though iOS has seemingly been turned inside out over the past few years, there are still a few easter eggs hidden in the software. Earlier this month we told you about the invisible buttons on the iPad’s split keyboard, and now we’ve come across another little-known feature.
* Obama Pacman points out this cool little trick that allows you to quickly access your most recent email draft in iOS. All you have to do is open the native Mail app, and hold your finger down on the compose button. This should load your last drafts.
* Considering that the standard process for recalling a draft in the Mail app is a multi-step affair, this tip could certainly come in handy. Not to mention that it provides another great example of Apple’s dedication to user experience. Interesting.
