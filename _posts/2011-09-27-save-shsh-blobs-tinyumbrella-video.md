* There’s no two ways around it, TinyUmbrella is just as much of a staple to jailbreakers, as the tools that actually perform the jailbreaks. For that reason, I figured it was only right to create a standalone TinyUmbrella tutorial, which shows you how to manage your SHSH blobs.
* With TinyUmbrella, your blobs can be retrieved from either Apple, or Cydia. In this video tutorial, I show you the difference between both methods and how to save your SHSH blobs for possible firmware downgrades…
* TinyUmbrella isn’t rocket science, but this brief refresher course helped me remember just how great this little bit of java magic really is. You can download TinyUmbrella from our downloads page, or by visiting the official TinyUmbrella blog.
* Do you use TinyUmbrella? If so, what’s your favorite part about this jailbreak community staple?
