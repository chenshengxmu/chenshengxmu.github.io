* According to Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, which knows this stuff inside out, Apple’s Asian suppliers are now starting to receive orders for the components that will be used in a second-generation Apple Watch.
* Samsung, along with other overseas manufacturers like Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, have reportedly secured component orders for the Apple Watch 2, which one analyst believes could be up to forty percent thinner and debut at Apple’s annual developers conference this summer.
* The news is also significant as it suggests that Samsung will continue building chips for Apple’s wearable device. The Apple Watch’s system-in-package (SiP) chip, dubbed the S1, combines a lot of components in a resin insulated package, including mobile DRAM, NAND flash and a Samsung-made CPU.
* Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, which exclusively supplies Apple with these system-in-package modules for the Apple Watch, will reportedly continue to build the majority of the SiPs for the second-generation device, according to industry sources.
* Amkor Technology and STATS ChipPAC, a unit of Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology (JCET), have also obtained a portion of SiP package orders for the upcoming device.
