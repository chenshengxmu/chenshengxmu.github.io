* Apple executives on several occasions during the just-finished WWDC keynote made note of both the fact that the new Mac Pro is being built in the United States and that the redesigned iOS 7 software and other apps are being conceived, designed and implemented by its team of engineers in California.
* In fact, Apple’s been proudly putting stickers on its products saying ‘Designed by Apple in California’ for years and has now even made a compelling new ad which focuses in its California design roots…
* Just watch it…
* So, what do you guys think?
* To me, this is almost as good as Apple’s other mission-statement ad, titled We Believe.
