* Premium, Apple-exclusive accessory maker Twelve South has refreshed its lineup of vintage leather cases that offer both protection and nice disguise with two new versions, one for the iPad Air 2 and the other for the iPad mini 4. In addition, the company has previewed a BookBook case for the iPad Pro, which will be shipping this Spring.
* BookBook for iPad Pro will have “features that complete your iPad Pro,” including a display stand, a built-in sketching angle and an integrated pocket to protect and store your Apple Pencil.
* BookBook for iPad Pro is pictured top of post and, as mentioned, is scheduled to start shipping this Spring. We’ll keep you updated as soon as it becomes available.
* To register your interest, visit the Twelve South website.
* Joining Twelve South’s existing iPad BookBook family, the new BookBooks for iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 are handmade leather cases that have built-in viewing and typing stands and holes that give you direct access to the iPad’s connectors, sensors and cameras without having to remove the case.
