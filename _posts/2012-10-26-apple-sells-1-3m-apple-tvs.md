* While going over its sales figures for the quarter yesterday, Apple once again neglected to mention the Apple TV. In fact, it wasn’t even until an analyst asked a question about it, that Tim Cook spoke of the product.
* This should kind of give you an idea of how Apple views the $99 set top box. It’s obviously not near as important as say the iPhone or, any of its other iOS devices. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not selling well…
* In response to a question from Benjamin Reitzes of Barclays Capital regarding the Apple TV, Tim Cook said that Apple sold 1.3 million of them last quarter. That makes more than 5 million ATVs sold this year.
* Cook goes on to say that due to the size of the revenue of the Apple TV business in comparison to Apple’s other businesses, it’s still considered a hobby. He then cheekily comments “However it is a beloved hobby.”
* Either way, that’s some hobby. If you take 5 million Apple TVs, and you multiply that by the average $100 price tag, that’s $500 million. That’s more than some companies generate from all of their products combined.
* Cook ended his remark with the usual “we continue to believe there is something more there, and continue to pull the strings to see where it takes us” statement. A common response to questions on Apple’s future TV plans.
* On that front, it seems that all of the speculation regarding Apple building a full-sized television has died down as of late. But now that the iPad mini rumors have materialized, some believe the TV is next in line.
