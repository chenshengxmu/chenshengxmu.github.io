* CoverMeNot is a brand new jailbreak tweak that does something extremely simple, yet just as brilliant — it doubles the height of your status bar when a notification banner appears on screen. This prevents the banner from covering up the content on your iPhone — hence the name.
* Once the banner notification times out, the status bar is resized back to normal. If you’re tired of incoming banner notifications covering up your on screen content, then you need to try CoverMeNot…
* The developer of CoverMeNot, cjori, is the same developer behind such tweaks as Dashboard X, so you know you’re dealing with a quality tweak that will be well maintained. Once you install CoverMeNot, that’s all there is to it. There are no settings or options to configure; you’ll simply notice it working whenever you receive a new banner notification.
* True, it’s not the most impressive jailbreak tweak in the world, but it’s free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo, and it solves a real issue with iOS’ banner notification system. Apple should take a long and hard look at CoverMeNot, and consider implementing it in an future version of iOS.
* What do you think?
