* Football season has long been over and basketball is getting there, but baseball season is just getting started. And for fans of the sport who are either on T-Mobile, or thinking about it, you’ll be interested to know that the carrier is once again offering MLB At Bat Premium to customers.
* As noted by Droid-Life, the promotion is season-long, beginning May 1 and running through the end of September. To qualify, customers must download the MLB At Bat app on Android or iOS while on T-Mobile’s network—you will not get the discount if you are on Wi-Fi or roaming.
* For those unfamiliar with MLB At Bat Premium, it typically runs $2.99 per month or $19.99 annually, and offers a library of content and features for baseball fans. Those features include live streaming of select games, in-game highlights, look-ins, pitch tracking and analysis, and more.
* This is just the latest in a string of discount content offerings by T-Mobile in a bid to attract and retain customers. Last summer it announced that it would offer Rhapsody’s streaming service for free to select customers, and free music streaming from other top services to everyone else.
