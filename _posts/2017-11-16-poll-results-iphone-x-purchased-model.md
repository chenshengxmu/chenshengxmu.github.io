* Two weeks ago, we ran a non-scientific poll asking you to specify which iPhone X model you’ve managed to purchase, and the results are now in.
* TL;DR: more than half of the readers who voted gravitate towards pricier models.
* About sixty percent of respondents said they snagged the higher-priced $1,149 version of iPhone X, which has larger 256GB storage, while the remaining forty percent went with the lower-priced $999 iPhone X model.
* In terms of finish, nearly two-thirds of you (62.15%) went with the Space Gray color option while more than one-third of respondents (37.85%) opted for the Silver finish.
* The poll is now closed, here are the results.
* Which iPhone X model did you buy?
* We also ran a similar poll ahead of iPhone X preorders that gauged early interest in the device, with nearly four in each ten respondents saying they planned on preordering their iPhone X in Silver and more than six out of each ten respondents wanting to opt for the Space Gray finish.
* Which iPhone X model do you plan to preorder tonight?
* In terms of price, 57.55% of respondents told us they’d preorder the more expensive $1,149 Space Gray model, with 42.45% interested in preordering the entry-level $999 64GB model.
* Your actual purchases practically mirror your buying intentions ahead of pre-orders with more than half of you who’ve bought an iPhone X opting for the higher-priced version.
* So, which iPhone X did you purchase? And while we’re at it, have you managed to get your hands on the same model you planned on preordering?
* Sound off in the comments section!
