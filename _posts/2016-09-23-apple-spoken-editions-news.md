* You’ll soon be able to listen to news articles in iTunes, reports TechCrunch. The outlet says that in the near future, you’ll be able to browse through a new category of podcasts that will allow you to listen to news stories from your favorite publishers.
* These new podcasts will be labeled “Spoken Edition” in iTunes, and the format will be short-form programs that offer listeners an audio version of a publisher’s articles. So you could essentially listen to the news while commuting or working out.
* During early tests on iTunes, Spoken Editions for several media brands showed up.
* Wired, for example, will launch Spoken Editions for “Business,” “Science” and its homepage. TIME will offer a Spoken Edition called “The Brief.” Forbes, .Mic, Bustle, Playboy, OZY, and — yep — TechCrunch (which I discovered while browsing our iTunes page, of all things) will have Spoken Editions, it seems, as all popped up for a time on iTunes.
* The links to all the publishers’ Spoken Editions have since been pulled, after our discovery and outreach.
* Spoken Editions podcasts are expected to launch in October, and yes there will be ads—with revenue split between publishers and SpokenLayer. The text-to-voice company powering the platform prides itself in its ability to become “the voice” of brands.
