* HBO on Thursday pushed out an update for its HBO Now streaming app, bringing the iOS client to version 1.3. The update is a significant one for folks running iOS 9, particularly those with a late-model iPad, as it adds compatibility with some of the new software’s features.
* The most important of those features is Picture in Picture, which allows [newer] iPad owners to watch videos in a small, standalone window while using other apps. Additionally, the update adds support for Spotlight Search, as well as various other bug fixes and improvements.
* For those unfamiliar with it, HBO Now launched earlier this year as a standalone streaming video service. For $14.99 per month, users are given unlimited access to a large library of on-demand content, including hit shows like Game of Thrones, no cable subscription required.
* For cable subscribers who already have access to HBO, a separate app called HBO Go gives you similar on-demand access to the network’s content. This app was also updated today with iOS 9 feature support, but there is no specific mention of Picture in Picture compatibility.
* You can download HBO Now here and HBO Go here.
