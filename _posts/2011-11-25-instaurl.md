* InstaURL is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to perform web searches from anywhere on your iDevice.
* Similar to QuickGoogle and QuickSafari, InstaURL isn’t alone when it comes to tweaks of this nature.
* Is it different enough to warrant paying the $0.99? Check inside for the full video walkthrough…
* Personally, I will always prefer QuickGoogle because it allows Google searches from anywhere and it’s free.
* QuickSafari costs $0.99, but it also includes a full search history for users to reference.
* The main difference with InstaURL is that it allows you to search Yahoo and Bing as well. If that’s a compelling enough reason for you, then InstaURL might be worth the buck.
* Let me know what you think about InstaURL in the comments section below.
