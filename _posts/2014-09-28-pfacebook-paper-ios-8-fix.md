* Social networking behemoth Facebook at last has gotten around fixing a pair of annoying issues with its Paper application on the iPhone and iPod touch devices running Apple’s refreshed iOS 8 mobile operating system.
* In addition to unspecified performance improvements that should ensure Paper is as fast as ever, the new version has solved problems with Facebook Push Notifications and Camera Roll access on iOS 8 devices.
* As I explained thoroughly in this post, Apple’s inexplicable removal of the default Camera Roll album in the stock Photos application on iOS 8 devices has confused apps such as Paper.
* Specifically, Paper used to look for the missing Camera Roll that couldn’t be found so the app defaulted to the Recently Added album, which only holds photos taken in the last 30 days.
* In turn, puzzled users were left scratching their head wondering why the app couldn’t access their entire photo library. The update has addresses this so now you can select from all of your photos and videos on iOS 8.
* Some other popular apps are plagued with this annoying Camera Roll issue on iOS 8 including WhatsApp, which recently pushed an update to rectify the problem.
* Finally, if you previously experienced problems with undeliverable alerts in Paper, the new version ensures that Facebook Push Notifications work properly on iOS 8. I noticed being unable to turn on the option to receive all notifications in Paper instead of the main Facebook client, so I’m glad the team has fixed this annoyance.
* Paper 1.2.3 changelog:
* Paper, a 53.4-megabyte download, runs natively on the iPhone and iPod touch, but still lacks UI optimized for the iPad’s spacious canvas. The app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Readdle was quick to update its entire line of apps for iOS 8. Last week, the team pushed updates for PDF Converter and Scanner Pro with support for iOS 8 extensions.
* [App Store]
