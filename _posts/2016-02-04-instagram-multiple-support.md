* It appears Instagram has begun testing support for multiple accounts on iOS. As noted by the folks at Latergramme, a number of iPhone users began noticing the new option on Thursday, which allows you to add and sign out of more than one account.
* To see if you have access to the feature, make sure you have the latest version of the Instagram app, and click the Options icon in the top right-hand corner of your Profile page. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and you’ll see the new ‘Add Account’ option.
* Once you’ve added an account, you’ll be able to easily switch between them with just a couple of taps. You simple tap on the Log Out option of the currently active account, and choose which one you’d like to log into. You can also log out of all accounts.
* Since only select users are seeing the new feature, it’s hard to tell if Instagram is slowly rolling it out in stages, or merely testing it like it did on Android last fall. If you’re not one of the lucky few, it’s worth noting there are other ways to gain the functionality.
