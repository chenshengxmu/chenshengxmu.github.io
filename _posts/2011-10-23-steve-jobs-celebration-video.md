* Last week Apple held a special event on its main Cupertino campus to celebrate Steve Jobs’ life. The event was streamed all around the world to Apple employees, but unfortunately, the rest of us were not able to watch.
* Apple today posted the video of the full event for everyone to watch…
* The video can be streamed directly from Apple’s website.
* In order to see the video, you’ll need Safari 4 or 5 on Mac OS X Snow, Safari on iOS 3 or later, or QuickTime 7 on Windows.
* [Thanks Jason]
