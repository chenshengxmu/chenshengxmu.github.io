* It seems like we’ve seen a flurry of iPhone-related rumors today. Earlier, we learned that Apple has begun internally seeding sixth-generation iPhone prototypes with 1GB of RAM and a modified A5X chip. And now we’re finding out about its appearance.
* As noted by AppleInsider, Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White issued a note to investors this morning regarding information he picked up during a recent trip to Asia. And judging from what he learned, Apple is completely rebuilding the iPhone…
* “In our view, this will be the most significant iPhone upgrade with a four-inch screen and a new, sleek look that we believe will require a unibody case. This new, sleek look will be the most important reasons that consumers decide to upgrade.”
* If you feel like you’re having deja-vu, it’s because you are. Last year we heard a ton of rumors claiming that the fifth-generation iPhone would feature an all-new design. But as we all know, they never materialized. Apple unveiled the familiar-looking 4S last October.
* For what it’s worth, a redesign certainly makes sense this year. The iPhone 4/4S design has been around for 24 months now. And folks coming out of their two-year carrier contracts will be primed to buy something new and different.
* And with a new look and updated features, White believes that Apple’s iPhone launch in the December quarter of this year could be “extraordinary.” In fact he sees it “dwarfing previous launches” — including the record-breaking 4S opening.
