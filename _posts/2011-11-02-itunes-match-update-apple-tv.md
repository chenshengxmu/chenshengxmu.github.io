* Today Apple released iOS 5.0.1 beta with several bug fixes, and the company also pushed out iTunes 10.5.1 beta 2. This update was pushed out on the Dev Center and Apple notified developers via email.
* This is one of the biggest updates to iTunes Match yet, adding Apple TV support. This means you will now be able to stream your iTunes Match library straight to your Apple TV. 
* This update to iTunes also fixes some bugs. If you had some previous iTunes beta problems, this update should help. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t made iTunes Match available for the general public yet, missing its promised “end of October” timeframe.
* Here is the change log for iTunes 10.5.1 beta 2:
* “iTunes 10.5.1 beta 2 is now available and includes a number of important stability and performance improvements. iTunes Match is also now available for testing on Apple TV.On your Apple TV, choose Music > Turn on iTunes Match. Please remember to backup regularly and do not delete the music you add to iCloud from your computer.”
* If you’re a registered developer with access to the latest betas, let us know what you think of iTunes Match on the Apple TV!
