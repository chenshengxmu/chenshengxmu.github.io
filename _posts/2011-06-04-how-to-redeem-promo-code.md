title: How to Redeem a Promo Code in the App Store
---
* We sometimes do app giveaways and every time we do one of those, there is someone to ask me how to redeem the promo codes. I really thought that we had already written a post about that, but after doing a quick research, well, turns out we haven’t.
* In this post, I will show you how to quickly and easily redeem an App Store app promo code, either from iTunes, or even better, directly from your iPhone…
* Step 1: Launch iTunes and go to the iTunes Store.
* Step 2: Make sure you are on the iTunes Store homepage, and look to the right, in the sidebar, you should see the following image.

* Step 3: Click on “Redeem”, which should take you to this page:

* Step 4: Enter the promo code in the text box, then hit “Redeem”. The app will start downloading to your library of apps.
* Step 1: From your iPhone, go to the App Store app.
* Step 2: Navigate to the “Featured” section.
* Step 3: Scroll all the way down, and tap the “Redeem” option. You should now see this screen:
