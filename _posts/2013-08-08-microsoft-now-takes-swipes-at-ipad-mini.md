* Wow, there’s just no stopping Microsoft’s marketing people in their anti-iPad crusade. As it’s done several times this summer, the Windows giant yesterday posted a Surface commercial which predictably takes swipes at Apple’s full-size iPad, criticizing its $499 asking price, lack of SD card slot and limited Office compatibility (go figure).
* You’d have think Microsoft’s ad agency would not release another iPad bashing commercial until next week. Much to our surprise, however, a mere 24 hours later a new commercial has surfaced on YouTube, this time on Microsoft’s WindowsVideos channel.
* And for the first time, the software giant is targeting the iPad mini by pitting Acer’s 8.1-inch Iconia W3 tablet against Apple’s popular 7.9-inch $329 device. I’ve included the ad for your viewing pleasure right after the break…
* “The competition just got smaller,” YouTube description reads.
* Here, have a look.

* Wait, we can’t play games on the iPad mini?
* This is really a continuation of a theme prevalent in the previous Surface ads.
* That being said, I’m not so sure Microsoft is doing itself any favor by painting the iPad overpriced while insisting that Windows 8 tablets are real computers.
* If price, Office compatibility and ability to run legacy Windows apps were determining factors, then Microsoft would have been the king of the hill rather than an also-ran.
* I guess Redmond didn’t get the memo.
* Anyway, what did you think of this commercial?
