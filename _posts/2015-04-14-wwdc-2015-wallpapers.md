* Earlier today, Apple sent out invitations to their 2015 Worldwide Developer Conference to be held Monday, June 8 through Friday June 12. As with all previous WWDC events, it is safe to assume the five-day conference will begin with a kick-off press event and announcement.
* In recent years, Apple used WWDC to show off and highlight major renovations to iOS and OS X. With the Apple Watch launch this spring, it is possible Apple may even highlight new opportunities for Watch OS, including native applications for the new flagship device.
* Of course, to celebrate, we have included event invitation-inspired wallpapers to match “The epicenter of change” graphics. Step inside to see the handy work of our readers.
