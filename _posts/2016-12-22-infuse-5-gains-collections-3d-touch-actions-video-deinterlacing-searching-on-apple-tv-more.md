* These Collections are accessible in all existing Library categories or through the new dedicated Collections section. Speaking of search, the refreshed Apple TV app now has a search feature in the top left corner. It lets you instantly find movies, collections, TV shows or episodes by entering one or more letters.
* Of course, tvOS’s Dictation feature allows you to use Siri to dictate a full title.

* Aside from Collections and search, Infuse for Apple TV introduces advanced settings for your Up Next list allowing you to choose between the new Watching Only and Recently Added Only options.
* With support for 3D Touch Quick Actions, you can now press Infuse’s Home screen icon to quickly jump into an appropriate media folder in Infuse or continue watching your last title, right from the Quick Actions shortcuts menu. These shortcuts are only supported on 3D Touch-enabled hardware like iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
* Infuse does not currently support in-app Peek and Pop gestures via 3D Touch.

* As mentioned, Infuse now supports video deinterlacing for converting interlaced video, such as common analog television signals or 1080i format HDTV signals, into a non-interlaced form. Video deinterlacing is available across iOS and tvOS editions of Infuse.
* Last but not least, Infuse 5.1 resolves the orientation issue with iPhone landscape lock and contains minor playback enhancements and other minor improvements and fixes.
* Infuse 5 for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV is a free download from the App Store with optional Pro features available as a $6.99 per year subscription through the app.
* However, if you subscribe to the app through the end of the year they’ll treat you to a permanent 30 percent subscription price discount. To take advantage of this discount, download Infuse 5 and start your free month-long trial of Infuse Pro before 2017 arrives.
* If you’d rather buy the app outright than pay an annual subscription, grab the $12.99 Infuse Pro 5 for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.
