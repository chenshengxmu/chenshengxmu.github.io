* Pangu launched the first iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak this past week, and it took everyone by surprise. The jailbreak currently supports all 64-bit iOS 9.3.3 devices, and while that’s great, people with 32-bit devices are left in the dark.
* Pangu has confirmed this weekend with its new official Reddit account that 32-bit support for the iOS 9.3.3 probably isn’t going to see the light of day.
* The confirmation was made in a Reddit thread on Sunday following Pangu making an official Reddit account to answer some frequently asked questions and to clear up some confusion regarding the honesty of the jailbreak.
* “Sorry there is no plan for 32bit now,” the Pangu jailbreak team replied.

* Apple’s mobile devices use a system on a chip (SoC) architecture that has shifted away from 32-bit and towards 64-bit starting with the iPhone 5s. All devices iPhone 5c and prior are 32-bit.
* The iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak supports all of the following 64-bit devices:
* The following devices are 32-bit, and are not supported:
* As there are fewer 32-bit iOS devices on the market today than 64-bit devices, 32-bit devices are becoming somewhat of legacy devices in the technology world. They’re getting old and slow, and development teams are getting sick of having to support them when most people are moving forward. The future is clearly 64-bit, and that’s where jailbreaks are headed too.
* Saurik mentioned on Reddit recently that the reason Pangu probably didn’t include 32-bit support for Pangu for iOS 9.3.3 is because it would have required double the work that they’ve already put into this jailbreak. Pangu hasn’t yet officially commented on why they will not be making a jailbreak for 32-bit devices on iOS 9.3.3, so this is all speculation.
* With all of the confusion and work that has been put into the jailbreak already, it seems to make sense that doing all of this over again for a very small portion of iOS device users wouldn’t be worth Pangu’s time. This is especially so when you take the time to consider that Apple is fighting back by revoking certificates necessary for the jailbreak to work.
* If you own any of the 32-bit devices listed and they’re still jailbroken on iOS 9.0.2, we recommend just staying put. Enjoy your jailbreak. It doesn’t look like a jailbreak for iOS 9.3.3 will be coming for you any time soon, and iOS 10 is already on its way to public release this Fall.
* If you’re on iOS 9.3.3 on your 32-bit device already, just be patient for iOS 10, which will have plenty of new features for iOS. After all, Pangu is working on a jailbreak for iOS 10 too, and who knows, maybe that jailbreak will support 32-bit devices? Unlikely… but possible.
* As there will be no jailbreak for 32-bit devices running iOS 9.3.3, those with 64-bit devices can follow out tutorial on how to jailbreak with the English Pangu jailbreak tool.
