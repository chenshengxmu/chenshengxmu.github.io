* Silicon Valley giant Google rightfully trusts tech enthusiasts will be falling over themselves to adopt its Android-driven Glasses, going as far to commission a pro to take a series of fashion photographs featuring beautiful, smiling models. Apple, on the other hand (pun intended), is said to be entering the wearable computing space with a smart watch-like gizmo believed to be conceptualized as your most intimate computer yet.
* Google’s bet is that advanced augmented reality features are enough to talk people into putting up with the unusual glasses dancing on their nose. And if iWatch talk is for real, then Apple must be thinking its users won’t have a problem wearing a curved-glass watch around their wrist like some Dict Tracy copycat.
* The truth is probably somewhere in the middle: some folks will readily adopt these wearable devices and others will wave them off as a function over form. Which brings me to today’s poll: if you were forced to choose between the two, which one would you rather wear in public – Google’s Glasses or Apple’s iWatch?
* The comparison isn’t totally fair because one is the existing product and the other is just vaporware at this point. Not that it’s stopping analysts from predicting a $15 billion addition to Apple’s bottom line from iWatch, by the way.
* Here’s The Guardian’s iWatch mockup.

* If that thing looks too hideous to you, here’s another concept by Swedish designer Anders Kjellberg.

* And the back.

* I also like this one by an unknown artist.

* Okay, cast your vote now.
* Would you rather wear Apple’s iWatch or Google’s Glasses
* As always, you’re invited to detail your vote down in the comments and discuss whether we as a society have evolved past these things.
* Is the time nigh for wearable computing?
* Will we as a species ever be cool with wearing unusual devices disguised as fashion accessories?
