* Ember, a digital scrapbook app from the Clear to-do app’s creator Realmac Software, arrived back in July as a rather pricey $49.99 Mac App Store download. Despite its punishing price tag, I wrote that Ember struck me as an Evernote replacement I’ve long been yearning for. The team has since added a few new features such as Smart Drawing, Colours and iCloud sync, while squashing dozens of bugs.
* And now, they’ve confirmed that the iOS version will be available in December. This is great news as I can now introduce Ember into my daily workflow, hopefully being able to jot down notes, create journals and manage my notebooks on whatever device I happen to be using, be it a Mac, iPad, iPhone or iPod touch…
* With Ember for Mac now using iCloud, the team set out to work on the most-requested feature, Ember for iOS. According to Realmac’s blog post, Ember for iPhone and iPad will be arriving in December.
* Ember for iOS allows you to add images from your iPhone and iPad to your library, take photos of things that inspire you, and organize your library on the go.
* They stopped short of revealing other features, but we do know that Ember for iOS will be a free universal app requiring iOS 7. There won’t be much of a feature parity between Ember for Mac and iOS, at least not initially.
* In the coming months, Realmac is planning to add annotations and other features. In taking cues from free-to-play games, these upcoming feature additions will be provided as in-app purchases, though the ability to view and organize your Ember library “will always be available for free”.
* Ember for Mac.

* Even though Ember for Mac actually replaced Realmac’s popular LittleSnapper, it’s a totally new app with lots of advanced capabilities. In addition to Clear and Ember, Realmac created Analog Camera for iOS and recently released Hatch, a Tamagochi-like iPhone game that sells for$1.99 a pop.
