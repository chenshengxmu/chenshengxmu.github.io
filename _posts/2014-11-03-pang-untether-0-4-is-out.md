* As promised, the Pangu team has updated the Pangu iOS 8 – iOS 8.1 Untether package in Cydia to version 0.4 today. The update includes a fix for random application crashes on 32-bit devices—iPod 5, iPhone 4s/5, iPad 2/3/4 and the original iPad mini—particularly with Safari.
* The update follows version 0.3, which was released over the weekend to fix an overheating issue in jailbroken 32-bit devices. The update was pulled shortly after it hit, due to users reporting “mild to serious issues” with the package, but the issue was resolved and it was re-posted.
* Even if you have a 64-bit device, or haven’t experienced any crash-related issues on your 32-bit device, it’s still recommended you update, as you [typically] want the latest version of Pangu. Be sure to save any work before you update, because the process does require a reboot.
* Unfortunately, there’s still no word on when an OS X Pangu tool will be available. The Pangu Team did say on Friday, however, that once it has ironed out the issues in its current release, it will focus on a Mac utility, so the good news is that the software is still in the cards.
