* Upon refreshing your Cydia sources this week, you should take note of a new free jailbreak tweak called NavAway by iOS developer Wh0ba.
* Just as the tweak’s name suggests, NavAway makes your iPhone’s navigation bar magically disappear as you scroll down in specific scrollable applications. When you begin scrolling back up in the app, NavAway intelligently reveals the navigation bar again for your convenience.
* The animated GIF above depicts how NavAway works. You’ll notice just how smoothly the navigation bar disappears and reappears right before your eyes, relative to the direction you’re scrolling.
* As we noted earlier, the tweak works in specific apps. You can select the apps NavAway works with from the dedicated preference pane that gets added into the Settings app:

* Here, you can toggle individual apps on or off. The “on” setting enables the effect, while the “off” setting disables it.
* You’ll notice that there isn’t a respring button to save your changes, and that’s because a respring isn’t necessary. You will, on the other hand, need to force-close impacted apps from your App Switcher and restart them to begin experiencing NavAway’s effects during use.
* It’s particularly useful that you can configure NavAway on a per-app basis, as this prevents potential conflicts in apps that don’t play nicely with effects of this nature.
* All in all, NavAway is a simple tweak that offers a full screen-like experience whenever the navigation bar isn’t needed. The additional screen real estate lets you view more information at a glance and provides an augmented user experience.
* If you’re interested in trying NavAway, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 9, 10, and 11 devices.
