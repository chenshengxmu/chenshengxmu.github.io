* Siri’s popularity has been somewhat of a controversial topic over the last 6 months. Although the digital assistant dropped some jaws when Apple introduced it to the public last fall, a lot of folks have since written the feature off as a novelty.
* But according to a recent study from Parks Associates, a consulting firm, Siri is much more popular than you probably would’ve guessed. Surprisingly, 87% of iPhone 4S owners surveyed use at least one Siri-related feature each month…
* Parks polled 482 iPhone 4S owners to try and gauge how popular Siri is 6 months after its introduction. As aforementioned, almost 90% of the participants admitted that they used the assistant on a monthly basis to complete one or more tasks.
* It seems making phone calls and sending text messages were the most popular Siri-driven activities — roughly a third of those polled used the service for one of these actions. In contrast, 35% of the survey participants said they’ve never used the assistant to play music or schedule a meeting.
* Perhaps the most interesting statistic from the report were the user satisfaction ratings. 55% of the iPhone 4S owners reported that they were satisfied with Siri, 9% claimed they were unsatisfied, and the rest were somewhere in the middle.
* Apple still has Siri labeled as a ‘beta’ product, and is expected to drastically expand the digital assistant’s capabilities at some point in the future. It’ll be interesting to see where the feature is at two years from now.
* What are your thoughts on Siri? Are you satisfied, unsatisfied?
