* If you like adding personalization on your jailbroken device, then sometimes it’s the simple things that stand out the most. Subtly changing UI colors so they don’t overpower the whole interface or user experience is just one example of this concept.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called Tinc by iOS developer ridn lets you tint the interfaces of Notification Center and/or Control Center in iOS any color you like, and is a testament too subtle customization.
* Shown above, you can see the tweak’s visual impact on Notification Center, and the same can be said about Control Center in our screenshot examples below:

* The colorization effects don’t seem to stand out as much in Control Center as they do in Notification Center, but this can likely be chalked up to the different blur effects found in each interface. Nevertheless, the colors are distinguishable.
* Tinc adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak:

* Among the things you can configure here are:
* The random option is a good way to keep things looking different from time to time since it gives you something new to look at every time you open an interface you customized. Additionally, if you can’t seem to decide what color to use, randomizing it makes things easier because the tweak will make the decision for you.
* Tinc doesn’t overpower any of your interfaces, so you can still easily read notifications, widget information, Control Center labels, and more without conflicts or eye-strain. It’s a great aesthetic tweak for jailbreakers that can look great with or without a complementary theme.
* If you’re interested in giving the tweak a try for yourself, Tinc is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
