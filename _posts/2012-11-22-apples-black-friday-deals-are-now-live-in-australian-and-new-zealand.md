* Apple’s online stores in New Zealand and Australia went offline earlier this morning in preparation of the previously teased Black Friday deals. The one-day shopping event offers a $100 discount on select MacBook Pro and Air models and various savings on the newest iOS devices and accessories like EarBuds and Smart Covers. The Black Friday deals page is now live on Apple’s online stores in New Zealand and Australia. We’re expecting the deals to go live on the US Apple Store soon and will updated this article accordingly…
* The one-day shopping event in Australia is valid on 23 November, 2012, from 2:01am to 24 November, 2012, 1:59am local time.

* A notice on the web site reads:
* Enjoy special pricing on all the great gifts below. Buy online and get fast, free shipping. Or shop at your favourite Apple Retail Store, where you’ll enjoy faster checkout with Express Shopping.
* Apple usually offers modest savings during holiday promotions and often times other retailers undercut the Cupertino firm with more tempting deals. Best Buy knocked $50 off select Apple products and threw in a $75 gift card, for example.
* MacMall started their Black Friday sale early, knocking up to $799 off select products and throwing in free shipping for all orders over $25. And if don’t mind used products, make sure to check out eBay’s new Apple-certified refurbs.
