* Always eager to respond to Apple’s latest moves swiftly and boldly, Samsung of South Korea took to Twitter following yesterday’s iPhone 6/Apple Watch/Apple Pay press conference to share an interesting banner which uses Steve Jobs’s own words as a weapon against Apple to dismiss its decision to make bigger iPhones as long overdue.
* “No one is going to buy a big phone,” reads the quote on Samsung’s snarky anti-iPhone Galaxy Note 4 banner. “Guess who surprised themselves and changed their mind,” another line reads.
* The attached image is accompanied by the following message on Twitter: “Big improvements and innovation come with change – even they thought so”.
* I love how Samsung’s message substitutes “Apple” with “they”. It’s not clear whether this is just a quick swipe at Apple or part of a broader anti-iPhone campaign.
* For what it’s worth, the tweet links to the Galaxy Note 4 mini-site hosted at the morethanbig.com domain, which tells us we should be expecting more of the same.
* “There’s more to a big screen smartphone than just all that extra real estate,” reads the message on the mini-site. In another jab at Apple, the message adds that “it’s what you do with it that matters most”.
* The website invites visitors to check out Note 4’s headline new features and its AMOLED display “and see for yourself why our big screens are such a big deal”.

* Apple is promoting the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus under the somewhat confusing “bigger than bigger” tagline, which Samsung counters with the #morethanbig hashtag.
* For the sake of completeness, Samsung started using the hashtag before Apple took the wraps off its bigger iPhones.
* But Samsung isn’t the only one spoofing Apple’s U-turn on phablets.
* Taiwan-based HTC, for example, ridiculed yesterday’s event, writing on Twitter: “Bigger screen. Better performance. Elegant design. Welcome to the party #iPhone6.” The tweet is accompanied by the image of HTC’s M8 handset and a blurred iPhone 6, suggesting Apple copied HTC’s design.

* The message is reminiscent of Apple’s August 1981 anti-IBM newspaper advertisement released two weeks after the debut of IBM’s first personal computer, the IBM PC.

* Apple opened yesterday’s press conference with another mission-statement video.
* Titled “Perspective” and included below, the three-minute clip reinforces Apple’s approach to product design and its philosophy of saying a thousand no’s to a single yes.
* There are a number of references to Samsung: at one point, we see a scene with the huge words “FIRST, FIRST, FIRST” written on the wall — a not-so-subtle reminder of Samsung’s status as a fast-follower.
* I guess you could say that Apple brought all of this unto itself the minute they aired this iPhone 5 ‘Thumbs’ ad.
* That Samsung banner is a sick burn, wouldn’t you agree?
