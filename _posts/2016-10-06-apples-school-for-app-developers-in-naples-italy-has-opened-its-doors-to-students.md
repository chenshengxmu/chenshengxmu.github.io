* Apple’s European iOS App Development Center at the University of Naples has opened its doors to students on Thursday. British newspaper The Guardian visited Apple’s school for programmers in the days leading up to the launch, showing off the facility in a batch of photos. The project was formally announced in January 2016. Specialized curriculum gives students practical skills and training on developing iPhone, iPod touch and iPad apps.
* Università di Napoli Federico II in Naples, one of the oldest universities in the world, is hosting the tuition. The university is providing a dedicated facility at its new campus in San Giovanni a Teduccio, a coastal suburb east of Naples, with specialized labs and access to the latest Apple hardware and software.
* Classes have commenced today in Apple-designed open-plan classrooms, with 200 mostly southern Italian pupils set to get their training on writing code based on Apple technology by the end of the year.
* According to Business Insider, that’s approximately a five percent admission rate—about the same as Harvard, Stanford and other elite colleges in the United States.
* All told, about 4,000 people reportedly applied for spots.
* Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world.
* Couches and a lounge area in the other half of the classroom give the students a chance to rest. The Cupertino company was even involved on details such as the lighting in the classroom and the color of the walls.
* Each student will be handed the latest iPhone, iPad and Macbook at the start of the nine-month course. Courses are available at no charge thanks to a joint investment of about $11.6 million by Apple and University of Naples Federico II.
* The academy will be open to about 400 students next year.
* “We are thrilled to be working with Universita’ di Napoli Federico II to launch the first iOS Developer Academy in Europe,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO, in July 2016.
* Here’s what Tim Cook said when the initiative was launched in January:
* Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success.
* The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent.
* Both students and teachers can apply at the University of Naples website.
* The initiative should expand to other countries around the world.
