* Launch supply of Apple’s new iPad Pro could be constrained as the supply of panels for the 12.9-inch device faces shortages, DigiTimes reported Tuesday. As per their supply chain analysis, iPad Pro shipments are expected to reach less than 3 million units in the fourth quarter of this year, which amounts to an average of one million iPad Pros a month.
* Interestingly enough, the report mentions that the iPad Pro uses IGZO display panels, as previously rumored, which are based on indium, gallium, zinc and oxide. IGZO technology, also known as oxide LCD, is very power efficient.
* Not only do IGZO panels require just a fraction of power compared to LCD IPS screens found on iPhones and other iPads, but allow for more vibrant colors and deeper blacks with quick response times and high color saturation.
* As per DigiTimes’ analysis, Sharp is currently the sole supplier of IGZO panels for the iPad Pro. LG Display is said to supply a small volume starting November, while supply from Samsung will begin in 2016.
* “As a result, Apple is only able to start shipping the iPad Pro in November and its shipments will be between 2.5-3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2015,” according to Digitimes Research.
