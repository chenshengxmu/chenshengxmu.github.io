* With security and privacy very much at the front of everyone’s minds these days, the possibility of having your private SMS messages read is something that will send a shiver down the spine of plenty of people, especially if you are sharing sensitive information.
* A new iPhone app plays to those fears, while also providing a workable solution that, as far as we can tell, isn’t going to be as annoying as you might first think.
* Black SMS is not an iMessage or SMS app replacement, and in fact, it could be used with email or any other encrypted text. What it does do is allow users to type text into the app and then have it encrypted, ready for decryption on the other end…
* The whole process isn’t as long-winded as it sounds. Create a password and type a message into Black SMS. Copy and paste the result into an email or SMS and hit send. The receiving party then does the opposite – copy the received text and paste it into Black SMS. After entering the password, the text is decrypted. Simple.
* The app itself costs $0.99 and if you’re the kind of person that likes to ensure correspondence remains private, then you’ll want to check Black SMS out sooner rather than later.
* [Mashable]
