* Apple is shooting to release a Gold Master build of iOS 7 to developers by September 10, if BGR is to be trusted. Gold Master refers to a final version of software that’s ready for release to manufacturing – it’s usually the same build as the version that comes factory preloaded on latest devices.
* The publication reports that Apple will make a final Gold Master build available to its employees and carrier partners five days early, on September 5. More tidbits right below…
* BGR also learned from its sources that Apple is gearing up to seed iOS 7 Beta 6 sometime next week.
* Our sources have not confirmed which day, though Monday makes the most sense as it has been the typical release day in the past.
* The Gold Master seed set for release to carriers around September 5 should be the software that will get released to the public later on in the month of September, “barring any major bugs or problems that might be discovered,” BGR notes.
* While BGR has a mixed track record, the blog correctly pinpointed the iOS 7 Beta 3 release date and looks to be on track concerning Apple’s iOS 7 schedule.
* Apple is slated to hold a media event on September 10 to likely announce the iPhone 5S and 5C and it’s fitting to release the GM build that same day. Both phones are expected to run iOS 7 out of  the box.
* The revamped mobile operating system will run fine on older devices, too.
