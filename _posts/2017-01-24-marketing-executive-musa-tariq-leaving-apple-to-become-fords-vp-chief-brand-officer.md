* Musa Tariq, Apple’s executive, is leaving the company to join Ford, the car maker said Tuesday.
* Tariq was Apple’s global marketing and communications director for retail for a little more than two years. At Ford, he will be Vice President and Chief Brand Officer, a new position created as the company focuses on new mobility services.
* Tariq, 34, will report to Stephen Odell, who is Ford’s Executive Vice President of Global Marketing Sales and Service, as well as to Ray Day, Ford group’s Vice President of Communications.
* As Ford’s Chief Brand Officer, he’ll be working with marketing, communications and company leaders across the globe to help build and advance the brand.
* Tariq is scheduled to begin his new role on January 30.
* “As we grow our business, we’re also expanding our focus on and investment in building and differentiating our iconic Ford brand, which is known, loved and trusted around the world,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said in a statement.
* “Musa has led transformational work at some of the world’s most admired brands, and he is a leader known for challenging convention. We’re excited for him to bring his expertise, knowledge and passion to Ford.”
* Prior to joining Apple in August 2014, Tariq had previously served as Director of Social Media and Community at Nike, and was the global head of Digital Marketing. He later became director of Social Media at Burberry. Tariq is believed to be close with Apple’s retail head Angela Ahrendts, who worked as Burberry’s CEO.
