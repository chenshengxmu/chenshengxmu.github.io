* If you’re jailbroken on iOS 8.3, you’ve likely been frustrated by the lack of Cydia Substrate support up until now. As you’re no doubt aware of by now, Cydia Substrate hasn’t worked on iOS 8.3 due to a fix that needs to be implemented by the folks at TaiG.
* The good news is that the fix is out, and I’ve confirmed that it works. If you’ve jailbroken your device with the TaiG 2.0 tool yesterday or earlier today, you can use a simple .deb file install to fix Cydia Substrate in just a few minutes.
* In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to install the TaiG 8.3 Untether .deb on your jailbroken iOS 8.3 device and fix Cydia Substrate.
* Note: TaiG has warned users not to use this release, as it is still in testing. Proceed at your own risk.
* Note: Your device must already be jailbroken with the TaiG 2.0 tool.
* Step 1: Install iFile from Cydia
* Step 2: Force close Cydia
* Step 3: On your iOS 8.3 device, go to our download page
* Step 4: Tap the TaiG 8.3 Untether.deb download
* Step 5: Tap open in iFile
* Step 6: Tap Install
* Step 7: Reboot your device after the install completes
* That’s all there is to it. Now go enjoy all of the compatible jailbreak apps and tweaks that rely on Cydia Substrate! We’ll be back with a full tutorial for the TaiG 2.1 jailbreak tool for Windows a bit later.
