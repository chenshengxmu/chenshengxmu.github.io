* Cydia was recently updated with a new user interface for iOS 7, but still has the same logo that dates back to the days of iPhoneOS 2.0. Thankfully, there is a rather simple method that can be followed to replace the current Cydia logo with one that has a more flat or modern design. Those interested can find step-by-step instructions ahead… 
* The first step is to tap on Cydia and install iFile, a jailbreak application that allows you to access and make changes to the iOS filesystem. You’ll then want to visit this article from an iOS device, tap on one of the Cydia logos in the gallery below and save it to Camera Roll. Further icons are available on deviantART and Reddit.
* Next, tap on iFile and follow these instructions:
* Step 1: Navigate to /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE to find the logo you just saved. It should be near the bottom of the list.
* Step 2: Tap on Edit in the top menu, select the logo, tap the clipboard icon in the bottom menu and select Copy/Link.
* Step 3: Navigate to /Applications/Cydia.app.
* Step 4: Tap on Edit in the top menu, followed by the clipboard icon, and select Paste.
* Step 5: Find icon@2x.png in the same folder, tap the blue arrow icon to the right of it and rename the file to something similar. Tap Done when finished.
* Step 6: Rename the logo you pasted to icon@2x.png by tapping the blue arrow icon to the right of it. Tap Done when finished.
* Step 7: Respring or restart your device.
* These same steps can be followed to change the logo of other applications if you wish. But, as I have noted in the past, it is important to be aware that any manual modifications made to the iOS filesystem could cause issues. As such, it is highly recommended that you backup your device to iTunes or iCloud beforehand. Let us know how you fare in the comments.
