* If you want a more powerful App Switcher, then perhaps a good place to start is with a new jailbreak tweak called SwitcherControls by iOS developer DGh0st.
* Immediately reminiscent of the multi-center feature from a prior jailbreak tweak release known as Auxo 3, SwitcherControls combines both the App Switcher and Control Center interfaces into one, yielding what you see above.
* The interface is laden with shortcuts; by default, the top gets you to your flashlight, timer, calculator, and camera, while the bottom consists of your toggles for Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb, and Rotation Lock. You can also swipe up on the grabber on the bottom section to reveal more controls, including Night Shift, AirPlay mirroring, and AirDrop receiving.
* Whenever you’re playing music, the tweak will automatically display the Now Playing interface so you can control your playback:

* Just as you would in the normal App Switcher, you can swipe up on application cards to force-quit apps; nothing has changed there. On the other hand, you will soon learn that all of the interface is completely customizable…
* SwitcherControls adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you’ll be able to configure the look and feel:

* From the main preferences pane, you can toggle the tweak on or off and respring you save your changes. You can also access two different cells: Section Layout and Advanced Options.
* From the Section Layout pane, you can configure the following options:

* Your options include:
* From the Advanced Options pane, you can configure the following options:

* That about wraps things up for the tweak’s configuration, and as you can see, there’s an extensive list of options; enough to satisfy almost anyone.
* SwitcherControls is probably one of my favorite App Switcher mods for jailbroken iOS 10 devices to date, and if you’re interested in giving it a try for yourself, it can be downloaded for $1.50 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* As a side note, don’t forget to pair this tweak with Kaze for a more complete Auxo-like experience on iOS 10.
