* In case you missed this little yet important detail in an avalanche of web reports about the Apple Watch Series 2, Apple’s second-generation wearable packs in a few handful improvements, among which is what appears to be a second microphone opening. As the original Apple Watch had a single tiny microphone hole, it couldn’t suppress background noise.
* In turn, the “Hey Siri” function on the original watch behaves somewhat erratically, struggling to recognize the command in noisy environments.
* Wait, does that mean that the Apple Watch Series 2 should respond to the “Hey Siri” hot phrase more reliably than before? It’s complicated…
* Probably not because a new microphone opening along with a redesigned speaker system lets Series 2 reduce pressure when it’s underwater, according to Apple’s iPhone 7 keynote. An additional real microphone would be needed on top of the existing one to improve “Hey Siri” accuracy and reliability through background noise cancellation.
* Perhaps Apple engineers have added another hole for the microphone simply to let more sound waves in—that would be the cheapest way of improving Siri reception.
* Confusingly enough, AppAdvice states that Apple has added a second mic to the watch.
* “This should help a lot with ‘Hey Siri’”, the site speculated.
* Apple’s official technical specifications for the Apple Watch Series 2 don’t event mention any microphone, or the speaker for that matter, so there’s that.
* The Apple Watch Series 2 packs in a built-in GPS for tracking runs without an iPhone, a two times brighter display, an in-house designed second-generation “S2” chip with two CPU cores and faster graphics and more. It’s also more water resistant than the previous generation and tracks swimming.
* Does that new mic opening on the side of Series 2 house a second microphone? In my view, were Apple to really add another on-board microphone I’m sure it wouldn’t pass up on a golden opportunity to brag about improved “Hey Siri” reception.
* The truth is, we simply won’t know until repair experts over at iFixit perform their ritual teardown dance after the new watches arrive on September 16.
* Until then, feel free to tell us in comments what you think could be going on here and whether or not there’s a second mic in Series 2 to improve “Hey Siri” reception.
* You can pre-order your Series 2 from Apple ahead of September 16 retail availability.
