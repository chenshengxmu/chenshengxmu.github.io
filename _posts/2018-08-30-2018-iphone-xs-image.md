* Just hours after Apple announced it would be holding its fall event on Sept. 12, 9to5Mac has published what it claims is the first official image that shows two of the three new iPhones the company is expected to announce on that date. The site also claims the two new handsets have the name iPhone XS.
* As you can see in the image above, what we’re likely seeing is the long-rumored second-generation OLED 5.8-inch iPhone X sitting atop an all-new OLED 6.5-inch model. A 6.1-inch LCD iPhone is also expected to make its debut in less than two weeks.
* In its Thursday post, 9to5Mac claims both of the OLED phones will be available in a new gold option, which was never offered on the 2017 iPhone X.
* Other details are still to be determined, but we can report with certainty that iPhone XS will be the name, the OLED model will come in two sizes including a larger version, and each will be offered in gold for the first time.
* There’s no reason to believe 9to5Mac’s claims are inaccurate.
* The leaked image falls in line with previous rumors that said Apple was planning to keep the basic look of the iPhone X for this year’s lineup. All three new iPhones are expected to feature Face ID on a near bezel-less front and include a glass back. While the OLED models are expected to include stainless steel on the sides, the less-expensive LCD model is likely to have sides made of aluminum.
* Between now and Sept. 12 we should expect more leaks like the one mentioned here.
* As a reminder, Apple’s fall event is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. PDT on Wednesday, Sept. 12 and it will be live-streamed. Besides new iPhones, the event is likely to feature the arrival of two new iPad Pro tablets and the fourth-generation Apple Watch. New Macs are also possible.
* What do you think of this leak? Let us know below.
