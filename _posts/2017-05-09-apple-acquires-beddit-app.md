* Apple has acquired sleep tracking startup Beddit. The company updated its privacy policy on its website Tuesday to announce the acquisition, saying “your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.”
* Beddit developed both software and hardware for monitoring sleep patterns. Its latest product, the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, features a soft sensor that’s placed under your bed sheets to analyze sleep-related data. It’s $150 and available on Apple’s website.
* The technology it uses is based upon ballistocardiography (BCG), an unobtrusive, noninvasive technique for measuring the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs and other body functions. It then transmits the data it collects to your iPhone and Apple Watch.
* There’s no word yet on the terms of the deal, or what Apple plans to do with Beddit’s products and software, but it’s not hard to imagine them integrating the tech into future products. The current Apple Watch does not feature a stock sleep tracking feature.
