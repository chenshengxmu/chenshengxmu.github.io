* Speaking of the unicorn white iPhone 4, a new official document by Apple shows that it might still launch in the Spring of 2011, as previously stated by the company. 9 to 5 Mac revealed yesterday some of the new signage you can see in Apple Stores around the country, clearly stating “the white iPhone 4 will be available Spring 2011”.
* At this point, I personally don’t believe we’ll ever get a white iPhone 4 at all. I might be wrong but I don’t see Apple releasing it just months before announcing the iPhone 5. I guess time will tell…
* Do you believe Apple will stick to its words and have a white iPhone 5 for next Spring?
