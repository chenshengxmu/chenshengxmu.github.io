* Spectacles, a pair of camera glasses developed and manufactured by Snapchat, are no longer exclusively distributed via the company’s pop-up vending machines, called Snapbots. Today, Spectacles became available for purchase online, CNET reported Monday. Available in three vivid colors and expected to ship in 2-4 weeks, the $130 Google Glass-like accessory is now available online via spectacles.com.
* Snapchat’s hip video sunglasses include a built-in battery and camera lens with a 115-degree field of view. As soon as you press a button on the top, Spectacles start recording video up to a maximum of ten seconds. The device automatically synchronizes recorded clips with your smartphone via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
* LED lights on the glasses light up during video capture. The videos taken on the glasses can be individually uploaded in the Memories section of Snapchat.

* The pair of glasses ship with a charging case that has a built-in battery similar to Apple’s AirPods charging case. The fully-charged case will hold enough power to recharge the glasses four times, according to Snapchat. TechCrunch said that extra cases ($50) and ($10) are now being removed from Amazon.

* A Snapchat spokesperson has confirmed that its New York City store has been shuttered recently, adding that the firm’s vending machines will soon begin to crop up in the US after a short “nap”. Spectacles are paired with a smartphone by looking at your account Snapcode. A quick press of the button on the glasses frame then pairs the accessory with your iOS device via Bluetooth.
* Spectacles cost $130 and come in three color options: Coral, Black and Teal.
* You can order yours online at spectacles.com. The smart glasses are compatible with any iPhone model with iOS 8 or later, from iPhone 5 onward. According to Snapchat, iPhone SE owners must update to iOS 10 to avoid issues with pairing.
