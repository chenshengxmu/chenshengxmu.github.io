* Nokia’s got it all figured out. See, youths don’t really want to buy an iPhone, it’s just so boring. Android isn’t quite what buyers are looking for, either. Teens just don’t understand what Google has put in front of them. How could they?
* Those are the views of outspoken Nokia director of Portfolio, Product Marketing & Sales Niels Munksgaard in an interview with Pocket-Lint. Apparently, he even managed to say it with a straight face!
* According to Nokia’s man, what do you think is the ideal platform for the youth of today? Windows Phone 7, of course!
* “What we see is that youth are pretty much fed up with iPhones. Everyone has the iPhone,” he said. “Also, many are not happy with the complexity of Android and the lack of security. So we do increasing see that the youth that wants to be on the cutting edge and try something new are turning to the Windows phone platform.”
* We are all for Nokia execs pimping their own devices — it’s what they get paid to do. We are even fine with them suggesting that youths — Nokia doesn’t want old people to buy its phones, apparently — should drop cash for a Windows Phone 7 device. What we’re not so sure about is Munksgaard’s opinion that the iPhone is boring.
* Do the iPhone 4S sales figures suggest that people are bored? Not really.
* We suspect that people are not bored with Windows Phone 7 because nobody actually bought one in the first place.
