* Twitterrific by Iconfactory, a third-party Twitter client for the iPhone and iPad, has received an update Tuesday evening enabling extension support for AgileBits’ 1Password via Twitterrific’s in-app browser, in addition to taking advantage of the bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens.
* This version also includes more than a dozen bug fixes, improvements and enhancements. The 8.6-megabyte download is available free of charge in the App Store, with advanced features locked behind several In-App Purchases.
* Again, the new version also enables native support for the larger displays of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.
* Originally announced by both Iconfactory and 1Password developer AgileBits three weeks ago, integration with 1Password’s proprietary extension (not to be confused with third-party App Extensions in iOS 8) allows the app to use your passwords stored in 1Password to authorize you into websites accessed in Twitterrific’s built-in browser.
* As depicted on the screenshots top of post, websites like Instagram and Vine can now be accessed without switching applications like before.
* If you’re going to update your copy of Twitterrific to the latest available version (5.7.6), keep in mind that the update removes support for the once popular Twitpic image upload service.
* This doesn’t come as a surprise knowing that Twitpic itself recently announced plans to shut down its service following a trademark dispute with Twitter.
* In response, Twitter in a statement to Re-code said it was “sad to see” Twitpic go.
* Twitterrific 5.7.6 changelog:
* Twitterrific back in April received an interesting new feature allowing you to edit tweets after they’ve been published, with a caveat.
* The month before, Iconfactory decided to make its stylish app a freemium download, with several advanced features available through In-App Purchases.
* Twitter’s own iPhone and iPad app was updated last week with revamped profile pages and support for Interactive Notifications in iOS 8.
* [App Store]
