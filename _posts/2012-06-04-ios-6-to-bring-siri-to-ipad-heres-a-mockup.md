* Much as it has been speculated, Apple is apparently working to enable Siri on iPad by way of iOS 6, according to the inevitable people familiar with the matter. We’re talking about full-blown voice assistant, not just the Dictation feature, and it will reportedly work just as you’d expect it to. Here’s a mockup based on the description provided by the source…
* The mockup is credited to 9to5Mac, whose Mark Gurman observed:
* Unlike on the iPhone 4S, Siri for iPad is not a full screen experience. This makes sense given the device’s larger, 9.7-inch display. Siri on the iPad is activated by a quick hold of the home button, just like on the iPhone 4S. The interface slides up from below the display with a clever animation.
* So, rather than taking up the entire screen, a smaller window containing Siri output will be overlaid on top of  anything you might be working on, similar to the Notification Center window.
* Siri is built into the iPad as a small window on top of whatever interface the user is currently interacting with. This Siri window with rounded corners sits at the bottom center of the display, as you can see in our mockup above.
* The Siri iPad interface takes very little space over the iPad interface currently in use, and is designed with the same linen texture as on the iPhone 4S. Siri for iPad also works from the lock screen.
* Phone-specific features won’t be supported on the iPad.
* Everything else is a go-go, including Music playback, iMessaging, Calendar managing, Reminders, Weather, Maps integration, E-mailing, Notes, Contacts searching, Safari integration, Wolfram-Alpha searching, and other Siri features.
* That sounds just about right to us.
* Though Apple is said to have been testing the feature on both the second- and third-generation iPad, “it is unconfirmed” that Siri will launch as an iPad 3 exclusive, allegedly in order to reduce strain on servers.
* iOS 6 is also said to bring third-party apps support for Siri, in addition to system-wide Facebook integration, certain new features from OS X Mountain Lion, the enhanced Maps app with mind-boggling 3D mode, major ehnancements to stock apps across the board and much more.
* Thoughts?
