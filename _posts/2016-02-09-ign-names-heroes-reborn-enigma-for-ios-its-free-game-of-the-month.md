* IGN has named Phosphor Games Studio’s first person action-puzzle game Heroes Reborn: Enigma its free title for the month of February 2016, marking the first time the $4.99 game has gone free since its October 2015 debut.
* The game has you playing as Dahlia, an evolved human with incredible powers. You must solve various puzzles and survive tests in order to escape captivity at The Quarry, a secret government facility.
* You shall harness your powers of time shifting, telekinesis and time manipulation to survive the challenges. “It will take real skill to escape where you are being held hostage and save your sister,“ reads the description.
* Here’s the official trailer for Heroes Reborn: Enigma.
* Enigma packs in over 30 levels and continually evolves as your powers and abilities increase throughout the game. Phosphor Games, the team behind Heroes Reborn: Enigma, has also created other triple-A mobile titles such as Horn and A Dark Meadow.
