* If you’re looking to buy a low-cost iPhone, you’re probably going to want to wait until the so-called iPhone SE 2 is released later this year. Unfortunately, the current iPhone SE 2 rumors remain all over the place, suggesting the new device isn’t being launched next month during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).
* The latest word about Apple’s next entry-level handset comes from the Japanese blog Mac Otakara. According to Chinese accessory makers, the second-generation iPhone SE isn’t even being produced yet, as Apple struggles to determine which final design to use.
* The blog explains the remaining iPhone SE 2 prototypes include at least one design that looks like the iPhone X with a full screen and notch, but no home button. Other final models, however, are more in line with the current look, which is similar to the iPhone 5 series design.
* Just days ago, footage posted on Chinese social media suggested the second-generation iPhone SE may feature an all-glass back and 3.5mm headphone jack. Previously, Mac Otakara said the next 4-inch model would come with an A10 Fusion chip, Touch ID, but no headphone jack.
* The bottom line: no one outside of Apple seems to know what the iPhone SE 2 will look like. Because of this, the likelihood of the device being announced in just a few weeks in time for WWDC seems increasingly remote. If the device isn’t announced next month, it will likely launch in September alongside the other 2018 iPhones.
* This Fall, Apple’s expected to announce a second-generation iPhone X, 6.5-inch “iPhone Plus,” and 6.1-inch LCD model.
* Hopefully, the iPhone SE 2 rumors will get closer to each other very soon. In the meantime, let us know which new iPhone model you’d like to buy this year? Leave your comment below.
