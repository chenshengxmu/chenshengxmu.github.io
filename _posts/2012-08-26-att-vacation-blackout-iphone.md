* Apple has yet to make any kind of official announcement regarding when the next iPhone will be unveiled and become available, but we’re almost positive we know the dates. Apple is expected to debut the handset on September 12, and launch it in stores on September 21.
* There’s already a mountain of evidence in favor of this timeline, such as reports from multiple credible sources and news outlets, and blacked out vacation dates for Verizon employees. But in case you needed any more proof, AT&T employees have just thrown their hats into the ring…
* TechCrunch reports:
* “According to an AT&T sales rep, AT&T staff has just been given a vacation blackout from September 21 to September 30, just like Verizon employees. Our source also mentioned that blue carrier employees are undergoing training for an “iconic release.”
* Sounds like the next-gen iPhone to me.”
* Of course, there are a number of new devices scheduled to be unveiled in the first week of September, so it’s possible that this is something else, and not iPhone-related.
* But the fact that these dates match up perfectly with Verizon’s reported blackout, suggests that whatever the device is will be launching on both carriers at the same time.
* So if it’s not the iPhone, what else could it be?
