* Apple on Wednesday shared a new iPhone 6s ad on its YouTube page called ‘Timer.’ The spot stars the popular Sesame Street character Cookie Monster, and is set in a kitchen where he is baking—you guessed it—cookies.
* With a humorous tone, the commercial demonstrates the hands-free ‘Hey Siri’ feature on Apple’s iPhone 6s. Cookie Monster uses it to accomplish a variety of tasks, including setting a kitchen timer and playing a music playlist.

* Apple has enlisted the help of several celebrities in recent advertisements, including hip-hop artist Killer Mike of Run the Jewels, actress Aubrey Plaza, actors Bill Hader and Jamie Foxx, and pro basketball player Steph Curry.
* What do you think of the new ad?
