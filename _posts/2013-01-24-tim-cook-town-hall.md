* Following up on yesterday’s record fiscal 2013 first-quarter earnings release (which, unsurprisingly, has failed to impress Wall Street), Apple CEO Tim Cook issued an email to employees last night. The internal communiqué congratulates employees on their performance as Cook thanks everyone on their “incredible hard work and focus” that has resulted in 75 million iDevice sales during the holiday quarter.
* He also announced Apple will be holding a Town Hall meeting today at 10am Pacific time and invited employees to submit questions via AppleWeb. Cook, like his predecessor Steve Jobs, holds Q&A sessions with employees following quarterly earnings to discuss business, strategy and the future. We’ll be keeping a close eye on today’s meeting to fill you in with interesting tidbits throughout the day…
* According to email communication obtained by 9to5Mac, Cook wrote:
* Team,
* We’ve just reported another record setting quarter, thanks to everyone’s incredible hard work and focus. We sold over 75 million iOS devices in the holiday quarter alone, which is a testament to the strength of Apple’s innovation.
* Please join me for an employee communications meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. Pacific time in the auditorium of De Anza 3.
* We’ve created a space on AppleWeb where you can submit your questions in advance, and we’ll do our best to answer as many of them as we can during the meeting.
* The meeting will be broadcast live throughout Cupertino and at many other Apple locations. Please check AppleWeb for details.
