* Do you remember playing the old-school Snake from Nokia phones? First released in the late 1990s on the Nokia 6110, this innovative, all-consuming game with monochrome graphics and stupendously simple concept of not crashing the snake while trying to eat fruit is a testament of timeless design. Now Snake’s original creator Taneli Armanto has teamed up with Rumilus Design to bring back the joy of the classic game in a modern take on Snake.
* Titled Snake Rewind, the game is scheduled to hit iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms globally on next Thursday, May 14, 2015.
* “Snake Rewind takes the iconic elements and intuitive gameplay from the original Snake game and combines them with cool visual effects, sounds and great new features,” reads the blurb.
* While keeping most of the original game’s concept intact, Snake Rewind features updated graphics and visual effects, new music, ten brand new levels, new fruits with special power-ups and more.

* Perhaps most interestingly, you will be able to rewind the Snake, which will cost you points you must gather while playing the game.
* Here’s a quick video preview of Snake Rewind.
* Snake Rewing highlights:
* It’s also nice that Snake Rewind features Game Center leaderboards, achievements and multiplayer functionality, so you’ll be able to compete against other players.
* What more could a die-hard fan of retro gaming ask for?
