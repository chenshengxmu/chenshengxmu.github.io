* Bummer. Apple has officially stated that it will not be streaming tomorrow’s “Let’s Talk iPhone” event, according to 9to5Mac.
* Apple streamed live video of last year’s September event, but no such luck this year. UK journalists will get a private stream at the Covent Garden Apple Store in London.
* The event will take place tomorrow at 10am PT, or 1pm ET (see what time the event will happen in your country). Apple deciding not to steam video doesn’t mean that the event won’t be available to download in podcast form on iTunes afterwards. The recording will likely be made available on Apple’s website and in iTunes a day or two after the event.
* This also doesn’t mean that you can’t stay on top of the event as it happens! Keep your browser locked to iDownloadBlog for breaking news during the keynote.
