* If you are in the market for a Bluetooth keyboard, there are plenty to keep you guessing. However, I am yet to find a model that collapses into a small portable unit for grab-and-go solutions. Today, Jorno utilizes the small, compact design you may be looking to discover and is launching on Kickstarter.
* At 3.5″x3.5″x1.2″ folded, the Jorno promises to fit in any travel bag or even a back pocket. With a 2011 Design and Engineering Showcase Honors from International CES, it should raise a few eyebrows as it makes its way around the net…
* At its core, Jorno is an attempt to solve the tactical woes of all virtual keyboard devices. The Bluetooth keyboard helps the user more easily enter data through a small mobile device or tablet. Jorno stands out because the foldable portability does not restrict the user with a bulky interface and even cradles an iPhone or iPad.
* The built in rechargeable battery uses an included micro USB cable and offers 30 days of “normal” usage, but it is safe to say, this will vary per user.

* I used a similar device around 10 years ago with a small PDA. It was handy during meetings and quick on-the-go email sessions in a coffee shop or car. Designed with mobile power users in mind, make sure to support Jorno on Kickstarter, where you can nab one at a starting pledge of $79. Actual retail is $119 and initial early bird prices are limited to the first 500 backers.
* Are you a fan of tactile keyboards and, if so, would be willing to carry one around in your pocket?
