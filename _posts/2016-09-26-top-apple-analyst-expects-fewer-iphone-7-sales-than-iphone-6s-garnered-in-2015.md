* Despite Note 7 fires and carriers suggesting iPhone 7 sellouts, top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities isn’t entirely convinced that strong consumer demand will offset slowing shipments. In a note to clients obtained by AppleInsider, Kuo predicted 70-75 million iPhone 7 sales in 2016—lower than that of the iPhone 6s in 2015.
* Kuo cautions that strong iPhone 7 sales are not “not entirely due to market demand” because carrier promotions inflated sales numbers and a larger amount of launch countries led to depleted inventories worldwide.
* Both new iPhone 7 models launched in 28 countries versus 12 launch markets for the iPhone 6s lats September.
* After conducting a survey, Kuo concluded that Jet Black is the most popular colorway accounting for 30 to 35 percent of preorders globally. In China, Jet Black iPhone 7 models accounted for 45 to 50 percent of preorders. In terms of storage, the 128GB model is currently consumers’ #1 choice.
* The dual-camera feature in the iPhone 7 Plus has helped boost early shipments, he said.
* Scarcity of Jet Black iPhones is due to challenges related to complex manufacturing processes required to give these phones their superior polish and shine. Specifically, a yield rate for Jet Black iPhones is currently about 60 to 70 percent.
* T-Mobile CEO John Legere said that iPhone 7 preorders up to September 12 had been “like four times bigger than the iPhone 6.” In a curious reversal of its longstanding practice, Apple has declined to publicize opening weekend iPhone 7 sales.
