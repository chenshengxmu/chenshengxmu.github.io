* Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claims Apple may call the next line of its iPhone the “iPhone 7”, instead of the “iPhone 6s” like previously thought. The name change will be because of significant changes to the iOS user interface, including Force Touch technology for better interaction, the analyst says.
* The Force Touch technology will be different from what’s found on the Apple Watch and MacBook trackpad: “We believe that iPhone’s Force Touch sensor doesn’t directly detect the pressure applied by fingers,” Kuo said. “Instead, it monitors the contact area on which the finger touches the screen to decide how big the pressure is.”
* As such, Kuo believes the company will implement Force Touch on the next iPhone by using capacitive technology, and placing the sensor under the in-cell touch panel’s backlight.
* AppleInsider first reported the next line of iPhones will include Force Touch, with the Wall Street Journal further backing up the claim and added that it could detect between light and deep taps.
* Kuo also adds the 4-inch iPhone “6c” that’s been leaked over the past month won’t see its place on shelves in 2015.
