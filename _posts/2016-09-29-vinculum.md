* Vinculum is a new jailbreak tweak that brings to jailbroken iOS devices an app drawer inspired by Android 7.0 Nougat on the Google Nexus phones.
* Not only can you use this app drawer to get to any of your apps in a pinch, but you can even customize the way it looks to get the appearance you’re going for.
* After you install Vinculum, you will notice a new grabber at the top of your Dock. Dragging up on the grabber is what opens the Vinculum interface.

* At the top of the interface, you will find a search bar so you can quickly search for any app on your device and launch it with a tap. Vinculum lists all your apps in alphabetical order, even those in folders, by default.
* By going to Settings → Vinculum, you can configure the tweak to your desired preferences. One of the most important things you can do here is choose what apps appear in the Vinculum interface.

* Apps that are turned off will appear, while apps that are turned on are going to be hidden from the app drawer. A button at the top of the list labeled “Unhide all apps” will make all your apps appear in the app drawer, even if you have some hidden.
* There are also plenty of options to change around Vinculum’s UI a bit, such as enabling or disabling the search bar, hiding or showing the app icon labels, changing up the size and spacing of the app icons, and choosing between a light or dark menu.
* At a first glance, the tweak doesn’t really do anything you can’t already accomplish from the Home screen or Spotlight, but what you get is the novelty experience of a Nexus 7.0 Nougat-like app drawer, which is something not every iPhone owner has. Whether or not the bragging rights are worth it to you remains to be seen,  but only you can make that decision.
* If you’re interested in trying out Vinculum, you can download it onto your jailbroken device from Cydia’s ModMyi repository for $0.99.
* Note: AppList is a required dependency, but is not installed by default. You will need to install this package manually from Cydia if you do not already have it for Vinculum to work correctly.
