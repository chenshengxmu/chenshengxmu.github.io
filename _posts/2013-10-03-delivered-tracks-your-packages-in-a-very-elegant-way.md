* Imagine the scene. Your iPhone 5s has finally shipped from China and Apple has generated a UPS or FedEx tracking code for you. Of course, you eagerly refresh the courier’s website to find out where exactly your precious currently is. If your like me, and I’ll assume you are, you’ll probably track the package a dozen times a day until it’s there.
* What if I told you there is a completely free and elegant way to do just that directly from your iPhone? Even better, what if it came with push notifications to let you know about every step of the delivery? That’s exactly what Delivered! does…
* The free version of the app allows you to add up to two packages to track from one of the 15 or so couriers the app supports. Major couriers such as UPS, FedEx, DHL, and USPS are supported, and if you’re in the US, that’s pretty much all you need.
* If you want to be able to track more than two packages at the time, you will have to unlock the Pro Account via a $1.99 in-app purchase. I don’t know about you, but I rarely, if ever, have to track more than two packages at a time, so the free version is just fine for my needs.
* Delivery! is elegantly designed with iOS 7 in mind. It is clean, simple, and free of any unnecessary clutter. If I had my ways about the design of the app though, I’d definitely remove the blue, white, and red stripes at the top of the screen. I understand what the developer is trying to bring with these design elements, but I don’t think they beautify the app in any ways. Quite the opposite actually.
* Maybe the best feature about this app is that you can receive push notifications as your package goes from one delivery center to another, all the way to your front door. You can choose to receive notifications for every step of the delivery, or simply for when the package is out for delivery or delivered.
* As mentioned above, Delivered! is free with a $1.99 in-app purchase to be able to track more than two packages. It is a universal app with iCloud syncing support so you can start tracking a package on your iPhone and pick up the tracking later on your iPad.
* You can download Delivered! in the App Store today.
