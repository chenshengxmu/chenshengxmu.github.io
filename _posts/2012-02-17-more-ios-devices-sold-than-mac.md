* We don’t really need more proof that the iPhone and iPad are a success, but every now and then we still like to be reminded of it. This time, it’s Horace Dediu from Asymco that shares some incredible stats about the success of iOS.
* To put things into perspective, Dediu created a graph that shows the cumulative sales of Apple computing products over the years since their launch. The conclusion is just breathtaking. More iOS devices were sold in 2011 than all the Macs ever sold…
* Apple sold 156 million iOS devices in 2011, reaching 316 million cumulative iOS units ever sold. In comparison, it took the company 28 years to sell 122 million Macs. Unbelievable.
