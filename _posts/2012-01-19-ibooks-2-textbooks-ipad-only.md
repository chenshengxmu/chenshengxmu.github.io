* For those of you wondering whether or not iBooks 2 works on the iPhone or iPod touch, the answer is yes, with a catch.
* You can update your current app to iBooks 2.0, but you still cannot download textbooks without an iPad. We also advise jailbreakers to stay away from the latest iBooks update…
* Considering how vast the design scope is for the textbooks, that’s fully understandable, but we thought you would like to know, that indeed, at this point it is not possible.
* As far as we can tell, outside of the textbook features, there’s not any other improvements to iBooks 2 over its predecessor.
* For that reason, if you have an iPhone, especially a jailbroken iPhone, we advise you to stay on your current version, because we’ve heard rumblings that it breaks the Corona update, but have yet been able to independently confirm that.
* Are you disappointed that textbooks are iPad only, or do you think it makes sense?
* Update: Apparently a reboot will fix the iBooks issue on a jailbroken iPhone using the latest version of Corona.
