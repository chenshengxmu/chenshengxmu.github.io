* The Financial Times ran a paywall’d story Monday, in which it reported that Apple is “stepping up” its augmented reality efforts across the company, especially in augmented reality eyewear, with the ultimate goal of releasing a consumer-facing accessory. Augmented reality is now reportedly the most important development project within Apple, after iPhone.
* The report notes that both Apple with its yet-to-be-announced product and Facebook with its tethered Oculus headset are gearing up to challenge the secretive Florida-based startup Magic Leap and Microsoft, which more than two years ago debuted its praised augmented reality accessory, called HoloLens.
* Citing people with knowledge of the plans, the report states that Apple a year ago began assembling a team of experts to tackle augmented reality. They’re now devoting more resources to augmented-reality efforts and a rumored head-worn device.
* Ultimately, Apple wants to take it from a science project towards a consumer product.
* “Any launch is still at least a year away, perhaps much longer,” reads the report.
* Augmented reality seems to have emerged as the top new project beyond iPhone, overtaking even the Cupertino company’s secretive car project.
* According to Apple’s boss Tim Cook, augmented reality may “take a little while” to arrive, but “we will wonder, when it does, how we lived without it.”
* “Kind of how we wonder how we lived without our phones today,” he said.
* At the same time, Facebook is researching the technology that can make what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls “glasses small enough to take anywhere”.
* MagicLeap, the secretive Florida-based company, recently raised a whopping $1.4 billion from investors including Alphabet and Alibaba. The startup is planning to release its long-awaited augmented reality eyewear later this year.
* Smaller than Microsoft’s HoloLens with a wider field of view, the MagicLeap device will be reportedly larger than a regular pair of glasses.
* “The headgear will be tethered to a small pack that provides battery and processing power, to put in a pocket or attach to a belt,” the newspaper has learned.
* That device is likely to cost in excess of $1,000.
