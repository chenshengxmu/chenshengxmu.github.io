* Between its 8MP sensor and internet connectivity, the iPhone 4S is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras around. It can download thousands of photo-editing apps and upload images to a number of services.
* But the lack of interchangeable lenses, a weak flash, and other missing features means that the iPhone won’t be replacing your DSLR anytime soon. Unless, of course, you had something like the 3RDi camera kit…
* The 3RDi Kit, from Knight Vision Studio, is a full-on camera kit for the iPhone 4 and 4S. It includes a Wide-angle lens, a Fisheye lens, a Polarizer filter, an ND filter, a Lens Grip, and a case for your handset.
* All of these things come together to dramatically enhance your iPhone’s picture-taking abilities. The Wide-angle lens adds depth to your photos, the Polarizer filter deepens colors, and the case holds it all together. As a bonus, the Lens grip has a built-in cold shoe mount, allowing you to connect an external flash or other accessory.
* As you might have guessed by now, the 3RDi Kit is currently only available via Kickstarter. To get one, you’d have to pledge $135 or more, and hope that the team hits its lofty goal of $150,000 by August 19th.
* And for those of you who want to improve their iPhone picture-taking skills without ponying up $130, be sure to check out our ongoing iPhoneography series. It’s full of tips and tricks for getting the most out of your iPhone pics, and is written by a real photographer.
* What do you think of the 3RDi kit? Would you buy one?
