* It’s taken a while, but Apple has finally uploaded this year’s WWDC keynote to YouTube. The replay has been available as an embedded video on Apple’s website since yesterday, but obviously YouTube is a lot more device-friendly.
* So for the folks who missed the keynote, or would just like to watch it again, things have just gotten much easier. You can now view it in its entirety in YouTube’s desktop or mobile web app, or via the native mobile YouTube app.
* It really was a great keynote. The pace was good, the presentations were polished, and of course we got some great sneak peeks at upcoming updates for the iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS platforms. If you haven’t watched it yet, you should.
