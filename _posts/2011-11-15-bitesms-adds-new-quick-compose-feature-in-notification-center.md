* The latest version of biteSMS is shaping up to be something special. The team has worked hard for months, issuing beta after beta to get version 6 of our favorite jailbreak messaging client just right for iOS 5.
* We already covered some of biteSMS’ upcoming new features before, but this time around we’re focusing exclusively on one feature in particular — quick compose from Notification Center.
* IntelliScreenX has it, and now the biteSMS team has it as well. Check inside for a full video walkthrough of the new quick compose elements of biteSMS…
* As you can see, the quick compose in biteSMS looks extremely similar to that of IntelliScreenX, which is a great thing since IntelliScreenX looks awesome in itself.
* The biteSMS team says that version 6.0.15 of the beta — the version featured in the video — is close to final and pretty stable. Hopefully we can expect an official release in the coming weeks.
* If you want to try out the beta version for yourself, simply add the following repo address to your Cydia sources: http://cydia.bitesms.com
