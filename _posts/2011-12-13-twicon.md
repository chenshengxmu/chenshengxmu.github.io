* As if there weren’t already plenty of options to invoke iOS 5’s native Twitter integration. This time, the method is by means of a handy app icon conveniently placed on your iOS device’s Home screen.
* We already have standalone shortcuts, Activator options, and now Twicon — a standalone app icon that acts a shortcut directly to iOS 5’s Twitter popup panel…
* The thoughts over on our YouTube channel are pretty polarizing. Lots of viewers think this may be the most useless idea for a tweak in some time, especially considering the alternative options available. What say you?
