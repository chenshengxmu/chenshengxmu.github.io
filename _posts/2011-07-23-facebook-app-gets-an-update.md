* The Facebook app for iOS just got an update. We usually don’t post about app updates, but as the most popular iPhone app, I felt like we had to let you guys know.
* As usual, this update contains a bunch of bug fixes that caused the app to crash. Additionally, this update restored the Send button for comments, chat, and messages. It also restored the friend lists to the News Feed filter…
* If you want to get this update, fire up the App Store app on your iPhone and check for updates.
* Oh, and by the way, where is my Facebook app for iPad? I can’t be the only one wondering where this app is.
