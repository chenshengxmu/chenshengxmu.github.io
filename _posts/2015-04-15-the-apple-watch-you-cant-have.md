* If Apple Watch Edition is out of your league, don’t even start to think about how you could get your hands on this one, because you can’t! This Apple Watch Edition with gold Link bracelet was custom-made for fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld.
* Shared on Instagram by his assistant Sébastien Jondeau, this version goes far beyond anything we had seen so far on celebrities ranging from Pharrell to Katy Perry, who’ve been sporting the “stock” Apple Watch Edition models.
* So why does Karl Lagerfeld get a special treatment? Lagerfeld is a highly regarded and influential man in the world of fashion, and having his implicit endorsement is a big win for Apple who’s been positioning the watch more as a fashion accessory than a tech gadget.
* In the end, it’s not hard to imagine that at some point, Apple may commercialize similar version of the Link bracelet. If anything, it’s even surprising they aren’t any made available yet with Apple Watch Edition.
