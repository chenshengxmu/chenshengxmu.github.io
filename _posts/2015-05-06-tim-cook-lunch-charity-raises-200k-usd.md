* Bidding for the annual Tim Cook lunch auction closed today and the winning bid stands at a cool $200,000, which goes to the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.
* Even though there were more than twenty bids, with the starting bid beginning at $10,000, the fundraiser has actually earned less this year than previous auctions held in 2013 and 2014, probably due to a shift in CharityBuzz’s authentication policy to better prevent false bids.
* The annual auction broke records in 2013 when it raised $610,000 for Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. In 2014, the auction ended at $330,001.
* “As CEO, Cook has overseen the introduction of other innovative new Apple products and services as well, including iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple Pay, as well as the Apple Watch,” reads the press release.
* “He is leading a companywide effort to use 100 percent renewable energy at all Apple facilities, has encouraged his co-workers to give to charitable organizations in their community and started a generous program at Apple to match employee donations.”
* The auction winner, and one additional person of their choosing, will get to enjoy lunch with Cook on Apple’s Cupertino campus scheduled at a mutually agreed upon date, with the cost of lunch being included in the auction price.
* Today’s winner also gets to be Cook’s VIP guest at an Apple keynote event. Travel and accommodations are not included. The prize can’t be resold or re-auctioned.

* Tim Cook’s 2013 auction experience that raised $610,000 remains one of the highest grossing auctions on Charitybuzz.com since the company launched in 2005.
* Other Apple executives have participated in charity fundraisers through CharityBuzz, including Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue and Beats Music’s Ian Rogers.
