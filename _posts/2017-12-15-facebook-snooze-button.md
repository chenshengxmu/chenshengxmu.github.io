* Facebook on Friday announced it’s begun rolling out a brand new Snooze button in users’ News Feed following a period of testing in September.
* Not unlike the Unfollow and Hide options, the Snooze feature makes it easy to mute a friend, page or group for 30 days. To get started, simply choose the new Snooze option from the top-right menu of a post.
* Snoozing a friend temporarily stops their updates without unfollowing or unfriending them permanently. The people, pages and groups you snooze will not be notified.
* If you find friends’ answers to those personality questions introduced a week ago flooding your News Feed, and you’re not interested in them, you can now mute them for a month.
* Facebook will notify you before the snooze period is about to end and the setting can also be reversed at any time.
* This is a staggered release happening over the next week.
* Facebook is a free download from App Store.
