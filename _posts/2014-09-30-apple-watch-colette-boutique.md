* Several photos have appeared on Instagram and Twitter this morning showing the Apple Watch on display at Colette’s boutique on Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris. On Monday it was reported that Apple was planning a joint promotional event with the French retailer.
* More specifically, Colette is now prominently showcasing various models of the Apple Watch in its high profile windows. It has also updated its website announcing that the boutique is inviting people to come preview the wearable device in a special one-day event.
* It’s not known exactly what this special ‘one-day event’ will entail, but it appears the public is going to get its first up-close look at the Apple Watch. Given that it’s Fashion Week in Paris, and Apple is pushing its Watch as a fashion accessory, the move makes sense.

* Also worth noting is that a handful of Apple designers have traveled to Paris this week. Yesterday, industrial design team member Mikael Silvanto posted a photo of himself in the country to Instagram, and it’s believed he’s traveling with Jony Ive and Marc Newson.
* Apple first unveiled the Apple Watch during its September 9 media event, but the device won’t be available until 2015. The Watch will be offered in 3 versions, with the base model starting at $349, and the high-end gold model rumored to cost thousands of dollars.
