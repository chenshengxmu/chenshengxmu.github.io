* Microsoft on Thursday released the official Outlook email client in the App Store (not to be confused with the native Outlook Web App for the iPhone). Optimized for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, the iOS 8-only app is based on Microsoft’s $200 million purchase of the popular mobile email app Acompli.
* Featuring a built-in calendar, comprehensive search features, gesture-based interface akin to Dropbox-owned Mailbox and support for popular cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft’s own OneDrive service, it brings together the core tools you need to get things done in one sweet package.
* Sporting a unified view of your email, calendar, contacts and attachments, the app automatically surfaces your most important messages across all email accounts.
* Check out the promotional video below.
* As you can see, Outlook lets you schedule messages you want to handle later by swiping to delete, archive or perform other actions. Calendaring capabilities make it easy to view your calendar, share available times and schedule meetings.
* When composing messages, the app allows you to attach files from your other emails or files stored in OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive.

* If you read Lory’s review of Acompli for iPhone, you’ll quickly realize that the app resembles the look and feel the Acompli app, which can no longer be found in the App Store.
* Key highlights:
* The 22.5-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later. A preview edition of Outlook is also available on Android phones and tablets.
* A more detailed overview of Outlook for iOS can be found over at Microsoft’s official Office blogs here and here.
* Grab Microsoft Outlook free of charge in the App Store.
