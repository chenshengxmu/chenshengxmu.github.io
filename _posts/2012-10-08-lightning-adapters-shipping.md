* Good news today for folks who ordered, or were thinking about ordering, a Lightning to 30-pin adapter from Apple. Reports are coming in that the first round orders began shipping yesterday.
* As you know, Apple debuted a new charging port in its new iPhone and iPod products last month. And until now, you couldn’t find an adapter that made old accessories work with the new port…
* From MacRumors:
* “MacRumors has received word from several readers located in Australia that their orders are now in transit, with one reader’s shipping notification indicating that his shipment is due to be delivered on October 9.”
* Remember, Apple offers two different Lightning to 30-pin adapters: a direct plug adapter, and then one with a cable that measures about 8-inches. They are priced at $29 and $39 respectively.
* Although the adapters don’t support video output (Apple has confirmed it will be releasing HDMI and VGA Lightning cables), they do still support audio, USB audio, syncing and charging.
* Accessories for the new Lightning connector have been extremely scarce thus far — there’s still no official car chargers — so the fact that these adapters are becoming available is great news.
