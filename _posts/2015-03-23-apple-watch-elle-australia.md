* The Apple Watch tour of the world’s top fashion and lifestyle magazines continues with a fashion debut Down Under in the form of a multi-page style guide in the latest April issue of women magazine Elle Australia.
* The featured article has the publication’s in-house fashion editor Sara Smith sharing tips for making the Watch work in women’s wardrobe.
* Meanwhile, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has chimed in with his thoughts on the device, saying he’ll be opting for an entry-level Apple Watch Sport model.
* Sara Smith explains how the Apple Watch models fit different wardrobes in specific social scenarios such as weekends, cocktail parties, workplace and more.
* If a woman is to go to a cocktail party, she’ll be best served wearing a tuxedo suit and sexy heels. Or, “if you have the legs for it,” a killer cocktail dress, the write-up reads.
* “Mix statement jewels with your Watch,” reads the piece. “Try a fabulous cocktail ring and Cartier’s Love Bracelet would look great sitting side by side with your Apple Watch. It will be the perfect conversation starter at a party.”
* But for the look shown on the images, the article advises coupling the device with “chic tailored separates and martial arts – inspired pieces”.
* “That’s how I styled it for Elle this month,” revealed Elle’s fashion editor. “Everything is belted to give it a karate-inspired edge. Add a pair of sports shoes, no need for jewelry or accessories because the Watch is the hero.”

* Apple has been positioning the Watch as both a fashionable and functional gadget, with several of the world’s top lifestyle and fashion magazines having already featured the device on their covers.
* The publication’s editor-in-chief, Justine Cullen, took time out with Apple in San Francisco to road-test the Watch.
* “I want one,” she said.
* “I’m sad that the Edition version costs US$10K because it’s by far the prettiest, but I’m definitely a fan of the functionalities in the more accessible versions,” Cullen explained.
* “I love the idea of having all the things you need to know – such as your next meeting – on your wrist at a glance.”

* Noting the Watch won’t be a life changing device on the scale of the iPhone, Cullent went on to argue that it is “a fun new piece of arm candy that will look good on your wrist and impress the boys.”
* Then she added that it’s not just about the looks.
* I love the idea of having all the things you need to know – such as your next meeting – on your wrist at a glance. I love that it will prompt me to get up from my desk and move once an hour, and keep track of all my activity.
* And I love that it’ll discreetly tap me on the wrist (no more invasive rings and vibrations) when it wants me to read a message or to tell me I need to be somewhere.
* Meanwhile, legendary Apple c0-founder Steve Wozniak sat down with Australia’s Financial Review and revealed why he’ll be buying the least expensive Apple Watch Sport model.

* “If you buy the really high-priced ones, the jewelry ones, then you’re not buying a smartwatch that has a bunch of apps… Like a Rolex watch, you’re buying if for prestige and a label and a symbol of who you are,” he said.
* As for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition, the Woz is having a hard time grasping the difference between a $10,000 entry-level model and a $17,000 one being only the band.
* “For an engineer like me, I don’t live in that world, that’s not my world,” he said.

* “I’m just not going to buy it for jewelry’s sake until I know it’s something I’m going to want around me and on me and use every single day continually as a permanent part of my life. Then maybe I’d consider looking into getting the nicer jewelry version.”
* The Apple Watch pre-orders kick off on April 10.
* The device will be hitting stores on April 24 in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, starting at $349 for the aluminum Sport edition.
* The higher-tier stainless steel Apple Watch costs between $549 and $1,049 for the smaller 38mm version ($599 – $1,099 for the 42mm variant), depending on your band of choice.
* The 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition starts out at ten grands and goes all the way up to $17,000.
