title: US lawmakers want to look into Google's iPhone tracking fiasco
---
* Last week Google was caught overriding Safari users’ privacy settings, and now US lawmakers want the Federal Trade Commission to probe the company over it, as reported by Computer World:
* Three lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether last week’s report of privacy violations of Safari users by Google violated a consent agreement the company had reached with the FTC last year.
* Google’s alleged circumvention of do-not-track controls on Apple’s Safari browser could have a wide sweeping impact because Safari is a major web browser used by millions of Americans, according to a letter to the FTC on Friday from Republican Representatives Cliff Stearns of Florida and Joe Barton of Texas, and Democrat Edward Markey of Massachusetts.
* That’s definitely something we’ll be following.
