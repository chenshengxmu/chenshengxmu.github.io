* JellyBoard is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that supercharges the editing features on your iPhone’s keyboard. Using swipe gestures, JellyBoard allows you to perform deletions, cut, copy, paste, select all, make uppercase, make lowercase, move the cursor, etc.
* Think of JellyBoard as a tweak that similar to SwipeSelection, but a lot more customizable. There are tons of actions that you can assign to a variety of gestures, and we’ve showcased a few of them in our hands-on video preview inside.
* Seeing as SwipeSelection was one of my favorite jailbreak tweaks of all time, JellyBoard looks really promising. The iPhone and the iPad’s text editing abilities have always been severely lacking in my opinion, and this is one tweak that has the potential to improve that aspect of iOS.
* JellyBoard is still currently in development, but should be making its way to the Cydia store shortly. Once it does, we’ll be back with a more in-depth walkthrough showcasing the tweak’s ins and outs.
* In the meantime, share your thoughts regarding JellyBoard in the comment section below.
