* Want to keep nosey people out of your call history? Then this simple, yet effective jailbreak tweak entitled HiddenCalllog, might be just what the doctor ordered.
* HiddenCalllog makes it easy to quickly disguise yourself as one who has absolutely no friends that care to call you, ever.
* Great for keeping nosey folks out of your call log, perhaps not so great in various other situations…
* To use HiddenCalllog all you have to do is go to your call log, and tap the clear button in the upper right-hand corner. After that, a dialogue box will appear below; tap “refresh” to completely hide the call log; to unhide, simply repeat the process.
* HiddenCalllog is a free jailbreak tweak on the BigBoss repo for jailbroken iPhone owners.
* What do you think? Personally I have no need for a tweak like this, but perhaps some of you do?
