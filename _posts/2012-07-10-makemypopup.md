* Let’s just file this one under the “who in the world would ever find a use for this?” category. MakeMyPopup is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to create your own pop up notifications on the iPhone.
* The problem with MakeMyPopup isn’t that it only allows you to create one singular pop up notification. It isn’t that pop up notifications are ugly, and have all but been replaced by banner notifications. The issue with MakeMyPopup is that it does absolutely nothing; it has no usable function outside of the fact that it fakes your own customizable pop up.
* The question stands to be asked: Just who would use this? Would you?
* Matter of fact, the person who comes up with the best use for MakeMyPopup in the comments below will get a special shout out in one of our upcoming videos.
* You can download MakeMyPopUp for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Share your thoughts and concerns below.
