* With the recent release of the Auxo-inspired jailbreak tweak, Stratos, perhaps we can chalk this one up to impeccable timing? Indeed, Auxo Legacy Edition, a much anticipated revival of the original Auxo for modern firmware and devices, was teased by the official A3tweaks account this morning, and it looks good.
* Remember, it was almost a year ago when Auxo Legacy was initially teased, so it’s been a long time in the making. But this latest teaser tweet should make your feel confident that it’s almost here.

* The teaser tweet comes with a video preview of Auxo Legacy Edition in action. The team at A3tweaks has been hard at work to make the long-anticipated release a reality. In fact, it’s scheduled to release next month, which could technically only be a matter of days considering we’re nearing the end of February.
* Interestingly enough, it appears that famed developer Ryan Petrich is on board for the development side of things. The original version of Auxo was developed wiz-kid Jack Willis.
* What do you think? Are you looking forward to Auxo Legacy Edition, or has Stratos done enough to quell your thirst?
