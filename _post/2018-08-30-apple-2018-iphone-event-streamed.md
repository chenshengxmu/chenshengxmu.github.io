* Apple plans on offering a live stream to next month’s “Gather round” iPhone event. As with past events, the stream will be available across multiple devices and platforms.
* Announced earlier today, Apple’s next big event will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 12 from the Steve Jobs Theater located on the Apple Park Campus in Cupertino, California. You can add the event to your calendar at this link.
* Apple explains:
* This stream is best experienced on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch using Safari on iOS 10 or later; a Mac using Safari on macOS Sierra 10.12 or later; or a PC using Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge. Streaming to Apple TV via AirPlay requires an Apple TV (2nd generation or later) with the latest Apple TV software or tvOS. Other platforms may also be able to access the stream using recent versions of Chrome or Firefox (MSE, H.264, and AAC required).
* Earlier today, BGR said this year’s event would also stream on Twitter for the first time. Apple hasn’t confirmed this rumor.
* The event on Sept. 12 should be packed full of new hardware announcements. The company is expected to launch three new iPhones, a pair of new iPad Pro tablets, and the fourth-generation Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple’s on track to introduce a new MacBook and MacBook Air, a next-generation Mac mini, and perhaps an updated iMac. The long-delayed AirPower wireless charger is also expected to arrive alongside second-generation AirPods.
