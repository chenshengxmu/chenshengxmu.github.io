* After posting a five-minute World Cup commercial – basically an ode to soccer, its headphones and the iPhone 5s – Beats on Monday released a shorter version of the “The Game Before The Game” ad.
* Titled “Jay Z + Beats by Dre Jungle Remix”, it features a remix of “Jungle”, a song born out of the collaboration between Jay Z, X Ambassadaros and Jamie N Commons. Check it out after the break and tell us what you think in the comments…
* The video, which runs one minute and nine seconds long, ran tonight during game five of the NBA finals.
* Here it is.
* Note the Brazilian references such as “City of God” and “Christ the Redeemer”. For those wondering, the X Ambassadors are a Brooklyn-based four-piece and Jamie N Commons is a British blues, rock and folk musician.
* Both are signed to an Interscope subsidiary where Beats co-founder and music mogul Jimmy Iovine used to be a chairman until the $3 billion deal with Apple required him to step down.
* Tim Cook tweeted out the previous, longer version of “The Game Before The Game” so he could promote the shorter version on his Twitter as well.
* According to Billboard, Jay Z’s Remix will be available exclusively to Beats Music subscribers during its first week of release.
* These videos are part of Beats’ ongoing World Cup campaign which has a website of its own, too. Chief marketing officer Omar Johnson characterized the campaign as the brand’s biggest spend.
* They’ll air several short-form versions of the original ad in more than nine countries and in five different languages. Check out the original five-minute film below, directed by Nabil Elderkin and featuring the original version of Jay Z’s “Jungle”.
* It’s been viewed ten million times in the 11 days since its upload to YouTube.
* Beats is increasingly promoting itself as a brand popular with celebs and pro athletes. For example, its tie-in with ESPN’s Sports Center includes the Beats Pill characters as the “official unoffical” voices of pro basketball commentary.
* A spokesperson for Beats has confirmed the firm’s plan to use the Miami Heat sensation and Samsung shill LeBron James in future advertising for the brand.
* Indeed, LeBron can be seen in the original “The Game Before The Game” commercial alongside Brazilian soccer star Neymar Jr. and a host of other athletes.
