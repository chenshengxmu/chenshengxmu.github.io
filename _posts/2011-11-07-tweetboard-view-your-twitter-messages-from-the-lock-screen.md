* In theory, a jailbreak tweak like TweetBoard sounds great. Viewing all of your Twitter information from the comforts of your Lock screen is one of the reasons that IntelliScreen X is so highly anticipated.
* But the problem with TweetBoard is that it’s half-baked. As it turns out, you can’t actually view your timeline from your Lock screen at all, only your particular tweets.
* Inside we take a look at this promising, but ultimately disappointing jailbreak tweak for iOS 5…
* Not only is there the problem with the inability to view your timeline, but you also can’t reply to tweets, or do much of anything else from TweetBoard.
* To add insult to injury, the tweak is hardcoded to use a double press of the home button to invoke from your Lock screen, eliminating the traditional way of pulling up your App switcher.
* TweetBoard is a tweak that sounds good on paper, but the execution leaves much to be desired. If you’re interested in figuring this out for yourself, you can give it a whirl for $0.99 on Cydia.
* Have you personally tried TweetBoard?
