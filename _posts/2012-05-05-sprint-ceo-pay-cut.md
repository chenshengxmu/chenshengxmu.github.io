* According to both The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse has agreed to a salary reduction that will see his paycheck reduce by a whopping $3.25 million in this year.
* Shareholders weren’t too happy that a formula Sprint uses to calculate its CEO’s compensation fails to take into account high iPhone subsidy.
* Something doesn’t compute here…
* Retures explains:
* Hesse said his 2012 salary would be cut to repay about $346,000 in incentive pay that he has already received and forfeit additional amounts that he was eligible to receive under his 2011 and 2012 incentive plans.
* According to Sprint’s first-quarter earnings, total subsidy costs climbed from $1.1 billion in Q1 2011 to $1.6 billion in Q1 2012. The company attributed the increase to the cost of doing business with Apple, writing in a press release:
* The quarterly year-over-year increase in net subsidy is primarily due to the launch of the iPhone, which on average carries a higher subsidy rate per handset as compared to other handsets.
* Hesse’s reaction to pay cut?
* These voluntary actions regarding my personal compensation, which total $3,250,830, will eliminate any benefit for me to the discretionary adjustment the compensation committee made earlier this year.
* I love it how he’s trying to spin this as a ‘voluntary’ action which has only come as a result of shareholders crying foul.
* Sprint was very well-aware that iPhone carries some of the heftiest subsidies in the industry said to be about $200 higher than other manufacturers. That said, Sprint knew perfectly well they would be betting the farm by coughing up an astounding $15.5 billion to get the iPhone.
* And who could blame them?
* Many carriers agree to Apple’s way of doing business because the iPhone is such an iconic device that attracts new customers and keeps subscriber churn low.
* It’s a win-win for everyone involved.
* Just during Q1 2012, Sprint activated 1.5 million iPhones, 44 percent of which were new customers. In fact, if it weren’t for  the iPhone, the nation’s third-largest carrier would have lost 400,000 customers in the quarter.
* But don’t lose any sleep over Sprint CEO’s salary reduction.
* Last year, Sprint upped Hesse’s pay by 31 percent to $11.9 million using the ‘flawed’ formula. With this $3.25 million hit, the CEO’s pay in 2012 drops to $8.65 million, which is about approximately half a million dollar less compared to where it stood at last year and back to 2010 levels.
* I wouldn’t mind a pay cut if my salary was in the range of millions.
* Did Hesse do the right thing or is this another case of too little, too late?
