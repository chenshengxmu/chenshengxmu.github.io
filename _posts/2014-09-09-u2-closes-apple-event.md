* As rumored, Apple brought up U2 on stage to perform at the close of today’s event. Bono and the band played a single off of their new record “Songs of Innocence,” and following the set, Tim Cook announced that Apple will be giving a free copy of the album away to iTunes users over the next month.
* This may not seem like a big deal at first, but think about it: this album will be free for every iTunes Store customer. That’s over half a billion users, in some 120 countries, that will be able to access the free download today. Cook says this will make Songs of Innocence the “largest album release in history.”
* Apple says the album is available “right now,” but we’re not seeing it yet. We imagine it will take a while for it to roll out to all regions.
