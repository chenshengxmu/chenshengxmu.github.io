title: Australian Court Extends Galaxy Tablet Ban One Week
---
* A week after overturning a Samsung tablet ban ruling in Australia, a judge has now extended the ban for one more week, as reported by Bloomberg:
* Apple Inc. (AAPL) won a one-week extension of a ban on Samsung Electronics Co.’s sales of its latest tablet computer in Australia, delaying pre-Christmas sales, in a battle that began in April in the U.S. and spread to four continents.
* High Court Justice John Dyson Heydon today extended the ban on the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 to Dec. 9. On that day, the country’s top court will consider Apple’s request for permission to appeal a lower court’s order issued earlier this week, which lifted a ban on the product that has been in place since mid-October.
* Drama down under!
