* Apple is going to release earnings for its third fiscal 2015 quarter on Tuesday, July 21, according to an update published last evening on the company’s Investor Relations webpage. A conference call to discuss third fiscal quarter earnings with Wall Street investors will be taking place on Tuesday, July 21, 2015 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern Time.
* Three months ago, Apple provided revenue guidance for this quarter between $46 billion and $48 billion, with gross margin set between 38.5 and 39.5 percent.
* During the previous financial quarter, Apple reported $13.6 billion in profit on revenues of $58 billion fueled by sales of 61.17 million iPhones, 4.56 million Macs, a ten percent increase, and 12.6 million iPads, a 23 percent year-over-year unit drop.
* A live audio stream of the call requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 4.2 or above, a Mac running OS X 10.6.8 or above or a PC running QuickTime 7 or later.
* Safari or Internet Explorer is also required.
* Just don’t expect Apple Watch numbers as Apple has made it clear it won’t be divulging sales of the wrist-worn device for competitive reasons. Instead, Apple Watch sales are lumped together with iPods, Apple TVs, Beats Electronics hardware and Apple-branded and third-party accessories in the Other Products category.
* Revenue from the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, iBooks Store, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services is collectively reported in the Services section of Apple’s earnings reports.
* iDownloadBlog will provide live coverage of Apple’s July 21 earnings report.
