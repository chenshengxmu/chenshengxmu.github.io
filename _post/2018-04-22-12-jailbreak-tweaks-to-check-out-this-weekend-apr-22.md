* Colorify is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you set up custom color configurations in the official Spotify Music app for iOS.
* After you install it, you can visit the Settings app and begin colorizing each element of the app individually; this means you can achieve virtually any custom look you want.
* You can learn more about Colorify and how it works in our full review.

* Everyone wants to have faster access to their favorite features on their iPhone, but Apple isn’t particularly accomodating in this respect. Jumper is a new free jailbreak tweak that can change that.
* With Jumper, you can customize the stock Camera and Flashlight Lock screen shortcuts in iOS 11 to redirect you to any two installed apps of your choice. The tweak even themes the shortcuts to match the respective app icon, so it makes them distinguishable.
* Jumper is a great way to get to your favorite apps more quickly, and you can learn more about how it works in our full review.
