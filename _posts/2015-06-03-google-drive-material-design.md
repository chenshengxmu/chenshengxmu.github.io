* Google on Wednesday issued a version 4.0 update to its free of charge Google Drive for iOS application in the App Store. The first thing you’ll notice is a brand new design which follows Material Design guidelines set forth by Google itself.
* In addition to a cleaned-up interface, other changes in Google Drive 4.0 for iPhone and iPad include much faster syncing of your files, as well as image viewing.
* Scrolling performance has been improved, too, and they’ve finally implemented iOS’s standard swipe gesture to go back.
* Material Design is Google’s design language for software development across desktop, mobile and the web. With the new Google Drive app featuring Material Design aesthetics, Google has taken another step toward achieving consistency across devices and platforms.
