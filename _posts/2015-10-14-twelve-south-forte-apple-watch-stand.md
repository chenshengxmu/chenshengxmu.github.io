* Apple-exclusive accessory maker Twelve South released its HiRise charging stand for the Apple Watch back in the summer.
* As I noted in my review, the only thing holding it and other Apple Watch stands back is a somewhat complicated setup requiring you to assemble the pieces yourself, including using the inductive charging disc that came with your watch.
* Now Twelve South has created the Forté as a brand new Apple Watch stand that supports both portrait and Nightstand modes while allowing you to simultaneously rest your iPhone on the base of the accessory.
* Described as “the first full-featured stand that you can find in Apple Store,” the Forté is being marketed as a luxury stand and charging dock crafted to “match the timeless beauty of Apple Watch, from shape and standards, to fit and finish.”
* The Forté displays your Apple Watch atop the brilliant chrome stand at a 40-degree angle for easy bedside access. It protects your Apple Watch and band from scratching with a soft, top grain leather wrapped base.
* The Forté’s arm allows for easy bedside viewing in either portrait or Nightstand mode. The accessory is compatible with all Apple Watch bands, from closed-loop Link Bracelets to two-piece styles and Sport models.

* For those wondering, the requirement to use your own MagSafe charging disc of Apple Watch charging stands will go away soon as Apple has promised to allow third-party vendors to design accessories with integrated charging pads.

* The Forté is available in Apple Stores in the United States and Canada starting today, and from the Twelve South webstore for $59.99. The company will be rolling out the accessory to Apple Stores in other regions “in the coming weeks.”
