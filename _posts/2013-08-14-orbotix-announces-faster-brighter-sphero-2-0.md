* The Sphero ball was one of the first iPhone-controlled accessories to hit the market back in 2010, and it has long been a favorite of enthusiasts. The baseball-sized rolling ball can be remotely controlled via an iOS or Android app.
* Today, Orbotix announced the successor to the Sphero ball: Sphero 2.0. The upgraded accessory is more than twice as fast as its predecessor—capable of rolling at 7 FPS—and three times as bright, with more LEDs and colors…
* On the outside, the ball looks the same as version 1, save for a new removable, bumpy, rubber shell that allows the already waterproof Sphero to handle new terrain like mud and ice. And of course the shells come in various colors.
* On the inside, things are a little bit different. Sphero 2.0 features more and brighter LED lights, as well as a custom Bluetooth chip that the company says will speed up communication between the ball and the device controlling it.
* If you’re interested, Sphero 2 pre-orders begin today for $130, but they’ll eventually be sold at Apple Stores. The device comes with two ramps, optional ‘Nubby’ covers ($15), and there are 25+ apps available that interact with the ball.
