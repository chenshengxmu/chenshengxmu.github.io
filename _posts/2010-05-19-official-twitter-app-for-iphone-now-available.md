* RIP Tweetie, hello Twitter!

* For those of you who don’t know, my favorite Twitter app for iPhone, Tweetie, was acquired by Twitter a few weeks ago. Twitter then rebranded the app to call it “Twitter”.
* If like me you’re a pretty heavy Twitter user, you might be worried that Twitter will kill the “quote” feature to make it like their own native retweet feature.
* Before being bought out by Twitter, the app was available for $2.99, but it is now free. You can download it directly from this link.
* Note that it is not available everywhere yet. Although the link works, I haven’t been able to download it. I guess it needs to propagate through all the servers of the App Store.
