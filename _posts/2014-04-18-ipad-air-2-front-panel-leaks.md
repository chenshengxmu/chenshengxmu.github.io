* Like everyone and their brother, KGI Securities analysts Ming-Chi Kuo is counting on the release of a second-generation iPad Air by October. The device should be refreshed with Apple’s upcoming in-house designed A8 processor, the Touch ID sensor, an improved back-facing iSight camera with a new eight-megapixel sensor, the analyst reckoned in a recent note to clients.
* That said, we haven’t seen much in the way of leaks concerning the iPad Air 2 – that is, until today. An image posted this morning by Dutch blog One More Thing claims to represent a front panel said to belong to the forthcoming device, revealing what appears to be an integrated display technology that should results in a thinner and lighter display assembly…
* According to One More Thing [Google translation, via MacRumors], the purported front panel part (pictured top of post and below) has the Home button hole at the bottom and another one at the top for a front-facing FaceTime camera.
* The biggest takeaway is a possibly integrated display technology. As you know, the iPad Air was criticized for not integrating the separate front panel and display modules into one part.
* Not only would have that allowed for a thinner device, but the integrated display assembly would have enabled improved picture quality by removing a layer between the two parts to make the image appear as if painted directly on the glass.

* MacRumors spoke to iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens about the leaked component, who suggested that Apple could be using a manufacturing process similar to that seen on the Retina MacBook Pro.
* “The move to an integrated panel/display would increase repair costs, but ease of repair has not been a particularly major focus for Apple and the company already uses an integrated display on the iPhone,” he explained.
* As things stand right now, it appears that the second-generation iPad Air is going to be a specs upgrade with a speedier processor, an improved camera, an up-to-date display technology and possibly a bit slimmer appearance.
* The headline hardware addition should be Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Apple could also bond a thin layer of sapphire sheet to the cover glass to make the screen stronger and prone to scratches.
* Would you consider ditching your iPad Air for a second-generation model?
