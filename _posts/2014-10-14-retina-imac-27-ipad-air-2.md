* Apple plans to unveil a new 27-inch iMac with Retina display at its event tomorrow, reports Ming-Chi Kuo. In a note to investors, the highly regarded analyst offers up last minute predictions of what Mac and iOS products we can expect to see announced during the keynote.
* Kuo says that a 27-inch Retina iMac is on the docket, and should be available before the end of the year. Due to the difficulties involved in developing and mass producing different hi-res panels, however, he doesn’t see a 21-inch version arriving before the second half of 2015.
* Rounding out his forecast for new Mac products, Kuo reiterates recent reports that new MacBook models will not make an appearance at the event, as Apple awaits Intel’s Broadwell chips. He doesn’t mention anything about the mini, though, which is long overdue for an update.
* As for iOS devices, the KGI Securities analyst believes the iPad Air 2 will headline the keynote, with the iPad mini receiving minimal attention. However, due to poor yield rates of the anti-reflective coating used on its displays, he expects initial iPad Air 2 supplies to be very limited.
* Apple last week invited members of the press to a low-key event at its Town Hall auditorium on October 16. We’re expecting to see new iPads, new Macs and more details regarding OS X Yosemite and Apple Pay. The event starts at 10am PST, and iDB will be providing live coverage.
