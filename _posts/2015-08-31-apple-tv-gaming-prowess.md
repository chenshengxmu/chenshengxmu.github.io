* Just as the iPhone and iPad have been chipping away mercilessly at Nintendo’s dominance in the handheld gaming market, Apple’s next-generation set-top box should give dedicated game consoles a good run for their money.
* A report by 9to5Mac’s well-informed writer Mark Gurman lays out a few upcoming features for a rumored fourth-generation Apple TV that are bound to prompt gamers, casual and hardcore alike, to jump with joy.
* The next Apple TV is widely expected to include long-awaited voice control via Siri. Indeed, a revamped remote for the device, described by 9to5Mac’s source as being “near-universal,”will reportedly feature a built-in microphone and a dedicated Siri button.

* “A source who has used the product says that ‘you can navigate [mostly everything] on the new Apple TV [solely] using the new Siri button’,” writes Gurman.
* “The source also called the deep integration of Siri a ‘main focus’ for the new box, as its convenience will appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike,” the article reads.
* The article stops short of saying whether or not Apple will open up Siri to third-party developers anytime soon, a long-expected move that might opening door to Siri-base casual gaming with voice control.
* The next Apple TV’s sensor-laden remote with Nintendo Wii-like motion sensing is just a tip of the iceberg. The redesigned accessory is said to be thicker than the current aluminum remote for the Apple TV and include a touchpad that could even make existing iPhone and iPad games playable with ease on a big screen TV.

* In addition to the Siri button, the revamped remote apparently includes a dedicated Home button which takes you straight back to the Home screen and utilizes a standard replaceable battery. It will connect to the Apple TV over Bluetooth, as opposed to the inferior infrared connectivity on the current remote.
* “As a result, the Apple TV’s support for motion controls is unlikely to include a system navigation and pointing interface akin to Nintendo’s Wii,” Gurman writes. Gamers will even be permitted to connect multiple Bluetooth gaming controllers to their Apple TV and choose between them.
* The next Apple TV is widely expected to use the iPhone 6’s dual-core A8 processor with increased performance owing to the fact that the set-top box will be connected to a power outlet. Because energy consumption is not a major concern, Apple can conformably raise A8’s clock frequency to make it run faster.
* The device will run an unreleased version of iOS 9 operating system and include a dedicated App Store with third-party game and app downloads.
* According to Gurman’s sources, the new Apple TV will be indeed formally unveiled at Apple’s iPhone 6s media event on Wednesday, September 9. The set-top box device will reportedly ship in October for between $149 and $199.

* By the way, Apple’s invite graphics could hint at “near-universal Siri control.”
* As a huge sucker for high-quality games on iPhones and iPads, I can’t tell how many times I wished that the Apple TV had downloadable games.
* Squinting at tiny mobile screens isn’t exactly my idea of prolonged gaming so I’ll be making sure to purchase the new Apple TV the day it lands on store shelves.
* And what are you most excited about for Apple’s September 9 event?
