* Where do I start? That’s the first thing that you’ll probably think to yourself after installing Canopy for iOS 7. The original Canopy succeeded in supercharging Safari, filling it with tons of practical new features, and this new version of Canopy for iOS 7 does likewise.
* How does adding open in Chrome support sound? Or what about a quick paste and go option like Chrome for the desktop? How about adding quick translation features or accessing recently closed pages? You can do all of that with Canopy for iOS 7 and more.
* Most of Canopy’s features are enabled and ready to go right out of the box, but there is a preference panel that contains some of the settings and additional pieces of information. Canopy is so feature rich that its preferences contain a list of the things you can do with the tweak. Here are some of the settings that you will find:
* Needless to say, that’s a ton of new settings, and you probably won’t use all of them. But, if you’re like me, you’ll surely find a couple of favorite features from this massive list.
* My favorite features are the inline paste and go for the address bar, and the address bar search suggestion inserts without submitting. I also like the ability to translate pages, which is useful for viewing Apple blogs from other countries.
* So even if you only use a few features, Canopy makes good on its value at only $1.99 on the BigBoss repo. If you’re a big Safari proponent and you’re jailbroken, then you should definitely take this tweak for a spin. What do you think?
