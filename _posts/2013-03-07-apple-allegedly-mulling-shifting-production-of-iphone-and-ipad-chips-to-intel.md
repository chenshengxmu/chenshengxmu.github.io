title: Apple (again) mulling shifting production of iPhone and iPad chips to Intel

* A report Wednesday revives the old rumor that the world’s leading chip maker, Intel, is working on a strategic deal to manufacture processors that power Apple’s iPhones, iPads and iPods.
* What’s different this time around, though, is the timing: Intel’s CEO Paul Otellini is on his way out and with CEO search still underway, the semiconductor giant could be poised to take its relationship with Apple to the next level.
* The gist of the report is that Apple could contract Intel as a foundry, meaning the chip giant would tap its world-class manufacturing expertise to produce iPhone and iPad processors, as designed in-house by Apple, rather than persuade Tim Cook & Co. into adopting Intel’s own mobile Atom x86 chip architecture, which hasn’t made much inroads yet…
* Reuters has the scoop:
* Intel said last week it will open up its prized manufacturing technology to make chips designed by fellow chipmaker Altera – snagging its first sizeable customer in a contract manufacturing, or “foundry”, business expected to grow.
* That has spurred talk of an Apple deal. A source close to one of the companies says Intel and Apple executives have discussed the issue in the past year but no agreement has been reached.
* Intel, of course, has been a major supplier of processors for Mac notebooks and desktops since 2005.
* Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy told the news gathering organization the company is “in constant discussions with Apple,” though he wouldn’t comment on negotiations about a potential foundry relationship. With persisting rumors of Apple looking to distance itself from Samsung due to ongoing litigation, anything is possible.
* If Apple is to take its lucrative chip making contract elsewhere, the company doesn’t really have much choice. There are only a few semiconductor makers that can meet Apple’s exacting standards in terms of volume, yields and advanced process technologies used to fab power-savvy mobile chips.

* Samsung, which currently builds Apple’s in-house designed processors for iDevices at its sophisticated Austin, Texas plant, is one of them. The other oft-rumored potential partner is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).
* Reuters notes that Intel’s chip-manufacturing technology “is at least two years ahead” of TSMC’s or Samsung’s foundry, making talk of Intel-fabbed device silicon highly probable.
* After Intel upped its capital spending budget by $2 billion to $13 billion this year, speculation grew that Apple could ink a deal to use Intel’s leading process technology to make better chips for its iPad and iPhone.
* Doing so could help Apple end its foundry relationship with Samsung, which has become a fierce competitor with its own smartphones and tablets.
* Shifting production of iPhone and iPad chips to Intel could be an additional $4.2 billion revenue opportunity for Intel in 2015, with a gross margin of around 50 percent, according to Macquarie analyst Shawn Webster.

* Interestingly enough, TSMC Chairman and CEO Morris Chang recently said his company has received a “very large volume” order from an unspecified customer, prompting watchers to speculate that the mysterious buyer could be Apple.
* It has also been reported that the Taiwanese foundry is looking to fab a next-gen processor for a “breakthrough” Apple device on its upcoming cutting-edge 16nm FinFET process. At any rate, looks like Samsung will be the big loser, even if Apple is only looking to diversify its chip suppliers.
