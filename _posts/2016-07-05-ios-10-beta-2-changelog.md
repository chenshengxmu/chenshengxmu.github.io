* Apple today seeded a second beta of iOS 10 to its registered developers and this time around, release notes are pretty packed to reflect that the company has squashed many bugs in iOS 10 beta 2 while also bringing out a bunch of notable changes, refinements and new features. Here’s our running list of everything that has been changed or tweaked in iOS 10 beta 2.
* My colleague Andrew has put together a video to show you guys 34 new features, improvements and tweaks in beta 2 that have impressed him enough. Because iOS 10 is currently in beta, Apple cautions that “some devices may experience performance issues, such as hangs and frame drops” so there’s that.
* For a more detailed overview of all the new stuff in iOS 10 beta 2, see further below.
* We’ll be updating this running list with more new features in iOS 10 beta 2 as we encounter them. In the meantime, feel free to contribute by telling us about your own findings in iOS 10 beta 2 down in the comments.
* You can now access widgets while using the Notification Center on any Home screen.
* In beta 1, accessing the Notification Center from a Home screen only showed notifications, not the widgets. It’s a small but important improvement, more so given that the first beta limited accessing the widgets from your Lock screen, Home screen zero and inside the Notification Center, but only if called while using an app.

* In short, widgets are now available in the Notification Center without exceptions.
* As you can see for yourself, “Missed” inside iOS 10 beta 2′ Notification Center is now labeled “Recent” and The Weather Channel gets a much-deserved credit. On devices without 3D Touch, iOS 10’s rich notifications can now be interacted with by way of swiping down on them.
* In iOS 10 beta 1, you had to slide over a notification banner to access its options.
* You can once again shuffle all music by one artist in the Music app.
* Plus, there’s now a Shuffle button within the Songs section so that you can enter shuffle mode without needing to play a song first. Connect tab no longer disappears from the Music app when you disable Apple Music and posts from artists you follow now appear underneath a new Connect Posts heading within the Music app’s For You section.
* In iOS 10 beta 2, users can now sign in to Apple Music on Sonos, music videos can be played fullscreen and related music suggestions now appear in album pages. AirPlay devices and Bluetooth speakers and headphones show up on the Now Playing screen as well, you can now tap an artist’s name to reveal its full catalog and playlists now show in search results.

* In Library, you can now view and manage a list of all active downloads.
* There’s a new Downloaded icon for playlists that have been downloaded to the Music app. Speaking of downloads, the Downloaded Music section has been renamed as Downloads and can no longer be removed. And lastly, the Music app now uses a smaller font and lets you adjust text size via the global Dynamic Text option in Settings.
* According to Apple, certain Apple Music features will become available in a future iOS 10 beta, including the following items:
* Three days ago, Apple launched downloadable sticker packs for iOS 10’s much-improved Messages app. In iOS 10 beta 2, a dedicated iMessage Apps section has gone live within the App Store. The App Store tab inside Messages now shows a splash screen and lets you browse and download Featured content.
* You’ll also notice a new Manage section within the App Store for Messages and a switch labeled Automatically Add Apps inside of it. Toggling it to the ON prompts iOS to automatically put any apps on your device that include an iMessage extension in your app drawer in Messages. In iOS 10 beta 2, you can also delete installed iMessage apps.

* iOS 10 beta 2 also adds a new Low Quality Image Mode option in Settings → Messages. If enabled, all images will be sent in lower quality to help save cellular data.
* Quick Reply for Messages notifications on non-3D Touch devices now presents you with the same embedded conversation view like on the iPhone 6s. And finally, your Digital Touch messages will now send to non-iOS 10 users in beta 2, but they won’t animate.

* The layout of the Digital Touch interface within Messages has been cleaned up a bit and iPad users will appreciate a brand new handwriting keyboard button in Messages.
* A single organ donor can save as many as eight lives so Apple has built a new option into the Health application on iOS 10 beta 2 which permits U.S.-based customers to register themselves as an organ, eye and tissue donor with Donate Life America’s national organ donation registry.

* iOS 10 beta 1 has dropped the familiar slide-to-unlock gesture in favor of a new way of unlocking the device that requires you to press the Home button with an enrolled finger to get to the Home screen, or rest the finger on the Home button to unlock the device without launching the Home screen.

* In iOS 10 beta 2, there’s a new Rest Finger to Unlock option in Settings → General → Accessibility → Home Button which allows you to switch back to the old way of unlocking that didn’t require a press of the Home button.
* And lastly, a padlock icon in the iOS status bar now animates with an “Unlocked” message when you unlock the device. Previously, the padlock icon simply disappeared.

* In addition to the aforementioned refinements, iOS 10 beta 2 includes the following tweaks, design changes and other improvements:
* Some features do not work as expected yet because iOS 10 is currently in beta. For example, Faces in the Photos app do not sync across your devices

* More importantly, functionality which requires adoption from the App Store apps, such as iMessage apps, SiriKit and Maps extensions, will not be available until those apps are able to adopt and submit to the App Store.

* As long as iOS 10 is in beta, expect bugs and various hiccups.
* Apple typically optimizes iOS for speed and low battery consumption after all of the features have been locked, bugs squashed and code thoroughly tested, meaning by the time one of the betas reaches a Golden Master status.
* iOS 10 is available to members of the Apple Developer Program and will launch to public beta testers signed on the Apple Beta Software Program in July ahead of public availability this fall.
* System requirements for iOS 10 are the same as those for its predecessor, but the iPhone 4s, original iPad mini and iPad 2 are no longer supported.
