* Although you never can tell with these sorts of things, it doesn’t look like we’ll be seeing an OS X version of Pangu in the immediate future. Although I’m sure that the Pangu guys are working feverishly on an OS X version of the jailbreak tool for iOS 8.x, it likely lags behind other priorities, such as translation, embedding Cydia, etc.
* With that in mind, what options exist for those of us in Mac-only households? You could, of course, visit a friend who owns a Windows machine. Or, you can do what I always do, and install Pangu and jailbreak using a Windows virtual machine on OS X. In fact, you may be surprised (or not), but I don’t own a Windows machine, and haven’t in years. But I’m always able to jailbreak on day one due to my Windows virtual machines.
* In this tutorial, I’ll tell you how to set up and install a virtual machine for free in order to jailbreak iOS 8.1 with Pangu on your Mac.
* Step 1: Download and install Parallels Desktop 10. Parallels offers a free 14-day trial, which is more than enough time to jailbreak your iOS 8.x device using Pangu. It should at least hold you over until the OS X version of Pangu.
* Step 2: Download the Windows 8.1 Enterprise evaluation. Microsoft offers a free 90-day trial for Windows 8.1, which is again, plenty of time to hold you over.
* Step 3: Install Windows 8.1 using Parallels Desktop 10. The install process is simple. After you download Windows 8.1, launch Parallels, go to File → New, and click Install Windows from DVD or Image File. Point to the Windows .ISO file you downloaded in step 2, and the install process should begin.
* Step 4: After you’re up and running with your Windows 8.1 virtual machine, install Parallels Tools by going to Action → Install Parallels Tools.
* Step 5: Then it’s simply a matter of following our iOS 8.x jailbreak tutorial to jailbreak your iDevice running iOS 8.x. After that, you can use our other tutorial to install Cydia.
* That’s pretty much it. You can easily jailbreak right now on OS X using this method. It’s what I do. It’s what I’ve always done. And it works every time. If you’re desperate for a jailbreak now, then use this method, it only take a few minutes once you’ve downloaded Windows.
* What do you think? Will you try it?
