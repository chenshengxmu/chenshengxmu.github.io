* Apple seeded the 2nd beta of their iOS 5 software to developers last Friday. As typical of any new iOS firmware release, we have been asked if the new update can be jailbroken and unlocked.
* Though we’ve heard the disappointing news that the new firmware has patched the Gevey SIM unlock, the software is certainly still jailbreakable. RedSn0w was the first to announce compatibility with the new beta, but Sn0wBreeze wasn’t far behind…
* iDevice hacker ih8sn0w announced to the Twitter world yesterday that he has updated Sn0wbreeze to work with Apple’s latest iOS 5 beta software. Along with the tweet, he included some notes regarding the jailbreak.
* Sn0wbreeze works with the iPhone 3GS and both GSM and CDMA versions of the iPhone 4. It also works with the iPad and the 2 latest models of the iPod touch.
* If you happen to have an iPhone 3GS with the old bootrom, the Sn0wbreeze jailbreak is untethered. For all other devices, you’ll be plugging into your computer every time you do a restart.
* If you have iOS 5 beta 2 and are looking to jailbreak it, you can head on over to our downloads page and grab the software. If you need a quick refresh on how to use Sn0wbreeze, feel free to check out our tutorial.
* Any questions?
