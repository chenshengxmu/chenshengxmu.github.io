* On Monday, Apple pushed out a new HomePod software update. It arrives within the iOS 12 release for iPhone and iPad. 
* The HomePod update includes all of the new features Apple announced at last week’s “Gather round” event. These include:
* To update your HomePod once you have iOS installed:
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 2) Tap the arrow icon in the upper-left corner.
* 3) Choose the Software Update option.
* 4) If there’s a new software update available for your HomePod, tap Install and follow onscreen instructions to apply the new firmware to your Siri-driven speaker.
* The HomePod update arrives on the same day as the public launch of iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5.
