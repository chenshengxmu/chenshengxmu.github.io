* Following up releases from both the Dev Team and Chronic Dev Team, iH8sn0w has seeded a new version of his popular jailbreak tool, Sn0wBreeze, to include pod2g’s iOS 5.0.1 untether. But he didn’t stop there.
* In light of Sn0wBreeze’s two-year anniversary, iH8sn0w has incorporated a number of new features into the utility. Among those is support for older firmware (all the way back to iOS 3.1.3) and an IPSW downloader…
* Here’s a full list of the changes in Sn0wBreeze v2.9, as noted on iH8sn0w’s blog:
* Sn0wBreeze 2.9 supports every firmware from iOS 3.1.3 to 5.0.1, except for iOS 4.3.4, 4.3.5 and iOS 5 (which iH8sn0w says are coming soon). It will not work with A5 devices like the iPad 2 or iPhone 4S, as there’s not currently an available iBoot exploit.
* If you want to check Sn0wBreeze 2.9 out for yourself, you can grab it from our Downloads page. If you are looking for some help on using Sn0wBreeze to jailbreak your device, you can find that here.
* Have you tried the update yet? What do you think?
