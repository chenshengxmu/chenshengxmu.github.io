* Last month, Apple expanded its in-store trade-in program to include iPads. Under its Reuse and Recycling initiative, the program allows users to bring in their old iPads and trade them in for store credit, based on model, condition and other factors.
* Initially, the option was only available at Apple stores in the US and Canada, but the company has expanded it overseas this week. Reports are coming in this morning that the iPad trade-in program is now available in France, Spain and Germany…
* As noted by 9to5Mac, reports from iPhoneaddict.fr, Macerkopf.de, and Applesfera all confirm that Apple’s new iPad trade-program has launched at retail stores in the aforementioned countries. And it’s likely that other countries will soon be added.

* Like in the US and Canada, the stores are accepting iPads 2, 3 and 4, and original iPad minis (no Airs or Retina minis), with their value determined by several factors. iPads that won’t turn on, have cracked screens or are jailbroken won’t be considered.
* Apple first launched its iOS device trade-in program in August of last year, and is currently running a promotion that offers extra store credit for those trading in older model iPhones towards the purchase of a new iPhone 5s or 5c (with contract).
