* Google continues rolling out support for the native iPhone X display resolution in its popular apps for iPhone and iPad, with the company’s Zagat and Google Trips apps the latest to receive official support for Apple’s OLED smartphone.
* Now both apps take full advantage of every single pixel offered by the 5.8-inch OLED panel on Apple’s latest flagship smartphone without being limited by the black bars at the top and bottom which iOS uses if an app hasn’t been optimized with iPhone X in mind.
