* Prolific 3D artist Martin Hajek has taken it upon himself to envision what an iPhone 7 model with a rumored dark blue colorway might look like. The resulting renderings will make you a believer, if for nothing else than the fact that those antenna seams could be far less visible on the dark blue background.

* And here are the mockups.
