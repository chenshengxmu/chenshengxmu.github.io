* One of my long-time favorite jailbreak tweaks for organizing my incoming notifications is Priority Hub, but the tweak was never updated to support iOS 10. If you’re in the same boat and miss this classic tweak, then you might want to try a new release called Atmos by iOS developer Antique.
* After you install Atmos, your notifications are grouped by app both on the Lock screen and in Notification Center. With this sort of organization, you can focus on what’s important rather than looking at a chaotic menagerie of mixed notifications.
* Above, you can see what things look like on the Lock screen, and below, you can see the tweak in action in Notification Center:

* Atmos is nearly identical in both interfaces, so there’s not much to say there.
* You can quickly filter notifications by the app they came from by just tapping on the app icon. For example, if I don’t want to deal with my Messages notifications right now, I can tap on my Twitter app icon to see what missed notifications I have for Twitter, or vice-versa.
* Atmos adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure options for both the Lock screen and Notification Center interfaces:

* We’ll split things up for you below, although most of the options for each interface are identical:
* Lock screen
* Notification Center
* That just about wraps things up for configuring Atmos. The developer keeps things simplistic, as these are all the options you could ever really need for a tweak like this.
* From our testing, we found that Atmos is an excellent recreation of the Priority Hub experience, but while the original tweak was a free download from Cydia, Atmos is not. For some, this will be an immediate deterrent, but if you liked the functionality enough, then the purchase is a no-brainer.
* You can download Atmos for $1.50 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository, and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Are you a fan of the way Atmos organizes your Lock screen and Notification Center notifications? Share in the comments section below.
