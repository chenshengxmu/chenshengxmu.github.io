* It’s an eery feeling when you write an article and on the same day the company you wrote about changes or modifies a policy related to the content of your story. It makes you feel like they’re watching you.
* We posted a story about the SDK for iOS and how the cloudy restrictive nature of the acceptance process might be hurting the creative flow of the App Store. Less than 2 hours later 9 to 5 Mac posted a statement by Apple regarding the App Store review guidelines…
* Here is the meat and bones of the press release:
* We (Apple)  are relaxing all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps do not download any code. This should give developers the flexibility they want, while preserving the security we need.
* Where did that come from? Perhaps Apple is feeling some heat behind the scenes from the feds little investigation regarding their review process. It seems like the only reasonable explanation for the change of heart that seems to allow developers to include Flash in their applications.
* As we last reported the European Commissions office had joined the possible probe regarding Apple’s behavior against Adobe. While Adobe recently shrugged it off it seems a little odd that Cupertino would change their policy just for the heck of it.
* What do you think? What would this mean for the App Store? Anyone else think Apple had the authorities breathing down their neck? Give us your opinion in the comment box below.
