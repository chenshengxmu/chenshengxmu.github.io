* With all of the talk of Apple losing its dominance, and its stock price taking a $200 bath towards the end of last year, the Cupertino company needed a big holiday quarter to quiet its critics. Outside figures look good, but we won’t know for sure until Apple says something.
* Fortunately, we won’t have to wait much longer for it to break the silence. The iPad-maker has updated its Investor Relations page this afternoon to note that it will announce its earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 (4th calendar of 2012) on Wednesday, January 23…
* Between its aggressive international rollout of the iPhone 5 — 100+ countries in 3 months — and the release of the new iPad mini and 4th gen iPad, Apple is expected to have broken several of its own records during the quarter, including ones for both iPhone and iPad sales.
* The conference call is slated to begin at 2:00 PM PT on the 23rd, and as usual, Apple will be providing an audio webcast for those who want to listen in. Otherwise, you can tune into iDB that afternoon, as we will be covering the call and passing along all noteworthy announcements.
