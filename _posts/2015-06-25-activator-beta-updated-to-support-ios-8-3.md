* Activator, an absolute staple tweak for jailbreakers, has been updated for iOS 8.3. The Ryan Petrich developed jailbreak tweak is not only great on its own, but it’s the backbone to a lot of the existing jailbreak tweaks, and opens up the floodgates to the rest of the vast Cydia library.
* To install Activator 1.9.3 beta 5, you’ll need to add Ryan’s beta repo to your list of Cydia sources. Check inside for all of the details.
* Add the following source to Cydia to enable Ryan’s beta repo:
* http://rpetri.ch/repo
* Once you do, simply search for Activator, and install the beta. Once the beta is installed, you can use it by itself, or take advantage of any number of the many jailbreak tweaks that use Activator.
