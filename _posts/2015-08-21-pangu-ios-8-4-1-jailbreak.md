* I have to be honest, I didn’t think we’d see a jailbreak for a long time after Apple fixed what seemed like a gazillion different security holes in iOS 8.4.1, but here we are. Just over a week after iOS 8.4.1 was released, the Pangu team showcased an iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak on an iPhone 6 at Friday’s HackPwn2015 security conference.

* Details about the jailbreak were posted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo, so English accounts are scarce. What is obvious, though, is that an iPhone 6 jailbreak for iOS 8.4.1 was apparently demonstrated.
* It also seems as if this was just a demonstration to show that it was possible, and that Pangu has no intentions of releasing this jailbreak publicly. That’s probably a wise decision seeing as we’re less than a month away from iOS 9. No need to burn exploits on a software version that will be all but a distant memory in just a few weeks.
* What do you think? Are you surprised that, despite all of the fixed exploits in iOS 8.4.1, the Pangu team was still able to jailbreak in such a short period of time? That makes me think that they are pretty confident about iOS 9.
* What say you?
