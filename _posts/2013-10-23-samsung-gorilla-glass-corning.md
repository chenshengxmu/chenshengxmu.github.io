* Gorilla Glass maker Corning has a new partner: Samsung. The South Korean firm is taking ownership in the company which produces tough glass displays for the iPhone and just about everyone else. At the same time, the $2 billion agreement gives Samsung a 10-year a supply contract while Corning gets the cash to explore future technology.
* Along with making highly-resistant glass for smartphones, Corning could also be tapped to produce flexible material aimed at the growing number of wearable devices, such as Samsung’s Galaxy Gear and Apple’s long-rumored iWatch…
* Corning confirmed in media release Wednesday that it has entered into a series of strategic and financial agreements with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. The partnership is intended to strengthen product and technology collaborations between the two companies.
* The transactions should close in the first quarter of 2014.
* With this move, Samsung’s combined investment in Corning would result in approximately 7.4 percent ownership stake. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the deal puts Samsung in a ratger comfortable position where it’s able to gain access to Corning’s new technologies ahead of others.

* This especially includes Apple which has relied on Corning’s protective cover glass technology for iPhones since 2007. Earlier this year, Samsung also purchased OLED maker Novaled for $347 million.
* As part of the deal with Corning, the glass maker gains outright ownership of an LCD plant in Korea previously co-owned with Samsung.
* Along with a new Retina-based iPad and the talked-about iWatch, Apple is also reportedly thinking of producing large-screen televisions. Corning had been mentioned as one of the possible suppliers.
* Ahead of the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s launch, the glass maker reportedly was developing Lotus XT Glass for the new generation of Apple handsets.
