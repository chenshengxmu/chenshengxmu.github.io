* Earlier today, Apple’s new Retina display-equipped iPad went on sale around the world. Perhaps even more exciting was the fact that the Dev Team was able to jailbreak the new tablet within a matter of hours.
* Now it looks like there has been another development. Well-known iDevice hacker i0n1c has just announced that he has jailbroken his third-generation iPad. Oh yeah, and it’s untethered…
* I0n1c, known for his work on the iOS 4 untether, has been talking about jailbreaking the new iPad for several days now. And it appears that he has delivered on his promise, and then some.
* It’s worth noting that i0n1c hasn’t participated in jailbreak-creation for quite some time now. And nobody’s really sure whether or not he’s going to share his work on the new tablet with other hackers.
* But the good news is that it’s possible. As always, we’ll let you know the second we find out more details. Stay tuned.
* P.S. Don’t have a new iPad to jailbreak? That’s ok, we just happen to be giving one away for free.
