* A couple days ago, RedSn0w was updated to fix the iBooks DRM issue where some images wouldn’t display properly, or wouldn’t even display at all. At the time, we noted that a Corona update shouldn’t be too far out.
* Saurik just announced on Twitter that Corona has been updated to version 1.0-7 to fix those issues mentioned above…
* Saurik noted that this fix is valid for every jailbroken device on iOS 5.0.1, except for iPhone 3GS old bootrom.
* If you’ve already installed Corona, simply open up Cydia and update to the latest version. If you haven’t jailbroken your device yet, we recommend you use RedSn0w, which will provide you with a one-stop untether jailbreak.
* For more information about the Corona untether, please check out our detailed guide.
* As usual, make sure to read your jailbreak page for answers to all your questions about jailbreaking.
