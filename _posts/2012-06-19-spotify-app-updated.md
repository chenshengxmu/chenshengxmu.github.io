* Spotify, the popular Swedish music streaming startup, has released an update for its iOS app today that includes a killer new Pandora-like radio feature.
* Users will be able to create radio stations based on genre, artists or track-style, and can further customize them via a thumbs up/down ratings system…
* The free radio feature has been available on desktops since late last year, but the fact that it’s now available on mobile devices is a huge win for users. Up until now, you essentially had to be a paying customer to use Spotify’s service on the go.
* On top of the new radio option, the app also includes a handful of bug fixes. So whether you’re a current subscriber or not, it’s worth checking out.
* If you’re interested, you can find Spotify in the App Store for free.
* Have you tried Spotify’s radio feature yet? What do you think?
