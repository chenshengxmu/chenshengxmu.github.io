* Last year, car maker Bentley produced a documentary video to promote its $300,000 Mulsanne, using specialized accessories and a few App Store apps to shoot and edit the promotional film entirely on the iPhone 5s and iPads.
* Now Bentley has upgraded to the latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets to shoot a new short film, officially part of Bentley’s ‘Intelligent Details’ series, with a little help from stabilized camera systems, professional lenses and filters and apps like FiLMiC Pro.
* Using both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices, the latter featuring optical image stabilization, the teams tapped the FiLMiC Pro app to achieve a film-like look.
* I wouldn’t try this at home: here we have a team of Hollywood professionals lead by director Austin Reza who applied their movie-making skills to getting the most out of the iPhone’s camera.

* Titled ‘Intelligent Details: The Bespoke Driving Jacket’ and commissioned by Bentley Motors, it features four houses from Savile Row, the internationally renowned home of bespoke tailoring, as they each create a Bespoke Driving Jacket, commissioned by Bentley Motors to mark the occasion of the Savile Row Bespoke exhibition in Washington, D.C.
* Check it out below.
* As mentioned before, they used specialized equipment and accessories ranging from a number of professional lenses to steadicam like mounts. And here’s a behind-the-scenes clip providing more details on the production process and the type of specialized gear used in filming the promotional video.
* Specifically, the team used the MoVI M5 camera stabilizer in conjunction with a BeastGrip Pro to mount professional lenses, such as anamorphic lens from Moondog Labs, onto the iPhones.
