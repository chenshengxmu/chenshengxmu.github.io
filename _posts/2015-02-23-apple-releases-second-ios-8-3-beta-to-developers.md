* Apple has seeded iOS 8.3 beta 2 to developers, now available to download over-the-air or from the Developer Center. Along with the iOS software, Apple has also seeded Xcode 6.3 beta 2 with Swift 1.2 for developers to begin using with their apps and a new beta for the Apple TV.
* iOS 8.3 beta 2 follows the release of the first beta close to two weeks ago. Apple is expected to release iOS 8.3 to the public sometime around the launch of the Apple Watch.
* The first iOS 8.3 beta brought users CarPlay support, new emojis, support for Google 2-step verification, and the beginnings to bring Apple Pay to China.
* The release notes for iOS 8.3 beta 2 say the release fixes the dialog that appears when connecting an iPhone to a CarPlay-compatible car.
* Apple continues to focus on inclusivity: iOS 8.3 has 300 new emoji, including diversity, and 32 new country flags! pic.twitter.com/bVkDEDLM6b
