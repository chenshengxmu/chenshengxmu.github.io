* Instagram is testing some new features, like a Usage Insights option, a new sidebar and more.
* Usage Insights, first discovered by developer Jane Manchun Wong (via PunikaWeb) in Instagram for Android, is currently being tested by the app developers internally. The hidden feature will show you the amount of time you’ve spent on the mobile Instagram app.
* As such, it could be of particular interest to parents or people who would welcome some help in curing their Instagram addiction. Furthermore, the Android app now swooshes an all-new sidebar menu into view when you hit the hamburger icon.
* The sidebar menu, a first for Instagram, includes shortcuts to contextual features such as your archive, saved posts, the Discover People feature and more. Wong has made similar discoveries, too, including a new button for sharing a story to Facebook with a single tap.
* Instagram is testing a button that shares a story to Facebook on one tap

* It also looks Instagram is testing a Request Verification button for Business Accounts in the settings page, plus a “Your account is private” label on top of profiles to indicate whether a person’s profile is private, a rounder-looking Direct Message composer with emoji, uploading multiple photos/videos to a Story at once, rainbow hearts, stickers, hashtag stickers and location stickers for live videos for 2018 Pride Month and other perks.
* Last but not least, more detailed muting capabilities are coming as soon you’ll be able to mute a follower’s posts or Stories (or both) right from their profile.
* Are you addicted to Instagram?
