* Spotify is getting in the holiday spirit, announcing Wednesday that users can grab its Premium offering at only $0.99 for the first three months. Not a shabby deal. 
* While a free version of Spotify is available with advertisements, the Premium version truly unlocks all of the music streaming service’s power. Premium lets you play any song at anytime, listen when you’re offline, and hear music without advertisements.
* Spotify is offering the deal until December 31, and it only applies to users who have never signed up for Premium before. Following the first three months, users can pay the $9.99/month fee to continue. Students with a .edu email get a break, only having to pay $4.99.
