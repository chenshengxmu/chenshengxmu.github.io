* Once iOS 5 was officially released to the public, it was like a flood of Notification Center jailbreak tweaks hit Cydia all at once. It was so much at one time that it was hard to wade through it all.
* Now that the flood has finally turned into a manageable stream, we figured it was the appropriate time to highlight some of our favorite Notification Center jailbreak widgets yet…
* This is more of a tweak to the widget interface, than a widget itself, but it’s still very useful. NotificationCenter Enhancer allows you to add additional lines of text to Notification Center enabling you to read full emails and long SMS messages.
* Call, email and text your favorites directly from the convenience of Notification Center. An excellent widget that pulls in the info from your Phone app’s favorites.
* The most robust system stats widget available on Cydia.
* This is probably my favorite Notification Center tweak out there. It allows you to receive banner notifications when you play a new song on the Music app. Very useful.
* Did you really think I’d make this list without including what is arguably one of the most important jailbreak apps of all time? With the iOS 5 update, SBSettings can now reside in the comforts of the Notification Center. It just makes sense.
* Of course that’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Notification Center widgets. For a full run down of some of the other widgets you might find on Cydia, head over to our Notification Center section, and have at it.
* Did your favorite widget make the list?
