* Joining the guessing game ahead of Apple’s iPad event tomorrow, The Wall Street Journal in a story yesterday evening has corroborated the rumor-mill reporting by throwing its credibility behind the reports calling for a fifth-generation 9.7-inch iPad with a thinner and lighter appearance, as well as a second-generation iPad mini with the Retina display.
* The iPad 5, the report states, will adopt a new kind of display technology which allows for a much thinner display assembly. Go past the fold for the full reveal…
* WSJ writes:
* Apple is now readying a revamped iPad Mini with a high-resolution “retina” display. It’s also working on a thinner, lighter version of its standard 9.7-inch iPad, using a thin film instead of the glass found in existing models, based on information from the company’s parts suppliers.
* Calling it “the world’s best-selling tablet computer”, WSJ notes that the iPad mini is estimated to account for nearly two of every three iPads sold.
* The well-informed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks both new iPads will share the same eight-megapixel iSight camera on the back, with the iPad 5 running the Apple-designed A7X chip, an improved version of the iPhone 5s’s A7 silicon with faster graphics.
* The iPad mini, Kuo conjures up, will run the A7 chip  and have the Retina display, like the rumors have predicted, but cautioned the iPad mini 2 will be tough to find at launch time.
* As for Touch ID, Kuo doesn’t expect Apple to include the fingerprint sensor, nor a gold color option, in either iPad line this year, because components for these features are reportedly still being prioritized for the iPhone 5s, limiting supplies.
* Previous reports speculated Touch ID should be on tap for the full-size iPad.
* Apple’s event kicks off at 10am PST tomorrow and we’ll be reporting major developments and tidbits throughout the day. For a comprehensive look at what to expect from the event, check out Cody’s nice roundup.
