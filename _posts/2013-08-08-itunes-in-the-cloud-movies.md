* Apple has rolled out movie support for its iTunes in the Cloud service to a number of new countries this morning. The list features Japan and seven additional European countries including Italy, Lithuania, Austria and Spain.
* For those unfamiliar with the service, it allows you to stream and re-download previously purchased iTunes content on all of your registered iOS devices. It’s available for all content, but today’s rollout is restricted to movies…
* Here’s the full list of new countries (via MacRumors):
* Movies for iTunes in the Cloud works just like apps and music do. Essentially, any movies (with a few exceptions) you’ve previously purchased through iTunes should be re-downloadable on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.
* So if you live in one of the aforementioned countries, and have purchased movies in iTunes before, try re-downloading them by visiting the Purchased tab. And be sure to let us know if it’s working for you down in the comments.
