* Apple on Friday released four new ads for the LTE-outfitted Apple Watch Series 3 model.
* Available through its official YouTube channel, these short videos promote Series 3 LTE watch as the perfect gift for the active types this holiday season. The videos, running just fifteen seconds long each, focus on specific activities and sports that Apple Watch Series 3 makes more enjoyable with its fitness and health-optimized capabilities.
* And here they are.
* Song: “Water Me” by Lizzo
* Song: “Bom Bom” by Tkay Maidza & Danny L Harle
* Song: “Pa La Calle (feat. Lorna)” by Mexican Institute of Sound
* Song: “Blast Off” by Nicky Blitz
* The Cupertino giant is also promoting AirPods and Apple Music in another holiday ad that shows off a spectacular dance performance in the snow. Earlier this week, Apple began publishing how-to videos through its all-new YouTube channel dedicated to iOS tips and tricks.
