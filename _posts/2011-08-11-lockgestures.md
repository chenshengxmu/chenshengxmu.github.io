* “Soon we’ll need﻿ a lockscreen for our lockscreen,” states a comment on our YouTube video for LockGestures. Frankly, I couldn’t have said it better myself.
* LockGestures is a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone and/or iPad that takes the “lock” out of the lockscreen. It’s a tweak that adds a plethora of multi-touch gestures right on the area that used to be solely reserved for unlocking your device.
* Now, you can do everything on the lockscreen — launch apps, adjust power options, even make a sandwich. Okay, so I’m just kidding about the sandwich part, but you get the idea. Check inside to see the full scope of LockGestures in high definition video glory…
* If you’re interested in adding additional functionality to the somewhat boring lockscreen, you can pony up $1 and download LockGestures today from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. As always, you’ll need a jailbroken device in order to do so.
* What do you think about LockGestures? Good idea, or do you believe they’re treading into sacred territory that shouldn’t be messed around with?
