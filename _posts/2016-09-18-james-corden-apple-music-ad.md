* Apple on Sunday night aired a new Apple Music ad during the 2016 Emmy Awards starring “Late Late Show” host James Corden. The spot is called “The all-new Apple Music,” and it highlights the content and discovery features of the company’s streaming service.
* In the humorous clip, Corden pitches Apple Music commercial ideas to executives Jimmy Iovine, Eddy Cue and Bozoma Saint John. As you can imagine, most of Corden’s concepts are off-the-wall, and in the end the team decides the collaboration isn’t going to work.
* Apple has released several ads over the past week, including Go Time, Morning Ride and Midnight. It has also been working closely with James Corden as of late, developing an introduction video for its iPhone 7 event based on his hit Carpool Karaoke segment.
* Apple Music is free to try for 3-months and then costs $4.99/month for students, $9.99 for individuals and $14.99 for families.
