* Major League Baseball announced yesterday that it will be tripling the number of ballparks that accept digital tickets stored and presented through Apple’s Passbook iOS app this season.
* This is a fairly big deal, considering that only 4 stadiums supported Passbook ticketing last year. Now nearly 50% of all of them will. Keep reading for a complete list of the new ballparks…
* As noted by GigaOm, the following teams will support Passbook this season:
* Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics and Pittsburgh Pirates join the San Francisco Giants, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals
* Additionally, the MLB said that three other teams have committed to the digital ticketing program, but they are not ready to make an announcement yet. It’s hoping they will by opening day.
* The League has been at the forefront of Apple’s Passbook platform since it debuted with iOS 6 last fall, and has seen impressive results. It says Passbook accounted for 12% of e-tickets last year.
* Anyway, for those of you who live near one of the above-mentioned parks, you can actually purchase tickets through the MLB’s At Bat application. And it will automatically add them to Passbook for you.
* I sure wish other organizations and companies were taking advantage of Apple’s ticketing platform like this. There’s only one place near me that is right now, a movie theatre, and it’s 45 miles away.
