* Hundreds of iPhone X owners have been complaining recently about an unusual bug that’s causing them to miss incoming calls because the handset’s OLED display won’t wake, preventing the call from being answered.
* The Financial Times on Monday highlighted this issue, which prevents the caller ID for an incoming call to be shown for a significant time, as did Indian blog PiunikaWeb.
* We’ve seen similar reports on Reddit and Twitter as well. Users report the issue continues to exist even in the latest iOS 11.2.5 software. Apple’s confirmed it’s “looking into these reports.”
* Both outlets linked their reports to a few threads on Apple’s Support Communities forum where hundreds of disgruntled users are complaining about the iPhone X screen delay, which in some cases can last for ten seconds when a phone call comes in.
* For others, the delay can be up to a minute.
* @AppleSupport iPhone X – there is a display response delay when getting an incoming call … what are the possible solutions ?

* “ Whenever I receive an incoming call in my iPhone X, ringtones start but the display comes in after 6-8 seconds,” says one user on Apple’s support forum.
* “I can often not see an incoming call coming, can only hear it! At other times, there is a significant delay,” reads another post.
* The affected units still ring when a call comes but because the touchscreen won’t wake on time the user is unable to tap button on the screen required to accept or reject the call.
* Last week, Axios said Apple has made the decision to delay major new features in iOS 12 and macOS 10.14 in order to focus on underlying performance and reliability.
* Making and receiving calls normally is a pretty basic feature that even a $10 phone can manage so here’s hoping that Apple takes this issue seriously and deliver a timely fix for it.
* Have you been hit by this unusual bug?
