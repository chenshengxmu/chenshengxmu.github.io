* iOS’s Reachability feature is a nice addition for those who wish to operate their iPhone with just one hand. With Reachability, customers can easily reach the top corners of the iOS user interface by double-tapping the Home screen button.
* I use Reachability on a regular basis, but wish that more developers designed their apps with one-handed mode in mind. For instance, one-handed zooming is currently available in just a few apps, such as Google Maps and Snapchat.
* On Apple Maps, you’ve always had the ability to zoom in or out of an area using the familiar pinch-zoom gesture. What you may not know is that Apple’s mapping application provides other gestures that are suitable for zooming in or out without needing to pinch open or close with two fingers, here’s how.
* 1) Launch Apple Maps on your iOS device.

* 1) Open the Apple Maps app on your Mac.
