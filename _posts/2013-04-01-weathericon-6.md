* Rejoice, ladies and gentlemen, because WeatherIcon is back and it brings support for iOS 6 in tow. Aptly dubbed WeatherIcon 6, this jailbreak tweak brings live weather updates to jailbroken iOS 6 devices.
* Like its predecessor, this tweak ditches the static “73 degrees and sunny” located on the stock Weather app icon, in favor of live up-to-date weather conditions. One thing you won’t find in WeatherIcon 6 is support for status bar weather information, but the developer says that a future update to a dependency will bring status bar support soon.
* If you’ve been dying to bring live weather updates to your Weather app icon, but you’re running iOS 6, then try WeatherIcon 6. There are no options or settings to configure, just install it and go.
* WeatherIcon 6 is a free download from Cydia’s ModMyi Repo. Be sure to let me know what you think about it in the comments section below.
