* Following today’s announcement of the iMac with Retina 5K display, the machine is now available for purchase on Apple.com. Starting at $2,499, the base iMac with Retina 5K display model comes with a 3.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i5,  8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM, an AMD Radeon R9 M290X with 2GB of dedicated GDDR5 video memory for superior graphics performance, and a 1TB Fusion Drive.
* Of course, the machine can be upgraded for screaming performances, but the basics should just do for anyone. Anyone that can afford it of course.
* This new iMac is currently only available online and is scheduled to ship within 1 to 3 business days. These shipping estimates are likely to slip if the machine proves to be popular. It’s fair to assume that the new iMacs will be available in stores in the next day or two as well.
* This is pretty much my dream machine here so I’ll be quick to buy one. What about you?
