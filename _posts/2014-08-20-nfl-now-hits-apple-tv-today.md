* As expected, the National Football League launched the Apple TV client for its new ‘NFL Now’ service this morning. The service went live earlier this month on mobile and various streaming devices, and today it comes to Apple’s set top box.
* While the NFL Now channel won’t deliver streams of live games (see NFL Sunday Ticket for that), it will provide a plethora of content for football fans. That content includes classic and recent highlights, breaking news, press events and more…
* Here’s the description of the iOS app, which you can find in the App Store here:
* NFL Now delivers a personalized video stream of your favorite NFL teams, players and coaches right to your iPad or iPhone. Get exclusive interviews and stories about your team, breaking news on your fantasy players, and unlimited access to your favorites in the NFL Films Archives.
* This official NFL product combines all of the intense football you love with a smart, easy-to-use interface. NFL Now for the iPhone and iPad learns what you like and delivers a non-stop stream of customized NFL content gathered just for you. Don’t waste another minute of this season! Get more of the NFL you love with NFL Now.
* Users will be able to customize their streams so they’ll only see content about the players and teams they care about. They’ll also get to hundreds of new videos daily, ranging from game highlights, to commentary, and even live press conferences.
* NFL Now comes in two flavors: one free and one that costs $1.99 per month ($4.99 for folks outside of US, Mexico, and UK). The free option gives you access to most of the content, but the Pro package adds in NFL RedZone streams, and more.
* As usual, no update is needed to see this new channel. Just restart your Apple TV if you’re not seeing it yet.
