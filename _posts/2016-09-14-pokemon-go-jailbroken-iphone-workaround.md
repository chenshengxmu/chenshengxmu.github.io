* The latest Pokémon GO update blocks jailbreakers from using the game in a move to crack down on third-party apps and tweaks that harvest data for Pokémon tracking and cheating.
* Of course, not all jailbreakers cheat in Pokémon GO, so it’s a pretty harsh assumption on their part, so in this piece, we’ll discuss how you can run Pokémon GO on your jailbroken device even if you have the latest update.
* When Pokémon GO checks to see if you’re jailbroken, the app is going to just crash if it determines that you are. Fortunately, there’s a new patch in the form of a jailbreak tweak that can spoof this check so that Pokémon GO doesn’t actually know you’re jailbroken.
* It’s called xCon for PokemonGo, and to get it, you’re going to need to add a new third-party repository to Cydia. To do that, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch Cydia on your jailbroken device and open the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button.
* 3) Tap on the Add button.
* 4) Enter the following URL in the Cydia URL text field:
* http://beta.unlimapps.com/
* 5) Tap on the Add Source button.
* 6) After the source is loaded into Cydia, tap on the Return to Cydia button.
* Now that you have the repository loaded into Cydia on your device, all you need to do is search for xCon for PokemonGo and install it.

* After you’ve installed this tweak, you can try to load the Pokémon GO app, and this time it shouldn’t crash following the splash screen.
* Please note that alternative patch methods that have worked in previous versions of Pokémon GO, like Masterball, no longer work. Niantic has a new jailbreak detection method, which is why an entirely new jailbreak tweak was required for this patch.
* If you’re not already playing Pokémon GO, and are interested in trying it out, you can download it for free from the App Store today.
