* It’s a common sight for App Store developers to bar jailbreakers from using their apps. As frustrating as this can be, jailbreak developers regularly find ways around these jailbreak detection methods and publish them in the form of jailbreak tweaks.
* One of the latest of such tweaks to hit Cydia is Citrix Receiver Unblock by iOS developer Christoph Kolbicz, which permits the Citrix Receiver app to work as anticipated on jailbroken devices.
* Before installing Citrix Receiver Unblock, jailbreakers could expect to see a prompt like the one presented above. As it would seem, Citrix considers jailbroken devices to be too insecure for using their app, so they merely lock jailbreakers out.
* After installing Citrix Receiver Unblock, however, jailbreakers can launch the Citrix Receiver app all they want and use it to their heart’s content without ever noticing prompts of this nature.
* Citrix Receiver Unblock doesn’t have any options to configure, so you’re ultimately ready to go after installing the tweak.
* One thing worth noting is that the Citrix Receiver developers could easily patch this workaround in a forthcoming update. Kolbicz indicates in the Cydia description that the tweak works for version 7.3 of the Citrix Receiver Unblock app, which is a free download in the App Store, but if it ever gets patched, the developer will need to refresh his tweak to operate correctly.
* If you’re curious about trying Citrix Receiver Unblock, it’s available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Are you happy to see a way for jailbreakers to use the Citrix Receiver Unblock app? Share in the comments section below.
