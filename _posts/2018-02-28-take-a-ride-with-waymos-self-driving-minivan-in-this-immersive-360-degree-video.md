* Today, Waymo has the world’s first and only fleet of fully self-driving cars on public roads.
* In case you’ve been sleeping under a rock lately, Waymo is an autonomous car development company and subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Waymo’s been working on self-driving car technology since their early days at Google in 2009 and has now self-driven over 5 million miles, a remarkable achievement.
* To celebrate the accomplishment, they’ve created an awesome 360-degree video that gives you the chance to take control of the camera and see through the “eyes” of one of Waymo’s fully driverless minivans.
* The video also showcases an engineering tool, called x-view, that displays what the self-driving car “sees” all around it. You can see firsthand what it means to have millions of data points surrounding you in all directions at any given moment.
* The laser visualization in the video presents a simplified view of the LiDAR data collected by our sensors. The radar animation illustrates how these sensors bounce radar waves off surrounding objects to gauge their position and speed.
* The traffic lights in the camera scene are examples of visible objects that were detected by our high-resolution cameras. The predictions of what each pedestrian, cyclist or vehicle will do next in the video are based off real-time predictions made by our self-driving software.
* Check out Waymo’s impressive self-driving experience right below.
* Here’s how to explore the video in 360-degree freedom:
* This cool experience, created in partnership with Google Creative Lab, was built using footage and real-time data from an actual trip on city streets. To learn more about how it was made, check out Waymo’s Medium post.

* Basically, to create an authentic representation of self-driving technology, they began by driving on the streets of Metro Phoenix, Arizona with one of their self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. The data from those trips served as the basis of the 360-degree video.
* Waymo’s first million miles took six years to complete.

* As mentioned, Waymo is test-driving its driverless vehicles on public roads without anyone in the driver’s seat. The Arizona Department of Transportation recently approved Waymo’s application to operate as a transportation network in the state. That is seen as a crucial step towards a ride-hailing service based on driverless cards that will compete directly with Uber.
* “After more than eight years of testing and development, we’re ready to unlock the potential of fully self-driving technology, so we can make it easier and safer for everyone to get around,” according to Waymo.
* The company claims that members of the public will get to use these cars in their daily lives sooner than later. Fun fact: Waymo is now driving as many miles in one day as the average American adult drives in a whole year.
* As mentioned, the Waymo odometer rolled over to 5,000,000 in February.
