* As the weather gets warmer and the days grow longer, the night sky becomes a new and exciting place to explore. We may not be able to hop on our bikes and ride around the Milky Way, but we can find a dark place out of the city to go on a visual hike.

* When I was little, it seemed like my dad knew everything. I’d ask him who painted that pretty picture of the boy in a blue suit and he’d know. I never thought I’d be as smart as him and thanks to technology I don’t have to be. This app tells you the name of every star, planet, and constellation that you can see in the sky by holding your device up to it. Using your iPhone’s GPS tracking and internal compass, you can view the stars above you with augmented reality. When little Jimmy asks you where the North Star is, you can find it easily with this informative app. This app is available for $0.99.

* I’ve always thought of the iPhone, and smartphones in general, as the realization of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I mean, the knowledge of the entire universe in the palm of your hand? Yep. Well, if you have Pocket Universe on your iPhone, you’re that much closer to having the knowledge of the entire universe, at least as we understand it. Not only can you use augmented reality to stare up at the night sky, complete with names and information on each star, but you can also go for a virtual walk on the moon and explore our solar system without leaving the house. This app is available for $2.99.

* If Duran Duran says it’s good, than it has to be special. Star Walk was one of the first, and most popular stargazing apps in the App Store and still boasts millions of downloads today. You can see the stars above you with augmented reality, check out the Picture of the Day for a great shot of a star, see the sky as it was a decade ago and will be a decade from now, and see what astronomical events will take place this year. Sky Walk is even AirPlay supported so you can capture the night sky and share it with everyone in the room for a real hands-on astronomy class. This app is available for $2.99.

See changes to the sky with time-lapse animation, check lunar phases, see deep sky objects and learn about constellations, solar systems, and more. The best part of this app is that you don’t need the Internet to use it. This app is available for $3.99.
