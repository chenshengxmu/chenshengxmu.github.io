* Apple debuted the Retina display in June 2010 on the iPhone 4. Fast-forward to today and it remains the gold standard for smartphones in terms of crispness and pixel density. Yes, most high-end Android handsets now top the iPhone’s 960-by-480 pixel resolution by way of using bigger panels that however don’t always introduce denser pixel.
* A good example is Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus smartphone which has a 4.65-inch display with the native HD resolution of 1,280-by-720 pixels and a pixel density of 316 pixels per inch (ppi), safely above the Retina requirement of at least 300ppi for a smartphone display so the pixels appear indistinguishable to the human eye with a 20/20 vision.
* Enter LG’s newly-announced five-inch mobile display. It rocks a whopping 1,920-by-1,080 pixel resolution and an astounding density of 440 pixels per inch. If Apple was looking for the perfect display for its rumored five-inch iOS device, this could be it…
* LG Display, which originally started out in 1999 as a joint venture by LG Electronics and Koninklijke Philips Electronic, yesterday introduced a five-inch smartphone display sporting an impressive pixel density of 440ppi.
* The official press release (via Engadget) hails it as “the highest-resolution mobile panel to date”. Specifically, it supports full HD resolution of 1,920-by-1,080 pixels natively.
* Think about it: for the first time, you’ll be able to enjoy full HD TV on your smartphone, no downsampling required whatsoever.
* Compared to the preceding 4.5-inch panel featuring a 1,280-by-720 pixel resolution at 329ppi, the new display has 1.3 times better ppi and 2.2 times denser pixels. Better yet, it features a 16:9 aspect ratio – perfect for watching movies as they were meant to be enjoyed.
* The display uses a variant of In-Plane Switching technology (IPS) known as Advanced High Performance In-Plane Switching (AH-IPS). Compared to IPS, AH-IPS boasts wide viewing angles, fast response times and improved brightness efficiency.
* With the high density of AH-IPS, the naked eye is unable to distinguish between individual pixels. AH-IPS panels also express the original color of images highly precisely, and feature a wide viewing angle as well as stable display image and rapid response speed when touched. Finally, with its brighter light transmission and lower power consumption, AH-IPS is ideal for use in outdoor settings.
* So, when’s this thing going to be available?
* Pretty soon, during the second half of this year.
* Now, a few things worth mentioning.
* Firstly, the Seoul, South Korea-headquartered company files as the world’s largest LCD panel maker, ahead of Samsung Electronics in a slender lead.
* LG Display is one of the main licensed vendors of Hitachi-developed IPS panels found in iMacs, iPads, iPhones and iPod touches. It’s also believed to be providing smaller quantities of the 2,048-by-1,536 pixel resolution Retina displays for the iPad 3.
* When iPhone meets Note: some folks think Apple shouldn’t sit on the sidelines and watch Samsung take the phablet market for itself. Comic credit: Joy of Tech.

* And if the Wall Street Journal is to be trusted, LG Display will also supply display technology for the next iPhone, along with Sony, Sharp and Japan Display, a new company born out of the partnership between the Japanese government and Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba.
* A sixth-generation iPhone is said to feature in-cell technology that combines color filter and touch sensor components into one, making for a substantially thinner display.
* Conspicuously, Samsung has not been identified as a supplier, fueling rumors of orders stoppage on Apple’s part.
* If you ask me, LG Display’s new darling is the perfect fit for that rumored five-inch iOS device that Japanese blog Macotakara says Apple’s been working on. The report speculates a five-inch iOS device would feature either a 1,600-by-960 pixel display or a 1,280-by-960 variant.

* But with LG Display, one of Apple’s key suppliers of mobile displays, now mainstreaming this new astounding display, I really don’t see Cupertino settling for anything else but the full HD mobile display.
* Apple could also use Sharp’s Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) display technology which has been given a boost when Apple’s contract manufacturer Foxconn acquired an eleven percent stake in Sharp and its cutting-edge display plant.
* The only problem at the moment are yield rates and ongoing manufacturing problems making mass production of IGZO displays difficult for the time being.
* Again, this is only speculation on my part. For all we know, this five-inch iOS device could easily be the product of someone’s imagination.
* If it does exist in Apple’s labs, I’m wondering whether it’s an oversized iPod touch or a brand new device meant to challenge Samsung’s Galaxy Note phablet.
* Either way, I’d put my money on Apple using this beauty of a display from LG Display.
* A five-inch iPhone, you say?
* Perhaps, though the overwhelming majority of our readers said in a poll that four inches should be the new gold standard for iPhones going forward. This is in stark contrast to less than three percent of polled readers preferring a screen of five inches and beyond.
* Now, some folks think I’m stretching it.
* I welcome everyone’s opinion, but arguing that the Galaxy Note’s concept is broken doesn’t change the fact that people love the form factor.
* Whether or not Apple chooses to address it is anybody’s guess.
* Here’s a guy making a phone call on a 5.3-inch Galaxy Note. I too happen to think that wielding a phablet in public makes one look stupid, but who’s to say that Apple isn’t thinking about a five-inch iOS entertainment device of sorts?

* And whilst most patents never make it into actual products, it’s worth pointing out that Apple filed for multiple patents related to pen technology.
* Last Wednesday, the site Patently Apple pointed at a new Apple patent application for an iPen, a vibrating pen that makes noise.
* Mike Elgan has an excellent take on what the iPen could mean for Apple in the bigger scheme of things.
* Thoughts?
