* Hot on the heels of launching transit directions in New Orleans ahead of Mardi Gras and real-time traffic conditions in Argentina, Apple Maps has now gained directions for various public transportation options in Detroit and Windsor. Customers in the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area and those living in the Canadian city of Windsor, Ontario can now navigate using public transportation such as buses and trains with Apple Maps for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.
* In the Detroit area, Apple Maps support the following public commute options:
* As noted by MacRumors, limited navigation extends to a number of Detroit suburbs in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne Counties, including Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Pontiac, Sterling Heights and Warren.
* In the Windsor, Ontario area, Apple Maps supports Transit Windsor buses, with navigation extending to Essex County suburbs like Tecumseh.
* In addition, Tunnel Bus routing is available for cross-border trips between Windsor and select locations in the Metro Detroit area.
* iOS Feature Availability webpage lists all markets where transit directions are available.
