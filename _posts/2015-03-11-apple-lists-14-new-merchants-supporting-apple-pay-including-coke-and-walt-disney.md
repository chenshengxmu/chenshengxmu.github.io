* Apple has updated its list of merchants that support Apple Pay to include 14 new stores, most notably including Coca-Cola and Walt Disney World, as the Cupertino-based company works to grow its mobile payments service.
* Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, highlighted that Coca-Cola Vending was adding Apple Pay support during the company’s “Spring Forward” media event on Monday. Cook said the beverage-giant currently has 40,000 Apple Pay-compatible machines and plans to bring that number to 100,000 by the end of 2015.
* The full list of the 14 new stores added on Wednesday: Bashas’, Coca-Cola Vending, Dan’s Fresh Market, Dick’s Fresh Market, Fudruckers, Jamba Juice, Jersey Mike’s, JetBlue, Lin’s Fresh Market, Maceys, Office Max, Pep Boys, Regal Cinemas, and Walt Disney World.
* The additions bring a total of 61 supporting stores for Apple Pay. Are there any stores you’re dying to see?
* For Apple Pay to catch on, it’s key for retailers to support the service. Apple Pay already has plenty of banks signed on to support customer’s credit and debit cards, but now it’s about adding retailers for customers to use their iPhones and Apple Watch to pay for goods and services.
* On Wednesday, Apple also added L.L. Bean to the “coming soon” section, along with Acme, Albertsons, Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, who have been on the list for months.
