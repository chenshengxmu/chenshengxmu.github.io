* It looks like Apple will provide a live stream of today’s iPad event after all as Apple TV owners report that the Apple Events channel has been updated on their $99 set-top box to reflect Apple’s invitation graphics.
* “Watch the special event held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in San Francisco, CA,” the event listing reads.
* Additionally, the company will be live-streaming the show to iOS devices and Macs through the new October 2013 event section on its Apple Events web page…
* According to Apple, live streaming video requires Safari 4 or later on OS X v10.6 or later or Safari on iOS 4.2 or later. Streaming via Apple TV is supported on the second or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.

* Apple typically live-streams major events, but not as a rule of thumb.
* Last month’s double iPhone announcement, for example, wasn’t live-streamed so fans had to wait for the video replay to go live a few hours after the event had wrapped up.
