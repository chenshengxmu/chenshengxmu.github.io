title: Virtual keyboard in iOS 6 now finally capitalizes after quotes and emoji

* Here’s another small but useful tweak in iOS 6 which went under our radar: the virtual keyboard is now clever enough to capitalize after quotes and emoji.
* Previously, when you started or ended a quote or ended your sentence with emoji followed by a period, the keyboard wouldn’t switch to capitals.
* iOS 6 tweaks its virtual keyboard’s behavior, now capitalizing after quotes and emojis, just as you’d expect…
* Killian Bell over at Cult of Mac spotted this minor, but surely welcome change:
* When you start or end a quote in iOS 6, the keyboard automatically switches to capital letters after the first and last quotation marks – you no longer need to hit shift and do it manually.
* Furthermore, if you add emoji after a sentence and you ended that sentence with a period, the keyboard will switch to capitals here, too.
* Though some of you won’t bother, to me this is another welcome feature in the already strong arsenal of auto-correct keyboard features in iOS.
* Usually when I’m typing my iMessages, text messages, email messages and whatever other form of quick communication you can think of, I pay attention to my punctuation and grammar as if I were writing a blog post.
* iOS 6 also bring an array of new emojis. For the full run-down of all little and big new features in iOS 6, check out Cody’s quick overview of everything that’s new in iOS 6.
* So, how do you like this little nice-to-have?
