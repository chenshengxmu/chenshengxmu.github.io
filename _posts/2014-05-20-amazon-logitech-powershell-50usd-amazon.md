* Logitech’s PowerShell iOS 7 controller has been heavily criticized for its high launch price ($99) and there have been some complaints about build quality and features. But if you’re serious about iOS gaming, you should consider this accessory as a worthy first entrant into the iOS 7 controller market.
* Gamers who have been on the lookout for a nice deal on the PowerShell are in for a treat as Amazon is currently offering the accessory for just $49.99, with free shipping included. That’s a nice 29 percent discount over the online retailer’s normal asking price of $69.99 and a cool $50 savings from its suggested (and rather insane) retail price of ninety-nine bucks…
* You can find the Amazon listing for the PowerShell here.
* The accessory has a built-in 1500 mAh battery that charges your iOS device when docked and includes your regular action buttons, in addition to shoulder bumpers and a directional pad. An adapter allowing you to connect headphones to the accessory ships included.
* If you’d rather buy some other controller, consider Razer’s upcoming Kazuyo MFi controller, SteelSeries by Stratus or Moga’s accessory.
* If you have tried one of  the available iOS 7 controllers, I’d appreciate if you could kindly share your impressions with fellow readers down in the comment section.
