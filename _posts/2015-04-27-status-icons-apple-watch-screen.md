* Although the Apple Watch doesn’t feature a traditional status bar like the iPhone or the iPad, from time to time you will notice a status indicator icon at the top of the screen. Apple Watch contains a variety of status indicator icons, and they all mean different things. In this post, we’ll talk about some of the status icons that you may encounter during your usage of Apple’s new wearable.
* As noted, status icons at the top of the screen give you information about Apple Watch. Many of these status indicators appear on the watch face and while within apps. None of the indicators will display while at the Home screen Carousel interface. Here are the icons that you may encounter, along with a description of what they mean:
*   Notification: Appears for unread notifications. This indicator only appears on the watch face, and not within other apps.
*  Charging: Indicates that Apple Watch is charging.
*  Lock: Your Apple Watch is locked using a passcode.
*  Do Not Disturb: Calls and alerts won’t emit an audible sound or illuminate the screen, but alarms still will.
*  Airplane Mode: Non-wireless features available, but all wireless radios are disabled.
*   Disconnected from your iPhone: Your Apple Watch has disconnected with its paired iPhone.
*  Loading: Wireless activity or an active process is happening.
* Although these icons are similar to the ones found on iOS, it may take a while to completely familiarize yourself with their location and their meaning. The more you use Apple Watch, the more you will get familiar with these indicators and be ready to take action where appropriate.
* What are you thoughts on the way that the Apple Watch handles status bar icons? Do you like it? Do you think it should be more like iOS on the iPhone or iPad? Sound off down below with your comments.
