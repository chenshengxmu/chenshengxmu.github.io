* On Wednesday, Apple introduced its fourth-generation Apple Watch. Long-rumored, the wearable device comes in 40mm and 44mm varieties and is packed with new watch faces. 
* The new Apple Watch includes a new watch face, like the one previously rumored that includes nine complications. There’s also a revised Modular watch face. Additionally, the Breathe app is now available as three separate watch faces. When using these, you simply raise your wrist to begin a breathing session.
* The Breathe faces are called fire, water, and vapor and each includes dynamic visuals behind the watch hands.
