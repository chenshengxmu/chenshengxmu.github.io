* Appleâ€™s iTunes U application has received a refresh in the App Store, bringing out a few new features. For starters, iTunes U 3.3 for iOS now takes advantage of third-party Document Provider extensions.
* This enables iPhone, iPod touch and iPad owners to easily add new materials from various cloud services for which they have an app installed on their device, such as iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox and so forth.
* iTunes 3.3 also lets you import managed class rosters from the Apple School Manager and it will guide students to specific iTunes U Courses from the Classroom app.
* And in addition to minor performance and stability improvements, this edition of iTunes U allows Explain Everything and Notability project files to be used as course materials or hand-ins from students.
* Grab iTunes U for free from the App Store.
