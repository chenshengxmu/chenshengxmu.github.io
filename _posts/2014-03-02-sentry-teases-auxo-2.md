title: Auxo 2 teased in videos
---
* In October 2012, we posted a few images from a concept by an up-and-coming designer called “Rethinking the App Switcher for the iPhone 5.” As the name suggested, the concept offered a different take on the then-bottom-loading app switcher.
* That designer’s name was Sentry, who is now one of the most well-known figures in the jailbreak community, and that concept went on to become Auxo, perhaps one of the most popular tweaks of all time. And yes, folks, a sequel is on the way…
* Over the weekend, Sentry posted screenshots and videos for the highly-anticipated Auxo 2 jailbreak tweak, which has been completely rebuilt for iOS 7. The photo above and the two Vine videos embedded below show what it looks like in action.
* For those unfamiliar with Auxo, it’s a tweak that extended the functionality of the app switcher in iOS 5 and iOS 6 by adding thumbnail-sized app screenshots, music controls and Settings toggles. It was conceptualized and designed by Sentry and developed by Jack Willis.You can read our full review of the first Auxo here.
* As for Auxo 2, we don’t know much yet besides the fact that it is now being coded by @QusicS, still under the design supervision of Sentry. It definitely looks interesting, but as for new features or how well it plays with the new app switcher, we’ll have to wait and see. There’s no ETA for the tweak yet, but Sentry says it should launch this month.
