* Apple has slashed its iPhone battery replacement service fee to $29 from $79 after admitting to slowing down older models with worn-out batteries, but those looking to take advantage of the offer should know that the discounted pricing is limited to one repair per device.
* According to new fine print on Apple’s iPhone Service Pricing webpage, which was discovered yesterday by MacRumros, the advertised $29 battery service fee “may be limited to one repair per iPhone” when an eligible device passes diagnostic test.
* As the publication notes, this means that after you’ve had your iPhone’s battery replaced once this year at $29, the phone must explicitly fail the diagnostic test to qualify for any additional battery replacements for $29. “If the test passes, a customer can still choose to have the battery replaced, but Apple’s standard $79 fee applies,” reads the article.
* As a quick refresher, iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80 percent of their original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.
* Devices that are eligible for the discounted battery service pricing include iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models.
* Apple previously said that the $29 fee is valid through December 31, 2018.
* As we previously reported, all Apple customers that request a battery replacement will get one, regardless of of the results of the battery diagnosis run on the device.
* Nearly 30 class action lawsuits have been filed so far over the iPhone throttling debacle.
