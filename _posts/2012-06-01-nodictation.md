* Do you rarely use dictation on your iPhone? Would you prefer if there was a way to completely get rid of the dictation button without totally getting rid of Siri? Well, if you’re jailbroken, now you can.
* Introducing: NoDictation — a simple jailbreak tweak that removes the dictation button on the iPhone keyboard once installed. The nice thing about NoDictation is that you can disable dictation on your iPhone, without having to totally disable Siri.
* Take a look at our video walkthrough of NoDictation for more information on how it operates…
* If you’re looking to disable dictation on the new iPad, you can install this tweak of course, but it would be more advisable to simply head to Settings > Keyboards and disabled the Dictation option.
* NoDictation is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you rarely find the need to use dictation on the iPhone, or you find yourself always accidentally invoking dictation, then I suggest you give it a look. What do you think?
