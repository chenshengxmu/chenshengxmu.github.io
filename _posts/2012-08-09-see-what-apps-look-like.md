* For months, rumors have been bouncing around that Apple was finally going to give its iPhone a larger display this fall. And these rumors have been all-but-confirmed by industry insiders and claimed leaked components.
* Then earlier this week, it was reaffirmed when it was discovered that iOS 6 is capable of running on such a display, at a resolution of 640 x 1136. And we’ve got some images of what apps will look like if the speculation holds true…

* 9to5Mac points to the screenshots, which were taken by iOS consultant Sonny Dickson. Sonny installed some applications into the new iOS 6 iPhone simulator, running at the aforementioned resolution, and as you can see, apps that have been updated to handle the new dimensions look great.
* But apps not updated, not so much. Sonny also tried installing apps from the iOS 5 simulator into the iOS 6 sim and the results are pretty terrible. They ran in pillar-boxed mode with black bars on the top and bottom of each app.

* Hopefully this isn’t indicative of the final product, as we’re guessing that not all 600,000+ apps in the App Store would be immediately updated to support a larger iPhone screen. And the whole pillar-boxed thing is so Android.
* But nevertheless, this does seem to further prove that Apple’s next handset will be sporting the often-rumored 4-inch display. Apple is widely expected to unveil the smartphone, among other new products, at a media event on September 12.
* So, what do you think?
