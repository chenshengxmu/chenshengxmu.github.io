* I’m loving my Apple TV and AirPlay, an Apple media technology which streams content from the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac devices to television sets through the company’s $99 set-top box.
* Unfortunately, AirPlay is a proprietary technology that only works with Apple hardware. Don’t you just wish the industry finally settled on a single cross-platform streaming media standard?
* That’s the issue a new application for Android devices is attempting to tackle. Created by CyanogenMod developer Koushik Dutta, the AllCast app lets you stream online (Dropbox, Google Drive and so forth) or locally-stored content to your Apple TV, Roku and a number of other set-top boxes and DLNA-compatible devices such as the PlayStation 3 console.
* Currently in beta, the software works surprisingly well and I’ve included a video to show it to you right after the break…
* It couldn’t be simpler: just choose a video stored locally on your Android device, tap the cast button in the upper right corner and choose your destination device.
* A few seconds later, the video will start streaming to a chosen device.
* As Engadget notes, there’s currently no support for Google’s $35 Chromecast HDMI dongle or YouTube. The app is compatible with popular online sources such as Google Drive and Dropbox and various media-stremaing devices including the Apple TV, Roku, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, Samsung Smart TV and DLNA renderers.
* For those unaware, DLNA content sharing is built into most Samsung devices and there are many DLNA-compatible players and devices out there.
* It doesn’t work with the PlayStation 4 because Sony has inexplicably removed DLNA support from its fourth-generation console. AllCast won’t mirror your device’s screen either, it just beams whatever content is currently playing to an output device, wirelessly.
* Here’s the video.
* According to Koushik’s post over at Google+, his pet project is currently in beta.
* You’ll need to join the ClockworkMod beta testers Google+ group, and then download the latest beta on Google Play. The app does not require your device to be rooted and is free of charge.
* A final release is due soon.
* This isn’t the first Android app to do AirPlay.
* Surprisingly enough, Apple’s never taken a tough stance against non-iOS apps which implement AirPlay, which is a tad weird considering AirPlay streaming as a proprietary technology is not open or even fully documented.
