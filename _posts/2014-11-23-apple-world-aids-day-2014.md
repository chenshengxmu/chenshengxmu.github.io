* Apple on Sunday night announced its RED campaign for World AIDS Day 2014. For the next two weeks, Apple is devoting a special section of the App Store called “Apps for (RED),” which will feature 25 apps with exclusive new content where all proceeds will go directly to the Global Fund to fight aids.
* Additionally, Apple says that it will donate a portion of all sales from both its retail and online stores around the world to the Global Fund from during Friday, November 28 and Monday, December 1. These days are known as ‘Black Friday’ and ‘Cyber Monday,’ and are two of the biggest shopping days of the year.
* “Apple is a proud supporter of (RED) because we believe the gift of life is the most important gift anyone can give,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “For eight years, our customers have been helping fight AIDS in Africa by funding life-saving treatments which are having a profoundly positive impact. This year we are launching our biggest fundraising push yet with the participation of Apple’s retail and online stores, and some of the brightest minds in the App Store are lending their talents to the effort as well.”
* Apple has long been a supporter of Product (RED), churning out special editions of everything from iPods to iPad Smart Covers. Last year, Jony Ive and Marc designed products for a (RED) benefit auction, and in April, RED revealed that Apple has contributed over $70 million to the cause since 2006.
* Here are the apps participating in the Apps for Red campaign:
* World Aids Day is observed on December 1 of every year, and is dedicated to raising awareness of AIDS, which is caused by the HIV infection. The day is typically observed by both Government and non-governmental organizations around the world, accompanied by education on AIDS prevention and control.
