* We just got a bit of clarification from the Chronic Dev Team who confirmed that GreenPois0n will only jailbreak the iPhone 4, iPad, and iPod Touch 4G. The news was later confirmed by MuscleNerd who made it clear that GreenPois0n will only work for iDevices boasting Apple’s A4 chip.
* As a reminder, GreenPoison is supposed to ship this Sunday. We’ll get those guides and tutorials published asap! In the meanwhile, stay tuned for more GreenPois0n news as it becomes available.
* Update: Comex is working on a jailbreak for iPhone 3GS
