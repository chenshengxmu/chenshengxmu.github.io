* At long last, Tapbots’ widely expected update to Tweetbot, its popular mobile Twitter client, has gracefully landed on the App Store. Twitter 3 for iPhone, which was last updated in July 2015, and Twitter for iPad, an outdated app that saw its last refresh back in June 2014, are no longer available for download in the App Store. Replacing them is Tweetbot 4, a universal app supporting any iPhone, iPod touch and iPad with iOS 9.0 or later.
* Tweetbot 4 packs a bevy of new features like Quick Reply from notification banners, landscape support, revamped profile views, split-screen multitasking on iPads, Activity and Statistics analysis and much more.
* Tweetbot 4 is a $4.99 download for both new and existing customers.
* The user interface has been cleaned up and streamlined for unified appearance across your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad device. In addition to landscape support on all form-factor iOS devices and being a universal binary, the new Tweetbot introduces all-new Statistics and Activity views.

* These new modes were designed to give you a better idea of how trending your tweets are and how many new followers you get each day. And if you’re on Wi-Fi and not cellular, you can even watch your tweets get faved, retweeted, mentioned and quoted in real time, as well as see your daily global activity graph grow over the last 7 days.
* Turn your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad upside down and Tweetbot 4 enters a nicely designed column view, which puts your list, search result, mentions, statistics or activity stream in a single column.
* Other parts of the app have been rethought, redesigned and moved around, too. For instance, mute filters now provide more granular settings and you can now reply to direct mentions and other Twitter notifications by pulling down on Tweetbot’s notification banner to reveal the text input field (similar to Quick Reply for Messages).

* User profiles and status details have been redesigned and, yes—Tweetbot supports iOS 9’s new Split View multitasking mode on the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4.
* Oh, and the app bakes in full support for external keyboard shortcuts in Tweetbot 4 for iPad, allowing you to bring up an overlay listing all of the available shortcuts based on the view you’re in.

* Tweetbot 4 requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 9.0 or later. The app is English-only so non-US customers may need to change their regional preference in Settings to United States.
* Tweetbot 4 is $4.99 in the App Store, a fifty percent launch discount valid for a limited time. Again, there is no free upgrade path for existing customers.
