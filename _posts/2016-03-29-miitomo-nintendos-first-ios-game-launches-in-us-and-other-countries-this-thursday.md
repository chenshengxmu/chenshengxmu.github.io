* Following its soft-launch in Japan, Nintendo’s first mobile game for iOS and Android, Miitomo, will be hitting the United States and other countries this coming Thursday, March 31, the Japanese gaming giant announced in a media release issued this morning. A free-to-start social experience, Miitomo lets users spark one-of-a-kind conversations with friends in a whole new way using Mii characters, which first appeared on Nintendo’s original Wii console.
* The game was downloaded more than one million times in its first three days of availability in Japan, becoming the top free app on the Japanese App Store.
* The Miitomo app lets you customize Mii avatars by mixing and matching from costumes and styles to make it your own. You can even use your iPhone’s built-in camera to snap a selfie that Miitomo will convert into Mii form. Existing Miis can be imported from the Wii U or Nintendo 3DS systems using QR Code scanning, too.
* To preregister for Miitomo, sign up for a Nintendo Account before March 31 to receive an email when the app is ready to download and get free Platinum Points for the new My Nintendo rewards program, which will simultaneously launch with Miitomo.
* “Platinum Points can be earned by interacting with Nintendo apps and services, including Miitomo,” notes the company. “Gold Points are earned when purchasing digital versions of games from Nintendo.com or Nintendo eShop on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. Both Platinum and Gold Points can be redeemed for rewards like games, download content, in-app items and eShop discount coupons.”

* In addition, Nintendo is also launching an enhanced Wii U and Nintendo 3DS shop on Nintendo.com on the 31th for users with a Nintendo Account to purchase digital games.
* More than 2,000 games will be available on the upcoming digital store at launch, with all purchases being sent directly to users’ Nintendo 3DS or Wii U systems for download.
* Gamers will be able to find and purchase new, popular and discounted games, use filters to search by genre and more. Purchases of games from this website, as well as Nintendo eShop, will earn My Nintendo Gold Points.
* More than 200 million Mii characters currently exist across Nintendo systems.
