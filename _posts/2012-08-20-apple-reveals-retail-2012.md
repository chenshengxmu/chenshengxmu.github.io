* Apple has effectively broken the mold for retail chains with its successful line of Apple Stores. Located on expensive prime real estate, and designed inside and out to be completely unique, nothing about Apple’s stores are average.
* That includes performance as well. A report earlier this year found that Apple’s retail stores made roughly 17 times more than the average retailer — including jewelry stores. And today we find out some more interesting stats…
* The Cupertino company opened its 374th and 375th worldwide retail store in Canada this weekend, and The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple was able to score some info:
* “According to Apple, the company has seen almost 300 million worldwide visitors so far in 2012. To give you some type of comparison, by July 2011, the population of the United States was estimated to be 311 million people.
* There is also an interesting data point from Apple’s retail Genius Bar. According to the company, 50,000 people get serviced at a Genius Bar around the world, every single day.”
* These impressive numbers come in wake of a recent misstep involving Apple’s new retail head John Browett. A few weeks ago, Browett tried to institute a new ‘staffing formula’ that saw a number of layoffs and shift cuts.
* But as soon as the plan made headlines, it was reversed. In a communication with store leadership teams, Browett admitted that the idea was a mistake and reiterated that Apple’s retail staff was of utmost importance.
* And for good reason. Analysts are expecting Apple Store visitor numbers to multiply this fall as the company unveils a slew of new products including a new smartphone, a new tablet, and a revamped line of iPod products.
