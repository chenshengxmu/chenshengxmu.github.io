* This must be ‘unveil your latest product’ week for accessory makers. Logitech took the wraps off its new Ultrathin Keyboard for the iPad mini yesterday, Griffin just announced new designer iPhone 5 cases, and now Mophie has come forward.
* The California-based designer and manufacturer introduced the iPhone 5 version of its popular battery case line today, the Juice Pack Helium. The case is 13% thinner than any previous Juice Pack, and features a built-in 1500mAh battery…
* From the Helium’s product description (via MacRumors):
* “Engineered with edge-to-edge protection and outfitted with 80% more battery life to keep your iPhone 5 safe and charged, the juice pack helium allows you to truly Do more™. Its elegant, thin design makes it the perfect accessory, easily fitting into any pocket or handbag. The enhanced forward-ported acoustics redirects the iPhone audio towards you, optimizing playback and maximizing your experience.”
* The case’s dimensions come in at 2.49 in x 5.49 in x 0.59 in, and its 1500 mAh battery can increase your iPhone 5’s battery life by 80%— which Mophie says is good for an additional 6 hours of LTE use. And it’s rechargeable via a micro-USB cable.
* I have to say, I’ve been pretty happy with my iPhone 5’s battery life. So I don’t really have a need for a battery case. But I guess if you do, the Helium seems like a great option. If you want to check it out, it’s available on Mophie’s website for just $79.99.
