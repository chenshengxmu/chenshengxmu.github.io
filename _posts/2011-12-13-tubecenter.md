* TubeCenter — as its name might allude to — is a tweak that allows you to place a YouTube widget in iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* The only problem with this tweak, is that it lacked any keyboard support — at least it did during my initial testing.
* Once it’s updated with the proper keyboard support, fans of YouTube could find this tweak useful. Check out our synopsis inside…
* At the end of the day, TubeCenter is pretty much worthless in its current state. You can’t login, you can’t search; the only thing you can do is watch what comes up as default, which as you can see isn’t always the best of content.
* If you try TubeCenter, let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
