* Those of you who own an iPhone 3G or an iPod Touch 2G (non-MC model) can jailbreak/unlock iOS 4.0.2. To jailbreak your iPhone 3G 4.0.2, you will have to use RedSn0w 0.9.5b5-5.

* Step 1: Make sure you have the latest version of iTunes installed (iTunes 9.2).
* Step 2: Download iOS 4 (not iOS 4.0.2) for iPhone 3G to your desktop from our iPhone downloads section.
* Step 3: Update your iPhone to iOS 4.0.2 via iTunes.
* Step 4: Download the latest version of RedSn0w from here.
* Step 5: Point RedSn0w to the iOS 4 (not 4.0.2) you downloaded in step 2.
* Step 6: Select “Install Cydia”.
* Step 7: Follow the onscreen instructions.
* Step 8: Let RedSn0w do the hard work for you. Once jailbroken, your iPhone will reboot.
* Since iOS 4.0.2 didn’t update the iPhone baseband, you can still use UltraSn0w to unlock your iPhone.
* Step 1: Jailbreak your iPhone using the method described above.
* Step 2: Go to Cydia and search for UltraSn0w. If it’s not there, you might have to add the following repo: repo666.ultrasn0w.com
* Step 3: Install UltraSn0w.
* Step 4: Reboot your iPhone.
