* I’ve always liked how Apple each holiday season changes its homepage to feature some nice holiday-themed graphics and ads. This year is no different: after airing an excellent new iPhone 5s ‘Misunderstood’ ad this past weekend, Apple has now refreshed its homepage with said video, as well as some nice teaser graphics.
* The graphics includes links to the commercial itself as well as the home video in its entirety, which Apple says was shot on the iPhone 5s.
* Go visit Apple.com now and get your handkerchiefs ready!
* The generally well-received commercial is one of the best Apple’s ever made, at least in my personal opinion. The story-telling concept is focused on a teenage boy who surprises his family with a thoughtful holiday gift.
* Check it out below.

* And here’s the full-length Harris family home movie from Apple’s 2013 holiday ad, shot entirely on the iPhone 5s.

* It’s interesting that Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller have tweeted out the YouTube ad yesterday.
* Happy Holidays to all of our amazing customers! http://t.co/eonnck8cDF

* Yes, the footage for the kid’s video was indeed shot using the iPhone 5s, with a caveat: as pointed out by Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, the kid is always shown holding the iPhone in portrait even though the video is comprised entirely of footage shot in landscape.
* “I say forgive this slight cheat, let’s not niggle — it helps sell the twist, and it’s a damn good twist,” Gruber noted.
* The iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c rank high in both Google and Yahoo searches in 2013, by the way.
