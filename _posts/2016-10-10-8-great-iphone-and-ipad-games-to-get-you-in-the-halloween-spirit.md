* It’s October, and that means Halloween is just around the corner!
* Keeping everyone in the spooky spirit of Halloween, we’ve got a list of fun and thrilling games you can download from the App Store and play on your iPhone or iPad to prepare yourself for the onslaught of zombies and monsters that are sure to be ringing your doorbell this year.
* Zombie Highway 2

* It’s hard to go through a Halloween season without playing Zombie Highway 2, a personal favorite of mine.
* It’ll have you driving a car through the middle of a zombie apocalypse with tilt controls, all while trying to kill off all the zombies that will try to attach themselves to your speeding vehicle. You can slam them up against obstacles, or you can shoot at them with high-powered guns and weapons from inside your car.
* As you advance, the zombies become stronger and more whacks or shots are required to get them off of your car. You need to act quickly, or else they’ll topple your car over at highway speeds and then eat your brains.
* You can pick up Zombie Highway 2 from the App Store for free.
* Stupid Zombies 3

* Anyone who enjoys themselves some physics or geometry will love this game.
* In Stupid Zombies 3, you will shoot at zombies and the bullets will bounce off of walls and travel in straight lines. They’ll come back around to take out more zombies after they hit a wall, but you have to line them up just right to tackle as many zombies as possible within the allotted ammunition that you’re given.
* Moreover, you can also shoot at things that can explode, such as gas cans, and these will do more damage to the zombies around them in the hard to reach places.
* This game can be a mind bender, but it’s absolutely fun to play. You can download Stupid Zombies 3 from the App Store for free.
* Slender Rising

* Halloween isn’t spooky without the thrill factor, and Slender Man is one of the highest adrenaline-pumping games we’re aware of.
* In Slender Rising, which is a pretty good remake of the popular Slender Man PC game, you look around a map for notes and collect them. As you collect more of them, Slender Man finds it easier to find you. You need to look away from him and get away, or he will drive you insane.
* The goal is to find all of the notes without going insane, and trust us, it gets really hard as you collect more notes. Remember not to look at Slender Man for too long!
* You can download Slender Rising from the App Store for $2.99.
* Minigore 2: Zombies

* Minigore 2: Zombies is another personal favorite of mine where you are being attacked by an onslaught of mini monsters.
* Your goal is to take out as many as possible and to stay alive as long as possible. You’re given a weapon and can constantly switch out for new weapons as they become available throughout the game.
* By shooting down your foes, you collect gold and a potential new high score. If you get bitten by too many monsters, your health eventually drops until the point where you’re considered dead, and at that point, it’s game over.
* You can download Minigore 2 from the App Store for $1.99.
* Plants vs. Zombies 2

* This one’s a classic, and I think I’d be hard pressed to find anyone reading this article that’s never heard of the Plants vs. Zombies series.
* In this game, you’re essentially trying to create a wall of plants that can take out an army of zombies who are trying to make their way into your house. The plants are going to shoot seeds at, explode on, or create a barrier between you and the zombies.
* Once you make it through a wave of zombies without letting any of them into your house, you will move on to the next level. As you advance, you unlock new plants, as well as new zombies, both of which have new abilities.
* You can download Plants vs. Zombies 2 for free from the App Store.
* Cabin Escape: Alice’s Story

* Moving away from zombies and monsters for a minute, Cabin Escape: Alice’s Story is another great game that’s sure to test your mental capacity.
* In this game, you are tasked with trying to escape from a cabin that you’ve been locked inside of. The only way out is to use the clues you’re given to solve the various puzzles scattered throughout.
* If you’re into these mind-bending games, this is a highly-rated one that will definitely help you through your day when you get bored.
* You can download Cabin Escape: Alice’s Story for free from the App Store.

* Whenever I talk about zombie games, it’s hard not to mention one of my personal favorites: Zombieville USA 2.
* In this game, you’re essentially trying to survive a zombie apocalypse by shooting down zombies and looting them to earn rewards. You can also loot mailboxes, trashcans, and more as you look for more cash to unlock bigger and better guns.
* The goal is to make it to the end where your comrades are waiting for you, typically by helicopter. You want to make it there before dying so you can get to the next level.
* You can download Zombieville USA 2 from the App Store for just $0.99.
* Zombie Gunship: Gun Down Zombies

* Zombie Gunship: Gun Down Zombies is another fun one for the preparers out there who want to gun down all of the zombies who threaten human life as we know it.
* In this game, you are working from the skies to exterminate the brain-hungry monsters. Using infrared vision, you’re going to be carefully targeting them to provide support for your ground troops and remaining survivors.
