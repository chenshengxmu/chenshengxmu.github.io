* Apple’s online store has come back up, offering new details regarding the Apple Watch and its various pricing tiers. We found out during this morning’s event that the 18K gold Edition model will begin at $10,000, but we thought it’d be interesting to see how expensive the line goes, so we’ve put together a roundup of all 8 Edition models.
* 38mm 18-Karat Rose Gold Case with White Sport Band – $10,000

* So for now, the most expensive Apple Watch you’ll be able to order on day one will cost you $17,000. There have been rumors, though, that Apple is working on a gold version of its Link Bracelet, which would substantially increase the price, and we’re guessing we’ll see pricier options when third party luxury brands join the fray.
* Again, the Apple Watch will be available for pre-order on April 10, and begin shipping April 24. Edition models will be available in limited quantities, from select Apple Stores.
