* At least one critic is satisfied by Apple’s efforts to slow a growing number of iPhone crimes. San Francisco’s District Attorney, who earlier called on the iPhone maker to install a so-called kill switch in its handsets, now believes a feature in the company’s upcoming iOS 7 shows “clear improvements” by the tech giant.
* San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón made the comment Friday after testing Apple’s Activation Lock feature alongside the Absolute Software’s Lojack running on Samsung’s Galaxy S4…
* “I’m very optimistic that they came and were willing to share their technology with us,” Gascón told the San Francisco Examiner.
* The Activation Lock feature is part of iOS 7, expected to be released in September. Unveiled in June, Activation Lock prevents a stolen iPhone from being activated unless the thief knows the owner’s AppleID.
* Last week, Gascón gathered security experts to test the features included in both the Apple and Samsung handsets. At the time, the DA said the experts would “see if [the features] stand up to the tactics commonly employed by thieves.”
* In June, both the San Francisco law enforcement official and New York City Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced Save Our Smartphones (S.O.S.), an initiative aimed at protecting smartphone owners from a growing trend of theft, especially iPhones.

* Around one in three thefts involve smartphones, according to the FCC.
* While impressed with Apple’s efforts, the two men said they will not drop the topic until they get a response from Android maker Google and Windows Phone creator Microsoft. Both company have yet supplied anti-theft measures for tests, according to the report.
* Along with the Activation Lock feature in iOS 7, Apple reportedly is expected to include a fingerprint sensor in its iPhone 5S, a handset many believe is up for introduction this Fall.
* As smartphones become as commonplace as wallets and other everyday accessories, security must be a key feature for handset designers. Building in virtual kill-switches in phone software, as well as hardware which ties ownership to biometrics, should be seen as important first steps.
