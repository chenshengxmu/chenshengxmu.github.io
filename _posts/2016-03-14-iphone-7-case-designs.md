* Leaked third-party cases based on various iPhone 7 rumors have seemingly corroborated the notion that the device will have stereo speakers, a thinner Lightning port, dual cameras on the back and more.
* Claimed device schematics, published by French blog NowhereElse.fr, appear to confirm that the iPhone 7 has a nearly flush camera and no antenna seams on the back.
* CAD renderings, reportedly leaked from Taiwan-based Apple supplier Catcher Technology, depict what is most likely the upcoming iPhone 7.
* While the handset design resembles a refined iPhone 6/6s look and feel, there are no horizontal antenna bands on the back, except for a thinner line at the device’s sides at the bottom. In addition, a much larger camera cutout on the back suggests the rear camera lens will be almost flush with the housing.
* The design results in a “slight bulging outgrowth” versus today’s protruding lens in the iPhone 6/6s series, observes NowhereElse.fr. The 3.5mm headphone jack hole is notably absent from design schematics.
* The source of the leak claims that the iPhone 7 will be slightly thinner than that of the current-generation iPhone 6s.
* Apple is holding a media event on March 21, the day before its court showdown with the FBI. We’re expecting to see not only a new four-inch iPhone SE model introduced at the event, but also a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro and some new Apple Watch bands.
