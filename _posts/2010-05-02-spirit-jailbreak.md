title: Spirit Jailbreak Released
---
* Spirit, the userland jailbreak for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad is finally available. Weâ€™ve been waiting for Spirit for quite a while now. It was supposed to be released last Friday but Comex, its developer, decided to wait a few more days to make sure new iPad 3G owners would have time save their SHSH blobs, but also to finish up Spirit and make sure it was 100% reliable.
* For the occasion, Comex developed a new website for Spirit at SpiritJB dot com where you can download the Windows and Mac version. Note that at the time I am writing this, my antivirus keeps flagging Spirit as a trojan. Besides, the site is very slow due to an overwhelming amount of traffic.
* UPDATE: I turned off my antivirus and downloaded Spirit. It is 100% safe.
* Comex did a great job on that one. Congrats!
* UPDATE 2: I wrote a Spirit jailbreak tutorial for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.
