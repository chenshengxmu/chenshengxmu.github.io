* After adding a widget to its check-in app called Swarm back in December, Foursquare’s main iPhone application today finally received a brand new Today widget for iOS 8’s Notification Center of its own.
* Moreover, the latest 8.7 update added personalized recommendations while logged out, so you don’t need to even have an account with Foursquare to receive tips and recommendations about nearby places.
* Just open the app to get started.
* Upon updating your copy of Foursquare, pull down on any Home screen to bring up the Notification Center. In the Today section, tap on Edit at the bottom and hit the plus sign next to Foursquare in order to enable the widget.
* As seen top of post, the widget presents you with handy shortcuts for accessing Foursquare’s search function or finding places nearby to eat, drink and more. Tapping an icon in the Today widget takes you to a corresponding section inside the Foursquare app.
* “We also made some bug fixes and a bunch of small improvements to the iPad apps,” Foursquare writes in release notes.
* Lastly, “While Using the App” is available as an option in Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Foursquare. You’re wholeheartedly recommended to enable this option to minimize the impact of Foursquare’s location-tracking on your iPhone’s battery.
* The app received a native iPad interface in December and gained support for iOS 8’s Interactive Notifications so you can save, like and follow directly from the Lock screen. It supports the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen resolutions, integrates with 1Password and more.
* Back in August 2014, Foursquare received Yelp-like features and renewed its focus on location discovery by moving other non-essential features such as check-ins to the new Swarm app.
* The 8.7-megabyte universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. Widget functionality requires iOS 8.0 or newer.
* Foursquare is available free in the App Store.
