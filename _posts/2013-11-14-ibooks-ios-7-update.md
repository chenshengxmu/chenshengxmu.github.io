* Apple by now has updated much of its own iPhone and iPad applications that area available on the App Store, with the two major holdouts: iBooks and iTunes U (also pending in the update queue: Find My Friends and Keynote Remote, a Keynote presentation software companion).
* Now, Jony Ive’s been feeling your pain so today Apple issued a pair of long-expected updates bringing iBooks and iTunes U in line with the general iOS look and feel.
* The revamped iBooks “has been updated with a beautiful new design for iOS 7,” says Apple. The refresh includes a completely revamped iBook Store.
* Did they kill the page curl? Read on for the full breakdown…
* Rumors were true: this is the new iBooks app icon.

* As the screenies top of post and below clearly show, the bookshelf is gone so this new iBooks now resembles Apple’s bundled Newsstand application, for better or worse.

* In case you were wondering about that iconic page curl, a feature Steve Jobs himself conceived, Apple fortunately hasn’t pulled it from the new iBooks.
* As for iTunes U, there’s a corresponding flattened icon.

* “This version of iTunes U has been updated for iOS 7 with an all-new look and feel,” release notes read. Apart from iOS 7 aesthetics, there don’t seem to be other changes in iTunes U version 1.4.

* Do you like the new iOS 7-friendly design in iBooks and iTunes U?
* I know design is a matter of personal preference – and I’m all for Jony Ive’s minimalist approach that gets rid of all the clutter in favor of white space – but I would very much love to see the new iOS 7 keyboard in these apps.
* Also completely iOS 7-ified recently: Remote, AirPort Utility, Trailers, Podcast, Find My Friends, iWork and iLife suites and other Apple apps.
* Can you now please replace that faux stitched leather in Find My Friends with something, you know, flat?
* Download iBooks free from the App Store.
* iTunes U is also available free of charge in the App Store.
