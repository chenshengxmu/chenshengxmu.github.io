* Browser Changer is a new applications available in Cydia that lets you make a third-party browser your default browser. This way, you can open links in a third-party browser instead of opening them in Safari.

* Why would use this application? Let me explain. Let’s say your web browser of choice is Opera Mini. Every time you click on a link in an email for example, you may want this link to open in Opera Mini. Apple doesn’t let you do this but Browser Changer will.
* This is definitely not a ground breaking application, but it is still a nice tweak for those of you who use a browser different from Safari. This app also comes with a SBSettings toggle, so you can turn it on/off easily and quickly.
* Browser Changer offers support for Atomic, iCab Mobile, Perfect Browser and Opera Mini. You can simply choose your default browser in the settings.app.
* You can get Browser Changer for free from Cydia. If you decide to try it on, please leave a comment below to tell us what you think about this app.
* Thanks @PhoneTrips for the tip!
