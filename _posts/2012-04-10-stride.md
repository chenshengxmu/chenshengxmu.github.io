* Stride is a brand new jailbreak tweak from excellent jailbreak developer and designer Adam Bell. It allows you to unlock your iPhone using an 8-bit styled drawing for security, in lieu of iOS’ boring passcode option.
* When you try out the tweak for yourself, it’s immediately obvious that there’s some highly calculated design behind this effort. Indeed, Stride allows you to unlock your iPhone with impeccable style…
* Stride features a simple and straight to the point preference panel, which will have you up and running in no time.
* The options allow you to enable or disable Stride, Skip PIN entry, and change your password. Tapping the change password button will bring up an 8-bit styled grid that prompts you to use your finger to draw a simple pattern. Once this pattern is confirmed, it will be your new password.
* On the Lock screen you will now be presented with a “Draw Password” option instead of the more familiar “Enter Passcode”. Drawing the password correct will unlock your device, assuming you have the Skip PIN entry option enabled.
* The nice thing about Stride is that it doesn’t omit, or break Apple’s fairly secure passcode system. The passcode is always available to fall back on in case you forget how to draw your password. If you’re feeling cautious, you can still force the passcode option by disabling Skip PIN entry in the settings.
* Stride is a beautiful jailbreak tweak that reeks of style, but said style comes at a premium. At $2.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, it’s not exactly a knee-jerk purchase.
* But if you’re tired of seeing the same old repetitive tweaks that serve no purpose, you need to support this effort. It’s obvious that Adam spent some serious time creating Stride, and he should be rewarded for his ambitions.
* Stride is absolutely worth considering if you wish to bless your Lock screen with a breath of fresh air.
* What do you think?
