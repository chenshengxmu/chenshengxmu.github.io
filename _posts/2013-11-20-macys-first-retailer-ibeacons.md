* Following reports that Apple is working to implement iBeacon tech in its retail stores comes word that Shopkick has beat it to the punch. The shopping app has teamed up with Macy’s to deliver the first major retail iBeacon system.
* The technology, which is new to iOS 7, uses Bluetooth LE signaling to enable micro-location services and is expected to be a huge hit with retailers. The tech will allow stores to deliver targeted sales and information to their customers…
* From Shopkick’s announcement:
* “Shopkick deployed the first iBeacon/BLE-based presence signal at any major retailer on November 20, 2013. It is called shopBeacon and is currently live in a closed beta trial at Macy’s Herald Square, New York and Union Square, San Francisco. ShopBeacon can welcome a shopper when she enters a store and show her location-specific deals, discounts, recommendations, and rewards, without her having to remember to open the app.”
* The shopBeacon service can also tie in at-home browsing history. So say for example, a customer “likes” a specific product within a retailer’s app. When that customer enters the store, the service can inform them if it’s available or on sale.
* Shopkick notes that shopBeacon hardware requires minimal investment, can be installed by sticking the device on a wall or other flat surface, and has a battery life of five years. Retailers like Old Navy and Best Buy have already signed on.
* The update for the Shopkick app and Macy’s new shopBeacon technology are set to go live in a few weeks. And we’re also expecting to see iBeacon tech implemented at Apple’s retail stores and at Major League Baseball parks next season.
