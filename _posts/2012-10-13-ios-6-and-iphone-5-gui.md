* Heads up all of you designers and concept artists. The entire GUI (graphical user interface) for iOS 6 has just been uploaded to the web.
* That’s right, all of the buttons, menus, icons and anything else you can think of graphic-wise in iOS are now available for download…
* The images come from the folks over at Teehan+Lax, a design firm known for its iOS GUI work, in the form of a 14MB Photoshop file.
* It’s iPhone 5-compatible, so everything has been scaled to fit its larger 4-inch display. And the best part is it’s completely free and available to the general public, meaning you don’t have to be an iOS developer to download it.
* Just keep these licensing terms in mind:
* “The sole purpose of this file is to help you pitch, design and build amazing software. It can’t be repurposed as your own, nor can it be broken apart and used to create similar tools.”
* If you’re interested in the iOS 6 GUI PSD, you can download it by clicking here. The site also has iOS 5, iPad, and iPhone 4 GUI PSDs available.
