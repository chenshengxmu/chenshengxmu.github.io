* You know how they say that sometimes more is less. Some also say that specs don’t really matter anymore. Well, it all comes true in a camera shootout carried out by the folks at Laptop Mag between the Nokia Lumia 1020, and the iPhone 5s. For those who are still keeping track of specs out there, let’s note that the Lumia 1020 comes with a whopping 41MP camera. Apparently that wasn’t enough to beat the iPhone 5s 8MP camera though…
* The iPhone 5s conclusively beat the Nokia Lumia 1020 in our photo face-off, taking seven out of 10 rounds–and tying one. Even after updating the Lumia 1020′s camera software, which reduced issues with the blue color cast on many images, colors were still more accurate on the iPhone. Apple’s device also excelled when delivering detail and contrast.
