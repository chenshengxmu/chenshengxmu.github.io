* It was a silly story to begin with, but it appears that Apple has changed the answer that Siri responds with when you inquire about the “best smartphone ever”.
* Previously, Siri referred you to a Wolfram Alpha result where none other than the Nokia Lumia 900 — a direct iPhone 4S competitor — claimed the top spot.
* Needless to say, Apple has now put an end to those shenanigans…
* It’s good to see that Apple has a nice sense of humor about all of this. It’s also nice to see that they updated Siri with more, ahem, accurate responses.
* What do you think?
