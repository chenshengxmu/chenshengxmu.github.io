* Apple on Wednesday seeded the fourth beta for iOS 9.3.3 to both developers and public testers. The beta can be installed via the over-the-air update mechanism in iOS, or it can be downloaded from either Apple’s dev center or the Beta Software Program website.
* The update comes just one week after the third iOS 9.3.3 beta was released, suggesting that it may soon be ready for public launch. Don’t get too excited though. It’s mostly bug fixes, as Apple tries to tie up a few loose ends and turn its full attention to iOS 10.
* In addition to iOS, Apple also seeded new betas for tvOS and OS X on Tuesday. The betas are available to registered developers and testers, and can be installed via OTA in tvOS, for those with the latest beta profile, and the Update tab in the Mac App Store.
* OS X 10.11.6 and tvOS 9.2.2 are also minor updates, featuring mostly bug fixes and improvements. Again it seems like Apple is just looking to tighten things up as it moves on to the next versions. macOS Sierra and tvOS 10 are expected to land later this year.
