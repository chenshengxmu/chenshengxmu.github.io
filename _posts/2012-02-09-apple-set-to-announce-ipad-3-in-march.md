* We’re undoubtedly nearing the announcement of whatever Apple has up its sleeve for the next generation iPad, and now new claims suggest we’re just a few short weeks away from the big day.
* John Paczkowski of AllThingsD now believes that Apple will hold a press event first week in March, with the iPad 3/iPad 2S/iPad Super Epic Edition being made available for purchase soon after. If the iPad 2 release is any kind of indicator, we wouldn’t expect to have to wait any longer than two weeks from the announcement before queuing up to buy one.
* As is always the case, Apple refused to comment on the speculation, though it is an open secret that the next generation iPad is very much on the horizon…
* Paczkowski also claims that the iPad 3 will sport much the same level of specification as we have come to expect following the numerous rumors and counter-rumors that have been circulating on the internet of late. A new, faster CPU and a high-res Retina Display are on the cards, along with a similar form factor to the one we have grown to love since the introduction of the iPad 2. The addition of that new screen may call for a slightly thicker body, however.
* The announcement is expected to take place in San Francisco, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, a venue that Apple has favored regularly in the past.
* It’s also worth noting that Paczkowski has been a source of accurate information such as this in the past. He was able to successfully predict several iPhone announcements as well as last year’s iPad 2 event. We see no reason why his radar would be too far off on this occasion.
* It doesn’t look like we have much longer to wait now, folks!
