* You’ll never get caught in the rain or snow again no matter where you live, provided you use Yahoo’s gorgeously designed mobile Weather app which in its most recent update has added near-term weather alerts.
* In addition, Yahoo Weather for iPhone and iPad, now bumped to version 1.8, is even more accurate than before and zooms in smartly on microclimates.
* Now Yahoo Weather users worldwide can take advantage of the new near-term rain and snow alerts. “You’ll never be stuck outside, unprepared again,” teases the team.
* As mentioned before, the app will alert you 15 minutes before rain or snow is expected, “so you can grab your jacket, rain boots or umbrella.”
* As demonstrated by the animated GIF below, these alerts take the form of native push notifications on your iPhone that appear on your Lock screen and within the Notification Center, unless chosen otherwise.
* You will need to turn on the new snow and rain alerts yourself.
* Open Yahoo Weather on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, tap the hamburger icon in the upper left corner and the options screen will slide into view. Choose Settings at the bottom and on the next screen flip the Near-Term Notifications switch to the ON position.

* And while you’re at it, you can customize your units and choose when daily notifications for weather conditions will be delivered in the morning and evening.
* In addition to near-term alerts for snow and rain, Yahoo Weather is now more accurate than before. “We took some major steps to overhaul the way we determine and serve forecasts,” the team noted. “The app will even zoom in on microclimates.”
