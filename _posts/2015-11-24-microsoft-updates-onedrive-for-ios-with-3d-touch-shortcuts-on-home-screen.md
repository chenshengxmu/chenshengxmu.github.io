* Windows maker Microsoft today updated its cloud-storage client for iOS, OneDrive, with a trio of new features.
* For starters, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus owners can now quickly access their most recently used files by pressing OneDrive’s Home screen icon lightly to bring up a menu providing direct access to their recent files.
* Additionally, scoped folder search for personal OneDrive accounts is now back by popular demand and business users will appreciate support for Microsoft’s Intone mobile app management service.
* This edition of OneDrive includes the following items:
* This app has been seeing meaningful feature additions and valuable improvements on a regular basis as Microsoft continues to position its cloud-storage service as a companion to its mobile Office apps.
* In September 2015, the app gained several new PDF-focused features to make it easy for users to annotate and sign PDF documents and share OneDrive files as email attachments directly through Outlook, if it’s installed.

* Microsoft recently previewed its new OneDrive for Business sync client for organizations, introduced other updates to business customers, rolled out expanded OneDrive for Business support to developers and gave OneDrive’s web interface a major facelift.
