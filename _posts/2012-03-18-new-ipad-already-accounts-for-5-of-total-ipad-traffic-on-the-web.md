* According to some analysts, Apple is on track to sell its 100 millionth iPad this year. It recently came off an explosive quarter, selling 15 million units of the iPad 2 and iPad combined.
* Apple will most likely publish numbers in the coming days, giving us the full story on how the iPad did this weekend.
