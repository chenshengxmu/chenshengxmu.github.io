* The Newsstand glitch that we told you about a few days ago has opened up a whole can of worms for various other glitches. We posted earlier about the ability to create a respring shortcut by means of the glitch, and now we’ll show you how to hide any app on your Home screen using the same technique.
* The nice thing about this trick is that it doesn’t require any outside apps, websites, or anything else to work. In other words, it’s completely self contained on the iPhone. Take a look at our brief video walkthrough inside to see how it works.
* Step 1: Place any apps that you want to hide in the same folder and place that folder on the third page of the Home screen.
* Step 2: Place the Newsstand folder on the second page of the Home screen.
* Step 3: Use the Newsstand glitch, to place the folder containing the apps you want to hide into the Newsstand folder. Again, to do this you need to be on the third page, tap the Home button, and immediately tap and hold on the folder containing the apps that you want to hide. After the screen goes to the first page, immediately swipe to the second page containing the Newsstand folder. If you see your device go into wiggle mode automatically, then it worked. From here, tap the Newsstand folder, and then press the Home button. The folder containing the apps that you would like to hide should now appear in the Newsstand folder. Please see our Newsstand glitch post for more details.
* Step 4: Next, you may either reboot your device, or use the respring glitch to quickly respring your device. I recommend the respring glitch, because it’s much faster than waiting for your device to completely reboot.
* Step 5: Once your iPhone is back on the Home screen, check the Newsstand folder. The folder containing the apps should no longer be there. In fact, they won’t be found anywhere on the Home screen, as they are now completely hidden.
* Step 6: To recover your hidden apps, simply reboot your device, or run the respring glitch for a second time.
* Note: I only tested this on the iPhone 5, but it may work fine for other devices as well. Let me know what you find.
* Even though the apps are hidden, you can still easily launch the apps from the Spotlight search menu. Simply search for the app in question via your Spotlight menu, and tap to launch the app.
* It is possible to completely hide nearly every app on your Home screen if you go about this correctly. Obviously the Newsstand app will always remain, seeing as that is the means that you use to make the glitch work.
* For those of you familiar with jailbroken iPhones, this is a good temporary workaround until we get a jailbreak for the iPhone 5. One of my favorite jailbreak tweaks is called Poof, and it lets you selectively hide any app installed on the iPhone. Until the time comes for a real jailbreak for the iPhone 5, I suppose this is the next best thing.
* Have you tried any of the non-jailbreak tweaks that we’ve posted thus far? Do you plan on giving this one a try? Let me know what you think about it in the comments section below.
