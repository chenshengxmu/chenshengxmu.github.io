* Samsung’s co-CEO and mobile chief J.K. Shin is in the hot seat as the company posts its third straight quarter of operating-profit declines.
* It’s fascinating to watch how quickly things are turning for the conglomerate responsible for nearly one-fifth of South Korea’s Gross domestic product.
* Operating profits were down sharply, decreasing a whopping 25 percent year over year. More importantly, Samsung’s favorite business metric – the market share – is under pressure, too: its worldwide share of smartphones slipped to 25 percent in the second quarter from 32 percent a year earlier.
* This is bad news considering that 76 percent of the firm’s profit comes from smartphones. What gives?
* The Wall Street Journal on Thursday issued a damning outlook for Samsung and its mobile chief.
* As the second quarter accounted for 61 percent of Samsung’s total operating profits of about $7 billion, J.K. Shin, 58 years old, is feeling the heat as nervous analysts begin to think about the post-Shin era at the troubled company.
* Analysts have also been harsh in recent weeks. In a note to clients in early July, Daniel Kim at Macquarie Securities wrote that the company needs to “formulate a new mobile strategy from a zero base,” and added that such a move could be accompanied by a “change in top management in the mobile division”—a tactic the company has resorted to many times in the past.
* The recent smartphone struggles have reportedly forced “hundreds of senior managers” in Samsung’s mobile unit to take a 25 percent cut in their first-half bonuses. Samsung told WSJ that speculation about management changes is “groundless.”
* Some of Shin’s deadliest sins:
* Indeed, Samsung itself in a statement attributed the sales decline to its inventory management, China business and tablet sales, citing increasing competition from low-to-mid-end smartphone makers.
* WSJ profiles Shin as a successful executive who joined the company in 1984 and “emerged from relative obscurity” to make Samsung the #1 handset maker in the world. For this, he was rewarded with about $9.4 million in compensation in the first quarter alone.
* It’s interesting he didn’t attend a top university and instead graduated from Kwangwoon University in the suburbs of Seoul with a degree in electronics engineering.
* In 2011, he took charge of networks and cameras, in addition to mobile phones. By 2013, Shin was promoted to Samsung’s co-CEO.

* The executive is frequently attributed with key decisions such as adopting Android and the creation of the Galaxy S series which led to a multi-year legal spat with Apple over patent infringement.
* I’m imagining Samsung’s leaders emailing a link to the WSJ report to their subordinates, with the subject line saying “We have a lot of work to do to turn this around”.
* When/if Samsung collapses, it’s going to be bad. Its marketing budget has been valuable for many. And South Korea relies on Samsung.

* Following the January 2013 Wall Street Journal article entitled, “Has Apple Lost Its Cool to Samsung?” Schiller emailed Media Arts Lab, Apple’s long-time ad shop within TBWA, and told the agency the same thing, that “We have a lot of work to do to turn this around”.
* What a difference a year makes for Apple.
* To quote Jay Yarrow of Business Insider, the time may have come for Samsung to admit that Apple knows exactly what it’s doing with its iPhone business.
* Thoughts?
