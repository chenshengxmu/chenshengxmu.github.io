title: 28 Features We Want to See in the New iPhone
---
* A few weeks ago I wrote an article about some of the features the iPhone is still missing. Today Iâ€™d like to take this a bit further and come up with a comprehensive list of features we (you and I) want to see in the next iPhone.
* Here is my list (note that it is in no specific order). Please share in the comments what features you want in the next iPhone.
