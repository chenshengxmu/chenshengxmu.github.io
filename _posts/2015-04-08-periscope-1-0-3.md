* Twitter on Wednesday issued a second update to its live-broadcasting app on iOS, Periscope for iPhone. The new build brings an additional three new features along with a few enhancements and bug fixes making your experience more pleasing than before.
* In addition to easier blocking and major scrolling improvements, a new Follower Mode can be now turned on before starting a broadcast to limit comments to only viewers that you follow.
* You’ll also appreciate the new Global section where you’ll find live broadcasts from around the world, as opposed to your Home feed which contains live broadcasts and replays tailored to you.
* The app now distinguish between regular Twitter users and those who have been verified on the service by displaying the Twitter Verified badge on their profile pic.
* And if you want to stop someone from pestering you on Periscope, there’s now a much easier way to block them — just tap on their comment and choose the option to block.
* Periscope 1.0.2 changelog:
* An update last week focused on live broadcast improvements and improvements to in-app maps showing broadcaster’s location.
* The iPhone-only app requires iOS 7.1 or later. According to a post the development team published on its blog, Periscope for Android is due soon.
* “We’re working on it,” reads the article, without committing to specific dates.
* Download Periscope free in the App Store.
