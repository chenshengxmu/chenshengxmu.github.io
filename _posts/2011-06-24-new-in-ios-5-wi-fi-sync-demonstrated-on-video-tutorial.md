* Folks, are you excited? We surely are, because we just got our hands on iOS 5 beta 2, and we’ve been able to go hands on with Wi-Fi sync.
* Let me tell you, it works gloriously. I know this is sort of an overused mantra, especially in the Apple space, but it just works.
* Anyone who’s familiar with the jailbreak implementations of wireless syncing will be right at home with Apple’s iteration of Wi-Fi syncing, and unsurprisingly, it’s even simpler with Apple at the helm.
* Check inside for hands-on video coverage of iOS 5 beta 2’s Wi-Fi syncing capabilities…
* In order to get Wi-Fi sync working you must meet the following requirements: You must have iTunes 10.5 beta, iOS 5 beta 2, and a Wi-Fi Connection. You will also need a USB cable for the initial sync.
* After meeting those requirements, follow these steps to get Wi-Fi sync working:
* 1: Install iOS 5 beta 2 on your iOS device. 2: Install iTunes 10.5 beta on your computer. 3: Plug your device into your computer and open iTunes. 4: In iTunes under the summary tab for your device, enable “Sync over Wi-Fi connection” and sync your device via the usb connection. 5: Untether your device from USB, and your device will still be recognized by iTunes! 6: Drag and drop files from iTunes to your device, and wipe the tears from your eyes as you watch Wi-Fi sync work for the first time.
* What do you think about the new and improved Wi-Fi sync? Are you happy to finally be able to “cut the cord” so to speak?
