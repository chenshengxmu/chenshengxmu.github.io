title: Galaxy S III is cool, but official advert ignores marketing basics

* As you’ve no doubt heard by now, Samsung has challenged Apple’s smartphone dominance with yesterday’s introduction of the third-generation Galaxy S smartphone at the Unpacked event in London.
* Featuring an incremental bump up in specs and a host of software enhancements, you’d assume Samsung’s marketing folks would proudly show off the device in official advertising.
* Not so fast. A side-by-side comparison of the iPhone 4S and Galaxy S III commercials indicates Sammy’s got a whole lot of learning to do: their 60-second advert features the flagship handset three times less frequently than Apple’s commercial…
* As we reported yesterday (for the sake of discussion), the new Galaxy takes aim at the iPhone.
* Disregarding for a minute the growing similarities between Apple’s shiny adverts and Samsung’s over the top commercials, the new Galaxy gets little love as their 60-second ad features the actual product for ten seconds only.
* For comparison, Apple’s commercial proudly features the iPhone 4S for 27 seconds, nearly three times more often.
* And Apple’s is a 30-second ad, half the Samsung ad’s running time.
* As for the new Galaxy, reviewers seem to like it, with some opining it’ll give the iPhone a good run for its money – at least until Apple releases its sixth next-generation iPhone later this year.
* Taking a page from Apple’s book, the South Korean conglomerate gave the handset an incremental hardware refresh augmented with a slew of software-based enhancements.
* On the hardware front, the Galaxy S III features a 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos processor, a 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display sporting a 1280-by-720 pixel resolution, an eight-megapixel back camera and a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera.
* Software features are far more interesting.
* For example, the phone tracks your eyes to figure out when you want to use it and sports a pop-up player of sorts, allowing you to watch a movie while multitasking.
* It’s also got a Siri knock-off dubbed S-Voice (what’s with that purple tint, by the way), can recognize faces on the photos you take for automatic social sharing and has an Airplay-like feature that streams content to an HD TV set through the AllShare Cast Dongle, which is akin to the Apple TV set-top box.
* At press time, the Galaxy S III television commercial on Samsung Mobile’s YouTube channel was conspicuously set to private.
* If you’ve been wondering why all the fuss and can afford to spare an hour and fifteen minutes, the full Unpacked event video is now available online, included right below.
* Yes, Samsung’s ad is attempting to evoke emotions.
* But in my personal opinion, the company should consider hiring another advertising agency, because the advert ignores the basic rule – that folks like to see a product being advertised.
* In related news, Flipboard for Android just debuted on the Galaxy S III.
* Something tells me Phil Schiller won’t like this.
* Kudos to Cult of Mac‘s John Brownlee for bringing Guida iPhone‘s original discovery to attention.
* Looks like Samsung’s advertising department could make use of Apple’s marketing handbook to learn a thing or two about product promotion, no?
