* Smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home (and, soon, Apple’s alleged standalone Siri device) allow users to get answers in the more comfortable settings of their homes.
* As these things are always listening, there’s no need to press a button or pull a phone out of your pocket. But what exactly are people using Amazon Echo and other smart speakers for?
* A ComScore study, charted by Statista, says the most common use case is asking basic questions with 60 percent of US smart speaker owners using their device for simple requests, followed by weather queries (57 percent), playing music (54 percent), setting timers/alarms (41 percent), creating reminders/to-dos (39 percent) and more.
* In what’s bound to be disappointing to Amazon, the study found that very few users of smart speakers use them to order goods or services online, with just 8 percent of US smart speaker owners using their device to order food/services and 11 percent ordering products online.

* According to a May research conducted by digital agency Stone Temple, providing answers to basic questions actually is not Alexa’s strong suit.
* Amazon’s digital assistant powering the Echo family of devices was able to answer just 20.7 percent of the 5,000 questions asked as part of the experiment.
* Siri performed similar to Alexa.
* Amazon said today that Echo owners and iOS customers who use the mobile Alexa app or the Amazon shopping app can now enable integration with iCloud Calendar.
* Speaking of which, the comScore study found that less than one-third of smart speaker owners in the US (27 percent) use their device to find what’s on their calendar for the day or add new appointments to the calendar hands-free.
