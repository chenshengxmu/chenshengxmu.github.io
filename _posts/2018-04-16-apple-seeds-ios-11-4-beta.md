* Apple on Monday seeded the second betas of iOS 11.4, tvOS 11.4 and watchOS 4.3.1 to developers. Registered developers can download the new betas through Apple’s dev center, or they can be installed using each platform’s respective OTA updating mechanism.
* Today’s releases come two weeks after the first betas were made available, and here’s what we know so far: iOS 11.4 brings back support for AirPlay 2 and Messages in iCloud, tvOS 11.4 brings back AirPlay 2, and watchOS 4.3.1 warns that Apple may soon drop support for watchOS 1 apps.
* We are currently installing the new betas, and will be sure to report back if we find anything significant. And as always, if you see something notable we may have missed, feel free to tell us about it down in the comments section below.
