* Apple has filed for a pair of new figurative trademarks potentially indicating that many more health devices will be released in the future that will integrate seamlessly with Apple Watch.
* PatentlyApple reports that the new filings are based on Jamaica application numbers 072768 and 072769, which were filed on June 23, 2017. As you can see for yourself, one of the figurative trademarks depicts a runner in white and the lettering “Connect to Apple Watch” while the other shows a runner encircled in lime green while highlighting “Connects to Apple Watch.”

* The new Apple trademarks were filed under 3 international classes that cover computer software in the field of health, fitness, exercise and wellness; health, fitness, exercise and wellness sensors, monitors and displays, as well as medical apparatus and devices; and fitness and exercise machines and equipment, plus body-building apparatus.
* It’s unclear from the filings whether “Connect(s) to Apple Watch” may eventually extend to become Apple’s version of “Made for iOS” (MFi) licensing program for Apple Watch.
* That said, the trademarks could be used to communicate to buyers that a third-party accessory connects to and integrates with Apple Watch out of the box.
* Apple’s GymKit framework is the perfect example of how the “Connect to Apple Watch” logo might be used with GymKit-enabled cardio and fitness machines.
* Apple is also rumored to be working on a dedicated EKG reader in the form of an Apple Watch strap that detects abnormal heart rhythm and atrial fibrillation. That accessory would be a possible candidate for the “Connects with Apple Watch” marking.
