* According to a well-informed blog, in addition to the iPad mini and some new Macs, Apple today could also release a set of four new Lightning adapters and cables, two of which are aimed at providing compatibility with digital cameras via USB and SD cards, costing $29 each. The other two should provide a way to feed video from the device to external displays, projectors and other devices via the industry-standard VGA adapter or digital AV, priced at $49 each…
* Seth Weintraub of 9to5Mac provided the following list of the four incoming cables and prices.

* There will also be a new 60W MagSafe power adapter (a $79 value), likely for a rumored 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Retina display. Another adapter is Apple’s standard USB power adapter, priced at $19 and rated at 12W instead of 10W.
* That bump up in wattage could allow much faster charging and perhaps fix one of the most complained about features of the iPad 3rd generation: The long time it takes to charge.
* If that adapter is meant for the third-generation iPad, then Apple could easily launch a retooled iPad 3 thought to incorporate Lightning I/O as well as an improved display tech that consumes less energy.
* What do you make of this?
