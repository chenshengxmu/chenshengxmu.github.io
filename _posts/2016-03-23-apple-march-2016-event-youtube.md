* Apple held its ‘Let us loop you in’ media event on Monday to unveil the new four-inch iPhone SE, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Apple Watch bands and accessories and more. A replay of the live video broadcast has since been added to the Apple Special Events webpage and published as a downloadable podcasts on iTunes. And now, the entire presentation is available for streaming via Apple’s YouTube channel.
* The entire presentation runs one hour three minutes and thirty seconds long.
* I’ve embedded the YouTube clip below for your viewing pleasure.
* I like the intro animation, referring to April 1, 1976.
* This is the day Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne founded Apple. The company was actually incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. on January 3, 1977, and was later renamed as Apple Inc. at the original iPhone’s introduction on January 9, 2007.
* That means that come April 1, 2016, Apple will turn 40.
* How’s that for a milestone?
