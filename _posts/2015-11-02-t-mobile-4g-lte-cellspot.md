* Wireless carrier T-Mobile today introduced a new home device designed to provide a strong, reliable wireless 4G LTE signal for customers with or without an indoor cellular signal.
* Dubbed the LTE CellSpot, the device requires availability of T-Mobile’s wireless spectrum, but can also work in certain areas without cellular signal.
* The CellSpot is launching Wednesday, November 4, and will be provided at no charge to T-Mobile’s Simple Choice postpaid customers for as long as they’re with T-Mobile.
* “First we helped you personalize your Wi-Fi coverage, now we’re putting the power of 4G LTE coverage in your hands,” writes the carrier. A mini tower for your home or business, the CellSpot is intended for both personal and business use.
* Featuring low power settings for indoor use, the cell tower provides an average 3,000 square feet of full-bar T-Mobile LTE coverage throughout your home—or anywhere you need it—and supports T-Mobile’s advanced network features like Wi-Fi Calling, Voice over LTE (VoLTE), HD voice, advanced messaging, video calling and more.
* Key highlights include:
* The new device arrives just a week before T-Mobile holds its landmark 10th Un-carrier move in Los Angeles. The Deutsche Telekom-owned company claims to currently blanket approximately 300 million Americans by its LTE signal.
* The device will be available November 4 in participating stores nationwide or shipped through T-Mobile Customer Care.
* For more information, visit T-Mobile’s website.
* Will you be purchasing the LTE CellSpot, do you think? I must admit, the ability to light up T-Mobile’s LTE network wherever it’s needed most is an intriguing proposition.
