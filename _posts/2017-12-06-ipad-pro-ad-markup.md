* Apple earlier this week posted a new iPad Pro mini-ad on its official YouTube channel.
* Running just fifteen seconds long to make it instantly shareable on social media, the video focuses on the benefits of using Apple Pencil and iOS 11’s much improved Markup feature for easily annotating documents, screenshots, webpages and more.
* Song: “Go” by Louis The Child
* “With iPad Pro + iOS 11, you can use Apple Pencil to mark up anything in an instant, whether it’s a website, an email or your friend’s broken arm,” reads the video’s description.
* This mini-ad is based on Apple’s earlier “What’s a Computer?” commercial which showed off the versatility of iPad Pro as a computer replacement device.
* How do you like this new iPad Pro ad?
