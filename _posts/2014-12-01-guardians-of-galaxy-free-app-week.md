* Lost in the sea of Black Friday holiday deals and discounts on tons of Mac, iPhone and iPad apps and accessories, Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon is now available at no cost through Thursday, courtesy of Apple’s ongoing Free App of the Week promotion. That’s a savings of $4.99 for the iPhone and iPad download.
* In this action-role playing extravaganza, Marvel’s cosmic antiheroes face Roman, Nebula and other familiar foes.
* The game features cartoonish visuals, familiar characters like Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, Gamora and Drax, in addition to piles of unlockable ones such as Beta Ray Bill, a story co-written by comic-book scribe Dan Abnett and much more.
* I know what you’re thinking so I’m happy to report that there are no In-App Purchases in this game and no Internet connection is required to play.
* Highlights:
* The most recent update has brought out new playable characters (Iron Man, Quasar and Vance Astro), a new Collections system, a Regroup Powerup feature and more.
* The game should appeal to the fans of the genre and anyone interested in Marvel’s hero games. Release back in July, this marks the first time it’s gone free.
* The 77.7-megabyte download is compatible with the iPad, iPod touch and any iPhone from the iPhone 4s onward. iOS 7.0 or later is required.
* Grab Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon at no cost until Thursday, December 4.
