* Continuing on with its rundown of OS X 10.10 Yosemite, Apple’s Craig Federighi just introduced MailDrop. The new feature addresses a “fundamental problem with email” by allowing users to send large files over email, via iCloud.
* As it sits now, users get the error ‘Cannot send message using the server Mail’ when they go to send larger hi-resolution images or HD video via the Mail app in OS X. But MailDrop fixes this by allowing you to send files via iCloud…
* How it works: if your recipient has a Mac computer, they should just see the file attachement like before. But if they have a Windows computer or another device, they’ll get an encrypted link to iCould where they can download the file.
* Very smart.
