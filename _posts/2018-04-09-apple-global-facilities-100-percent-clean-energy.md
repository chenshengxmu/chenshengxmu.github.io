* Apple today shared an important milestone, saying all of its global offices, data centers, retail stores and co-located facilities in 43 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India, are now powered with 100% clean energy.
* Since 2014, all of Apple’s data centers have been powered by 100% renewable energy.
* Since 2011, all of these projects have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 54% from global facilities and prevented nearly 2.1 million metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere.
* Tim Cook said:
* We’re committed to leaving the world better than we found it. After years of hard work we’re proud to have reached this significant milestone.
* We’re going to keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible with the materials in our products, the way we recycle them, our facilities and our work with suppliers to establish new creative and forward-looking sources of renewable energy because we know the future depends on it.
* Facilities operated by Apple’s suppliers and manufacturers have not switched to 100% renewable sources but Apple is working with some major Chinese companies to bring wind energy and other clean energy sources to power their operations.
* New supplier commitments include:
* In China, for instance, solar panels are mounted high off the ground to let sunlight shine through, so grass can grow and local yaks can eat it.

* The massive Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino is already powered by 100% renewable energy, in part from its 17-megawatt onsite rooftop solar installation.
* Some of Apple’s renewable energy projects include:
* Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said in an interview with Fast Company today that Apple’s been close to the 100% mark for the last couple of years.
* “It’s just 4% more, but it’s 4% done the right way,” she added. ”So this announcement feels like a classic Apple product release. Like our products, we sweat the details, we have pretty strict standards and we prefer to wait and meet our standards than to rush and make a claim.”

* Apple also said today that nine additional manufacturing partners have committed to power all of their Apple production with 100% clean energy, bringing the total number of supplier commitments to 23. The clean energy company Sunseap is an example of an Apple supplier that manages 32 megawatts of solar panels on more than 800 rooftops in Singapore.
