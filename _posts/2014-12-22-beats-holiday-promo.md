* Although this has been running for a couple days now, it’s worth noting that Apple-owned Beats is running a nice holiday promotion that offers discounts on select headphones and speakers and free next-day shipping on all in-stock items at the Apple Online Store.
* As Bryan Wolfe of AppAdvice writes, the special promotion offers the Solo2 headsets for $179.95 instead of the regular $199.95 price point. As for the latest Studio Wireless headsets, they are available for $341.95, normally a $379.95 value.
* According to the promotion terms, the ten percent discount is being offered through Saturday, December 27, excluding Special Edition products like the Hello Kitty Solo2, Hello Kitty urbeats, Fragment Solo2 and Fragment Beats Pill.
* Free one-day shipping is available on all in-stock items found at the Apple Online Store on orders received by 10am PST on Tuesday, December 23, to receive by December 24, excluding certain order types like those paid for with financing or by bank transfer.
* “In-stock items shipped next-day will deliver in one business days from when they leave the warehouse,” says Beats. “Apple reserves the right to change or cancel this promotion at any time,” cautioned the fine print.
* The recently released Solo2 Wireless headphones featured in the above Beats ad are available in blue and white.
* You can shop the discounted Beats headphones and speakers here. Last month, Beats ran its star-studded campaign which motivated fans to snap selfies of themselves while wearing Beats headphones and post images to Twitter with the #SoloSelfie hashtag.
