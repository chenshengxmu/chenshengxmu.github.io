* We are all anxiously waiting for the iPhone 6 launch on Friday, September 19. While some have been lined up for weeks, others constantly refresh their browsers in hopes of seeing their precious pre-ordered device move from one state to another. Currently, most people are simply worried about getting iPhone 6 into their little hands.
* Others also worry about keeping their iPhone protected from the moment it leaves the Apple cocoon. Personally, I am an Apple nudist, but with a penchant for perfection, I hate to see a scratch on my iPhone. Additionally, the rising cost of Apple’s device with the iPhone Plus may also cause some additional interest in keeping the device shielded. Over the weekend, I put together an early iPhone 6 case round up but it appears Spigen hosts one of the largest order-ready inventories. Inside we take a look of all the cases they have to offer. 
* Slim Armor CS

* The Spigen iPhone 6 Slim Armor CS features an “advanced” shock absorbing technology, using a web patterned TPU casing. The TPU and exterior offer a dual layer of protection for the new device. A vertical sliding compartment for card storage closes completely for a flat back. The Slim Armor is available for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Gunmetal, Shimmery White, Mint, and Champagne Gold starting at $12 on Amazon.
* Neo Hybrid EX

* The Neo Hybrid EX is a bumper case with dual layer protection. Using UV coated hard polycarbonate on top of the high polymer coated soft frame lining, offers two impact resistant defenses. Streamlined to the iPhone 6 edges, Neo Hybrid EX is contoured to match the new shape. Metalized buttons offer a premium look and the soft TPU bumper is designed to prevent stretching or sagging over time. The Spigen logo is smaller in this updated version and embossed on a tab behind the device. Port openings are large enough to provide compatibility with some third party accessories. It is available on Amazon starting at $16 in Champagne Gold, Dante Red, Satin Silver, Reventon Yellow, and Infinity White for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Neo Hybrid Metal

* Another entry in the Neo Hybrid line, the Metal edition offers the feel of iPhone 6 by incorporating anodized aluminum. Metal represents a new edition to the Hybrid line, employing the same contoured edges and sag/stretchless inner TPU lining for shock absorption. The included buttons are lined with suede to prevent scratching the iPhone 6 buttons. Inner webbed TPU absorbs and disperses shock. The Neo Hybrid Metal is available on Amazon starting at $19 in Metal Satin Silver, Champagne Gold, Metal Blue, Metal Red, Space Gray for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Neo Hybrid

* The basic Neo Hybrid bumper case provides the same protection as mentioned with the other Neo Hybrid cases: dual layer bumper style protection; hard polycarbonate frame; web-patterned TPU casing; form fitted. The difference lies with the polycarbonate bumper and the back enclosure. Where the EX stops at bumper style protection, this version also offers a complete backing. The Neo Hybrid is available on Amazon starting at $16 in Metal Slate, Gunmetal, Dante Red, Satin Silver, Reventon Yellow, Champagne Gold, Infinity White for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
* Tough Armor and Tough Armor S

![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spigen-iPhone-6-Plus-Case-Tough-Armor.png)
* The Tough Armor case utilizes the Spigen web-patterned TPU casing for advanced shock absorption. The matte TPU and polycarbonate shell offer dual layered protection, which further combines with “AIR CUSHION Corners” and a 4-point rear guard back panel. Power and volume buttons are covered and the port openings are large enough to accommodate third party accessories. Tough Armor is available for iPhone 6 on Amazon starting at $16 in Smooth Black, Champagne Gold, Satin Silver, and Gunmetal.
* Differentiating the Tough Armor for iPhone 6 and Tough Armor for 6 Plus is a kickstand. As seen in the above photographs, the iPhone 6 Plus version includes a flippable onboard kickstand for easy viewing angles. The 6 Plus version is available on Amazon for $15 in Smooth Black, Champagne Gold, Satin Silver, Gunmetal, Electric Blue, Mint, and Metal Slate.
* If you want a kickstand version for iPhone 6, you need to order the Tough Armor S, which includes a slot for your credit card. As seen in the image above, the slot holds your card at an angle made for viewing. Tough Armor S for iPhone 6 only, starts at $16 and is available in Electric Blue, Mint, and Metal Slate.
* Slim Armor and Slim Armor S

![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spigen-iPhone-6-Plus-Slim-Armor.png)
* The same naming convention is utilized for the Slim Armor and Slim Armor S cases. The Slim Armor for iPhone 6 does not offer a kickstand solution, but the iPhone 6 Plus version does. The Slim Armor S is only made for iPhone 6 and provides the thin credit card slot for makeshift angled viewing.
* Slim Armor is an all around protective case with a slimmer profile than the Tough Armor alternative. Double layered in TPU and polycarbonate the case offers dual option protection with a form fitting design. Smoother edges mask the design to match the iPhone 6 form factor while button covers are flush with the sides. The bezel offers a subtle glossy accent and a better grip when reaching across the screen.
* As with most of the iPhone 6 cases, the Air Cushion technology corners provide extra protection. Port holes offer access for third party connections. Slim Armor for iPhone 6 starts at $16 on Amazon in Metal Slate, Electric Red, Shimmery White, Satin Silver, and Gunmetal. Slim Armor S starts at $16 as well in Metal Slate, Mint, Champagne Gold, and Azalea Pink. Slim Armor for 6 Plus begins at XX in Electric Red, Shimmery White, Satin Silver, Gunmetal, Metal Slate, Mint, Champagne Gold, and Azalea Pink.
* Aluminum Fit

* The iPhone 6-only Aluminum Fit case offers true diamond-cut anodized aluminum backplate in a brushed finish. A polycarbonate housing and click case does the heavy lifting with the backplate utilized mostly for aesthetic appeal. The slim case has a bottom opening for third party accessories. The Aluminum Fit simple case is available starting at $13 in Champagne Gold, Metal Slate, Satin Silver, and Space Gray.
* Capella

* Capella brings things to a lighter fair with bright colors and is a new comer to the Spigen line up, sporting a flexible design. Using lightweight TPU encasing and a smooth durable hard back cover, it should appeal to more minimalists than some of the other more rigid cases. Still utilizing the Air Cushioned corners it is a safe case with flashy pastels. The goal is for the case to closely mimic the shape of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The case is compatible with third party accessories. It is available starting at $12 in Mint, Sherbet Pink, Lemon Yellow, Shimmery White, and Azalea Pink.
* Wallet S

* If you prefer to have everything tucked into a single case, the Wallet S is a singular location for all things important when you head out. Three card slots, a cash pocket, and iPhone 6/Plus harness all snap together with a dual sided magnetic strap. The synthetic leather case doubles as a stand for viewing and a cutaway ear piece lets you use the case while closed. Wallet S is available for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus starting at $13 in Black, White, Mint, and Pink.
* Air Skin

* Arguing to be the case for a “naked feel,” Spigen appeals to iPhone nudists with this urethane coated polycarbonate case. The ultra slim form fitted lightweight design is actually getting my attention. At just .4mm the Air Skin utilizes a new technology, compressing polycarbonate to a stable form that still offers protection. A translucent design lets the iPhone show through. The iPhone 6 version is currently available for $11 and up in Soft Clear, Gray, Mint, Azalea Pink, and Champagne Beige.
* Ultra Hybrid

*  
* Spigen’s only true one-piece hybrid case, Ultra Hybrid is a blend of bumper and full enclosure. Ultra Hybrid uses a clear hard back panel with a flexible matte rubber bumper. The slim design sill offers recessed volume and power button protection with Air Cushioned corners for drops and dings. A 4-point rear guard prevents the case from ever completely resting on a flat surface. The same is offered on the front, with lips to prevent the screen from touching. Ultra Hybrid is available for both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus starting at $11 in Champagne Gold, Gunmetal, Metal Slate, Black, Crystal Clear, and Mint.
* Capsule

* A less technical case from the Air, the Capsule is a single flexible, elastic, durable TPU material which is soft to the touch. Air Cushioned technology absorbs shocks and the slim form-fitted design keeps the iPhone 6 curves. The yellow-resistant coating will keep the transparency and a small bezel lip will protect the screen. Capsule is available for the iPhone 6 Plus in Crystal Clear only for $8. iPhone 6 versions start at $8 and come in Crystal Clear, Black, and Gray.
* Thin Fit and Thin Fit (A)

* The Thin Fit and Thin Fit A are only differentiated by the Apple logo cutaway on the “A” version. This thin form fitting case uses a soft matte feeling coat that is non slip and prevents fingerprints. A durable and lightweight design, Slim Fit uses a polycarbonate to resist external impacts. The design is “precisely” form fitted to the iPhone 6 curvature. Thin Fit is available for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus starting at $10 in Smooth Black, Shimmery White, Mint, and Crystal Clear. The “A” series is also available for both devices in Metal Slate, Satin Silver, Champagne Gold, and Gunmetal.
* GLAS.tR SLIM
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spigen-GLAS.tR-Slim-iPhone-6.png)
* An oleophobic coating prevents fingerprints and contaminants on this new 28% thinner version of Spigen’s popular glass screen protector, GLAS.tR SLIM. The “R”ounded edges help disperse shock and the surface is strong enough to resist knives and keys. There is a slight wait for these screen covers because of the need for an exact fit. The iPhone 6 version is available for $15 and will be in stock on September 30, while the iPhone 6 Plus option is $16 and will not be available until October 30.
* Will you be ordering any Spigen cases? If so, which one?
