* Contradicting a February 2015 report which asserted that Beats Music would get folded into a new on-demand streaming music subscription service, The Wall Street Journal said Monday that Beats Music will be maintained as a standalone service once Apple launches its new music $10 per month offering at WWDC next week.
* Apple, the world’s leading music retailer, is apparently “prepared to cannibalize its download business in favor of streaming.” As part of an all-in bet, Apple may prompt people “who download a $10 album to instead subscribe to the streaming service for $10 a month.”
* The new “set of music services” will cost $10 per month, like Spotify, and is said to include “augmented Internet radio” with DJs.
* Citing people familiar with the plan, the financial newspaper claims that Apple’s new offering “won’t let listeners stream its entire music catalog on demand free of charge.”
* Instead, the privilege of unlimited music streaming will set you back ten bucks per month. In addition, Apple plans to augment its free, ad-supported Internet radio service called iTunes Radio with channels programmed and hosted by human DJs.
* Earlier this morning, The New York Post learned that some of these DJs are A-list names such as Drake, Pharrell Williams and David Guetta.
* Unlike WSJ, The New York Post wrote that Apple wants to offer a three-month free trial but the plan may be put on hold as Apple is reportedly demanding that record labels give it rights for free during the trial period.
* As WSJ reported, music industry executives reportedly see Apple’s upcoming service as “a watershed moment for streaming music that could move the technology from early adopters to the mainstream.”
* If history is an indication, the new service could indeed hit the ground running in no time given Apple’s more than 800 million iTunes accounts with credit card on file.
* If the company is going to take the wraps off the new service soon, the best place to do so would be its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off with a keynote next Monday.
* Beats Music is available in the App Store at no charge.
