* Apple typically takes the iPhone’s A-series chips and updates them for iPads with more GPU cores and a faster performing, higher-clocked CPU. These chips typically have an “X” in their name, but with new iPad Pros and a fifth-generation iPad mini due in Spring 2017 the company has not yet officially announced an “X” variant of the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip.
* Today, a source on Chinese social network Weibo posted alleged synthetic GeekBench 4 benchmark scores that could indicate at least one-fifth faster CPU performance in both single-core and dual-core computing for the purported A10X Fusion chip.
* Current iPad Pro models are powered by the Apple-designed A9X chip.
* Compared to the A9X, the assumed A10X Fusion appears to be 34 percent faster in single-core tests and 27.4 percent faster in multi-core than the iPad Pro’s A9x chip.

* Compared with the official GeekBench 4 scores for the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip, the alleged A10X Fusion silicon appears to be 21.9 percent faster in single-core performance and 19.8 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance.
* Please note that these benchmarks can be easily faked and there’s no way of telling whether these scores are genuine or not. That said, we’re going to assume they’re faked until someone posts them on the GeekBench website.
