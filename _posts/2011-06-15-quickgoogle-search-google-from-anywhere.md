* I can’t believe that I’m just now finding a tweak that lets you search Google from anywhere. There’s another tweak out there that does something similar, right?
* If not, I’m shocked that it took this long to get a tweak like QuickGoogle on the Cydia store, but the good news is that it’s here, and it works marvelously.
* QuickGoogle is a very simple tweak that uses an Activator action to pull up a Google search pop up notification box anytime and anywhere you please. Want to see how QuickGoogle performs in action? Then check inside for the full video walkthrough…
* As you can see, this is about as straightforward as you can get. Simply install the tweak, go into Activator, and set up the Activator action of your choice.
* I, of course, decided to roll with the “shake device” action, so I can aptly call this combination “shake to search.”
* Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? Shake to search.
* I really like this tweak if you cannot tell, but it is unfortunate that the developer missed a prime opportunity to flesh it out by adding image search and news search as toggle options on the pop-up notification. Perhaps we’ll see a more fleshed out version in a future update.
* Have you had the opportunity to try out QuickGoogle? If so, I’m interested in hearing your thoughts on the tweak.
* Also, let me know if there’s another app or tweak available on Cydia that does something similar.
