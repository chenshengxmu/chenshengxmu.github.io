* Roughly a month after the last major Apple Watch software update, Apple has released watchOS 4.2, bringing support for Apple Pay Cash, among other changes.
* Those other small changes include a new workout type for third-party apps to track different metrics (distance, speed, elevation descended for downhill snow sports, number of runs), as well as support for HomeKit sprinklers and faucets.
* Apple fixed a bug related to Siri where your Apple Watch could restart when you asked about the weather. An alarm/timer dismissal bug, and an issue that disabled scrolling in the Heart Rate app for certain users have also been fixed in this update.

* The biggest new feature is clearly Apple Pay Cash support, which we went hands on with before it officially launched today.
* iOS 11.2 and tvOS 11.2 were also recently released.
* To update your Apple Watch, be sure it is within range of your iPhone, on its charger, and has at least 50% battery life. Then visit the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, then go to General > Software Update.
