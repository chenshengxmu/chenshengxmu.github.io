* Apple plans to set up a new research and development center in China’s manufacturing capital Shenzhen, reports Shenzhen Economic Daily (via Reuters). The outlet says Tim Cook announced the plan during a meeting with senior city officials while attending a nation-wide event on innovation. Apparently Foxconn CEO Terry Gou was also in attendance.
* “We are excited to be opening a new Research and Development center here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners,” Cupertino-based Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in emailed comments.
* “The Shenzhen center, along with the Beijing center, is also aimed at strengthening relationships with local partners and universities as we work to support talent development across the country,” he said.
* The announcement follows a similar one Cook made in August regarding the opening of an Apple R&D facility in Beijing. The moves are a part of Apple’s ongoing efforts to spur growth in the world’s second largest economy against increasing competition. It sounds like one of the main focuses for the Shenzhen center will be attracting software developer talent.
