* Microsoft revealed in its filing with the Security and Exchange Commission that come October 26 it will launch both Windows 8 operating system for consumers and the Surface tablet which was announced a month and half ago. Apple, of course, is expected to unveil a rumored cheaper, smaller iPad at a media event this fall (iLounge says in November) and launch a fourth-generation iPad some time during the first quarter of next year…
* According to Microsoft’s 10-K filing with the Security and Exchange Commission (via AllThingsD):
* The next version of our operating system, Windows 8, will be generally available on October 26, 2012. At that time, we will begin selling the Surface, a series of Microsoft-designed and manufactured hardware devices.
* The Surface is designed to compete with the iPad on the high-end. No price point was known at press time apart from Microsoft’s previously stated ‘comparable-to-notebooks’ hint, which some think could mean around a thousand dollar mark for the more powerful Intel-powered model.
* Microsoft should be especially concerned over new data suggesting that iPad is widening its lead in enterprise over Android tablets. Redmond also has OEMs to worry about.
* Acer CEO recently hinted as much, saying the Surface is just a ploy to drive Windows 8 adoption. Microsoft’s own SEC filing reveals that the company is competing with PC makers now:
* Our Surface devices will compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform”. If Windows 8 doesn’t become popular enough, that could “make it more difficult to attract applications developers to our platforms,” Microsoft also warned.
* From Amazon, half a dozen smaller Kindle Fire tablets are coming ahead of the holiday season to claim the low-end, including a new ten-inch model that will take the iPad head on.
* Are you still excited about the Surface now that Google’s Nexus 7 is making waves?
