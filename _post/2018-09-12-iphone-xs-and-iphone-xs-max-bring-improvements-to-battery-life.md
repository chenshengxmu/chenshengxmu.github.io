* As if Apple’s iPhone X didn’t already provide amazing all-day battery life, Apple shattered these capabilities with its newly-announced handsets: the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max.
* Citing Apple’s own Phil Schiller, the iPhone Xs offers a 30-minute battery life bump over the previous-generation iPhone X. The gains are impressive considering the handset’s augmented hardware and powerful capabilities.
* As you might expect, however, the iPhone Xs Max sports a much larger surface area. Apple’s engineers took full advantage of the extra space to house a larger battery capable of lasting one full hour and 30 minutes longer than the iPhone X.
* It’s worth noting that the the iPhone Xs’ battery gains over the previous-generation iPhone X are within a margin of error. That said, your mileage may vary depending on how you use your device. On the iPhone Xs Max, however, we’re expecting to see real-world results as the battery is physically larger.
* Given just how crucial battery life is to smartphone owners these days, it’s nothing less than exciting to hear how we can expect improved results from Apple’s latest handsets.
