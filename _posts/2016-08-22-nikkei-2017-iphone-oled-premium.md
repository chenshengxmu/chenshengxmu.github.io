* As you may have probably heard by now, Apple is expected to save its most significant smartphone overhaul—which many rumors said would include a wraparound screen based on advanced organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display technology—for the Tenth Anniversary iPhone next year.
* Japanese outlet Nikkei said today that Apple will position an AMOLED iPhone as a new premium choice. The device should come with a screen possibly measuring more than 5.5 inches diagonally. Moreover, existing 4.7 and 5.5-inch models will be updated next year, too, but are expected to retain flat screens like existing iPhones.
* “There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5 inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5 inches or larger, equipped with a screen bent on the two sides,” a source told Nikkei.
* David Hsieh, a senior director at market reserach specialist IHS DisplaySearch, told the publication that although the rumored premium model will adopt power-saving AMOLED panels, the other two models will stick to existing LTPS panels.
* Unlike LPTS screens, AMOLEDs offer sharper color contrast, higher saturation, deeper blacks and increased pixel count while being flexible. The analyst said that Samsung will be Apple’s sole OLED supplier next year, but cautioned that the South Korean company won’t be able to fully meet demand for both itself and Apple.
