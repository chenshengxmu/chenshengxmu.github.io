title: Try These Sites If Youre Having Issues With JailbreakMe
---
* I usually leave it up to Sebastien to provide our loyal readers with the jailbreak information but I’ll take the reigns this time. PMP Today has posted a couple of alternative sites for those wishing to jailbreak their iPhone after individuals claimed they were having difficulties performing the hack with JailbreakMe.

* If you’re among those experiencing troubles with the self titled URL, it is recommended that you try using jailbreakme.com/index.html or accessing the Canadian site of jailbreakme.ca to perform the process. If none of those work for you, you can always try what iDB reader Joe suggested by visiting jailbreakme.com/blob.html from your iPhone.
* All Apple touch screens up to iOS 4.0.1 can be jailbroken however iDB reported the Dev Team will not be releasing a jailbreak for iOS 4.0.2. Version 3.2.2 of the iPad firmware is also not accessible due to the exploit only being available in the newer versions of the operating system.
* Have you had any issues with JailbreakMe? If so you can try these alternatives and let us know how they performed. As always I remind you that jailbreaking your device can cause issues you may not be able to reverse and your warranty may be voided. Good luck!
