* Android users have been able to enjoy WhatsApp’s Web interface for a while now, while iOS users have been left longing for the feature. The WhatsApp Web interface allows you to carry on and continue conversations from a web browser on your desktop, which is great for those times when you’re seated and working.
* Thankfully, there is a way to enable the WhatsApp Web feature directly from your iPhone, but you’ll need to be jailbroken to do so. It’s called WhatsApp Web Enabler, and we’ll show you how to use it in this step-by-step video tutorial.
* Note: You must be jailbroken in order to follow this tutorial
* Step 1: Make sure you have WhatsApp installed on your iPhone
* Step 2: Open Cydia and search for WhatsApp Web Enabler and install it

* Step 6: On your desktop go to web.whatsapp.com in your web browser (Chrome, FireFox, or Opera. Safari is not supported)
* Step 7: Aim your phone at the QR code on your desktop’s browser, and you should be automatically signed in to the WhatsApp Web interface
* Be sure to watch our video walkthrough of the entire process above. It only take a few minutes to gain access to the web interface from the iPhone, and it’s totally worth doing if you’re jailbroken.
