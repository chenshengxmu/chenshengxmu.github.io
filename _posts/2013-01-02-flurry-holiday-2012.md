* Good news for developers: iOS and Android together accounted for a massive 1.76 billion app downloads around the world between Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, per research by ad firm Flurry. That’s more than a marked improvement compared to the 1.2 billion apps that were downloaded last year across both Android and iOS. Think about it, 1.76 billion downloads in just seven days.
* In fact, a number of weeks since late November delivered more than a billion downloads. It wasn’t that long ago that a billion downloads was considered a remarkable achievement throughout the span of the entire year, let alone weeks or months.
* And if that data point didn’t give you a pause, consider this: based on historical data, Flurry expects app downloads to regularly hit the one billion milestone each week going forward. Doing a quick math in your head, at that rate both iOS and Android should account for at least 52 billion downloads in 2013…
* Flurry marketing VP Peter Farago writes in a blog post:
* Looking forward to 2013, Flurry expects the trend of one-billion-download weeks to become the norm, and that the industry will surpass the two-billion download week during Q4.
* If you’ve been wondering, some 50+ million iOS and Android tablets and smartphones were activated from Christmas to New Year’s Eve, per Flurry’s data.
* Here’s your breakdown by country.

* As for the whole 2012, ABI Research (via TechCrunch) estimates that mobile app stores worldwide generated 43.6 billion downloads in the twelve months ending September 2012.
* And in terms of implementation and innovation measured on an overall scale of 100, Apple is first with a score of 80.8 out of 100. Android came second at 72.2 and Microsoft is a distant third with an overall score of 63.9 out of 100, but it actually beat Apple with a total innovation score of 77 points compared to 76 for Apple.
* Microsoft won on the innovation front due to its better app discoverability, says ABI analyst Aapo Markkanen:
* An app with a modest-but-loyal and highly-engaged user base gets a boost over an app that may see boatloads of downloads but fails to retain its users. It’s important because this favors quality apps with modest post-launch budgets over mediocre apps that throw a lot of money at ad networks and other forms of marketing.
* He also likes Microsoft’s transparency concerning its chart algorithm, which is all that more important knowing storefront charts can be real kingmakers in app discovery.

* Microsoft’s store has 200,000 apps versus more than 700,000 for iOS and over 600,000 for the Google Play store.

* Now, as much as these numbers are mind-boggling, I would like to see some in-depth analysis of the stickiness of apps because only a small fraction of the downloaded apps get used regularly. I also suspect many apps are run just once and some not even once.
* Big numbers notwithstanding, what really matters here is loyalty.
* What good are milestones if people ain’t actually using your content?
* Just ask The Next Web…
