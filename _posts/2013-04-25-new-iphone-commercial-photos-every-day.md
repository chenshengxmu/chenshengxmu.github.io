* Apple has posted a new commercial on its website and on its YouTube channel, and it’s one of the better ones I’ve seen in recent memory. The video — entitled Photos Every Day — is a montage of the many ways that people use their iPhone’s to take photos in everyday situations. The commercial ends by saying: “Everyday, more photos are taken with the iPhone than any other camera.”
* I guess the main word that pops into my head when I watch this is: human. What about you?
