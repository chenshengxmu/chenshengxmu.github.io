* Apple on Thursday seeded the first betas of iOS 11.1, macOS 10.13.1, and tvOS 11.1 to public testers. The updates come just a day after the arrival of the developer betas, and shortly after iOS 11, macOS 10.13 and tvOS 11 hit consumer devices.
* Public betas are available to those who are enrolled in Apple’s free Beta Software Program. Once you’re signed up, and your devices are registered, you can access future iOS, macOS and tvOS betas using each platform’s over-the-air Update mechanism.

* In yesterday’s developer beta, we discovered iOS 11.1 includes some small changes, such as no more haptic feedback on wrong passcode entry on the Lock screen, and multiple emoji keyboard suggestions. There’s also new animations and Health app UI tweaks.
* As for macOS 10.13.1 and tvOS 11.1, the updates seem even less significant. But as usual, if we spot any notable changes in the software, we’ll be sure to pass them along.
