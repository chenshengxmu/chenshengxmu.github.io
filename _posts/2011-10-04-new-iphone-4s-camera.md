* The iPhone 4 turned out to be one of the world’s most popular cameras. It was one of the first smartphones that literally started taking the place of every day point-and-shoot picture-takers.
* With the iPhone 4S, Apple is looking to build on that success with its all-new 8MP camera. The sensor is capable of capturing 3264 x 2448 photos — 60% more pixels than the iPhone 4. And there’s much, much more…
* On top of its additional pixels, the new 8MP camera sensor can gather in 73% more light than the previous model. It also houses a hybrid IR filter for richer colors, and it’s super fast. It takes just 1.1 seconds to snap its first photo.
* And as for video recording? The new iPhone 4S records in full 1080P HD, and includes built-in image stabilization and a temporal noise reduction filter to ensure that all of your videos look first class. Not bad for a cell phone.
