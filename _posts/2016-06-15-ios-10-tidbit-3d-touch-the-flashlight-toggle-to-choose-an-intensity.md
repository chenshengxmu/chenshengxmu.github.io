* Apple originally introduced Control Center in iOS 7, which was their way of answering both the competition on multiple Android platforms and the jailbreak community in one fell swoop.
* With iOS 10, which Apple announced at the WWDC 2016 Keynote this week, Apple has shown off some obvious changes to Control Center, including a modular paged navigation design and different color tones and styles.
* Of course, aesthetic wasn’t the only change. Apple also made the flashlight toggle button from Control Center a whole lot more useful as well.
* With iOS 10, whenever you want to use the flashlight feature on your iPhone from Control Center, you can use a 3D Touch gesture on the Flashlight toggle button to choose between three different intensity modes.
* The three modes are low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity, and each provide a different brightness setting that may be better suited to the needs of the user.
* Being an everyday flashlight user myself, I like how my higher-end LED flashlights have brightness settings built into them that help me see just right in the different conditions I use my flashlight in.
* Lower intensity beams work well for places where too bright of a light would whitewash everything and make it too difficult to see smaller objects at a close range, while higher intensity beams would work well in situations where you needed to see a great distance.
* The intensity settings also give users a way to control their battery consumption from the rear-facing flash when they opt to use it as a flashlight rather than as a flash for their cameras.
* With Apple bringing this feature to the rear-facing flash flashlight on the iPhone, it makes the device feel more like a real LED flashlight when using the feature.
* These changes illustrate how Apple is using iOS 10 as a way to build off of the 3D Touch functionality of the iPhone 6s display that was originally under-used in iOS 9.
* Apple appears to be polishing up the new gesture and making 3D Touch more consistent throughout iOS as a whole.
* The 3D Touch experience was very much open-ended with its original launch and was confusing to use because it would work in some places you’d expect it to work and not in others.
* I see the flashlight intensity feature as a hidden Easter egg in iOS 10 because I use the flashlight so much that I know the intensity level can be an issue in some cases.
* Having the ability to choose between a dim light source or a super-charged high intensity beam provides for a whole lot more flexibility in using your iPhone as a flashlight.
* Are you excited to see this change in iOS 10? Share in the comments!
