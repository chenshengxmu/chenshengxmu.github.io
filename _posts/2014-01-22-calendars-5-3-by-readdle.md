* App maker Readdle launched its iOS 7-ready Calendars 5 application last September, just a few days following the public launch of iOS 7. Both the free and paid Calendars apps have now been bumped to version 5.3 in what Readdle says is “our biggest update since the launch”.
* Calendars 5.3 focuses on making it easier to send or accept event invitations by adding new features to manage meetings, conference calls and any activity that involves other people…
* You can now finally send and accept event invitations to meetings and events.
* “Just type ‘Dinner with John’ and see what happens,” Readdle said.
* Another new feature: .ICS file importing.
* .ICS is a filename extension for iCalendar files which are widely used on the web to send meeting requests and tasks to other users. Apple’s stock iOS and OS X apps support .ICS files out of the box and now you can easily import .ICS email attachments right into Calendars 5. The app will automatically extract the events from the imported files.
* Finally, this edition of Calendars makes it real simple to manage all your notifications in one place. And when you accept or reject invitations, the app will now automatically send notifications to the inviting party so they could immediately tell whether you’re attending or not.
* Here, check out Readdle’s Calendars video walthrough, from four months ago.
* The premium Calendars 5.3 edition is available for $6.99 in the App Store.
* Or, download the free edition to see what all the fuss is about.
* Both versions are universal and require iOS 6.0 or later.
