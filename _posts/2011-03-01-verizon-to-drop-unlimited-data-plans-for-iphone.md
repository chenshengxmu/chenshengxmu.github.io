title: Verizon to Drop Unlimited Data Plans for iPhone

* Until today, one of the most compelling reasons to switch to Verizon for the iPhone was that big red still offered unlimited data plans, whereas AT&T had long been on a tiered pricing model. It seems the gap between the 2 carriers is getting a bit smaller as according to Verizon CFO himself, Verizon is going to stop offering unlimited data plans to its customer as soon as this summer.
* A few weeks ago, we reported about Verizon’s plans to throttle data speed and start compressing images and videos in order to allow available network capacity to benefit the greatest number of users…
* Now that they don’t have this competitive advantage, the only compelling reason remaining to switch from AT&T to Verizon is the call quality which is much better than AT&T’s.
* While Verizon is starting limiting its customers, AT&T has been on a generosity spree, offering unlimited data back to some lucky customers, free mobile to mobile calls, and more.
* There is no word on what these data plans will look like but it’s safe to assume they probably will match AT&T’s.
* Still in love with your Verizon iPhone?
