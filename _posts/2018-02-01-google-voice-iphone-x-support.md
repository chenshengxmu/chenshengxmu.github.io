* The Google Voice app now supports the new iPhone X display resolution.
* In release notes accompanying the app’s version 2.13 update, Google mentions iPhone X support as well as the usual fixes and performance improvements. With full support for the edge-to-edge OLED panel of your iPhone X, Google Voice takes full advantage of the phone’s resolution which lets it run without the horizontal black bars at the top and bottom.
* Google Voice is a US-only VoIP and telephony service that gives you a free phone number for calling, text messaging and voicemail. It synchronizes seamlessly across your mobile and desktop devices so you can use the app while on the go or at home.
* Here are a few key features of the app:
* Google Voice for iOS has been neglected for years. For instance, it took Google almost a year following the major iOS 7 update to refresh the app with new iOS 7 features and styling.
* The app requires iOS 9 or later.
* Google Voice is a free download from App Store.
