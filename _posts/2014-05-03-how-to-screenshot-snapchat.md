* Snapchat is designed so that all photos, videos and chats disappear after a predetermined amount of time set by the sender, such as 5 or 10 seconds. The whole point of the social networking app is that anything sent between users is not considered permanent, unless of course the recipient decides to take a screenshot of that Snapchat. But when someone takes a screenshot of a snap, the sender is provided with a notification alongside the number of screenshots taken.
* As you might expect, there are more than a few ways to take a screenshot of Snapchat in secret. A myriad of apps are available on the App Store for saving Snapchat photos and videos, plus two options for jailbroken users. Just keep in mind that none of these methods are guaranteed to be fail proof, and I imagine most people would be uncomfortable having their snaps saved without knowing. But if you must, here is how to screenshot Snapchat without the other person knowing…
* There have been many variations of this method over the years, and it seems this trick still works. It lets you take a screenshot of a snap without sending a notification. Granted, it’s a bit cumbersome, but it does work.
* 1) Launch Snapchat.
* 2) Turn on Airplane Mode.
* 3) Open the snap you want to grab and screenshot it.
* 4) Hold the Power button on your iPhone until you see the “slide to power off” option.
* 5) Once the “slide to power off” option appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Home button until the app is forced close.
* 6) Turn Airplane Mode off.
* At this point, you can safely launch the Snapchat app again and even go to the snap you just screenshot. It should appear as if you had never opened it before.
* If you have a Mac, you can use QuickTime to record what is happening on your iPhone screen. This is probably the best way to screenshot Snapchat without sending a notification, but obviously, you will have to have your Mac handy.
* We wrote a tutorial on how to record your iPhone screen that you can follow. Directions are fairly simple. You need to plug your iPhone into your Mac, launch QuickTime, create a new recording and select your iPhone as the source. This will create a video of anything happening on your iPhone. Using the created video, you can then easily extract screenshots.

* To my knowledge, there is currently only one app that lets you have the best of Snapchat, and it’s called Sneakaboo, previously known as Snap-Hack. Available for free in the App Store, the app lets you save screenshots without sending any sort of notification. Although the app is pretty ugly, it definitely delivers on its unspoken promise.
* The concept is simple. Just download the app and sign into it with using your Snapchat username and password. Newly received snaps or stories will appear inside the app, from where you can easily screenshot or save anything, including snaps and videos.
* As mentioned above, the app is completely free, but it works on a coin basis. The first time you sign into the app, you will be given 6 coins. Saving a snap or video via the app will cost you one coin each time. Once you have used all your free coins, you can either buy unlimited coins for $4.99 via an in-app purchase, or you can participate in survey and such to gain coins.
* Again this not a pretty app, but I can definitely confirm it works. You can download Sneakaboo for free in the App Store.

* If you would prefer to avoid the App Store and use a jailbreak tweak instead, you’re in luck. Snapchat Log is a free package on Cydia in the BigBoss repository that records all of your sent and received snaps on Snapchat. The other person is never notified of this behavior, and you can store as many old snaps as desired. Snapchat Log is integrated directly into Snapchat with a button to open it, accessible by tapping the settings icon in the top-right corner.

* As suggested by our readers, Phantom for Snapchat is also a great jailbreak tweak for gaining fine-tuned control over Snapchat. The tweak integrates directly within Snapchat to provide several features, including the ability to permanently keep snaps, disable the hold gesture for keeping snaps open, automatically save sent photos and videos, select multiple contacts at once, type unlimited text for captions, crop images and more. Phantom is free on Cydia in the BigBoss repo.
* There are other jailbreak tweaks that allow you to take screenshots without sending notifications, but also offer tons of additional features that basically remove any limitation from Snapchat. Such jailbreak tweaks include Snap + for Snapchat, and GhostPrefs.
* These apps used to be available in the App Store and worked good. To our knowledge, they aren’t available in the App Store anymore, but may be available on other platforms such as the Google Play store.

* Snapkeep is probably the most ideal app for saving Snapchat photos and videos without the other person knowing, since it has no advertisements or payment system. Simply authenticate your Snapchat username and password, and all unopened snaps are displayed.
* Those files can then be saved to your Camera Roll with the tap of one button. You must save the snap in Snapkeep before viewing it through the official Snapchat app, or it is permanently deleted. The other person will not be notified that a screenshot was taken.

* SnapBox provides the same functionality as Snapkeep, showing a list of unopened photo and video snaps after you authenticate with your Snapchat username and password. The only difference with this app is that it functions on a coin-based system, meaning that you must pay one coin for each snap you save.
* Coins can be earned for free by completing in-app surveys and promotions, while unlimited coins are available as a $2.99 in-app purchase. You would probably be wise to stick with Snapkeep above, since it’s free to use.

* SnapSpy also allows you to save Snapchat photos and videos in secret, providing users with 50 coins to start. Each time you save a snap, one coin is used. Additional coins can be earned by completing sponsored offers, or by purchasing the pro version of this app for $0.99.
* Again, you would be best to save your money and simply use Snapkeep above. But if SnapSpy is your cup of tea, it’s free on the App Store with in-app banner advertisements. As with the other apps, you must authenticate your Snapchat username and password each time.

* KeepSnap rounds off a series of four apps that deliver the exact same functionality, displaying a list of sent and received snaps that can be saved to Camera Roll. You must first authenticate with your Snapchat username and password, and be prepared to deal with in-app banner advertisements.
* I suppose it never hurts to have options, but I would once again just stick with Snapkeep above. It is the only app out of these four that lets you save Snapchat photos and videos without the hassle of advertisements, sponsored offers or the need to purchase a professional version.
