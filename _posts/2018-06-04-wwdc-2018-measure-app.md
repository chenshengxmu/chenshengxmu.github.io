* During its ARKit 2.0 introduction at its WWDC 2018 keynote, Apple unveiled a new augmented reality app it’s created called Measure. As you’d expect, the software was designed to help you digitally measure things using your iOS device’s camera.
* SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi demonstrated the app on stage by measuring a suitcase, but it can also be used to measure photographs for framing and other things. There, of course, are hundreds of AR measurement apps already in the App Store. But it’s notable that Apple now has a a first-party option.
* Here’s Apple’s official description on the app from its website:
* Measure is a new app in iOS 12, which uses AR to quickly gauge the size of real-world objects similar to a tape measure. The new app automatically provides the dimensions of objects like picture frames, posters and signs, and can also show diagonal measurements, compute area and allow users to take a photo and share it with accurate dimensions right from their iPhone or iPad.
* We haven’t heard a release date for Measure yet, but when we do we’ll be sure to pass it along.
