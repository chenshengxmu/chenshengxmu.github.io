* Apple could also offer some smart protection for its smaller iPad when it launches tomorrow, a new report alleges. As you’re aware, Apple is currently offering polyurethane and leather Smart Cover cases for the current 9.7-inch iPad 3 and iPad 2, priced at $39 for the polyurethane version. If you want leather, that’ll be a $30 extra. Per this new price list which surfaced this morning, Apple-branded covers for the iPad mini should also retail at $39. Part numbers also indicate a possible brand new iPad protection product…
* 9to5Mac editor Seth Weintraub has the story:
* Along with the iPad Mini pricing we received over the weekend, we also received a number of separate parts priced at $39 US which have similar SKUs as Apple’s Smart Cases and Smart Covers.
* While not positive on the veracity of the cited price list, the author goes on to note that these stock-keeping units (SKUs) fit in the lineup, with the numbers indicating they will be available in a variety of colors. It’s also possible the new SKUs represent refreshed cases for existing iPads instead for their iPad mini counterparts.
* Notice the same color codes: DG = dark grey, LG = light grey, P = pink, G = green, B = blue. The only mystery is an SKU labeled MD828FE/A, which could indicate an entirely new case.
* Perhaps something aimed at students, given the iPad mini’s alleged focus on education?

* The same blog previously leaked an alleged price list suggesting the iPad mini will start at $329 in the United States.
* As for the Smart Cover cases, I think Apple has no reason to keep these exclusive to full-sized iPads.
* On the other hand, it’s a tad surprising that Smart Cover products for both the 9.7-inch and 7.86-inch iPad would cost the same.
* What do you think?
