* We’ve been waiting for months to see evidence that an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 is indeed ready for prime time, and pod2g of the Chronic Dev Team has just released a demo video of the iOS 5 untether to wet our appetites.
* The simple video indicates that the highly-anticipated jailbreak is nearly ready. However, we don’t have an exact ETA on when it will arrive.
* Refer to our last state of the jailbreak post to learn everything you need to know about the iOS 5 jailbreak. The Chronic Dev Team recently introduced a tool for jailbreakers to use that indirectly helps find exploits for an untether. Both the Dev and Chronic Dev teams are working to bring us the iOS 5 jailbreak that we’ve all been waiting for.
