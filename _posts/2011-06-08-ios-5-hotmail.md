* I remember a few years ago when the iPhone first came out, getting your Hotmail emails on the Email app was just a struggle. Then Microsoft figured it out and let its users easily set up Hotmail on the iPhone and other devices.
* Adding an Hotmail account on the iPhone is going to be even easier with iOS 5 as it is now a default option, just like Gmail, Yahoo, or AOL are…
* To add your Hotmail account, simply go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account > Windows Live Hotmail. From there, add your Hotmail email address as well as your password, select what info you want to sync (emails, contacts, calendars), and you’re good to go.
* Are there any Hotmail users left?
