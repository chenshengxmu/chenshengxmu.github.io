* The Pangu team has just released an update to their untethered jailbreak. Users who are already jailbroken can venture into the Pangu app on the Home screen in order to update.
* The incremental update fixes the Cydia Substrate loading issue upon reboot, iMessage picture sending, and Safari bugs. It’s advised that all jailbroken users update now.
* Note: It’s recommended that you do not set a passcode on your jailbroken device due to boot loop issues that many are incurring. This issue is being worked on as well.
* To update, launch the Pangu app, which should be located on your Home screen and tap the Manager tab at the bottom of the screen. There, under the update tab, you should see the Pangu 8.0-8.1.x Untether update. Tap the download (arrow) button to install the update.
* After tapping the update button, the new untether .deb file will download, and you’ll be prompted to reboot your device to install the update untether.
* About update: If you already installed MobileSubstrate and other tweaks, for some compatibility issues, this (cont) http://t.co/agqQVC0nxv

* The actual Pangu jailbreak tool has yet to be update from version 1.0.1, but we presume that is coming shortly as well. For now, if you want to run the latest version of the Pangu untether, you’ll need to jailbreak using the tool, then update post jailbreak.
* Have you updated yet? Does it fix many of the issues you’ve experienced with the Pangu jailbreak? Sound off down below.
