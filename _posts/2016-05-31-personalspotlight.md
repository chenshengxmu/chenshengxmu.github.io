* iOS 9 came with a totally new Spotlight experience for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, but there still remains a lot that could be changed to better suit individual users’ needs.
* Thanks to the jailbreak community, however, customization is never really a problem.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called PersonalSpotlight is now available that gives users the ability to personalize their Spotlight experience in a way that better suits them, and we’ll show you how the tweak works as we go hands-on in this review.
* Out of the box, Spotlight is undoubtedly a great feature of iOS. With it, you can easily find anything you need to with a search field. Thanks to Spotlight APIs, third-party app developers can even tap into Spotlight to let you find things from third-party apps too.
* On the other hand, there are some features of this really powerful tool that could be personalized to better fit some individuals, and PersonalSpotlight is a tweak that aims to give jailbreakers the ability to take control of Spotlight’s appearance and behavior.
* The tweak is ultimately pretty simple. After you install it, you’ll find a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can customize your own personal Spotlight experience.

* Among the things the tweak lets you do are:
* As you can see right off the bat, the tweak has a mix of both cosmetic and functional options you can change for Spotlight.
* Among some of my favorite features are keeping your recent searches from appearing in the search field and keeping apps from being launched from Spotlight. I find these useful because it keeps others from knowing what I searched for last, and it also keeps me from accidentally launching apps when I am scrolling through search results in Spotlight.
* Many of the cosmetic changes are minimal – some goofier than others – but I find that the tweak shines with functional changes the most. Just for the two features I mentioned above, this is something I might consider using on my daily driver if it were actually jailbroken.
* Of course, as a free download, this is something you can try out for yourself and decide whether or not you like what the tweak has to offer.
* You can download PersonalSpotlight for free right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with iOS 9 devices and is compatible with both Spotlight interfaces in iOS: the one you swipe down to get to, and the one you swipe right to get to.
* If you’re looking to modify Spotlight’s appearance and functionality in any way, then this tweak is a great place to start.
