* Over the past few months, T-Mobile has been touting its plans to upgrade its wireless network to be more friendly with Appleâ€™s smartphone. Despite not being an official partner, the carrier sees a lot of business from unlocked iPhone users.
* The upgrade, which allows iPhone users to enjoy 3G data speeds, has already startedÂ rolling out to a handful of areas. So that has some T-Mobile subscribers wondering, will they get to keep their old data plans on the new, faster network?
* According to T-Mobileâ€™s Twitter account, yes, they will:
* @unimp0rtanttech Whether you are on 2G or 3G we charge the same for data, your account wont change due to the 1900 refarm ðŸ™‚ ^KM
* â€” T-Mobile USA (@TMobileHelp) June 27, 2012
* Typically when carriers upgrade their networks â€” i.e. make them faster â€” they donâ€™t allow customers to hold on to old service plans. Verizon, for example, is looking to kick subscribers off of their unlimited data plans as they upgrade to LTE. So itâ€™s awesome that T-Mobile is allowing subscribers to keep theirs.
* But we donâ€™t expect this to last forever, especially if by some miracle T-Mobile finally lands the iPhone this fall (thereâ€™s no way it could afford to subsidize the handset $400 on these plans). So if youâ€™ve been thinking about moving your iPhone to T-Mobile, you may want to do it sooner, rather than later.
