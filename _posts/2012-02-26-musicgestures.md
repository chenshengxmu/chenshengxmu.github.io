* MusicGestures is a jailbreak tweak that lends the ability to control the stock Music app with gestures instead of button presses. There are a total of 6 actions (7 if you count disabled as an action) that you can assign to any number of gestures.
* The gestures can be used to skip, play, pause, and gather info on both the album cover view, and the individual track view.
* It’s not the deepest tweak in the shed, but the simplicity of MusicGestures makes it worth a look…
* For a free jailbreak tweak, MusicGestures is a solid alternative to an app like Music Controls Pro, if you’re only interested in having gesture based control for the stock music app.
* If you want an insanely deep Music app tweak that features gesture based control, you may want to give Music Controls Pro a try instead. We’ve yet to do a video walkthrough on that particular app, but one should be coming soon.
* Again, MusicGestures is a free tweak, and you can find it on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It plays nice with both iOS 4 and iOS 5, so pretty much everyone can join in on the fun.
* What do you think?
