* Over the past few years, cable channels have really jumped on the on-demand bandwagon and now offer premium content available on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. If you have a cable subscription, the entertainment-viewing world is your oyster.
* I am one of those people who has “cut the cord” of cable television. Actually, I never had the cord in the first place. I’ve just managed to get by on broadcast TV. When the nation went digital, I didn’t even get a converter box for my TV set. I spend most of my media-watching time on Netflix or Hulu Plus on my Apple TV.
* However, there are times when watching television is necessary for me, like when there is an earthquake (which actually happened in Sacramento a few weeks ago) or following the presidential elections. For those times, I go to my iPad or iPhone.
