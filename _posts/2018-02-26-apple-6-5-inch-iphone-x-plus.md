* The 2018 iPhone lineup will include a near-6.5-inch model, reports Bloomberg. The outlet says the handset, which would be the largest ever for Apple, will feature an OLED panel with a resolution of 1242 x 2688.
* With a screen close to 6.5 inches, Apple’s big new handset will be one of the largest mainstream smartphones on the market. While the body of the phone will be about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, the screen will be about an inch larger thanks to the edge-to-edge design used in the iPhone X. (Apple is unlikely to refer to the phone as a phablet, a term popularized by Samsung.)
* The phablet is code named D33, a person familiar with its development says, and at least some prototypes include a screen resolution of 1242 x 2688. That would make the screen about as sharp as the one on the 5.8-inch iPhone X. Apple also plans to use OLED technology, the same, more expensive type of screen in the regular iPhone X.
* The report goes on to say that Apple is also considering bringing its gold colorway to the refreshed iPhone X and its larger sibling, and adding dual SIM capability to the latter. Both are expected to feature stainless steel edges and next-gen A12 processors.
* In addition to the two higher end ‘X’ models, Apple is apparently working on a new lower-cost handset. It will feature a cheaper LCD panel and an aluminum body, but will still have Face ID and an edge-to-edge display.
* Apple typically releases its new iPhones in the early fall, so expect to hear a lot more about these 3 potential models in the coming months.
