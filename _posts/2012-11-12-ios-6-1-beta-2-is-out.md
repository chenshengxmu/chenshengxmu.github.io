* Apple just seeded its registered developers with the second beta of iOS 6.1. The software follows November 1 release of the first iOS 6.1 beta which brought out MapsKit improvements and other tidbits.
* Beta 2 has a build number of 10B5105c versus 10B5095f for Beta 1. Apple says iOS 6 Beta 2 contains bug fixes and improvements over iOS 6.0.1, in addition to tweaks like a new information card in the Passbook app.
* A new beta of the Apple TV software is also available. The new iOS 6.1 beta is available for the various iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Apple TV devices. Apple’s registered developers can download them via the company’s developer portal.
* The iPhone maker also released Xcode 4.6 Developer Preview 2 today (build 4H95e), its preferred development environment for third-parties that write Mac and iOS apps. Your release notes and additional info are right below…
* And in response to user feedback, Apple added  a new Passbook information card which explains what the software is capable of. Previously, launching Passbook was confusing because the app lacks sample cards or any viable explanation revealing its purpose.
* The new information card in the Passbook app was first noted by RazorianFly.

* The card’s appearance is substantially different to the information screen that used to greet users on first run.
* The Panorama mode in the Camera app now works again and users – fortunately – are again able to download individual songs from iTunes Match (in Beta 1, you could only download whole albums).
* Registered Apple developers can download an appropriate build of the new iOS and Apple TV software for their devices throught the Apple Developer web site. The second iOS 6.1 Beta build is compatible with the second, third and fourth-generation iPad, iPad mini, iPhone 3GS/4/4S/5 plus fourth and fifth-gen iPod touch.
* Existing devices with iOS 6.1 Beta 1 can also upgraded to today’s software over-the-air, by choosing General > Software Update in the Settings app.
* iPhone 5 owners can determine the proper download for their device here.
* Today’s build expires on Friday, December 28.
* Today’s iOS 6.1 beta 2 (10B105c) released to developers expires on Friday December 28, 2012 @ 12AM (GMT). #TheMoreYouKnow

* Known Issues
* In iOS 6.1 beta 1, you will not be able to upgrade or downgrade your iCloud storage (5 GB is free). As a workaround, please use either the latest OS X or a device running iOS 6.0.
* Notes
* In iOS 6.1, the Map Kit framework introduces the MKLocalSearch, MKLocalSearchRequest, and MKLocalSearchResponse classes. Apps can use these classes to perform map-based searches for addresses and points of interest. The results are then delivered to the app as an array of map item objects. For information about these new classes, see Map Kit Framework Reference.
* Known Issues
* None.
* Notes
* As of iOS 6.1, the relevance behavior has changed for boarding passes that include both a relevant date and a relevant location. The date must match for these passes to be relevant. If both the date and location match, they are relevant for a longer window of time. You are encouraged to provide both pieces of information when they make sense for your passes
* Known Issues
* None.
* Notes
* In iOS 6.1, a new Reset Advertising Identifier button has been added to Advertising Settings. This button resets the Advertising Identifier so that future requests will return a different value.
* Known Issues
* None.
* Notes
* This release does not support testing In-App Purchase in iOS Simulator. For apps that use this feature, please test on a device.
* Known Issues
* None.
* Notes
* Weibo shows up in the Settings app only if a Chinese keyboard is enabled.
* When using the iOS 6.1 SDK on OS X v10.8 (Mountain Lion), if you use the iOS 5.0 or iOS 5.1 “Legacy SDK” in iOS Simulator, you will not be able to sign in to Twitter via the Settings pane and Twitter.frameworkwill not work correctly. If you need to test Twitter features, you will need to choose either the iOS 6.1 or iOS 6.0 Simulator run destination or test with iOS 5.x on a device. These problems do not occur when running Simulator on OS X v10.7 (Lion).
* Known Issues
* None.
