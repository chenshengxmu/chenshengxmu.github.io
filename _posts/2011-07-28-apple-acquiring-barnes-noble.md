* BGR has reported that an unproven source has knowledge that Apple has had recent discussions of purchasing Barnes & Noble. This might seem odd at first, but it would be a good move. Apple would be able to use Barnes & Noble’s expansive collection of eBooks for their iBooks store.
* Apple has $76.2 billion in the bank, so acquiring Barnes & Noble wouldn’t hurt financially. If Apple were to acquire the book retailer, it could cost them anywhere from $1-1.5 billion. Also, Apple could convert a good amount of Barnes & Noble locations to Apple Stores, or an Apple section could be added to each store.
* It will be interesting to see if Apple really does purchase Barnes and Noble, especially after being in talks to acquire Hulu.
* Do you think Apple is going to acquire Barnes and Noble? Does it make sense for them to do so?
