* One of the prime reasons why Apple-sanctioned Lightning accessories, cables and adapters have been so pricey are high costs and allegedly exorbitant fees attached to the company’s ‘Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod’ (MFi) program. Established in 2005, the MFi initiative requires third-parties to use Apple-approved authentication chips and certified cables and adhere to Apple’s rigorous testing.
* All of the products that pass testing bear an Apple-approved ‘Made for iPod/iPhone/iPad’ label. By lowering the program fees, Apple has enabled vendors to produce cheaper Lightning cables, adapters and other accessories for the iPhone and iPad…
* The Japanese blog Macotakara reported Friday that the licensing costs reduction not only applies to Lightning cables, but to other MFi accessories as well.
* Though the exact amount of the cost reduction was unknown at press time, Macotakara suggested it should pave the way to more affordable accessories.
* As these changes take time to trickle down to all of the suppliers and vendors, the effects in the form of cheaper accessories should be expected in the coming weeks.
* AppleInsider says that MFi originally used to charge fees “rumored to have been in the realm of $10 per device, or 10 percent of the total retail cost of the accessory — whichever was greater,” though the fees got reduced over the years.
* High royalties are also said to plague MFi iOS game controllers.
* After initially launching their respective game controllers at $100 only to see them universally panned as overpriced, both Logitech and Stratus slashed their price points in an effort to revitalize sluggish sales.
