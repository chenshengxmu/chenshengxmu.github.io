* A spark of good news seems to be circulating in the jailbreak community this week after an iOS 11.2.x-based kernel exploit became publicized.
* And if that news wasn’t good enough in and of itself, a Tweet shared by renowned iOS developer and Electra jailbreak tool creator CoolStar underscores interest in toying around with it:

* The Tweet isn’t a guarantee that CoolStar will implement an iOS 11.2.x jailbreak based on the new exploit, but rather a word of enlightenment that it could be possible. At this point in time, it’s too early to tell what could materialize after everything is said and done.
* Given the current circumstances, we’d recommend that any avid jailbreakers using iOS 11.2-11.2.6 stay put and avoid upgrading their firmware. It seems that CoolStar agrees with this logic:

* iOS 11.3 and later don’t appear to be vulnerable to the exploit mentioned above, so upgrading would be counterproductive should you possess an ounce of interest in jailbreaking iOS 11.2.x.
* As of this writing, Saurik has yet to update Cydia or Mobile Substrate with official support for iOS 11, but CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 bundles a modified version of Cydia and a Substrate substitute that appear to work just as well. Any future jailbreak from CoolStar, should it surface, would likely bundle similar utilities.
* Would you be interested in a jailbreak for iOS 11.2.x? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.
