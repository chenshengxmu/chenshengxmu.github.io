* CCSwipe is a recently released tweak that replaces the standard Control Center swipe gesture with a gesture that invokes the App Switcher, and a gesture that takes you to the Home screen.
* By itself, CCSwipe isn’t mind-blowing, but its preference panel contains an innovative features that I feel is worth some praise. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside to see what it I mean.
* After installing CCSwipe, you should open the stock Settings app and find the tweak’s preferences. Inside of the preferences, you’ll find two settings: a slider for adjusting the Control Center swipe zone, and a switch for inverting the actions of the zones.
* The swipe zone slider features two nubs, with a full range of 320 points, thus, adjusting one of the nubs to 160 would be exactly half of the slider’s interface area.
* Swipes performed within the swipe zone area, between the two nubs, results in a normal opening of Control Center. Swipes performed outside of the swipe zone on the left side results in a go to Home screen action. And finally, swipes performed outside of the swipe zone on the right side results in an App Switcher action.
* With this in mind, it’s thus possible to have three zones—one for going to the Home screen, one for invoking Control Center, and one for invoking the App Switcher. Or, you can have two zones if you give each zone the same amount of area. Changes performed to the swipe zones seem to be effective immediately, though, there is a respring button located in the upper left-hand corner of the tweak’s preferences just in case.
* With all of this in mind CCSwipe is an extremely simple tweak in practice, but the presence of the swipe zone feature is great. Even if you decide that CCSwipe isn’t your cup of tea, if you can, I advise you to play around with it to at least check out the swipe zone feature. It’s an interesting concept that I hope more tweaks use in the future.
* One thing I don’t like about CCSwipe is that if you use the Home screen gesture while on the Home screen, it locks your device. I wish this feature could be toggled via the preferences, because it’s super-annoying to inadvertently lock your device with a swipe gesture.
* What do you think about CCSwipe? It’s free of charge on the BigBoss repo. Drop us a line with your thoughts down below in the comment section.
