* Still wondering about those unlocked iPhones that clocked much faster data speeds on T-Mobile’s network at WWDC’s Moscone West building in San Francisco? Well, Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier, the nation’s fourth-largest, today shared some interesting updates concerning “4G” rollout,  which includes the iPhone-friendly 1900MHz band on its HSPA+ network…
* Senior vice president of technology Dave Mayo took to the official blog to detail progress his company’s been making on this front.
* By the end of this month, some four hundred modernized cell sites supporting HSPA+ on the 1900MHz band will light up, growing to 2,500 sites by the end of July.
* We’ve also secured zoning approval or do not require zoning for over 19,500 sites and have completed necessary entitlement work, including obtaining building permits for over 4,000 sites.
* The modernization will also improve existing voice and data coverage while enabling iPhone compatibility, Mayo wrote.
* As new equipment is in place, we’re turning up some small scale tests of 4G HSPA+ service in our 1900 MHz spectrum.
* Some customers with unlocked iPhones recently saw evidence of those tests; clocking much faster data speeds at the Moscone West conference center in San Francisco.
* More of these speed sightings will occur as we work toward introducing 4G HSPA+ service in our 1900 MHz spectrum in a large number of markets later this year.
* The carrier confirmed last month that the iPhone-friendly HSPA+ is coming later this year. As work continues on network upgrades and the Apple deal, T-Mobile is having a blast poking fun of the iPhone in its print and television advertising, though the company obviously benefits from the more than a million unlocked iPhones on its network.
* By the way, why is T-Mobile still fooling average people with its 4G marketing bullshit?
* From Wikipedia:
* In telecommunications, 4G is the fourth generation of cell phone mobile communications standards. It is a successor of the third generation (3G) standards.
* So, no T-Mobile, your HSPA+ network is not “4G”.
* It’s still 3G, no matter how zippy HSPA+ is.
* And as far as true 4G is concerned, T-Mobile won’t begin deploying LTE before 2013, Mayo confirmed.
* So cut the crap already, will you?
* Apple got slammed for this in Australia, so how come nobody is suing carriers for misleading people with false and stupendous 4G advertising?
* That they’re able to get away with it is seriously ticking me off…
