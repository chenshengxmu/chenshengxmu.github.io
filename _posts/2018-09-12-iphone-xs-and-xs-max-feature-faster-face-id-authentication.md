* At Apple’s September 12th event, the Cupertino-based company unveiled its new iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max handsets with a bevy of hardware upgrades from their predecessor, the iPhone X.
* One of the significant leaps comes by way of faster and more secure Face ID authentication, the process of which has been sped up with improved algorithms and a zippier secure enclave.
* While Face ID has quickly become Apple’s new standard for authentication, superseding Touch ID on the company’s flagship handsets, that hasn’t kept it from performing rather slowly and unreliably in specific situations.
* With the new hardware, you can expect a more reliable experience in real-life situations, including indoor and outdoor use. And best of all, you won’t have to bow to your iPhone Xs or iPhone Xs Max as long as you may have been compelled to in the case of the iPhone X.
