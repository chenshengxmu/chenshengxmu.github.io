* Reuters is out with a new report this afternoon regarding the iWatch. Citing sources familiar with the project, the outlet says that Apple’s long-rumored smartwatch is set to go into mass production next month at Taiwan’s Quanta Computer Inc, ahead of a likely October launch.
* The report also offers up some details about the so-called iWatch—most of which we’ve heard rumored before—including that the device will feature a 2.5-inch display and wireless charging capabilities, and will have a built-in sensor that’ll be capable of monitoring a user’s pulse…
* Here’s more from Reuters’ Michael Gold:
* Apple will introduce a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular, one of the sources said. The source added that the watch face will protrude slightly from the band, creating an arched shape, and will feature a touch interface and wireless charging capabilities.
* The source said Apple expects to ship 50 million units within the first year of the product’s release, although these types of initial estimates can be subject to change. The watch is currently in trial production at Quanta, which will be the main manufacturer, accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly, the source said.
* While the watch is widely expected, the start date of its mass production and the extent of Quanta’s involvement were not known until now. Mass production will start in July and the commercial launch will come as early as October, according to the source and another person familiar with the matter. 
* Again, several of the details in Gold’s report match up with previous chatter, but the description varies a bit. We’re not sure if the device is going to be round, curved—or if it’s even going to look like a watch at all. Some have speculated that it could look more like a Nike FuelBand.
* It’s also interesting that the Reuters report lists the pulse reader as the only built-in sensor, as we’ve heard that the watch will feature multiple sensors for tracking various health and fitness data. Apple has spent the last 2 years hiring experts from various fitness and medical fields.
* But tiny details aside, it certainly sounds like Apple is working on a wearable and plans to launch it in or around October. The company is also said to be working on not one, but two new smartphones with larger displays, refreshed iPad Air and mini tablets and a new Apple TV.
