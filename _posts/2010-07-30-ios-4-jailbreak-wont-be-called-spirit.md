title: iOS 4 Jailbreak Won't Be Called Spirit
---
* We’ve all been waiting for a while for the new jailbreak for iOS 4 and it sure seems we are on the right track. I know many of you are very anxious for the tool to be released but I’m not. I really want my jailbreak back too but I want it stable and bug free, which is why it hasn’t been released yet.

* We’ve all been thinking the new jailbreak will just be an update to Spirit, and we all assumed the name of the tool would be Spirit 2 or something along these lines. Today a little bird tells me the new jailbreak for iOS 4 and iPhone 4 will not be called Spirit.
* Now don’t ask me what it’s going to be because I don’t know. iPhone hacker iH8Sn0w joked that the new jailbreak would include “pie” in its name but this is not true.
* Just for the fun of it, what do you think it should be called? Sn0wSt0rm? Blu3Thund3r? UltraDr1zzle?
