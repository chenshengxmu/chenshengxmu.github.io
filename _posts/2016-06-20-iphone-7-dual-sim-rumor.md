* Apple’s next-generation handset may include dual-SIM trays allowing it to be used with multiple carriers more easily, if photos of alleged iPhone 7 components posted on Chinese microblogging service Weibo are anything to go by.
* The ability to use two SIM cards at the same time, a first for iPhone, would let users send and receive cellular phone calls and text messages from two phone numbers, via two carriers. The iPhone 7 may also keep the headphone jack and include a 256-gigabyte model, a leakster said.
* Photo below: other claimed iPhone 7 components, including the 4.7-inch iPhone 7’s Lightning cable assembly which still has a headphone jack attached to it. Prior rumors indicated that Apple would be ditching more than a century-old analog audio jack in favor of wired Lightning headphones and Bluetooth.

* Other parts seen on the photos include some display panels in 4.7 and 5.5-inch sizes, 256GB SanDisk memory chips and a dual-lens camera module that should be headed to the flagship 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model.
* These photos were obtained from Chinese smartphone repair shop, Rock Fix .
* “The shop owner also told us that there will be some changes to the antenna design, though he clarified that this won’t get rid of those antenna bands on the back of the phone,” reads the article.
* What do you guys make of this?
