* Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has joined the Board of Directors of investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. The appointment brings the Goldman Sachs board to thirteen directors, ten of whom are independent.
* According to a newly published webpage over at Goldman Sachs, Oppenheimer will be a member of each of the firm’s Audit, Risk, Compensation and Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public Responsibilities committees.
* “Peter’s 25 years of broad experience across important industries will add a valuable perspective to our Board of Directors,” said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO in a prepared statement. “We appreciate his willingness to serve as a director and look forward to benefitting from his judgment and counsel”…
* His profile over at Goldman Sachs reads:
* Through his positions as CFO and Controller at Apple and Divisional CFO at ADP, Mr. Oppenheimer has significant experience in the preparation and review of financial statements as well as capital and risk management.
* He also brings to our Board experience in the oversight of technology and technology risks, which he has developed in connection with, among other things, his oversight of information systems at Apple. Through his service on the boards of directors of not-for profit entities and as CFO at Apple, Mr. Oppenheimer has developed experience in corporate governance and leadership.
* As Apple’s CFO, Oppenheimer manages the controller, treasury, investor relations, tax, information systems, internal audit, facilities, corporate development and human resources functions, reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook.
* He also serves on Apple’s executive committee.
* According to his Apple bio page, the executive received his Bachelor’s degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in Agricultural Business and an M.B.A. from Santa Clara University, both with honors.
* He is also a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.
* Oppenheimer joined Apple in 1996 as controller for the Americas. A year later, he became vice president and Worldwide Sales controller and then a corporate controller.
* Prior to joining Apple, he was Chief Financial Officer of the Claims Services Division for Automatic Data Processing. And before that gig, Oppenheimer had spent six years in the Information Technology Consulting Practice with Coopers and Lybrand, where he managed financial and systems engagements for clients in the insurance, telecommunications, transportation and banking industries.
