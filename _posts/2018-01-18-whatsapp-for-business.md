* The WhatsApp messaging platform appears to be inching closer to a viable revenue plan with all-new accounts for businesses available starting today via the new WhatsApp Business app.
* According to the company, the app is currently available to Android users in Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the UK and the US, but they’ll be rolling it out around the world in the coming weeks.
* They’ll eventually have a version for iPhones as well.
* The free software includes handy tools to help small businesses connect and chat with their customers. Users who choose to engage with businesses this way can continue using the regular WhatsApp without downloading anything new.
* Users have full control over the messages they receive from brands: they can block a business number like they would any other number, as well as report spam.
* Businesses can set an away message to let users know when to expect a response, create canned responses, record a greeting message to introduce their business to users and more.
* Key highlights of the WhatsApp Business app include:
* “This is just the beginning,” the firm said.
* WhatsApp intends to charge businesses in some form in the future. The service has no source of revenue after it dropped an annual subscription ($1 per year) in 2016. Both WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have ruled out advertising on WhatsApp.
* Facebook is obviously attempting to leverage its services and customer base to monetize WhatsApp. Earlier, the company started injecting ads into Messenger and Instagram. They’re also testing the ability for users to cross-post their Instagram Stories to WhatsApp.
