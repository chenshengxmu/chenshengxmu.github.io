* The iPhone is widely expected to get a major upgrade this fall. Not only is the handset’s current form factor more than two years old, but the competition is really heating up with handsets like Samsung’s Galaxy S III.
* Some of the upcoming smartphone’s rumored features include a larger, 4-inch display, a redesigned casing, and LTE compatibility. But what about the processor? According to a new report, it’s going to be quad-core…
* Citing “industry sources,” the somewhat-reliable DigiTimes reports:
* “Additionally, Apple is also expected to release its next-generation iPhone built on Samsung’s Exynos 4 quad-core processor in the second half, heating up competition in the segment, commented the sources.”
* The iPad 3 uses the A5X processor, which Apple touts as a quad-core chip. But it actually only has a dual-core CPU. Samsung’s Exynos 4, however, is actually a quad-core processor — the same one Samsung uses in its Galaxy S III.
* Considering the size of the upgrade, it’s possible that the new processor could come with the long-awaited ‘A6’ badge, a chip that Apple has been rumored to be working on for quite some time.
* Of course, we don’t have to tell you how sketchy DigiTimes’ reporting can be. So this is all still speculation at this point. But we wouldn’t be surprised to see a quad-core processor turn up this fall.
* With good-looking offerings coming out of both Microsoft and Google this fall, Apple certainly has some high expectations to live up to with its next iPhone.
