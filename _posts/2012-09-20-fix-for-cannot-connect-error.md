* Since updating my iPhone to the latest iOS version available, I’ve been having problems with the App Store. Specifically, when I was in the Passbook application and clicked the App Store portal, I was met with the following error: “Cannot connect to iTunes Store.”
* As it turns out, I’m not the only one having this problem. A thread has started in Apple’s support forums regarding the issue, and it has already garnered 5,000 views. Luckily, it appears that some folks have managed to come up with a fix.
* The solution is pretty simple, as long as you know about it:
* Step 1: Go to Settings > General > Date and Time > Set Automatically > Off.
* Step 2: Set the date one year ahead.
* Step 3: Go back to the App Store and try to download or update an app.
* Step 4: If you’re still getting the “cannot connect to iTunes or App Store” error message, go back to Settings > General > Date and Time > Set Automatically back to On. Now go back and try again. It should fix your issue.
* Believe or not, this worked. Now when I tap the App Store link from within the Passbook application, it opens to the Passbook section. This is especially nice, since at the moment, there isn’t a way to visit the Passbook section any other way.
* Did this work for you? Let us know in the comments below!
