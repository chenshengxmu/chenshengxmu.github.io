* A United States International Trade Commission (ITC) judge ruled Tuesday that Apple’s iconic iPhone did not infringe upon any of the patents owned by Google’s subsidiary Motorola Mobility.
* A spokesperson for Motorola said to the press that “we’re disappointed with this outcome and are evaluating our options”.
* Apple wouldn’t comment but club Cupertino must be joyful with the outcome, especially knowing Google spent $12.5 billion just to get hold of Motorola’s patent trove…
* Bloomberg has the story:
* Apple’s iPhone didn’t violate patent rights owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility for a sensor that prevents accidental hang-ups, a U.S. International Trade Commission judge said today.
* ITC judge Thomas Pender said in a notice posted on the agency’s docket that Motorola’s patent involving the phone’s proximity sensor is invalid.
* Pender’s findings are subject to review by the full commission. His full determination will become public after both sides get a chance to redact confidential information, Bloomberg notes.
* It’s Pender’s second ruling favoring Apple after Motorola asserted patent infringement. Back in August, the judge cleared Apple of Motorola’s claims concerning 3G cellular radio technology.
* The encouraging development comes hot on the heels off today’s news that Samsung dropped its bid to ban Apple products in Europe after a judge over in the United States threw its juror misconduct claims.
