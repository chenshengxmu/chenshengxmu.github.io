* It’s hard to believe that there was once a time when iPhone owners had to do without folders. To make matters worse, iPad owners are just recently reaping the benefits of folders.
* Prior to this revelation in organization, our apps were scattered across screen upon screen, making it extremely difficult to find a specific app quickly.
* If you’re new to the iPhone, or just need a brief refresher course, this iPhone Basics tutorial will explain how to use and manage your folders properly…
* In a nutshell, folders allow you to better manage your cache of apps. Using them helps you to avoid having page after page of app icons littering your Home screen.
* Remember, that folders have a 12 app limit, so keep that in mind when it comes to organizing your apps. There are workarounds to the 12 app limit, but they all require your iPhone to be jailbroken, which is beyond the scope of this iPhone Basics tutorial.
