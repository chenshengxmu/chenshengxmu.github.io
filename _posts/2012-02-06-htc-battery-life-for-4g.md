title: HTC Says Sacrificing Size and Battery Life for LTE Was a Big Mistake

* Apple has received a lot of criticism for leaving LTE out of its two latest iOS devices. After all, Android manufacturers have been implementing the 4G technology in handsets and tablets for over a year now.
* But as Tim Cook noted last Summer, LTE chipsets have been too big and too battery-intensive thus far for Apple to justify using them in its devices. And it looks like HTC had to find that out the hard way…
* We told you earlier about HTC’s 26% profit drop last quarter. The company cited heavy competition from both Apple and Samsung as a big reason for the decline, but CFO Winston Yung also believes that HTC’s own products were a factor.
* Electronista reports:
* “HTC during a call discussing its low forecast and results backtracked from the strategy that dictated 2011. CFO Winston Yung acknowledged a lukewarm reception for fall devices but added that the company’s philosophy throughout all of last year, where it was willing to make thick, short-lived devices for the sake of having 4G, was a mistake. The “next product cycle” of devices would fix this, Yung said.”
* As the site points out, this kind of indirectly validates Apple’s decision to hold off on LTE technology up to this point.
* That being said, the company is rumored [again] to be finally launching LTE-capable products this year. And if the gossip materializes, it’ll be interesting to see how it implements the 4G tech without sacrificing device size and battery life.
