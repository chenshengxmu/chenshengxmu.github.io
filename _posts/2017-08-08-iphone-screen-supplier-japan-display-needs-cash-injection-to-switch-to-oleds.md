* Apple supplier Japan Display is considering seeking a possible capital injection from strategic investors and buyout funds to help finance a shift from its ailing LCD smartphone business to OLED technology, widely believed to be adopted by Apple’s premium iPhone 8 model.
* “The company has been hurt by its late entry into organic light-emitting diode screens (OLED) and fluctuating demand for Apple’s iPhones,” reads the report. A source said Japan Display was also seeking 100 billion yen last month from its main creditors to help pay for restructuring.
* According to a Nikkei business daily report Tuesday, cited by Reuters, the company is even considering axing 3,500 jobs in an effort to consolidate operations.
* Last year, Japan Display received 75 billion yen, which works out to approximately $677 million, from the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ). Japan Display was formed five years ago from the ailing display-making units of Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba.
