* This year’s iPhones may ship with an 18W power adapter and USB-C to Lightning cables.
* If true, customers who buy one of the upcoming iPhone models this year will be able to take advantage of the fast-charge feature right out of the box. That’s according to a post on Chinese social network Weibo that cites supply chain sources, which MacRumors highlighted today.
* ROUNDUP: The best power adapters to fast-charge your iPhone
* The iPhone 8 and iPhone X models officially support the fast-charge feature that uses the USB Power Delivery specification to charge the battery from 0-50 percent in 30 minutes.

* Older iPhones support fast charge-like capability that allows them to charge faster via Apple’s 10W or 12W adapter for iPad. Apple on its website maintains a list of third-party USB-C chargers that support the fast-charge feature on the latest iPhones and 2017 iPad Pros.
* ROUNDUP: Best USB-C power packs that support Power Delivery
* If you have Apple’s regular 5W brick, but would like to jump on the fast-charge bandwagon, that’ll be at least $74 to get yourself a 29W USB‑C Power Adapter as the least expensive Apple option and a Lightning to USB-C cable, which is currently sold and built exclusively by Apple.
* What do you make of this rumor?
