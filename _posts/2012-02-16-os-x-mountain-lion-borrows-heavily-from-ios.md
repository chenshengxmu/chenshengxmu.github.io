* Today Apple took the wraps off of OS X Mountain Lion (I know, we should have saw that one coming) and continuing with the movement started with its predecessor, OS X Lion, it borrows heavily from iOS.
* In fact, you could say that OS X Lion’s iOS implants were rather mild compared to what Mountain Lion plans to offer. Apple is obviously serious about completely combining the best elements of iOS directly into its desktop operating system, and no where is this more evident than with Mountain Lion.
* Like times past, Apple has released a video teaser outlining various components of their upcoming OS X update. You’re already aware of one of them — iMessage — but what are the others?
* The common thread for all of these iOS features is iCloud. Apple will harness iCloud to seamlessly sync each of the aforementioned features together across iPads, iPhone, iPod touches, and now, Macs. Without iCloud, these would amount to nothing more than disjointed copies from iOS. Now there’s a real, and I hate to use the term, but there’s a real “synergy” here.
* What do you think about Apple’s continuing initiative to integrate iOS into its desktop operating system? Do you think this is a good thing, or do you believe that the two should remain evidently separate?
