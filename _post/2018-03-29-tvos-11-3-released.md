* Aside from dropping iOS 11.3, Apple today also released tvOS 11.3 for Apple TV.
* You can grab the update from iDownloadBlog’s Download page.
* The software update can be installed over the air in Settings → System → Software Updates → Update Software. tvOS 11.3 is available for the fourth-generation model and Apple TV 4K.
* Check out the tvOS 11.3 release notes for the full breakdown of everything new and improved in tvOS 11.3 and detailed information regarding the security content of this software update.
* As evidenced earlier this morning by the leaked release notes, AirPlay 2 is not part of this tvOS releases after all. Moreover, there aren’t many new features in this edition of tvOS.
* In fact, it seems that tvOS 11.3 introduces performance improvements and focuses on bug fixes for the issues discovered following the release of tvOS 11.2.6.
