* Apple is taking iPhone 5 pre-orders starting 12:01am Pacific, 3am Eastern on September 14. That’s tomorrow and less than 24 hours from now. In addition to the online Apple Store, carriers Sprint, AT&T and Verizon have confirmed they will be taking pre-orders for the phone at the same time.
* Several regional U.S. carriers also announced availability and retailer Walmart said it will be taking pre-orders at its U.S. stores starting at 8am, priced at $189.97 with a two-year AT&T, Verizon or Sprint contract.
* With plenty of options for those who are planning on upgrading, I’m wondering if you prefer pre-ordering or standing in line for this year’s iPhone…
* At any rate, if you’re gonna pay full price for your iPhone 5, keep tabs on what regional U.S. carriers are offering in your area. We know that Cricket, C Spire, GCI and Appalachian Wireless will all be landing the iPhone 5 on September 28.
* If you’re going prepaid and off-contract, Cricket and Virgin are worth checking out.
* With that in mind, cast your vote right now.
* The iPhone 5: will you pre-order or stand in line I’m guessing you’ll wanna pre-order the iPhone 5 without losing your unlimited data plan? Gizmodo has a handy guide on that.
* Perhaps you’ll be jumping ship just to get the new iPhone? 148apps has you covered.
* Pre-ordering online? Cult of Mac news editor John Brownlee has a bunch of useful tips on that, plus some carrier-specific advice.
* Speaking of carriers, Ina Fried of AllThingsD wrote a nice roundup of some important fine print they ain’t telling you about.
* Don’t want to wait in line for the iPhone 5? TaskRabbit will do it for you.
* Speaking of standing in line, remember this?
* Feel free to join the discussion with other fellow iDB readers down in the comments.
* As for me, I’m most concerned about whether we’ll be able to pre-order the iPhone 5 off-contract and unlocked from day one.
* If last year is an indication, Apple will push us into lengthy contracts by refusing to release the unlocked iPhone 5 on the online Apple store until 2013.
* Also, if you’re a true fanboy – that is, the type who upgrades every year as I do – you’ll wanna avoid committing your soul to those nasty carriers for another two years.
