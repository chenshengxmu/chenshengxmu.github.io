* Alongside the launch of the new Gmail, Google today released a Tasks app for iPhone.
* Previously only available via the web interface, the minimalist Tasks app includes features designed to help you manage, capture and edit your tasks from anywhere. Your to-dos synchronize seamlessly across all your devices via your Google account.
* You can nest your tasks, assign due dates, associate them with email and more.
* In the overhauled Gmail app on the web that began rolling out this morning, you can drag emails over to the Tasks section to quickly create a new to-do item based on that email.
* Here are some of the best features of the app:
* Quickly capture tasks anywhere
* Add details and create subtasks
* View tasks created from emails
* Stay on track with due dates and notifications
* This app is now part of G Suite as well.
* As mentioned, integrations with Gmail and Google Calendar help you get tasks done faster.
* Google Tasks is a free download from App Store.
