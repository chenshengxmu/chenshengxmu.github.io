* Sprint has been grabbing some major headlines lately. Most of it has been due to the evidence mounting over the past month or so suggesting that the wireless carrier has finally reached an agreement with Apple Inc. regarding its popular smartphone.
* But according to 9to5Mac, the iPhone isn’t the only Apple-flavored product that the operator will be offering up this Fall. Apparently, Sprint subscribers will also be able to purchase an iPad with the carrier’s data service built-in…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman gets the scoop:
* “Apple and Sprint have completed work on a version of the iPad for Sprint’s data network. This Sprint compatible iPad appears to be ready for public consumption and will join the family of GSM (AT&T) and Verizon capable Apple tablets before the holidays. “
* The source also goes on to confirm an October 7th release date for the iPhone 5. Most analysts and tech pundits seem to agree on an early October availability, save for a recent TUAW article which claimed Sprint might not see the new iPhone until 2012.
* What’s even more interesting is the fact that 9to5Mac’s tipster doesn’t rule out the possibility of the iPad being 4G capable. However, Sprint’s current 4G technology is of the WiMAX variety, which no one else uses.
* Apple mass produces tablets on an enormous scale, so it doesn’t seem likely that it would make a standalone WiMAX version. On the other hand, the aforementioned TUAW article did say something about a Sprint-branded 4G iPad. I guess it’s possible.
* 4G or not, Sprint is one of the last of the major U.S. carriers to offer unlimited data plans. That aspect alone might help Apple’s tablet do well, especially during holiday season. All I know is that if I’m an analyst, I’m raising my iPad sales projections.
* Would you purchase an iPad from Sprint for the unlimited plan? What about if it was 4G?
