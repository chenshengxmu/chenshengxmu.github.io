* Instant Hotspot is a great new feature that allows you to connect to your iPhone’s Hotspot for instant Internet access with zero configuration. As long as your Mac running OS X Yosemite and iPhone running iOS 8 are connected to the same iCloud account, and both devices have Bluetooth enabled, you can quickly tap into your iPhone’s Internet connection from your Mac.
* To make an Instant Hotspot connection, click the Wi-Fi icon in OS X’s menu bar, and click your iPhone under the Personal Hotspot heading. Along with your iPhone’s name, its battery life and cellular signal strength will be displayed.
* As long as both devices are logged in to the same iCloud account, and Personal Hotspot is enabled on your iPhone, your Mac will be able to see and connect to your iPhone at any time. This is a wonderful feature for those of you who routinely work away from the office, or for those of you who often experience flaky Internet connections.
* What are your thoughts on Instant Hotspot? Is this a feature you plan on taking advantage of on a regular basis?
