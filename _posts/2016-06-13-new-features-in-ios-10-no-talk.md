* In typical fashion, Apple used a portion of its WWDC keynote to go over some of the major—or “tentpole”—features coming in the next version of iOS 10. There’s a more powerful Messages app, a new HomeKit app, redesigned Music and News apps, and more.
* But obvioulsy Apple couldn’t cover every new feature today, so it offered up a sneak peak at some other additions and improvements we can expect from the update. The slide you see above names 30+ new features coming in iOS 10, and we’ve listed them below.
* Be sure to stay tuned to iDB for more iOS 10 coverage!
