* Tumblr for iPhone was updated this morning on the App Store with a much appreciated GIF-captioning feature which helps turn the popular micro-blogging software into an instant meme generator.
* In addition to the ability to post regular GIF images and animated GIFs, now both static and animated GIFs can include funny captions with support for up to three built-in fonts and custom colors.
* “Now you can add text to your GIFs,” read release notes accompanying the download. “With three fun and sporty fonts, and a rainbow of color options, you’re guaranteed to find something for every GIF.”
* To get started, select the GIF option when creating a new post and then capture or select a GIF or animated GIF from your Photos library. On the next screen, tap the new “Aa” icon at the bottom to access the GIF-captioning mode.
* You can then type a caption, choose a color using a slider on the right edge of the screen (just like on Facebook’s mobile app= or tap the “Aa” button to cycle through the three available fonts.
* Lastly, this edition of Tumblr for iPhone includes a handy security feature—which must be manually enabled within in-app settings—to keep all your precious GIFs safe and sound with passcode lock.
* Grab Tumblr for free on the App Store.
