* Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring its Twitter app to Apple TV, reports The New York Times. In a wide-ranging article on Twitter’s live-streaming ambitions, the outlet said the social network could use the app to stream several NFL games this season.
* For those that missed it, earlier this year Twitter beat out Facebook and other tech giants to win the rights to Thursday Night Football broadcasts. The deal is for 10 games, and the company plans to stream them all live for free (supported by ads of course).
* Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, considers streaming a critical component of the company’s focus on “live” experiences, along with Periscope, its app that allows smartphone users to live-stream video.
* To bolster the effort, Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring the Twitter app to Apple TV, which would potentially let millions of Apple TV users watch the streaming N.F.L. games, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.
* The live streaming event play is an interesting one by Twitter, which has struggled with growth and identity problems since it went public in 2013. The company hopes the streams will acts as a “window,” allowing users to get a glimpse at what it has to offer.
* Twitter’s first NFL game will be Thursday, September 15, between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.
