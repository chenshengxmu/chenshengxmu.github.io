* As rumored, Amazon has launched a new streaming music service today, and it’s [unsurprisingly] calling it ‘Prime Music.’ The service features over a million songs and hundreds of pre-made playlists, and it’s free for paying subscribers of Amazon Prime.
* Prime members have unlimited access to the service, and will be able to either play music from one of the aforementioned playlists, or create their own. It’s completely ad-free, and comes with standard affair like mobile clients and offline playback support…

* True to previous reports, the Prime Music catalog appears to only include songs older than 6 months. So when you look at that and the comparatively small size of the catalog, it’s clear that this is not a Spotify or Rdio competitor. But maybe it doesn’t need to be.
* Prime Music joins Amazon’s exclusive Prime club that already includes free next-day shipping and access to a Netflix-like streaming video service. All of this can be had for just $99 per year, and it’s believed that there are currently around 20 million members.

* The iOS client for the service comes in the form of a rebranded Amazon Cloud Player app. It offers a clean UI, and several Prime Music features like the ability to download music for offline listening, and tools for managing your music library and custom playlists.
* You can download the new Amazon Music app from the App Store for free, and it supports both iPhone and iPad. Again, you’ll need a Prime account to use the music service, but Amazon is offering a free 30-day trial via its website for folks who want to check it out.
