* If the awesome ARKit-powered measuring tape hasn’t knocked your socks off, how about PCalc, the best scientific calculator available on App Store, in augmented reality?
* Yes, we’ll be the first to admit that the very idea of an augmented reality calculator is a bit silly because who in their right mind would want to perform complex calculations by interacting with a huge virtual object placed on a tabletop or kitchen floor in their real world?
* Me, that’s who!
* Appropriately enough, the video quotes the line by the character Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum) from the original Jurassic Park film: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should”.
* Without further ado, have a look at an ARKit-powered PCalc.
* This is running completely live and all the buttons do really work.
* I was euphoric when developer James Thompson nonchalantly revealed that you can use both the main calculator and all the mini calculators because they’re all perfectly synchronized.
* It’s amazing that he was able to build this with just a few weeks of learning ARKit!
* By the way, positioning the calculator object vertically with ARKit is finicky and plane detection is a bit on the slow side due to a hack James is using to interact with UIKit inside of SceneKit.
* The best bit: an ARKit-enhanced build of the PCalc app is up on Apple’s TestFlight now!
* Wanna play with it on your iOS 11-enabled iPhone or iPad? Email James at pcalc@dragthing.com and when he adds you, download the build via Apple’s TestFlight app.
* To activate the ARKit mode in the app, go into the settings interface, then tap Help → About.
* You’re welcome.
* PCalc for iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch is $9.99 on App Store.
* PCalc for Mac is $9.99 on Mac App Store.
* PCalc for Apple TV is $1.99 on tvOS App Store.
