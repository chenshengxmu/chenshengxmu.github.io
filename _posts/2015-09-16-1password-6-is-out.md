* AgileBits on Wednesday pushed out a significant update for their 1Password iOS app, bringing the popular password manager to version 6.0. The release includes a number of new features and improvements, including a refreshed design and broader support for iOS 9.
* The new look isn’t a major departure from its predecessor, but it’s instantly noticeable. The developers said that they felt 1Password had become a bit “too monochrome,” so they decided to brighten things up. You’ll also notice new category icons and an improved browser.
* Another major tentpole of 1Password 6 is its support for new iOS 9 features. Folks who have updated to the new firmware will be able to perform Spotlight searches for 1Password items without launching the app, and enjoy Slide Over and Split View on supported iPad models.

* Rounding out version 6.0 is support for landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus, an enhanced companion app for Apple Watch that can be locked using Force Touch, more category options, and an improved password generator with Diceware support for real-word passwords.
* You can find 1Password 6 for both iPhone and iPad, in the App Store for free (with a single $9.99 in-app purchase).
