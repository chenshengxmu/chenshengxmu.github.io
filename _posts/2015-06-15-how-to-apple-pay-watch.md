* Issues adding a credit or debit card to Apple Pay?
* If you’re still experiencing issues adding a credit or debit card to Apple Pay, it’s time to call your bank or credit card issuer directly because they’re “ready to help you with issues when adding credit or debit cards to your iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or Apple Watch,” according to Apple.
* In addition to your bank who will help you resolve your issue, you can also contact AppleCare via email, chat or phone.
* Should I choose Credit or Debit on the terminal?
* In rare instances, paying with Apple Pay in a store may yield a message asking if you’d like to use Credit or Debit on the terminal. Apple recommends choosing Credit “to get the most consistent Apple Pay experience” as choosing Debit might not always work successfully with some older merchant payment terminals and backend systems.
* How secure is Apple Pay?
* Using Apple Pay with your Apple Watch is both convenient and secure because a) you don’t need to have your iPhone with you at all and; and b) Apple doesn’t store rich details of your transactions so merchants can’t tie back information to you.
* Adding a credit or debit card to your Apple Watch creates a unique Device Account Number which gets encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in Apple Watch walled off from the rest of the system.
* Neither Apple nor your device sends your actual credit or debit card numbers to merchants. Only your Device Account Number, along with a transaction-specific dynamic security code, is used to process the payment.
* Merchants only receive information like name, email address, billing and shipping addresses you authorize to share to fulfill your order.
* “Your card number and identity aren’t shared with the merchant, and your actual card numbers aren’t stored on your device or on Apple servers,” explains the company.
* What about rewards from my card when using Apple Pay?
* When you pay using Apple Pay, you will automatically earn any rewards provided by your credit or debit cards. “Just set up your participating cards on Apple Watch, and you’ll continue to get the same rewards, benefits and security,” notes Apple.
