* As promised, ‘Swing Copters,’ the latest game from Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen is now available in the App Store. It’s free, with a single $1.29 in-app purchase to remove ads, and it supports both the iPhone and iPad.
* The premise of the game is actually quite similar to Flappy Bird—navigate your character through obstacles as you scroll through a level. You’re going upward this time, instead of side to side, but you’re still furiously tapping…

* As you can imagine, there’s not much to Swing Copters. The App Store description is literally a single sentence, “flying with a propeller hat is not as easy as it looks,” and a set of dead simple instructions: tap to change direction.
* Like Flappy Bird, the game is both frustrating and addictive. The swinging hammers make it very difficult to zig-zag your way through, but tapping just right, even if just for a moment, gives you a feeling that makes you want more.
* Here’s a clip of the game in action:
* It’ll be interesting to see if Nguyen can capture lightning in a bottle a second time. Of course by now, most of you have heard the story of Flappy Bird, which was earning a reported $50K per day in ad revenue before Nguyen pulled it.
* Once again, folks wanting to check out Swing Copters can find it in the App Store for free.
