* The Weather Channel’s nice iPhone app was updated two months ago with substantial design changes and much-needed iOS 7 styling. Today, it’s the iPad app’s turn to get some way overdue iOS 7 love.
* Now available in the App Store, the new Weather Channel for iPad version 4.0 is now closely aligned to the iOS 7 aesthetic and it shows: from precise typography and flat UI elements to the use of translucency and complete lack of ornamentation to the gorgeous background photos that match your current weather conditions and more…
* As the screenshots used in the article attest, The Weather Channel is now a good citizen in iOS 7 and more than a suitable replacement for Apple’s stock Weather app or Yahoo’s free, beautifully designed Weather software.

* It’s interesting that Apple has removed a middle man and now goes straight for the source for iOS weather data. Instead of continuing to tap Yahoo as its weather data provide – which itself sources data from The Weather Channel – Apple now directly retrievs weather forecast from The Weather Channel.
* Why?
* Well, supplanting Yahoo with The Weather Channel gives Apple much richer data sets to work with, including more weather specificity related to the location of a user, a nine-day forecast (instead of five) along with a weather-conditions summary and more.
* Download The Weather Channel 4.0 for iPad free in the App Store. The iPhone app is available as a separate download and both require iOS 7.0 or later.
