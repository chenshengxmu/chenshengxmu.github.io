* iOS 5 is just around the corner for those of us without developer accounts, and Apple has already begun to approve apps with iOS 5 compatibility in the App Store.
* Camera+ was the first app in the App Store to be updated with iOS 5 compatibility, followed by Mashable and several others. While apps are being updated for compatibility with iOS 5, no apps have been approved that are actually built on iOS 5 code.
* Camera+ was recently updated to version 2.2.3, and iOS 5 is referenced in the release notes.
* “Compatibility with that upcoming OS That Must Not Be Named.”
* Mashable’s app was also quickly updated with “iOS 5 compatibility.” We’re assuming that these compatibility updates are mainly for iCloud support, and there are also new APIs in iOS 5 for developers to access and take advantage of.
* It is fully expected that iOS 5 will launch to the public alongside a new iPhone, as that has always been Apple’s method in the past. With apps already being approved for iOS 5 compatibility in the App Store, a September release date seems to make the most sense for both iOS 5 and the new iPhone(s). iCloud will also be unveiled to the public at Apple’s next media event.
* Let us know if you spot any interesting app updates that relate to iOS 5 compatibility. It will be interesting to see what developers can do with the new iOS 5 code.
