* If you’re into the haptic feedback craze and enjoy feeling the ‘buzz’ in your hand when you perform actions on your iPhone, then you’re going to love a new free jailbreak tweak for called HapticKeyboard by developer Cole Cabral.
* As the name suggests, this tweak enables haptic feedback as you type on your keyboard on your iPhone.
* After installing the tweak, you will feel a light vibration effect coming from your device every time you tap a key on your keyboard. This gives you a simulated hardware keyboard effect, as you would normally feel something when you type on a physical keyboard versus a software one.
* This is a feature that comes standard on various Android phones, and has for years, but has only been available to iPhone users who have jailbroken their handsets to open up a new realm of features outside of Apple’s walled garden.
* The tweak will add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can toggle the feature on or off on demand, but since a respring is necessary to save your settings, a respring button is included in the preferences pane:

* HapticKeyboard appears to work even on devices that don’t have the taptic engine, so even if you have the older vibrator motor in your iPhone, you’ll still feel the vibration effect. It just won’t be as subtle and it definitely won’t be as power efficient.
* I’ve tested the tweak on an iPhone 6 Plus and can confirm that it still provides a very firm vibration with each key press, so if you’re rocking a different iPhone, I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to take advantage of this tweak, taptic engine or not.
* The vibration feels a lot better on a device with the taptic engine, and that’s simply because the taptic engine was built specifically for providing feedback; not only for driving the buzzing behind all of your notifications.
* That just leaves you with one more thing to consider: iOS compatibility. Fortunately, HapticKeyboard works with both iOS 9 and iOS 10, so no matter if you’re using the Pangu or Yalu jailbreak, you can utilize HapticKeyboard.
* HapticKeyboard is available for free in Cydia’s BigBoss repository, so if you’re interested in giving it a try, you can download it on your jailbroken device now. Just keep in mind that only iPhones are supported, as iPads and iPod touches don’t have the hardware required to produce a vibration.
