* In addition to the new 5K iMac, Apple announced an update to its aging Mac mini line today. The new desktop computer has been outfitted with Intel’s 4th-gen Core processor, and now supports PCIe-based flash storage and 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and the faster Thunderbolt 2 ports.
* But the Mac mini has never really been about performance; it’s been about the price. As Apple’s least expensive Mac machine offered, the mini gave more people access to the popular OS X ecosystem. And today, the computer gets even more accessible with a  $100 price drop.
* From Apple’s press release:
* “People love Mac mini. It’s a great first Mac or addition to your home network, and the new Mac mini is a nice upgrade packed into an incredibly compact design,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the latest CPU and graphics, faster Wi-Fi, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, OS X Yosemite, and starting at just $499, the new Mac mini is the best value ever.”
* The new Mac mini begins shipping today in 3 standard models: 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5 with 4GB, Intel HD Graphics 5000 and a 500GB HD starting at $499, 2.6GHz i5 with 8GB, Intel Iris Graphics, 1TB for $699, and 2.8GHZ i5 with 8GB, Intel Iris and a 1TB Fusion Drive for $999.
