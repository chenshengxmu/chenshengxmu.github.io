* Just a quick reminder that Feral recently confirmed that Total War: Warhammer II, the second installment of its epic fantasy strategy series, is coming to macOS and Linux later this year.
* A turn-based strategy and real-time tactics title, Warhammer II was originally developed by Creative Assembly in partnership with Games Workshop and published by Sega.
* The game puts you in command of one of four fantastical races: the Dark Elves, High Elves, Lizardmen or Skaven. Your goal: wage a war of conquest across the vast and fantastical landscapes of the New World to stabilize or disrupt the Great Vortex.
* According to Feral, the engrossing narrative campaign is set across four strikingly distinct continents: tropical Lustria, icy Naggaroth the sophisticated Isle of Ulthuan and the deserts, jungles and savannahs of the sprawling Southlands.
* Check out the announcement trailer.
* Feral explains further:
* On the campaign map, players will engage in turn-based empire building as they manage teeming settlements, recruit vast armies, negotiate alliances and wage war.
* In real-time tactical battles, they will command legendary heroes, spellcasters, dragons and mutated mounts as they execute meticulous battle plans including ambushes, cavalry charges and brutal war machine attacks.
* The game will support Apple’s low-overhead Metal graphics framework for hardware-accelerated graphics, but it’s unclear if it will also work with external GPUs under macOS High Sierra and macOS Mojave like some of Feral’s upcoming macOS ports.
* Warhammer II will combine with the original Warhammer and the planned sequel, Total War: Warhammer III (as well as additional content packs), to create the Mortal Empires campaign which they’re calling “the single largest Total War experience ever.”
* Part of the Total War series, the game is the official sequel to 2016’s Total War: Warhammer which was also brought to macOS and Linux by Feral Interactive.
* Pricing and system requirements will be confirmed closer to release.
* This is great news as Feral continues to bring premium games to the Mac platform. Specifically, they’ll be bringing Lego’s Marvel Super Heroes 2 to macOS this summer and the popular city-building game Tropico to iPad later this year.
