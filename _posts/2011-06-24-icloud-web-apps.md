* Apple has published a transition Q&A that outlines how MobileMe’s services will be dissolved and transitioned into iCloud offerings. As of June 30, 2012, MobileMe will cease to exist, and Gallery, iWeb and iDisk will be discontinued.
* Among other details, Apple has confirmed that iCloud will in fact offer web apps for Mail, Contacts, Calendar and Find My iPhone.

* Apple has been prepping iCloud’s official launch with the iOS 5 beta, including some features that are already available in 4.3 and a recent update to iTunes. Speculation was that Apple would not offer web portals to iCloud services (like the soon-to-be-debunked me.com), but instead focus entirely on app integration in iOS and the OS X.
* That appears to no longer be the case, as most of the iCloud package will be available for access online through a secure login.
* Existing MobileMe content (iDisk, Gallery photos, etc.) must be copied and stored locally on your computer before MobileMe expires next June.
* MobileMe email domains (@me.com) will be transition to iCloud’s backend when the service goes live this Fall. More iCloud storage, besides Apple’s already-available, free 5GB, will be available for purchase. This online storage counts towards services like Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Photo Stream. iTunes Match is a paid service that exists separate of iCloud 5GB+ storage structure.
