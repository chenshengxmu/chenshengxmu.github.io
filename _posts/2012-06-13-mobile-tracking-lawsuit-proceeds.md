* Today’s a particularly bad day for Apple’s legal sharks. Just as we learned that Apple won’t be able to stop June 21 launch of Samsung’s Galaxy S III in the U.S. as it hoped it would, Reuters now reports that Apple also failed to fend off the high-profile iPhone tracking lawsuit. Though a federal judge ruled against Apple, he conspicuously let the likes of Google, AdMarval, AdMob, Flurry and Medialets off the hook…
* As a result, Apple will now have to defend aganist accusations that it allowed advertisers to secretly track the activity of millions of iOS device users.
* Reuters has the story:
* Owners of iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches may pursue claims against Apple under two California consumer protection laws, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said in a decision late Tuesday. Koh oversees nationwide litigation combining 19 lawsuits.
* But the judge threw out claims that Apple violated customers’ privacy rights, and also threw out claims under federal laws addressing computer fraud, wiretaps, and records disclosure.
* Things aren’t looking good.
* Remember the firestorm following a discovery that the iPhone collects location data from users without their consent?
* The plaintiffs in their lawsuit blamed Apple for letting advertisers and analytics companies gather data on users’ addresses, genders, ages, UDIDs and even app usage habits.
* Steve Jobs denied publicly that Apple had ever been tracking down its users. With an iOS firmware update issued subsequently, location tracking became an opt-in feature and location history was limited to seven days.
* Jobs in an alleged email wrote “we don’t track anyone” and later called Android “a probe in your pocket”. Apple also published a detailed Q&A, saying that “Apple is now collecting anonymous traffic data to build a crowd-sourced traffic database with the goal of providing iPhone users an improved traffic service in the next couple of years”.

* Indeed, during the unveiling of Apple’s in-house Maps solution at the WWDC keynote, iOS boss Scott Forstall made a point by saying that traffic incidents and other traffic data in Maps is crowd-sourced in real-time and anonymously gathered from other iOS users.
* Be that as it may, Apple will now have to provide sound arguments in a nationwide litigation combining 19 lawsuits that it did not intentionally design iOS devices to allow third-parties to collect location data without users’ consent.
* Thoughts?
