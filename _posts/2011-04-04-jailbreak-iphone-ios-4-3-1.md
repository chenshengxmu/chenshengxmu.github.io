* After much anticipation, the iOS 4.3.1 jailbreak was released early this morning, but I guess the actual time depends on where you live.
* This is the first untethered jailbreak solution for iOS 4.3.1. There have been other jailbreaks for iOS 4.3.1 but they were tethered and had issues with stability.
* Finally, we have a stable and working iOS 4.3.1 solution; actually we have many solutions, as you’ll see below. Big thanks to @i0n1c for his untether, and the iPhone Dev Team for their hard work at making this a reality…
* If a new method to jailbreak iPhone 4.3.1 is unveiled, we will post it here and in our jailbreak section, but for the time being, RedSn0w is your best bet.
