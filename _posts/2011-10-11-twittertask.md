* iOS 5’s Twitter integration is nice and everything, but it’s not without its shortcomings.
* The biggest shortcoming for Twitter integration in iOS, is the inability to send a tweet from anywhere; without an attachment.
* As it stands now, you have to perform an action such as sending a picture, in order to send out a tweet in iOS. No longer…
* TwitterTask is configured to open a new tweet anytime you open up the multitask window with a double press of the home button.
* It’s currently in beta, but I’d imagine that the developer would throw in some Activator options to allow you to open the tweet window using more varied methods.
* Regardless, TwitterTask looks to be an essential jailbreak tweak once iOS 5 is officially released. According to developer, Qwertyoruiop, TwitterTask is scheduled to drop shortly after iOS 5 is publicly released.
* I’m wholeheartedly looking forward to the ability to tweet from anywhere, and with no attachments at that. What about you?
* Note: Looks like Activator now includes a native tweet option as well, so that sort of nullifies the usefulness of TwitterTask. Thanks to Nagy Konstantin for pointing this out in the comments. iDB readers rock.
