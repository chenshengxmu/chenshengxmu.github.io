* Now that Google Chrome has been out for a while on iOS, it’s a good time to sit back and reevaluate its value. Should you ditch Safari for Chrome? Is Chrome good for jailbreakers? How do you get more out of Chrome?
* Inside we’ll take a look at various ways that you can make your Google Chrome experience more rewarding. Even if you’re not a jailbreaker there are plenty of ways you can still benefit…
* Sure, it doesn’t have accelerated Javascript access, but neither does any other 3rd party browser on iOS. It’s not Safari, but it’s not that slow in real world usage.
* Yeah, that’s a crazy amount of tabs. So many that Google threw in a little surprise when you eclipse 99.
* If your device is jailbroken, you can now download files within Chrome. It’s not pretty, but it’s plenty functional.
* For those of you who despise the way Google implemented refresh functionality into Chrome, this tweak is for you.
* Or, perhaps pull to refresh is more of your speed?
* Don’t forget to make Chrome your default browser…There are multiple ways to do this if jailbroken.
* And contrary to popular belief, you can indeed use bookmarklets in Chrome. Instapaper nuts rejoice.
* For those of you who hate Chrome’s default keyboard layout, this one’s for you. But you’ve been warned, you’ll loose some functionality by doing so.
* Even without jailbreaking, Chrome is a worthy Safari alternative and packs quite a lot of features.
* What do you think? Have you tried Chrome yet, or are you definitely sticking with Safari?
