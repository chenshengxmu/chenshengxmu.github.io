* Last year, Apple broke its three-year tradition of announcing a new iPhone during its WWDC event. The World Wide Developers Conference, which takes place in mid-June, is a major event for the Cupertino company.
* For reasons unknown, Apple didn’t unveil any new hardware at last year’s conference. Instead, consumers had to wait until October to purchase the company’s new handset. But according to a new report, that won’t be the case this year…
* The Commercial Times is reporting that Apple will unveil the iPhone 5 during its WWDC conference this year. Quoting an analyst of Daiwa Securities, the site says that we’ll see a revamped “glass to glass touch panel” handset from Apple this Summer.
* We’re not sure it would make sense for Apple to release a new phone within 9 months of the iPhone 4S launch, but this isn’t the first time we’ve heard this claim. In fact, the word on the street is that Apple has had a working iPhone 5 since the Summer of last year. So a Summer launch this year doesn’t seem that far-fetched.
* The next-generation iPhone is expected to feature Apple’s new A6 quad-core processor, a new hardware design, and LTE compatibility.
