* After refreshing Google Plays Newsstand for iOS yesterday with native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the Internet giant Google on Tuesday pushed an update to another app, its Play Music client for the iPhone and iPad.
* Taking a page from Betas Music’s book, the new version of Google Play Music, available free in the App Store, enables mood or activity based search for radio stations. Jogging? Good, use the ‘Running’ tag to find music that matches your activity. Holding a party? The related ‘Partying’ should come in handy.
* And because this is Google, they even let you search for ‘Feeling Happy’ radio stations. Other new features and enhancements are briefly mentioned right after the break.
* The Listen Now screen has been prettified with better recommendations and the addition of your Recently Played listening history.
* Note that mood/activity based search and the ability to cherry-pick your radio station is available only to paying customers who subscribe to the Google Play Music All Access service, a $9.99 per month value.
* A 30-day free trial is available.
* Google Play Music 1.4.3057 changelog:
* The six-megabyte app requires an iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 7.0 or later. Unfortunately, it continues to lack the native iPad interface.
* [App Store]
