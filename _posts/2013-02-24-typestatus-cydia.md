title: TypeStatus now available on Cydia
---
* TypeStatus — a new jailbreak tweak that we previewed in the wee hours this morning, has gone live on Cydia. This tweak places a handy ellipsis notification in the status bar when someone is in the midsts of composing an iMessage reply to one of your ongoing conversations.
* If you want to try TypeStatus out, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it can be downloaded for free. As always, we urge you to share your sentiments in the comments below.
