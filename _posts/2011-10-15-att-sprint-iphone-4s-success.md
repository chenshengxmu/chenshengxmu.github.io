* The iPhone 4S officially went on sale in the US yesterday, and unsurprisingly, it has provided record-setting sales for at least two of the three major U.S carriers that offer the device.
* AT&T on Friday confirmed to BGR in an email that it has activated a record number of iPhones and is on track to double its previous record of activations in a single day.
* Sprint, which didn’t start carrying the iPhone until this month, reported its best ever day of sales in retail, web, and telesales for a device family in Sprint history, thanks to the launch of the new iPhone 4S and iPhone 4…
* Sprint Product Chief, Fared Adib:
* “Sprint today reported its best ever day of sales in retail, web and telesales for a device family in Sprint history with the launch of iPhone 4S and iPhone 4. We reached this milestone at approximately noon CT/1pm ET. The response to this device by current and new customers has surpassed our expectations and validates our customers’ desire for a truly unlimited data pricing plan.”
* Sprint is the only U.S. iPhone carrier that currently offers an unlimited data plan to its customers.
* These numbers probably explain the activation issues new iPhone owners were facing yesterday.
