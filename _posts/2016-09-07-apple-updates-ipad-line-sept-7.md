* Despite not mentioning the iPad once during today’s iPhone 7 event, Apple has issued some minor updates to select models in its tablet line. For starters, all standard iPads have had their base storage option doubled from 16GB to 32GB.
* This change brings the iPad family inline with Apple’s just-announced iPhone 7 storage options, and it applies to the iPad mini 2, iPad mini 4, and the iPad Air 2. The nice thing is that all of these models will stay at their current prices.
* Additionally, Apple has lowered the pricing on upper-tier storage options for both iPad Pro models, knocking $50 off 128GB versions and $100 off 128GB. It’s also changed around some of the configurations and pricing for older iPad.
* Here is a breakdown of the new lineup and pricing:
* iPad mini 2
* iPad mini 4
* iPad Air 2
* 9.7-inch iPad Pro
* 12.9-inch iPad Pro
