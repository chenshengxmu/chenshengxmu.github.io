* T-Mobile released its earnings report for its first quarter late last night, and the numbers aren’t looking too good. The carrier saw a 7% dip in its revenue from the same three month period last year, as well as a 7.5% drop in profits.
* But it wasn’t all bad news. T-Mobile’s newly-acquired iPhone handsets seem to be doing very well, with the company reporting that it has sold more than 500,000 of them since they officially went on sale last month (the 12th)…
* From T-Mobile’s press release (via AllThingsD):
* “On April 12, 2013, T-Mobile USA began selling the iPhone at all Company-owned stores in combination with the new Simple Choice service plan. To date the Company has sold approximately 500,000 iPhone5’s to new and existing customers.”
* T-Mobile was the last of the 4 major carriers in the US without an Apple partnership when it finally started offering the iPhone last month. Its new ‘Un-Carrier’ makes the iPhone 5 $99 up front and $20 per month without a contract.
* And that’s just one of the big moves the company has made in recent months. It’s also launched an LTE network, and new unlimited plans, and it just acquired 9 million new subscribers thanks to the completion of its MetroPCS deal.
* So despite the earnings drop, CEO John Legere remains confident in T-Mobile’s direction. “Our first quarter operating metrics and financial results are showing positive impact from the changes we began making in the fourth quarter.”
