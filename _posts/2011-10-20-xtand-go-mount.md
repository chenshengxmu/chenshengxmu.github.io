* The Xtand Go is an extremely flexible, minimal car mount that lets you easily access your iPhone from your dashboard or windshield. The mount is adpative to your smartphone, meaning that you can use the Xtand Go with or without an iPhone case.
* German engineering makes the Xtand Go an incredibly reliable mount that’s also adjustable for the iPhone’s portrait and landscape orientations. The Xtand Go works perfectly with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, and attachable “Go Buttons” can be used to let any smartphone attach to the Xtand Go quickly.
* The Xtand Go’s adjustable mount lets you rotate the iPhone a full 360 degrees for the perfect angle. The mount itself is pocket-size, and it stays out of the way when you’re traveling.
* Once you’ve used suction to attach the Xtand Go to your dashboard or windshield, you can insert your naked iPhone 4/4S without having to adjust the mount’s brackets. If you have another smartphone, cased iPhone, or even an iPod touch you’d like to mount, you can use the included glue-free “Go Buttons.”

* This looks like one seriously cool iPhone car mount. The Just Mobile folks already make a ton of great accessories for Apple products.
