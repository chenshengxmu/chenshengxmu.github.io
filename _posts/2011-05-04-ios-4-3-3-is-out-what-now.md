* Apple just released iOS 4.3.3 and as usual when a new firmware is out, we try to make sure we warn you about the potential risks. Experienced iPhone users might want to skip this post, but if you’re new to the iPhone and especially jailbreaking, read on.
* If your iPhone is jailbroken/unlocked, the first thing to do is to make sure you do not update to iOS 4.3.3. Updating will supercede your jailbreak, rendering it useless. As always when Apple releases an update to the software, make sure you hold on until new jailbreak/unlock is available…
* Additionally, saving your SHSH blobs is a very good thing to do as well. In case something goes wrong with the latest iOS 4.3.3, saving your SHSH blobs would allow you to downgrade to 4.3.2. Ideally, you have already done that. If not, hurry and save your SHSH blobs now (or click here to learn more about SHSH blobs).
