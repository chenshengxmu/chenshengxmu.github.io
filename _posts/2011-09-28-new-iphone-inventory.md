* We are still trying to piece together some sort of picture of what Apple will be unveiling next week. The Cupertino company has done a pretty good job so far of keeping its Fall plans a secret. The stuff we think we know at this point is only based on speculation.
* 9to5Mac added some more pieces to the puzzle this morning by reporting that 5 new products have turned up in Apple’s inventory. The first three devices appear to be new iPod touches, and the other two? Well, the other two are new iPhone models…
* The new iPod touches show up in Apple’s system with the product SKU N81A. For those who don’t know, SKUs are short codes used in large inventory systems to quickly identify merchandise. And as 9to5Mac points out, the code matches up with previous models.
* “Three new iPod touch models have appeared in the system with the codename n81A. N81 is the codename for the fourth-generation black iPod touch, so the A likely represents the string of the three new white models. Since there are only three new models  – at this time – it’s likely that the black models won’t be updated.”
* We’ve seen evidence that a white iPod touch exists. Last month we saw a white faceplate surface for Apple’s popular media player. And if you think about it, it almost makes sense for Apple to leave the black model alone. Nobody has a white iPod touch. (Unless you buy a conversion kit, of course.)
* Now, for the new iPhones:
* “Even more interesting are the two new iPhone SKUs that have showed up in the system. The catch is that these two SKUs are actually marked as tweaked iPhone 4s. The new device’s codename is N90A and this represents very minor changes from the iPhone 4 — which is the N90. In fact, this may be an iPhone 4 — an 8GB version as previously rumored.”
* Great. So now we have the N94 device that was discovered in iOS months ago, hundreds of mysterious cases that appear to be based on a completely redesigned iPhone, and these N90A handsets. Yeah, October 4th can’t come soon enough.
