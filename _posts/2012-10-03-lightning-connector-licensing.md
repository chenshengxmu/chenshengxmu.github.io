* The tiny Lightning connector that debuted on the new iPhone, iPod touch and iPod nano allows Apple to exercise a much tighter control over the accessories ecosystem, it has been revealed. According to a new report out this morning, all vendors seeking to make products bearing the ‘Made for iPhone’ (MFi) trademark must be approved by Apple.
* Additionally, club Cupertino is requiring vendors to manufacture their gear in Apple-approved facilities. Apple is currently educating them on the new terms so don’t expect first officially approved third-party Lightning accessories before late-October or November…
* iLoounge has the story:
* Multiple reliable sources have confirmed to iLounge that Apple has made significant changes to its Made For iPad/iPhone/iPod (MFi) policies, tightening control over the manufacturing of Lightning accessories.
* iMore editor Rene Ritchie confirmed on Twitter that changes to Lightning connector licensing are accurate.
* According to sources who spoke with iLounge, “only Apple-approved manufacturing facilities will be allowed to produce Lightning connector accessories, even including third-party accessories”.
* This doesn’t bode well for Lightning accessories like these.

* Put simply, vendors will have a hard time engineering and selling Lightning accessories without paying Apple an MFi licensing fee. As a result, Apple gets to charge a premium on its own Lightning cables and adapters, seen below.

* To prevent non-compliant third=party alternatives, Apple built an authentication chip in both the Lightning connector and cable.
* The report goes on to note that Apple hasn’t approved any factories yet so it remains unclear if Lightning-approved accessories will arrive in time for Christmas.
* Apple, according to the publication’s source, is planning a seminar this month in China to discuss changes to the MFi program and the rules for Lightning accessory development going forward.
* A recent patent filing proves that Apple is also researching a wireless adapter to connect legacy accessories to latest iOS devices.
* Thoughts?
