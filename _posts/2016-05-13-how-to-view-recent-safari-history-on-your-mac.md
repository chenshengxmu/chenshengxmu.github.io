* Not only does Safari give you the fastest way to surf the web on your computer, it’s also the most energy efficient web browser on OS X that maximizes your Mac’s battery life.
* As so many Mac owners use Safari on a daily basis, their browsing histories are packed to the gills with records of previously visited websites.
* Finding your way back to a previously visited site by searching the entire browsing history can be quite tedious with months or years of data stored in it.
* Like on iOS, Safari for Mac provides a convenient shortcut that lets you quickly jump to any previously visited webpage on a per-tab basis.
* 1) Fire up Safari on your Mac, open a new tab and visit a few websites and follow a few links on each.
* 2) Click and hold Safari’s Back button in the top toolbar.
* 3) Select a previously visited webpage in the menu and let go of the mouse button.
* Long-clicking Back/Forward button in Safari pulls up a tab’s history list.

* The websites you see in this list are specific to the current tab’s history. If you switch to another tab and click-and-hold Safari’s Back/Forward button, you’ll see a different browsing history depending on the specific websites you visited in that particular tab.
* This shortcut also works in Safari on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
