* Arguably the biggest change to iOS 5.1 when compared with its predecessors is the Lock screen camera functionality.
* Instead of double pressing the Home button to reveal the camera icon on your Lock screen, the camera icon is a permanent fixture.
* Revealing the actual camera also works quite differently than in times past. Check out our video walkthrough of the new iOS 5.1 Lock screen camera functions inside…
* With iOS 5.1, instead of tapping the camera icon, you slide up on the icon to reveal the camera.
* The Lock screen camera still respects passcode locks, so that you can only take shots and review shots that were taken while at the Lock screen.
* What do you think about the new Lock screen camera functionality? Do you think it’s an improvement?
