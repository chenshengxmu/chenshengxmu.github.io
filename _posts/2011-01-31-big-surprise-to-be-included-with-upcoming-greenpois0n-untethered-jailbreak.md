* If you’ve been keeping your ear to the street, a.k.a. keeping up with the latest jailbreak news on Twitter, then you may have stumbled upon several rumblings about a “big surprise” that will be included with the upcoming GreenPois0n jailbreak.
* This newest version of GreenPois0n will provide an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 firmware, and is destined to arrive any day now.
* What could the so-called “big surprise” be? Will it be something we’ve seen before? Will it be a totally new feature that will blow our minds?

* A day or so ago on Twitter, @Jaywalker9988 posted a tweet saying that “…we have something in store for your guys in the new GP.” Now normally, seeing something like this on Twitter wouldn’t be huge big deal, but then he goes on to say that he works on GP, and that he just showed someone the surprise.
* What surprise? Is this even legit?
* I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first, that is until Chronic Dev Team member @p0sixninja re-tweeted the comments from an individual who evidently was shown the surprise.
* In response to the showing, they commented: “The surprise for the newest Green Poison [sic] is sick! I love it!”

* Now of course this is just talk on Twitter, but I have to admit that it seems as if the Chronic Dev Team might have something big in store for us with the upcoming release of GreenPois0n.
* All we can do now is speculate. What do you think the big surprise is?
* I’ll go out on the limb and say perhaps there’s a baseband downgrade option thrown in to allow users on newer basebands to unlock. Extremely unlikely, but a guy can dream, can’t he?
* Remember, this is just speculation on my end, nothing concrete until we hear the official word from Chronic Dev.
