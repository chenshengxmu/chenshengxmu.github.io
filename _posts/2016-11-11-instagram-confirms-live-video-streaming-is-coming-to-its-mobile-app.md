* According to Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom in the Financial Times newspaper this morning, the popular photo-sharing service will be gaining the ability to stream live video. “Live is really exciting for us,” Systrom said without detailing when it’ll launch in the mobile app. Russian news outlet Tjournal.ru was first to report that Instagram appears to have been testing the upcoming feature with a subset of its Russian users.
* Here’s what Instagram’s boss told the paper:
* Live is really exciting for us. I think it can enhance what we’re doing. If I’m trying to strengthen relationships with someone I love, them streaming video to me live would be an amazing way to be closer to them.
* Facebook’s Zuckerberg said recently his company was prioritising video “across our family of apps”. For example, Facebook is currently testing making video more central to the news feed while the Messenger team is also testing new camera and video features.
* “People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it’s pretty clear that video is only going to become more important,” Zuckerberg said on Facebook’s earnings call.
* Again, Systrom didn’t exactly say when the feature will become available.

* The app will provide a red “Go Insta!” button to allow users to instantly begin streaming live video to their followers. Live videos will also appear in users’ Stories and a bold LIVE banner at the top of the Stories feed will distinguish them from other posts.
* Moreover, the app will provide a list of popular live broadcasts.
