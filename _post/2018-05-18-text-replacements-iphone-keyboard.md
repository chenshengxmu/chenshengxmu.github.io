* Maybe you just bought your first iPhone (good for you!) or maybe you simply forgot that your device offers a text replacement feature.
* Text replacements can help you reduce errors when typing as well as get your message across faster. You can create a shortcut and when typed, it will expand into the complete word, phrase, or sentence you that you apply to it.
* This is a handy feature for inserting things you type often, especially in text messages or emails. Here’s how to set up and use text replacements.
* To start setting up your text replacements, just open your Settings app and follow these steps:
* 1) Tap General > Keyboard.
* 2) Tap Text Replacement.
* 3) Tap the plus sign on the top right. Note that this screen shows any text replacements that you set up.
* 4) Type in the phrase that you would like to shorten. For example, you may type in your email address, a phone number, or a phrase you use often.
* 5) Type in the shortcut you would like to use. For example, “myem” might be for your email address, “800” might be for a phone number, or “tyt” might be for a phrase.
* 6) Tap Save on the top right.
* After you tap Save, you will return to the Text Replacement screen where you should see the shortcut you just added.

* If you want to edit a text replacement, just tap on it, make your changes, and tap Save.
* This is the best part: using your text replacements. Whenever you type something, whether it’s an email, text message, document, note, or anything else, you’re set.
* 1) Type the replacement shortcut you created.
* 2) When your corresponding text appears, tap the Space bar on your keyboard.
