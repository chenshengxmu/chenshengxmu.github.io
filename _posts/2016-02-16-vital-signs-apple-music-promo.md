* The rumored Apple-backed television show “Vital Signs” will feature some notable Apple Music product placement, as per sources who spoke to Re/code’s Peter Kafka.
* Rather than being Apple’s surprise foray into full-scale production of TV shows, Apple will simply co-finance the production of “Vital Signs.”
* “That’s much less exciting than ‘Apple Is Getting Into TV,’ but it’s more accurate,” Kafka said. The show will apparently star Beats co-founder and Apple executive Dr. Dre.
* According to an insider, Apple’s been financing music videos, behind-the-scene footage and other related videos for top artists as a way “to extend Apple Music.”
* “And it’s doing that with the Dre show,” as per the report.
* The Hollywood Reporter set the tongues wagging with last week’s report that Apple was getting into the TV business, sort of. The production of “Vital Signs” is reportedly “being bankrolled by Apple,” the report alleged.
* No matter how you look,  that doesn’t imply Apple is doing its own scripted TV show.
* ”Vital Signs,” according to The Hollywood Reporter, is a semi-autobiographical show with each episode focusing on a different emotion and how Dre’s character deals with it.
* The show, said those who have seen the first episode, is “a dark drama with no shortage of violence and sex,” with one episode featuring “an extended orgy scene.”
