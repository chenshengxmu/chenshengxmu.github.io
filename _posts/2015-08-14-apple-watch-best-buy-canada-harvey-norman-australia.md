* Keeping true to its promise, Best Buy Canada today began carrying the Apple Watch in its retail stores throughout the country. The electronics retailer’s online store in Canada is now selling Apple’s watches, too. In addition, the Apple Watch is now available through the Australian department store Harvey Norman’s outlets in Auburn, New South Wales.
* Best Buy Canada made the news official on Twitter.
* “We know our customers want Apple Watch. It has become one of the most popular searched products on BestBuy.ca,” said Tony Sandhu, Senior Vice President of Merchandising at Best Buy Canada. “We’re excited to bring the highly coveted Apple Watch to more Canadian consumers, especially with the holidays coming up.”
* The electronics retailer is offering a total of sixteen different Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models, but not the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition. Both online and brick-and-mortar Best Buy stores in Canada also sell a range of accessories designed for Apple’s wearable device.

* As for Harvey Norman, a large Australian retailer which sells electrical, computer, furniture, entertainment and bedding goods, they began selling the device on August 15 (this morning in Pacific Time) at its outlets in Auburn, New South Wales.
* Like Best Buy, Harvey Norman offers a bunch of aluminum Apple Watch Sport and stainless steel Apple Watch models, but not the 18-karat gold version. The retailer did not say when, or if the device will launch at its other stores throughout Australia.
* It’s worth mentioning that both Best Buy Canada and Harvey Norman allow walk-in customers to try on the device before purchasing it. According to Apple, “More than 50 Best Buy stores will carry Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models in time for the holiday shopping season.”
* Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
