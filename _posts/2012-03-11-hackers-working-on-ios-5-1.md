* Those of you who have ignored our warnings and upgraded your devices to iOS 5.1 in the past week will be happy to hear that hackers are already hard at work on jailbreaking the new software.
* As expected, the 5.1 update, which Apple released last week alongside its new iPad, effectively breaks the exploits used in both the Corona and Absinthe jailbreak tools…
* But the good news is that Pod2g seems to be already working on a jailbreak for the software. The infamous hacker, who is largely responsible for both of the aforementioned jailbreaks, recently commented on Twitter that he is “working actively on finding vulnerabilities” in iOS 5.1.
* This may not seem like a very big deal — after all, that’s only the first step of many in creating a jailbreak — but we’re still glad to hear the news. After losing prolific hackers like GeoHot and Comex, it’s good to know that pod2g plans on sticking around for a while.
* There’s no other details at this time, but rest assured that you’ll know more the second that we do.
* Thanks Nick!
