* You don’t have to be jailbroken very long before you hear about Activator. The popular tweak allows you to initiate frequent tasks with button taps or on-screen gestures.
* What’s cool about Activator is that it’s compatible with hundreds of other Cydia packages, including the one we’re going to be discussing here — RapidContact. The tweak allows users to quickly call or text a favorite contact…
* RapidContact is just a simple utility that allows you to launch the SMS composition screen or dial pad with a pre-programmed number. You can preset the number from the Settings app, or tell it to automatically recall the last number you called.
* The package would’ve received bonus points if it had a BiteSMS-style quick reply keyboard. The fact that it just launches the stock SMS app is kind of pointless comparatively. However, the quick-dial function would be useful for folks who frequently call the same person.
* I won’t be trading SMSPlus in for this tweak, but I think other users will find it handy. The price is certainly right. You can download RapidContact from Cydia for free.
* Have you tried RapidContact yet?
