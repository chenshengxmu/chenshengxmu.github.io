* Let me fill you in on a little secret; no one wants to watch your hour-long vacation videos. Friends and family will oblige you, but they are only being polite. What would make everyone’s day is if you would just throw together the best five or 10 minutes of the trip, set it to a nice soundtrack, add a few effects, and call it a day.
* We’ve got a list of the best apps for shooting and editing videos so you can quickly slap together the perfect montage and keep your friends from falling asleep during your kid’s graduation memories.

* Of course Apple’s signature movie making app is going on this list. It is easy to use, includes some fantastic features, and makes your mini movies look professionally done. Select from pre-made trailer templates to make your own movie trailer. Choose from eight different movie themes and transitions to create the perfect film. Enhance your video with a variety of effects, including slow motion, picture-in-picture, and split screen. You can add a personal soundtrack and then share your finished piece with others. This app is available for $4.99. [EDIT: One of our readers wanted me to remind everyone that if you purchased an iOS 7 compatible device after Sept., 2013, iMovie is free.]

* Hipstamatic recently came out with a video making app that includes all of the awesome film and filter effects you’ve grown to love. Shoot three to 15 second clips and then merge them together to make a short film. Rearrange clips in the order you want and select from a variety of hip video filters. Add a soundtrack and then publish your work on Instagram, Facebook, or Vine in an instant. This app is available for free.

* Remember how annoying it was when friends would take those lame vertical videos? Luckily, the faux pas seems to have made itself known and a lot less people are making such a mistake. If you still know someone that takes vertical videos, show them this app. You will be doing them a favor, while avoiding having to see their awkwardly tall and thin videos at the same time. Horizon was also recently updated to work with photos and it now supports 2K resolution and 120 frames per second. This app is available for $1.99.

* Maybe on your last camping trip, you took more photos than you did videos. That’s ok. With this app, you can combine them into one seamless mini movie. Add effects and filters to spice up your visuals. Import photos into your videos to make awesome montages. Add overlays to turn your videos into art. Add your own audio tracks so you can narrate or make sound effect for each scene. This app is available for free.

* Have you ever wished you could capture the entirety of that Perfect Day? With this app, you can do so by just holding your finger down on the screen and capturing a few seconds at a time. Once you’ve recorded all of the best moments of that day, add filters and effects and add a song to really capture the memory. If you want to make multiple videos throughout that same day, or across multiple days, you can do so by saving and adding a new project. Create as many 45-second videos as you like. This app is available for $1.99.

* Call me old-fashioned, but I love black-and-white films. The silent era produced some of the best movies to this day. Sometimes, I like to recreate my own silent film using this fun video filter app. Set it to the decade you wish to reflect by selecting the appropriate filter and then hit the record button to make your movie. Touch the frame shake button to add additional timely effects like jitters. Add a lens filter like scratched film to age the video. This app is available for $1.99.
