* Good news Mac users. In addition to all of the cool stuff Apple has already outlined in Mac OS X Mavericks, the new software is also going to include a number of improvements to the way it handles notifications.
* Easily the coolest thing about the enhancements is that you can now quick reply to notifications. This is something that iOS users have been clamoring for for years. Hopefully it’s a sign of things to come.
* More details after the fold…

* Another new notification-related feature in OS X Mavericks is the ability to handle app push notifications. Users can now opt to have notifications from their iOS devices pushed to their Mac laptop or desktop.
* So not only did Apple fix the notification-sync problem, but it’s added the ability to quickly respond to alerts. Users will be able to quickly reply to iMessages, e-mail, and FaceTime calls just by clicking on the notification.
* Notifications let you see what’s up — and now they let you get things done, all without leaving the app you’re in. With OS X Mavericks, you can interact with your notifications, so you can reply to a message, respond to a FaceTime video call, or delete an email right from a notification. In addition, you can now sign up with your favorite websites to get breaking news, sports scores, auction alerts, and more — even if Safari isn’t running. And if you’ve stepped away from your Mac, you’ll find a summary of all the notifications you missed as soon as you return.
* Can’t wait!
