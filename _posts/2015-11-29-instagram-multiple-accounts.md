* Mobile photography service Instagram is testing a new feature with a subset of its users that was designed to permit users to seamlessly manage multiple accounts and switch between them, without having to sign out of their current account, AndroidPolice said two days ago.
* The feature is now being tested with some users who are enrolled in the company’s official Android beta testing program, and should come to the iOS app soon.
* The feature is live for some, but not all beta testers who are using Instagram 7.12.0 for Android. Instagram’s iOS app is currently at version 7.11.0 so it’s fairly safe to assume that an update for the iPhone with multiple account support is imminent.

* After adding another Instagram account using the app’s new Add Account feature in the settings, just below the Clear Search History option, a selector appears next to the account nickname on the top of your profile page.
* To switch between both accounts, you just tap your username in the navigation bar, and choose a desired account in a drop-down list.

* “In the settings, you’ll be able to log out of these new accounts individually or of all accounts altogether,” as per AndroidPolice.
* This should be a great addition for people who use Instagram for both work and play and those who have multiple Instagram accounts.
