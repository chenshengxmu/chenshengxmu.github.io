* You can now mark any image in Google Photos as your favorite.
* To do so, you just hit a brand new orange star icon in the corner in order to mark the currently viewed photo as your favorite. The favorited photo is automatically added to the built-in “Favorites” album so feel free to head to the Albums tab to view all your favorites in one place.
* Apple’s Photos app for iOS and macOS has included this feature from its inception.
* It’s OK to play favorites. Rolling out this week, tap the star button to mark a photo as a favorite. Head to the Albums tab and view all your favorites in one place. pic.twitter.com/eWnSMDKQ72

* According to the search monster, Favorite on Google Photos is rolling out this week.
* This feature is like Favorites, but limited to shared images.
* You’ll be permitted to mark any photo a friend just shared with you using a new heart option. Simply tap the new heart icon when viewing a shared album or photo to “heart” shared content.
* Coming soon, you can give some love to the photos your friend just shared. Look out for the heart icon when viewing a shared album or photo. pic.twitter.com/C2OVsyX3fO

* That one is “coming soon,” Google said.
* Back at I/O 2018, Google talked about some pretty cool capabilities for the Photos app that take full advantage of its machine learning hardware and software and artificial intelligence.
* Check them out quickly in a Google I/O video segment included below.
* Specifically, you can now use one-tap suggested actions to brighten, archive, share or rotate your photos. The app will even change black-and-white shots into color and remove background colors from an image while keeping your subject perfectly intact.

* And thanks to an API, Google Photos will soon work with your favorite apps and devices.
* The Internet giant recently unveiled a new Google 1 subscription that includes more affordable cloud storage compared to Google Drive with family sharing.
* The available subscriptions come with a few additional perks, such as live 24/7 customer service for all of Google’s consumer products and services by phone, chat or email, Google Play credits and discounts on hotels found through Google Search.
* The restructured cloud-storage tiers include a new $2.99 per month option with 200 GB of storage, the removal of the $9.99 per month 1 TB plan and reducing the price of the previously-pried $19.99 per month 2 TB tier to just $9.99 per month.
* Here are all the Google 1 plans:
* The firm will upgrade existing 1 TB Drive plans to the new 2 TB one at no extra cost.
* Google Photos for iOS is a free download from App Store.
