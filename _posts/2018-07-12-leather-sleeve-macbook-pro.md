* Apple has announced all-new Leather Sleeves for the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. The accessory arrives on the same day the company announced its MacBook Pro lineup for 2018. 
* Available in Saddle Brown, Midnight Blue, and Black, the sleeves are made of high-quality leather and a soft microfiber lining for extra protection. Previously, the Leather Sleeves were only available for the 12-inch MacBook.
* You can purchase the 13-inch Leather Sleeve for $179; the one for the 15-inch model is priced at $199.
* The 2018 MacBook Pro lineup includes the ability to purchase a six-core processor and 32GB of RAM for the first time. However, this will cost you. The maxed-out MacBook Pro will set you back $6,669.
* Are you planning to buy a new MacBook Pro? Which one?
