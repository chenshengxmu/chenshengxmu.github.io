* Today is Friday and you know what that means, no? That’s right, every Friday a new app goes free in the App Store in Apple’s ongoing Free App of the Week promo.
* Hopefully, you haven’t forgotten about downloading PAC-MAN, last week’s Free App of the Week. Those who missed it needn’t despair as Apple’s new freebie is definitely worth getting excited about.
* Spark Camera, a cool iPhone photography app from Ideo (the design shop that created Apple’s first mouse) arrived last October. The program got Lory and the rest of the iDownloadBlog team drooling over its sharp, easy to use interface and great features aimed at creating gorgeous mini montages by stitching together your snippets of a moment in time.
* Spark Camera is normally priced at $1.99, but you can now grab it free of charge until next Thursday, courtesy of Apple’s Free App of the Week…
* According to Apple’s Editors’ Choice citation:
* Thanks to a beautifully minimalist design, Spark Camera lets you make memorable videos at a dizzying speed.
* Easily capture clips, apply one of ten striking filters, add a song from your library, and then share your creation with friends and family through a variety of social-networking services.
* For a more in-depth look, check out Lory’s launch review.

* The universal app weighs in at 13.4MB and requires iOS 6.or later.
