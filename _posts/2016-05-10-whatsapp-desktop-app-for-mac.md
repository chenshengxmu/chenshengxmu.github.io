* WhatsApp on Tuesday launched a native desktop app for Mac and Windows computers. The Facebook-owned messaging service says the app provides a “new way to stay in touch anytime and anywhere – whether on your phone or computer at home or work.”
* To download the new desktop version of WhatsApp, visit whatsapp.com/download from your desktop browser. Then, open the app and scan the QR code using the WhatsApp app on your smartphone (be sure to look for WhatsApp Web menu under Settings).
* Like WhatsApp Web, our desktop app is simply an extension of your phone: the app mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device. 
* The new desktop app is available for Windows 8+ and Mac OS 10.9+ and is synced with WhatsApp on your mobile device. Because the app runs natively on your desktop, you’ll have support for native desktop notifications, better keyboard shortcuts, and more.
* WhatsApp is one of the largest cross-platform messaging services in the world. In February, Facebook announced that it is now seeing 1 billion active users per month. And in April, the company introduced end-to-end encryption for increased security and privacy.
