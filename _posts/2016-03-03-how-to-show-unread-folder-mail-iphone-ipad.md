* Apple’s Mail app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad offers various customization options which permit you to adjust which messages you see first in the mailbox list. For instance, you can add important people to Mail’s VIP list so all their messages appear in the special VIP smart mailbox.
* I’m not sure why, but Mail by default doesn’t let you see all the unread messages from all accounts in one place, and that’s quite a shame.
* Thankfully, you can easily show a hidden ‘Unread’ smart folder to gather your unread messages in one place.
* 1) Open Mail on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Mailboxes.
* 3) Now hit the Edit button.
* 4) Mail will show you a list of its built-in mailboxes, smart or otherwise. Scroll down and then tap Unread further to enable the smart mailbox with unread messages.
* 5) Tap Done to finish making the changes.

* All the unread messages from all your accounts will be automatically gathered inside the Unread inbox as they arrive. And as each message in the Unread mailbox is read, Mail will automatically remove it from the list.

* Tip: While in edit mode, you can reorder your mailboxes by dragging them around. I suggest moving the Unread mailbox at the top of the list so it’s easier to access without having to scroll through the mailbox list.
