* iOS 12 turns your iPad into an even better multitasking machine by allowing you to easily cycle through your open apps using a natural and convenient one-finger gesture which augments Apple’s existing but unwieldy four-fingered horizontal swipe.
* Before iOS 12, switching to a previously used app without invoking the app switcher required swiping left or right across the screen with four or five fingers. On iOS 12 and newer, you can just swipe a little bit up then right in a quick slide. Even better, just swipe across the bottom horizontally and slightly up as if you were trying to create an arch with your finger.

* I’m pretty sure this new gesture prepares us for future iPads without Home buttons. As a matter of fact, I bet the next iPad Pro will come outfitted with a TrueDepth camera and no Home button. Moreover, I’m pretty sure Apple will then tweak this new one-finger multitasking gesture to work like on iPhone X, just by swiping horizontally across the Home indicator.
* Like before, iOS 12 lets you turn off the multitasking gestures in Settings → General → Multitasking & Dock and decide if apps should be allowed to check for new content in the background through Settings → General → Background App Refresh.
