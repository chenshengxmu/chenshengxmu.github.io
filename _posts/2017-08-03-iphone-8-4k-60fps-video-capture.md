* iPhone 8 may become the first smartphone to provide its owners with the ability to capture video in 4K resolution at a silky smooth sixty frames per second via both front and rear cameras, as per code strings uncovered from the HomePod firmware by Brazilian outlet iHelp.
* Strings in the firmware indicate that both front and rear cameras of iPhone 8 may feature 4K video capture at sixty frames per second, as evidenced on the screenshot top of post.
* Current iPhones capture full HD (1080p) video at sixty frames per second.
* However, as many of you know, video capture in 4K resolution is limited to thirty frames per second, like with other high-end devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy S8. If there’s smoke to this fire, iPhone 8 will become the first smartphone to include this feature.
* I’m wondering if we may also see 1080p Slo-Mo video capture at 240 frames per second.
* We should point out that a similar discovery was made more than two years ago, with strings in iOS 9 code indicating at the time that the FaceTime camera would include features like panoramic mode and Slo-Mo video capture at 240FPS, which it never did.
* iOS 9 is hinting at future device front cameras having: 1080p resolution, 240fps slow mo, panoramamic capture, flash pic.twitter.com/NkMjdsUZEX

* Still, this could be a major, major development.
* As soon as I captured my first (1080p) video at 60FPS with my rusty old iPhone 6s, I never went back to 30FPS. 60FPS content looks so much better than the 30FPS clips and that smoothness should be even more pronounced in crisp 4K resolution.
* And if iPhone 8 adopts the ProMotion display from the new iPad Pros, those 60FPS videos should look stunning on its high-resolution Retina display at the insane refresh rate of 120Hz.
* I wouldn’t count on the front facing cam supporting 4K @dujkan there’s references to front telephoto and rear PeealID. not likely. pic.twitter.com/fZdTAAWO1h

* Plus, you’ll be able to enjoy your 4K 60FPS clips on a big screen via an upcoming Apple TV.
* And if you’re worried about the file size, don’t be: both iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra pack in support for High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), also known as H.265.
* Approved three and a half years ago, H.265 is capable of compressing 4K video with a wider range of colors at half the file size versus the H.264 codec that’s used in current Apple devices.
* Hold on to your butts because this is going to be one heck of a phone.
