* Just when you thought the onslaught of software releases was finished for the day, Apple drops another new title. iTunes Movie Trailers for iOS is a new app that contains hundreds of movie trailers and other film related information.
* Much like other apps in the category, such as Flixster, Apple’s new Trailers software gives you access to all kinds of data regarding new movies. You can watch previews, read overviews, and discover showtimes for new releases…
* All of the trailers (at least the ones I’ve tested so far) display in HD, and look wonderful on a big screen TV via AirPlay. You can browse movies by genre, release date, and box office success. You can even do a broad search of the entire catalog.

* Just like the aforementioned Flixster app, Trailers gives you access to Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews. The service compiles reviews from hundreds of different film critics from around the globe, and is highly regarded for its opinions.

* The entire app looks and feels like an Apple production. Graphics are gorgeous, and the app itself is fairly easy to navigate. You can find movie times and participating theaters, and the app even links to fandango.com for ordering tickets online.
* It’d be nice to see in-app ticket purchasing, but other than that I really don’t have any complaints. In fact, I think this will end up replacing Flixster on my iPhone. If you want to try it out for yourself, iTunes Movie Trailers is available for free in the App Store.
* What do you think of Apple’s new movie app?
