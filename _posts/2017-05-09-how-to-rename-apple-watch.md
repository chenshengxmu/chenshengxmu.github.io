* You can personalize your Apple hardware with bespoke names, which makes it easier to distinguish the devices you own within the Settings app, in iCloud menus, when browsing your local network and elsewhere.
* I typically name all my Apple gadgets with the actual name of the product. For example, my phone is named “iPhone 7 Plus,” my computer has the “MacBook Air” name and so forth.
* This step-by-step tutorial demonstrates how to rename your Apple Watch with just a few taps.
* 1) Launch the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone.
* 2) Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom
* 3) Tap General → About → Name.
