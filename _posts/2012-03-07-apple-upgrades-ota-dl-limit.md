* Although the App Store and all of its wonderful applications are accessible over a 3G network, there’s a bit of a caveat. Apple prevents you from downloading larger applications when using anything but a Wi-Fi connection.
* That limitation used to be a measly 25MB, meaning anything over that would prompt a pop up that would tell you to connect to a Wi-Fi network to download. But it looks like today, Apple has bumped that limit up to 50MB…
* As noted by AppAdvice, applications under 50MB can now be downloaded over 3G. It appears that the same thing goes for iTunes music and videos.
* The update, which coincided with today’s iPad event, is likely to help accommodate growing app sizes as developers look to make their titles compatible with the new tablet’s Retina display.
