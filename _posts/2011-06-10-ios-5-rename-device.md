* You know in iTunes how you can rename your iPhone or iPad while it’s plugged in? With iOS 5, you can now do that directly from your iPhone. This is definitely not a groundbreaking feature but I’m sure some of you will appreciate it.
* In order to change your device name, you will have to navigate to Settings > General > About > Name…
* Is it a feature that you think you will ever use?
