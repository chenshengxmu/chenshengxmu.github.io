* The Wallpapers of the Week series is advancing in age, and with age comes experience. We keep a close eye on the section and try to determine what readers enjoy, what is a habit, a preference, a hate. Of course, data provide quantitative numbers and comments provide qualitative feedback. Crossing the two, provides a path for further posts.
* Naturally, not every reader will find their favorite wallpaper each week and they are always quick to sound off. However, there is a certain thread of wallpapers that always seem to draw positive attention: geometric shapes.
* The images below were sourced from iDevice Walls. You can find a wide selection of wallpapers, specifically for iPhone 5 and newer. Additionally, @iDeviceWall keeps a steady stream of high quality images as well.
* To download the following set of images, simply tap the wallpaper and a full resolution version will load. On your iOS device, save the image to Camera Roll and set it as wallpaper from the Share Sheet.

* The Wallpapers of the Week section is made possible by readers! If you stumble across a great image or have a resource of curated wallpapers, make sure I know about them! The best way to do this is find me on Twitter @jim_gresham. From there you can send me a link or keep up with the images I find that do not quite make the section each week.
