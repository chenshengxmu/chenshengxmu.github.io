* Breaking ground in Reno today with @GovSandoval & @MayorSchieve as part of our data center expansion plan, one of many Apple initiatives which will contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy and create 20,000 new jobs over the next 5 years. pic.twitter.com/g40dlHsxuC

* Tim Cook gave a short speech during the groundbreaking, mentioning how crucial the data center was in helping deliver iMessages, photos, and FaceTime calls around the world.
* “We’ve invested $1.6 billion in the region today and over the course of the next six years, we intend to invest an additional $1 billion,” said Cook.
* “Reno plays an incredibly important role in the products and services that we provide our customers worldwide. Without the data center here, none of this would be possible.”
* The Reno data center was a big deal for Apple, which had a clause that required Apple to build a facility near the downtown Reno tourism improvement district.
* Be sure to check out the Reno Gazette-Journal for many additional photos of Apple’s complex data centers.
