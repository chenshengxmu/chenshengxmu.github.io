* Good news for Google Glass owners in Apple’s ecosystem this morning. Google has launched MyGlass, its official companion app for its $1,500 computerized glasses, for iOS that will allow you to configure and manage them from your iPhone.
* Use the application to set up Glass, get directions on the go, screencast whatever you see on Glass to your iPhone’s display, and add Glassware and contacts. It looks like you can do everything in the iOS version that you can on Android…
* From the App Store:
* “MyGlass allows you to configure and manage your Glass device. Use it to set up Glass, get directions on the go, screencast what you see on Glass to your phone, and add Glassware and contacts. 
* If you don’t have Glass, then downloading this will be a waste of time. Sorry about that. Learn more at google.com/glass.”
* Introduction to Glass:
* If you happen to be one of the handful of people that actually owns a Google Glass device, and you also have an iPhone as well, then this app is a no-brainer. If you’re interested, you can find MyGlass in the App Store, for the iPhone only, for free.
