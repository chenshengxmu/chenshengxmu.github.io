* Earlier in the week, a video out of China gave us a nice look into iPhone 7 dummies in Gold, Rose Gold and rumored Space Black. It’s time for another iPhone 7 video as we head out into the weekend.
* Brand new footage, which surfaced last evening on Chinese social media, offers yet another comparison between a claimed iPhone 7 rear shell in rose gold finish and a Rose Gold iPhone 6s.
* Just one caveat: what you’re seeing here is likely a simple iPhone 7 case reproduction based on technical drawings and leaks rather than a fully assembled device.
* As the 30-second video attests, this dummy iPhone 7 unit in Rose Gold has two speaker grilles, the Lightning connector and no headphone jack at the bottom.
* The cleaner antenna lines can be spotted on the backside along with a bigger camera hole that now sports a curvature replacing the metal ring which surrounds the protruding camera lens on the iPhone 6/6s series.
* The bigger hole could indicate a bigger sensor with larger pixels or it could let more light in, boosting low-light photography.
* Recently leaked photos that appear to depict three iPhone models—the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Pro—gave some watchers a pause, but prolific leakster Evan Blass cautioned that Apple would release two iPhone 7 models in the fall, code-named “Sonora” and “Dos Palos” after small towns in California.
