* Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts sent out a video to Apple retail employees today, addressing concerns and questions regarding the Apple Watch and MacBook launches. In the video, posted by French site Mac4Ever, Ahrendts reiterates much of what was said in an internal memo that was sent out to employees last week.
* Here are some of her more notable comments on Watch availability:
* “I would say the number one question, in-store and online, is will you have product in the store for purchase on April 24. And this is why last week we announced that due to the high global interest, and the initial supply, that we would only be taking orders online right now. I will give you updates every single week as we have much more information, but that is the plan for right now.
* I shared with you in the note some of our thinking behind it, because it was not an easy decision. And I think it’s really important to remind every single customer, this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category. It’s the first time ever that we’ve previewed a product two weeks before the availability.”
* The executive goes on to instruct staffers to be ready for customers coming in with their pre-order Watches, looking for help with setup. She also talks about the new 12-inch MacBook, which launched earlier this month, saying that customer response has been “amazing” and it has been one of the “best MacBook launches ever.”
* Apple has taken quite a bit of criticism over the short supply of the Apple Watch and the new MacBook. The Watch, in particular, currently shows shipping estimates in June and July. Ahrendts finishes the video by saying the Apple Watch launch is a unique situation and not indicative of the company’s future launch plans.
