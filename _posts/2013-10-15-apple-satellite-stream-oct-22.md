* Earlier today, Apple sent out invitations to an October 22 media event saying “we still have a lot to cover.” It’s believed it will focus on the new iPad and iPad mini, but new MacBooks and OS X Mavericks are also expected to get stage time.
* The event itself will be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. But according to a new report, Apple plans to stream the keynote to a separate London satellite event to cater to media members not located in the US…
* 9to5Mac has the scoop:
* “For its September 10 iPhone event, Apple held simultaneous satellite streams in Berlin, Tokyo, and Beijing. For the upcoming event, the stream will be held in London, according to members of international media invited to the stream. The London-based event will begin at 6PM local time and it will be held at the Kings Place Hall. This hall fits a few hundred people.
* It is likely that the London stream will also offer an opportunity for local journalists to try out the new devices. We’re expecting an iPad mini with Retina display, redesigned full-sized iPad, new Macs, and talk of OS X Mavericks, so there will be plenty in store for the demo area.”
* The site goes on to say that it has also learned Apple will will be setting up an internal live stream for employees to view the event in company offices across the world. But unfortunately, there’s still no word on a public live stream.
* Apple did not provide a live stream of the September 10 iPhone event to its employees, nor did it provide an event stream for iOS device/Apple TV users. Apple has in the past offered live feeds for its customers, though, so it is possible.
* Regardless, the event is shaping up to be a big one. Apple is expected to introduce a wide range of new products including a redesigned iPad 5, a Retina iPad mini, new MacBook Pros, and of course OS X Mavericks is on the list as well.
