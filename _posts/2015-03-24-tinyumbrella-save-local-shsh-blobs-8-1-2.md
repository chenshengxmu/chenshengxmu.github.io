* Semaphore has been on a roll lately, as shown by the release of yet another TinyUmbrella beta build, and this version contains a significant new feature. You now have the ability to save SHSH blobs directly from a local device. This means that if you’re on a jailbreakable firmware like iOS 8.1.2, you can save the 8.1.2 blobs even though Apple is no longer signing that firmware version.
* To use the new local SHSH saving feature, you’ll need to meet a few piece of criteria. First, you’ll need to be jailbroken. Second, you’ll need the Apple File Conduit 2 package from Cydia installed. Lastly, you’ll need to be using an A7 or A8 device.
* The following devices are compatible with the new local saving feature:
* A7 Devices:
* A8 Devices:
* If you meet the aforementioned criteria, download the latest version of TinyUmbrella from Semaphore’s blog. Once you do, connect your device, and right click on the device and select Fetch SHSH on device. You can also click the Action button in the menu bar, and select Fetch Onboard.

* If you get an error message that says “Apple File Conduit “2” not found”, and you’re sure you have it installed, unplug your device from your computer and reconnect it. I’ve found that a simple unplug and replug fixes the issue, and it will then allow you to save local SHSH blobs.
* Although we still don’t have any concrete news about a future downgrading process, the likelihood that such abilities will become available looks more promising with each day that passes. This is a significant win for jailbreakers and would-be downgraders. Having the ability to revert back to iOS 8.1.2 would be awesome.
* What do you think about this latest revelation?
