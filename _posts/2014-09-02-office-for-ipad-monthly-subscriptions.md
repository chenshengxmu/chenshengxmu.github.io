* Windows maker Microsoft has just refreshed its Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps for iPad with support for month-to-month Office 365 subscriptions, the team announced today in a blog post.
* Before, users were only able to buy a yearly Office 365 subscription within the Office for iPad apps.
* Starting today, the refreshed Word, Excel and PowerPoint applications allow you to take advantage of Apple’s In-App Subscription feature to buy recurring monthly subscriptions for Office 365 Personal and Office 365 Home.
* A monthly subscription for Office 365 Personal is priced at $6.99 per month. Office 365 Home will run you $9.99 per month. These month-to-month payments compare to the previously available $99.99 annual subscription for Office 365 Home.
* As you can see for yourself, monthly subscriptions are available at a lower price compared to the annual payment option. I’ve included Microsoft’s feature matrix below for a better understanding of the various Office 365 tiers and payment options.

* The Office 365 Personal tier is for people who want to use Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote) on one tablet and a single Mac or Windows PC. The Office 365 Home tier is for individual customers and families wishing to use Office apps on up to five computers and five tablets.

* If you’ve already purchased Office 365 Home for one year, you’ll continue on the same subscription. “If you buy a monthly subscription on your iPad, you can switch to an annual subscription from your iPad, or from iTunes on your PC or Mac,” the team noted.
