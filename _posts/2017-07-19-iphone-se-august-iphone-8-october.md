* According to a rumor published by French outlet iGeneration (Google Translate) citing its own sources, Apple could unveil a second-generation iPhone SE model at a media event in August.
* The next iPhone SE could be priced at €399 instead of €489 currently, the outlet said. For comparison’s sake, in the United States the current iPhone SE lineup starts at $399.
* Additionally, the rumor claims that the Cupertino technology giant will debut the highly-anticipated iPhone 8 model with an OLED display around October.
* In other words, Apple may spread 2017 iPhone launches across two fall events, one solely dedicated to an even more affordable, updated iPhone SE model and the other serving as a launchpad for the OLED-based iPhone along with the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus devices.
* Just yesterday, a Xiaomi analyst from China questioned the future of iPhone SE, claiming Apple won’t be releasing hardware updates for its most affordable handset for the time being.
* iPhone SE made its debut in March 2016 and received new storage tiers this spring. The device is powered by Apple’s A9 chip with two gigabytes of RAM and features long battery life, a twelve-megapixel camera out the back with 4K video capture and more.
