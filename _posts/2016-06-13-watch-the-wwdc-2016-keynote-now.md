* Folks who missed Apple’s WWDC keynote this morning, or would just like to watch it again, will be happy to hear that Apple has posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. Obviously you can read everything you need to know about today’s event right here on iDB, but if you have the time, the video is worth watching.
* The keynote doesn’t appear to be available on Apple’s YouTube channel yet, so we can’t embed it in this post, but for those of you who would like to watch the clip, you can find it on Apple’s website by clicking here. Just make sure that the device you’re using has QuickTime installed, or a similar player that supports QuickTime files.
* So, what’d you think of today’s event?
