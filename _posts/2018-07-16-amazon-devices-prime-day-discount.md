* If you’re looking for a sure-fire way to score some great deals this Prime Day, look no further than Amazon’s own line of devices. The tech giant is offering up to 50% off products from its Echo, Fire and Kindle lines, as well as acquired lines like Blink and Ring. Check out our roundup of the best discounts below.
* The prices are good through Tuesday (ending Tuesday night), and of course you need to be a Prime member to take advantage of them. If you’re not a member, Amazon offers free 1-month trials for the service, or you can simply pay for a single month to take advantage of Prime Day ($12.99) and then cancel.
* Be sure to stay tuned to iDB for more Prime Day deals coverage.
