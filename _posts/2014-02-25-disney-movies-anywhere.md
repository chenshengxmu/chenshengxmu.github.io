* Disney has launched an interesting new iOS app, Movies Anywhere, which offers access to a library of hundreds of movies and exclusive content from the studio, including original programming and never-before-seen videos. It’s especially interesting that the iPhone and iPad app, available free in the App Store, allows users to connect their iTunes account to instantly access all their Disney content purchased from the iTunes Store within the app, without the need to go through Apple’s stock iOS Videos app or visit the iTunes Store…
* Upon launching, the app invites you to create a Disney account, after which you’ll be asked to connect your iTunes account to sync your content. This will take you to the iTunes Store and you’ll need to agree to a ‘Connect Accounts’ prompt by entering your iTunes Store password.
* Connecting iTunes to Movies Anywhere will allow you to stream any Disney, Pixar and Marvel content purchased from the iTunes Store, right within the app.
* Surprisingly enough, the application also enables you to buy digital content from the Walt Disney Company, with any purchase immediately registering right inside the iTunes Store and being available for re-download through the Purchased tab.

* Signing up and connecting an iTunes account will unlock Pixar’s ‘The Incredibles’ for free. The movie was released in 2004 and normally sells for $19.99 in the iTunes Store.
* Disney’s library contains hundreds of videos, with more titles coming soon. As a bonus, you can even redeem your Disney digital copies that accompany physical disc purchases.
* Last but not least, the app lets you download movies to your device for offline viewing and earn Disney Movie Rewards points for every digital transaction.
* On the downside, regional restrictions apply so not everyone can use the app or claim their free copy of ‘The Incredibes’.
* For more details, visit the Disney Movies Anywhere website.
* Disney Movies Anywhere is available free in the App Store.
* iOS 7.0 or later is required.
