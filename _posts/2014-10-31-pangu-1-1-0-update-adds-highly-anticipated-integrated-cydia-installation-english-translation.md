* It’s been a bit of a wait, but the wait is finally over for those of you who want the absolute simplest way to jailbreak iOS 8. Yesterday, Pangu updated their jailbreak tool to allow users to install Cydia manually, but today as promised, the Pangu team pushed an update to the actual Pangu install tool, bringing an automatic Cydia installation to the table. It also beings native English text to the tool as well, so that we can easily discern error messages, and removes the wretched PP installer option.
* You can download Pangu 1.1.0 right now from our downloads page. Unfortunately, the tool is still Windows only, but now that Pangu has many of the things its been working on completed, we anticipate that OS X support will be next up on their to-do list.

* A new screen in Pangu 1.1. It is suggested that Airplane mode is enabled during the jailbreak
* As expected, Pangu sent out this tweet regarding the release of the OS X version:
* We will definitely release a Mac version. But pls give us some time. If there is no major problem for v1.1 we will then focus on Mac version
