* While we haven’t seen too many app sales yet this month, we have seen quite a few apps go free for short periods of time. There was Where’s My Water, High Caliber Hunting, and EA’s Flight Control to name a few.
* Now we can add another one to the list. Gameloft has just made its popular iOS racing title, Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, free for a limited time.

* For those who aren’t familiar with the game, Asphalt 6 is the — you guessed it — 6th generation of Gameloft’s hit racing series. The title has been a huge success for its developers, garnering 5 stars in the App Store from nearly 5000 votes.
* Here are some of the game’s features:
* – Build your dream collection of high end cars and bikes
* – Race against your friends online or locally
* – Race on real world tracks in cities like L.A. and Tokyo
* – Compete in 11 different leagues and 55 events
* – Customize your vehicle down to its decals to give it your own style
* Between its gorgeous graphics and fluid gameplay, you’re not going to find a better game out there for free. But you better act fast, we’re not sure what Gameloft means by a “limited time.” Download Asphalt 6 from the App Store today.
