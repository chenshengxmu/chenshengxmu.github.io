* When you jailbreak your iOS 9.3.3 device with the latest Pangu jailbreak tool, you may end up with a third-party application store that you don’t really want on your device.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to remove the unwanted third-party application store without getting rid of Cydia or the Pangu app that you need to boot semi-untethered.
* The third-party app store that comes installed on many of these China-based jailbreaks has long been connected to the roots of app piracy, and you may also even end up installing an app that has malware built into it.
* For this reason, it’s best to simply remove the third-party app store from your iOS device after you jailbreak it with the latest Pangu jailbreak tool for Windows, or from the web with a web-based jailbreak.
* This third-party app store may be installed on your device whether you have jailbroken from a Windows PC, or if you followed the newer web-based jailbreak. So either way, it’s a good idea to look into this.
* If you want to remove that third-party app store, just to be on the safe side, then follow these steps:
* 1) Open Cydia from your Home screen and open the Installed tab at the bottom of the app.

* 2) Next, tap on the PP app store from the list of installed packages:

* 3) Now, tap on the Remove button at the top right of the Cydia app.

* 4) Another prompt will ask you to confirm the changes, so tap on the Confirm button:

* 5) A black screen appears with white text that goes through the removal process. When finished, tap on the Return to Cydia button:

* Note: The PP app store should now be removed from your list of installed extensions:

* If you check your Home screen, the third-party app store should be gone from there too:

* And that’s all there is to it! You’ve now removed your PP third-party app store, but you still have Cydia and you still have the jailbreak app that you will use to boot up your semi-untethered jailbreak.
* Removing the third-party app store from your jailbroken iOS 9.3.3 iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad is always a good idea when dealing with these jailbreaks. All you really ever need is Cydia, but in this case, you also need the booting app for the semi-untether.
