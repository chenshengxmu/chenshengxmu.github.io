* A new image surfaced online this weekend, claiming to depict a dozen iPhone 5C units in their retail packaging. The phone, which is believed to be Apple’s long-rumored budget iPhone, is shown in a transparent box similar to that of the iPod touch.
* The image was accompanied by two other photos, which also claim to show 5C packaging material. If legitimate, they offer a sneak peek at the handset’s user manual, including a device diagram and legal information, and its SIM card ejection tool…
* 9to5Mac points to the three photos, which were originally posted by iApps.im and an anonymous Weibo user. The site notes that while it’s impossible to determine the legitimacy of the photos, the packaging does line up with past patterns and reports.

* Agreed. Back in July, similar white plastic boxes with the name ‘iPhone 5C’ etched into the sides were photographed—it was the first time that we saw the 5C moniker. It’s believed that the ‘C’ stands for color, as the phone will come in various colorways.
* And, as aforementioned, the packaging in the above photo lines up with that of the iPod touch. It’s also reminiscent of last year’s iPod nano boxes, where Apple matched the color of the wallpaper in the faux Home screen image with that of the device.
* As for the manual and the SIM card ejection tool, they seem to be consistent with the material offered in the packaging of Apple’s current iPhones. However, because the photos are so blurry, it’s almost impossible to glean any information from the inserts.

* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the rumors, the iPhone 5C is expected to debut alongside the new iPhone 5S later this month. It’s believed to have similar specs to that of the current iPhone 5, with a full retail price between $300 and $400.
