* The latest update to CallBar will add seamless iOS 5 integration to the much loved jailbreak tweak.
* CallBar 1.0, as it’s being called, is the same CallBar we reviewed back in July, only perfected.
* Check inside for a video sneak preview of CallBar 1.0 before it hits Cydia…
* The new iOS 5 integration allows CallBar to take advantage of banner notifications in a way that makes it even more close to stock than before.
* A simple swipe to the right on an incoming call banner notification answers the call, while a swipe to the left declines the call.
* Volume buttons dismiss calls, but they can be retrieved, answered, or declined with a simple tap of the dismissal banner.
* The developers have really hunkered down, focusing intently on making incoming phone calls much less of an annoyance.
* As you can see from the video, it’s entirely feasible to play a game and answer an incoming call without missing much of a beat.
* CallBar 1.0 will work with the Phone app, FaceTime, Skype, and Viber out of the box, and it includes just enough options to satisfy without being overwhelming.
* Make no mistake, this is an excellent app that’s matured greatly under iOS 5. If you have a jailbroken iPhone, don’t think twice about giving it a try once it’s officially released.
* Let me know what you think about CallBar’s 1.0 update in the comments below.
