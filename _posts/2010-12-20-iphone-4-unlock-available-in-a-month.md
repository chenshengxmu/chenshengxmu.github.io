* Last month the Dev Team released an update to their UltraSn0w tool which allowed to unlock the iPhone 3G and 3GS loaded with the latest iOS 4.2.1. The iPhone 4 was left out of the equation and unless you’re still on baseband 01.59.00, you can’t unlock this device yet.
* Today, some good news was uncovered about an unlock for the iPhone 4 iOS 4.2.1 baseband 02.10.04 in a tweet sent out by Sherif Hashim. The iPhone hacker confirmed that an unlock for 02.10.04 will be available, most likely before January 16th…
* For those of you who don’t speak Arabic, here is the translation of the tweet sent to Sherif Hashim:
* I’m going to perform my military service by January 16, will I get the unlock before this date? 😀
* To which Sherif Hashim replied:
* sure 🙂
* A few weeks ago, words were going around about a possible baseband downgrade that would make the unlocking process easier and less risky, but we don’t know yet if this is going to work the the iPhone 4 as well.
* As usual, time only will tell, but I”m pretty confident that not only we’ll get an untethered jailbreak for Christmas, we might also get an unlock for the iPhone 4.
* Thoughts?
