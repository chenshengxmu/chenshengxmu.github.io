* Snapchat is reportedly gearing up to launch an internal app store of gaming titles this fall.
* This brand-new gaming platform, not to be confused with Snappables, will let outside developers create interactive gaming titles to be played through the Snapchat app, according to a new paywalled report out Wednesday from The Information.
* A Snap spokesman declined to comment.
* Sources told the publication that Snap has already lined up at least one gaming publisher to make a game for the new platform, which has been in the works for at least a year now.
* Snap has been dipping its toes into the waters of gaming since April, when it launched internally-built augmented reality games for lenses. Called Snappables, these let people play simple interactive games using the camera’s animated lenses.
* This new effort builds on those early tests that gauged user interest in games. The upcoming games platform is much broader in scope because now third-party developers are involved, too. As mentioned, users will download third-party games via an internal app store.
* It’s presently unclear how Snapchat’s app store might work given Apple’s App Store guidelines which bar all content sales in apps that bypass the firm’s In-App Purchase mechanism.
* Considering that gaming on Facebook’s Messenger platform hasn’t really caught on, it remains to be seen whether or not Snapchat’s young audience will take the plunge.
* If they do, Snap will benefit from increased engagement as users spend potentially more time on its platform. Hit games could even attach new users to the Snapchat app.
* And if the company can find a way to get those eyeballs to view more ads in other parts of the app, it could have a winner on its hands, especially as rival Instagram has been shamelessly copying every single Snapchat feature in the past two years.
* Thoughts?
