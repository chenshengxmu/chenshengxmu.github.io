* Eligible students, their parents, as well as employees of K-12 schools, have long been able to purchase Macs at educational discounts. As of today, educational pricing extends to iPads, including the latest iPad Air and the iPad mini with Retina display.
* As available through the Apple Store for Education, the entry-level Wi-Fi-only iPad Air with sixteen gigabytes of storage has been marked down to $469.
* That’s a $30 savings over its normal retailing price of $499. As for the Retina iPad mini, you’re looking at a modest $20 discount for the entry-level model…
* As noticed by French blog iGeneration [Google translate], the $20/$30 discount on the iPad Air/Retina iPad mini marks the first time Apple put iPads on educational discounts.
* The iPad 4 (or the iPad with Retina display, as Apple calls it) is available with a $20 discount, now $379 (normally $399). As for the original iPad mini, it sells for $279, $20 off versus its normal $299 price.
* Even deeper discounts are available on refurbished previous-generation iPads in Apple’s iPad for Education store. These little used devices are good as new: they have been factory refurbished, include a brand new battery and outer shell and come with Apple’s standard 1-year warranty.
* Again, these prices are only good if you’re an employee of K-12 schools, faculty, staff, student or a parent of students at higher education institutions.
* All iPads sold at educational discounts – refurbished or not – are currently available within 24 hours and include free shipping as standard. Sadly, Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad models are not available at educational prices.
* Cynics could argue that Apple’s educational discounts are a joke. If you feel this way, you’ll want to check out other places such as Best Buy and Target, which typically offer more generous discounts on iPads ($50 or more).
* This is of course assuming you’re cool with taking a discount in the form of a gift card.
* Does your local online Apple Store show these educational prices yet? And which retailer would you say offers the best deals on iPads?
