* The first developer-only beta of the upcoming iOS 10.2 software update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch brought out more than a hundred new emoji characters, including clown face, selfie, owl, shark, butterfly and pancakes, as well as updated designs for many of the existing, older emojis.
* Somewhere through the process of redrawing some of the longstanding emojis, Apple realized its design for the peach emoji didn’t quite look like a butt as the massive discontent among users vehemently insisted.
* But don’t you panic, emoji lovers and sexting addicts: iOS 10.2 beta 3 packs in a proper butt-looking peach emoji, as noted by The Next Web.
* As you can see from the comparison images of the butt peach emoji in iOS 10.0 (left), iOS 10.2 beta 1 (middle) and iOS 10.2 beta 3 (right), it looks even more like a butt now.

* People are using the peach emoji for sexting.

* Heck, I didn’t even know that was a thing!
* With this change, Apple is “acknowledging that the peach is not only used to talk about groceries, but also fulfills a more rump-shaped role,” writes The Next Web.
* I’m glad we’ve sorted out another major #FirstWorldProblem!
