* Deliveries, my favorite package tracker for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, received a major update on the App Store this morning. Bumped to version 8.0, Deliveries is now fully compatible with iOS 10 and watchOS 3 and supports many new iOS 10 features, from rich notifications and haptic feedback to a reworked widget, deeper 3D Touch support, faster background updating for the Deliveries widget and its Apple Watch app, improved suggestions when you add a delivery, an iMessage sticker pack and more.
* With iOS 10 support, you can now press on a Deliveries notification for more information and an embedded map. On devices without 3D Touch, swipe left and tap View.
* The Deliveries widget shows a single delivery by default, with a Show More button revealing as many deliveries as possible. You can also press Deliveries’ Home screen icon with 3D Touch to see the first delivery in your list.

* Taking advantage of Background App Refresh in watchOS 3, Deliveries for Apple Watch now updates in the background so it’s up to date as soon as it’s launched. The watch app improves the display of multicolor complication icons on watchOS 3, too.

* When adding a delivery, the app will now provide improved suggestions. You can swipe a suggestion on the Add Delivery screen to hide it if you like (hidden services may no longer show as suggestions).
* The Add to Deliveries Safari extension now syncs and updates immediately and automatically fills in item names for “Amazon – by tracking link” deliveries. To see the extension in action, go to Amazon’s Your Orders page in Safari, tap the Share button, and choose Add to Deliveries from the Share menu.
* Deliveries now supports Universal Clipboard so you can copy tracking information on one device and paste it into Deliveries on another. You’ll also appreciate improved tracking number detection for GLS, LaserShip, PostNL and Yamato, as well as enhanced recognition of UPS and PostNL links.

* On iPhone 7/Plus, haptics provide subtle feedback on various Deliveries actions.
* The app packs in a whole bunch of other improvements, including:
* Updating from Deliveries 5.2.1 or earlier? Existing deliveries and settings will be lost.
