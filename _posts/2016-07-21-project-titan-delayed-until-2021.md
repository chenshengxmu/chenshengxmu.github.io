* Former Wall Street Journal reporter Jessia Lessin’s outlet, The Information, this morning ran a story behind a paywall claiming that Apple’s tentative 2020 launch target for a rumored autonomous electric vehicle may have slipped until 2021. Project Titan, as it’s code-named, “has run into challenges” after its top executive left in January, as per sources.
* “One person who worked briefly with the Titan team was told during their tenure at Apple that the company had been trying to deliver a vehicle by 2020 but the target slipped to 2021,” say people briefed about aspects of the project.
* The story is actually an in-depth profile about the Sumner brothers— Brian, Kevin and Michael—who joined Apple in early 2011 to work on Siri and are now allegedly part of the Project Titan team.
* Brian is a software engineer, Kevin’s expertise is infrastructure engineering and Brian, who graduated from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, is also an engineer.
* “All three brothers, who range in age from 27 to the mid-30s, had studied computer science at UNC, about 60 miles south of the rural county where they grew up, near the Virginia border,” notes the article.
* The Silicon Valley Business Journal learned in November 2015 that Apple had quietly leased a 96,000-square-foot site in Sunnyvale, California which used to be Pepsi’s bottling plant, for its not-so-secretive electric vehicle project.
* Project Titan was headed by Apple’s Vice President of Product Design, Steve Zadesky, who left the company in January 2016 for personal reasons.
