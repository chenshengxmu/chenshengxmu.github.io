* Apple finally surpassed Microsoft in terms of market capitalization to become the world’s largest tech company. Obviously, there are many criteria on which you can rate companies and my guess is that Microsoft still surpasses Apple on many of them (ie. market shares for the personal computer market).
* Anyway you look at it, it’s still huge news. At the time I’m writing this, Microsoft market cap is at 225.58 billion dollars which Apple’s is at 226.57 billions.
* I’m glad I got some of those Apple stocks a while back…
