* After releasing its predictive touch keyboard, Fleksy, in partnership with select launch partner apps such as Launch Center Pro, GV Connect, Blindsquare and Wordbox, the San Francisco-based startup behind the software has moved the SDK out of private beta so now all iOS devs can incorporate Fleksy as an alternative soft keyboard within their apps.
* The Fleksy SDK requires no sign up, allows for different keyboard themes and is now available completely free of charge…
* According to Fleksy, the SDK allows iOS developers to implement Fleksy’s alternative touch keyboard with predictions and auto-correct capability “with zero lines of code and without having to make any changes to their app at all”.
* The keyboard uses proprietary technology to intelligently autocorrect words as you type and offers next-word predictions based on the unique way you use words together, meaning it gets smarter the more you use it and adapts to your typing style over time.
* Here’s a quick video.
* The keyboard is heavy on gestures, too: you can cycle through auto-correct suggestions by swiping up and down, insert spaces and punctuation by swiping to the right, delete words by swiping to the left and more.
* Here’s Launch Center Pro with Fleksy integration.

* Of course, third-party developers will still need to implement Fleksy keyboard functionality so this feature will be available an app-by-app basis. Those who do will be able to offer their customers a soft keyboard input method other than Apple’s stock iOS keyboard.
* Switching between Fleksy and the iOS keyboard is also completely streamlined, as demonstrated by Fleksy’s own app, the free SwiftKey note-taking app.
