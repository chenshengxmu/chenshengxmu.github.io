* Apple today acknowledged ongoing issues with iCloud backups, noting on its System Status webpage that a small percentage of customers have been unable to create new iOS device backups in iCloud or restore from previous saves since Tuesday morning.
* “Users may be unable to restore from an iCloud backup,” reads Apple’s notice.
* According to the System Status webpage, less than one precent of Apple users are affected by the outage. Given the company’s one billion active devices in the wild, that seemingly small percentage potentially translates into tens of millions of affected customers.
* The company states that its iCloud Backup service has been down since 8am Pacific on Tuesday. The downtime had persisted at the time of this writing, but other iCloud systems didn’t seem to have been affected.
* Are you experiencing issues creating iCloud backups or restoring from previous ones?
