* T-Mobile’s outspoken CEO John Legere confirmed today on Twitter that his company will be offering an iPhone 6s beginning Friday for as low as $5, $10 or $15 per month, depending on the model being purchased and older iPhone traded in, through its JUMP! On Demand device upgrade program. The lowest $5 per month pricing entails an iPhone 6 trade in, while buying a new iPhone 6s for $10 per month requires trading in your iPhone 5s.
* Customers can take advantage of this offer even if they have already pre-ordered their device with a trade-in. Leggier conformed  in another tweet that pre-orders of new iPhones at T-Mobile are up thirty percent versus the previous year.
* “With these incredible $5 and $10 a month deals, we’re giving customers just one more reason to come to T-Mobile,” said Legere.
* “This is a deal that only the Un-carrier could create, let alone make into a reality – and the crazy demand we’re already seeing tells me the carriers’ customers just aren’t buying their BS anymore. For your new iPhone the choice couldn’t be clearer.”
* Here’s the full pricing matrix for T-Mobile’s offer.

* In yet another tweet, T-Mobile USA’s boss said that customers who’d pay their phone in full at the time of purchase rather than lease it with monthly payments can do so while “getting the best deal from us.”
* 8/ Want to own your iPhone? OK. You’re still getting the best deal from us. We’re the ONLY wireless co. offering the #iPhone6s at a discount

* The company revealed its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus pricing last week. The entry-level iPhone 6s with sixteen gigabytes of storage is being offered for $0 down with an introductory JUMP! On Demand pricing of $20 per month ($24 per month for an entry-level iPhone 6s Plus) over the course of eighteen months, with your older device traded in.

* “After your 18 monthly payments, you can hand back your phone and pay nothing more,” said the carrier. “Or you can pay just $164 more if you want to keep your iPhone 6s. That means your total cost to own your phone is just $524 – that’s a screaming deal. It’s special introductory pricing for our launch, and it won’t last long.”
* So, $20 per month times eighteen months with $0 paid upfront totals $360. An additional $164 paid to keep your new iPhone brings the total cost of ownership to $524, excluding taxes and an older iPhone model trade-in.
* 10/ AND don’t forget with #JUMPonDemand you can upgrade 3X/year! Will share more details tmrw, but had to tell you about this deal ASAP! 🙂

* In addition, the carrier has also rolled out a brand new ‘Lifetime Coverage Guarantee’ which essentially ensures your happiness with T-Mobile’s network.
* The offer says that if at any point you aren’t completely satisfied with the network “for as long as you use your iPhone 6s or 6s Plus on T-Mobile”, you’ll get a refund for up to a full month of service. The Lifetime Coverage Guarantee promotion is valid for new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus purchases through JUMP! On Demand equipment installment plan.
* In case you’re dissatisfied with network performance, the carrier will refund you “for every penny you’ve paid for your new device in the first month, or after that,” and will “unlock it at no charge so you can use it with one of the other wireless companies.”
* “We’ll even refund up to a full month of your service. For phones that get unlocked, we’ll let you keep our standard interest-free payment plan at our standard prices.”
* And thanks to the new iPhones’ support for 300MBps LTE-Advanced and expanded LTE bands, the devices will support the “radically expanded LTE coverage” on T-Mobile.
* The carrier has more than doubled the square miles it blankets with LTE signal in just over a year while rolling out “truckloads of new spectrum that carries our LTE signal twice as far from our towers, for a massive coverage expansion, and works four times better in buildings.”
* It’s called Extended Range LTE − also known as “Band 12” or “700MHz spectrum,” is already live in 170 markets and covers more than half of US population.
* Again, new iPhones support T-Mobile’s Extended Range LTE.

* In addition to Extended Range LTE, T-Mobile’s network now uses other frequencies and Wideband LTE for expanded coverage. All told, T-Mobile’s LTE network now reaches over 290 million Americans.
