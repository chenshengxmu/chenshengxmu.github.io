* The iPhone 5’s iSight camera on the back features the same eight-megapixel sensor as its predecessor, the iPhone 4S, only thinner and with sapphire lens cover. In addition, the module has been improved for better low-light performance, yielding major quality improvements when snapping up your photos under artificial light or in low-light situations. And now, developer can optionally tap the iPhone 5’s low-light camera mode in their own apps, which bodes well for dozens upon dozens of photography apps in the App Store…
* Developer Jim Rhoades of Crush Apps set out to investigate a Daring Fireball report which warned that the iPhone 5’s stock Camera app was capable of using ISO speeds up to 3200, while third-party apps seemed to be limited to ISO 800.
* Jim writes on his blog:
* After posting a thread (developer login ID required) to the Apple developer forums I’ve learned that 3rd party developers CAN take advantage of this special “low light boost mode”. (Thanks Apple!).
* The ability to optionally provide this capability to user of third-party camera and photography software means a lot because there are some circumstances when you may want to avoid using the low-light mode.
* Because the iPhone 5 artificially boosts dark areas in low-light photos to bring out details, such images may appear grainy and noisy.

* Existing apps don’t automagically inherit this capability: it’s up to a specific developer to choose whether or not to update his or her app with the optional low-light boost mode (Camera+, I’m looking at you).
* Were you positively surprised or a bit underwhelmed with images taken in low-light using your iPhone 5?
