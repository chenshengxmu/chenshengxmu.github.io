* As first spotted by The Next Web, Facebook is testing an in-app GIF creator with a subset of users of its mainland mobile app for iOS. The feature is available through the app’s built-in camera and allows users to quickly create animated GIFs for sharing with friends and family.
* You can also post the GIF to a Story or save it to your device.
* GIFs can be spiced up using Facebook’s range of built-in camera effects. According to the publication, any GIFs created through this feature are short, lasting only a few seconds.

* As I mentioned before, the feature is only available to certain users.
* We’ll let you know when the in-app GIF creator launches for everyone. Until then, let us know in the comments section if you’re part of Facebook’s limited test of this feature.
* Just a month ago, the social network rolled out the ability for users to express themselves better by posting animated GIFs in comments.
* Download Facebook at no charge from App Store.
