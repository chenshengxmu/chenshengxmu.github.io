* Following rumors and speculation, Apple officially launched its iPhone trade-in program on August 30. Available in all US Apple Stores, customers can use the program to turn their old iPhones into cash—up to $280.
* At the moment, Apple is only accepting trade-ins in the United States, but that could be changing soon. According to a new report, the company has plans to launch the program in the UK within the next few months…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has the scoop:
* “That will soon change, according to a reliable source. This person says that Apple has begun preparing training materials for its United Kingdom retail staff on the Apple Store iPhone trade-in-program and that the initiative will launch in the UK in the coming months. Apple has begun training a small number of UK-based stores on the program, but it will take the company a few weeks to rollout the training across the region.”
* Gurman goes on to say that, like in the US, BrightStar will handle the trade-ins. And while Apple plans to begin training in other European countries soon, the UK launch will likely happen before a full international rollout.
* Here in the US, in order for a customer to receive credit for their iPhone it must turn on. From there, they are given a gift card of up to $280 depending on condition. Other services pay more, but aren’t nearly as convenient.
