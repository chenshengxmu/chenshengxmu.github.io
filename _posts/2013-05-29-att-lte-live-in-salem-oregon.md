* I’ve been keeping an anxious eye on AT&T’s LTE activation announcements over the past several months. I’ve had my iPhone 5 since last October, and I have yet to experience the 4G service in my home, which sits just outside Salem, Oregon.
* That changed tonight. In an inadvertent glance at my iPhone, I noticed the LTE symbol in the upper lefthand corner of my phone. I wrote it off as a fluke at first, but it appears AT&T has just lit up the 4G service in 10 new cities, including mine…
* Here’s the full list of new LTE cities:
* The 4G service was also expanded in the Capital Region, and now covers Ballston Spa, Clifton Park, East Glenville, Malta, Mechanicville, Milton Center, Niskayuna, Rotterdam, Round Lake, Saratoga County Airport, Schenectady and Schenectady County Airport.
* AT&T claims its LTE service now covers “nearly 200 million people.” And the carrier says that it plans to blanket 300 million people with LTE coverage by the end of 2014. That number is good enough for second place, behind 4G veteran Verizon.
