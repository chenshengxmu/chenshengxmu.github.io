* If you use Parental Controls on your Mac, it’s possible to see a list of websites visited in Safari or another web browser by any of your controlled users and see the date and time those websites were accessed.
* This comes in handy in a number of scenarios, but perhaps the most obvious is when you’re a parent and you want to make sure your kids aren’t doing things they shouldn’t be while online.
* To see when a specific website was accessed on any of your controlled users’ accounts, simply follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac and open the Parental Controls preferences pane:

* 3) Enter your administrator password when prompted to authenticate yourself.
* 4) Click on the user you want to learn more about in the side bar of the Parental Controls preferences pane.

* 6) In the new window, open the Web tab.

* 7) Click on the drop down arrow of any item in the website list, then click on the next drop down arrow.
* The date and time that the specific website was accessed on the controlled account should now be displayed to you.
* This can be done for any of the websites that appear in this history list. Optionally, you can also clear the history log by clicking on the Clear Log button at the bottom left of the Parental Controls preferences pane.
* Because this works for several different web browsers, whether it’s Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc., you will get to see a history log whether they use another web browser besides Safari or not, and this will come in handy.
* On the other hand, websites visited in private browsing mode will be hidden from you, so keep this in mind.
* Now the next time your child says they were doing homework research then they were really on message boards and social media sites, you’ll be able to call them on it with confidence!
