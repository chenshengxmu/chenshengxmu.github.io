Indeed, Apple makes altering the look of the watch face an easy task. In this basic Apple Watch tutorial, we show you how easy it is to change your watch face in seconds.

* You must first be on the watch face screen in order to change the watch face. To get back to the watch face screen, press the Digital Crown until you return to your watch face.
* Step 1: Force Touch (firmly press) the watch face until you see the customization interface
* Step 2: Swipe left or right to find a watch face that you want to use
* Step 3: Tap once on the watch face that you wish to use, and your Apple Watch will switch to that face
