* Instapaper, which has long been the go-to ‘read it later’ service for iOS users, updated its iPhone and iPad client today, bringing the app to version 5.1.5. The update brings about a number of new features and improvements.
* On the features side of things, 5.1.5 adds support for Instapaper’s ‘Daily’ trending story service, as well as a new Send to Amazon Kindle function. And as for improvements, it adds better AirPlay support, back gestures and more…
* Here are the full release notes:
* Instapaper is the simplest way to save and store articles for reading: offline, on-the-go, anytime, anywhere, perfectly formatted. Instapaper for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch provides a mobile-optimized Text view that makes reading Internet content a clean and uncluttered experience.
* * Instapaper Daily integration * Send to Kindle functionality (subscriber only) * Autorenewable subscriptions * Improved AirPlay integration * Fix back gestures with pagination enabled * Other minor enhancements 
* For right now, Pocket is still my favorite read-it-later app, but I consider Instapaper a solid alternative. And for power users, it offers a subscription service ($11.99 per year) that adds full text search, third party app support and more.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of Instapaper in the App Store for free.
