* According to China Times, the iPhone 5 is set to be released in the second week of September with an opening order of 4 million units. This speculation lines up with current predictions.
* According to suppliers, 400,000 trial units are currently being prepared. The news report goes on to say that the next generation iPad may be delayed until Thanksgiving due to component shortages…
* There has been a shroud of mystery surrounding the features and appearance of the iPhone 5, but recent leaked case designs suggest a curved, tapered down look— while others have said that it will resemble the iPhone 4 design.
* While the track record of the China Times has been a little shady, they do seem to be close to Apple’s suppliers in China and could very well have knowledge of the production plans. Reuters had reported eariler that the iPhone 5 would have a September release and start production in July.
