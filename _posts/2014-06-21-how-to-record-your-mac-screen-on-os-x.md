* I was recently streaming the Stanley Cup Finals and waiting for a new Apple commercial to air during the first period. Looking for a solution to record the TV ad, as it was not up on YouTube yet, I discovered a simple feature built right into QuickTime for recording your screen on Mac.
* Forget using third-party software or other cumbersome tools for recording your screen, and read ahead for step-by-step instructions on how to record your screen on Mac using QuickTime…
* Step 1: Open QuickTime.
* Step 2: In the Menu Bar, click on File > New Screen Recording (^⌘N).
* Step 3: Click on the red circular record button.

* Step 4: Click to record the whole screen, or drag on the screen using your mouse to record a specific area.
* Step 5: When you’re done recording, simply click on the Recording icon in the right end of your Menu Bar.
* Step 6: At that point, you can save your recording to your computer.
* If you are looking to record your iPhone screen instead, Apple has introduced a new feature in macOS that lets you record an iOS device with a Lightning cable in very similar fashion to this. There are also similar options available via AirPlay Mirroring if you have a jailbroken device.
