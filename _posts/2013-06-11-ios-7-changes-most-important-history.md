* Love it or hate it, Apple’s newly-unveiled iOS 7 will breathe new life into the aging iPhone, argued one analyst late Monday. Unlike hardware changes which have a short lifetime in terms of public curiosity, phone software updates are mesmerizing.
* In a note to investors, Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster writes that the changes within iOS 7 will spark renewed interest in the iPhone, which some felt was being overshadowed by its Android rivals, such as the Samsung Galaxy S4…
* Per CNET, Munster wrote:
* We believe iOS 7 is a reason for users to get excited about their iPhones again by giving it a new feel, which is something that we believe has been lacking in the past iOS updates and subsequently device launches, regardless of hardware design.
* The most visible change to Apple’s mobile software update is a ‘flat’ design of the user interface, a switch championed by the firm’s design guru, Jony Ive. Since 2007, the iPhone has followed a more life-like design philosophy held by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and the former iOS chief Scott Forstall.

* Unlike hardware changes, which iPhone owners shrug off after just a few hours, “the OS is what mesmerizes people longer term,” according to the analyst.
* Mesmerize or anger.
* While over half of readers who take part in our informal iOS 7 makeover poll said they loved the new design, nearly a third described the new interface as polarizing and will need getting used to.
* Designers should also love the changes.

* Not only is ‘flat’ in vogue, but reversing all the psychic damage from the iO7 facelift will likely mean an upsurge in business. Indeed, Dribble, a popular online hangout for designers, is featuring a number of makeovers of the new iOS 7 home screen.
* It is almost a certainty that we’ll see hacks to rollback the ‘flat’ UI.
* Despite the power of iOS, Munster couldn’t resist predicting new hardware, such as a low-cost iPhone and the iWatch over the next 18 months. Naturally, we couldn’t have a Munster analysis without the latest timeline on the mythical Apple TV set.
* Specifically, he’s calling for the budget iPhone in September or October and a standalone Apple television set by year’s end. He’s also expecting an iWatch and an iPhablet, both some time in 2014.
