* NewTabSearch is a well thought-out jailbreak tweak that forces Mobile Safari to open a new tab for each new search that’s performed via the bult-in search box.
* It’s even smart enough to know not to open a new tab when you perform the same search. Check inside for a full video synopsis of NewTabSearch…
* I don’t know how many times I’ve lost a page that I was viewing simply because I wanted to perform a search, but this is a tweak that will resolve that problem going forward.
* NewTabSearch can be downloaded for free on Cydia if you have a jailbroken device running iOS 4 or higher.
* I think this should be a default option in Safari, what about you?
