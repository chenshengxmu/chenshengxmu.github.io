* Apple on Monday made the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 11.3, tvOS 11.3, and macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 updates available to developers. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s developer center, or by using each platform’s OTA updating mechanism.
* iOS 11.3 is a fairly significant update with 4 new Animoji characters, new battery health and management features, ARKit improvements, and much more. Check out our hands-on video with beta 3 below.

* tvOS 11.3 is a little more tame, focused mainly on bug fixes and security improvements. It does however include Match Content enhancements, automatic frame rate switching on Apple TV 4, and support for AirPlay 2 (although Apple pulled support for AirPlay 2 in beta3). Check out our demo video below.
* Apple says macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 includes bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as support for new iOS 11.3 features like Messages on iCloud and Business Chat, but not much else. Wallpaper fans, however, will be happy to hear it does include the smoky iMac Pro background.
* As usual, if anything new pops up in today’s betas, we’ll be sure to pass it along. And if you happen to come across something noteworthy that we’ve missed, feel free to tell us about it down in the comments below.
