* I known we’ve had enough of uninspiring iPhone 7 mockups. Also, dummy iPhone cases like this one are a dime a dozen on Chinese sites like Ali Express as vendors have always been eager to produce rumor-based iPhone housings to gain free press.
* That said, the 4K video you’re about to see offers a different look at three iPhone 7 dummies—one is 4.7-inch and the other two are 5.5 inches—in line with questionable rumors that Apple could ship two different versions of the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.
* Because the video is in 4K resolution and as such provides a good look at the iPhone 7’s supposed iPhone 6s-like design, we’re posting it here for the sake of discussion.
* Here’s that clip.
* Don’t forget to click the embedded video’s settings menu to select 4K resolution, and then go full screen to enjoy it on your 5K iMac.
* Again, these are simply mockups that someone created from unconfirmed iPhone 7 rumors that have been swirling around for months now. The video was posted to YouTube by an account thank links to a third-party Japanese iPhone reservation store.

* If you need another proof that these “iPhones” are dummies, look no further than the the model number “A1429” that identifies an iPhone 5 model, though the lack of Apple fit and finish and plasticky side buttons also give them away, so there’s that.
