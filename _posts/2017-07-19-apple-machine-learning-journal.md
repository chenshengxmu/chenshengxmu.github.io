* Hosted at machinelearning.apple.com, Apple’s new blog called “Machine Learning Journal” is dedicated to sharing technical details of its machine learning research with the AI community.
* Posts written by Apple engineers detail their work using machine learning technologies “to help build innovative products for millions of people around the world.”
* The first blog entry, titled “Improving the Realism of Synthetic Images”, covers a method for improving the realism of synthetic images from a simulator using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information.
* Apple’s reluctance to share its artificial intelligence research and various machine learning endeavors publicly, according to some people, hurt its recruiting efforts and its ability to iterate Siri and advance AI projects at a faster clip.
* With that in mind, the new blog is another step in the right direction, especially after the company began allowing its machine learning researchers to publicly share their findings.
* Last December, the iPhone maker shared its very first AI research paper.
