* Remember that little feature we showed you with the OS X Messages beta that let you send files to your iDevice straight from the desktop?
* Imagine that, but imagine it about 50 times better. That’s what you get with the upcoming jailbreak tweaks entitled SendAny and ReceiveAny — they allow you to send and receive any type of file using iMessage.
* Check inside for our full hands-on preview of both tweaks in action…
* SendAny, as its name might suggest, allows you to send any file type from your device’s native file structure. It uses a Finder-esque file browser that allows you to peruse your device’s entire uninhibited file directory.
* ReceiveAny, on the other hand, is the tweak that allows your device to receive files types that are normally unsupported.
* With both tweaks installed along with an iMessage account, you can send and receive files of any type to an OS X desktop with the Messages beta, or to another jailbroken device with the same tweaks installed.
* There’s also built in DropBox support for the times when you want to take your file sharing to the cloud.
* Once released on Cydia, ReceiveAny will be a free download, while SendAny will set you back $1.99.
* Truth to be told, that is a cheap price to pay for the flexibility that this tweak brings to the table. It makes sharing to any other iDevice simply effortless, and makes sharing with the desktop an easy affair as well.
* Again the tweak is still in development, but should be appearing on Cydia in the near future. What do you think?
