* Home screen setups vary from one person to the next, but if yours is more cluttered than most, then perhaps you could benefit from a new free jailbreak tweak release called LeadMeHome by iOS developer LonestarX.
* LeadMeHome aims to help you find app icons on your Home screen more efficiently. Whether you want to launch, move, or delete the app in question, LeadMeHome saves you the time and hassle of searching several pages’ worth of app icons with a fine-toothed comb.
* Using LeadMeHome is straightforward; just type the name of the app you want to find in the Spotlight search bar and then tap and hold on the corresponding search result. Pro tip: don’t use a 3D Touch gesture – merely tap and hold.
* Upon doing so, your device instantly finds the app icon on your Home screen for you. The icon temporarily animates and glows red to grab your attention before returning to its normal state, as shown above. And before you ask… yes, it can find icons inside of folders too.
* LeadMeHome adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure a few options:

* LeadMeHome may come in handy if you have more Home screen pages than you can count on your own two hands, but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone with only a couple of pages’ worth of apps installed.
* If you’re interested in trying LeadMeHome for yourself, then you can download it for free today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices.
