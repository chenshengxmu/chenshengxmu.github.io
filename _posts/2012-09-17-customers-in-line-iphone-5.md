* If you weren’t able to place your iPhone 5 pre-order last week, and still want to pick one up on launch day, I have some good news and some bad news for you.
* The good news is, Apple and other retailers will start offering the handset this Friday at 8 AM. The bad news is, it looks like some folks are already lining up…
* Fortune reports that an iPhone 5 line has formed outside of Apple’s Fifth Avenue store in New York City. Folks started showing up around 8AM last Thursday.
* Now, waiting outside for 8 days for a phone to launch sounds pretty extreme, but it sounds like these folks are hoping for more than a handset. Out of the seven people that Fortune talked to, six of them were there for promotional purposes.
* A couple of the guys are hoping to get exposure for their new social media startup. And there’s also a few musicians. And then of course there are some folks in line hoping to either sell their place, or sell the iPhone 5 to folks with less patience.
* Waiting in line for new Apple products has become quite the cliche over the past few years. So much so, in fact, that Samsung uses them as a setting for its TV spots.
* But if waiting out in the elements for days isn’t really your thing, as aforementioned, the iPhone 5 goes on sale this Friday, at several retailers, at 8AM local time.
