* If you have both an iPhone and an iPad, then you should already know that each device’s Camera app has a different look and feel to it.
* The iPad’s Camera app interface is built with a larger display in mind, making some tools more readily accessible. On the other hand, many use their iPhone for photography more often and would prefer having the same familiar experience on their iPad.
* Enter a new free jailbreak tweak called iPhone Cam for iPad by iOS developer Adel Hammoud. As the name implies, this tweak ports the iPhone-style Camera user interface to your jailbroken iPad so that the photography experience feels one and the same across your devices.
* After you install the tweak, you should notice a difference in the way your iPad’s Camera app looks immediately. It does away with the side-based controls and moves them to the top and bottom of the screen instead, just like on your iPhone.
* The tweak also unlocks the live filters that Apple disables on iPads by default, letting you get the most out of your tablet photography without needing third-party filtering apps to perform similar tasks:

* If you’re used to the way the iPad’s Camera app already looks, then this tweak could be a polarizing experience for you. While it won’t be for everyone, iPhone Cam for iPad will get the job done if you’ve always wanted an iPhone-style Camera app on your iPad.
* For years, I’ve always stood behind tweaks that port features from one device to another because it puts all kinds of options on the table for jailbreakers. Whether the iPhone Camera UI makes photography easier on the iPad is a moot point, but your mileage will vary depending on your photography technique and which interface you prefer using.
* If you’re interested in giving iPhone Cam for iPad a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t come with any options to configure and works with all jailbroken iPads running iOS 10.
* Which Camera interface do you prefer on your iPad? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.
