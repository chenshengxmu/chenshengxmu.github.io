* Apple analyst Gene Munster—the guy who has been predicting a full-on television set with a shiny Apple logo on it for well over five years before admitting he was terribly wrong—is back!
* In a note to clients, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, the Piper Jaffray analyst is calling for an ‘S-upgrade’ to the Apple Watch this Spring.
* In sticking to its annual upgrade cycle Apple will now make an S-version of the wrist-worn device, reasons Munster. If he’s right, that would constitute borrowing a page from the iPhone’s book.
* As you know, iPhones recycle same design with so-called S-upgrades that focus on hardware advanced every other year. This Spring, Munster posits, the Apple Watch will receive refreshed internals like faster chips, packed inside enclosures unchanged from existing watches.
* “Expect more of an ‘S’ version with similar design, upgraded components including processor, battery and new band styles,” wrote Munster. According to the note, the device is “unlikely to have a wireless radio,” which would allow the Apple Watch to function on its own when decoupled from its paired iPhone.
* For what it’s worth, 9to5Mac’s reliable Mark Gurman said this morning that Apple will hold a media event on March 15 which will serve as a launchpad for a third-generation iPad Air, an ‘iPhone 5se’ and some new Apple Watch band options, but he’s not expecting a new Apple Watch hardware until September.
* I’m not really sure if I should make anything out of Munster’s report or not, but I really want to hear your take on Munster’s analyst report.
* Care to comment?
