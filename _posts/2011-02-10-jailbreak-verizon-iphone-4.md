* It’s official, the Verizon iPhone is here for everyone to purchase and go home with. If you just got your hands on one of them, the first thing you might want to do is to jailbreak your Verizon iPhone.
* Not sure what jailbreaking is and why you should do it? Make sure to read our explanation of jailbreaking, and the reasons why you would want to jailbreak the Verizon iPhone. If you’re still on the fence after reading this because you worry the FBI might bust down your door for jailbreaking your iPhone, know that jailbreaking is 100% legal, at least here in the US.
* This being said, this guide will show you how to jailbreak a Verizon iPhone running iOS 4.2.6 using GreenPois0n…
* Step 1: Download GreenPois0n RC5 b4 from our iPhone downloads section.
* Step 2: Make sure your iPhone is plugged in to your computer via the USB cable.
* Step 3: Launch GreenPois0n and click “Jailbreak”.
* Step 4: Follow the instructions that appear on your screen in order to put your iPhone in DFU mode:
* Step 5: GreenPois0n will now inject the jailbreak. Wait a little bit.
* Step 6: Once the process is done, go to your home screen and you should see a new icon for “Loader”. Launch Loader and install Cydia from there, then reboot your iPhone.
* Done! Your Verizon iPhone should now be fully jailbroken and you can install third party applications directly from Cydia. Make sure to check our extensive list of jailbreak apps.
