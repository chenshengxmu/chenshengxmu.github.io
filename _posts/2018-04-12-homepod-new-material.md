* A future HomePod iteration should not leave ring marks on treated wood furniture.
* Following reports from HomePod buyers who complained that the $349 Siri-powered speaker leaves marks on wood furniture, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman mentioned in today’s story that the Cupertino technology giant is hoping to rectify the situation “with a new material.”
* The report stopped short of detailing this mystery material.
* Back in February, reports began popping up from customers who said their HomePod discolors wood. When the Siri speaker is placed on a treated wooden surface, a pale ring-shaped mark apparently develops beneath its silicone base within as little as 20 minutes.
* Other surfaces like glass aren’t affected.
* Apple responded by posting a support document headlined “Cleaning and Taking Care of HomePod,” with a section entitled “Where to Place HomePod.”
* “It is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces,” the document reads. “The marks can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the table surface, and will often go away after several days when the speaker is removed from the wooden surface.”
* The company advises wiping the marks gently with a soft damp or dry cloth or cleaning the area using the furniture manufacturer’s recommended process. “If you’re concerned about this, we recommend placing your HomePod on a different surface,” the document suggests.
* Bottom line: Apple is likely going to replace the speaker’s silicone base with “a new material” to prevent HomePod from discoloring wooden surfaces.
* Thoughts?
