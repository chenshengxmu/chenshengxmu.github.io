* Mailbox has updated its popular iOS email client this afternoon, bringing the app to version 2.1. The update is fairly significant, as it adds new spam options, Passbook support, and support for several new languages.
* With 2.1, it’s now possible to print your emails, mark them as spam or unread, and favorite them by clicking on the three little dots at the top of a thread view. You can also now add items directly to the Passbook app…
* Here are your release notes:
* What’s New in Version 2.1 – Now translated into 19 languages, including Chinese (both Simplified and Traditional), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Spanish (both European and Latin American), Swedish, Thai and English – View spam and mark messages as spam – Passbook support – Permanent delete from trash and spam – Bug fixes and performance improvements
* Additionally, Mailbox can now delete emails for good when you empty your trash, and supports the standard 24-hour clock. So those that prefer a super clean inbox and military time will feel more at home with the client.
* If you’re not familiar with Mailbox, it’s a gesture-based email client that supports services like Gmail, iCloud and Yahoo. It constantly makes our lists of top iOS email apps, and they are currently working on a Mac version.
* As usual, you can find the latest version of the Mailbox app for free in the App Store.
