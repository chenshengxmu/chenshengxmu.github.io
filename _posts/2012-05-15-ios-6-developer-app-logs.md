* According to a new report from 9to5Mac, developers are starting to see iOS 6 code strings in their app logs, signaling that Apple is currently testing the software’s compatibility with App Store applications.
* This would seem to confirm earlier reports that the company is set to unveil the latest iteration of its mobile operating system during a keynote presentation at its WWDC event next month…
* Last year, Apple managed to add more than 200 new features to iOS 5, giving folks literally hundreds of reasons to upgrade. And all eyes are on the iPad-makers this summer to see what they’ve managed to cook up this time around.
* Other than a revamped Maps application, little else is known about what’s on the menu for iOS 6. Folks are clamoring for features like third-party widget support and a redesigned home screen, but it’s unclear if those will make the cut.
