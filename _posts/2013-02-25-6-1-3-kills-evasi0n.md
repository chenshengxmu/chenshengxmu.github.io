* We knew that the fun wouldn’t last forever, and it looks like the vulnerabilities used for the evasi0n jailbreak will be fixed in an upcoming iOS update. PlanetBeing, one of the founding members of the evad3rs team that brought us the long awaited iOS 6.x untethered jailbreak, reports that Apple has patched one of the five exploits that evasi0n uses to accomplish the jailbreak.
* PlanetBeing, known as David Wang among close associates, briefly sat down with Forbes writer Andy Greenberg, and confirmed what everyone knew was inevitable. The evasi0n jailbreak will most likely be patched in iOS 6.1.3.
* It is indeed sad, but that’s the way this cat and mouse game between Apple and the hackers behind some of the brilliant jailbreaks, has worked since the very beginning.
* While PlanetBeing is still investigating the full scope of the fixes, he seemed pretty confident in Apple’s diligence to stamp out more than just one of the bugs that the exploit uses:
* “If one of the vulnerabilities doesn’t work, evasi0n doesn’t work,” he says. “We could replace that part with a different vulnerability, but [Apple] will probably fix most if not all of the bugs we’ve used when 6.1.3 comes out.”
* Will iOS 6.1.3 be the nail in the coffin for evasi0n? The verdict is still out for that, but it’s certainly not looking very good. At any rate, we’ve had more than enough time to take advantage of the jailbreak, as Apple has taken its sweet time when it comes to providing a patch. With previous jailbreaks, the turnaround time for a fix has been much shorter.
* Our advice? Just enjoy the jailbreak, back up your SHSH blobs in case a downgrade solution becomes available, and remain confident in the abilities of the genius hackers who are responsible for this and future exploits. Oh, and obviously, stay away from iOS 6.1.3 once it is released.
* What do you think? Are you surprised it’s taken Apple this long to patch evasi0n?
