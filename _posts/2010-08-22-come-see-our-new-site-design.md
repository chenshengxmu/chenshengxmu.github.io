* We were way overdue for a site redesign! As you can see it’s much better than it was before. That’s because instead of doing the design myself, I actually hired a professional to do it. The layout is pretty much the same so you should find your way around pretty easily.
* There are Twitter and Facebook buttons on every page so you can easily share the articles with your buddies. We also have a new logo, which I really like.
* We kept the same amount of ads, no more no less (actually, there is less on the homepage). There are quite a few ads on the site but I make sure they never get in the way of the content. So when you read an article, you will never have an ad in the middle of it. My goal in the next few months is to have less and less ads on the blog. It’s not going to be easy but we’ll get there.
* A site redesign is like a rebirth. It’s also a good way to thank all those who make this possible: YOU! Thank you for reading iDB. Thank you for being part of our growing community and thank you for spreading the love to your friends and family. The site has grown very quickly and I am extremely proud of where we’re at and where we’re going to.
* Now I hope we didn’t do all this in vain and that you will love the redesign as much as I do.
* Please leave a comment to tell us what you think.
