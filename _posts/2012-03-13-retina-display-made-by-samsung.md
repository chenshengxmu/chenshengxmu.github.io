* In the months leading up to the unveiling of the new iPad, the rumor mill seemed pretty confident that the tablet would be getting a high resolution Retina display. But we weren’t quite sure who was going to be making them.
* There was a lot of speculation regarding Sharp as a possible manufacturer. And the same with LG. But according to a new report from Bloomberg, the sole display-maker for the new iPad has been none other than Samsung…
* That’s right, Samsung — the company currently involved in more than a dozen lawsuits around the globe with Apple over patent infringement. Hey Apple, if you don’t want Samsung stealing your ideas, stop having them build your products.
* But from the sounds of things, Apple didn’t have much of a choice in the matter this time. Here’s an excerpt from the Bloomberg article:
* “Achieving this high resolution without compromising on the power consumption and brightness and maintaing Apple’s quality standards are supposedly proving to be a challenge for LG Display and Sharp.”
* With a resolution of 2048 x 1536, the iPad’s screen is the sharpest of any tablet on the market — by a fairly large margin. But given that Samsung is making the displays, it wouldn’t surprise us to see a similar one pop up in the next Galaxy Tab.
* We’ve certainly heard the saying, “keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.” But any closer, and Samsung would be in Apple’s R&D labs.
