* Folks hoping to score one of Apple’s new iPhones on the cheap may want to check out T-Mobile. The carrier has announced its pricing for the smartphones, which will allow customers to get an iPhone 5c for as little as $0 down, and the iPhone 5s for as little as $99 down.
* Of course, those are just the up front costs. You’ll have to pay off the rest of the device via monthly payments. The 16GB iPhone 5c, for example, will cost you $22 per month for 24 months, and the 16GB iPhone 5s will require you to make 24 monthly payments of $22.91…
* Still, that equals out to be about a $20 discount off the standard iPhone 5c price, and even the 5s model is a few dollars cheaper than what Apple charges. And don’t forget, T-Mobile is one of the few US carriers still offering unlimited data—plans start at just $50 per month.

* As with other carriers and retailers, T-Mobile will begin offering pre-orders for the iPhone 5c on Friday, September 13 at 12:01 am Pacific Time. The iPhone 5s, however, will not be available for pre-order, but it can be purchased from the provider starting on September 20.
