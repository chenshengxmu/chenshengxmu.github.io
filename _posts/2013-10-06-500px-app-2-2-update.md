* Popular photo-sharing service 500px has posted a significant update for its iOS client this weekend. The release, which brings the app to version 2.2, includes an all-new visual design and new swipe gestures.
* The new translucent edge-to-edge design makes the app’s interface more streamlined and accentuates high resolution photos. And the new swipe gestures help you quickly perform actions like ‘Like’ and ‘Reply.’
* Here are your 2.2 release notes:
* • A beautiful new translucent edge-to-edge design filling your screen with amazing images. Your photos always come first. • Swipe any comment to reveal Like and Reply actions. Like a comment to promote it to the Top Comments section; reply to a comment to keep the discussion alive. • iPad: See the community in action with an improved photo details drawer which shows each person who liked and favorited every photo. • iPad: Flow gets even more personal with all of your friends’ avatars alongside their likes, favorites, and comments.
* I’ve always been a huge fan of the 500px app, and it gets even better with version 2.2. The entire app looks better, and actually feels easier to use, and the new ‘Reply’ and ‘Like’ swipe gestures are very convenient.
* For those interested, the 500px service comes in three flavors: a free version that lets you upload 20 photos per month, and $25/year and $75/year options with more features. And you can download the app here.
