* Those looking to purchase an iPhone in the near future might want to make it a point to check out the prices at their local Target. 9to5Mac is reporting that the retailer is knocking $50 off both 4 and 4S models for all carriers.
* This brings the iPhone 4S down to $150 — in line with discounts being offered by regional carriers, and the iPhone 4 down to just $50. And apparently, Target’s not the only chain dropping the prices on the popular handsets…
* iLounge notes that RadioShack has just announced an identical sale, knocking $50 off of both iPhone 4 and 4S models. The discounts are good for 8GB and 16GB versions on all carriers, and require you to sign a new two-year contract.
* Although it’s unclear how long Target’s sale will go on, RadioShack says that it plans to offer the discounts through the end of June. These kind of sales don’t come along very often, so it’s recommended that you jump on it while you can.
* What do you think? Deal or no deal?
