* If you do a lot of running or jogging, then you probably find your iPhone in your pocket while you listen to your favorite motivational music.
* Unless you have a meticulously designed playlist, chances are you’ll run into a song or an artist that you don’t immediately recognize. Instead of pulling your phone out of your pocket mid stride, wouldn’t it be nice if your iPhone could tell you all about the song itself?
* With MediaSpeak, now it can. Check out our video demonstration or the details…
* MediaSpeak is a free jailbreak tweak that will speak the track and artist name of the next song that begins playing. That way you can keep your mind on the task at hand, without feeling compelled to glance at your iPhone’s screen.
* In the video I demonstrated it with the stock Music app, but I’m happy to report that it works with 3rd party apps like Pandora as well.
* MediaSpeak can be downloaded for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
