* Good news today for folks still hunting for holiday gifts. If the person, or people, on your list own an iPad or another tablet, we might just have the perfect accessory bundle for you featuring the Just Mobile Slide Stand and AluPen Stylus.
* The bundle includes a Slide Stand, an AluPen—both of which have won iF Product Design Awards—and an AluCube for holding the stylus. All 3 products are made of high quality aluminum and being offered at a discount for a limited time…
* Here’s a breakdown of everything included in the package:

* Purchased individually, these items would normally cost you $90. Just Mobile typically sells the Slide Stand for $40, the AluPen+AluCube together for $40, and then the cost of shipping. But Stack Social is offering the 3 items for just $59.99.
* Unfortunately, the promotion is only available to folks in the continental US and there’s no refunds. But on the bright side, shipping is included in the aforementioned price tag. For more information on this deal, or to redeem it, click here.
