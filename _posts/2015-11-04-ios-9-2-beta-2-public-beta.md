* If you’re signed on for the Apple Beta Software Program, you can now take iOS 9.2 beta 2, which was released yesterday, for a spin on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* The second beta of the forthcoming iOS 9.2 software update delivers additional fixes and enhancements for the Apple Watch, Audio, Networking and Safari, while enabling AT&T Wi-Fi Calling on the Mac.
* To apply an over-the-air update to your iOS device, go to Settings → General → Software Update and follow the onscreen instructions. You can apply for Apple’s Beta Software Program here to gain access to public beats of iOS and OS X.

* As detailed earlier this morning, iOS 9.2 beta 2 expands the usefulness of Wi-Fi Calling with support for AT&T’s network-level technology called NumberSync which lets you place and receive phone calls from your Mac running OS X 10.11.2 beta 2, even if your iPhone is turned off.
