* Everyone has a favorite web browser they prefer to use on their computer, but when it comes to the iPhone or iPad, Apple forces all URL links to open in Safari by default.
* You can change this with a new free jailbreak tweak called BrowserChanger10 by iOS developer HiDaN, which lets you choose a new default web browser for opening URL links.
* Upon installation, the tweak adds a preferences pane to the Settings app for configuring a handful of options:

* Right off the bat, you’ll find a kill switch for toggling the tweak on or off. Underneath, you’ll see two additional cell selectors. In the first, you can pick a new default web browser for opening URL links. Among the web browsers you can choose as your default are:
* The second cell selector lets you override your new default web browser settings. Apps you enable from this list will continue to launch links via Safari as usual, which can be useful when you experience compatibility issues with your preferred browser in niche circumstances.
* If you use a web browser not shown in the list above, then the tweak unfortunately doesn’t support it. On the other hand, you can always request support from the tweak developer via the support email link in Cydia.
* BrowserChanger10 is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. While the concept behind changing the default web browser on your iOS device isn’t new, BrowserChanger10 is the latest edition to the lineup of tweaks that can do it, and it works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
