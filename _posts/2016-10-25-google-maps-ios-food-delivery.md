* Google Maps for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch yesterday received an interesting update in the App Store. The new version brings out a few enhancements such as integration with popular food delivery services, support for plus codes—identifiers for locations that don’t have their own street address—and other perks. These new features require Google Maps 4.24 for iOS or later, which can be downloaded free of charge from the App Store.
* Food delivery integration lets you order food from your favorite restaurant.
* Just search for a restaurant in Google Maps and you’ll see a new “Place an order” option above its phone number and below the menu, provided the place works with GrubHub, Seamless, EatStreet, Eat 24 or one of the other major online delivery services.
* Tapping the link takes you to the delivery service’s website or app, if installed, to complete your order. Ordering from food delivery services is not available in all countries, with availability varying from city to city.
* Next, you can now find plus codes by dropping a pin anywhere in the world. Plus codes, as per Google, let you explore places that lack an easy number-and-street identifier.
* To share a location without a specific street address, drop a pin anywhere, swipe up the location card and tap the code to copy it to the system clipboard, then share the URL with friends and family.
* You can find the plus code for your location at http://plus.codes.
* In addition to the aforesaid new features, the refreshed app comes with bug fixes and provides a more streamlined way of taking and adding photos of places: to take a new image or upload an existing image from your Photos library, tap an “Add a photo” option below the existing shots.
* Download Google Maps for free from the App Store.
