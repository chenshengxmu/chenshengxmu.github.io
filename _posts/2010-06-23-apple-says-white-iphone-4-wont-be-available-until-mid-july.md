* Those of you who are waiting for the White iPhone 4 shouldn’t hold their breath. Apple just released a short statement in which it says the White iPhone won’t be available until mid July.
* White models of Apple’s new iPhone 4 have proven more challenging to manufacture than expected, and as a result they will not be available until the second half of July. The availability of the more popular iPhone 4 black models is not affected.
* Now why is it harder to make an iPhone in white? I have no idea but it seems to me the color is not the issue here and that Apple is facing other challenges they’d rather not disclose.
* At any rates, now you know that if you want a White iPhone 4, you’re going to have to wait another month. Is that another “fail” to add to the list of this iPhone 4 launch?
