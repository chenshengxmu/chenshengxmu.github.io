* Apple just announced iCloud Drive, which allows you to store files directly into iCloud and synchronize them in folders across your Macs and iOS devices, and even Windows machines.
* iCloud Drive will allow you to access not only the personal files that you wish to sync, but it will also allow you to access files from apps synced with iCloud, even if those apps are from iOS devices.

* Apple is also introducing a new document picker in iOS 8, which will let you access all of your iCloud Drive files from a central location. Weâ€™ll have more about iOS 8 in the very near future, so stay tuned, and let us know how excited you are about iCloud Drive.
