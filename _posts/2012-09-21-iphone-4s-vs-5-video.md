* It’s been a big day so far, but we’re not finished yet. Continuing on with our iPhone 5 coverage, we’ve come across a new clip that compares the video quality of the new handset with its predecessor.
* Now, since the 5 uses the same 8MP camera sensor as the 4S, you’d think that video quality would be the same. But just as we discovered with still photos, there is a noticeable difference between the two…

* MacRumors points to the above clip from YouTube user f1ipzid3 that shows a side-by-side comparison of the video recording quality of the iPhone 4S and 5. He says that both phones were handheld on top of one another to show an “equal comparison,” and that the video has not been altered beyond cropping.
* Though it’s not extremely noticeable, you can tell a difference in the iPhone 5’s video quality in the indoor and outdoor, and stability tests. Colors seem brighter, especially in low light, on the 5.
* But as for FaceTime video quality, there’s a much more obvious difference. Thanks to a bump in the front-facing sensor, the iPhone 5’s FaceTime camera shoots much sharper video than the 4S.
* Stay tuned for more of our iPhone 5 coverage.
* What do you think of the comparison clip? Do you think the 5 is noticeably better than the 4S?
