* Apple on Tuesday seeded the third beta for iOS 9.3.3 to both developers and public testers. The beta can be installed via the over-the-air update mechanism in iOS, or it can be downloaded from either Apple’s dev center or the Beta Software Program website.
* The update comes two weeks after the second iOS 9.3.3 beta was released, and it’s mostly bug fixes. Apple is obviously trying to iron out a few remaining bugs in iOS 9.3 so it can turn its attention to iOS 10, which arrived in beta form last week during WWDC.
* In addition to iOS, Apple also seeded new betas for tvOS and OS X on Tuesday. The betas are available to registered developers and testers, and can be installed via OTA in tvOS for those with the latest beta profile, and then the Update tab in the Mac App Store.
* OS X 10.11.6 and tvOS 9.2.2 are also minor updates, featuring mostly bug fixes and improvements. Again it seems like Apple is just looking to tighten things up as it moves on to the next versions. macOS Sierra and tvOS 10 debuted last week, and will launch this fall.
