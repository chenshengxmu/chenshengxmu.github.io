* There’ve been a lot of haptic feedback-based jailbreak tweaks released in my day, but EinsteinVibes by iOS developer LacertosusDeus is one of the first I’ve seen that brings haptic feedback to the stock Calculator app in iOS.
* EinstienVibes harnesses the power of Apple’s Taptic Engine to provide Calculator app users with a subtle vibration each time they tap on any of the app’s buttons.
* In our testing, EinsteinVibes offers an enjoyable experience akin to using a real calculator with tactile buttons, but it doesn’t seem to work on handsets without the Taptic Engine such as the iPhone 6 and earlier. We chalk this up to a simple hardware incompatibility in which the tweak depends on Apple’s newer hardware to function.
* Depending on how often you use the Calculator app on your device instead of merely asking Siri to do your math homework for you, the tweak might be worth installing. This is especially the case if you already use an arsenal of other haptic feedback-related tweaks and want to spread such functionality to your stock Calculator app.
* If you’re interested in trying EinsteinVibes for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Packix repository.
* The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 11 iPhones and doesn’t come with any options to configure. Additionally, those interested in learning how the tweak works can view its source code on the developer’s GitHub page.
* Do you think haptic feedback compliments the Calculator interface in iOS? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
