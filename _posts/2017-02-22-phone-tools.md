* With a new free toolbox-like jailbreak tweak called Phone Tools by Justin Petkovic, you can customize your Phone app’s user interface to your liking by disabling and/or removing the features you could care less about.
* Similar tweak concepts have already been implemented for apps like Camera and Photos, but this is the first time we’re seeing one for the Phone app in iOS 10.
* After installation, you can head over to the Settings app where you will find a new preferences pane to manage all of your settings:

* Here, you get all of the following options:
* At the bottom of the preferences pane is a button to respring and save your changes.
* I find that hiding the Favorites tab is the most useful for me, simply because I never save favorite contacts (I hate everyone equally). On the other hand, those who have no SIM card or use their older iPhone simply as a Wi-Fi communications device really have no use for the Voicemail tab either.
* I also find that having these additional options for filtering third-party app clutter from the Phone app is a nice feature, as some people don’t want to see all of their important phone calls getting mixed into the bunch with a ton of history items from other apps that may not be as important to them.
* Among all of the settings, there are a number of ways the tweak can be configured, so no matter how you use your own Phone app uniquely from anyone else, there’s bound to be a setting or two in here that you might like.
* If you’re interested in giving Phone Tools a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices and is designed only for iPhones.
