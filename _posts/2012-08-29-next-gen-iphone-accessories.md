* We’re just weeks away from Apple’s next-gen iPhone event, and the leaked parts just keep on coming. This time it’s a wall charger, USB cable and a case — all of which appear to be made for the handset and its rumored smaller dock connector.
* For the first time since its inception, Apple is widely expected to change the dock connector on its iPhone this fall. Instead of the usual 30-pin setup, it’s said to be utilizing a smaller, 8-pin connector that we’ll also see in future iOS products…

* The leaked accessories, originally posted by iLounge, seem to match up with previous mini dock connector parts. There’s a total of three parts in the two pictures, all made by Scosche, including a a dual device wall charger, a USB cable and a case.
* The wall charger looks pretty standard, albeit its ability to charge two devices at once. But there’s something unique about the USB cable. Its plug can transform from a standard micro USB connector to the new Apple connector, and vice versa.
* Finally, the case in the photo is said to also be for the next-gen iPhone, and is shown with an iPhone 4S for reference. Notice how it has a much smaller opening for the new dock connector, as well as seemingly large holes for the mic and speakers.
* I don’t think there’s any question at this point that Apple is introducing an all-new dock connector next month, starting with the new iPhone. The good news is, there will be an adapter for older 30-pin accessories, so you shouldn’t have to toss them all out.
