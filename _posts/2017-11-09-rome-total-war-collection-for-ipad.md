* Celebrating the first anniversary of the original Rome: Total War for iPad, developer Feral Interactive on Thursday unveiled its Rome: Total War Collection iPad bundle containing the game itself as well as two content packs: “Barbarian Invasion” and “Alexander”.
* Originally developed for PCs by The Creative Assembly and released in 2004 by Activision, Rome: Total War is one of the best reviewed strategy titles of all time. The iOS edition of the game contains no In-App Purchases.
* Here’s the original release trailer for the game.
* All three titles included in the bundle feature high-resolution Retina graphics, touch-optimized controls and mid-battle autosaves. The games support all iPad models from iPad mini 2, iPad Air and iPad Pro onward.
* Here’s what’s included in the bundle:
* If you already own some of the items from the bundle, use App Store’s “Complete My Bundle” feature to pay the difference between the bundle price and what you have already paid.
* Just a few days ago, Feral released Hitman: Game of the Year Edition for macOS and Linux that includes the stealth-action game with the complete first season, plus the Patient Zero mission pack and three new Escalation mission packs—The Raven Pack, The Cowboy Pack and The Clown Pack— each featuring its own suit, mission and a killer reward to add to your arsenal.
* Tuesday, Feral announced XCOM 2: War of the Chosen for macOS and Linux.
* ROME: Total War Collection is available for $16.99 from App Store.
