* Apple on Tuesday published a new tutorial video via its official channel on YouTube.

* You can send or receive money via Messages or by asking Siri. The new Apple Pay Cash iMessage app allows you to select who you want to pay along with the amount, then approve with Face ID or Touch ID. The money arrives instantly and securely in the Wallet app.
* Watch the video now to learn how Apple Pay makes going cashless effortless.
* The funds in your virtual Apple Pay Cash card can be withdrawn to a bank account or you can use them to pay for stuff you purchase in apps and stores with Apple Pay.
