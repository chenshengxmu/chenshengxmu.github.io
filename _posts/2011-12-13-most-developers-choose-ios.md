* Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt made some waves at the recent Paris-hosted Le Web conference with comments regarding Android and its iOS competitor. Schmidt was at the conference to talk about Android’s big update, Ice Cream Sandwich.
* During his speech, the CEO made a pretty big 6-month prediction for Google’s mobile platform, saying things like “developers will soon start choosing Android over iOS.” But a recent research report from Flurry Analytics suggests otherwise.
* According to the marketing research firm, 75% of all mobile software startups chose iOS last quarter. That number is up from 63% in Q1 of this year. Could there really be a 50+ point swing in the next 6 months? It doesn’t seem likely.

* So, why are developers choosing iOS over Android? On top of the huge fragmentation problem that plagues Google’s platform, it seems that money is also a major factor. According to Flurry’s research, Android developers make less than a quarter (24%) of what their iOS counterparts do.
* Keep in mind that Flurry’s research only accounts for 25% of all apps downloaded from the App Store and Android Market, so it doesn’t include every application. But a quarter of the market is still a sizable chunk to pull data from and the numbers can’t be that far off from the overall totals.
