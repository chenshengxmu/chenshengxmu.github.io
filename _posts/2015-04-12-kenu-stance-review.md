* From the makers of the Airframe, which I also considered the ‘perfect’ travel companion for car mounts, comes the Stance. Like the Airframe, Kenu designed their newest gadget to be amazingly simple and solve a problem most iPhone users would love to solve.
* Many times, I’m out and about, or even at home, and wish I could quickly find something to hold my iPhone in place. Whether FaceTime, Periscope, Netflix, or reading a recipe, Stance is there to help. I own a lot of docks and stands, at least in the double digits, but none of them are as small and versatile as Stance and I’m thankful Kenu sent one for review.
* Stance plugs directly into your iPhone’s Lightning port with the adapter, complete with locking indentions. Your iPhone is not going to wiggle its way free from the trademarked MicroMount attachment, made of a plastic-like composite material Kenu calls Grilamid. The MicroMount is a 360 degree pivoting ball to ensure iPhone rotates to the desired angle for your activity.
* Holding the MicroMount are three zinc-alloy constructed legs with non-slip TPE loaded feet. Conveniently, Stance can position your device in either landscape or portrait mode, as exampled in the video below.
* It is a highly simple device, with many use-cases and applications. Because it is extremely small, I simply slide Stance down into the penholder location in my day pack. That way, any time I could possibly need it, the device is waiting in my bag. It even has a built in bottle opener for those times you can’t find one elsewhere.
* Although this article is short and simple, it is not reflective of my positive opinion toward the Stance. Stance is an amazing little gadget that will make your iPhone life much easier. The device is made of quality materials. Sure aluminum would be nice, but the zinc alternative is the same to an untrained eye. It matches Space Gray almost exactly in color.

* Stance just feels solid, despite its tiny frame and small footprint. It is a little top heavy with a big iPhone 6 Plus, but it holds its own regardless. I highly recommend the Kenu Stance for anyone in the market for an iPhone dock or stand. For the photographers in the crowd, it can become an invaluable tool. With the new Apple Watch camera remote functionality, you can setup iPhone on the Stance and then snap the picture from your Watch!
* At $29.95 with free Amazon shipping, this seems like a no brainer. Are there cheaper alternatives? Sure. But, are they as well crafted with similar build materials? Probably not. I’m going to buy another one as a gift and maybe another for my second bag. Seriously, you should pick one up.
