* Over 100 million people are expected to gather in front of their television sets tomorrow to watch the Super Bowl. But for those of you that, for one reason or another, can’t get in front of a TV set, there are a few other ways to catch the Big Game.
* If you’re going to have access to a computer, you can watch it there. The game will be streamed live via FoxSportsGo.com. No computer? No problem, iDB has you covered. We’ve compiled a list of ways to follow the action on your iOS devices…

* This is by far the best solution for watching the Super Bowl on a mobile device for free. Like its website counterpart, the app will feature a high-quality live stream of the game, which will be available to all viewers in the US starting Sunday morning at 12AM EST and ending at 3AM on Monday. Outside of that window, coverage will only be available to subscribers of select cable services.
* But no matter when you watch it, it’ll have to be on an iPad. League restrictions prevent live streaming of the game on iPhone. This app is available for free.

* If you simply must watch the Super Bowl on your iPhone, you’ll be happy to know that you can do so using the NFL’s official Mobile app, but there are a few caveats. The first is you’ll have to be a Verizon customer, as the carrier has an exclusive deal with the NFL on mobile streaming rights. And the second is you’ll have to sign up for the $5 per month premium NFL service.
* If you are a Big Red customer, though, and have a couple of bucks to spare, then this is another great way to catch the game. (It’s worth noting that if you try to visit the Fox website from your iPhone, it will just automatically redirect you to a landing page for the app). This app is available for free.

* ESPN SportsCenter has long been my go-to score-keeper. And if you’re not going to be in front of a TV tomorrow, or eligible to stream the game to a mobile device, you’ll want it on your iPhone’s Home screen. There are similar apps available, but this one looks sharp and provides quick and easy access to play-by-play, stats, injury reports and anything else you could want outside of live video. This app is available for free.

* Even though I plan to be at home, glued to my TV set all day tomorrow, I will still have Twitter open on my iPhone or iPad. It’s the perfect companion for a big event like this, allowing you to chat with others about the game, and read commentary from experts and insiders. You just have to know who to  follow: @SuperBowl, @NFL, @TerryBlountESPN, @andy850KOA, @Broncos @Seahawks, and then of course the #SuperBowl hashtag. As for which client to use, I prefer Tweetbot, but you’d do fine with the official Twitter one. This app is available for free.
* And that’s it for our list. If you can think of something we missed, definitely let us know about it in the comments below!
