* If you’re looking for a way to make your Notification Center cleaner, make sure to check out NCFold. The tweak places your notifications into similar groups to make it more simple and efficient to view them. Tapping on a section allows you to switch between the folded or expanded view.
* By default, when you swipe down the Home screen to open bring up Notification Center, it will display the last opened tab. With NCObey, you can set the default tab that you want to be displayed first when you open Notification Center and you can also set the ‘Today’ tab as the default tab when there are no pending notifications.
* Additionally, NCObey adds three gestures that allow you to go directly to a specific tab: swipe down on the far left of the screen to open the ‘Today’ view, swipe down from the middle area to open the ‘All’ tab and swipe down from the far right of the screen to open the ‘Missed’ tab.
* NCObey can be installed for free via Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* When you have a lot of notifications piled up, it takes some time to remove all of them from Notification Center. NCSingleTapClear speeds up the process by allowing you to tap the ‘X’ button only once to remove the notifications instead of tapping twice. This tweak can be downloaded for free from the BigBoss repo.
* These are the best jailbreak tweaks that allow you to customize iOS 7′s Notification Center and enjoy more features. If we have missed a tweak that deserves to make it to the list, let us know in the comments section below.
