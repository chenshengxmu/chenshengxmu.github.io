* Yesterday, Tim Cook sat with The Telegraph’s Allister Heath to talk a range of topics, including the Apple TV and the future of television, the forthcoming arrival of the iPad Pro and plans for the Apple Watch.
* According to Cook, the company is considering additional health features. He also revealed why Apple doesn’t want to put the Apple Watch through the certification process by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more.
* “We don’t want to put the watch through the FDA process, but I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it,” he said, hinting that Apple may have more plans for the health sphere.
* If you’ll recall, Apple held several meetings with FDA executives ahead of the Apple Watch’s launch in April 2015. But why on Earth wouldn’t the company want the Apple Watch itself to become a regulated, government-licensed health product?

* “I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it—maybe an app, maybe something else,” said Cook.
* Ahead of its unveiling, the device was widely rumored to incorporate a bunch of health sensors only to hit the market with just a built-in heart rate monitor.
* Nothing can damped Cook’s enthusiasm about the iPad’s prospect, despite several quarters of declining sales due to longer upgrade cycles compared to smartphones and the general slowdown in the sector.
* Calling the iPad Pro a viable replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many people, Cook insists that average consumer is no longer interested in PCs.

* People planning on buying an iPad Pro “will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones,” Cook argued.
* “If you sketch then it’s unbelievable,” he said, adding that “you don’t want to use a pad anymore.” Apple yesterday began airing its very first commercial for the iPad Pro as the device is scheduled to go on sale tomorrow.
* As for the Apple TV, Cook said early sales are exceptional but didn’t talk numbers. “We got out of the shoot extremely strong; very strong in the first few days,” he said.
* Cook thinks apps “will really change the living room entirely” and anticipates the device becoming “much larger than we would have predicted.”
