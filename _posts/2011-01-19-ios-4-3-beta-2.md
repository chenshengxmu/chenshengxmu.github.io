* Apple just released iOS 4.3 beta 2 to developers. If you’re a developer, hop over to the iOS Dev Center and download a copy of this pre-version of iOS 4.3 for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Apple TV.
* I guess we’ll find out relatively quickly if iOS 4.3 beta 2 brings anything new to the table from the first beta release.
