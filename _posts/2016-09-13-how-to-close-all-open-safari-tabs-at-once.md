* There are going to be times when you’re browsing the web on your iPhone or iPad and you will have more than one browsing tab open in Safari, but you’re not going to want to keep all those tabs opened forever.
* Up until now, you had to close each tab individually, which proved to be rather time consuming. Rather than tapping on the close button for each and every individual one, iOS 10 has two new actions you can use to close out of all opened tabs at once, and we’ll show you each in this tutorial.
* If you’re in the middle of viewing a web page, all you need to do is tap and hold on the tab switching button until you see a prompt:

* When the prompt appears, tap on the option that lets you close however many tabs you have open. In this case, it’s three, so we tap on the red Close 3 Tabs button.
* Another way to do this is to tap and hold on the Done button at the bottom right of Safari until a prompt appears:

* When the prompt appears, tap on the red-colored option that lets you close all of your open tabs.
* No matter which method we use, our opened Safari tabs will be closed instantaneously so we don’t have to painstakingly go through them, one by one.
* In my opinion, method two is more convenient when you’re in the middle of a multi-tab workflow, and method one is more convenient when you’re done browsing the web altogether.
