* The iControlPad was one of the first iPhone-compatible game controllers to hit the market. It was a bit bulky, and didn’t garner much developer support. But nevertheless, it was a pioneer.
* Well it looks like the folks behind the accessory, Product 3 LLC, haven’t been resting on their laurels. They just announced the new iControlPad 2, and it comes with a host of new features…
* The group says that the inspiration for iControlPad 2 mostly came from user feedback. They’ve made several adjustments, including adding a 55-key keyboard and additional rapid fire keys.
* Also, the controller’s housing is now made of  both metal and plastic, for more durability, and the phone cradle has also been upgraded. And, it can game for 12-14 hours straight on a single charge.
* But perhaps the most interesting thing about the gamepad is that it’s completely open source. It will connect to almost anything — iOS and Android devices, Macs, PCs, Linux systems. If you’re building a mechanical robot and need a controller, this will work. It’s completely hackable.
* Product 3 says that it has working prototypes, and it’s enlisted the help of Kickstarter to raise $150,000 to start production. If you want one, a pledge of $69 gets you on the pre-order list.
* The iControlPad2 may not look as refined or polished as some of the other iPhone-friendly gamepads out there. But if it’s aimed at hackers and hardware-modders, it doesn’t have to.
* What do you think?
