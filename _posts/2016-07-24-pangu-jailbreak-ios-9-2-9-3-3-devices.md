* The Pangu Team released a jailbreak Sunday morning that is capable of jailbreaking iOS 9.2 to iOS 9.3.3 devices. Only compatible with 64-bit devices so far, the jailbreak is of the semi-untether kind, meaning a piece of software must be run on the device every time it is rebooted to be put back in a jailbroken state.
* The tool is currently available in Chinese only, but should be available in English soon.
* On its website, Pangu notes that this jailbreak will allow users to jailbreak their devices “on demand,” a somewhat unusual term when it comes to jailbreaking. Pangu explains that the jailbreak can easily be removed simply by rebooting the device. To re-jailbreak the device, the user will have to run the PP app that was installed on the device during the jailbreak process.
* Once rebooted, there is no visible track of a jailbreak on your device. After running the PP app, your device will come back in its jailbreak glory, with all tweaks and packages back on the device. Again, this is an unusual situation, but it’s better than nothing.
* Because it is currently compatible with 64-bit devices only, this jailbreak will only work with the following devices:
* This jailbreak will only work with the following versions of iOS: 9.2, 9.2.1, 9.3, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.3.3.
* It is currently compatible with Windows computers only. A mac version will likely be released in the near future.
* Although Pangu mentioned an English version of the jailbreak will be available really soon, it is currently available in Chinese.
* As always, one of the main questions when a new jailbreak drops is: is it worth it? This all depends on you and your usage of iOS. In this sense, we can’t tell you whether you should or should not jailbreak.
* What we can tell you though, is that Pangu has a history of releasing jailbreaks that aren’t necessarily thoroughly tested, sometimes causing issues for early users. If you want to avoid problems, your best chance is to sit this one out for a few days until Pangu can update the tool to fix possible bugs that will surface.
* Also worth noting is that some users are reporting that malware seems to be detected on their machines after installing the tool. This is something to keep in mind.
* We have published a tutorial showing how to use Pangu to jailbreak iOS 9.3.3. Note that this tutorial is currently for Windows only (or Mac machine with Bootcamp or Virtual Machine). The tutorial is also currently based on the Chinese version of the tool. We will update the post with English screenshots when available.
* What’s your situation? Are you going to use the tool right now, or you going to wait for the English version, or possibly an updated version of the jailbreak tool? If you’ve been using this jailbreak, what’s been your experience so far? Tell us all about it in the comments section below.
