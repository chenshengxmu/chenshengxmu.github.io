* Apple is celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Beatles’ performance on The Ed Sullivan Show with a new Apple TV channel. Simply named ‘The Beatles,’ the new channel allows you to watch the legendary British rock band’s performance on The Ed Sullivan Show from 1964. There are also links to the band’s digital releases on iTunes, which are available for purchase on iTunes digitally for the first time…
* The band’s 14-minute performance from New York City is now available for streaming in its entirety, for a limited time.
* The channel description reads:
* The Beatles’ three consecutive appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964 brought Beatlemania into the living rooms across America. Celebrate the 50th anniversary of their arrival in the Sates with the Beatles’ U.S. albums – available digitally for the first time. Plus, for a limited time, watch the group’s historic debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show.
* The milestone performance was seen by 60 percent of America’s television audience.
* In addition to Apple’s $99 media-streamin box, the band’s performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, along with newly added iTunes music downloads, is available on Mac or PC via the iTunes Store.

* The channel should automatically appear on your Apple TV’s Home screen. If not, apply the update manually in Settings > General > Software Updates > Update Software.
* Back in September, The Beatles music became available for streaming via iTunes Radio. Other Internet radio stations such as Pandora and Slacker Radio have long offered Beatles stations, by the way.
* Following a long-standing dispute between Apple and The Beatles’ Apple Corps, the two parties back in 2010 struck a landmark agreement to bring The Beatles music downloads to iTunes.
