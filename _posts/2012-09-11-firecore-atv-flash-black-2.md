* Back in August, we reported that FireCore was working on a major update for its aTV Flash (black) application. The software enables jailbroken Apple TVs to perform a wide range of additional tasks.
* Well, today, FireCore released that update in the form of aTV Flash (black) 2.0. It features a new library view, which makes browsing through your content easier than ever before, and much more…
* From the aTV Flash (black) 2.0 change log:
* The new Library View looks great, as does the integrated media search. Together, they make it a lot easier to browse through content by variables, including genre, or to find something specific.
* Also not to be overlooked is the addition of trakt.tv syncing. Essentially, this makes it so that when you start a movie or TV show on one Apple TV, its status is automatically synced with other units.
* The good news is, the 2.0 update is free for current aTV Flash (black) owners. Just pop into the app’s Maintenance menu. And if you don’t have it already, you can grab it for just $29.95.
* Remember, this is only compatible with second-generation Apple TVs, as the new one has not been jailbroken yet.
