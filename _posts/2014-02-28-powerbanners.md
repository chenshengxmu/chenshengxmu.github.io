* Don’t you just hate it when you’re in the middle of a game or a movie only to be interrupted by the low power notification at 20% and at 10%? Wouldn’t it better if the notification was a bit less intrusive? That’s the premise behind PowerBanners, a new jailbreak tweak available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* For those of you who have been around for a while, there’s another jailbreak tweak called LowPowerBanner that brings similar functionality to iOS. Sadly, as is the case with many tweaks for iOS 6 and below, it was never updated for iOS 7. PowerBanners was created from the ground up with iOS 7 in mind, and it works on arm64 devices like the iPhone 5s as well.
* We’ve taken some time to test out PowerBanners and we can report that it works as advertised. Want to know just how well it works? Check inside to watch our hands-on walkthrough.
* After installing PowerBanners, you’ll need to venture over to the stock Settings app and locate the preferences for the tweak. Inside PowerBanners’ preferences, you’ll find three toggles: a dedicated kill-switch, a toggle to vibrate upon banner notification, and a toggle to provide a low power banner notification after respring.

* Once your device dips below 21% battery life, you’ll be greeted with a non-intrusive banner notification alerting you on your battery status. Because the notification is in the form of a banner, and not an alert, your game or movie will continue to play as normal with no interruption.
* If you ask me, low power alerts should have never been these ridiculously intrusive alerts to begin with, but it is what it is. If you’re looking for a way to stop the annoying low power alerts and you’re running iOS 7, then this is the jailbreak tweak that you need.
