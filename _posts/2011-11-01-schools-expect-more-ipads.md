* Apple’s iPad is beginning to take over from computers as the key electronic learning device in schools, according to a new survey by Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster.
* The survey of 25 schools and their technology directors found that all of them were making use of Apple’s iPad while, just as interestingly, none of them were using an Android-powered tablet.
* In fact, iPads are becoming so popular that many technology directors believe that there will soon be more iPads per student than computers…
* With the wide belief that the enterprise mirrors education, the news that iPads are beginning to win over the classroom is also good news for Apple in the business sector.
* Apple has been pushing the iPad as a learning tool of late, and have even been airing ads that drive the point home. It certainly makes sense. Which would you most likely pay attention to: a boring text book, or a shiny new iPad?
* It is also clear that Android tablets have some ground to make up. The release of the next version of Android, Ice Cream Sandwich, could help to give Google’s mobile OS a leg up, but they will need to start making headway sooner rather than later.
* The Piper Jaffray survey also notes that iPads are seemingly being used to supplement full-blown computers, rather than replace them.
* So long as those computers are Macs, we don’t think Apple will really care!
