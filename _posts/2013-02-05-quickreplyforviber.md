* Are you a fan of the BiteSMS jailbreak tweak, but prefer using services other than iMessage or SMS to send texts to your friends? Back in June, Delicious Inc. released Quick Reply for WhatsApp; which essentially brought BiteSMS’s quick reply pane to WhatsApp’s notifications. Today, on the heels of the release of the evasi0n jailbreak, the developers behind BiteSMS bring a similar tweak to Viber in iOS 5 and iOS 6.
* Viber is another cross platform messaging app that allows users to make free calls, as well as send texts and photos. The original app works between iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Nokia, and Bada. It’s a free alternative platform that is compatible with every major smartphone on the market. Viber is growing in popularity, so it’s ripe for a jailbreak tweak of its own…
* Jeff reviews BiteSMS, the tweak Quick Reply for Viber is based on.
* While Quick Reply for Viber will seem familiar if you use BiteSMS, like Quick Reply for WhatsApp, it doesn’t currently include all of BiteSMS’ features. Currently it only features the core Quick Reply pop-up pane, accessible from any Viber notification.
* According to Delicious Inc.’s FAQ page, landscape mode, quick compose, multimedia, and configurable buttons are planned for future implementation. These features are also planned for Quick Reply for WhatsApp, but half a year later these features still haven’t been included, so don’t hold your breath.
* Quick Reply for Viber includes a free 7-day trial, though the tweak requires a yearly subscription of $1.99 to use. Since Apple releases new versions of iOS which break compatibility, this yearly fee enables Delicious Inc to pay for ongoing development costs.
