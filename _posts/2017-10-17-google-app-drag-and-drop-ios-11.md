* Google’s dedicated search app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch was updated this morning with several improvements, including support for iOS 11’s drag and drop on iPad, the ability to open places and get directions with Apple Maps or Waze, and more.
* With support for iOS 11’s drag and drop, iPad owners can drag various pieces of content from the Google app and drop it into whatever app is open next to it, or vice versa. You can use this feature to add content from Google to your emails, presentations and notes, drag text from other apps to search it in the Google app and more.
