* Like any new product Apple releases, the new iPad has been seeing a tremendous amount of pre-orders. We already noted that the new iPad has already sold out across all stores, and the third-generation Apple TV’s shipping time has been pushed back 2 weeks.
* Today, Apple told USA Today that demand for the new iPad has been “off the charts”:
* “Customer response to the new iPad has been off the charts and the quantity available for pre-order has been purchased. Customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date.”
* While shipping time has been pushed back in Apple’s online store, there will be a limited number of iPads available in Apple’s retail stores Friday, March 16th. These products will be available on a first come, first served basis — so you’re going to want to get there quick.
* So why is demand for the new iPad so high? The specs for Apple’s latest tablet are amazing: a Retina display, larger battery, 5-megapixel camera with upgraded sensors, 1GB of RAM, and dual-core A5X processor with quad-core graphics.
* Were you quick to get your pre-order in?
