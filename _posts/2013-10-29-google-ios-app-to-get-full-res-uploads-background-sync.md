* The Internet giant’s ‘A Morning with Google+’ event is underway and the company’s just made it official: the Google+ app for the iPhone and iPad will soon be updated with the ability to upload full resolution images to Google+ Photos, previously Picasa Web Albums and now part of Google’s social thing.
* Another new feature being mentioned is support for Background Refresh in iOS 7 which will allow the application to automatically synchronize your photos in the background, even when it’s not running.
* Currently, background photo sync only works if you have the app open…
* I’ve always wondered why the heck Google+ wouldn’t let me upload my shots in the glorious full resolution.
* Considering I wanted to switch to Google+ Photos as my main image archive on the web and, it stands to reason I postponed my plans until Goole fixed this omission.
* These enhancements should now bring the iOS app on par with its Android counterpart, which has always offered full-size backups and background sync.

* The company has not said when an update to Google+ for iOS may hit the App Store, though I suspect it’ll arrive in the coming days rather than later today. Either way, you can count on iDB to keep you in the loop.
* You can stream Google’s event here.

* Google+ is a free download from the App Store.
* The universal binary weighs 30.6MB and requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6 or later.
