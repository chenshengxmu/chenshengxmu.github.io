* About ten days since Tweetbot for OS X brought these new features to the Mac, now Tweetbot for iPhone and iPod touch has picked up support for notifications related to Twitter’s new embedded quoting feature while laying groundwork for longer Direct Messages, a feature Twitter announced almost a month weeks ago but has yet to enable on its end.
* Also, Tweetbot 3.6.2 for Mac now produces crisper video thanks to improved video upload quality.
* You don’t need to manually enable longer Direct Messages in Tweetbot, but keep in mind you won’t be able to message others using Direct Messages longer than 140 characters until Twitter enables this feature on its servers.
* As mentioned before, you can now elect to receive push notifications when someone has retweeted your tweet using Twitter’s new quotation format.

* As shown on the screenshot above, enabling notifications for Quoted Tweet requires you to flip the Quotes switch to ON under the Notifications section of your account in Tweetbot’s settings.
* Tweetbot 3.6.2 for iOS highlights:
* This update is free to existing users of Tweetbit. The 7.3-megabyte iPhone and iPod touch app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Tweetbot 3 for iPhone and iPod touch for $4.99 in the App Store.
