* Good news for Spotify users this morning: the streaming music service has delivered a much needed redesign to its web, iPhone and desktop clients. The new look brings the apps more in line with competitors like Rdio, and establishes a single identity across all platforms.
* The redesign comes to the iPhone (it doesn’t look like it’s on the iPad yet) by way of the version 1.0 update. It’s much darker than before, and features trendy effects like blur and rounded iconography. Spotify has also made a handful of performance and stability improvements….

* Here’s an excerpt from the announcement on Spotify’s blog:
* Today we’re launching the best-looking Spotify ever. Introducing a new darker theme, refreshed typography and rounded iconography, playing your favourite music has never looked so good.
*  – Content is king. Our new design makes accessing your favourite music smoother than ever before. The new dark theme and refined interface lets the content come forward and ‘pop’, just like in a cinema when you dim the lights. – It’s Your Music collection. Save albums and browse their beautiful cover art, gather your favourite artists and create playlists for every mood and moment. Found a song or album that you like? Just hit save to add it to your collection. It’s that simple. – We know you’ll love it. We’ve listened to all your great feedback to ensure that everything looks and feels just right. You told us you preferred a darker interface – so here it is. 
* And here’s a promotional clip showing the new design in action:

* I’m not a Spotify subscriber, but I do use its free services from time to time and I have to say that the new iPhone app is very impressive. It loads quickly, navigation is intuitive and nimble, and the updated design looks great. It truly feels like everything was rebuilt from the ground up.
* If you’re a current Spotify user, grabbing this update is a no-brainer, but even if you aren’t I recommend checking it out. You can find the new app in the App Store for free. The base services are free, but a Premium subscription costs $9.99 per month (and there’s a 1 month free trial).
