* Sega, a console maker turned games developer, is pretty active on the iOS platform. It’s been churning out various episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and recently launched its popular Crazy Taxi game on the iPhone. Today, Sega released a brand new iOS game set in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe. Called Sonic Jump, it’s Sega’s first iOS-only game.
* As the name suggests, Sonic Jump has your charming hedgehog character jumping up the platforms, collecting coins, avoiding enemies, squaring off against Dr. Eggman and a whole bunch more. It should be instantly familiar to anyone who has played platform jumpers like Doodle Jump. Fans of Sega games will no doubt feel right at home.
* Sonic Jump runs natively on both the iPhone and iPad and is provided as a universal binary setting you back two bucks. A few screenies, more info and a trailer can be found past the fold…
* You can play as either the Sonic or Tails & Knuckles character and play across some traditional and new worlds in either story or arcade mode. The game also features unlockable items, friend challenges and more.
* The following gallery contains a few screenshots from the iPhone version.
