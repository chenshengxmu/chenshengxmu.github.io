* As Apple is prepping to kick off mass-production of 2018’s iPhone models, its favorite manufacturer Foxconn is now offering staff retention bonuses and ramping up seasonal hiring.
* Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes today quoted a new report published by the Economic Daily News newspaper claiming that Foxconn began ramping up hiring for its plants in China’s Zhengzhou province where its workers assemble iPhones.
* The supplier is offering a one-time bonus of up to CNY 2,000, (about $295) to any employees who’d be willing to renew their contract and help assemble next-generation iPhones.
* The hiring spree should last through November 2018.
* Foxconn, the sole manufacturer of Apple’s flagship iPhone X smartphone, recorded weaker than expected profits in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to high costs associated with factory retooling and equipment purchases ahead of last year’s mass-production of iPhone X.
* To prevent the same from happening for this year’s iPhone refresh, the Apple supplier has applied “stricter cost management,” the paper added.
* Here’s a breakdown of Foxconn’s iPhone output by model:
* Any remaining orders will be fulfilled by Pegatron.
* There’s no word as of yet whether Apple’s other major contract manufacturer, Taiwan-based Pegatron, is about to kick off a hiring spree of its own in preparation for the upcoming devices.
