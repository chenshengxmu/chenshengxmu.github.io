* San Diego, California-headquartered MacPhun, the makers of some of  the finest photography and image editing applications for the Mac, iPhone and iPad, today announced what’s being billed as “the most advanced HDR software in the world,“ a brand new Mac app called Aurora HDR.
* Available for pre-order today and arriving November 19, the Mac-only app contains every tool you’ll ever need to produce high-quality HDR images and includes handy one-click presets, support for layers, custom textures, native RAW file format and more.
* The app combines Macphun’s proprietary image processing and software development experience with Tray’s photography expertise and passion.
* HDR, or High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography, is a photographic technique which overcomes the limitations of image sensors by utilizing multiple exposures of the same subject, each shot at different exposure values.

* The software then merges the individual shots into a single shot that has a much greater exposure range. Your iPhone takes HDR photos and with Aurora and its HDR algorithms now the entire spectrum of HDR looks is at your fingertips.
* You have one-click presets like Signature Pro presets by Trey Ratcliff, but if you want to move a bunch of sliders to achieve that perfect look, you can do that too. Selective editing capability includes such features as layers, masking and brushes.

* With detail enhancement, you can boost drama in your photos. As a bonus, controls such as Unique Radiance, custom texture blending, extensive color and toning and more should help bring the best out of your HDR-enhanced photos.
* Last but not least, with plug-ins available for Apple’s Aperture and Adobe’s Lightroom apps in the Pro edition of Aurora HDR, professional photographers can now apply rich edits to their HDR photographs without leaving Aperture or Lightroom.

* The full list of features is as follows:
* The app supports popular image formats like PNG, JPG, 8-bit and 16-bit TIFF, GIF, layered Photoshop PSD files, including RAW formats (.CR2, .NEF, .ORF, .RAF, .ERF, .ARW, .RW2, .PEF and others) and Color Profile settings.

* Aurora HDR also has built-in support for graphics tablets from Wacom and other tablets with pen, Apple’s Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 and other devices.
* For more information about the app, check out the Aurora HDR website.
* Trey Ratcliff isn’t just a celebrity endorser: MacPhun has been working with him for the past 12 months to co-develop the software and took advantage of his valuable input based on his vast experience with the current tools in the market.
* Trey has more than fourteen million fans on the Internet and his images have been viewed over an astounding 115 billion times.
* “When Macphun looked to create the best HDR software ever, we turned to Trey to assist at all stages,” explain developers. “Together we agreed on a class-leading feature set, interface design, workflow and more.”
* This partnership will continue with future Aurora HDR updates, said MacPhun.
