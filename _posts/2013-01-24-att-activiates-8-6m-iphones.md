* Following up reports from Apple and Verizon, AT&T has just released its earnings results for the 2012 holiday quarter. And they actually look pretty good. The carrier sold a record amount of smartphones during the three quarter period, and activated a record amount of iPhones. Full breakdown of the results after the break…
* From AT&T’s press release:
* The fact that smartphones represented 89% of all of AT&T’s postpaid phone sales is a big deal. That means that only 11% of its postpaid customers bought feature, or non-smart, phones. The 10.2 million smartphone sales figure is also huge, as it shatters the company’s previous record of 9 million, set back during last year’s Q4.
* Of course, the number we’re most interested is iPhone sales. AT&T activated 8.6 million of them, which accounted for a staggering 84% of its total smartphone mix. That means that out of the 10.2 million smartphones it sold, only 1.6 million of them were from “other” platforms including Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry.
* But there were some asterisks to the carrier’s fourth quarter. For example, despite its $17.6 billion in wireless revenues, it still managed to lose $3.9 billion. The carrier noted that the loss was due to a restructuring of its pension plans, and the higher number of subsidies it had to pay out for all of the smartphones it sold in the quarter.
* Over all of 2012, though, AT&T reported $127.4 billion in revenue and $7.3 billion in profit. Not bad. The carrier says it plans to reinvest that money in new spectrum and other facets to boost its network. Earlier this week, it announced a new deal to acquire the remnants of Alltel, which includes spectrum, license and other assets.
