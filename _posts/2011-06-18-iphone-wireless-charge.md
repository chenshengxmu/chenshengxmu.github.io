title: Future iMacs and MacBooks to Charge Your iPhone Wirelessly?

* In last week’s iOS 5 announcement, there seemed to be an emphasis on “cutting the cord.” With new iCloud and Wi-Fi sync services, users will no longer have to depend on tethering their iDevices to their computers for syncs and backups.
* From the looks of this Apple patent that surfaced earlier this month, it seems that Apple has been researching methods to do away with the infamous white USB cord completely. The filing is titled, “Wireless power utilization in a local computing environment…”
* In other words, wireless charging. The documents explain that the technology utilizes near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power transmission. As long as compatible devices are close enough to the power source, they can receive a wireless charge.
* As SlashGear suggests, Apple could be working on an integrated wireless charging system for all of its products. Imagine the wireless power supply embedded in a MacBook Pro or iMac. It could wirelessly charge a number of products, from iPhones and iPads to keyboards and mice.
* I don’t know if I need another device transmitting wireless signals around my body, but I like the idea of not having to continuously replace my mouse batteries. I’d love to see this patent make its way into future Apple products.
* Would you?
