* Non-developers wanting to try out the new OS X 10.10 Yosemite before it launches this fall will be happy to know that Apple is opening up the beta to the public via its AppleSeed Seeding program. That’s the good news, that bad news is that only the first 1 million applicants will get access.
* If you haven’t already, hurry over to Apple’s AppleSeed registration page and enter your iTunes credentials to sign up. As you can imagine, Apple’s servers are getting slammed right now, so the pages are loading very slowly. But if you wait for them to speed up, you might just miss out!
* From the AppleSeed page:
* Join the OS X Beta Program and help make the next release of OS X our best yet. Install the latest
* pre-release software, try it out, and submit your feedback. The program is limited to the first one million people who sign up, so join today. 
* Once you’ve successfully joined the program, you should get a redemption code to install the OS X Yosemite Beta from the Mac App Store when it becomes available. Then you’re free to begin using it, and Apple just asks that you make sure to document bugs with the Feedback Assistant app.
* A few things worth noting here. The first is that some of the features announced today won’t be available initially, and some are going to be US-first for a while. Also, as with any beta, make sure not to install Yosemite on your main device, as it is likely to cause app conflicts and other issues.
