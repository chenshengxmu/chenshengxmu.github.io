* It is no secret that Apple enjoys quite a nice profit margin on its own accessories, cables and adapters for iOS devices. The new 80 percent smaller Lightning interface found on the iPhone 5, fifth-gen iPod touch and seventh-gen iPod nano is no exception.
* If you have a bunch of legacy accessories sitting around, chances are you will need Apple’s Lightning to 30-pin adapter, available in $29 direct-plug and $39 cable flavors. But if you’re shopping on a tight budget or Apple’s decision not to include a free adapter with the iPhone 5 has been ticking you off, do check out some nice unofficial, much cheaper alternatives that have cropped up on Amazon…
* Third-party Lightning adapters typically fetch between ten and eighteen bucks, at least half Apple’s asking price.
* Vendors Nanotch and iTronz already have their unofficial adapters for sale on Amazon, the former fetching just ten bucks (for a cool $20 saving versus Apple) and the latter priced at $17.95. Both are shipping by the end of September (Apple’s arrives in October) and are available on eBay as well.
* The Nanotch accessory lists the following features:
* • 100 % short and resistance tested • specifically designed for iPhone 5 and iPod touch • 30 pin to 8 pin adapter
* And this is how it looks.

* The other one from iTronz is spec’d as follows:
* • Lightning cable adapter for newest generation of Apple products • adapter to use your new Apple products with older accessories • use your iPhone 5 with older models of accessories • 20cm cord • small adapter for easy connection
* Here it is.

* We’re not sure what to make of this.
* Until we get our hands on the adapters and test them with Lightning-equipped iOS devices, there’s no way of telling whether these are safe to use.
* iLounge reported earlier this month that Cupertino would be the sole manufacturer of the Lightning to 30-pin adapters, reportedly selling them starting at just ten bucks a pop.
* Either that report wasn’t true or Nanotch and iTronz adapters are cheap knockoffs, in which case Apple could easily take them down at a moment’s notice.
* Oh, and Jawbone proclaimed the old dock dead.

* By the way, if you’re building an adapter of your own, Apple has conveniently posted the full iPhone 5 schematics.
* I wonder how long before a knockoff Lightning to HDMI and VGA cables arrive…
