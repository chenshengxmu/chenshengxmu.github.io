* The new Apple TV expected to be unveiled at next month’s event will feature a remote control with motion sensors, reports TechCrunch. Citing reliable sources, the site says the remote “likely includes several axis’ worth of sensors that put its control on par with a Nintendo Wii remote.”
* Apple has for years been rumored to be tinkering with motion control. The iPhone-maker has acquired multiple companies with expertise and proprietary technology related to the field, and it has filed several patent applications over the last 5 years regarding motion-sensing inventions.
* Motion gestures is believed to be just one of the new Apple TV remote’s input options. In May, the New York Times reported that the remote will also feature a touchpad for scrolling, at least two physical buttons, and a microphone for voice commands. It’s also said to be slightly thicker.
* This all makes for an extremely interesting device when you add in the all-but-confirmed SDK Apple is expected to launch alongside the new Apple TV. It’s not hard to imagine developers coming up with innovative apps and games that respond to physical, touch, motion and voice controls.
* Speaking with folks familiar with the project, TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino says the experience of using the new set-top box will “blow away the types of junky smart TV interfaces we’ve had to deal with so far.” In fact it’s so good, he believes it’ll be dubbed “the first real Apple TV product.”
* Apple is obviously gearing up for something major, sending out media invitations on Thursday for a September 9 event at the gigantic Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The company is expected to use the event to unveil new iPhones, an Apple TV and possibly new iPads.
