* Earlier this week, Beats launched its highly anticipated streaming music service dubbed Beats Music. The service is entering into a crowded marketplace, several years late, but it hopes to differentiate itself from the Rdios and Spotifys with custom in-house curation methods.
* But the launch isn’t going as smoothly as the company would’ve liked. It’s had a hard time dealing with the influx of users, and has had to shut down signups in order to work out the kinks. The good news, though, is that it’s doubling the length of its free trial to make up for it…
* From the Beats Music blog (via Engadget):
* “Huge thanks to everyone for making our launch day yesterday so successful. We’ve been blown away by the love that made us the #1 Music App in the iTunes Store.
* Due to the extremely high volume of interest in our service some users are experiencing issues. Most people are unaffected but our priority is to give everyone a great experience. We prepared for issues like these, have a plan, and are going to hold off on letting more people in while we put this plan in action.”
* The company notes that those who were able to get in yesterday before the shutdown occurred will be able to continue using Beats Music. And it says that new users can still download the app and register, and they will get notified as soon as they are able to start using the service.
* To make up for the inconvenience, Beats says that everyone who registers this week will get an additional seven days added to their free trial. So adding that to the standard 7-day free trial, you would be able to listen to Beats Music for two weeks before having to pay anything.
* After that, the service is $9.99 a month for unlimited streaming of over 20 million songs, unlimited album downloads for offline streaming and no ads. If you’re interested, you can download the app from the App Store for free, or sign up on the web at www.beatsmusic.com.
