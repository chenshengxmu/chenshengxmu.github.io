* Trademark lawyer Brian Conroy today discovered some additional trademark filings by Apple, including one for something called “A10 Fusion” and the other for “iSight Duo”. Both of these trademarks were filed for on June 8, 2016 in Brunei. Additionally, Apple also filed for “Depth” and “Writeboard” trademarks.
* The iPhone 7 Plus is said to have a dual-lens camera that should allow for true optical zoom and possibly the ability to refocus images after they have been taken.
* The new trademarks were originally discovered by MacRumors reader Ryan Simmons. “iSight Duo” is most likely the marketing name for the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens camera system. The “Depth” trademark could also have something to do with the iPhone’s camera, but we’re just speculating here.
* The “Scribble” could presumably be for an Apple Pencil feature on the iPhone that Tim Cook hinted at in a May interview with an Indian TV station. Keep in mind that in some jurisdictions it’s too easy to file a fake trademark application.
* “I’ve no idea how easy or otherwise it is to make a fake trademark application in Brunei, but the fact the applications are in Apple’s name and that are purportedly filed by local legal representatives certainly lends some legitimacy to them being real and genuine,” said Conroy.
* Apple has also filed for the following trademarks:
* I think there’s no longer any doubt that the new iPhones will be called “iPhone 7” and “iPhone 7 Plus” and have a dual-lens camera system dubbed “iSight Duo”, powered by a dedicated engine inside Apple’s in-house designed A10 chip.
