* Finally, a reason to jailbreak for many users. Filippo Bigarella’s Springtomize 3 (version 1.3) has gone live in the Cydia store as a free update ($2.99 new) for users who purchased the iOS 7 version.
* Springtomize 3 brings tons of customization options to the iOS SpringBoard. Its name is literally the combination of the two words: SpringBoard + Customize = Springtomize. Head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo to download it now.
* This version of Springtomize brings iOS 8 support to the table, along with support for the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. I’ve been playing with Springtomize all morning, and it is a solid update, though, those expecting new features will have to wait on those to arrive. Check out our video walkthrough above, as I step through some of the things that Springtomize offers on my 5.5″ iPhone 6 Plus.
