* The popular mobile messaging service WhatsApp today received a pretty cool update in the App Store which adds the ability to share photos or videos from other apps installed on your iPhone via a new option exposed after tapping the Photo/Video Library button.
* In addition, WhatsApp has gained a pair of new shortcuts in the 3D Touch menu on the Home screen and now supports solid colors as chat backgrounds.
* Oh, and you can now zoom in on videos while they’re playing.
* In addition to the previous Search and New Chat Quick Actions, WhatsApp now supports a pair of additional items in its 3D Touch shortcut menu on the Home screen: Take Photo or Video, which does just that, and Starred Messages, which takes you to the list of individual messages you have starred to make them easier to search.
* WhatsApp also supports 3D Touch Peek and Pop 3D gestures within the app.
* Tap the leftmost button in the chat text entry field and select the Photo/Video Library option. Up pops the familiar interface for browsing photos and videos on your device, with one subtle change at the bottom in the form of a new Choose from another app button.

* Tap it and up pops iOS’s standard interface for selecting document provider extensions installed on your device. When you install an iOS app that supports document provider extensions, its file selection interface becomes available in any app that exposes Apple’s iCloud Drive to the user.
* If you have installed the Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive apps on your device, for example, you will be able to select these service in WhatsApp’s menu and choose a media file stored there.
* For instance, you could pick a photo in your Dropbox and Dropbox’s document provider extension will download the file in the background and send it to WhatsApp for you to send to a contact.
* How cool is that?
* In addition to a bunch of built-in wallpapers, WhatsApp at long last lets you select a solid color as your chat background. Tap on the Settings tab at the bottom, then go to the new Chats → Chat Wallpaper → Solid Colors section to select your chat background.
