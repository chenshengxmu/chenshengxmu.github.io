* Apple today officially confirmed its rumored media event will be indeed taking place on Wednesday, September 9. The press conference is widely expected to bring new iPhones, iPads and possibly a next-generation Apple TV.
* New pieces of information continue to surface in the run-up to the event. According to latest tidbits from a reputable publication with reliable sources, Apple won’t unveil an ‘iPhone 6c’ at the event.
* For starters, 9to5Mac today confirmed that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will indeed come in a brand new Apple Watch-inspired Rose Gold color option, as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted back in June.
* The new anodized aluminum colorway is described as a copper-like variation on the gold option originally introduced with the iPhone 5s back in 2013 and not a pinkish hue we saw on a batch of images now debunked as fake.

* As for a sapphire-coated screen that Apple wanted but failed to deploy on present-generation iPhones, the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will continue to use Apple’s “Ion-X” ionized glass.
* Regarding a rumored Force Touch screen providing user interface shortcuts, the new iPhones should incorporate pressure-sensitive screens that “may not be called Force Touch on the iPhone” despite sharing a similar underlying technology like Force Touch trackpads on Mac notebooks and the Apple Watch’s pressure-sensing screen.
* The so-called iPhone 6c is not on the agenda for the September 9 event. Sources who spoke with 9to5Mac are adamant that “the device is not yet ready to ship”.
* The same sources said Apple will discontinue the iPhone 5c when the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus release while retaining the iPhone 5s which will “drop the on-contract price to free.” The current-generation iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will keep selling after the new models begin shipping for a $100 less, as per 9to5Mac’s sources and conventional wisdom.

* Curiously enough, Apple reportedly prototyped a smaller iPhone model with a 3.5-inch display, but it won’t be moving forward “with actually releasing such a device.”
* According to the rumor-mill, the iPhone 6c is supposed to adopt a metal body with iPhone 6-style design, incorporate a four-inch Retina display and feature last year’s iPhone 6 hardware, including the A8 processor, Touch ID and NFC for mobile payment.
* The focus of September 9’s event increasingly appear to be the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones.
* This year’s S-upgrade is expected to bring a stronger body, a faster A9 processor, Force Touch, improved Touch ID and NFC, a twelve-megapixel back camera with 4K video capture, an improved front-facing shooter and animated wallpapers on the Lock screen inspired by the Apple Watch’s Motion face, among other improvements.
* We are committed to bringing you a comprehensive coverage of Apple’s event and will be reporting more about the new iPhones as new information and rumors surface ahead of the press conference.
