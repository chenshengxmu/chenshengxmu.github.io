* After getting off to a shaky start, more than half of consumers shopping for a smartphone plan to buy an iPhone 5, according to a new Wall Street survey. Likewise, Twitter chatter indicates a growing number of Internet users hope to find Apple’s new handset under the Christmas tree.
* Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster told investors Thursday that 53.3 percent of a group polled Wednesday said they plan to purchase the iPhone 5 over the next month. That number is just slightly below the 54.9 percent found in mid-October, following the new smartphone’s launch…
* As Fortune’s Philip Elmer-Dewitt noted today, the pre-holiday 53.3 percent iPhone 5 interest is up from the 47.7 pre-launch in September, even withstanding the withering debate over the Apple Maps brouhaha.
* In Android’s case, 35.3 percent of the 800 people Munster polled said they intend to buy a phone powered by Google’s mobile operating system.
* That is essentially the same amount polled in September.

* However, the introduction of the iPhone 5 appears to have cost Android some buyers. While interest in an Android before the iPhone 5 was released stood at 39 percent, that level dropped around four points after Apple introduced the device.
* What about the single-digit also-rans, like Windows Phone and RIM?
* Microsoft began pre-iPhone 5 with 8.7 percent of those polled indicating they’d buy a Windows Phone handset. However, by Wednesday, that number had slid to 6.5 percent.
* RIM’s BlackBerry saw some gains between September and yesterday, but the advance was microscopic. After starting with 4.7 percent interest, 4.9 percent expressed interest by December 12.

* Munster also took the pulse of Twitter users, watch for the “iPhone 5” keyword, along with things like “bought,” “shipped” and “purchased.” The resulting “demand index” shows a level of interest 30-40 percent higher than the same period in 2011.
* According to the analyst:
* Over the past two weeks, the demand index is up an average of 36 percent [year-over-year] and we note that this is the iPhone 5 demand ahead of Christmas, when some may be waiting to be gifted the device, compared to the 4S, which would be in January given the 2.5 month comparison.
* As a result of the survey and Twitter comments, Munster said he has “continued confidence” in his forecast for 45 million iPhones sold with a 21 percent growth over the previous year.
* I’m not sure if I’d give too much significance to the Twitter findings, other than the level of online chatter concerning the iPhone 5 is longer-lasting than the 4S.
* On the other hand, it’s intriguing that demand for the iPhone 5 increased through the rumor stage and into the post-announcement period, where interest usually slacks.
* By comparison, Android took a hit early on and never recovered.
* Does this mean the iPhone 5 is living up to its hype and people are willing to overlook the mapping glitch?
