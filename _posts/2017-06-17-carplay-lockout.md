* When using CarPlay, your iPhone naturally displays the screen you see above for several seconds before automatically falling asleep and kicking you out to the Lock screen.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called CarPlay Lockout by iOS developer theo78825 prevents your device from locking you out and rather returns you to the Home screen after a brief display of the CarPlay screen.
* You can typically bypass the CarPlay screen manually by pressing the Home button while it’s showing, but CarPlay Lockout eliminates this unnecessary physical step, automating the process for you.
* CarPlay Lockout doesn’t have any options to configure, so you should start to notice that the CarPlay screen now disappears faster than before and how you’re kicked to the Home screen instead of the Lock screen immediately after installation.
* This improvement will let you or your passenger(s) to continue using the device after connecting to a CarPlay unit without any interruptions and without having to press the Home button to exit the screen.
* It’s indeed a tedious nitpick of Apple’s stock iOS functionality, but depending on how often you use CarPlay while you’re in the car, it might be worth trying for the added benefits of both hands-free convenience and time savings. Despite how minor it sounds, sometimes it’s the small details that can change a near-perfect experience to a perfect one.
* If you’re interested in giving CarPlay Lockout a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices that support CarPlay.
* Do you think disabling the lockout that happens after starting to use CarPlay will be convenient for your in-the-car usage? Share in the comments section below.
