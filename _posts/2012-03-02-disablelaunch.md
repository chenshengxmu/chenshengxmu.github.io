* DisableLaunch is a free jailbreak tweak that adds a security element to your iPhone’s Home screen.
* With the assistance of Activator, you can outright prevent apps from launching from your SpringBoard.
* It’s not the most surefire security feature ever invented, but it can get the job done in a pinch…
* From my testing it works fairly well, especially if you just want to keep children from launching apps. For more advanced users, workarounds can be found, such as launching Safari via Notification Center, etc.
* Still, for a free tweak, DisableLaunch does a pretty good job of keeping your iPhone secure. If your device is jailbroken, you can snag it today on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* What do you think?
