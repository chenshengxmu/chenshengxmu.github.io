* Sentry, the designer behind Auxo, has been extremely busy this year. In addition to helping design one of the most popular jailbreak tweaks we’ve seen in a long time, he’s also posted a number of well-received iOS concept videos.
* And today, we’re adding another concept clip to the list. It’s entitled ‘iOS Lock Screen Toggles,’ and as you might have guessed, it showcases Sentry’s vision for a Lock screen tweak that offers users quick access to Settings toggles…
* In typical Sentry fashion, the video is short and to the point. And while I really like the overall concept—the toggles are easily accessible and don’t take up Lock screen space—I’m not sure I like the design or the size of the actual icons.
* Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Cody, there’s already several jailbreak tweaks available that let you access Settings toggles from the Lock screen.” And you’re right. Off the top of my head there’s SwipeCam, PowerLock and SBSettings.
* But there are a lot of tweaks out there that perform similar functions to others—but maybe present the function in a different way. This equates to variety and competition, and is one of my favorite things about the jailbreak community.
* At any rate, we’d love to hear your thoughts on this concept. Would you use a tweak like this?
