title: 5 Things I'd Really Love to See From The Next iPhone

* There’s been all sorts of mutters, speculations, and guesses surrounding the next iPhone. Some of the ideas sound great, while others sound pretty terrible.
* Needless to say I think we all have our own personal wish list of things that we would like to see on the next iPhone, so I thought I’d share with you a few of mine. Obviously, these are just wishes, not necessarily realities, but hey, it’s nice to dream, isn’t it?
* My first wish for the next iPhone is none other than…
* This is really a no-brainer next step. 1080p is the de facto standard for video capture now, and the next iPhone should at least meet the curve if it’s not ahead of the curve.

* This would also allow for us to steam 1080p content to the Apple TV, or the next-generation Apple TV if it isn’t feasible to enable 1080p on the current gen device.
* 1080p capturing would be most beneficial for use over AirPlay since it’s unlikely that your eyes could discern a difference between 720p and full HD on such a small screen.
* Another no brainer here; instead of Apple creating two devices, why not make one iPhone capable of being used on any network? In the end that could cut down on prices, and customer confusion.

* It would also be nice to be able to travel with your iPhone virtually anywhere and still be able to use the device.
* FaceTime is cool and all, but the entire SD experience is a bit on the meh side. Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I used FaceTime due to its pathetic picture quality and shoddy sound.

* Even over a fat Wi-Fi connection, FaceTime is a 2nd tier experience when compared to Skype on the Mac.
* Since the new Macs feature FaceTime HD capabilities, I think it’s a sure bet that the mobile devices will follow suit going forward.
* Let’s face it, aluminum is virtually an Apple trademark by now; the Mac has it, the MacBook has it, the iPad has it, even Apple’s peripherals have it.
* It’s time to go back to the iPhone’s roots with the next iPhone. Plus, seeing those weathered iPhone 2G pictures floating around makes me long for the simpler days when I didn’t have to worry about shattering glass on both the front and the back of my phone.

* Apple, the glass was cool, but it’s time to head back to the design that you’re known for.
* It’s on every new Mac available, and will continue to become prevalent with each new Apple hardware release. At least throw in an optional 30-pin to Thunderbolt connector for those of us that have invested in new Apple hardware.

* I don’t know about you but I’m sick of waiting half an hour or more to sync my music library. Obviously this will be less of an issue once Apple’s cloud solution comes into focus, but it’s still nice to have local data for those times when you don’t have a reliable network connection.
* I honestly don’t see anything in that list that would be out of the question for the new iPhone. All of those options are certainly feasible, and might just come to fruition.
* What do you think? Do you think any of my aforementioned wishes are mere pipe dreams better suited for an alternate reality? Is there anything that you’re dying to see that I missed? I tried to keep this at more of a hardware level, as iOS 5 is a different beast altogether.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
