* If there is one consumer experience needing updating, it is that trip to an auto sales floor. Too often, the salesperson can only provide potential buyers with the most basic information. Luxury automaker BMW hopes to change all that, using Apple’s Genius model to answer consumer queries.
* Part of the BMW Genius Everywhere program to launch in the U.S. in 2014, young people armed with iPads will roam the automaker’s showrooms even before the sales staff get down to clinching the deal. The company becomes just the latest hoping to ignite more sales by taking a page from Apple’s wildly successful Geniuses who provide unassuming assistance and educate consumers on Apple gear…
* The new program aims “at educating customers without actually selling them any vehicles,” wrote CNET’s report on the Monday Advertising Age profile earlier in the week.
* These geniuses will be young, hip and with iPads in their hands, the traits BMW hopes will attract prosperous consumers who have grown accustomed to the atmosphere found at Apple stores.
* BMW is just the latest in a string of firms borrowing Apple’s success at offering their ow Geniuses. In the case of the car maker, the concept is aimed at consumers prior to a purchase.
* CNET notes:
* However, unlike most Apple genius efforts, which aim at handling issues with products already purchased and educating the community on its devices, BMW’s geniuses will provide insight prior to the purchase.
* Along with electronics giant Best Buy attempting to boost flagging sales by modeling stores after Apple, we reported in 2012 how the company produces stores where square footage value tops even Tiffany. Other well known brand, Samsung included, are attempting to replicate Apple’s holistic approach to retail.

* However, even the geniuses stumble.
* Apple had to backtrack from reports it was preparing to let go a number of Apple Store employees, a move met with a hugely negative response and resulting in firing of retail head John Browett who lasted only nine months (he found a new job at a fashion retailer).
* What’s your car buying experience like?
