* Instagram announced today it’s testing a new feature that will permit users of its mobile app for iPhone and iPad to go live with a friend.
* “Since introducing live video in November, millions of people have used it to connect with friends and followers in an authentic way,” said the company.
* “Now, you can have even more fun connecting with people in the moment.”
* To go live with a friend, tap a new icon in the bottom-right corner of the interface, then tap Add to invite anyone who’s currently watching. Once they join, you’ll see the screen split into two and your friend pop up right below you.
* Your two-person live broadcast can optionally be shared to Stories like other live videos as soon as the broadcast has ended. At any time during the broadcast, you can remove a friend and add someone else.
* In the same way, your friend can choose to exit your two-person broadcast at any time.
* Your viewers can like and comment as they follow along. This cool new feature is currently being tested with select Instagram users ahead of a wider rollout over the next few months.
* Instagram for iOS is available at no charge on App Store.
