* Low Power Mode is one of the new features of iOS 9 that allows you to keep your battery usage as low as possible throughout the day when you want to conserve battery life and you feel your battery level is getting to the point where you might not last until you can get to a charger.
* Unfortunately, while most of us enjoy reaping the benefits of Low Power Mode, whether we have a low battery level or not, iOS automatically disables the feature when your device gets charged up enough, forcing you to go to the Settings app and re-enable Low Power Mode manually.
* That’s where a new free jailbreak tweak in Cydia’s BigBoss repository called LowPowerMode is going to make your life a whole lot easier.
* After you’ve installed LowPowerMode on your jailbroken device, you’ll never have to turn Low Power Mode back on ever again. Low Power Mode will always be enabled on your device at all times, even when you charge your device up to 100%.
* This allows you to keep all of the features Low Power Mode offers to keep your device as battery-efficient as possible. As Apple notes in a support document, Low Power Mode gives you the following benefits to increase your battery life:
* It is worth noting however that when you use the LowPowerMode jailbreak tweak, you will still get the notification that says “Low Power Mode Turned Off – Battery sufficiently charged” when your device reaches a high charge level, but you’ll notice that despite the notification, Low Power Mode will remain turned on and your battery level indicator icon in the Status Bar will remain yellow, indicating Low Power Mode is enabled.

* Because I can relate to not wanting to manually enable Low Power Mode each and every time my device gets fully charged, I can see a jailbreak tweak like this being useful.
* Although Apple intends Low Power Mode for when your device is low on power and you want to conserve your battery life as much as possible to prevent your device from dying, I typically turn on Low Power Mode even when I’m fully charged because it’ll help my device last longer throughout the day.
* Anyone that uses Low Power Mode frequently in the way described above is going to love the LowPowerMode jailbreak tweak.
* My biggest gripe with the tweak is that it still shows that silly notification that Low Power Mode has been disabled when you reach a high enough charge level, despite the fact that what it’s saying isn’t really true because Low Power Mode is actually going to remain on. Apart from that, without a way to toggle the tweak on or off, Low Power Mode will stay on no matter what unless you uninstall the tweak.
* If you’re a big Low Power Mode user, you should definitely check out the LowPowerMode jailbreak tweak from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. It’s a free download that can help you take advantage of an iOS feature you love without wasting your time to toggle it back on all the time. The tweak is also very simple – with no options to configure, you can just install it and take advantage of what it has to offer.
