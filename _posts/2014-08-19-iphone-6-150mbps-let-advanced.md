* Apple’s upcoming iPhone 6 could feature support for faster LTE-Advanced networking which promises theoretical download speeds of up to 300Mbps. A claimed iPhone 6 logic board photo suggests Apple may have opted for the slower 150Mbps LTE-Advanced by replacing Qualcomm’s MDM9615 chip in prior iPhones with a MDM9625 part.
* Originally announced back in 2012, the MDM9625 chipset supports upload and download LTE-Advanced data speeds of 150Mbps versus the MDM9615 chip found in the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c which tops out at 100Mbps.
* A handful of the world’s carriers have only recently begun rolling out LTE-Advanced so Apple may have opted to support only the 150Mbps LTE-Advanced in anticipation of the faster 300Mbps roll-out…
* The image seen below has been shared by GeekBar on Weibo [Google Translate] and reposted by GforGames. Assuming it’s genuine, you can clearly see the Qualcomm MDM9625 LTE modem.

* According to a media release dated February 27, 2012, the MDM9625 chipset is fabricated on the 28-nanometer production process, making it more power-friendly, smaller and faster than its predecessor.
* It provides support for multiple mobile broadband technologies, including carrier aggregation and true LTE Category 4 with data rates of up to 150Mbps. Carrier aggregation basically bonds two 4G networks together in the area resulting in a big boost in performance.
* The MDM9625 chip does not, however, include support for Category 6 LTE that some high-end Android handsets have, like the Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A as well as the LG G3 Cat. 6.
* If it means anything, remember that VentureBeat’s questionable report earlier in the month claimed the iPhone 6 would support Category 6 LTE with data speeds of 300Mbps.
* Yesterday, GeekBar shared a claimed image of an iPhone 6 technical drawing, seen below. Originally, the source mistakenly interpreted the schematic as a proof that Apple’s in-house designed A8 processor powering the handset will feature 1GB of RAM, like the iPhone 5/5c/5s.

* Subsequently, however, it’s been determined that GeekBar confused DRAM included within the A8 chip for for a NAND flash storage chip with 1GB of special memory used exclusively to store the device boot firmware.
* The referenced PN65V chip was later identified as a Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip for mobile devices, NXP’s PN65 part. I’ve updated my article to reflect this finding.
* This is interesting not only because rumors have been calling for an NFC-enabled iPhone for ages, but in the light of the fact that NXP is an Apple supplier — the firm provides the M7 motion coprocessor for the iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display.
* At any rate, LTE-Advanced is currently at the very early stage and it’s going to take a year or two until Category 6 LTE with throughput speeds of 300Mbps becomes mainstream. For now, the technology is being tried and tested in Samsung’s home turf of South Korea.
* On June 1, local wireless provider SK Telecom announced it had become the world’s first telco to launch LTE Advanced network on a commercial basis..
* In the United States, carrier AT&T back in March started testing LTE-Advanced in Chicago. Verizon’s LTE-Advanced roadmap is largely unknown, while T-Mobile made it clear it has big plans for LTE-Advanced.
* Specifically, T-Mobile says its LTE-Advanced is three times faster than the 300Mbps standard adopted by its rivals because its technology is based on the IMT-Advanced specifications, which allows for cellular network data speeds of one gigabit per second.
