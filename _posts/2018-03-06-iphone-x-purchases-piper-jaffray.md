* Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson yesterday shared a new 1,500 person study he performed as to why people opted not to purchase a new iPhone. The results aren’t particularly surprising, noting three primary reasons for the hold off.
* The primary reason that prevented people from upgrading recently is because their current phone “works just fine”, which accounted for 44% of the responses. This is something we’ve heard often, especially considering the long life often accompanying Apple products.
* The second most frequently cited reason was that the new iPhone was simply “too expensive,” with 31% of the respondents choosing this as their answer.
* Lastly, the third most popular reason (with 8%), was that they prefer a larger screen than is currently offered on the iPhone X. An “Other” category made up the last 17% of respondents.
* Considering what is rumored for Apple’s iPhone lineup later this year, Apple could address concerns of 39% of those prospective buyers by introducing a new larger-screen iPhone X, as well as a new lower-cost model.
* The takeaway from our survey is that a larger screen and lower priced option would address the concerns of 40% of iPhone owners that have not upgraded. Despite investor uncertainty around iPhone X, we recommend owning AAPL on potential for a super-long cycle driven by a wider array of ‘X-gen’ devices.
* The study is certainly interesting and it’s intriguing to see values put to these oft-cited reasons. However, it doesn’t reveal anything particularly groundbreaking and the sample size isn’t especially large.
* Apple is widely thought to be debuting a new iPhone SE, a second-generation iPhone X as well as a new larger version of iPhone X later this year.
* What do you make of these survey results?
* Share your thoughts below.
