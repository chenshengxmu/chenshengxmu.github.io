* Springtomize 2 — the ridiculously in-depth Springboard tweak package — was updated today to include native iPad support among other things.
* This means that you can now run it in full screen mode without having to enable the iPad’s 2x mode for iPhone apps.
* It also means that it gains a few new iPad centric features along the way. Check out our video walkthrough of the new Springtomize 2 in action…
* Here is the full change log for this new version of Springtomize 2:
* New:
* Fixed:
* My favorite new feature is the ability to have a custom amount of icons in both portrait and landscape mode. The custom icons dynamically change just like they do on a stock iPad.
* You will need a jailbroken iDevice in order to use Springtomize 2. For those who already own the tweak, this is a free update. If you want a better idea of all of the features that come with Springtomize 2, don’t forget to check out our in-depth review.
