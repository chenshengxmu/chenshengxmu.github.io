* Upon launching the app on your Apple Watch, you will be presented two buttons: one for directions to your home, another for directions to your work, two locations that can easily be set up from within Google Maps on iPhone. A list of recent routes is also displayed on the screen to quickly browse and access your latest requested directions.
* Pressing firmly on the screen gives you the option to choose between driving, walking or transit directions.

* The full changeling of version 4.11.0 is as follow:
* Google Maps is a free app in the App Store.
