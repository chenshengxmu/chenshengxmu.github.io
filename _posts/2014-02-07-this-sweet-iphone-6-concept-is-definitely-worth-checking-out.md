title: This sweet iPhone 6 concept is definitely worth checking out...

* We’ve run a few iPhone 6 concepts here on iDownloadBlog, but none has captured our attention like the newest work by Italy’s established 3D artist Federico Ciccarese who took a crack at envisioning what a large-screened iPhone could look like. Like most mockups, this is one concept that Apple most likely will never make, probably.
* Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean a guy can’t dream, no? With that in mind, do take a look at Federico’s latest batch of iPhone 6 mockups and then chime in with your thoughts down in the comments…
* He writes on his blog that the larger canvas would allow for the Home screen icons to be reorganized so, for instance, a 5.5-inch device would add a sixth icon to the Dock.

* I’ve always loved the tapered back of the iPhone 3GS and it would make sense to give a larger device a tapered back for a better grip in your hand and an overall thinner appearance.

* The 4.7-inch device would have a resolution of 750-by-1,338 pixels and a larger 5.5-inch iPhone would max out at 878-by-1,568 pixels. By comparison, the current iPhone 5/5s/5c have a 640-by-1,138 screen.

* Note the sexy edge-to-edge design.
* A design with virtually no side bezels would make possible an iPhablet with a five-inch screen that wasn’t jumbo-sized and allowed for one-hand use. I’m not sure whether such 100 percent edge-to-edge screen is feasible, but apparently Apple’s new plant in Messa, Arizona will be building sapphire-hardened front glass for the upcoming iPhones.

* The next iPhone’s biggest unknown would have to be its design, not the form factor.
* The current Unibody construction where the steel frame doubles as the antenna system has been around for nearly four years now.
* The iPhone 4 in 2010 ushered in that design. Of course, it went on through several revisions (the Verizon iPhone 4, the iPhone 4s) needed to address the widely reported antenna non-issue.
* Having inherited that design, the iPhone 5 replaced the glass cover on the back with an all-metal two-tone backplate. Still, the fact remains that there’re only minor visible differences between the 2010 iPhone 4 and the 2013 iPhone 5s in terms of the chassis.
* So, is Apple going to give as a radical new iPhone look this year or simply rehash the four-year-old design? Only time will tell – and there’s only so much ways one could make an all-glass frame.
* Apple in 2010 signed an exclusive agreement with Caltech spinoff Liquidmetal Technologies (later re-newing that agreement) which gave it exclusive worldwide rights to use the advanced alloy for consumer electronics purposes.
* I’ve been keeping my fingers crossed for a Liquidmetal iPhone for a while now.
* Could 2014 be the year Apple goes Liquidmetal?
