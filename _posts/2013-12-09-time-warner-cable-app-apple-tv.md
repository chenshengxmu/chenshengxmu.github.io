* Time Warner Cable’s Rob Marcus announced this morning that the company plans to add another platform to the list of those that can access the TWC TV app this week. The app enables TWC subscribers to stream live channels and watch videos on demand.
* Now, he didn’t say which platform it is exactly, but given that the app is already available on Roku, Xbox 360, and various smart TVs and mobile devices, there aren’t many options left. And this of course has led to speculation that it’s finally coming to Apple TV…
* CNET’s Joan Solsman has the story:
* “Time Warner Cable incoming Chief Executive Rob Marcus said the company this week will add another platform to the list that can access its TWC TV app, which enables subscribers to stream live channels and watch videos on demand. Apple TV has been rumored all year to be next for TWC TV.“
* And Solsman’s right. We’ve been tracking this thing for several months now, and have seen multiple reports claiming that TWC channels are coming to Apple TV. Bloomberg even added its weight to the narrative in July, saying it was happening within ‘a few months.’
* Apple’s hockey puck-shaped device has come a long way since it made its debut in 2010. What started as an AirPlay accessory with Netflix access has turned into a full-blown media device with apps from HBO, ESPN, Disney, SkyNews, various Pro sports leagues, and more.

* But while Apple continues to update its ATV software, it hasn’t shown off new hardware in nearly two years. It’s rumored to be working on a more advanced set-top box, and possibly a full-blown television set, but we’ve seen little to no evidence that either product exists.
* Again, Apple TV is the most likely platform for TWC to add this week, but it’s worth noting that there’s another possibility: Chromecast. It would be odd if Google’s 6-month old platform got the app before Apple, but it’s well-known that cable providers are leery of the iPad-maker.
* Thoughts?
