* Rockstar Games is celebrating tenth year of its Grand Theft Auto series and said it will be releasing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on iOS and Android platforms later this fall. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City debuted on October 29, 2002 on the PlayStation 2 and I’ve had lots of fun playing the various installments in the series throughout the years.
* The new game should arrive approximately a year following the release of Grand Theft Auto III for iOS (still not updated for the iPhone 5 and Retina graphics). An Anniversary Edition of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for iOS and Android devices “will bring the full experience to mobile devices”, Rockstar said. They are mentioning native high-resolution graphics and several enhancements that will be unique to the iOS and Android platforms…
* Rockstar Games wrote it will release  a series of commemorative assets to celebrate the anniversary, including never-before-seen artwork and a brand new anniversary trailer “highlighting some of the most iconic scenes and music from the game”.
* And if you’re a collector, perhaps a limited run of collectible promotional items will pique your interest, coming to the Rockstar Warehouse soon.
* Not sure about you, but I’m a big fan of games and spent countless hours pulling shady jobs in the various scam cities that the series featured. I’ve enjoyed the series on both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles and am definitely looking forward to a Grand Theft Auto release on the iOS platform.
* Stay tuned as we updated you on the game’s progress.
