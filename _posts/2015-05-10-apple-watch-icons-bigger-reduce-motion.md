title: How to make Apple Watch app icons bigger and easier to tap

* We’re still working our way through all of the Apple Watch settings for our complete Apple Watch Guide, but here’s something that Reddit user ineedlesssleep stumbled upon that I found particularly useful.
* By turning on the Reduce Motion option in the Apple Watch preferences, you can make all of the app icons on your Apple Watch Home screen the same size. This means that all of the app icons will be big just like the app icons in the middle of the interface, and thus will be just as easy to tap.
* I find that this option makes the Home Screen on Apple Watch simpler, as everything is larger and more consistent across the board. Watch our video demonstration inside to see what I mean.
* Step 1: Open the Settings app
* Step 2: Tap General
* Step 3: Tap Accessibility

* Step 4: Tap Reduce Motion
* Step 5: Enable the Reduce Motion switch
* As you might expect, you can also enable Reduce Motion from the Apple Watch companion app on your paired iPhone. Here’s how to do so:
* Step 1: Open the Apple Watch companion app on your iPhone
* Step 2: Tap the My Watch tab
* Step 3: Tap General
* Step 4: Tap Accessibility

* Step 5: Tap Reduce Motion
* Step 6: Enable the Reduce Motion switch
* Once you go back to the Home screen, you’ll notice larger icons across the entire Home screen interface. On my 42mm Apple Watch, the icons look particularly large and in charge.
* So what exactly does Reduce Motion aim to accomplish? Here’s the official word from Apple:
* Reduce Motion Limits animation and automatic resizing of the Apple Watch user interface on the Home screen and when launching and exiting apps.
* As you can see, the Reduce Motion feature on the Apple Watch is somewhat different from the iPhone version of Reduce Motion. Since the Apple Watch Home screen features different sized app icons based on their location on screen, this had to be incorporated into the Reduce Motion setting as well. Like the iPhone, though, Reduce Motion also eliminates the motion-based animation that occurs when launching or closing apps. Instead of the complex animation, users are treated to a simplistic fade in and fade out animation instead.
* Of course, there are tradeoffs to enabling the Reduce Motion option, and you’ll need to consider these tradeoffs before fully committing to the setting.
* First and foremost, you lose the slick animations that happen when launching and closing apps. You might not think that’s a big deal, and I’d tend to agree with you, but you’re still missing out on some of the animation that Apple designers felt were important enough to include by default.
* Perhaps more importantly, though, enabling Reduce Motion means potentially less app icons on screen at once. Since all icons are the same size with Reduce Motion enabled, there’s less room to fit icons that would have normally fit on screen due to their small size on the outskirts of the interface.
* Compare this image below:

* I’ve superimposed a Home screen with Reduce Motion disabled with a screenshot with Reduce Motion enabled. You can clearly see some app icons that don’t appear on the screen with Reduce Motion on, but do appear with it off. Notice the lack of the Slack, Yelp, Drafts, ESPN app, and others. Since you can easily launch those apps with small app icons using a normal tap—as seen in our video above—there is a difference here that must be considered.
* After mulling over it for a while, I think I’m going to keep the Reduce Motion feature enabled on my Apple Watch. The larger tap targets are just too good to pass up, even if it means more potential scrolling on the Home screen to find the apps I need. What about you?
