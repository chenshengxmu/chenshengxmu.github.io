* It’s Thursday and you know what that means, no? That’s right, another previously paid app has gone free for a week as part of Apple’s ongoing Free App of the Week promotion.
* This time around, it’s Pursuit of Light, a cool action adventure game set in a mystery world created by developer Lemon Jam Studio and released by publisher Zhipeng Wang.
* Regularly a 99-cent download, Pursuit of Light features intuitive touch controls, eighty challenging dreams, beautiful music and design, Game Center support and other perks. The game has you playing as a little girl who strives desperately to find the light and get out of the endless dream she’s found herself in.
* Of course, there are many traps and numerous dangers hidden along the way to make things more interesting. You control the game’s protagonist by the spell of moon and star which helps you avoid the dangers and jump to the end.

* “As you make your way across a dreamlike path every step is fraught with peril,” App Store editors teased.
* “The only way forward is through a maze of obstacles: hit the wrong button just a single time, and you’ll perish. Experimentation and careful timing pay off, but the game’s ethereal visuals and delightful audio and what’ll leave you wonderstruck.”
