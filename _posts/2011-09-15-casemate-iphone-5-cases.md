* Hot on the heels of the purported iPhone 5 screen protector surfacing this morning, BGR is reporting that more accessories have turned up in the next-generation iPhone department. Case-maker Case-Mate just unveiled 6 new iPhone 5 cases.
* Sure, we’ve already seen several cases that are reportedly for Apple’s next smartphone. But not from a company as well-known as Case-Mate. And the phone design depicted in the pictures is better looking than anything we’ve seen so far…
* The form factor shown in Case-Mate’s photos matches up fairly well with previous iPhone 5 case designs we’ve seen. The mute button is on the opposite side of the volume controls, and the body looks slimmer and more tapered than the previous model.
* The images even depict a device with an aluminum backing, something we’ve been hearing for several months.
* Given the fact that accessory-makers have a history of exposing the design of Apple products ahead of announcement, we had to give these cases some attention. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t a bit skeptical.
* As many have suggested, this could very well be a publicity stunt — a move to generate website traffic. However, the design falls in line with previous rumors, and all of them seem to point to the same thing. Caste-Mate isn’t an obscure accessory maker, either. It would be a shame for the company to put its entire reputation with Apple and its customers on the line with a move like this. I guess we’ll know for sure in a few weeks.
* What do you think of this iPhone 5 design? Is it an improvement over the iPhone 4?
* UPDATE: Case-Mate has pulled the case renders from its site. The wrath of Cupertino is not to be trifled with.
