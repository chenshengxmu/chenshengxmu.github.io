* Following Fall introduction, Apple’s iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad lineup hit the refurbished store in mid-March 2013, knocking $50 off of some models. In a sign that the company could be clearing stock of refurbished iPads in anticipation of next-generation models, Apple today has again slashed prices of its iPad 4 and iPad mini refurbished devices by as much as fifteen percent, enough to net you a cool $40 saving on top-of-the-line models with 64 gigabytes of storage…
* Here, the new iPad mini and iPad 4 refurbished prices at the online Apple Store:
* iPad mini – 16 GB Wi-Fi: $279, down from $299 previously and $329 brand-new – 32 GB Wi-Fi: $359, down from $389 previously and $429 brand-new – 64 GB Wi-Fi: $439, down from $489 previously and $529 brand-new
* – 16 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $389, down from $429 previously and $459 brand-new – 32 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $469, down from $519 previously and $559 brand-new – 64 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $549, down from $619 previously and $659 brand-new
* Fourth-generation iPad – 16 GB Wi-Fi: $419, down from $449 previously and $499 brand-new – 32 GB Wi-Fi: $499, down from $549 previously and $599 brand-new – 64 GB Wi-Fi: $579, down from $649 previously and $699 brand-new
* – 16 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $529, down from $579 previously and $629 brand-new – 32 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $609, down from $679 previously and $729 brand-new – 64 GB Wi-Fi + Cellular: $689, down from $779 previously and $829 brand-new
* The 128GB iPad 4, introduced in February, is notably absent from the refurbished store.
* Additionally, Apple’s iPod touches popped up on the refurbished Apple store in mid-April, with discounts starting at $30 for the entry-level fourth-generation model and going all the way up to $50 for the latest fifth-generation variants.
* And later that month, refurbished 3G iPad 2 appeared with a $180 discount, the cellular iPad 3 saw a deep $170 discount and the refurbished seventh-generation iPod nano was offered with a 13 percent discount.
* Apple tests refurbished devices for defects, replaces their battery and outer shell and covers them with a brand new one-year AppleCare warranty.
* There has been some commotion lately over Apple’s practice of replacing faulty iPhones with refurbished models, but a new report alleges the company could start repairing broken iPhones, iPod touches and iPads starting next month.
