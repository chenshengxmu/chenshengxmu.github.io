* Following yesterday’s release of Microsoft’s new Hub Keyboard for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad with Office 365 integration, the Windows maker today issued a refresh to its Translator app in the App Store.
* Bumped to version 2.13, the software has gained support for a total of 34 new languages alongside a pair of crucial feature additions: offline mode and a brand new extensions for Safari which lets you translate webpages with a tap.
* Offline support allows the application to translate at “near-online quality” even when your device is not connected to the Internet. Before Translator can be used in offline mode, you must download one or more language packages to access translation services without Internet connectivity.

* At the time of this writing, more than forty language packs were available for download in offline mode, including Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Korean.
* Another major new feature, Translator’s Safari extensions lets you translate text in webpages in Safari without leaving the browser or switching apps.
* You must first enable the Safari extension in app settings. Then, whenever you find yourself on a webpage in a language you don’t understand just choose Microsoft Translator in the list of available extensions in Safari’s Share sheet and the text of the webpage will be translated automatically to your chosen language.

* Microsoft says these new features help make their app the most comprehensive free translation solution for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. The full list of supported languages in Translator is available on the Microsoft website.
* Last month, Microsoft added real-time speech-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities to its Translation API. These features have been available in Skype for over a year and in Translator for iOS and Android since late 2015. With the refreshed API, businesses can add these speech translation capabilities to their applications or services.
