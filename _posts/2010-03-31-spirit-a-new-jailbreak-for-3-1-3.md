title: Spirit - A New Jailbreak For iPhone 3.1.3
---
* Just a few days after GeoHot released a video of a potential untethered jailbreak for 3.1.3, a new video by hacker Comex emerged on the internet showing a new userland jailbreak called Spirit.
* UPDATE: Spirit has been released. You can see my Spirit jailbreak tutorial here.
* A userland jailbreak is a browser-based jailbreak, similar to the good old JailbreakMe.com, which allows you to jailbreak your iPhone simply by visiting a site from Safari and agreeing to jailbreak your iPhone. If you used JailbreakMe.com before, you will probably remember how easy and quick it was. As for me, I remember going visit the Apple Store and jailbreak a bunch of iPhones on display for the heck of it…
* Presumably, Spirit will work for every device on 3.1.3 with the newer bootrom, and potentially even the iPad. It’s interesting to note that this is an untethered jailbreak.
* For those of you that might be skeptical about this video, MuscleNerd confirmed that it is indeed a legit userland  jailbreak.
* The question on everybody’s lips is when will this new jailbreak be available? Well, there is no ETA at the time. Now that Geohot has been challenged though, I suspect that he’s going to rush to release his new jailbreak, which in turn will kinda force Comex to release his too. Only time will tell.
