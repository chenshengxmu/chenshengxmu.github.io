* When Apple previewed its major iOS 11.3 release coming this Spring, it acknowledge that a pair of new features related to battery health and power management would be coming “in a later beta release,” and now they’ve provided a more specific timeframe.
* This tidbit came via a statement given to Axios regarding yesterday’s news that the US government is investigating whether or not Apple may have violated securities laws following the disclosure that an iOS software update brought CPU throttling to select iPhone models.
* “These features will be included in a developer release next month and a user release this Spring,” noted the Cupertino, California-headquartered technology company.
* By the sound of it, it doesn’t seem that Apple is planning to include battery health and power management features into a future iOS 11.3 public beta release, but I could be wrong.
* The features would recommend when users should consider replacing their battery and let them see if power management is being used to prevent unexpected shutdowns.
* Most importantly, users will be able to turn CPU throttling off if they so choose.
* Battery health information will be available for iPhone 6 and later. CPU throttling will work on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
* Stay tuned to iDownloadBlog as we’ll be taking a deep dive into these exciting new features as soon as Apple delivers them in an upcoming iOS 11.3 developer release.
