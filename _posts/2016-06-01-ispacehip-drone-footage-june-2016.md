* As is their wont, Duncan Sinfield and Matthew Roberts posted their latest iSpaceship drone footage in razor-sharp 4K resolution. The videos show progress made vs. last month, especially regarding the solar panels on the roof and an underground theatre for keynotes and press events.
* You can also see that additional curved-glass panes, window shades and solar panels have been installed on the ring-shaped building.
* Apple anticipates it’ll be moving in by early 2017.

* By the way, impressive job flying the drones!
* These two drone pilots have been sending their expensive flying machines to the skies on a regular basis in order to film how the iSpaceship site has been progressing, and we appreciate their work and enthusiasm very much.
