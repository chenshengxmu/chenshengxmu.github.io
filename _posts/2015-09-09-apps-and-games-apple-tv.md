* Apple on Wednesday announced a new version of the Apple TV, and it is awesome. It has a redesigned remote control, a refreshed interface, and support for voice commands via Siri. But what really pushes the device over the top is its support for native apps and games.
* As expected, the next-generation set-top box features an App Store, and Apple invited some developers up on stage today to give us an idea of its potential. The game you see above is a Wii Sports-like motion game, called Beats Sports, from Rock Band developer Harmonix.
* Another game demoed on stage was the popular arcade-hopper Crossy Road. Players control the action via the new Apple TV remote, or others can join in on the fun using their iPhone or iPad. The developers say cooperative play is where the new device really shines.

* Apps were also demoed on stage, with Apple inviting up the folks from Gilt and Major League Baseball. The Apple TV Gilt app will allow customers to shop from their couches, and the new MLB app, of course, will take watching Major League Baseball content to the next level.

* Apple says the developer kit for the new Apple TV will be available today, and the device itself will be available sometime in October. It’s worth noting that tvOS is Apple’s fourth operating system, and Apple says developers can make universal apps for iPhone, iPad and tvOS.
