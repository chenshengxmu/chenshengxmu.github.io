* pod2g has been working feverishly to give us an untethered jailbreak for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2. While the untether for A4-based iOS devices and older on iOS 5.0.1 has already been released, the A5 untether has yet to see the light of day.
* Now, pod2g has listed 3 legendary jailbreak hackers, planetbeing, MuscleNerd, and p0sixninja, to help him with the A5 jailbreak for iOS 5:
* @planetbeing, the legendary hacker behind iPhone Linux and lot of jailbreaks (http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Planetbeing) has joined the A5 research!
* The famous @MuscleNerd (http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:MuscleNerd), the leader of the iPhone Dev Team, who did a lot of tests for Corona and whom integrated it and made it simple in redsn0w is willing to help also.
* And last, but not least @p0sixninja (http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Posixninja), the leader of the Chronic Dev Team, and my partner for years on iPhone security research has started to code and fuzz the Apple sandbox.
* As pod2g says on his blog, he now has a “dream team” to help him test and release the A5 untethered jailbreak available for the public.
