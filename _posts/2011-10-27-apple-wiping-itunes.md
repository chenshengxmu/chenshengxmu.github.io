* During its “Let’s Talk iPhone” event earlier this month, Apple announced that its highly anticipated iTunes Match service would launch by the end of October. And seeing as how it’s October 27th, we can’t be too far away from a public release.
* Apple is certainly moving the pieces into place. Last week we reported that an iTunes Match toggle popped up in the iOS Settings application, and last night developers received an email stating that their Match libraries would be reset today…

* Apple unveiled iTunes Match at its WWDC event back in June. The $24.99/year service mirrors a user’s music library in iCloud so it can be accessed from anywhere without the need to spend hours uploading files. It’ll be interesting to see how popular this gets.
* Do you plan on signing up?
