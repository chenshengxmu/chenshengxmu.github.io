title: This is a Jailbroken iPad 2 [Updated]

* A couple days ago, pod2g shared with us the video of a jailbroken iPhone 4S. What could be considered as a tease is actually a way to keep us updated about the progress of the various teams working on the jailbreak.
* Today, pod2g teased us a little more by posting the image of a jailbroken iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1 on his blog…
* The photo comes with a few words:
* No more to say !
* What is this supposed to mean? That the jailbreak for iPhone 4S and iPad 2 is nearing completion? We’ve heard the same encouraging message for a couple weeks now, so let’s not get our hopes up quite yet.
* So far, only older devices running iOS 5.0.1 can be jailbroken, using PwnageTool, RedSn0w, or even Sn0wBreeze. The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 sport Apple’s A5 chip which is currently immune to exploits used for the latest untethered jailbreak. This is something that hopefully won’t last long.
* UPDATE: Looks like pod2g removed the image and post from his blog. We’re not sure what it means but if I had to take a guess I’d say other jailbreak hackers such as MuscleNerd kindly asked him not to show off any jailbreak until it’s ready. I could be wrong though. What’s your guess?
