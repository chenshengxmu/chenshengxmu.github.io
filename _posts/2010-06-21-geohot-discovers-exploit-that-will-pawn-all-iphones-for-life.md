title: GeoHot Discovers Exploit That Will Pwn All iPhones for Life
---
* We hadn’t heard from GeoHot in a while. The little genius hacker might come back to the front of the stage with a new exploit called pwned4life. At Nuit du Hack, a hacking convention held in Paris, GeoHot indeed mentioned that he had found a new exploit that can pwn all iPhones for life, including the yet-to-be-released iPhone 4.
* I’m not sure yet what pwnedforlife will do exactly but that sure sounds like some good news. Check out this video for more details.
