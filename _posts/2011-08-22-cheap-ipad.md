* Are you in the market for a new tablet? Have you thought about an iPad before, but couldn’t justify dropping $500? If you answered yes to either of those questions, we’ve got some good news for you.
* MacRumors sounded the alarm this morning that Apple has lowered the price on its refurbished iPads. The tablet that started it all has been available through Apple.com at $399 for a while now, but the price dropped another $100 bucks over the weekend…
* If you’re not someone who rushed out to get a $99 HP Touchpad, you’ll be happy to know that Apple has also placed discontinued tablets on a fire sale. Consumers looking to score a refurbished iPad can pick one up from Apple.com for just $299.
* This is by far the lowest price that Apple’s ever offered on the hit tablet, and even though it’s refurbished, is still a solid deal. The recycled iPads come with the same warranties as new ones do, and include a new battery and back. $300 for an iPad? Where do I sign?
* UPDATE: Aaaaaand Apple is sold out of the 16GB model at $299. You can get the 32GB model at $399. Still a great deal.
