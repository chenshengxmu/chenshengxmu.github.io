* Potentially lost in all of the hype over the huge iOS 9.3 beta 1 release, was tvOS 9.2. This release was no slouch either, as it brings a much-wanted addition to the forth generation Apple TV. In this video, I’ll showcase many of the new features, including Bluetooth keyboard support, folder support, the redesigned App Switcher, and the new stock Podcasts app. Have a look…
* Bluetooth keyboard support

* Bluetooth keyboard support headlines a solid beta release. Connecting a Bluetooth keyboard is super easy and straightforward. Being able to input text using the physical keyboard results in a more refined text input experience.
* Folders

* It’s been long suspected that the implementation of folders in tvOS was only a matter of when, and tvOS 9.2 beta 1 is that time. To be honest, creating and managing folders on the Apple TV feels a bit weird, because you’re using the Touch surface on the Siri remote to move app icons around on the Home screen. You don’t have the same 1:1 input ratio like you have when using your finger on the iPhone’s Home screen, so it seems a bit disconnected and “floaty”.
* Redesigned App Switcher

* I’ve heard some complaints about the new App Switcher redesign, but I think it looks pretty good. If anything, it seems to be a bit snappier than the previous App Switcher.
* Podcast app

* It’s weird that there’s still no native Podcast app on the Apple Watch, but we’ll take what we can get. The presence of a Podcast app on the Apple TV just makes sense. The way it handles podcast show notes is pretty horrendous looking, though.
* All in all, a pretty solid update for something that’s not a major release. The headlining feature is, of course, the ability to use Bluetooth keyboards with the Apple TV. That makes typing a much less painful process than it was before. Even with support for the iOS Remote App, I find that a physical Bluetooth keyboard is always the superior experience when it comes to text input.
