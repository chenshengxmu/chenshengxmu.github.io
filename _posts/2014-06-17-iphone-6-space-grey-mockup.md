* Earlier this morning, we showed you new photos of a meticulously designed iPad Air 2 dummy unit with Touch ID incorporated into its Home button.
* And now, a fresh batch of purported iPhone 6 manufacturing mockups has surfaced, depicting what a Space Gray variant of Apple’s upcoming bigger and thinner iPhone model could look like.
* Credited to sources in Japan and Korea, the images show the purported mockup next to an iPhone 5s and HTC’s One smartphone…
* Published by Japanese publication ASCII.jp and Korean blog Seeko [via GforGames], the photos appear to depict a 4.7-inch variant of the iPhone 6 featuring a noticeably thinner appearance.
* That round flash hole on the back never ceases to puzzle me.

* As you know, the iPhone 5s has a pill-shaped opening for Apple’s new Tru-Tone dual-LED flash. Now, I have a hard time believing they’ve switched back to a single-flash design out of the blue.
* That being said, I think it’s fairly safe to speculate that Apple’s engineers have found a way to combine the two separate flashes into a single unit.

* The round-shaped flash hole is consistent with previous leaks.
* Pictured right below: a nice comparison between the 4.7-inch dummy unit, the four-inch iPhone 5s and the five-inch HTC One.

* If Apple is indeed sticking to the existing dual-LED flash design, then either all of the leaks showing a round flash hole are inaccurate or represent an abandoned iPhone prototype.
* Could Apple have been taking us all for a ride all this time?
* I guess that’s a viable possibility given Tim Cook’s promise to double-down on secrecy and the fact that no one was expecting such a flurry of surprising WWDC announcements.
* Rumors have it that the iPhone 6 could feature a 2K resolution Retina screen and have NFC and wireless charging, with a bigger 5.5-inch model possibly commanding a $100 premium.
* With all these legitimate form factors being under consideration, Apple reckoned it should make developers’ life easier so it’s made a brand new Adaptive Display framework to give apps intelligence to respond to screen size changes properly.
* September can’t come soon enough…
