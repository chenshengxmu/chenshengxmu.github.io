* Like many photo-syncing apps, Google’s Photos online service and the mobile app provide an optional feature that automatically backs up to the cloud every image and video in a user’s photo library. Apple, too, offers such a feature with iCloud Photo Library but its free five-gigabyte iCloud storage tier is no match for Google Photos unlimited cloud storage for your (recompressed) images (up to 16MP) and videos (up to 1080p). To drive that point home, they’ve put together an amusing new ad solely focused on that feature.
* “Automatically backup all your photos and videos for free, so your memories stay safe, no matter what you do to your phone,” says Google.
* I’ll just let the new ad speak for itself.
* This is the second Google Photos ad in less than a month.
* Last week, a “Storage Full” ad for Google Photos took some well-deserved potshot at Apple’s easily criticized decision to ship iPhones with sixteen gigabytes of storage.
* Here’s that ad.
* Google Photos is available in a browser at google.com/photos and on mobile devices as a native app for iOS and Android.
* Grab Google Photos free from the App Store.
* I remain committed to using iCloud Photo Library and am happily paying for my iCloud storage because it’s all deeply integrated, just works and gives me a piece of mind knowing that my photos and videos are always backed up to the cloud in their original resolution, without recompressing them to make the uploads faster.
* What did you think of the new Google Photos ad? I find these videos quite amusing, definitely relevant and up to the point. Please, Google, make some more!
