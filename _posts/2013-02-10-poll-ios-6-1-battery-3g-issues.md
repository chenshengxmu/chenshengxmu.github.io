* Like any software release, the January 28 iOS 6.1 firmware update did fix some known bugs, but also has introduced a new set of issues. Specifically, the update is said to contain a bug that affects your iPhone’s battery life and 3G performance.
* The battery inefficiencies could be related to an Exchange bug, clever people at AOL have learnt). Quick searches on the Apple Support Communities forum for iOS 6.1 battery and iOS 6.1 3G clearly prove these issues are more widespread than originally thought. While some people are seeing their iPhone 5 battery life dropping after updating to iOS 6.1, others are bitching about overheating issues.
* To make matters worse, Vodafone advised its UK customers against upgrading to iOS 6.1 until Apple fixes 3G hiccups, which include the occasional difficulty in connecting to the network to make or receive calls or texts or connecting to the mobile Internet.
* What are you seeing?
* Those of you who updated to iOS 6.1, please cast your vote now (multiple choices allowed).
* Some of you are wondering why there isn’t an option for none of the above. Easy: you don’t vote unless you’ve experienced the above bugs.
* I like to keep things simple.
* iOS 6.1 issues: overheating, 3G, battery performance
* Some folks on Apple’s support forum suspect something must be running in the background, even after closing all the apps, to cause the battery drain. Indeed, this has been true many times over with Apple’s previous firmware updates.
* A bunch of things in iOS could be blamed for the battery performance problem.
* There’s no sure way of pinpointing the root of the problem until Apple issues an advisory (or a maintenance update). If you wanted to get down and dirty, you could establish the culprit yourself by disabling all services in Settings and then re-enabling one by one to see which one has an impact on your 3G or battery performance.
* Hint: Locations services is always a good place to start.
