* With two weeks left until the rumored October 17 presser, we’re again beginning to see parts thought to belong to Apple’s mini iPad. An Ukrainian publication today published four images said to depict the iPad mini chassis featuring a SIM tray, suggesting the device will come in both WiFi and WiFi + Cellular varieties, like its 9.7-inch sibling. Additionally, the images show front and back panels, display assembly and strangely no change for the headphone jack which remains on the top…
* Russian-language UkrainianiPhone.com (via 9to5Mac) reportedly got these parts from a Chinese factory source.
* Notice the headphone jack on the top, which is in stark contrast to other leaks and the new design of the iPhone 5 and iPod touch.
* As depicted above, the bottom also has a small port, likely for the new Lightning connector.

* The rear panel revelas a tray that could be for the new and smaller Nano SIM card standard, first used commercially on the iPhone 5. If the part is legit, Apple should provide the iPad mini in both WiFi and cellular flavors (a cellular version of the Nexus 7 is in the works).
* Pictured below: the front panel with a hole for the home button and a smaller one at the top, presumably for a forward-facing FaceTime camera. Another notable: white looks as expected, but black sure reminds me of the anodized aluminum appearance on the black & sating iPhone 5.

* Notice the thinner side bezels we first heard about last month.
* Previously published rumors and leaked parts indicate that the iPad mini could be nearly as thin as the iPod touch, whose body is just 6.1mm deep.
* Developer Steve Stroughton Smith noted on Twitter that “the panel is identical to any causal search for the Kindle Fire”.

* The back plate with the Apple logo and the iPad moniker suggest no name change.
* Instead of the iPad mini or iPad air (seriously, did anyone think Apple will adorn the gizmo with such a nonsensical suffix?), Apple will probably simply call it the iPad.
* What do you think, are these parts real or not-so-elaborate fakes?
* Did you notice anything else worth mentioning in these photos?
