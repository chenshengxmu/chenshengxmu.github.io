* A judge in California this morning decided to hold off on a ruling related to Apple’s case against Samsung, meaning Cupertino won’t be able to impose a sales ban on Galaxy Tab tablet sales in the United States. Apple’s also been dealt another blow in Germany as a court said it’s unlikely to grant them the same victory against Motorola’s tablet as it’d done with last year’s sales ban of the Galaxy 10.1 tablet…
* Bloomberg has the story:
* Apple Inc. was denied its renewed request for a ban on U.S. sales of Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer while the case is still before a federal court of appeals.
* But why?
* U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said yesterday that she doesn’t have jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington hasn’t issued a mandate yet. The judge said Apple can renew its request once the court in Washington issues its ruling.
* And in another story, Bloomberg explains the Motorola ban situation in Germany:
* Apple Inc. will probably lose its bid for a sales ban on Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.’s Xoom tablet computer in Germany, a Dusseldorf court said.
* The German court that banned Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy 10.1 tablet sales last year is unlikely to grant Apple the same victory against Motorola Mobility’s device, Presiding Judge Johanna Brueckner-Hofmann said at a Dusseldorf hearing. The assessment is preliminary and may change after today’s arguments are reviewed. A ruling is scheduled for July 17.
* Not sure about you, but I’m so over this legal crap.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook met with his Samsung counterpart last month for court-mediated patent settlement discussion in San Francisco.
* The talks fell apart.
* Cook was so right, patent wars are indeed “a pain in the ass”.
* I just wish they settled so we could stop reporting on this nonsense and focus on the stuff that matters.
* You?
