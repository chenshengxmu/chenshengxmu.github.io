* As the new iPads begin arriving in stores and on doorsteps, iFixit has gotten its hands on an iPad Air 2 and performed its usual teardown ritual. Upon popping the tablet open, the team discovered a more powerful processor, 2GB of RAM, and a smaller battery.
* The processor is of course the new A8X, which is similar to the A8 in the iPhone 6 but with improved graphics. The RAM is comprised of two 1GB Elpida F8164A3MD sticks placed on either side of the A8X, and the battery is of the 27.62 Whr; 7,340 mAh variety.

* It’s worth noting that it’s smaller than the battery in the first generation Air, which was rated a 8,827 mAh/32.9 Whr. The change obviously had to do with Apple’s effort to try and thin out the new tablet, and some reviewers pointed out the drop in battery life.
* Also interesting is that there’s an NFC module in the Air 2—the same NXP 65V10 model found in the new iPhones. It however does not appear to have an antenna, which is why Apple says the tablet won’t be capable of making in-store purchases via Apple Pay.
