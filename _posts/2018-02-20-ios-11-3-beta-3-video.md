* iOS 11.3 is inching closer and closer to release. Beta 3 is out with a few noticeable changes from the last beta, two weeks ago.
* The biggest changes of note is the latest beta now supports the iPod Touch, and AirPlay 2 has been completely removed.

* The removal of AirPlay 2 is the biggest disappointment for me, as I’ve been really enjoying it in the past two betas, and was really hoping for further refinements here in beta 3.
* In other changes of note, it overall feels more stable, we’ve seen bugs fixed (such as the placeholder text that appears when deleting a message thread), and it still has solid performance on the geekbench test.
* iOS 11.3 is still bringing a ton of new user-facing features including Messages in iCloud, Health Records with partnering medical networks, several new Animoji, and more.
* Check out our hands-on with beta 2 to see what changed last time.
* What do you think of beta 3? Did you install it? Let us know down in the comments.
