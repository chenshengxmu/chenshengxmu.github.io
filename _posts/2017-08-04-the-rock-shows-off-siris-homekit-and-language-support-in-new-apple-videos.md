* Apple on Friday released a pair of new Siri mini-ads featuring Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock.
* Titled “Leg Day” and “Do Not Disturb” and available through the company’s official YouTube channel, the latest commercials highlight Siri’s HomeKit and language support, arriving hot on the heels off three Siri videos with The Rock from a few days ago.
* These reminder ads re-use most of the scenes from a much longer mini-film in which The Rock shows off various interactions with Siri to “dominate the day,” like taking a selfie from space.
* Watch the new ads embedded below.
* “It might be leg day, but Siri and HomeKit are doing all the heavy lifting here.”
* “Yes, The Rock speaks Mandarin. Is he just showing off? A little. Would it be showing off if we said Siri can understand over 20 languages? Definitely. But we did it anyway.”
* Apple is right.
* Despite the various Siri issues, Apple’s personal assistant leads the pack in terms of international support, with support for more languages than Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Microsoft’s Cortana assistant.
