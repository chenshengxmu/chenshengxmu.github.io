* Looking for yet another alternative to the stock App Switcher? I know, there’s no shortage of alternate app switchers, but there’s always room for one more, right?
* Well, on second thought, maybe not. Simplexity is a recently released jailbreak tweak on Cydia that wholeheartedly lives up to its name. While it’s simple in some aspects, it can make what should otherwise be a no-brainer function overly complex…
* Simplexity uses SwitcherLoader plugins along with a settings panel full of customization options to carve out its spot among App Switcher alternatives.
* There’s tons of customization, from table UI elements, to backgrounds, to text colors, it’s all here.
* In fact, the customization options are almost too much for the average person.
* It’s not that it’s hard to setup or use, it’s just that it makes what is normally a simple affair (app switching) complex and well, dull. Couple that with a $2.99 price point, and it’s evident that the tweak isn’t for me.
* What about you?
