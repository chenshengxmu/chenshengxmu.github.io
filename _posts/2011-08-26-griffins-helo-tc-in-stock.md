* Those of you paying attention will remember how just last week we told you about the Griffin Helo TC, a wonderful little helicopter that’s controlled by the power of your mind! Well, it actually needs an iPhone between your mind and the Helo TC, but still, that’s cool right?
* Last week the helicopter was out of stock, but now it’s back in stock, and available for purchase at just $49.99. Bargaintastic…
* The one downside to Griffin’s ‘copter? It’s IR-based, which means that it needs line-of-sight with the iPhone controller. The A.R. Drone works using WiFi, which obviously doesn’t have such a problem. The A.R. Drone is considerably more expensive, though, so for 50 Bucks, you really can’t go wrong.
* Perhaps just as impressive as the Helo TC is Griffin’s promotional video, which both entertains and indeed, informs.
* So, who’s ordering?
