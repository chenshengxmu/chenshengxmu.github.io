* Following Twitterrific’s recent 5.1 update for macOS which brought easier management of muffles/mutes, developer The Iconfactory has now refreshed Twitterrific for iPhone and iPad on App Store with expanded muffling options and other new features and enhancements.
* iPhone and iPad users can now muffle or mute tweets by Twitter client, as well as unlock three new icons for the iOS app assuming they use Twitterrific for Mac. To use one of the new icons, begin by tapping the hamburger icon in the app to reveal various in-app options.
* Access text options by tapping the middle icon at the bottom, launch Twitterrific on your Mac and tap one of the new icons in the iOS app to use as the new app icon going forward.

* Other changes in this release include improved scrolling performance and enhanced support for iOS 11’s Dark Mode-like Smart Invert (the colors are no longer inverted in the media viewer and on profile pages). Twitterrific and Twitter’s own iOS client both support Smart Invert.
* The Iconfactory claims that the iOS app’s image cache now uses less memory than before.
* Lastly, they’ve also squashed a few bugs, among them one that prevented Twitterrific’s Watch app from maintaining stable connection.
* Twitterrific for iPhone and iPad is a free download from App Store.
