* Just minutes following the WWDC keynote, in which Apple announced iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, the company has added official pages for the new software versions to its website. The iOS 8 page provides a rundown of all the new features that will be available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, ranging from QuickType and Family Sharing to Continuity and Health… 
* In similar fashion, the page for OS X Yosemite runs through the all-new features made to the Mac operating system. These features include a completely redesigned user interface, improvements to Safari and Notification Center, and a new programming language called Swift. We’ve covered all of these announcements within the blog, with more to come soon.
* iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite are available today as betas for developers. They will be released to the public in the Fall.
