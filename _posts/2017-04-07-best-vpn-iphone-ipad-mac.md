* Amid all the recent conversation about ISPs retaining the legal right to sell your internet usage data, many are contemplating their VPN options so they can mask their internet activity for increased privacy and security.
* In this piece, we’ll talk about some of the best VPNs for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
* For those of you that are still wondering what the benefits of using a VPN are, we suggest you start reading our post about why and how to use a VPN.
* Because we previously shared what we think about the safety and security of free VPNs (or lack, thereof), we will spend most of our time talking about more reliable and safer paid VPNs. Nevertheless, we will include a few free VPN options in this piece for those who are on tighter budgets and don’t have any other options. After all, something is still better than nothing.
* Paid VPNs are typically the best options for heightened privacy and security. Because users pay for the service, paid VPN services typically have the resources to maintain bandwidth speeds, protect your data with top-of-the-line encryption, and invest in ways to keep your data from being traced back to you.
* Among some of our favorite VPN services are the following:
* 1. Private Internet Access

* I’ve talked about Private Internet Access so many times that I feel like a broken record by now, but it’s honestly perhaps one of my favorite VPNs of all time as I indicated in my personal review last year.
* Not only does it work across all of your devices, but it’s both affordable and secure. Complete with end-to-end encryption, no user logging, plenty of servers to pick from, and fast bandwidth speeds, you’ll hardly even know it’s there; on the other hand, anyone who tries to snoop on you will certainly have one dog of a time trying.
* Private Internet Access is available in different subscription tiers, depending on whether you plan on being a long or short-term user. Obviously, those who subscribe to the service the longest get the best bulk pricing.
* While there isn’t a lifetime payment option and Private Internet Access is a subscription service, the payment plans are affordable, ranging from $2.91 to 6.95 per month.
* 2. NordVPN

* No one I’ve ever talked to has ever had anything bad to say about NordVPN. This service offers a lot of the same features as Private Internet Access, including support for multiple devices, no user logging, and excellent bandwidth speeds.
* With the bevy of server options you have to pick from, you can easily spoof your location to get around internet restrictions that are typically imposed by your school or organization.
* One of the most useful features of NordVPN is the automatic kill-switch, which ensures your privacy by disabling web communications with specified websites and apps whenever a secure connection cannot be established. This prevents your data from going through an unsecured tunnel, no matter what.
* NordVPN is available at slightly steeper prices than the competition so far, but its reputation makes it a worthy investment. With payment options ranging between $2.75-11.95 per month, it won’t break the bank, but you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck. This is definitely one of the best VPNs for iPhone, Mac, and iPad users.
* Limited-time offer: You can get three years of NordVPN service when you pay upfront. Total price for three years is $99, which comes down to $2.75/month. Get this special deal.
* 3. VPN Unlimited

* VPN Unlimited is another great paid VPN option because it offers many of the same high-quality services you would expect from a VPN, but with the added bonus of a one-time-payment lifetime subscription option.
* With end-to-end encryption, high-speed connections, and anonymous usage without logging, VPN Unlimited serves to keep your information from being snooped on by hackers.
* VPN Unlimited allows you to use multiple devices and gives you up to 7 days to cancel the service for a full refund if you’re not completely satisfied.
* If you want to go about the usual monthly payment subscription method, then prices range from $4.17-$9.99 per month. On the other hand, if you want unlimited access for life, then you can get it for just $149.99 up front.
* 4. TunnelBear

* TunnelBear is yet another viable option if you want security, but you also care about aesthetics. This is an app where the developers spent a lot of time on making it “look nice” in addition to providing good services.
* Both elegant and easy to use, TunnelBear provides the encryption you want and doesn’t log users’ information. A data kill-switch prevents any of your data from being sent over an insecure connection and the app can be configured to automatically launch at start-up so you’re protected from the moment you turn your machine on.
* With blazing-fast speeds and servers all around the world, TunnelBear is perfect for day-to-day security or for getting around internet blocks that are common at schools and/or organizations.
* TunnelBear has both free and paid options available to users, but the free options are capped to 500MB of usage per month and paid options are unlimited. The paid options range from $4.99-9.99 per month.
* 5. ExpressVPN

* When encryption is important to you, ExpressVPN is an excellent contender in the list of some of the world’s best VPN services.
* Not only do you get end-to-end encryption, but you get blazing-fast speeds as well as worldwide server selections to choose from. Like with most VPN services, it supports multiple devices and won’t log your personal browsing information, which is great for your privacy.
* ExpressVPN includes a 30-day money-back guarantee if you’re not satisfied, which is one of the longest trial periods in the industry.
* Depending on how long you want to pay to use the service, ExpressVPN offers a variety of pricing tier options with different term lengths, ranging from $8.32-12.95 per month.
* 6. IPVanish VPN

* IPVanish VPN is another notable name in the VPN industry that has earned high ratings over the years.
* With a staggering 750 worldwide VPN servers to pick from, you get more options than a lot of the competition have to offer. Moreover, you get high-speed access with end-to-end encryption and absolutely no data logging.
* You can use multiple devices to connect to IPVanish, and because your server choices are all around the world, you can easily spoof your location on each and every one of them to bypass unwanted internet filters.
* IPVanish offers different pricing tiers depending on how long you intend to be a customer; plans range from $6.49-10.00 per month, and you even get a 7-day money back guarantee if you’re not completely satisfied with what you’re paying for.
* 7. Hotspot Shield

* Hotspot Shield offers both paid and free options, and while I’ve used Hotspot Shield extensively many years ago, they’ve come a long way since then.
* Hotspot Shield offers not only a secure encrypted connection from servers all around the world that can get you around unwanted internet blocks, but it also provides built-in malware protection that prevents you from accessing known harmful websites.
* The free version of the VPN does assign a unique identifier to its users, but you still get the added benefit of browsing anonymously because your web browsing data is never tied to you. It’s great for everyday web surfing, especially if you’re using public Wi-Fi networks like those in McDonald’s or Starbucks often.
* There are a range of pricing options available depending on how long you intend to use the service. While the free option is ad-supported and offers fewer features, the paid version of Hotspot Shield ranges from $5.99-10.99 per month. You also have the option to buy a lifetime subscription for $109.99.
* 8. F-Secure Freedome VPN

* Before wrapping up, another option you might’ve heard of before is F-Secure Freedome VPN.
* It comes standard with complete privacy, which means your internet data is never logged, and it also includes end-to-end encryption with protection from hackers and Wi-Fi snoopers who want to know what you’re doing online.
* It’s worth noting that this VPN works on all of your deices and offers numerous servers from all around the world so that you can access pages where they’re normally blocked and more.
* With numerous pricing options available, you can find the right plan for you. Each plan lasts one year, but they support different numbers of devices ranging from 3-7, which is great for those of you who use more than one device and don’t want to over-pay. The prices of said plans range from $4.17-6.67 per month.
* Not all VPNs are equal and some have more features than others. On the other hand, most paid VPNs offer end-to-end encryption and don’t log your data, which will meet the needs of the average user. Generally, picking the best VPN comes down to what you’re willing to pay and what brand name you trust the most.
