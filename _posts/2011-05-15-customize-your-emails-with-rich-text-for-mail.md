* Another day, another reason to jailbreak your iPhone and customize it to the fullest. The latest jailbreak tweak is called Rich Text for Mail by well-known iOS developer Ryan Petrich (@rpetrich).
* Rich Text for Mail enables you to compose and reply to emails using custom fonts, colors and styles. That includes adding format, bold, italic, strikethrough, underline and image items to Action Menu. The app works in conjunction with Action Menu, so there are no additional buttons or apps added. Best of all, it adds all these customization tools to the stock iPhone Mail app…
* You can change settings for Rich Text for Mail from the Settings app on your iDevice. Rich Text for Mail is available for $4.99 from the Cydia Store.
* Check out a demo of the tweak in action below!
