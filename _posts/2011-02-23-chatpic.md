title: Pretty Up Your iPhone SMS App with ChatPic

* Here is an app that shouldn’t even exist in the first place as Apple should have implemented it in iOS. ChatPic is a new jailbreak app that will show address book photos next to text messages in the SMS app.
* For ChatPic to work, you obviously need to add a photo to your contacts, then whenever they text you, you will see their face next to the chat bubble…
* ChatPic only works with the stock SMS app. It will not work with apps such as BiteSMS (one of iDB’s favorite jailbreak apps) or iRealSMS. But really, if you have BiteSMS, you don’t really need this as you already have your contact’s picture showing up whenever you receive a new text message from him/her.
* You can get ChatPic from Cydia for $0.99. I haven’t given it a try but if you do, please let us know what you think by leaving a comment below.
