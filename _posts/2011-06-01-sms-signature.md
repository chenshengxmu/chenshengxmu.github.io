* SMS Signature is a new application available for jailbroken iPhones that will allow you to, as you probably figured out, add a custom signature to text messages sent from your iPhone.
* After downloading the application from Cydia, you can use the Settings app to configure SMS Signature. From there, you can create and activate a custom text signature. From now on, every time you send a text message, the signature will automatically be appended to it…
* I fail to see why would anyone add a signature to a text message. My mother in law does so and her signature says “Mom or Penny” so I guess there is a market for that.
* SMS Signature is free in Cydia. You will have to jailbreak your iPhone first before using the app.
* Would you have any use for this app?
