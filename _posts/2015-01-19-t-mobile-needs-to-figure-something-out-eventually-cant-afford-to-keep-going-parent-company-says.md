* While T-Mobile and its UnCarrier strategy are great for customers like you and me, apparently it’s not the best for business.
* Tim Hoetthes, CEO of T-Mobile US’ parent company Deutsche Telekom, said in an interview with Recode the company’s current path is unsustainable and something needs to change. 
* Currently $4 billion to $5 billion per year is being needed to keep T-Mobile afloat, due to the companies great, no-contract plans for customers. It’s exactly what the wireless industry needs, however it’s lead to five of the last six quarters the company has lost money.
* “The question is always the economics in the long term … and earning appropriate money,” Hoettges said. “You have to earn your money back at one point in time.”
* That’s why, Hoettges said, T-Mobile and Sprint would have been the perfect combination to be the ‘super-maverick’ in the US market. However, the US government didn’t think so and wouldn’t allow the third and fourth-largest carriers to merge.
* Deutsche Telekom is not bullish on the future of its T-Mobile division in the US unless it can merge with another company to have more of a financial backbone. Deutsche Telekom hasn’t always had the most support for the company, wanting to offload T-Mobile to focus on its German properties.
* “We have done what we had to do,”Hoettges explained to Recode. “We had built an infrastructure and this infrastructure had to get utilized and we did that with very aggressive promotions.”
* T-Mobile, with CEO John Legere leading the way, has been trying to reshape the wireless industry by ending two-year contracts, and adding plans to allow customers to upgrade phones when they’d like, unlimited data, messages, and voice, and free data roaming in worldwide.
* Its strategy has lead to great subscriber growth, just not the earnings numbers T-Mobile’s parent company wants to see.
