* AdaptiveColorPower is a new jailbreak tweak that utilizes the dominant color of your Lock screen’s wallpaper to tint the full-screen charging indicator you see whenever you plug your iPhone into a power source.
* The tweak basically removes the colored background that typically fills the battery icon in this display, but its new color scheme comes from whatever wallpaper you might have set for the Lock screen.
* On more complicated wallpapers, the green battery fill can tend to clash with other colors from the wallpaper, making it look awkward. This tweak is the answer to that problem, especially if you’re solid on keeping the wallpaper you already have.
* Some more examples of how the tweak’s effects look on various kinds of wallpapers below:

* As you can see, the battery percentage is still printed underneath the battery icon. The smaller colored battery indicator is also still displayed in the Status Bar, so you’re really not missing out on any visual information.
* If you go to Settings → AdaptiveColorPower after installing the tweak, you’ll find a preferences pane where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand. No respring is necessary to save your changes.

* AdaptiveColorPower works on all jailbroken iOS 9 iPhones. The developer says iPad support hasn’t been fully tested right now, so if you’re using an iPad, I’d recommend holding off.
* If you’re interested in trying the tweak, you can download it for free right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
