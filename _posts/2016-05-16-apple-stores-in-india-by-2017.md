* Apple hopes to open its first three retail stores in India by the end of 2017, reports FactorDaily. Citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, the outlet says the iPhone maker is currently eying “high street” locations in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai for massive 10,000+ square foot stores.
* In India, a team of 40 Apple executives has been working out of a Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon) office for the past few months to put the project together. Mostly expatriates, these employees work with the retail group of Apple and report directly to Apple’s headquarters in California.
* A second source close to Apple in India said the company is expected to make an announcement of the accelerator on Tuesday. Apple’s application for government permission for the Apple Store had been made last year and plans on that front were “a matter of routine”.
* Apple currently retails in India through large format electronic stores and exclusive stores it calls “Apple Premium Resellers.” Tim Cook said during a recent interview that Apple plans to expand its efforts in the country, seeing it as a major growth opportunity amidst dwindling iPhone sales.
* Cook is expected to visit India later this week.
