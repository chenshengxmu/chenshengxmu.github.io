title: Angry Birds Star Wars gameplay video debuts ahead of Thursday release
---
* I’m sure you know Angry Birds Star Wars is due on iOS, Android and a bunch of other platforms this coming Thursday. Rovio’s been promoting the hell out of this game and today the Finnish developer posted the official video that reveals much more in terms of gameplay than half a dozen previously released clips. Angry Birds Star Wars better be darn good. Otherwise, I’m gonna be hating everything Star Wars till the grave. I’ve also included a nice Darth Vader & Han Solo video after the break…
* And here’s the Obi Wan & Darth Vader clip.
* You may also wanna check out the previous, albeit much shorter, gameplay video and two teasers (here and here).
* For other videos featuring Han Solo, Chewie, R2-D2 and C-3PO, check out this article.
* If you still aren’t fed up with Angry Birds Star Wars, check out our announcement post for more details.
* I know who’s gonna be playing it like there’s no tomorrow – my mom.
* Ever since inheriting my iPad 2, she can’t get enough of Angry Birds and constantly keeps asking me about content updates.
* I don’t think there has ever been a mobile game franchise like this.
* I was – and still am – a big fan of the series but am nonetheless surprised that the game hasn’t run its course yet.
* You?
