* Apple is prototyping as many as ten next-generation iPhone models, and most analysts agree that the company will probably launch a trio of new handsets next year: an ‘iPhone 8’ with a wraparound OLED screen and all-new industrial design and LCD-based ‘iPhone 7s’ and ‘iPhone 7s Plus’ models. According to a new report Wednesday from the fairly reliable Japanese outlet Mac Otakara, LCD iPhones may come in a brand new Red color option.
* Based on information allegedly received from unnamed Taiwanese suppliers, both the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models should come in a new Red color option that’ll join the current Space Gray, Jet Black, Gold, Rose Gold and Silver colorways.
* Corroborating previous reports, the article states that the upcoming LCD-based handsets are expected to retain the iPhone 7’s industrial design and feature Apple’s next-generation A11 Fusion system-on-a-chip.
* Neither device will have wireless charging or glass chassis, said Mac Otakara.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks that the 4.7-inch iPhone model may feature glass chassis and wireless charging after all. Apple may even slash prices of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus to revitalize sales.
