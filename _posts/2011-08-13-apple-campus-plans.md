* What do you do if you have $75 billion dollars in the bank, and your company is growing so fast that you can’t find a big enough area to house your operations?
* That’s easy, you design and construct a seemingly stadium-sized building out of pure glass to send a message that your company is innovative and that money isn’t an object. And that’s exactly what Apple’s doing…
* Steve Jobs and company seemed really excited when they announced plans for the new Cupertino campus earlier this year. In fact, Jobs himself was spotted at a city council meeting to ensure that the building would receive approval.

* Although it’s not scheduled to open until 2015, the city of Cupertino just released a barrage of PDF’s containing blueprints and detailed drawings of Apple’s new spaceship-like workplace.
* The 4-story building is going to be completely made out of glass — curved glass at that. Jobs says there won’t be one piece of straight glass in the whole place. The structure will be able to hold 12,000 employees, and contain a cafeteria that will seat 3,000 of them.

* The plans also detail an underground parking lot with a solar panel-covered roof. On that note, Apple has stated that the entire building will be eco-friendly and the surrounding area will be filled with thousands of trees.

* I must say, if the economy is in a slump, you wouldn’t know it by looking at Apple’s new campus. You almost wonder if they’re overdoing it a little. But I guess when you’re the most valuable company in the world, it doesn’t matter.
* What do you think of Apple’s new campus?
