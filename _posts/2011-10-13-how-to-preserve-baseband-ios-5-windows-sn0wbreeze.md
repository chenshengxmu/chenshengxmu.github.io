* If you’re looking to preserve your iPhone’s baseband when upgrading to iOS 5 on a Windows machine, then Sn0wBreeze is your ticket to baseband freedom.
* Preserving your unlockable baseband is integral to being able to unlock your phone when an updated version of UltraSn0w is released tomorrow.
* Windows users, this one’s for you. Check inside for the full video tutorial that shows how to preserve your baseband, while upgrading to iOS 5 using Windows…
* If you’re on a Windows machine, your options are limited to Sn0wBreeze at this time, because RedSn0w has not been updated with baseband preservation capabilities on Windows as of this writing. Mac users can use RedSn0w 0.9.9b5 to preserve their baseband.
* Step 1: Download Sn0wBreeze 2.8 beta 8 from our Downloads Page.
* Step 2: Run Sn0wBreeze, click ‘OK’ and click ‘Close Credits’ and click the blue next button in the bottom right-hand corner.
* Step 3: Drag your iOS 5 firmware file to the gray box on Sn0wBreeze. Make sure you have the correct firmware file for your device.
* Step 4: Sn0wBreeze will identify the device and firmware, verify that they are correct.
* Step 5: Click the blue next button in the bottom right-hand corner, and select Baseband Preservation Mode. You will receive a reminder about jailbreaking. Click next.
* Step 6: Now Sn0wBreeze will start building your firmware. It will give you the option to play PacMan, or stick to the spinner. I recommend sticking to the spinner. PacMan requires flash, ’nuff said 😉
* Step 7: Once completed, Sn0wBreeze will place the custom created firmware on your desktop. It should be prefixed with “Sn0wBreeze”. Verify, and click ‘OK’.
* Step 8: Put your iPhone into DFU mode by holding ‘home + power’ for 10 seconds, then releasing ‘power’ while continuing to hold ‘home’ for 10 seconds.
* Step 9: Click ‘Start’ on the DFU Pwner screen in Sn0wBreeze.
* Step 10: Sn0wBreeze will run ‘iReb’ and place your iPhone into Pwned DFU Mode. You will get a confirmation screen that the phone is indeed in Pwned DUF state. Click ok, and close out of Sn0wBreeze completely.
* Step 11: Open iTunes, it should recognize that your device is in recovery mode, click ‘OK’.
* Step 12: Hold ‘Shift’ on your keyboard, and click ‘Restore’ on iTunes. Select the newly created Sn0wBreeze custom firmware.
* Step 13: Your iPhone should restore completely, with your unlockable baseband in tact!
* Note: This does not jailbreak your device, or unlock your device. When the new version of UltraSn0w for iOS 5 is released, you can jailbreak, and install UltraSn0w from Cydia to unlock your device if you wish. For more info on Sn0wBreeze, refer to our dedicated Sn0wBreeze page.
