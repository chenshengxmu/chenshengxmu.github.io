* Adam Bell’s much-loved Stride jailbreak tweak has finally received some love for iOS 7, and it comes in the form of Stride 2, a brand new upcoming incarnation of Stride that works on Apple’s latest version of iOS.
* Stride 2 lets users unlock their devices by drawing a password on screen using a finger. It’s an elegant and individualistic method for unlocking a device. Have a look at our full video review of Stride 2 inside.
* Once you install Stride 2, you’ll need to head to the stock Settings app and find its preferences. Inside of Stride 2’s preferences, you’ll find a kill-switch to enable or disable the tweak, and an option to record your password.
* Tapping the record password button brings you to an interface dedicated to establishing a new password. You’ll find a canvas to practice your password drawing strokes, a Change Password button for when you’re ready to create your password, and an Options button for setting password recognition strictness.

* Once you tap the record button, you’ll be asked to draw you password three successive times in order to capture your drawing. During each drawing process, you’re not allowed to lift your finger off of the screen until you’re finished. In other words, the password must be a contiguous drawing with no line breaks.
* After you’ve finished recording your password, tap the Save button in the upper right-hand corner to save it. You can then head to the Lock screen, and test our your drawing.

* Once on the Lock screen, swipe from left to right to access the password drawing canvas. From there, you can draw you password, or tap the cancel button to enter the device’s standard numerical passcode. A passcode must be enabled on your device before you can configure Stride 2 to work. I should also mention that Stride plays nice with the iPhone 5s’ Touch ID sensor.
* Stride 2 is a great way to customize the unlocking experience on your iPhone, and it looks beautiful in the process. It’s available for $2.99 right now on the BigBoss repo.
