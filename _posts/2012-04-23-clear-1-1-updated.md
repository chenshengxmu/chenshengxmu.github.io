* Realmac Software’s nice-looking to-do app dubbed Clear has been updated today with new features. It’s the first update since the software’s debut on the App Store in mid-February.
* In addition to the shake-to-undo feature which, in my opinion, makes for a good demo but gets boring fast, Clear 1.1 added additional inspiration quotes while tweaking the interface with new gestures and other nice-to-haves.
* The biggest new feature is support for ‘secret’ user interface themes. How secret? Well, you will need to unlock those to find out…
* The long-awaited update to the light-weight app – which helps keep track of your life by keeping a simple list of notes – comes with obligatory bug fixes, also bringing with it support for themes (these should appeal to folks who like to skin their software).
* You will also like unlimited text fields removing Clear’s annoying one-line limit in the task description field. Another handy tweak: a toggle to display the iOS status bar.
* By the way, did you notice that more and more third-party apps tend to hide the iOS status bar by default? Hope it doesn’t become a trend.
* Also new: improved tap-to-create-item behavior at the bottom of lists, subtle text emboss that improves readability and new design for alerts.
* The team is already at work “on some amazing things for Clear” to come in a future update. Check out release notes right below.
* Clear is a 99-cent download for your iPhone or iPod touch right from the App Store.
* Clear 1.1 release notes
* • Shake to Undo: a popular request, and now all yours. • Character Cap is now voluntary. With great power comes great responsibility… • Secret Themes! How secret? So tantalizingly secret we can’t say more. • New option display the iOS status bar. • Improved the tap-to-create-item behaviour at the bottom of lists. • 25% added inspiration (more quotes!) • Shiny new design for alerts • Fixed legibility in low-contrast situations with subtle text emboss • Added the Clear tutorial to the Tips and Tricks menu • Bug fixes
* Clear moved an impressive 350,000 downloads in the first nine days on the App Store. I purchased a copy as soon as it came out and have been impressed with how elegant, simple and effective its user interface is.
* I’m also giving it a big thumbs-up in the gestures department because Clear sports novel touch-based features that I’d love to see in other apps.
* Have you tried out Clear yet? If so, what did you think of it?
