* In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Apple CEO Tim Cook offered strong opinions on President Donald Trump’s approach to China. He also discussed DACA and Dreamers.
* Calling Trump’s trade policies with China “problematic,” the executive expressed concerns about a possible trade war between the United States and its largest trading partner. In the interview on “The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations,” Trump noted that previous trade policies were flawed, but Trump’s views were more concerning.
* Cook met with Trump at the White House in late April just as the president’s administration began instituting tariffs on a least a $50 billion worth of goods from China, which has led to retaliation.
* As Cook explained:
* It’s true, undoubtedly true, that not everyone has been advantaged from that — in either country — and we’ve got to work on that. But I felt that tariffs were not the right approach there, and I showed him some more analytical kinds of things to demonstrate why.
* During his Oval Office meeting, the CEO also discussed with the president the ongoing immigration battle over the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which spared so-called Dreamers from deportation.
* Though Trump signed an executive order ending DACA, courts have so far said DACA remains the law of the land. However, as Cook explained, “We’re only one ruling away from a catastrophic case there.”
* One area where Cook is more supportive of Trump is the 2017 budget law that slashed corporate taxes. Because of this, Cook has said Apple will bring $350 billion into the U.S. over the next five years through hiring, tax payments, and capital expenditures.
* As Cook explains:
* We’re also going to buy some of our stock because we view our stock as a good value. It’s good for the economy as well because if people sell stock they pay taxes on their gains.
* Other topic addressed in the Bloomberg interview included Apple’s ongoing stock buyback program, the steady rise of the  Apple Music subscription service, and more.
* Though Cook’s interview doesn’t offer new insight on how the Apple CEO thinks, it’s worth watching nonetheless. You can view the entire interview via the Bloomberg website.
