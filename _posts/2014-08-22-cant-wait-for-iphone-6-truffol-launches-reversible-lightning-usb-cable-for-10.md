* Online retailer Truffol has launched a reversible Lightning cable for models of the iPhone, iPad, and iPods that support the connection technology. This marks the first reversible Lightning cable, meaning there is no wrong way to plug it into the USB port on your charger or computer as there is on the official cable sold by Apple.
* Apple hasn’t officially launched or embraced a reversible Lightning cable as of yet, but is rumored to do so when it launches the iPhone 6 in the coming weeks. Truffol is allowing you get a leg up on the Cupertino-based company for a measly $9.99.
* We haven’t had the chance to test the cable offered by Truffol, but the online retailer claims it works seamlessly. It’s a standard 1.0m (3.3ft) cable, the same offered by Apple, but isn’t MFi certified. Truffol offers a one-year product warranty, along with a 30-day return.
* A study released by The Guardian earlier this month found a reversible USB cable could save you time in life. It found that users miss the USB point roughly 60 percent of the time. The Guardian multiplied the total number of seconds potentially saved across the year – aka 4.5 seconds per user for the 365 days of the year – a double sided Lightning cable could save iPhone owners 147,825,000,000 seconds a year. Of course, the study was pretty unscientific.

* Prolific Apple leaker Sonny Dickson was the first to show what is claimed to be a reversible USB port on the new Lightning cables. It’s unconfirmed, but a patent filed by Apple in 2013 mentioned “reversible or dual-orientation USB plug connectors” that will potentially “reduce the potential USB connector damage and user frustration”.
* Truffol seemingly has a head start on Apple, supporting 2.4A of high-current charging that is found on the iPad Air. For $10, this doesn’t seem like a shabby little gift to yourself for waiting until the next-generation iPhone is released. We definitely feel your pain on the wait time.
