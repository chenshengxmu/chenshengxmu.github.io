* Customers who’ve purchased a 64 or 128-gigabyte edition of either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus won’t need to download Apple’s iLife and iWork productivity suite when the handset hits store shelves this Friday as the apps will come pre-loaded on their device, according to an internal Apple Retail training document obtained by Dan DeSilva of 9to5Mac.
* Apple since last September started providing Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iTunes U apps as free downloads to every new iOS device owner.
* The image below represents a passage from Apple’s internal training material proving that the 64/128GB editions of the iPhone 6/Plus will come with the iLife/iWork suite of apps pre-loaded on the devices.

* DeSilva couldn’t tell whether GarageBand in-app purchases will be available at no additional cost. Hopefully, Apple will allow folks to remove the apps from their device.
* Customers opting for an entry-level editions of the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus with sixteen gigabytes of storage will have to download these apps manually from the App Store.

* iPhoto for iOS won’t be provided as Apple back in June announced plans to stop development of Aperture for Mac and iPhoto for Mac and iOS and focus on the stock iOS 8 Photos app with iCloud Photo Library support.
* The Mac edition of Photos is due in 2015.
* GarageBand is among the apps featured in Apple’s iPhone 6 promo video.

* iOS 8 on the iPhone 6 features a special landscape mode for stock apps like Messages and Mail that features an iPad-like two-pane interface that boosts productivity.
* It remains to be seen whether the Cupertino firm will update the iLife/iWork apps to take advantage of this feature. The iBooks app, now an optional download, is now a stock app in iOS 8.
* Is this a smart move on Apple’s part?
* Would you mind having these apps preloaded on your iPhone 6?
