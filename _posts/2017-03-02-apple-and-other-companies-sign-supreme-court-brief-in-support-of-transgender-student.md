* After decrying U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw anti-discrimination protections for transgender bathroom use in schools, Apple and 52 other firms like Amazon, Apple, IBM and Microsoft have signed a Supreme Court brief in support of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who’s fighting against his school district over which school bathrooms he may use.
* The New York Times reported that the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit organization supporting gay rights, plans to file the signed brief on Thursday.
* Grimm took Virginia’s Gloucester County School Board to court over restrictions on which bathrooms transgender students may use. The Human Rights Campaign is urging the Supreme Court to side with him.
* “These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America’s leading businesses have their backs,” Chad Griffin, the Human Rights Campaign’s president, said in a statement announcing the support.
* Other signatories of the brief include technology giants Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, IBM, Intel, LinkedIn, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, Twitter, Yahoo and Yelp, including businesses from other industries such as Gap, MAC Cosmetics, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Warby Parker and Williams-Sonoma.
* Grimm is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union in his case.
