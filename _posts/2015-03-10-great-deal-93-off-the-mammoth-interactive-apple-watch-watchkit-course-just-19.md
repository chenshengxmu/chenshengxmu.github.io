* With yesterday’s in depth announcement of the Apple Watch and the April 10th pre-order date just a month away, it’s time to start thinking about building the first killer Apple Watch app. With the new form factor and features, we can’t wait to see what people will come up with… and by “people,” we mean you!
* For just $19 (97% off normal $299 price) you can learn how to create beautiful and useful apps with the Apple Watch Watchkit Course from iDownloadBlog Deals. The course, from leading online learning provider Mammoth Interactive, will teach you the fundamentals about Apple Watch development and walk you through the creation of six sample apps.
