* Apple has started to showcase a number of apps that offer free trials before starting a subscription. You can find it for yourself by visiting the App Store, then tapping on the Apps tab, and looking under the “Try It For Free” section.
* There you can see featured apps including 1Password, USA Today, and more.
* You can tap on any of these apps to see the available subscriptions, with big font clearly saying “FREE TRIAL”.
* Of course, these apps haven’t just recently taken it upon themselves to offer the free trials. Apple is just now choosing to highlight them as a feature for prospective users to try before they buy.

* iOS 11 saw a major redesign of the App Store with a focus on more curated content including a new “Today” tab with regular stories and features relevant to apps and the App Store.
