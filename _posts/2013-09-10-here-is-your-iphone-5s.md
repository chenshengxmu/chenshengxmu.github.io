* Well the big moment has finally arrived. After months of rumors, reports and speculation, Apple has just taken the wraps off of its new flagship smartphone: the iPhone 5s.
* It’s a familiar-looking handset with a bevy of upgrades—including a new 64-bit A7 processor, and a handful of new features. And yes, it looks like there’s a new gold colorway…

* For the most part, it looks like all of the rumors have been spot on. There’s 2 new colors: gold and ‘Space Grey,’ and there’s a pill-shaped LED flash on the backside of the handset.
* On the inside, the phone is running a brand new system-on-a-chip called the A7—it’s the first 64-bit processor used in a smartphone. And it’s really fast—over twice as fast as A6.
* It also appears that there’s a new component called the M7. It’s a “motion co-processor,” and it works alongside the A7 measuring things like the accelerometer, compass, and gyroscope.
* Battery life doesn’t appear to be much of an improvement over previous models. Apple is quoting 10 hours of 3G talk time, 10 Hours of LTE browsing.

* The 5s also has an all-new camera, which sports a new five-element Apple-designed lens, an F2.2 aperture and a 15% larger active sensor area. The pixels are larger too:—1.5 microns. The camera is capable of burst-mode, recording video in 720p, and in slow-motion at 120 fps (frames per second).

* And finally, Apple saved the best for last: Touch ID. All of the rumors were true, the iPhone 5s has a fingerprint sensor built into its Home button to be used for fast and secure authentication.
* The sensor itself is 170 microns thin and is based on capacitive touch technology with a resolution of 500 ppi. This means that users shouldn’t have any problem getting a clean and quick scan.
* All of this will be available in 9 countries on September 20, and in over 100 countries by September. And the 16GB model will start at $199 with a carrier contract.
