* Now that the T-Mobile-Sprint merger is off, it looks like the race is on for the definitive third place spot in the ranks of US carriers. Sprint fired the first shot with its new ‘Family Share Pack’ plan, and today, T-Mobile responded.
* The magenta carrier announced today a new promotion that will benefit both current and new customers. Starting next week, the company will start giving away one free year of unlimited LTE data for referrals and switchers…
* Here’s more from the press release:
* Sprint’s customers have suffered much. They’ve endured the Framily. They’ve endured America’s slowest nationwide LTE network. And now again, the (ironically named) carrier has forsaken its loyal customers, offering its latest, “best deals” to everyone but its own current customers. It’s hard to watch.
* But now T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) is stepping forward to help. Today, the Un-carrier announced a new program encouraging T-Mobile customers to save their friends and colleagues still with Sprint.
* Starting next week, whenever a T-Mobile Simple Choice customer throws a lifeline to a Sprint (or AT&T or Verizon) customer and brings them to the Un-carrier, both receive unlimited LTE data for a full year on T-Mobile’s blazing-fast LTE network, at no additional charge. T-Mobile Simple Choice customers who already have unlimited LTE data receive a $10 credit each month for twelve months.
* “It continues to amaze me to see the old carriers failing to listen to their customers−or reward them for their loyalty,” said T-Mobile’s brazen CEO John Legere. “That arrogance has defined the U.S. wireless industry for too long.”
* The new promo kicks off August 29th. To qualify for it, T-Mobile customers just need to report their referrals here. Once approved, unlimited LTE data service (or $10 per month credit) will begin for both parties within 30 days.
