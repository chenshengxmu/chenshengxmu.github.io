* I don’t believe there’s one feature on the iPhone that angers me as much as auto correct. It’s always misinterpreting what I’m trying to type, usually with ridiculous results.
* Auto correct on the iPhone will turn a phrase like “Let’s go have lunch” into “Keep on step eagle.” I know, that makes no sense whatsoever, and that’s my point.
* Fortunately for us, the jailbreak community has had enough of this utter nonsense as well, as evident by the release of ManualCorrect…
* ManualCorrect is essentially the reverse of auto correct. If you misspell a word while typing with ManualCorrect installed, instead of automatically correcting the word, it will offer a suggestion.
* It will not auto correct the word for you, but it will highlight a misspelling so that you can identify any mistakes you made, and manually correct them later, hence the name.

* Now you might be wondering, why not just disable auto correct and be done with it? The reason is, if you disable auto correct outright, you won’t receive suggestions mid-typing, and you won’t receive suggestions after the fact.
* Turning off auto correct is a lose-lose proposition unless you possess impeccable grace with the iPhone’s keyboard.

* ManualCorrect is a jailbreak tweak that has definitely found a permanent home on my iPhone, and I’d consider purchasing it, if it weren’t already free on Cydia for jailbroken iPhones.
* What do you think about this tweak?
