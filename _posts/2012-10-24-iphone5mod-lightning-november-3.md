* iPhone5Mod previously released an interesting iPhone 5 Flash Lightning Dock, its first unauthorized Lightning-equipped accessory, and recently announced a nice backplate replacement for your iPhone 5. Today, they’re launching three new Lightning accessories set to ship November 3. Of course, these unsanctioned cables and adapters lure with low prices that significantly undercut Apple’s comparable offerings (think a 50 percent discount or more). We’ve got more information and nice promo clips right past the fold…
* MacRumors points us to iPhone5mod’s new Lightning to USB cable, its version of Apple’s cabled Lightning to 30-pin Adapter and an interesting Lightning 3-in-1 Starter Kit Set.
* The USB cable will run you $9.90 versus Apple’s asking price of $19. iPhone5mod’s version of Apple’s cabled Lightning to 30-pin Adapter is a $19.90 value versus Apple’s $39 price tag.

* Their Lightning 3-in-1 Starter Kit Set, seen below, is pretty noteworthy: the bundle includes iPhone5mod’s USB cable, a 30-pin adapter and a Lightning dock – all for $39.90 (plus seven bucks in shipping costs to the United States), representing a ten-buck saving over their combined quoted prices.

* iPhone5mod confirms that orders will begin shipping on November 3. Add on top of the above prices $4 per item in shipping costs within the U.S (more for international shipments).
* Here’s a nice promo clip.
* iPhone5mod claims its products fully support iTunes, data sync and battery charging and says it uses parts “of same quality as Apple suppliers”. Some 30-pin accessories are not supported and neither is the video out feature.
* These accessories should work with any Lightning-equipped device: currently, it’s the iPhone 5, fifth-gen iPod touch, seventh-gen iPod nano, fourth-gen iPad with Retina display and the all-new iPad mini.
* Of course, not everyone was sold on the ‘low price’ meme.
* iDannyOcean noted on Twitter that shipping costs make iPhone5mod’s offering less attractive than at first blush.
* So iPhone5mod offers lightning cables 50% off Apple price but charges $4 per item shipping.I’d rather pay extra $6 to appl 2get 1yr warranty

* It wasn’t immediately clear at press time whether those accessories use cracked Lightning chips. That certainly appears to be the case because Apple isn’t set to lay out rules of the game for “Made for iPhone” makers until next month and is currently the only game in town when it comes to authorized Lightning gear.
* The ball is now in Apple’s court.
* Following the iPad mini keynote yesterday, the online Apple Store added two new Lightning accessories: a VGA and HDMI video out cables, each costing a rather nerve-wracking $49.
* These new items expand Apple’s offering of pricey Lightning accessories, which also includes a $19 Lightning to USB cable and the Lightning to 30-pin Adapter, available in a $29 direct-plug and $39 cable version.
