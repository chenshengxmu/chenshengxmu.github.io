* Although we’ve heard conflicting rumors over the last few months regarding Apple’s next tablet, a majority of them seem to agree on one thing: appearance. The consensus is that the iPad 3 will look extremely similar to its predecessor, albeit a bit thicker.
* Case manufacturers even seem to be fairly confident in the gossip, as they’re already starting to churn out iPad 3 covers that fall in line with the chatter. But if the rumor mill has taught us anything in the past, it’s that the case manufacturers don’t always get it right…
* You may recall the onslaught of iPhone 5 rumors leading up to Apple’s Fall iPhone announcement last year. The gossip called for a slimmer iPhone with a larger screen and a tapered profile, and the case-makers went for it. We must have seen hundreds of purported iPhone 5 cases. But, as we all know, that device never materialized.

* So you can imagine our level of skepticism when we saw these new “iPad 2S” cases pop up online yesterday. They come from a Chinese case producer known as Chinne, and fit a device that is reportedly 1MM thicker than the iPad 2. Interesting.
* It’s worth noting that case-makers have been right in the past. Just last year, 9to5Mac got its hands on an iPad 2 case more than a month before Apple unveiled the tablet. And it turned out to be fairly accurate.
* Apple’s next iPad is expected to be an upgrade in every sense of the word, featuring a higher resolution display, a faster processor, and higher megapixel cameras. The company is expected to unveil the tablet sometime between late February and early March.
