* M, would approve. SpyPhoto is a recently released jailbreak tweak that allows you to take Photos without detection.
* Utilizing the ubiquitous Activator to do its dirty work, SpyPhoto enables users to snap pics void of shutter sounds, flashes, or heads up display. You can literally take photos from any app, anywhere.
* Check inside for a video demonstration of this covert jailbreak tweak in action…
* Obviously, it’s highly recomended that if you do choose to use this tweak, you use it for good, and not for evil.
* SpyPhoto is available for $1.50 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. That may seem like a lot, but I’ve heard the spy business pays well.
