* Colendar is a brand new jailbreak tweak from developer Julian Weiss that allows you to change up the color of the text present on the stock Calendar app. The tweak, which is geared towards themers, also works with Ryan Petrich’s Gregorian calendar app.
* Included in Colendar’s preferences are options to adjust the color of the day and date text and offset parameters for adjusting the location of the text assets as well. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside for more insight…
* Inside the tweak’s preferences you’ll find two sections for weekday color and date color. Each section contains the same list of colors, and there’s a decent variety from which to choose from.
* Unfortunately, selecting a new color for either section requires a respring, so it’s not going to be something that allows you to perform a quick “guess and check” to see if the color combinations are pleasing to the eye. I also found that, at least on my iPhone 5s, disabling the tweak had no bearing on whether or not the custom colors were displayed. I ended up having to completely uninstalling Colendar to make the changes go away.

* The last section you’ll find within Colendar’s preferences is geared towards adjusting text offsets. This section, appropriately labeled adjustments, lets Colendar work well with custom themes that require such intricate refinements.
* Overall, Colendar is a solid tweak, if not a bit pricey for what it does. That being said, I’m not sure how much work had to got into making such a tweak successful. Perhaps Julian put a lot of effort into its development, and as such, it would be appropriate to charge what he’s decided to charge.
* If you want to take Colendar for a spin, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download the tweak for $1.99. Please be sure to let me know what you think about it down below in the comments.
