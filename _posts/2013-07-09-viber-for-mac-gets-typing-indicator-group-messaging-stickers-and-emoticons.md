* The popular Skype alternative and WhatsApp rival Viber today updated its Mac app with half a dozen new features. You’ll recall that Viber released the inaugural Mac build back in May to allow for cross-platform messaging. I’ve been actively using it ever since on my MacBook Air and today’s update adds a few features I’ve been missing a lot.
* Now, when you’re chatting with someone, you can tell whether a person is typing a message thanks to the new typing indicator. And for a feature-parity with Viber for iOS, the Mac edition now expands on the initial release with full support for group messaging capabilities, as well as popular stickers and emoticons. I’ve included a few remaining nice-to-haves after the break…
* Viber for Mac version 3.1 has a redesigned conversations list and improved pop-up notifications.
* Here, check out emoticons.

* And here are stickers.

* And if you use Viber with more than one number, you’ll be delighted to learn that the app has full support for contacts with multiple Viber numbers.
* Here’s a quick video tour for the initial Mac release from May.
* The Mac app lets you carry on your conversations on any number of supported device and it’s clever enough not to sound alarm on each one of them when a new message notification arrives.
* Viber is available for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Windows Phone and other platforms.
* The Mac build isn’t available on the Mac App Store and doesn’t have the auto-update feature so you’ll have to download the latest build and drop its icon on the Applications folder to replace your outdated version.
