* The App Store and Mac App Store are home to plenty of apps for novice and pro DJs alike. Algoriddim’s djay 2 (read our review) and Native Instruments’ Traktor DJ are among the finest examples of how a tablet can be used to double as a virtual turntable for mixing tracks in real-time.
* I’ve seen a number of DJs hook up their iPad to pro equipment and mix tracks from their iTunes library as if it were second nature. To be perfectly clear, I suck at DJing and have no interest in it.
* Those who dig DJing, however, are advised to take a look at the just-updated djay 2 for the iPhone and iPad or take advantage of a time-limited discount on Traktor DJ for the iPhone and iPad. I also mention another notable discount on a similar app, Cross DJ for Mac. Jump past the break for the full reveal…
* Djay 2 for iPhone and iPad has been updated with the following improvements:
* Djay 2 for iPad also adds a firmware upgrade for iDJ Pro which fixes channel swap issue and improves compatibility with iOS 7.
* Here’s a video overview of some of the djay 2 features, as of last summer.
* Djay 2 for iPhone and iPod touch costs $1.99 in the App Store.
* The iPad edition is a standalone $9.99 download.
* Both djay 2 editions require iOS 6 or later.
* The Mac App Store edition of djay 2 is $19.99.

* Traktor DJ (pictured above), is another premium app for DJs.
* Released a year ago by German developer Native Instruments, it’s now available discounted in a time-limited sale. The iPhone/iPod touch edition is temporarily available with a cool 80+ percent discount and the iPad version is down almost 50 percent.
* Traktor DJ for iPhone is now $0.99 in the App Store, down from $4.99.
* The iPad edition has gone half price, from $19.99 down to just $9.99.
* Both Traktor DJ editions require iOS 5.1 or later.
* While we’re at it, don’t miss out on another noteworthy deal as Mixvibes’ Cross DJ for Mac gas been discounted, too, for a limited time.
* Pick up Cross DJ in the Mac App Store for $29.99, down from $49.99.
* The app lets you mix both audio and video, with full video output available as a $19.99 in-app purchase.
* Lsat but not least, those eyeing something completely different should take a look at Pacemaker, the first DJ app with Spotify integration and a very interesting user interface.

* Released earlier in February, this app lets you pick any song from Spotify’s catalog of 20 millions tracks and mix along.
* You can even stream and mix two Spotify tracks simultaneously.
* The best part: Pacemaker is free in the App Store.
* You’ll need an iPad running iOS 7.0 or later.
