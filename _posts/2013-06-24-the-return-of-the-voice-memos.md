* A few moments ago, Apple released the second beta of its next-generation mobile operating system, iOS 7, to developers. The first beta, which was released two weeks ago today, featured a number of UI changes and new features. And today’s update adds to that.
* One of the bigger changes we’ve noticed in beta 2 is that Apple has re-added the stock Voice Memos app. The utility was missing from the original iOS 7 release, leaving some folks to speculate that Apple was getting rid of it all together. But that’s not the case…
* As you can see in the screenshot above, the app has received the full iOS 7 treatment, complete with a flatter UI design (gone are the microphone and volume needle graphics) and text-based navigation. There is also now a large graphic that shows noise wavelength.
* Functionality-wise, however, not much has changed. You can still record notes at your convenience, by tapping the red Record button, and playback your recordings in-app. This time, however, you can view your list of recordings by tapping toward the bottom of the app.
* Stay tuned to iDB today, as we continue to highlight all of the changes found in iOS 7 beta 2.
