We’ll let you know if we find any outward-facing improvements in this beta.

* The fifth beta follows macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 4 which was was released on February 27, after beta 3 on February 20, beta 2 on February 7 and the original developer-only beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.4 on January 24.

* When it releases publicly, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 will bring Night Shift Mode to your Mac. The feature was originally designed to help iOS users adjust the temperature of their display from cool to warm, manually or based on the time of day.

* You can access Night Shift for Mac in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri. A dedicated preference pane lets you adjust when your Mac’s display will begin gradually shifting from blue to yellow to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is said to cause sleeping problems.
