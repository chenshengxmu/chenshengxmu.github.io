* It’s official: the iPad mini, iPad 4 and iPhone 5 are set to land on China’s store shelves in December. The company announced today the 7.9-inch iPad mini and 9.7-inch iPad 4 with Retina display will arrive Friday, December 7, while the iPhone 5 drops a bit later – December 14. Only Wi-Fi iPad models are being released now as the cellular option has just cleared China regulatory hoops.
* As of the Friday announcement, new iPads are available in 42 countries. The iPhone 5, which had some earlier supply glitches, has now rolled out in 47 countries…
* Apple’s media release reads:
* Apple today announced the Wi-Fi versions of iPad mini and fourth generation iPad with Retina display will be available in China on Friday, December 7, and iPhone 5 will be available on Friday, December 14.
* iPad mini and the new fourth generation iPad with Retina display are currently available in 42 countries, and iPhone 5 is available in 47 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK.
* Just yesterday, China reportedly granted the iPhone 5 a network access license, essentially approving the handset for China Telecom, the nation’s third-largest carrier.
* For some time rumors have swirled around an iPhone 5 licensing deal with China Mobile, the country’s largest provider. So far, such talk remains only in the rumor stage.
* China recently has been center-stage.
* Along with ongoing debate on if and when Apple will sign a deal with China’s largest carrier China Mobile, new reports indicate the country is hugely important for the iPhone maker.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said “demand is off the charts in China”.

* A new survey of worldwide iOS and Android markets found China’s smartphone growth on pace to pass the US as the largest market for smartphones.
* With 2013 seeming to be framed as China’s year, what changes must Apple make to adapt to the market?
* Although iPad sales top a hundred million units and most mobile ad impressions come from iOS devices, Android’s growth is not pausing.
* Can the $199 iPhone 5 meet the demand for low-cost smartphones in China – or will Apple need to try a new tactic?
