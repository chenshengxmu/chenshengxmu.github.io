* Thursday, software maker Microsoft announced immediate availability of Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps for the iPhone following the release of Office for iPad applications back in March 2014.
* Moreover, the company has refreshed the entire iOS Office suite with Dropbox integration and adding other new features to “ensure a consistently beautiful and productive Office experience on every device”.
* In addition to the new Office for iPhone and update iPad apps, Word, Excel and PowerPoint are coming to Android tablets with the start of Microsoft’s Office for Android tablet Preview program. Finally, brand new, touch-optimized Office apps for Windows 10 are in the works and “we’ll have more to share soon”.
* Universal Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps are free in the App Store.
* Basic editing features are now provided at no cost.
* “Starting today, people can create and edit Office content on iPhones, iPads, and soon, Android tablets using Office apps without an Office 365 subscription,” notes Microsoft.
* Office 365 subscribers (in-app subscriptions in Office for iPad start at eight bucks per month) gain additional features like advanced editing and collaboration capabilities, unlimited OneDrive storage, Dropbox integration and more.

* According to the Redmond-based Windows giant, since its March 2014 release customers have downloaded Office for their iPads more than forty million times.
* Just last week, the company pushed a redesigned version of Outlook for OS X and said that the next-generation Office for Mac beta is scheduled for the first half of 2015, with the final release slated for the second half of 2015.
