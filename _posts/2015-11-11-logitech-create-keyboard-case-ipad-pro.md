* Accessory maker Logitech wasted no time launching its Create Backlit Keyboard Case, a folio-style protector for the iPad Pro that offers a full-size keyboard with backlit keys, something Apple’s pricey $169 Smart Keyboard case is lambasted for lacking.
* Billed as the first third-party keyboard case for Apple’s latest tablet, the accessory connects to the iPad Pro’s new Smart Connector which offers simultaneous keyboard charging and data transfer, without the need for manual Bluetooth pairing.
* Developed closely with Apple, the Create Backlit Keyboard Case is focused on content production and boosting your productivity with full-size backlit keys that take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s expansive workspace and new iOS 9 features.

* Thin and lightweight, the case is made from tightly-woven premium fabric that Logitech says helps resist accidental bumps, scratches and spills.
* Resembling the black chiclet keys on Mac notebooks, it includes dedicated iOS shortcut keys and hardware controls for iOS 9’s keyboard shortcuts bar while providing different angles for typing and viewing modes.
* Custom-sculpted curves and precision-formed anodized aluminum provide structural integrity to protect your expensive iPad Pro on the inside.

* AppleInsider went hands-on with the case, writing that the keys “are on par with other third-party manufacturers in terms of travel and a fairly thick keyboard base makes the entire platform relatively sturdy for laptop typing.”
* The Create Backlit Keyboard Case is available starting today for $150 from the Logitech website in Black, Blue or Red. Is this a better value for money than Apple’s $169 keyboard case for the iPad Pro, do you think?
