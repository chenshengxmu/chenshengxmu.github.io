* Staples’ Black Friday circular has been released, showing what deals it will be offering during the infamous holiday shopping weekend at the end of the month. Like other retailers, it plans to discount a number of Apple and Beats products in hopes to reel in customers.
* Among the promotions is a 16GB Wi-Fi original iPad Air for $319, which is a savings of $40 from where it’s currently priced. There will also be a $239 16GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 2, which is $30 cheaper than its current sale price. We’ve listed all of the Apple-related deals below.
* This is just Staples’ Black Friday sale preview, so it could add more deals between now and the end of the month, but for most of these items I’d recommend checking out Walmart or Best Buy. They tend to have better deals—although this is the cheapest I’ve seen Apple TV.
* Black Friday takes place on Friday, November 28 this year, and runs through the weekend. We will continue covering promotions throughout the month, in an effort to help you sort prepare for the madness. You can check out Walmart’s ad here, and Best Buy and Target here.
