* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Lifeline: Whiteout. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pick up the popular interactive adventure title for free—a solid savings of $2.
* In Lifeline: Whiteout, you must help guide a lost adventurer to safety and aid him in finding his identity in what turns out to be a gripping story of survival. Each decision you make has a profound impact—you shape the story.
* From the App Store’s Editors Notes:
* The Lifeline series of innovative, interactive text adventures gets creepier—and much colder—with Whiteout. The twisting plot in this chilling new chapter is as vivid and captivating as ever, and rash choices can have especially deadly outcomes if you don’t weigh your options carefully. It’s tense, fast-paced fiction in perfect bite-sized servings.
* And here’s a promo clip for the game:
* Lifeline: Whiteout is available in the App Store for free.
