* Now that we’ve established that T-Mobile is the least expensive major U.S. iPhone carrier – thanks to its new policy of selling devices unsubsidized and separate of wireless services – the telco faces the ultimate test of reversing customer defection. If LTE is of prime importance to your mobile needs, you’re probably better off with AT&T and Verizon – both Rootmetrics and Consumer Reports rank AT&T’s LTE the fastest, with Verizon ruling the LTE coverage game.
* On a flip side, while T-Mobile’s LTE is only available in seven major U.S. cities, its iPhone-friendly (and speedy) HSPA+ now covers 225 million people in 229 metropolitan areas. Whether or not LTE is a key factor in determining your preferred carrier, perhaps you’re merely thinking about switching away from your telco just to show your support for T-Mobile’s “Un-Carrier” model.
* So, will you make the move come April 12?
