* Sometimes you just want to alter one simple piece of iOS without going full blown and installing WinterBoard. For times like these, a release like Alkaline is just what the doctor ordered.
* Alkaline is a brand new jailbreak tweak that makes it super easy to theme the status bar battery indicator. The best part about Alkaline is that you don’t need WinterBoard installed to use it.
* We’ve put Alkaline to the test and we’ve created a video walkthrough for you to see as well. Have a look inside to see how Alkaline works in action.
* Once installed, head to the stock Settings app to find the preference panel for Alkaline. Inside the tweak’s preferences, you’ll find two themes bundled in from the get-go: Bolus, and Habesha.

* The two stock themes look good. Bolus is a slimmer, sleeker battery indicator; while Habesha reminds me of the signal bars on the opposite side of your iPhone’s status bar. Both of these themes are bundled with Alkaline, but new themes will hopefully be created by others in the community.

* While Alkaline is a free download, the developer is asking for donations to help fight Neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a form of cancer found in early forms of the nerve cells in an embryo or fetus. This is a type of cancer that is found in young children under 10 years of age. Donations can be made from the pledge panel within the tweak’s preferences.
* Alkaline is available right now on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. If you decide to take it for a test drive, then let us know what you think about it in the comments.
