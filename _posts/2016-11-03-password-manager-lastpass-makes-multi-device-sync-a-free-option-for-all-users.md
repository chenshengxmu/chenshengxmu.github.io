* LastPass, a free of charge password manager for the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and the web, announced yesterday that all customers can now synchronize passwords across multiple devices at no additional charge.
* Previously, the app required buying a $1 per month subscription to take advantage of multi-device sync. If you manage your passwords and logins in LastPass, this should be music to your ears as most people use multiple devices.
* Here’s a message from LastPass founder Joe Siegrist:
* From day 1 here at LastPass, we’ve been on a mission to help you simplify your online life and make it a lot easier to achieve strong password security.
* By offering LastPass for free across all your devices, we’re making it that much easier for everyone to make good password habits the norm. Because when you have a password manager that goes everywhere you do, you have a strong foundation for securing and taking control of your identity.
* The new free tier requires no action on the user’s part so everyone—be it existing or new users—can take advantage of free multi-device sync right out of the box.

* LastPass continues to offer a premium $1 per month plan for customers who require advanced features such as ad removal, 1GB of encrypted cloud storage, family sharing with up to five users, priority support and other perks.
* Grab LastPass for macOS at no charge from the Mac App Store.
* LastPass for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is available for free from the App Store.
* Like 1Password, LastPass lets you easily access your saved passwords, logins and other data through a web browser at LastPass.com and use a browser extension to automate entering passwords on websites.
