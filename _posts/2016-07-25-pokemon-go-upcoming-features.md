* Pokémon GO is the biggest mobile game in U.S. history in terms of daily active users and Apple confirmed that the augmented-reality game broke an App Store record for most downloads during its first week of availability, but that doesn’t mean its creators are resting on their laurels—quite the contrary.
* As the game continues its global assault, Niantic Labs founder John Hanke teased at what’s coming next to the app: custom locations, more monsters, the ability to add customizations to lures, trading characters, more ways to play with Pokéstops and Gyms and other perks.
* It doesn’t seem that pokémons beyond the original 150 critters will make the cut though he didn’t rule out the possibility of some other creatures making their way into the game.
* “We’re looking forward to finding interesting ways to make that happen in the coming months and years,” he said. Character trading and training features are still a work in progress, Hanke cautioned, adding that his company is also looking into pokémon breeding inside the app.
* He unveiled the design of each of the three pokémon teams’ leaders.

* Until now, “You’ve only seen these guys as silhouettes because maybe we weren’t quite finished by launch day,” he said.
* The in-game Pokéstops could gain new customization options beyond a lure that ensures more critters will pop up at that location. He specifically mentioned a monster-healing Pokémon Center as a possible new function.
* “That’s a pretty cool idea that you can acquire an object that changes the function of a Pokéstop and give it a new ability,” he said.
* Unfortunately, he did not provide a timeframe for these new features.
* “We’re working really hard to keep the servers up and running,” he said. “We’re working on it, but its gonna take a little longer.”
