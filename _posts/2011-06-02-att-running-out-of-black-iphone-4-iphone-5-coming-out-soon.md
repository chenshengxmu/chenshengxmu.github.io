* Wow oh oh. This is probably the most exciting news of the day, even though it doesn’t look like much on the surface. If you look at AT&T’s website right now, you’ll see that they are running out of black iPhone 4s.
* They do have the white iPhone 4, and they even have refurbished black iPhone 4, but no new ones. What can that possibly mean? Maybe a new iPhone 5 coming out real soon?
* We’ve seen conflicting reports lately about the iPhone 5. Some say it’s coming out in June, some say in September, and some even say next year. At this point, it’s safe to say that no one has a clue what’s really going on, but like most of you, I sure hope a new iPhone 5 is going to be unveiled next week at the WWDC, even if it’s just a slightly modified version of the iPhone 4 – hello iPhone 4S.
* So, AT&T running out of black iPhone 4, is it a coincidence or a sign that the iPhone 5 is right around the corner? Your thoughts?
