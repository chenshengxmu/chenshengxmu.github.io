* Once Verizon announced its new ‘shared data plan‘ strategy, we knew that it was only a matter of time before AT&T followed suit. As the two largest carriers in the US, the companies often take queues from one another.
* AT&T’s CEO all-but-confirmed the carrier’s switch to shared data back in May of this year, but wouldn’t give any specifics on a launch date. It can’t be too far off though, as some users are already seeing the new plans…
* TechnoBuffalo posted the above photo over the weekend, which it’s reporting came from a “curious tipster.” The image shows the standard usage breakdown, but the plan that the user appears to be on is not currently available on AT&T’s website.
* Group data, accompanied by unlimited text messaging and unlimited voice minutes — this looks an awful lot like the Share Everything plans that Verizon launched last month, where prices are determined by the amount of data you need.
* AT&T hasn’t made any official announcements regarding the new plans, so it’s likely that this particular user is in a test market. But considering that the carrier has a major smartphone launch coming up in October, we’re guessing it won’t be long before we see these plans rolled out nationwide.
