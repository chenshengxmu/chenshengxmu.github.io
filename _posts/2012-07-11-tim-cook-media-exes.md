* Apple’s boss today made a surprise appearance at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, an annual retreat, to attend a session called “Iran vs. Israel”, The New York Post reported. No one knew if he would put in an appearance and upon arriving he kept a low-key profile.
* Apparently, Cook has lined up a bunch of powerful media executives for one-on-one meetings, looking to cut deals. After all, Apple is a media company (a powerful one, too) and it’s been long-rumored that Cupertino’s been persuading Hollywood moguls to provide premium programming for the mythical iTV…
* Author Claire Atkinson couldn’t resist pressing Cook on unreleased products:
* When asked if he was there in hopes of striking entertainment deals, he said, “We are talking to a lot of people here.” And might those deals be for the long-rumored Apple TV? “I can’t tell you that,” he said.
* That’s an interesting response.
* He could have just as easily got away with a simple ‘no’ unless, of course, Apple is working on a badass television set, as rumored.
* The author wasn’t any luckier with this:
* When asked what he was looking forward to at the conference, Mr. Cook smiled. “I’m looking forward to all the private discussions I’ve set up this week,” he said.
* So, basically all we know is that Cook attended the conference.
* We also know that Steve Jobs hadn’t traveled to the annual gathering since 2005 so Cook must have a compelling enough reason to book a flight to rustic Sun Valley, Idaho.

* Listening to unofficial talk on the sidelines of the conference, the reported speculates Cook might have some business with media moguls.
* The conference, full of media bigwigs, has also been buzzing about any blueprints Mr. Cook may be hiding in Apple’s magic hat. He has lined up several one-on-one meetings with media executives here, fueling speculation that he is busy cobbling together partnerships for a home entertainment expansion.
* When asked whether he wanted to strike entertainment deals, Apple’s chief executive replied that “we are talking to a lot of people here”.
* Where is Eddy Cue, though?

* Tim Cook last September promoted Cue, a 22-year Apple veteran who in the past managed iTunes services, to senior vice president of Internet software and services, a position entailing a bunch of responsibilities that encompass iTunes, iAd, iCloud, as well as Apple’s media relations with Hollywood and record labels.
* The 29-year-old event hosted by private investment firm Allen & Company gathers mostly media executives and had previously seen attendances by Silicon Valley’s top dogs, like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and others.
* Perhaps I’m reading too much into this, but one thing I know. CEOs of powerful corporations of Apple’s stature don’t waste their precious time on stuff like this.
* And don’t tell me it is a coincidence that Cook happened to attend a conference that conveniently gathers the world’s most powerful media and entertainment moguls.
* Something’s cooking here (pun intended).
* Thoughts?
