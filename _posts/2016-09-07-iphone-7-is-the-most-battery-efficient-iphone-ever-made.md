* Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have an all-new A10 Fusion SoC and will run the upcoming iOS 10 firmware; together, this spells incredible gas mileage in terms of battery life.
* Apple says the iPhone 7 is the most power efficient iPhone to date, and in today’s keynote, they claimed you should expect to get about 2 more hours of battery life out of the new handset over previous generation iPhones.
* Given all the new tech that comes in the iPhone 7, that’s a pretty big deal.
* The A10 Fusion chip is a quad-core processor, but its cores are separated into two groups: low power and high power. The high power cores handle all your app processing, while the low power cores handle backgrounded processes and help reduce power usage.
* The new low core technology uses just 1/5 the power of the high-power cores and makes the A10 Fusion chip a power-sipping power plant.
* Not only is processing more efficient, but so is gaming. The GPU in the A10 Fusion chip is up to three times faster than the previous generation A9 chip, and also uses half of the energy.
* Obviously, the iPhone 7 Plus has a larger surface area, and this means it has more room for a larger battery. As a result, you can expect better battery life from the larger 5.5-inch handset than the smaller 4.7-inch handset.
* Right from Apple’s keynote, we learn that the average battery life expectancies for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are as follows:
* iPhone 7:
* iPhone 7 Plus:
* The additional battery life is sure to help keep you away from the power outlet and reduce your dependency on external battery packs for juicing your devices up on the go.
