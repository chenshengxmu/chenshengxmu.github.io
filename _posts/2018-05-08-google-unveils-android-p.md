* During the keynote this morning kicking off its annual developers conference in Mountain View, California, Google showed off iPhone X-style gestures and navigation in Android P.
* Android P enables navigation right from the Home screen (stop me if you’ve already seen this elsewhere). Like on iPhone X, users can swipe up from the bottom edge of the display to get to a redesigned app switcher with full-screen previews of their recently used apps.
* They’re calling this Overview and it also supports Android’s Smart Text Selection feature that recognizes the meaning of the text you’re selecting and suggests relevant actions.
* In Google’s own words:
* Changing how you navigate your phone is a big deal, but small changes can make a big difference too. Android P also brings a redesigned Quick Settings, a better way to take and edit screenshots (say goodbye to the vulcan grip that was required before), simplified volume controls, an easier way to manage notifications and more.
* Android’s new system navigation is an acknowledgment that Apple’s notch design and system-wide gestures on iPhone X have set the trend for others to follow.
* Other key improvements in Android P include:
* Other enhancements and under-the-hood tweaks in Android P are highlighted on the Android blog, like DNS over TLS, encrypted backups, Protected Confirmations and more.
* Android P is set to launch this fall.
* What’s your favorite new feature in Android P so far, and why?
