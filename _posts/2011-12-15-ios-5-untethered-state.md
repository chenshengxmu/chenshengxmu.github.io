* Since Apple seeded the first beta of iOS 5 back in June of this year, the jailbreak community has been eagerly waiting for an untethered exploit. We’ve been able to jailbreak the firmware since practically day one, but it’s always been a tethered solution.
* But that could soon change thanks to iOS hacker pod2g. He’s been working hard on an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1 and keeping the community updated via Twitter and blog posts. Now it seems that he’s just hit a major milestone in his progress…
* A few days ago, we told you that the coding was done on the jailbreak for all applicable A4 devices. Today, pod2g has submitted another update to his blog, stating that testing on the A4 devices is done and he’s now looking to move on to A5 devices:
* “Hello my friends, I know that I’ve been silent yesterday and that it was annoying. Sorry for this, but I had to organize things for the release. Also, I’ve tested iPad 1 and it worked. Today I hope I can test a 3GS.
* BTW: please don’t propose to be a beta tester because I’m too paranoid, fearing leaks. Now the time to finalize the jailbreak for old devices, fix some stability issues and package the whole. That will take some days.
* In the meanwhile, I’m starting the research for iPad 2 and 4S. I’ll take you informed of my progress. Finally, I want to thank all who donated. I can now buy both devices! I don’t know what to say. Thank you very much my friends. Have a good day! See ya.”
* We can tell from the blog post that the jailbreak is fairly close to being finished for older devices. And while we don’t have any information regarding iPad 2 and iPhone 4S compatibility, we can see that he is looking to start testing on these devices very soon.
* The anticipation mounting for the the iOS 5 untethered jailbreak kind of reminds us of Comex’s JailbreakMe 3.0 release. We’ll keep you updated on pod2g’s progress and let you know when the actual jailbreak is available the moment it hits. Stay tuned.
