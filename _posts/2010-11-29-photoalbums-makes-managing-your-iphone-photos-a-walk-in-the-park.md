* Call me crazy, but I’m convinced that there’s a special roundtable meeting each week at Apple where all they do is sit around projector and examine what jailbreak apps released the previous week.
* I can hear it now; “Uh, yeah, and uh, PhotoAlbums+! Yeah, uh, that looks like something we should have had from the, uh, very beginning, let’s use that!”
* Okay, so that probably doesn’t happen, but PhotoAlbums+ is the latest example in a long line of Cydia store releases that will inevitably appear in an upcoming release of iOS. Why do I say this? Take a look inside and see what makes this tweak a no brainer for Photo Album users.
* PhotoAlbums+ allows you to easily create new albums directly on your iPhone and move pictures and movies between your Camera Roll and your newly created albums. It also adds the ability to password protect specific albums if you desire to keep your photos away from prying eyes.
* Those features are wonderful, but what really makes PhotoAlbums+ work is the sheer simplicity of it all. There are no app icons, and no settings added to the mix to complicate things; it’s neatly integrated into the stock photos app for familiarity and ease of use.
* The only change you’ll notice is a plus sign in the upper right hand corner of your photos app. As you may have guessed, the plus sign allows you to add new photo albums; it also adds new ‘move’ functionality to your sharing options which allows you to distribute your photos, not at all unlike managing your email.

* Deleting albums is familiar and easy as well, just swipe an album, and you’re given the option to delete. What’s more, is that deleting an album only deletes the album, and not the content contained within; everything is simply moved back to your Camera Roll, so you won’t lose a thing.
* To top things off, PhotoAlbums+ is completely transparent; basically, every app and process, including iTunes syncing, thinks it’s a native part of the iPhone’s functionality. That means that all of your apps and syncing will work like usual, just with the benefit of extra albums.
* If that sounds as good to you as it does to us, then I suggest you take your jailbroken iPhone right over to the Cydia store and plop down the $2.99 the developers are asking for this tweak. Afterwards, we’d like to hear what you think about what PhotoAlbums+ brings to the table.
