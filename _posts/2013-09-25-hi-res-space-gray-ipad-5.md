* With the new iPhones now unveiled and shipping, the rumor mill’s attention of course turns to Apple’s tablet lines. It’s widely believed that we’ll see a media event for a new iPad and iPad mini next month.
* And as with the new iPhones, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The new mini is said to look a lot like its predecessor, with a Retina display, and the new full-sized iPad should look like, well, this…
* New hi-res photos surfaced this morning, courtesy of Sonny Dickson, of an alleged rear iPad 5 shell. Now, we’ve seen plenty of these in recent months, but this particular one is in the new ‘Space Gray’ colorway.

* Both Apple’s new iPhone and late-model iPods come in this color, and last week photos of a Gray iPad mini shell popped up. So, despite initial iPad 5 leaks showing the ‘Slate’ color, it appears it’s being replaced.
* In fact, it’s been said that Apple will offer its new tablets in the same 3 color options as the new iPhone. And while we’ve seen rear shells in both white/silver and now Space Gray, we have yet to see anything in gold.
* Apple’s two new iPads are expected to feature variations of the new A7 processor, as well as other internal upgrades. The mini is also presumed to receive a Retina display, and the full-sized iPad a complete redesign.
* Nothing has been confirmed yet, but we are anticipating an iPad event sometime in October.
