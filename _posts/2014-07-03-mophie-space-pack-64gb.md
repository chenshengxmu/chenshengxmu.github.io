* As Samsung’s latest ‘Wall Huggers’ Galaxy ad suggests – you, sir, are constantly on the lookout for power outlets and tethered to the wall because there’s no way you could replace that sealed battery with a spare one. If that ad hit a nerve, why not consider a battery pack for your device?
* Accessory maker Mophie has just what you need.
* Not only does its Space Pack iPhone 5/5s case double your iPhone’s runtime with a built-in 1700mAh battery, the 16 or 32 gigabytes of on-board flash chips increase your iPhone’s own built-in storage. Today, Mophie added a new variant to the lineup featuring a whopping 64 gigabytes. The best bit: it’s available for pre-order now…
* The 64 gig case will set you back $249.95. Mophie estimates 64 gigabytes is enough to hold 32,000 photos, 28 hours of video and 18,000 songs.
* If you own a 64GB iPhone 5/5s, the 64 gig case will basically double your iPhone’s storage to a whopping 128 gigabytes.

* Catch 22: the Space Pack’s on-board flash chips don’t seamlessly integrate with the iPhone’s built-in memory – you can access movies, photos, music, documents and other file types on it only through a companion iOS app.
* Don’t worry, sensitive documents and your nude shots can be protected with a 4-digit passcode.
* AirDrop, Apple’s device-to-device sharing mechanism, is supported so you can share files with other AirDrop-friendly devices. The app does Airplay, too, allowing you to send your media to an AirPlay-compatible TV, monitor or speaker.
* You can pre-order the 64GB Space Pack in black only for $249.95 over at the Mophie webstore. As a reminder, the 16/32GB edition costs $149.95/$179.95. The 16GB model comes in black or white while its 32GB counterpart comes in red only.
