* To say that Candy Crush Saga, a game that challenges players to match candies in a combination of three or more, is a hit would be an understatement. You can’t scroll through Facebook or walk through the mall without seeing it.
* And today, The Telegraph added some context to the success. Speaking with Tommy Palm of developer King, the news outlet is reporting that Candy Crush has surpassed the 500 million download mark, just one year after launching…
* From The Telegraph’s Sophie Curtis:
* “The past year has been one of the most exciting times for King since Candy Crush Saga launched on mobile,” says Tommy Palm, Games Guru at King.
* “The incredible milestone of more than half a billion downloads of the game, as well as the continued enthusiasm from our community, really delights the entire King team. Fans can look forward to even more exciting new Candy Crush Saga content over the coming months, including an exciting new twist to the game.”
* Over 150 billion individual games of Candy Crush have been played to date, and one in every 23 Facebook users is now a fan of the title. Of course, it’s worth noting these numbers include downloads from iOS, Android and Facebook.
* Candy Crush Saga started as a one-level game on King.com’s website, was brought over to Facebook in April 2012, and then to smartphones in November 2012. It’s currently the #1 grossing app in the US App Store, and #11 in top free.
