* If you’ve ever accidentally closed a Safari window loaded with dozens of tabs, you know how daunting a task recreating them from your browsing history can be. Like many people, I used to be a huge fan of Google’s Chrome before I eventually made a switch to Safari.
* One of Chrome’s simple yet tremendously useful features that I’ve always valued is a switch in settings telling the app to open with all the windows from your last browsing session.
* Apple’s desktop Safari, too, has had that feature for a while now but did you know of a hidden option for reopening all windows from the last session?
* Here’s what you can do in case you close a Safari window full of tabs by accident, or a single tab for that matter.
* Step 1: Launch Safari on your Mac.
* Step 2: Choose an option labeled Reopen All Windows from Last Session in Safari’s History menu.

* This productivity tip is especially useful for those who keep all their tabs consolidated in a single window. After accidentally clicking the window’s close button, or hitting the Command (⌘) – W combination on your keyboard (which does the same thing), simply use Safari’s menu item to reopen them all in one fell swoop.
