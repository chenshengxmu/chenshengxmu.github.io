* Apple Support’s official YouTube channel just published two new mini-tutorial videos.
* The first 25-second clip educates users on a common photography technique that invites them to use shapes behind their subject to create a natural frame for their photographs.
* The other video details composing shots with the telephoto camera found on the back of the company’s iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X smartphone models. “The telephoto lens does more than zoom—it can simplify your composition,” the company writes.
* Apple’s latest iPhone photography tutorial videos follow yesterday’s video that taught users how to experiment with the color sliders in the stock Photos app.
* Do you like these mini photography tutorials from Apple?
* I think the videos are kinda cute and their attractive format makes them instantly shareable.
