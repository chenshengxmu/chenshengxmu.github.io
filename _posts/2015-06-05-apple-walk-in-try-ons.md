* Since its April debut, the Apple Watch has been exclusively available through the convoluted process where you favorited your preferred model on the webstore or in the Apple Store app before visiting an Apple Store for your try-on appointment.
* But as availability of both the device itself and the bands has been improving lately, the company is now inviting prospective buyers for walk-in try-ons at their local Apple Store, as indicated by MacRumors.
* Moreover, Apple Stores have begun offering workshops on the device.
* “Attend a workshop and we’ll show you how to get started with notifications, Glances and more,” reads an updated notice on Apple’s website.
* “Or just walk in to try Apple Watch on,” adds the message on Apple’s website.

* Prior to today’s change, Apple used to exclusively offer try-on appointments for the Apple Watch. It’s worth pointing out that company stores are still accepting try-on appointments for those who want to ensure their time with the device.
* Apple said Monday it would kick off in-store sales of the wearable device as it hits an additional seven countries on June 26.
* “All orders placed through May, with the sole exception of Apple Watch 42 mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Space Black Link Bracelet, will ship to customers within two weeks,” said the firm in a press release.
* “At that time, we’ll also begin selling some models in our Apple Retail Stores.”
* An email Apple sent to customers who ordered the 42mm Space Black Stainless Steel Apple Watch with Space Black Link Bracelet cautions they “may not be able to pick up the device at their nearest Apple Store two weeks from now.”
* Availability of Apple Watch bands has improved, too.
* All $49 Sport bands in both sizes except the black, along with the $149 38mm Milanese Loop, both $149 38mm and 42mm Classic Buckle and all $149 Leather Loops in all colors in both medium and large, are now shipping in 24 hours from Apple’s webstore.
* The $249 Modern Buckle is currently unavailable and the 42mm Milanese Loop is shipping in five to six weeks.
