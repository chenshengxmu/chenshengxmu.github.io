* Apple’s 10-Q filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission shows purchase commitments for the March quarter dropping from $4.5 billion two quarters ago to just $904 million. Of course, two quarters ago Apple was ramping up iPhone 5 production and investing heavily in then new in-cell touch displays. Still, that’s a huge drop.
* One clever interprets this data point as a sign of the iPhone 5S not needing new manufacturing processes, in turn proving it’s gonna look just the same as the current-generation iPhone 5. Notable changes will be from the inside, like the speedier CPU/GPU, better cameras and what not. Man, I should have been an analyst…
* Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty stated the obvious in her note to clients (via BusinessInsider, emphasis mine):
* Lower planned purchases of production equipment sets up for higher iPhone 5S margin. The 10-Q discloses $904M of commitments for equipment purchases compare to $4.5B just two quarters ago when Apple invested in new in-cell touch displays for the iPhone 5.
* The decrease is likely due to iPhone 5S not requiring significant hardware changes, therefore iPhone GM could be much higher in C2H13.
* She also says Apple stands poised to secure better deals on NAND components going forward, pointing to the recently unveiled 128GB iPad 4, due tomorrow.
* Apple typically issues a major iPhone redesign every two years. Each mid-cycle refresh is basically a specs bump up. As the current iPhone 5 design debuted in September 2012, a major face-lift shouldn’t be expected this year.

* Apart from a few leaks here and there, not much is known about the iPhone 5S.
* Per usual, the rumor-mill churns out a number of theories, ranging from wild predictions of a jumbo-sized iPhone to the iPhone 5S in colors to a substantial speed increase via the A7 chip and a 13-megapixel camera.
* Apple’s 10-Q (PDF document) also states a whopping $10 billion in capital expenditure this fiscal year, a $2 billion increase year-over-year. By comparison, Intel dedicated up to $12.9 billion in capital expenditure and Samsung’s semiconductor cap ex stands at $12.2 billion.
* Finance boss Peter Oppenheimer told investors on a conference call that Apple will invest “a little bit under $1 billion in retail stores“.
* And the other $9 billion?
* This will go “in a variety of areas”, but mostly on manufacturing equipment for new products:
* We’re buying equipment that we will own that we will put in our partners facilities.
* Nine billion dollars on equipment in just twelve months is a lot of money, even by Apple’s standards.
* Maybe Apple is switching to Liquidmetal?

* If you ask experts, mass-scale manufacturing of this alloy is at least five years away so Liquidmetal is the least possible answer.
* Another (and likely) possibility: Apple could be looking to update the look of most of its products throughout the year. And don’t forget the ongoing expenses on iCloud enhancements.
* Oh, and that Project Azaela, too.
* Of course, there’s also that constantly looming third option: a standalone TV set, requiring new plants and a bunch of new manufacturing equipment.
