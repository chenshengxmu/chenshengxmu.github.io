* Would you like to make your iPad’s banner notifications span the entire width of the iPad’s screen? Now you can, courtesy of a new jailbreak tweak entitled NCPad.
* NCPad features no options or settings to configure, simply install it, and it begins working immediately. It won’t expand the entire Notification Center width as its name might suggest, but it will increase the width of banner notifications, which in turn allows you to read more of the contents of the notification.
* NCPad is a free jailbreak tweak available from Cydia’s ModMyi repo. You’ll need a jailbroken iPad running iOS 5.0.1 or above to take advantage of the tweak.
* If you decide to give it a try, let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
