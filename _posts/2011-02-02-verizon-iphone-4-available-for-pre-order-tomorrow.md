* According to a Press Release from Apple, all existing Verizon customer will be able to pre-order an iPhone 4 tomorrow from Apple or Verizon‘s website to be picked up or delivered beginning on the 10th of the month.
* “Beginning on Wednesday, February 9, all qualified customers will be able to order an iPhone 4 on Verizon through the Apple Store (www.apple.com) for delivery or reserve for in-store pick up beginning February 10.
* Beginning at 7 a.m. local time on Thursday, February 10, iPhone 4 on Verizon will be available to all qualified customers at Apple’s retail stores. iPhone 4 will also be available at more than 2,000 Verizon Wireless Communication Stores nationwide.”
* So basically, anyone who wants a Verizon iPhone should get it by the 11th of the month.
* All these dates are quite confusing. I think Verizon wanted to extend the pre-orders and orders on several days to make sure their system doesn’t crash as bad as AT&T’s did in the past. If everything goes well for Verizon, be prepared to hear from them about how well pre-orders went compared to AT&T.
* I really don’t think millions of people will jump on the Verizon iPhone opportunity at first, so I doubt Verizon will have any technical issue taking these pre-orders.
* What do you think?
