* As you’re probably well aware of, we love it when criminals get their comeuppance. It’s even a little extra entertaining if the crooks get nabbed due to a lack of common sense. Such is the case for our next 2 villains.
* KPLCTV is reporting that 2 men have been arrested in Jennings, Louisiana in connection with multiple ‘forged iPad deliveries’. Apparently, over the last few months, a FedEx driver has been stealing iPads from his truck and forging customers’ signatures…
* After stealing the tablets, authorities say that Michael Wright sold them to friend Shannon Guillory for — get this — $200 a piece.  All together the thieves were able to lift 14 iPads before law enforcement finally caught up with them.
* Of the 14 tablets taken, 13 were sold off and 1 was given away. So far, the Jennings Police Department has only been able to confirm that 6 of the stolen iPads have been recovered.
* Wright faces 20 felony counts, including 14 counts of theft over $500, and 6 counts of forgery. His ‘business partner,’ Shannon Guillory, is being held on 13 counts of illegal possession of stolen property.
* I can’t believe these guys didn’t think that customers would eventually call in about their missing iPads. After they confirm the tablets are making it to the delivery truck, there’s only one person left to point the finger at: the driver.
* While I feel bad for their brain cells, I feel even worse for the victims. Only 6 iPads returned? Surely FedEx would reimburse the customers whose merchandise was stolen by a company driver. Or would that depend on if they had insurance?
* Thoughts?
