* Claimed CAD drawing published Monday by the usually reliably OnLeaks provides yet another indication that Apple’s next-generation iPad mini will be the slimmest 7.9-inch iPad yet, basically supporting the theory that the iPad mini 4 will match the thinness of the iPad Air 2.
* The device’s profile is expected to go from 7.5mm down to the iPad Air 2 thinness of just 6.1mm, or less than the iPad mini 3 thickness of 7.5mm. In addition to the technical drawing of the iPad mini 4, OnLeaks posted a nice hands-on video showcasing a claimed iPad mini 4 housing.
* Here’s the claimed CAD drawing.
* In addition to borrowing the iPad Air design, Apple’s next iPad mini is expected to adopt a number of features from its bigger brother, including an eight-megapixel iSight camera with Burst and Panorama modes, the Apple-designed A8 processor, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, a laminated display with anti-reflective coating for improved viewing experience and more.
* And this is the video of the claimed iPad mini 4 chassis.
* Notice the chassis has two rows of ten holes alongside the Lightning port versus four rows of fourteen holes on the iPad mini 3.
* If the rumor pans out, the iPad mini will receive its most substantial refresh yet. Last year, Apple essentially refreshed the iPad mini by slapping Touch ID on the iPad mini 3 while adding a new gold color option.
* Apple is expected to unveil new iPhones, iPads and a next-generation Apple TV at a rumored September 9 media event.
