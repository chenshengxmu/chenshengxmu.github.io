* Fortnite, the Battle Royale game that’s been taking the world by storm, received a big update on Tuesday. The iOS app now reads version 4.0, as it ushers in Season 4 with new locations to explore, new rewards to earn, and drag and drop support on the quickbar for quickly organizing inventory items. Check out the full release notes below.
* SEASON 4 IS HERE – Season 4 is starting off with a BANG. The comet has crashed and brings new locations to explore! Jump in and witness the aftermath of the impact while you level up your Battle Pass and earn all new loot.
* HOP ROCKS – The comet has left a mark on the island… Visit the crater and you’ll find glowing rocks all around. Consume them and lift off with low gravity!
* DRAG AND DROP – The quickbar now supports drag and drop for dropping and rearranging inventory items.
* Additional stability improvements and bug fixes.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, Fornite for iOS is the same 100-player PvP game you know from PS4, Xbox One, PC and Mac. It’s the same maps, same gameplay, and cross-platform compatible.
