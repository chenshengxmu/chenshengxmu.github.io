* As we sit and wait for Apple to release its earnings report for the June quarter, let’s take a look at how AT&T did. The nation’s second largest carrier has had an interesting 3-months, having to deal with increased competition from the scrappy T-Mobile.
* The company just released its Q2 financials, and most of the numbers look good thus far. The carrier says it added 551,000 postpaid subscribers from March to June, helping it fuel earnings of 67 cents per share and post a solid revenue of $32 billion…
* As for handset mix, AT&T says that it sold a record number of Android handsets (though it doesn’t give specifics) and activated 3.7 million iPhones last quarter. That’s a hair less than the 3.9M iPhones its rival Verizon activated during the same period.
* Overall the company added 1.2 million smartphone subscribers over the quarter, and says that 88% of its phone sales over the three month stretch were smartphones. It also noted that more than a third of its customers are now using an LTE device.
* Last week, AT&T launched Next, a new device upgrade program, in response to T-Mobile’s Jump plan. The carrier also introduced new 300MB and 2GB data plans yesterday.
