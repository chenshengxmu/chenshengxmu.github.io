* In addition to seeding the fourth beta of iOS 8 this morning, Apple has also released the fourth Developer Preview of its new OS X Yosemite operating system. The update comes two weeks after Preview 3, and well over a month after Apple announced Yosemite at WWDC.
* The update is labeled as build preview 4 1.0 and can be downloaded via an update in the Mac App Store, or as a full download from Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s recently-launched public Yosemite Beta Seed program yet…

* Also, Apple has released iTunes 12.0 and Yosemite Recovery Update 1.0 this morning. iTunes 12 features an ‘elegant new design’ and adds support for Family Sharing—a new feature Apple introduced at WWDC— improved playlists, a redesigned information window, and more.
