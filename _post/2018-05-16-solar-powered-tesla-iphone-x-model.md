* If you’re looking for a solar-powered mobile phone and money isn’t a concern, consider the iPhone X Tesla model from Russian accessory maker Caviar. The device, which pays homage to the carmaker, will set you back at least $4,500, depending on the exchange rate.
* As first spotted by AppleInsider, the iPhone X Tesla model features a large solar panel on the back which feeds into a dedicated battery. To activate the charge, you press a power button on the rear.
* Made from carbon fiber, the Tesla features anodized buttons on either size with gilded decorative elements on the rear. The assembly offers iP67 resistance.
* As AppleInsider explains, the panels  will add considerable girth to the phone:
* Rather than being a case sold on its own, the Tesla appears to be attached directly to the iPhone X itself, with the overall thickness of the device being considerably pronounced compared to the original because of the solar panel. The increased thickness from the original’s 7.7mm to 16.2mm is large enough that the rear camera bump is now a recess.
* Caviar plans on making 999 iPhone X Tesla models, with each device individually numbered in the order they are produced. The first unit, which Caviar plans on giving to Musk, will feature special engraving that says, “Made on Earth by Humans.”
* You may recall, earlier this year, Musk’s SpaceX launched a Tesla car into space.

* Caviar is offering the 64GB iPhone X Tesla model for 284,000 rubles, or approximately $4,555. The 256GB model, meanwhile, will set you back 299,000 rubles or $4,805, excluding taxes and customs duties.
* In an interesting twist, Caviar only requires a payment after the item has been inspected, and the transaction is “accompanied by a personal consultant,” whatever that means.
* With next-generation iPhones on the horizon, I’m not sure now is the right time to be buying new mobiles phones. Still, if you’re looking for something different and want to splurge, go for it.
* You can learn more about the iPhone X Tesla model, including how to buy, on the Caviar website.
