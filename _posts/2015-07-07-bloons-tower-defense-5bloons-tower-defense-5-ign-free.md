* This promotion is only available through IGN so don’t bother visiting the App Store, where Tower Defense 5 for iPhone and iPod touch currently sells for $2.99, with the iPad edition fetching an additional $4.99, so you’re looking at a cool $8 saved.
* “Bloons TD 5 isn’t just a great tower defense game on the App Store – it’s a great tower defense game, period,” IGN’s editors wrote. “Build awesome towers, choose your favorite upgrades, hire cool new Special Agents, and pop every last invading Bloon in the best ever version of the popular tower defense series.”
* Step 1: To grab your free download, first visit IGN’s promo page using Safari on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac.

* Step 4: Your promo code should appear on the screen.

* If the Bloons promo codes are unavailable in your country, try visiting the aforesaid webpage through an anonymous proxy web tool.
* I wholeheartedly recommend the free of charge SmartHide Online Anonymizer.
* Simply choose the US Anonymizer option on the SmartHide webpage and paste the IGN promo URL into the text field, as illustrated below.

* The codes expire on August 9, 2015.
* However, the offer is valid only on the US iTunes Store so our non-US readers may want to create themselves a US App Store account in order to game the system and take advantage of this freebie.
* Bloons Tower Defense 5 made its App Store debut in March of 2014. The iPhone edition was free briefly only once and the iPad rendition never.
* The most recent update has introduced additional content and features, including the fun and frantic Wattle Trees map, an all-new beginner map called Sprint Track and an auto round start option (available in the Pause menu) which lets you play the game without any pause between rounds.
* Bloons Tower Defense 5 highlights:
* Bloons Tower Defense 5 keeps your progress synchronized between devices through iCloud. However, developers advise that players manually save their progress to iCloud after each victory or purchase.
* The game requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 4.3 or later.
