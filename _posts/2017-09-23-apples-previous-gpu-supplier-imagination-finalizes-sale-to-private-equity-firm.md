* When Apple informed GPU component supplier Imagination Technology back in April that they would no longer be requiring their services, their shares dropped by nearly 50% by the following day. It has been a bit of a bitter separation, with Imagination saying that Apple would be unable to create their own GPU without violating their patents.
* In June, Imagination Technology announced they were looking to find a buyer for their company, and salvage their tanking stock price. Apple supplied a significant portion of their business, and losing that contract meant they lost their biggest client.

* Apple’s move to bring their GPU content in-house culminated in the new A11 Bionic processor that debuted in the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Apple specifically mentioned during their keynote the Apple-designed GPU that was meant to help facilitate their new features like AR.
* Now, several months later, Imagination Technology has finally found a buyer in Canyon Bridge, a China-backed private Silicon Valley firm. Canyon Bridge is going to be paying £550 million ($743.2 million) to acquire them. First reported by the Financial Times, Canyon Bridge is backed by the Chinese fund Yitai Capital.
* Currently, Imagination is still feuding with Apple, and time will tell what settlement will be made. Whether it amounts to a lawsuit, or a settlement, remains to be seen.
