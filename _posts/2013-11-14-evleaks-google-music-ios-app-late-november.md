* Google Music launched back in November 2011 with a music store, Google+ integration, artist hubs, carrier billing and initial support from Universal Music Group, EMI and Sony Music Entertainment, along with other smaller labels. Fast-forward two years and we still don’t have a native iOS app.
* Google in its typical fashion has tried to appease its disgruntled Apple audience with a Google Music iOS web app.
* Alas, nobody cared!
* The search Goliath later promised to bring a native app and a report recently claimed it would launch later this month. Today, a prominent leaker has corroborated that the native Google Music iOS app is indeed due by the end of the month…
* According to @evlekas, Google Music for iOS launch is “imminent”.
* Launch imminent for native Google Music iOS app. First reported: http://t.co/q49KTHAVzP

* Engadget’s Matt Brian wrote in early-October that Google’s native Music app for the iPhone and iPad has been in the works for quite some time.
* “We’re told that while employees have been invited to test the app, Google still needs to fix a few bugs before it’s ready for release,” Matt wrote.
* Google’s new Android head said during a May interview at the D11 conference that Google Music would be making its way to iOS “in the next few weeks”.
* A native app would go a long way toward persuading iDevice users to actually use Google’s music service.
* Google Music doesn’t have as vast a catalog as iTunes, but it makes up for that with cheaper tracks and ubiquitousness – the music service is accessible through Android devices and via computing platform with a web browser. It also has a scan-and-match feature akin to iTunes Match and is available in many European markets.
* In the meantime, you can use alternative Google Music clients such as gMusic, a 99-cent download from the App Store.
* The app made TIME’s 50 Best iPhone Apps list last year and has been updated recently with support for Google’s All Access paid streaming music service, which runs $9.99 per month and offers offline listening.
* Would you consider a native Google Music app if/when it becomes available?
