* Anyone with an iPhone 6s or newer can use 3D Touch gestures on their Home screen icons to access Quick Action menus with various app shortcuts. As useful as they can be, these menus can look incredibly bland on stock devices.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called SB3DTouchColor by iOS developer Cole Cabral improves the aesthetic of these menus. It does so by colorizing them to match the dominant color of the respective app icon.
* Above, you can see how the tweak works. The Quick Action menu for the App Store becomes blue, the one for the Notes app becomes yellow, and so on. As you can see, the tweak tints any accompanying widgets, as well.
* The concept behind SB3DTouchColor might ring a bell, and that’s because CPDigitalDarkroom’s Cuttlefish tweak provided a similar makeover back in 2016. That aside, there are subtle differences in how each tweak looks – Cuttlefish seems to use duller color schemes, while SB3DTouchColor uses bolder colors.
* The fun doesn’t stop there; SB3DTouchColor adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer doesn’t include a respring button in the Settings app, but we’d recommend finding a way to respring on your own after tweaking the settings. This ensures that your configuration gets appropriately saved.
* All in all, SB3DTouchColor is a solid tweak and works well for spicing up your Home Screen’s Quick Action menus.We especially like that you can choose between automatic and custom color modes, as some people are sure to have more of a color preference than others. Even if your device doesn’t support 3D Touch out of the box, you can use a tweak like Force3DAppShortcuts to simulate them and SB3DTouchColor will play nicely with it.
* SB3DTouchColor works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices. Unfortunately, it isn’t available from any of Cydia‘s default repositories. To download SB3DTouchColor, you’ll need to add Cole Cabral’s beta repository to Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you should be able to find and install SB3DTouchColor by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
