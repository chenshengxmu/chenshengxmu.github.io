* I’ve been on the lookout on a case to protect my iPhone 6 Plus and think Twelve South’s just-launched SurfacePad fits the bill. Priced at $39.99 for the iPhone 6 and $49.99 for the iPhone 6 Plus, the SurfacePad is a premium “buttery soft leather jacket” that protects the new iPhones without adding bulk and weight or concealing their gorgeous design.
* It has reinforced stitching around the perimeter for long-term durability, with soft microfiber lines protecting your precious investment from the inside and soft napa leather protecting your device from the outside.
* Both the $39.99 SurfacePad for iPhone 6 and $49.99 for iPhone 6 Plus are available through the Twelve South website.
* I’m liking the fact that the inside front cover has two slots for plastic cards so if you’re not a fan of Apple Pay, you can keep your IDs, bank and credit cards in the SurfacePad.

* The reinforced stitching around the perimeter sure is a nice touch!

* As pictured top of post and below, the case enables hands-free use thanks to a built-in stand that lets you use your device for FaceTime, taking timed group shots and what not, without taking the sleeve off.

* “Flex the back of SurfacePad to put iPhone into display mode, and you’ll be ready for hands-free selfies, watching game highlights at the bar or catching a TED Talk in your favorite coffee shop,” Twelve South says.

* Check out the promotional video.
* “We designed SurfacePad for users who were so tired of bulky cases they chose no case at all,” the blurb says (yours truly fits the description perfectly).
* The SurfacePad is available in Black, Red, White and a new Camel finish to fit your tastes and the iPhone 6’s Gold, White and Space Gray color ways.
