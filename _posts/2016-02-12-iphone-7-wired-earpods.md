* Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7 will include an all-digital, wired edition of the EarPods headphones that will connect to the handset’s Lightning port, not the wireless edition as previously rumored.
* According to an analyst note from Barclays, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Apple has not yet purchased a license from its supplier Cirrus Logic that would permit the company to use Cirrus’ active noise-canceling software.
* Cirrus technology would be needed to filter out background noise during phone calls were Apple to ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of wireless Bluetooth headphones.
* “We believe Apple is including just the digital (via Lightning) headphone in the iPhone 7 this year,” analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn wrote in their note to investors.
* As for the supposed wireless edition of the EarPods that prior rumors said would ship with the next iPhone, the analysts don’t think Apple is in a position to make such a move this year.
* “We still believe there is potential for Apple to add active noise cancelling in the iPhone 7s,” which is likely to come out in 2017.
* “Apple will need to provide a digital headset inbox but likely was not willing to spend the extra cost for the active noise cancelling functionality,” they concluded.
* Apple is currently interested in an audio codec from Cirrus which would let the EarPods connect to the iPhone’s Lightning connector rather than via the standard 3.5mm analog jack.
* As mentioned, another codec from Cirrus would be needed to enable wireless EarPods to sample audio captured by an in-line microphone in order to cancel out unwanted sounds.
* The analysts added that the space currently occupied by the 3.5mm audio jack could be used in the iPhone 7 for another speaker. Cirrus would reportedly provide an amplifier for that speaker.
