* Flickr has released its list of camera brands that were used the most to capture photos on the photography website in 2014. The top five were: Canon at 13.4 percent, Apple at 9.6 percent, Nikon at 9.3 percent, Samsung at 5.6 percent, and Sony at 4.2 percent.
* Apple overtook Nikon for the second place spot in 2014. The iPhone 5, 4S and 4 were the top three for both 2013 and 2014, with the Canon EOS 7D and the Nikon D7000 unchanged in 4th and fifth place respectively.

* It’s incredibly interesting that Apple has overtaken big photography brand Nikon, on a professional photography focused site like Flickr. The Yahoo-owned property had more than 10 billion photos that were uploaded by more than 100 million unique users in 2014. Of course, not all people on Flickr are professionals. But still, interesting.
