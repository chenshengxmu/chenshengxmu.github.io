* Since its April 2015 debut, the Apple Watch to this date runs Apple Watch OS 1.0 as Apple has yet to release an update to the wrist-worn device’s operating system. As per a new report filed by 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman, a software update is in the works that’ll improve the Apple Watch’s connectivity with other devices like the Apple TV.
* Other noteworthy perks reportedly include enhancements aimed at strengthening the security of the Apple Watch, boosting built-in health and fitness capability, bolstering Wi-Fi features and tightening integration with third-party applications.
* In addition, a new Apple TV hardware with a “fancy” new remote, even tighter Apple Watch integration and support for downloadable applications is on its way, too.
* Citing “a proven source”, the report adds that Apple is readying major updates for the Apple TV in both the hardware and software departments, including Apple Watch integration.
* A “Find my Watch” feature, currently missing in the Apple Watch OS 1.0, will help you find a misplaced device, presumably on a world map akin to the existing Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac features in iOS and OS X.
* Another reported enhancements is the ability to remotely lock or wipe your stolen Apple Watch. The Apple Watch relies on its connected iPhone for GPS and Wi-Fi functionality, but it can also connect to previously stored Wi-Fi networks on its own.
* Should a “Find my Watch” feature make its way into the Apple Watch, Apple might enhance the device’s Wi-Fi features in order to allow the device to be easily located by iCloud even when the iPhone is out of range.
* To tackle this issue, Apple will reportedly employ a feature called “Smart Leashing” that will prompt the device to tap its built-in Wi-Fi in order to establish its location relative to the iPhone’s last known location.
* Find My Watch will even notify you via a light tap on your wrist should you accidentally leave your iPhone behind.
* “The source cautioned that the Find my Watch and Smart Leashing features could be farther off than others in development, as they may require a more capable and independent wireless chip in a next-generation Watch,” reads the report.
* Health and fitness improvements include notifying a user about an irregular heart beat. “Apple hopes to add a blood pressure monitor and sleep tracking features in the near future, with glucose/blood sugar sensors scheduled for the longer term,” notes the author.
* Another feature we should be looking forward to: third-party watch face Complications. Borrowing terms from traditional watchmaking, Complications Complications are various nuggets of information that can be optionally added to some of Apple’s build-in faces, such as moon phases, battery and fitness levels, battery charge and current date, among others.
* A source claims that a set of Twitter Complications are being worked on, allowing you to display a count of unread Twitter mentions, “while a larger view could show the text of a recent Twitter mention.”
* As for the Apple TV, expect a “fancier” remote that will be bundled with the rumored hardware overhaul of the device.
* Expected to make its debut at WWDC next month, the new Apple TV box will offer deep Siri integration and the ability to run third-party applications via an Apple TV App Store and a new feature for developers called “TVKit,” Gurman has apparently learned.
