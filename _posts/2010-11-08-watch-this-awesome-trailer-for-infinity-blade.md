title: Watch This- Awesome Trailer for Infinity Blade
---
* I’m not a gamer so I’m hardly ever impressed by any video game. But wow, this trailer for Infinity Blade is in its own category and definitely stands out from what I’ve ever seen on the iPhone.
* There is no indication about when Infinity Trailer will be released or how much it will cost, but this non-gamer can’t wait to get his hands on it. Check out the video below to see the full trailer…
* What do you think? Impressive, huh?
