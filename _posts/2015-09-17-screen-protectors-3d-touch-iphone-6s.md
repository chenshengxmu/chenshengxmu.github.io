* No need to fret over whether or not your ‘Made for iPhone’ screen protector will work with the new iPhone 6s because covering its display with a protective film won’t cause issues with 3D Touch.
* As confirmed by Apple, screen protectors which follow the company’s guidelines will continue to work with the 3D Touch pressure-sensing feature that the new phones come equipped with.
* “Screen overlays that follow our guidelines will continue to work with 3D Touch,” according to an alleged email that Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing honcho, sent to 3D Techtronics, a company that builds screen protectors for mobile devices.
* According to the official design guidelines for the development of iPhone cases, screen protectors can be up to 0.3mm thick, must be electrically conductive and not have air gaps between the touchscreen.
* In addition, Apple said previously that existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cases will work with the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices as well, despite their indiscernible increase in thickness.

* As you know, 3D Touch provides shortcuts to various functions in iOS 9.
* You can on Home screen icons to bring up an overlay with commonly used options, as well as use 3D Touch within apps to peek into content quickly and pop it open.
* Unlike tap-and-holding that takes some time to register, 3D Touch works immediately and doesn’t clash with other tap-based gestures. In a nutshell, 3D Touch is reliant on force sensors embedded into the iPhone’s backlight, which is located inside the display assembly itself.

* When you apply pressure to the iPhone 6s’s screen, these sensors measure microscopic changes in the distance between the cover glass and the backlight.
* Data is then fed to software algorithms which take into consideration other factors such as data provided by the touch sensor itself and accelerometer in order to determine to amount of pressure the user exerts on the display.

* 3D Touch is exclusive to the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* The new phones are scheduled to launch in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States on Friday, September 25.
