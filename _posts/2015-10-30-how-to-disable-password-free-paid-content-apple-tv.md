* You are probably aware that you can disable password prompts altogether for free downloads made on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac. As an added layer of protection, iOS and OS X will either require your Apple ID password for each paid download or after fifteen minutes of making your last purchases in the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store or Mac App Store, depending on your preference.
* What you cannot do on iOS and OS X is disable password prompts for both free and paid downloads. On the new Apple TV, however, it’s possible to turn off password protection for both free and paid items and this tutorial will help you do just that.
* Step 1: On your Apple TV, go to Settings → Accounts → iTunes and App Store → Password Settings.
* Step 2: In the section labeled Purchases And In-App Purchases choose the Require Password option.

* Step 3: Now set your preferred level of protection to Never. You can also choose to be reminded to Always enter password for purchases or After 15 Minutes.
* Step 4: Also select Require Password under the Free Downloads section and choose Never to turn off password prompts when downloading free apps from the App Store.

* Tip: If you set Require Password to Never in step 3, there won’t be an option to turn this setting on.
* Step 1: On your Apple TV, go to the Settings → iTunes Store → Sign In section and sign in with your Apple ID and password. If you already are signed in, sign out and then follow the steps in this section to change your password settings.
* Step 2: You should now see a screen that offers you to remember the password.
* Choosing “Yes” remembers the password for purchases as long as you’re signed in with your Apple ID. Setting your level of protection to “No” will require your password each time you purchase television shows or movies on the device.
* Though you can disable password prompts for free items in iOS and OS X, you cannot completely turn off password protection for paid downloads on these platforms.

* As a refresher, related password settings can be found on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch under Settings → App and iTunes Stores → Password Settings.
* If Touch ID is enabled for App Store purchases, you won’t see this menu so manage these features in Settings > General > Restrictions > Password Settings.
