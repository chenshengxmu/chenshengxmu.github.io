* According to research firm NPD Group, Apple has passed up Samsung and LG to become the #1 selling US handset brand in the fourth quarter of 2011. Between the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, the iPhone accounted for 43% of the US smartphone market, even though Android’s market share increased to 48%.
* Combined, iOS and Android devices accounted for over 90% of US sales, leaving Blackberry, Windows Phone and other mobile OSs under 10%.
* The NPD went on to say that 57% of first time US smartphone buyers go with an Android device, while only 34% of first time buyers purchased iPhones…
* That number is due most likely to Android having at least one handset on most major U.S Carriers, not to mention the sheer number of Android devices available.
* Out of the three iPhone models available, the iPhone 4S easily took the top spot as it was favored 5 to 1 despite the iPhone 4 cheaper price tag. Executive director of Connected Intelligence for The NPD Group, Ross Rubin said it was due to the newest iPhone’s “faster processor, improved camera and the Siri speech-driven agent.”
* What do you think of the iPhone’s jump? Are you shocked that price didn’t play a bigger part in choosing which iPhone to go with?
