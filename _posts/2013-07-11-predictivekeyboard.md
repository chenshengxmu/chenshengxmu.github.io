* PredictiveKeyboard is a recently released jailbreak tweak that allows you to use a SwiftKey inspired 5th row for predictive key entry. The tweak, which is available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $2.39, is capable of speeding up typing by remembering words and phrases. Want to see how PredictiveKeyboard works in action? Then check out our full video walkthrough after the break…
* Once installed, you’ll immediately notice a 5th row of keys above the stock keyboard’s QWERTY row. The predictive keys, which appear as a set of three different keys with full words, can be inserted with a single tap just like with a regular keyboard key. For often typed phrases, you’ll notice that PredictiveKeyboard will suggest words that come next in the phrase. As mentioned, PredictiveKeyboard will also remember new words.
* The preference panel for PredictiveKeyboard contains a kill switch, a dictionary selection, and the ability to clear out learned words. Extra dictionaries language packs can be downloaded free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* One downside to PredictiveKeyboard has to do with the tweak’s purchasing requirements. Instead of going the normal Cydia purchase route, the tweak is downloadable for free, but you must purchase a license separately from PayPal. While this works, it breaks up the smooth transaction process normally present with most jailbreak tweaks.
* I don’t type enough on my iPhone to warrant using PredictiveKeyboard on a regular basis, but if you use your iPhone to type more than short emails or text messages, then PredictiveKeyboard can be of assistance. What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.
