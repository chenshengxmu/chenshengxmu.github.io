* In line with all of the recent speculation regarding the rumored “iPad Mini,” one developer decided to see how such a device would stack up against other popular tablets.
* What you see above is a comparison between the screen sizes of various slates, including the Kindle Fire, the Nexus 7, the current iPad, and the purported iPad Mini…
* As you can see, the argument could be made that a 7.85-inch iPad would be much closer to an 8-inch tablet than a 7-inch one. And you can see the size difference in the graphic, which shows that a smaller iPad would still be almost 40% larger than both the Kindle Fire and the Nexus 7.
* It would certainly take some getting used to, but it seems like most apps would be fairly usable on an 8-inch display. Although, at that size, you have to imagine that Apple would pitch such a device more for content consumption, rather than creation. But that’s a whole different argument.
* If you want to see the 7.85-inch screen size in action, we ran a post earlier today showing you how to view app mockups on your current iPad to get an idea of what the smaller display would look and feel like.
* At this time, most of the “evidence” suggests that if we do see a smaller tablet from Apple this year, it’ll turn up sometime in the fall with a 1024 x 768 display and a price tag between $199 and $249.
* Would you buy one?
