* An Apple-designed ‘S2’ system-in-package that will power a second-generation Apple Watch won’t be produced by Samsung, like the original Apple Watch’s S1 chip. According to a new report by Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has managed to beat Samsung in securing S2 orders. In fact, both the second-generation Apple Watch and an enhanced version of the original Apple Watch will be driven by the S2 chip, built using TSMC’s 16-nanometer process technology.
* “TSMC will replace Samsung as the sole supplier of chips for the new Apple Watch starting the second half of 2016,” wrote DigiTimes, citing a report by Taiwan’s Central News Agency (CNA). The current S1 package that powers the Apple Watch is being built on Samsung’s 28-nanometer process technology.
* Producing the forthcoming S2 chip on TSMC’s more advanced 16-nanometer process will result in smaller transistors, thereby helping reduce the size of the chip, improve processing speed and make the wearable device more power efficient.
* The news came hot on the heels of a KGI Securities analysis by Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes there will be two models of Apple Watch slated for launch in the second half of 2016, with Samsung joining LG Display as a provider of AMOLED panels for the device in the second half of 2016.
* The analyst also predicted that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn will enter the supply chain for the Apple Watch starting 2017, joining existing supplier Quanta Computer.
