* I’m not sure why one would want to do that, but here is a friendly public service announcement to let you know that you can still downgrade to iOS 8.1.1 should you choose to. Following the release of iOS 8.1.2 yesterday, Apple still hasn’t closed the signing window of iOS 8.1.1, which means that if for some reason you have issues with iOS 8.1.2, you can still downgrade to iOS 8.1.1 and enjoy a stable jailbreak with TaiG. 
* As always when downgrading, time is of the essence as Apple could close the signing window at any time, making going back to a iOS 8.1.1 impossible.
* Again, I don’t think there is any compelling argument to downgrade to iOS 8.1.1, but at least you know it is possible.
* Step 1: Download the iOS 8.1.1 firmware for your device from our download page.
* Step 2: Plug your device to your computer via the USB cable. Hold the Alt/Option key (Shift key if you’re on Windows) while clicking on the Restore option in iTunes.
* Step 3: A window will pop up allowing you to choose the firmware you want to restore to. Choose the iOS 8.1.1 firmware you downloaded in step 1.
* Step 4: iTunes will downgrade your firmware back to iOS 8.1.1, assuming that iOS 8.1 is still being signed by Apple. If it’s not, you will receive an error message and the downgrade will halt.
