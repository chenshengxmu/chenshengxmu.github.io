* Just like they did with the first iPad, Apple is now coming up with a new case/cover concept for the iPad 2. Steve says it’s not a case, it’s more of a cover. It’s heard to tell exactly how it’s going to look and feel but looking at pictures of, it looks like a nice way to protect your device.
* A few magnets grasp and auto-align the cover on your iPad screen. It’s like a flap that covers the front of the device. It automatically wakes the iPad when you open it, and puts it to sleep when it closes it.
* Best of all, it comes with microfiber lining that cleans the screen for you. Brilliant!
* 10 different colors will be available: 5 in poly, 5 in leather. Poly will sell for $39 and leather covers will sell for $69.
