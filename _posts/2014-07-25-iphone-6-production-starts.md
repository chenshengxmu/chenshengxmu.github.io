* As the purported parts and cases thought to belong to the iPhone 6 continue leaking out, Apple is now said to have started mass production of a 4.7-inch handset variant. As for a bigger 5.5-inch version, the handset is understood to enter production in September, alongside upcoming new iPads.
* If true, there may after all be some truth to the rumors that the two phones won’t launch simultaneously in order to avoid cannibalization. Just yesterday, for instance, the hit-and-miss DigiTimes said the 4.7 and 5.5-inch models of the iPhone 6 will launch separately as Apple wants to “avoid competition between the two models”…
* GforGames writes, citing Chinese media reports [Google translate], that the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 variant “hasn’t entered its mass production stages just yet”, while manufacture of its 4.7-inch counterpart has reportedly started.
* Both the next iPad mini and the second-generation iPad Air will also enter mass production in September, the story has it.
* This confirms previous rumors and a recent Wall Street Journal article stating Apple is gearing up for a record production of 70 to 80 million iPhone 6 units this year.
* A look into Apple’s supply chain commitments made public in Apple’s recent SEC filing prove the firm is gearing up for a huge product launch this Fall. The chart below, via Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty and obtained by Business Insider, tells a very interesting story.

* According to Huberty, off-balance sheet commitments “confirm major product ramps later this year”. For those unfamiliar with off-balance sheet commitments, the term denotes prepayments for product components, money spent on factory tooling and machines, advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and so forth.
* Long story short, Apple’s total supply chain commitments at the end of the June quarter surged a massive 46 percent year-over-year to $15.4 billion, or 36 percent sequentially.

* The figure represents the highest annual growth since just before the iPhone 5 launched and the highest sequential growth for a June quarter since 2007 when Apple started selling the iPhone, says Huberty.
* Clearly, Apple is expecting a lot from the iPhone 6 launch this Fall. Moreover, the massive surge in capital expenditure on manufacturing equipment is a strong indicator of brand new product categories entering Apple’s supply chain (iWatch, anyone?)
* Here’s another chart on what Apple is up to, this one from Stifel (via Jay Yarow).

* As for the iPhone 6, the reports cited by GforGames claim that Apple’s supply chain is “currently facing yield issues, adding that the production capacity will increase by up to 80-85 percent in the fourth quarter thanks to “various upgrades” that Apple’s contract fabricator Foxconn has brought to its production lines.
* It’s been previously reported that Foxconn is preparing to deploy sophisticated robots to help assemble devices in its plants, though these Foxbots, as they’re called, will play more of a supporting role in factories.
* Looks like it’s going to be a busy Fall this year for Apple.
* What are your expectations?
