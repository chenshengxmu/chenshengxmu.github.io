* LEDAVANCE has released a few updates to their Sylvania Smart+ lineup of HomeKit-connected lights, including the launch of their first filament-style bulb.
* It started with a full-color bulb earlier this year, which we went hands-on with a review. As we mentioned, the biggest news is the launch of the stylish filament bulb.
* The Sylvania Smart+ Soft White A19 Filament Bulb puts out 650 lumens and 2700K light. If you’re looking for a comparison to a standard bulb, that would be a 40W equivalent.
* This is the first bulb of its type to be HomeKit-enabled.

* You may be familiar with filament bulbs as the stylish retro-looking bulbs that have been popularized recently. They give off traditionally lower light, but look very unique and stylish. Something that Sylvania’s lights have in common is that they work completely through Bluetooth and require no hub, bridge or Internet to operate.

* Like any other HomeKit connected light bulb, it works with other HomeKit products. And thanks to HomeKit, it can easily be automated and respond to Siri commands. To enable remote functionality, you still need a newer Apple TV or iPad running iOS 10 or later.
