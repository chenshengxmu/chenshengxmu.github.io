* OneNote’s revamped interface makes organizing your notes easier than before with an improved layout. You’ll notice that the reworked interface puts your content front and center, with all of the notebooks, sections and pages moved to columns on the left side of the app.
* This allows for efficient organization of your notebooks.
* The company celebrated the redesigned OneNote launch with the following video.
* The newly implemented accessibility features, available across iOS and macOS, let people with various disabilities efficiently navigate the app with screen readers, improved keyboard shortcuts and other assistive technologies.
* And with the left-hand navigation controls, screen readers can easily navigate through the app.
* OneNote is now available with a consistent experience across devices: with this update, says Microsoft, your experience will be the same regardless of what device you happen to be using.
* The new redesign for OneNote is rolling out for Windows 10, Mac, iOS, Android and on the web over the coming weeks so check back later if it’s not live yet.
* OneNote for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch is available free on App Store.
* OneNote for Mac is available free on Mac App Store.
