title: Rovio launches DreamWorks tie-in, The Croods
---
* As promised, Angry Birds maker Rovio on Thursday launched its brand new game for iOS and Android devices, The Croods. Basically a movie tie-in based on The Croods, the upcoming CG animated feature film by DreamWorks Animation, the game follows the movie storyline and features nice looking landscapes, a bunch of creatures and puzzles that will put your gray matter to the test…
* You’ll get to trap and tame ten crazy Stone Age creatures like the Girelephant or Molarbear, decorate the characters and homes in the pre-historic world “with the latest in caveman fashion accessories” and create interesting contraptions to open and explore new areas.
* Rovio’s blurb:
* Meet the world’s first modern family: The Croods! These cavemen are breaking out of the Stone Age with the use of a new revolutionary tool: the IDEA! The Croods will hunt & gather their way through spectacular new landscapes as they tame amazing new creatures.
* “Think you can catch them all?”, Rovio writes in an obvious nod at Pokémon.
* Should you get stuck dreaming up the various contraptions, you can ask the family patriarch, Grug, for help, he’ll be glad to assist you.
* A few screenshots.

* More screenies and downloads can be found at the game’s official web site.
* Here’s the movie trailer.
* The Croods, the animated move, premiers on March 22 in Real 3D and Digital 3D.
* The Croods is available for iOS and Android devices as a free-to-play download on both platforms. Some in-game items can be obtained through in-app purchases, which is obviously the way to go these days.
* The game contains third-party advertisement and supports GameCenter feature for achievements and leaderboards.
* Rovio previously released two rather successful movie tie-ins, Angry Birds Space and Angry Birds Rio.
* They also ventured into animated shorts themselves and will start airing these via Angry Birds apps this Sunday, in addition to select television channels and VoD platforms.
