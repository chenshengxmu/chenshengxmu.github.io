* Ukrainian developer Readdle has updated its free and paid Calendar apps for iOS with a refreshed user interface on the iPad sporting better layout and improved navigation. On the iPhone, the new Calendars 5.4 lets you set customer reminders and both editions include a pair of maintenance fixes and other improvements.
* Now available to download in the App Store, both the free Calendars app and the $2.99 premium Calendars have been updated with the aforementioned features…
* The new Calendars version 5.4 also offers Smart Input in French, Italian and Spanish and contains “lots of minor improvements.”
* If you love Readdle apps, you’ll want to download Printer Pro for iPhone which went free yesterday and immediately became #1 free download in 15 countries, according to Readdle on Twitter.
* Best thing you download the app right now as it’s set to go back up to its normal asking price of $4.99 tomorrow.
* The team also noted that PDF Expert’s iOS 7 style redesign is being developed as we speak. In addition to iOS 7 styling, the upcoming PDF Expert 5 will be a universal app with new features.
* Download the free Calendars 5 for iOS in the App Store.
* The premium edition of Calendars 5 will set you back $2.99.
* Both are universal and run natively on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad compatible with iOS 6.0 or later.
