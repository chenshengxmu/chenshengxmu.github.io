* Some of you with iPhone 3G who updated to iOS 4 and up have noticed how performances have been degraded. The most common symptom is how slow you iPhone 3G becomes. Apple recently said they are looking into it, and in the meanwhile, we provided you with a quick fix that works for many of you.
* A frustrated iPhone 3G user asked Steve Jobs about it:
* I’ve waited patiently through 4.0.1 and 4.0.2, looking for a fix that will make my phone work again. I’ve read the forums that advise me to jailbreak my phone or use some other method so I can downgrade back to a version of iPhone 3, however I’m not prepared to use a method that is not supported by Apple.
* To which Steve replied:
* Software update coming soon.
* Sent from my iPhone
* Here you go. This software update will probably come under the form of iOS 4.1. If I had a guess, I’d say we’ll see this update early September.
* Are you experiencing slow performances on your iPhone 3G?
