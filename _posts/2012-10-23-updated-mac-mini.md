* We’re about half an hour into Apple’s highly anticipated media event and even though there has been no iPad mini sighting yet, Apple has introduced a few new products. A few moments ago, it announced a new Retina display 13″ MacBook Pro, and now it’s talking about a new Mac mini…
* In what is probably the least exciting product announcement of the day, Apple has just unveiled an updated Mac mini. Although, Marketing SVP Phil Schiller did crack a funny joke: “Next, Mac mini. You knew there’d be something called mini in this presentation, didn’t you?”

* The new models are fairly similar to their predecessors, updated with new processors, and come in the familiar $599 and $799 configurations. And again, there’s a third $999 server model.
* Don’t get us wrong, this is a powerful little machine at these price points. But if you’re really looking for a new Mac desktop, you might want to check out Apple’s new ultra thin iMac.
