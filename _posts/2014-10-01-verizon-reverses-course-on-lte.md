* It looks like Verizon Wireless won’t be throttling the LTE speeds of remaining unlimited data customers after all. In a statement to The Verge this afternoon, the carrier says it has “decided not to move forward with the planned implementation of network optimization for 4G LTE customers on unlimited plans.”
* Verizon announced its plan to throttle LTE for select unlimited data customers in July, as part of its ‘network optimization’ strategy. The decision was met with a large amount of criticism from consumers, as well as FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who demanded further explanation for the move from the carrier.
* Why did it reverse its course? Here’s their full statement:
* Verizon is committed to providing its customers with an unparalleled mobile network experience. At a time of ever-increasing mobile broadband data usage, we not only take pride in the way we manage our network resources, but also take seriously our responsibility to deliver exceptional mobile service to every customer.
* We’ve greatly valued the ongoing dialogue over the past several months concerning network optimization and we’ve decided not to move forward with the planned implementation of network optimization for 4G LTE customers on unlimited plans. Exceptional network service will always be our priority and we remain committed to working closely with industry stakeholders to manage broadband issues so that American consumers get the world-class mobile service they expect and value.
* This comes as competition intensifies in the US carrier space. Seemingly kickstarted by T-Mobile’s ‘Uncarrier’ campaign, all four major wireless providers are now involved in a 1-up marketing game. Earlier today, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint announced that they would be doubling their data offerings for a limited time.
