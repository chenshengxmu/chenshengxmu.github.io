* Delivery times for iPhone X from Apple’s online stores have improved from 2-3 weeks about a month ago to 1-3 business days in the United Sates, Canada and other markets around the world.
* The reduced shipping times are now showing for Silver and Space Gray models, including SIM-free models, in both 32GB and 256GB capacities across all major carriers.
* If you order your iPhone X now, you’ll likely receive it before Friday, which is great considering the handset was originally supposed to be in short supply until early 2018.
* If you’re planning on buying an iPhone X, be sure to check stock using Apple.com or the Apple Store app every morning. Apple’s retail stores receive shipments every day so you’re wholeheartedly recommended to check out in-store pickup availability for your area.
* Alternatively, use the stock-tracking tool iStockNow to check iPhone X availability.
