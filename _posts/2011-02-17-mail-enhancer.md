* In itself, the iPhone’s email works fairly well. It’s simple, and reliable. In fact it’s almost too simple, being devoid of many customization options that you think would be a no-brainer.
* Mail Enhancer is a jailbreak tweak that aims to provide your iPhone’s email with some much needed depth in the way of customization.
* As you’ll see inside, it more than lives up to its name…
* Once you install Mail Enhancer, prepare to spend some significant time configuring it to your liking using the Settings.app.
* First there’s signatures, you can enable or disable custom signatures that support HTML. Not only that, but the tweak features the ability to have a different signature per email address.

* Mail Enhancer is smart enough that it automatically recognizes which email addresses you have configured on your iPhone, and will assign each signature accordingly.
* The second major way that Mail Enhancer spruces up your email is by way of custom notifications. These too can be enabled or disabled at the touch of a button.

* The custom notifications consist of vibrate, sound, speech, and popup. The ‘sound’ option is by far the most intriguing, as it allows you to assign iTunes ringtones as incoming mail notifications.
* To top all of that off, Mail Enhancer will even recognize HTML code placed into the body of your email, and prompt you on whether of not you wish convert that email to HTML format. Impressive.

* Really, I just touched upon the high level aspects of Mail Enhancer. This is an extremely deep tweak that could theoretically have you tinkering with its settings for hours on end.
* At its current price-point Mail Enhancer is a steal. It’s rare that a tweak comes along that offers such fine-grained control like this one does. Other developers should really take a page out of this tweak’s book when it comes to the amount of control that it lends the user.
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone, you can purchase Mail Enhancer on Cydia for $1.99.
* Have you tried it yet?
