* We knew China was the land of knockoffs and copycats. You can easily find an HiPhone 5, and the iPhone 5 hasn’t even come out yet. It now appears that you can also find lots of fake iPhone 4’s.
* The Chinese police busted a gang responsible for a “sophisticated” counterfeit iPhone ring. They came across a group of individuals who purchased various parts in China, and assembled the fake iPhones in their apartment…
* 200 real fake iPhones were found there, and according to the police, the fake models were identical to the real ones, except they had a shorter battery life. Even for an iPhone connoisseur, it’s hard to make the difference between a good fake and the real thing.
* The cost to make those fake iPhones was about $313. They were then sold online or to shops in China for twice the price.
* Do you think that you could tell the difference between a real and fake iPhone?
