* As part of its four-day weekend sale, Best Buy is offering some rather deep discounts on a range of Apple products, including the stainless steel Apple Watch, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Mac notebooks (including the latest-generation MacBook Air) and iMac desktops, Beats 1 headphones and more.
* Both 38mm and 42mm editions of the stainless steel Apple Watch can now be had with a cool discount of up to $200 and free shipping. The promotion brings the 38mm Apple Watch model with a Black Sport Band from its regular asking price of $540 down to just $349, the lowest price for that model we’ve seen.
* Also available discounted: the 38mm stainless steel Apple Watch with the Milanese Loop is now just $449 over at Best Buy versus its original asking price of$649.
* The pricier 42mm stainless steel Apple Watch models with a Milanese Loop or a Black Sport Band are currently $449 and $349, respectively, during Best Buy’s four-day sale. Over at Apple, these watches are respectively priced at $699 and $599.
* Or, how about a 2.7GHz 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, eight gigs of RAM and 128GB storage for $1,075, amounting to a savings of $225 based on the machine’s regular price of $1,299?
* Speaking of notebooks, Apple’s Certified Refurbished online store is offering previous-generation twelve-inch MacBook models starting at just $929 shipped.
* Other deals include a $199 iPad mini 2 (you save $70), a third-generation Apple TV for $50, up to $80 off select Beats 1 headphones and speakers and a savings of $75 on the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro models.
* Here are your shopping links:
* If you’re in the market for a Mac notebook and you don’t mind a non-Retina screen, Apple’s 11.6-inch 1.6GHz MacBook Air with four gigs of RAM and 256GB of flash storage is just $925 versus Apple’s price of $1,099.
* Bonus: save an additional $50 if you have an .edu email address.
