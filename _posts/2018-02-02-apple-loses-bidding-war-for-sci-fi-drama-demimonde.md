* Apple and HBO were allegedly embroiled in a bidding war over a promising new science-fiction drama television series by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” director J.J Abrams, and HBO has reportedly prevailed.
* The Hollywood Reporter says HBO’s won the bidding war for the show, named “Demimonde”.
* The series is about a mother who works as a scientist, her husband and their young daughter. After the family suffers a terrible car crash, the mother winds up in a coma. Meanwhile, the daughter begins digging through her experiments in the basement only to be transported to another land amid a world’s battle against an oppressive force.
* An episode count has not yet been determined.
* HBO is describing “Demimonde” as “an epic and intimate sci-fi fantasy drama.” Notably, Abrams is also executive producer for the network’s sci-fi western thriller series “Westworld.”
* According to the publication, the directory was impressed with what HBO did with “Westworld,” making the premium cable network the frontrunner for the series over deep-pocketed Apple.
* The series will be Abrams’ first TV writing gig since “Fringe” in 2008.
