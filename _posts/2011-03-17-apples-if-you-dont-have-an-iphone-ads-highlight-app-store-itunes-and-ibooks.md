* Apple has released some new ads that focus on the three main e-commerce stores for the iPhone. These short, 30 second promos focus on the App Store, iTunes, and iBooks.
* The main focus of these three ads is to show what people who don’t have the iPhone are missing. The “If you don’t have an iPhone” tag line plays throughout the ad as different features of each store are pointed out. Each ad ends with a little jab: “If you don’t have an iPhone, well, you don’t have an iPhone.”
* What do you think? The ads clearly get the intended message across. Perhaps a little too boldly? Apple sure knows how to make a poignant little commercial.
