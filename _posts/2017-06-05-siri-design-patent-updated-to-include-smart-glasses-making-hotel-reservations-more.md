* Apple’s Siri design patent in the European Union and Hong Kong has been updated ahead of today’s live-streamed WWDC keynote to also cover “smart glasses” as a category. As noted by PatentlyApple, the patent now lists “smart glasses” under the “remote control for” category.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo gave the rumored standalone Siri speaker a 70 percent chance of being formally unveiled during the keynote presentation, but he had nothing to say about any kind of Apple-branded smart glasses.
* A sketchy report that appeared on Reddit this weekend, attributed to an alleged Foxconn insider, leaked more info about the purported Google Glass-like augmented reality accessory.
* Apparently code-named “Project Mirrorshades,” the glasses are said to include polarized or prescription lens with smart optics from German maker Carl Zeiss, noise-cancelling microphones, a light sensor, bone-induction modules, an accelerometer sensor for tracking steps and head movement, magnetometer for navigation, a capacitive panel on one side, a ceramic battery, an Apple-designed chipset and more.
* The bone conducting modules would presumable allow for Siri command and hands-free phone calls, among other features. The poster mentions there’s a 65 percent chance that the project is cancelled so take the report with a pinch of salt.
* Another new entry covers making hotel reservations. Siri can currently make a reservation at a restaurant, but not a hotel. The Cupertino technology giant is expected to announce plans today to make Siri work with a larger variety of apps, Reuters reported yesterday.
* The updated patent is no guarantee that Siri could be used to control the rumored smart glasses or that Apple’s voice assistant could play a major role in its augmented reality plans.
* All shall be revealed in less than an hour and a half.
* Any predictions?
