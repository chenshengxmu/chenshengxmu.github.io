* Well that didn’t take long. Hot on the heels of iH8sn0w’s announcement earlier today that Siri wasn’t restricted to the A5 processor, we now have concrete evidence that the feature has been successfully ported to the iPhone 4.
* Apple’s popular personal assistant debuted on the iPhone 4S exclusively last week, and everyone has been raving about its potential. Now it appears that iPhone 4S owners won’t be the only ones getting in on the fun…
* 9to5Mac just published this video of a jailbroken iPhone 4 running the Siri voice command system. The site has been working with Steven Troughton-Smith, a developer, to port the feature to non-supported devices. And by the looks of it, they’re well on their way.
* As you can see, the Siri port is still immature at this point. Although it can recognize spoken commands and handle voice-to-text, it’s unable to pass commands on to Apple’s servers. It’s also running painfully slow, another side affect of the early port.
* The site claims that they are continuing to work on the system to improve its functionality. And even though it doesn’t appear to be usable just yet, this is great news for folks who didn’t rush out to grab Apple’s latest handset. So when can we download it from Cydia?
