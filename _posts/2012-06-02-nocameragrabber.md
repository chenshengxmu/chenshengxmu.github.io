* I’ve never been particularly fond of the new Lock screen camera “grabber” feature on iOS 5.1 and above, and frankly, I never find myself using it. In fact, I never used the camera shortcut that appeared with a double press of the Home button on firmware below iOS 5.1. Call me crazy, but I’m just not a big fan of using the camera directly from the Lock screen.
* NoCameraGrabber is a jailbreak tweak designed with people like me in mind. It completely removed the camera grabber feature from your iPhone’s Lock screen, and it doesn’t even bring up the camera button with a double press of the Home button. NoCameraGrabber is a great way to completely eliminate camera shortcut functionality from the Lock screen. Take a look at our video preview for more info…
* If you’re in the same boat as I am, and absolutely loathe Lock screen camera shortcuts, then I advise you to check out NoCameraGrabber. It’s a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and there are no options to configure.
* What about you? Do you like the Lock screen camera shortcuts, or not?
