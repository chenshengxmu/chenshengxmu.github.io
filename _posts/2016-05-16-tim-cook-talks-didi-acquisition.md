* Apple CEO Tim Cook visited an Apple Store in Beijing this morning with Liu Qing, president of Didi Chuxing, the company the iPhone maker invested an astounding $1 billion in.
* Also called the Chinese Uber, Didi is a ride sharing service and Apple’s investment comes at a time when the Cupertino firm is widely rumored to be secretly working on an electric car project. Cook said Apple and Didi both shared concerns for the environment.
* He also revealed, according to China Daily, that app developers in China have now earned over $7 billion, half of which came in the past twelve months alone.
* So, why has Apple poured a billion dollars into Didi?
* According to Cook, it’s because “Didi has a very great management team and its objective is also environmental, hoping to help reduce pollutions by making more efficient use of cars.”
* Speaking of Apple’s momentum in the 1.33 billion people market, Cook has revealed that “China-based developers have now earned over $7 billion, and what is more impressive, over half of that came in the past 12 months alone.”
* “The momentum is quite strong,” he said, promising to make more efforts in the marketing side to help Chinese developers go global.
* “The thing I like to do most in China is to spend time with entrepreneurs. There are so many entrepreneurs that are driving the next wave of innovations,” said the CEO.

* China, Apple’s second-largest market by revenue which has been making moves to strengthen domestic companies, is currently at odds with Apple.
* First, a Chinese court ruled that a local company is free to use the name “IPHONE” on its handbags and leather goods after Apple lost a trademark fight and then a state agency shut down the Chinese iBooks and iTunes Movies stores.
* It’s not clear if Cook will meet any state officials to discuss regulatory issues during this trip, but we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop.
* According to Fortune’s sources, Cook will be in India tomorrow.
