* If you’re planning on buying a brand spanking new iPhone 5c or treat yourself to one of the colorful new plastic iPhones, you’d be wise to consider Apple’s $99 AppleCare+ extended warranty coverage.
* Because, for all the talk of the iPhone 5c’s seamless hard-coated polycarbonate plastic shell (“you won’t see seams, or part lines, or joins,” Apple boasts; here’s how it’s made), the device is in fact prone to scratches and can be damaged.
* The problem is, AppleCare+ is only available in the United States, Canada and Japan. Well, not anymore. Today, the extended warranty coverage is available to customers in the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Learn more just after the break…
* The rumors came true: you can now pick up an extended AppleCare+ coverage plan for you device in the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The $99 a year plan costs €69 in France and Italy and £55 in the United Kingdom.
* The AppleCare+ warranty covers up to two incidents of accidental damage from handling of your device. However, whereas previously each incident would incur an additional $49 service fee (plus applicable tax), Apple appears to have increased the fee to $79 for up to two incidents, AppleInsider learned.

* Under the plan, Apple promises to provide repair or replacement coverage – both parts and labor – from its authorized technicians for AirPort, iPhone and iPad devices. The battery and the included USB cable and power adapter are also covered by the plan.
* Keep in mind that AppleCare+ must be purchased in the home country in which the device will be used. Apple’s standard warranty included with every iPhone purchase comes with 90 days of complimentary telephone support and one year of warranty coverage.
* If you’ve notice AppleCare+ has gone live in your country, please drop us a hint on tips@idownloadblog.com so we could update the article accordingly.
