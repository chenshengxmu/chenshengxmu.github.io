* One of the most innovative audio companies in the United States, Master & Dynamic, is out with its first pair of truly wireless earbuds, the all-new MW07s. Priced at $299, these AirPod competitors are available in four different colors and offer features that, at least on paper, make them worth considering.
* Launching today, Sept. 13, the MW07s have been designed for those who like to combine style with portability. On the one side, you’ve got premium materials and luxurious colorways. Each earbud is made of handcrafted acetate and stainless steel as well as 10mm Beryllium drivers. They are available in Tortoiseshell, Steel Blue, Grey Terrazzo, and Matte Black.
* To gain its street credentials, each pair lasts up to 3 1/2 hours between charges with the hand-polished stainless-steel charging case adding an additional 10 1/2 hours of listening time. Best of all, the MW07s can gain a 50 percent charge is just 15 minutes, and a full charge in 40 minutes using the included USB-C cable.
* Other MW07 features include Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity, a MEMS, omnidirectional microphone, and optical sensors that detect in-ear placement for automatic playing/pausing. Additionally, MW07s are rated IPX 4, making them splash proof, and ship with detachable silicone “fit wing,” which come in two sizes, along with five ear tip sizes.

* As a long-time Master & Dynamic fan, I can’t wait to check out my MW07 review unit and let you know what I think. My full review will arrive in the coming weeks.
