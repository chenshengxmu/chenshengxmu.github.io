* Spotify is one of the most popular cross-platform streaming music services, with over 40 million active users worldwide. While I am out of luck using the service as a Canadian, our neighbors to the south and elsewhere can benefit from a jailbreak tweak called DefaultSpot. The simple iOS extension sets Spotify as the default music player on iPhone, and also integrates with the Control Center playback controls… 
* I decided to give DefaultSpot a test by signing in to my Apple ID for the United States, downloading Spotify and creating an account. After toggling on the tweak through the Settings app and respringing my iPhone, it worked just as advertised. When the stock Music app is not in use, tapping on the play button or other music controls in Control Center or other areas causes the Spotify app to open for listening to streaming music.

* DefaultSpot is a free download on Cydia in the default BigBoss repository, and it must be enabled through the Settings menu after installation. The tweak, developed by Ron Thakrar, is compatible with iOS 7 and 64-bit devices. It can be combined with the Controls for Spotify package to enable auto-resume on launching Spotify. That feature must be toggled through the Settings menu as well.
* Our own Jeff Benjamin previously reviewed Controls for Spotify, which is also developed by Thakrar. The tweak enhances your Spotify controls with Activator actions for shuffle, repeat, thumbs up, thumbs down, star, star and thumbs up, and copy playing URL. It allows you to set two-finger gestures from the bottom of the screen, left, right, top or elsewhere to gain better control over the streaming music app.
