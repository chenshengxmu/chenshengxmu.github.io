* We knew it was going to come at some point during the month of November, but we didn’t know when Apple was going to officially start selling the unlocked iPhone 4S in the United States. Turns out, it was today.
* With Apple already selling unlocked handsets on other countries, this is bringing the United States into line with everyone else. But if you’ve been waiting for the chance to buy an iPhone 4S without a 2-year contract, well, now you can!
* All three capacities are available, along with both white and black models…
* There is a price to pay for not being tied to a contract, and that’s a significant upfront cost. On Apple.com right now, the unlocked 16GB iPhone 4S will set you back $649. 32GB models weigh in at $749, with $849 required to pick up the top 64GB varient.
* Apple also notes that the unlocked handsets will not work with CDMA carriers, meaning Sprint and Verizon in the United States.
* “The unlocked iPhone includes all the features of iPhone but without a contract commitment. You can activate and use it on the supported GSM wireless network of your choice, such as AT&T in the United States.* The unlocked iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S will not work with CDMA-based carriers such as Verizon Wireless or Sprint.”
* If unlocked is your preferred route, you’ll also need to wait 1-2 weeks for delivery, according to the Apple Store.
* Who’s buying?
