* NotifyMusic is a new free jailbreak tweak by gilshahar7 that will present you with a banner notification any time a currently playing song on the device changes.
* The banner shows common metadata about the song, including the name of the song, the artist, and even a small preview of the album artwork; it also shows you what app is playing the media.
* For someone who listens to a lot of music, such as via online streamed radio stations, the tweak can be useful. The moment you hear a tune that you aren’t familiar with but like, you will get to see information about it front and center, almost like an instant “Shazam” effect.
* On the other hand, that’s not the only use for the tweak. Even if you’re listening from your own local playlists and song libraries and know your music by heart, the tweak has the potential to simply give you a nice aesthetic any time your music changes.
* You will notice that it works perfectly with all forms of media, including music that you play from the stock Music app, or from music that you’re playing from third-party music apps, such as Spotify Music for example.
* Speaking of the stock Music app, check out our video illustrating 12 of the newest features in the iOS 10 Music app:

* The tweak has no options to configure, so after installation, you will immediately start seeing these notification banners when songs change; there’s not much else to it.
* If you’re interested in trying NotifyMusic, you can pick the tweak up for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works great with jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* It’s also worth mentioning that the tweak is open source, so if you’re interested in seeing the source code that makes the tweak tick, you can check out the programming behind it on GitHub.
