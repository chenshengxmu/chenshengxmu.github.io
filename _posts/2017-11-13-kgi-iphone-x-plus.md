* Apple is predicted to release a Plus version of iPhone X next year featuring an OLED panel measuring 6.5 inches diagonally versus the current 5.8-inch iPhone X model.
* Additionally, it could be working on a bezel-less 6.1-inch LCD phone for a 2018 launch.
* Presumably, the new iPhone X Plus model would have roughly the same dimensions as today’s Plus-series phones whilst adding an edge-to-edge OLED display. As for the new 6.1-inch LCD-based model, it should feature greatly reduced bezels thanks to the elimination of Touch ID.
* Best of all, the new LCD model will offer features like the TrueDepth camera at a cheaper price.

* That’s the gist of the latest analyst report from KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo, who said in a Monday report to clients obtained by MacRumors that both OLED and LCD iPhone models released in 2018 will utilize the TrueDepth camera system which made its debut in iPhone X.
* We believe the major hardware difference in the two new OLED models is size, in a bid to satisfy various needs of the high-end market. The new TFT-LCD model will differ significantly from the OLED models in hardware and design specifications.
* For instance, the pixel density will be lower.
* The primary selling points of the TFT-LCD model may be the innovative user experience of an integrated full-screen design and 3D sensing with a lower price tag (we expect it will likely be US$649-749).
* With the updated 5.8-inch iPhone X model and the new 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus, Apple should continue targeting the high-end market while the bezel-less 6.1-inch TFT-LCD model will be aimed at the low-end and midrange markets.

* Due to these new phones coming next year, Kuo expects that Apple will see a “super-cycle” of sales as its suppliers gain experience in terms of volume manufacturing of the new technologies introduced in iPhone X.
* The analyst expects about 120 million total iPhone shipments in the second half of next year.
