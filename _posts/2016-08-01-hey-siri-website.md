* As Apple continues perfecting Siri and adding new operations to her arsenal of supported actions, chronicling everything the digital personal assistant can do on your behalf is becoming increasingly difficult, even for Apple itself which highlights only the most popular Siri queries on its website.
* That’s where a new website, aptly named Hey Siri, jumps in. As first discovered by The Loop, it’s a comprehensive list of things you can do with Siri which uses crowdsourced data to share some of the most successful queries made to the digital assistant.
* With a total of 35 different categories of questions listed, this is a great resource for everyone wishing to get the most out of Siri. For example, there are categories dedicated to device settings and email operations, those that explain how to message people, convert units, perform simple math and a bunch of others.
* You can find specific phrases using the search field at the top. In some cases, you can also change some of the highlighted words in the phrase, depending on context.
* At the time of this writing, the website reported listing a total of 439 commands and 1,104 different variations across 35 categories and in two languages.
* Check it out at hey-siri.io and let us know what you think in the comment section.
* Oh, and bookmark and share with others, please.
