* Apple may have a slight market share problem in BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China), but over in Japan the company has moved the needle in a big way. According to Hong Kong-based market research firm Counterpoint Research, Apple for the first time ended Sharp’s six-year run at the top to became the first non-Japanese company to rule the Japanese mobile phone market with a fifteen percent share in 2012, a notable increase from its ten percent market share in 2011…
* Apple has been No.1 since November of last year.
* As reported by Yonhap News, South Korea’s largest news agency, market positions of some well-known incumbents has dropped while Apple’s has risen.
* For example, Sharp’s share fell from eighteen percent in 2011 to fourteen percent in 2012, a four percentage points decrease. Fujitsu also dropped to a fourteen percent share in 2012.
* Interestingly enough, Apple’s fierce rival in the mobile space, Samsung Electronics, ranked fourth with an eight percent share. NEC, Sony and LG Electronics trailed behind, Yonhap reports.

* Per Counterpoint Research, the combined market share of foreign brands in the fourth quarter of 2012 surpassed half the country’s mobile phone market for the first time.
* In 2012 both Softbank and KDDI heavily promoted the new iPhone 5 to challenge Docomo. This move sparked a battle of smartphones in which Docomo fought back with various new smartphone models, the majority of which were also foreign branded.
* So yet again it’s operator competition that has catalyzed the iPhone’s success – but in Japan at the expense of home grown players.
* Apple is also prepping to put paid-for books from local publishers on the iBookstore. Japan’s carrier NTT DoCoMo hinted that an iPhone deal is in the works, though nothing has been announced yet.
* Although the Apple handset fares well in the 128 million people market, a survey of 2,400 consumer electronics stores in Japan throughout the month of December conducted by BCN shows that Google’s Nexus 7 tablet outsold the iPad during the period, for the first time since 2010.
