* Yet another of the 200+ new features in iOS 5. This one is hardly noticeable and won’t be life changing, but it’s still interesting to see how Apple is continually improving every app.
* This new feature can be spotted in Apple’s stock weather application. When double tapping on the screen, it now brings a break down hour by hour of the weather and temperature in the selected city…
* Again, not a life changing feature, but a nice little addition.
* Make sure to check our complete iOS 5 coverage. If you discover something interesting, send it our way.
