* Hopefully, you’ve followed along the announcements Apple made during its WWDC keynote that we’ve covered here at iDownloadBlog, but the whole event is so much better than the summaries provided by blogs. Apple has of course provided a live stream of today’s event. If you missed it, a replay stream went live at Apple.com – remarkably enough, just minutes after the keynote has wrapped up.
* Yup, now everyone can witness Apple’s boss Tim Cook take slow talking to the next level, laugh at the geeky jokes software engineering boss Craig Federighi cracked on stage (choice quote: OS X Weed) and basically see for themselves why Apple totally killed it today…
* You can stream the keynote straight from Apple’s website here. The video runs one hour and 58 minutes long and is well worth a watch.
* Note that streaming video requires Safari 4 or later on OS X v10.6 or later; Safari on iOS 4.2 or later; or QuickTime 7 on Windows. Streaming via the Apple Events channel on an Apple TV requires the second or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.
* Although Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre did not make appearances as previously suspected, Craig Federighi (Apple’s SVP of Software Engineering) in showcasing the new Continuity feature placed a phone call to Dr. Dre using his Mac.
* Ever since the firing of former iOS boss Scott Forstall, Apple’s mantra has been that of tight collaboration at the executive level.
* Nowhere was this been more evidently on display than at today’s keynote: you can tell that members of the leadership team like each other.
* The keynote video should pop up on Apple’s YouTube channel later.
* We’re also expecting a downloadable video soon on iTunes, via the official Apple Keynotes (1080p), Apple Keynotes HD and Apple Keynotes podcast channels.
