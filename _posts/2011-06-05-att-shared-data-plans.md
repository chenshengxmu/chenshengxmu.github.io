* Another interesting tidbit was unveiled by AT&T Mobility CEO, Ralph de la Vega, concerning the company’s future strategy for data plans. Instead of having to buy a separate data plan for each wireless device, such as an iPhone and iPad 3G, customers will be able to purchase a “shared data plan” that could be used across all registered devices.
* After receiving a lot of criticism over the network’s poor reliability and quality, AT&T is trying to adapt and build a better infrastructure for the largest group of smartphone customers in the U.S. These shared data plans look to be part of the plan for creating a better AT&T…
* Engadget,
* “AT&T CEO Ralph de la Vega just confirmed at the D9 conference today that the carrier is “working on” a shared data plan, but he’s not committing to a time frame just yet. He also left no doubts about those plans when pressed further on the question, clearly opening the door to a situation where you could have an iPad, an Atrix 4G, an AT&T netbook and just about anything else all sharing a unified pool of minutes and data. He didn’t offer any hints about possible pricing, though, and it certainly sounds like this is something that’s still a ways out from actually being launched.”
* It’s clear that this feature is still very much in the development stages, but it suggests some interesting change-ups to the traditional wireless plans that are offered today.
* For families with multiple iPhones or even different smartphones on the same family plan, shared data plans could be a much cheaper and more practical solution than the current, a la carte system. These types of shared plans could also make more sense for tethering users that wish to share data with multiple devices and save money.
* What do you think? Would you buy a shared data plan if you had the option?
