* A year ago, screenshots and information leaked concerning Apple’s dedicated iPhone app designed to consolidate users’ support, repair and troubleshooting needs in the palm of their hand. Last evening, a brand new Apple Support app launched on the App Store in The Netherlands ahead of its presumed staggered rollout around the world.
* With it, owners of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices can explore their support options, schedule repair appointments, manage AppleCare services and more.
* “Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple,” writes Apple in release notes accompanying the 95.2-megabyte download.
* The app also provides another way to find answers with support articles tailored to a user’s products and questions, with the ability to call, chat or email with an expert right away, book an appointment with a Genius at your nearby Apple Store and more.
* The app lists all of the devices registered to your Apple ID, giving you a range of pre-defined common problems for each device type.
* For the most part, the app provides the same options as Apple’s dedicated Support website. At any rate, it’s nice that users now have Apple’s support options readily available within a native iOS app.
* Grab Apple Support for free from the Dutch App Store.
