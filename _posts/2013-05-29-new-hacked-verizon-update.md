* Over the past month or so, we’ve seen hacked carrier updates released for both T-Mobile and AT&T. The modded firmware files were posted with the promise of improving data speeds in iPhones, and iPads with built-in cellular capabilities.
* Not wanting to leave the folks on ol’ Big Red out, the developer of those two hacks has posted a hacked carrier update for Verizon. And like the others, it promises to better device performance on the network by opening up its bandwidth…
* Here’s a technical explanation of how the hacked carrier update works:
* “This hack enables 1x Advanced and EVDO Rev. B on the iPhone 5 and iPad 3, 4, and mini as well as enhancing LTE data speeds. Though Verizon is limited to EVDO Rev. A, the device itself becomes more open to an increased amount of bandwidth thus allowing for better throughput of data and data connection. Throttling code was put in place to limit users to a certain amount of bandwidth on 3G and LTE but will now have a better opportunity for some faster speeds. This won’t increase signal so don’t expect it to like the AT&T version of this hack.”
* Of course, there’s no guarantees it will work for everyone. The developer says that your level of success with the hack greatly depends on where you are located. Things like population density and wireless traffic all play a factor into your results.
* “This hack does NOT guarantee that you will see any dramatic changes or any change at all as certain areas are simply limited because of population density, natural features that degrade signal, the traffic on a specific tower, and even the amount of spectrum the tower is limited to as not all LTE towers have been upgraded to 10MHz or more for higher bandwidth support. If you feel this hack has not helped you, we have provided a way back to defaults, if you choose to do so.”
* Those wanting to try out the hack can find step-by-step directions. The tutorial is entitled ‘Verizon Hacked Carrier Update for iPhone and iPad,’ and it works with the iPhone 5 and both standard and mini iPads with built-in cellular.
* We haven’t tried this ourselves yet, so I can’t speak to its effectiveness. But I do know that a lot of our readers reported improved network performance after installing the hacked AT&T update, so it might be worth trying if you’re craving more speed.
