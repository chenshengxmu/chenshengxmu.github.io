* If purported iPhone 6 schematics that leaked out of China Thursday are anything to go by, there may be truth to the rumor that the next iPhone(s) will double storage capacity by introducing a new model with 128 gigabytes of NAND flash storage.
* The rumor first appeared two months ago, suggesting that Apple would keep the 128GB option exclusive to the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 model along with other premium features (and possibly a premium pricing).
* This time around, there’s some hard (dubious?) evidence to back up the claim…
* The images below were shared by phone repair firm GeekBar on Weibo [Google Translate] and reposted by GforGames, which claimed Thursday that the flagship iPhone 6 model has 128GB of storage.

* Strangely enough, though the 32GB tier seems to be missing in action.
* GforGames writes:
* According to this new data, the iPhone 6 will be offered in 16, 64 and 128 GB flavors. The 16 GB memory will be provided by Toshiba and Hynix; the 64 GB memory will be supplied by Hynix, Toshiba, and SanDisk; while the beefier 128 GB units will allegedly be delivered by Toshiba alone.
* If anything, the rumored 128GB model would bring the iPhone on par with the iPad which in February of 2013 introduced a 128GB tier to the mix.

* Earlier this month, a 128GB iPhone SKU which reportedly surfaced in a German retailer’s system seemingly suggested that KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo’s belief that the flagship model would include 128 gigabytes of built-in storage could be warranted.
* Does an iPhone with 128 gigs of on-board storage sound appealing to you?
* And if so, would you buy one or opt for a 16/32/64GB model instead?
