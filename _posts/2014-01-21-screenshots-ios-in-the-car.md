* Developer Steven Troughton-Smith posted several images on Twitter this afternoon of what looks like Apple’s iOS in the Car project. The screenshots don’t show the entirety of the feature, but if legit, they do offer some insight on what the Maps app will look like when in use.
* For those unfamiliar with iOS in the Car, it’s an interface that deepens the integration between iOS devices and cars far beyond playing music. First introduced at WWDC, the feature will allow users to view and manage many iOS applications using their in-vehicle hardware…

* Troughton-Smith didn’t give any indication as to where he obtained the images, but it’s possible they were bundled in with the just-released version of iOS 7.1 or an earlier beta. The feature is expected to be one of the many changes and improvements made in the next iOS update.
* Also worth noting is how different these screenshots look compared to the ones Apple showed off last summer, or even those on the company’s website right now. So it’s unclear if this iteration is set to be the final release version, or if it’s a barebones interface built for testing purposes.

* Tim Cook has stressed the significance of iOS in the Car in the past, calling it a “key focus” and an “important part” of Apple’s ecosystem. And many automakers have pledged to support the new feature in future car models with custom hardware including Audi, Honda, Acura and BMW.
* Apple’s website lists iOS in the Car as ‘Coming soon.’
