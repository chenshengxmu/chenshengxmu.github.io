* Earlier we posted an article about NCQuickDismiss, a jailbreak tweak for iOS 5 that makes it easy to dismiss banner notifications with a tap.
* But did you know that you could dismiss banner notifications with a simple swipe, and you don’t even have to be jailbroken to do it?
* Check inside for the video evidence…
* Let me just state that I didn’t figure this out on my own. Actually, Chris Herbert from MacStories sent me a tweet informing me of this nifty little trick after he read the NCQuickDismiss article.
* While there have been mixed reports regarding the actual success of the swipe to dismiss, the video is clear evidence that it does work. I’ve also asked multiple iDB staffers to corroborate, and they confirm that it works as well.
* Now the question remains, does it work for you?
