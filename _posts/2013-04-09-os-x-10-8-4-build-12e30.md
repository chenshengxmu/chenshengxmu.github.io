* If you’re a registered OS X developer, you may be interested in this news. Just a week after Apple seeded the 12E27 beta build of OS X 10.8.4, it seeded this new build — dubbed 12E30. As with the previous build, Apple is asking developers to focus on specific areas of the OS, namely Wi-Fi, Graphics Drivers and Safari.
* Registered developers can head right on over to Apple’s developer portal and get downloading.
