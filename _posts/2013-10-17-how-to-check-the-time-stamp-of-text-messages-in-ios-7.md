* I don’t always have my iPhone sitting right next to me. Even when I do, sometimes I am at a show where the music is so loud I wouldn’t even notice a vibration if someone sent me a text. When that does happen, it always irritated me that Apple didn’t include the time that the message was sent. If a friend wanted to meet me outside in 10 minutes, I wouldn’t know when that would be.
* Starting with iOS 7, Apple has added the ability to see the time stamp of every message sent and received through iMessage or regular text. It is not obvious to everyone, but we know how to access it and have a quick tutorial to explain it to you…
* Before iOS 7, messages would only have random time stamps. In any given conversation, you might receive a time stamp at the start of a conversation and another one a few minutes later, or you might not receive one for days. You may have missed a text that was two minutes old, or four hours old. It was impossible to tell.
* Since iOS 7, you can now access the time stamp for every single iMessage or text message with a simple trick.

* When you open a text conversation, simply swipe to the left. That’s right. All you have to do is touch the screen and drag your finger from right to left. When you do, you will see a time stamp for every single message sent and received on the right side of the screen. Hold your finger on the screen to keep reading. Let go when you are done.
* It’s that simple. Now, you will never be confused when your friend sends you a text that reads, “Meet me in 15 minutes,” but you didn’t see the message right away. Finding out where you are supposed to meet is a whole different story.
* Have you ever wished you could see the time stamp for your messages? Have you tried this trick already? Isn’t it great?
