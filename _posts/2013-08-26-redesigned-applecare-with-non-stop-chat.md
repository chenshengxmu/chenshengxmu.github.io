* Earlier this month a reliable blogger asserted Apple would be making changes to its support website. The new experience was to be focused on a simpler and cleaner design that’s iOS-friendly so customers could access the many support materials and browse the various sections comfortably from their iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Sure enough, and right on cue, Apple this morning has started rolling out a redesigned Apple Support website with non-stop live chat support.
* The redesign calls for large thumbnails providing easy access to the product hubs, such as Macs, iTunes, iPods, iPhones, iPads and more, with each section containing a wealth of related support materials, like downloads, manuals, frequently asked questions and lots more…
* According to 9to5Mac, the prettified Apple Support pages now prominently advertise 24/7 chat support, which gives customers the ability to chat with a live agent, using an iOS-friendly web interface.
* Web chat was previously there, but you couldn’t chat with a live agent at any time of day or night. Besides, Apple did a stellar job of hiding the feature so it couldn’t be accessed until all other support venues have been fully explored.
* As you can see on the below screenie, live chat is now readily accessible via the redesigned Contact Apple Support link.

* 9to5Mac explains:
* On the topic of live chat support, we’re told that 24/7 chat support has begun rolling out. Initially, the support was limited to certain hardware and software, but now Apple is supporting both Mac and iOS Device support at every hour of the day and night.
* Furthermore, each support section is product-specific and only contains links and materials pertaining to your gadget. For example, here’s what the revamped landing page for the iPhone support looks like.

* Not everyone may be seeing the new UI as these things take time to propagate so give it a while and then try again if you’re stuck with the old interface.
* I’m liking the new UI a lot and think it was a high time Apple did something about the mess that was Apple Support on the web. The company is also said to be rolling out the rumored iPhone trade-in program next month to incentivize users into replacing their old handsets and upgrade to the latest and greatest iPhone.
* Along the same lines, Apple actually started repairing faulty iOS devices back in June and as of recently offers in-store $149 replacement screens for the iPhone 5.
* Finally, as part of its blockbuster Fall the company is expected to make rather substantial changes to AppleCare policies, switching from a one-time payment to a subscription-based model. As part of the change, Apple is said to be soon attaching the warranty to the customer rather than a particular device.
