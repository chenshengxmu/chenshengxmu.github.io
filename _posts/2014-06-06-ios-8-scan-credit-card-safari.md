* As folks continue to comb through the recently released iOS 8 beta, a new feature has been discovered in mobile Safari. When the updated browser detects a credit card field within a webpage, it offers to let the user scan their card with their device’s camera.
* Scanning your credit card automatically enters its information in the appropriate text fields, saving you from having to enter it manually. It takes just a moment, and it doesn’t appear that websites will have to do anything special to enable the new feature…
* As you can see, the process works a lot like Apple’s iTunes gift card scanning: you just have to position your card within the frame, and let the software do its thing. In my tests, Safari auto-filled the number in for me, but it didn’t do my name or expiration date.
* With a little tuning, this could help you save considerable time as you make online purchases—something Apple users seem to be doing a lot of. Of course, you can still have Safari save and auto-fill in your details for you, but not everyone likes storing that info.
* iOS 8 offers up a number of new features, which you can read about here, and is expected to be released to the public sometime this fall.
