* Following claims by ReCode’s well-informed John Paczkowski that Apple’s been prepping to hold an iPad-focused media event on October 16, the Cupertino company on Wednesday morning confirmed the report by issuing invites to select members of the press, The Loop first reported.
* Featuring a colorful Apple logo outline adorned by the the tagline “It’s been way too long,“ the invite prompts the media to attend the event which begins at 10:00am Pacific / 1pm Eastern at the firm’s Town Hall Auditorium in Cupertino, California.

* The media conference is widely expected to serve as a launchpad for new iPads, namely the second-generation iPad Air with Touch ID fingerprint scanning.
* We’re also expecting the public release of OS X Yosemite and maybe even an Apple TV hardware refresh and a few additional goodies, such as a Retina-enabled 12-inch MacBook Air in Space Gray, Silver and Gold, a brand new “5K” Thunderbolt Display and Retina iMacs.
* The iPod lineup — especially the iPod touch — is ripe for refresh, too. Note that the beleaguered iPod classic got phased out ahead of the iPhone 6 keynote.
* Given the steady decline in iPod sales ever since the original iPhone was introduced, it’s entirely conceivable that Apple might even opt to exit the standalone MP3 player market altogether.
* In terms of the iPad Air 2, we’re expecting a number of rumored features including a new speaker grille design, a relocated microphone, a brand new anti-reflective screen coating, Touch ID, an in-house designed A8, or an improved A8X chip, possibly with 2GB of RAM for the rumored split-screen multitasking function.
* There should be a gold colorway, too. The device isn’t expected to feature NFC, meaning Apple’s upcoming mobile payments solution, Apple Pay, could only be supported for online payments on the tablet.
* Earlier today, Vietnamese blog Tinhte.vn posted a series of images depicting what appears to be a prototype chassis or a dummy unit for the iPad Air 2.

* The photos show the Touch ID sensor on a thinner device and no mute switch on the side.

* The device is said to measure just 7 millimeters thick. By comparison, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are 6.9mm and 7.1mm thin, respectively, and the iPhone 5s measures 7.6mm in depth.
* Stay tuned as iDownloadBlog will be providing 24/7 coverage of the event to bring you all the news as it happens. Let the guessing game begin — feel free to share your expectations with fellow readers down in the comments.
