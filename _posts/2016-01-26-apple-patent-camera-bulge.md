* Apple has just been granted a very cool patent that promises to solve the protruding camera lens on the back of the iPhone 6/6s series. The invention basically calls for packing a spherical photosensor and lens array in a tiny package.
* The patent No. 9,244,253 for a “Small form factor high-resolution camera,” which was published Tuesday by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reduces the distance between the CMOS sensor and the lens by making the sensor curved, a technique used in astronomical telescopes and instrumentation.
* Effective focal length of the lens system is within about 20 percent of the radius of curvature of the photosensor. The camera is diffraction-limited with small spot size, allowing small pixels to be used in the photosensor.
* “An image is formed by the lens system at a spherically curved image plane that substantially matches the concave surface of the photosensor,” writes Apple.

* It’s important to note that Apple proposes using an additional lens positioned between the second lens element and the photosensor in order to cancel out chromatic aberration which occurs when a spherically curved lens fails to focus all colors to the same convergence point.
* Total axial length of the camera outlined by Apple’s patents promises to be a mere 2.0 mm or even less. Despite being implemented in a very small package size, the camera can capture sharp, high-resolution images, making it suitable for use in small devices.
* The patent was first filed for in 2013 and credits Apple engineers Xi Chen, David Gere and Matthew Waldon as its inventors.
