* We now know nearly one out of each three iOS users has upgraded to iOS 7 in the first sixteen hours of its availability. Have you? We’re only asking you to tell us whether or not you upgraded by now, in order to get a better understanding of the iOS 7 adoption rates thus far.
* This being a non-scientific YES/NO poll means readers who haven’t upgraded yet but are planning to should of course vote with a ‘no’…
* Cast your vote now.
* Have you upgraded to iOS 7 yet?
* If you’re still sitting on the fence, tell us why down in the comments.
* We also ran two other polls following the September 10 double iPhone keynote, one asking whether you’ll be buying a new iPhone – with half of the respondents voting ‘yes’ – and the other dealing with the iPhone 5C colors.
* The latter revealed an interesting preference among those iDB readers who participated in the poll: blue seems to be the favorite pick for more than one-third of respondents and pink expectedly turned out to be the least popular color with our (mostly male) readership.
