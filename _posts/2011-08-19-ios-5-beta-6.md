* Apple has released iOS 5 Beta 6 to developers, with the public launch of iOS 5 and iCloud predicted to happen in the next 1-2 months. Additionally, Apple has also released iTunes 10.5 Beta 6, Xcode 4.2 Preview 6, and a new Apple TV beta in its dev channel.
* Apple hasn’t reached the Beta 6 level for iOS in years, which reflects that fact that 2011 has been a very different year for the Cupertino company. The final GM build of iOS 5 before its public launch will most likely be the next download available to developers in the coming weeks.
* In the newest beta, OTA updates seem to be working for those already on iOS 5 Beta 5.
* Happy downloading! If you find anything interesting in iOS 5 Beta 6, tip us.
* UPDATE: You can see what’s new in Beta 6 here.
