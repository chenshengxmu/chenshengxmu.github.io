* Apple’s recently acquired Beats Music has posted a new video on its YouTube channel this evening. The 22-minute-long clip is called ‘Do The Right Thing 25 Year Anniversary: A Beats Music Experience,’ and it’s a documentary that revisits the cast and location of Spike Lee’s popular film.
* As the name suggests, the video celebrates the 25th anniversary of ‘Do The Right Thing,’ a 1989 film about the consequences of hate and bigotry in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York. The movie was controversial, but received critical acclaim and a number of major awards…

* The documentary follows Lee and other cast and crew members around the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood as they provide behind-the-scenes commentary. It also features interposed cutscenes from the original film, showing what things have changed in the area, and what remains the same.
* While it might seem odd to some, Variety points out the video is not merely a celebration of the movie but is also a vehicle for Beats Music to expand its brand. This is the kind of out-of-box marketing that Beats is known for, and reportedly one of the many things that led Apple to purchase it.
* Apple announced in May that it would be acquiring Beats Electronics for $3 billion, and the deal officially closed earlier this month.
