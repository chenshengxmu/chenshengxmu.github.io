* Apple has seeded the third beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 this morning. The update, labeled build 14C81f, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Dev Center for all registered Mac developers.
* Today’s release comes just over a week after the second 10.10.2 beta, and Apple has once again asked developers to focus their testing on Wi-Fi connectivity—a long-standing Yosemite issue—as well as Mail and VoiceOver.
* Given that this is a minor update, we don’t expect to see anything outside of bug fixes. But we’re installing the beta now, and will pass along anything of note. If you find something, e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com
