* Although it’s not as obvious and as straightforward as it is on the iPhone, it’s still possible to force close an app on the Apple Watch. Generally speaking, you shouldn’t need to force close apps, but every now and then, an app can get wacky to the point where a force close is necessary. In this post, we’ll show you how easy it is to force close any Apple Watch app at any time.
* Step 1: Open the app that you wish to close
* Step 2: Press and hold the side button until the power down menu appears and release the side button
* Step 3: Press and hold the side button again until the app disappears and you’re taken back to the Apple Watch Home screen
* As stated, you generally should not have to force close any app on the Apple Watch, because iOS, which Watch OS is based on, has pretty good app and memory management, and will allocate resources to apps that need them.
