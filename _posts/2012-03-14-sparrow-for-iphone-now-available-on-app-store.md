* Sparrow was once only a popular Mac app, but the developers soon teased the iPhone app. Excitement for the app has been building over the past few months, and today it’s actually here.
* Sparrow looks to be a great alternative to Mail.app and Google’s Gmail.app. The app features full IMAP support, which allows for Gmail, Google Apps, iCloud, Yahoo, AOL, Mobile Me, and other IMAP accounts to be hooked up. If you have multiple mailboxes, they can then be combined to display in one unified mailbox. The UI looks great.
* As you can see in the screenshots, unlike other mail apps, Sparrow displays the avatars of the people you’re emailing back and forth. There’s also smart contacts, which puts your most frequent contacts on top of the list.
* You can purchase Sparrow for iPhone on the iTunes App Store for $2.99.
