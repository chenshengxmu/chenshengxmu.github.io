* Just 24 hours after seeding iOS 9.3 beta 7 to developers and public testers, Apple on Tuesday released a seventh beta of the forthcoming OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 software update.
* The new version with a build number of 15E64a is available as an over-the-air update through the Mac App Store’s Purchased tab on Macs authorized for software development through the Apple Developer Program and on computers enrolled into the Apple Beta Software Program.
* A standalone installer can be download via Apple’s portal for developers. Apple also released a sixth beta of OS X Server 5.1 this morning.
* “The OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 update improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac,” notes Apple. The company is asking developers to focus on spotting bugs in iBooks, Messages, Photos and Notes apps.
* OS X 10.11.4 brings new features such as support for Verizon Wi-Fi Calling, Live Photos in the Messages app, a password-protected Notes, a fix for the frustrating Twitter link bug in Safari and more.
* We’ll update the post with any changes spotted in this release of OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 as we encounter them.
