* Which is faster? Well, obviously the iPhone 4S is faster, but you might be surprised at just how much faster.
* In certain areas, namely gaming, the iPhone 4S blows the iPhone 4 out of the water. In other areas, the differences are surprisingly less discernable.
* We’ve pitted the former heavyweight champ against the newcomer, and we’ve documented the results on video. Who wins? Watch and see…
* While the iPhone 4S won pretty much every one of these battles, some were much closer than one might expect.
* Be sure to take a look at the video, and see which areas the 4S dominated, and which areas the iPhone 4 fought back.
* What do you think? Are you finding your 4S to be much faster than your iPhone 4?
