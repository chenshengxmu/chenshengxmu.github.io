* The Weather Channel app has long been a favorite for iOS users. It provides fast, accurate information, and offers tons of features for the more serious weather watchers. In fact, the only complaint I’ve ever really heard about the app had to do with its decidedly dated design.
* That changed this morning, though, as the app was updated with an all-new iOS 7-inspired look. It now features rounded, translucent UI elements and larger, sharper graphics. Users will also notice that the app is much faster thanks to a number of performance improvements…
* Here is your full 6.0 change log:
* What’s New in Version 6.0.0
* Wow! Introducing our beautiful new scroll down iOS 7 redesign: – Social Weather—Share your weather conditions with us! We will use that information to identify hard-to-predict spots to improve the forecast for those areas. Plus, whenever you report your weather, you can take and share a photo of your current weather. We’ll keep track of them so you’ll have a personalized weather history. – Radar maps—Faster than ever – Design—Beautiful and easy to use. Perfectly aligned to the iOS7 aesthetic. – Improved navigation—swiping right to left allows you to browse your saved locations, whereas the detailed forecasts and stories can be viewed by swiping up and down. Check out detailed weather conditions by tapping the circle on the main screen. – App Icon—A new look for the app icon on your home screen signals something completely different, but with the same trusted weather information.
* And here are a few more screenshots:

* As much as the Weather Channel app needed a redesign, I actually think the Social Weather feature is more interesting. The WC is essentially crowdsourcing weather info—a tool that could come in handy in the event of severe weather. The local weatherman isn’t always accurate.
* Anyway, I know there are a number of weather applications available for iOS—click here for our top 10 picks of 2013—but it looks like the Weather Channel just put itself back in the discussion. It looks like the new look is iPhone only, and you can find it in the App Store for free.
