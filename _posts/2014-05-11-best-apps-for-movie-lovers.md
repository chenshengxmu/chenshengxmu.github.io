* I like to think of myself as a movie lover. I worked at an independent theater in my town during my entire college years. I used to go to the movies a lot more often than I do now, but I still make time to go whenever I can. These days, it’s so easy to watch blockbuster hits at home that I almost prefer the comforts of my living room more than a dark theater.
* Whether you prefer to make a bowl of popcorn at home, or like to sneak a bag of candies into your favorite theater, we have a list of what we think are the best apps for movie lovers…

* I love this app. It is a great place to catch up on movies that will be coming out within the year. You can watch trailers in crystal clear HD and send them to your T.V. through AirPlay. Even better, if you have Apple TV, there is already an iTunes Movie Trailers app installed. You can save your favorite theaters to quickly look up what is playing in your area. With the recent update, you can have notifications sent to you when a new movie comes out. This app is available for free.

* This app is special for a number of reasons. It is deeply integrated with Rotten Tomatoes, which is the number one source for critic reviews. You can also look up show times and buy tickets from your favorite theater and watch high quality trailers. One additional great feature is that you can stream and download content from your UltraViolet collection, which is the digital storage system that makes the download code for most of those Blu-Ray and DVDs you buy. This app is available for free.

* For a while now, Fandango has been the go-to place for online movie ticket purchases. You can now order tickets from your favorite theater, store them in Passbook, and even have your ticket scanned right at the front door from your iPhone instead of having to get a printed copy. On the iPad, you can watch Fandango original videos, get special content, and more. This app is available for free.

* We’ve all done it. We are watching a movie and a familiar actor appears on screen. We can’t remember where he is from, so we head to the Internet Movie Database to find out what else he has been in. This is an all-encompassing site for practically everything you want to know about a film including release date, location, director, and a link to every major actor’s other work. The app was recently updated to include whether a title is available on Amazon Prime for all you Fire TV owners. This app is available for free.

* I’ll never forget the catchy tagline, “Extra! Extra!” when I think of the entertainment news TV show that has been on the air for two decades. Fans of movies and television get small tidbits of gossip about their favorite celebrities, as well as information about upcoming movies, who is slated to star in your favorite book adaptation, and exclusive interviews with big wigs in the industry. This app is available for free.

* Of course, you don’t have to go to the theater to enjoy movie night. Sometimes, a night in is better anyway, especially if you have to tote a gaggle if little one’s with you. Netflix makes it possible for you to watch a huge variety of titles any time, anywhere. All you need is a reasonably priced monthly subscription and you can watch as many TV shows and movies as your brain can handle. This app is available for free.

* Those who have “cut the cord” on cable know just how important Hulu is to keeping up on some current shows. With a small monthly subscription price, you can watch current seasons of comedies like The Daily Show with John Stewart” and cartoons like “Sanjay and Craig.” These are shows you couldn’t normally watch without a cable subscription. The app also lets you watch your favorite shows on Xbox One, PS4, and PS3. This app is available for free.

* Watching television has become a social event, even if you don’t have a single friend in the room. With this app, you can talk about what you loved and hated about the last episode of The Walking Dead with others who’ve just finished watching it, too. You can also participate in live audience polls, create memes from TV moments, and unlock digital stickers when you check in with a show you are watching. This app is available for free.

* When I think of renting movies from a vending machine, I think of some futuristic movie from the 1980s, like “Back to the Future,” or “Death Race 2000.” Who would have thought that it would be possible to check out a movie from the local 7-Eleven without even having to speak to a human. With this app, you can reserve titles, and even stream movies right on your iPhone. If you are going to be without Internet access, you can download titles you’ve purchased for offline viewing. This app is available for free.

* You know how when you get to a movie early at the theater, there are oftentimes trivia questions to help you pass the time? Well, this app makes it possible for you to have that same experience at home. Plus, you can compete against friends, strangers, and even celebrity guests. It is integrated with iTunes, Fandango, Netflix and more for a full-featured experience. Oh, and you can watch a bunch of movie trailers, too. This app is available for free.
