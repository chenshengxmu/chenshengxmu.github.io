* Looking for an instantaneous method for blurring the background after invoking Notification Center?
* If so, then perhaps Ryan Petrich’s longwinded FastBlurredNotificationCenter will suit your needs.
* This is a free jailbreak tweak available on Petrich’s beta repo, which causes an instant blur effect for Notification Center.
* Inside we have a brief video of it in action, along with the link you need to score a free copy for yourself…
* If your iOS 5 device is jailbroken, simply add the following repo to your Cydia sources: http://rpetri.ch/repo/
* Being that the tweak is beta, it’s fairly bare bones, and there are no options to configure, or even as much as a simple kill switch.
* Still, for a free tweak, FastBlurredNotificationCenter does what it is intended to do, and does it well.
* How do you think this tweak compares to BlurriedNCBackground — another free tweak that lends a blurring effect to Notification Center?
