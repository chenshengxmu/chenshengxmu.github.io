* Bloomberg this morning ran a report which seemingly lends credence to earlier rumors that the next iPhone may include a pressure-sensitive Home button with Force Touch haptic feedback akin to the MacBook trackpad, in addition to improved low-light photography, cleaner antenna bands, iPhone 6s-like design, no headphone jack and more.
* “Apple Inc. is preparing to unveil successors to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus as early as next month with more advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware in a design similar to that of last year’s models,” read the report.
* According to unnamed sources, the standout features of the forthcoming devices are a dual-camera system on the 5.5-inch model, a re-engineered Home button that responds to pressure with haptic feedback and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack.
* The 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus (or ‘Pro’ model) is expected to have a dual-lens camera and Bloomberg tells us how having two lenses will improve your photography. The two sensors will each simultaneously snap up a picture, each capturing color differently.
* The software will then fuse those images into a single brighter shot with more detail, especially for shots taken in low-light environments, according to a person “who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device.”
* “The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity,” the source added, likely hinting at optical zoom capability, a first for the iPhone’s camera.
* An updated Home button for the new iPhones will no longer be mechanical.
* Instead, the report describes it as a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, similar to that of the trackpads on the latest MacBook line.
* Bloomberg also reaffirms the notion that the iPhone 7 will look similar to the iPhone 6/6s series, with a few visual tweaks like the removal of the two innermost antenna lines that run across the back of the current iPhones.
* The story goes on to “confirm” other rumored features, like the demise of the 3.5mm headphone jack and a pair of speaker grilles at the bottom for stereo sound.
* What do you make of this report?
