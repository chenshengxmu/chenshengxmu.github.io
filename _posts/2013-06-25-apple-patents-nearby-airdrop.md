* Among the 35 patents the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple Tuesday was a design for a never before seen icon entitled Nearby. The icon could describe a wireless transfer feature expected in iOS 7, called Airdrop. This latest patent dump also unveils new emoticons for Messages, as well as another design patent for Apple’s Lightning adapter…
* According to Patently Apple, the Nearby icon “may have been originally contemplated to cover nearby data transfers” as part of iOS 7.
* As we reported earlier this month, AirDrop would extend a feature already available on Lion-based Macs to new iOS devices, solving one of the biggest headaches: file transfers.
* Indeed, when first announced at this year’s WWDC, Apple poked fun at rival Samsung, telling the crowd files could be transferred without any bumping or walking around the room required.

* In another hint as to the meaning of the Nearby icon, Apple’s iOS 7 web page described Airdrop’s ability to find nearby users:
* Just tap Share, then select the person you want to share with. AirDrop does the rest using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. No setup required. And transfers are encrypted, so what you share is highly secure.
* Apple also was granted a patent on a new batch of emoticons for the Messages application, as well as the design of the Lightning adapter.

* A third intriguing patent describes a 3D trackpad for the MacBook which replaces the traditional keyboard and trackpad with a touch-sensitive glass on both sides. Such a design, Apple writes, could also be used in other devices, such as smartphones, desktop PC, and gaming consoles.
