* Welcome, Sprint. It’s been a long and arduous journey, but you made it to the promise land; you finally scored the iPhone.
* This: image from Apple’s online store, confirms that Sprint will be the official third US carrier of the next iPhone.
* These are the images that are displayed when asked to select a carrier on Apple’s website. See the Verzion and AT&T images for comparison.
* Just yesterday, the image wasn’t there, but we checked today, and sure enough, there it is. What could this mean for Sprint as a carrier?
* Most importantly, Sprint can compete with AT&T and Verizon when it comes to their Smartphone offerings. No offense to the Evo, and other Android phones, but iPhones they are not.
* Even Sprint’s CEO admitted that Sprint has been at a disadvantage by not having the iPhone. This time, Sprint wasn’t taking any chances.
* Yesterday, a WSJ report revealed that Sprint had made a steep, “bet the company” investment, to guarantee their seat at Apple’s table.
* Whether or not this will pay off or not, still remains to be seen.
* Are you a Sprint customer? Would you consider switching to Sprint for one of their famed unlimited plans? Let us know in the comments below…
