* According to AnoStyle, they use the same anodization process Apple taps in manufacturing and which makes the iPhone 5 the Rolex of smartphones.
* Our process does not involve simple painting or covering. Rather, we use a process called anodization, and we’ve found a unique method that allows us to deliver the best results each and every time. Anodization actually involves a specialized chemical process that creates the desired color change.
* This means under normal use, our AnoStyle™ products won’t chip or wear like traditional paints and coatings do. Once the color transformation is complete, we run your device through our 21-point test to ensure that it is working perfectly.
