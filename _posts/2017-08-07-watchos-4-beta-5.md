* Along with iOS 11 beta 5, Apple today seeded watchOS 4 beta 5 (build number 15R5345g) to the registered developers and members of its developer program.
* Non-developers are not permitted to test the software because the company’s official public beta-testing program currently does not support the watchOS platform.
* If you’re a developer and would like to install watchOS 4 beta 5 on your Apple Watch over the air, tap My Watch → General → Software Update in the Watch app on your paired iPhone.
* Your phone must be running iOS 11 beta 5 to see and download watchOS 4 beta 5.
* TUTORIAL: How to switch from watchOS beta to public release
* Your Apple Watch and paired iPhone must use appropriate configuration profiles, available via Apple’s Dev Center portal. The watch must be connected to its paired iPhone, have at least 50 percent power and be placed on its magnetic charging disk in order to install the beta.
* Andrew’s hands-on videos, embedded below, discuss all the changes in the previous beta, such as new animations, all- new Toy Story faces, icon tweaks, tons of bug fixes and more.
