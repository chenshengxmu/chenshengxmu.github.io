* According to Variety, Apple’s latest original video content deal is “Calls,” an English-language adaptation of the French short-form series Canal+ that let viewers experience short stories via real-life audio sources and minimal visuals.
* The publication said Friday that the new English-language series will be a co-production with Canal+. The original was developed and produced under the Canal+ Creation Originale label.
* Created by Timothée Hochet, the original show allowed audiences to experience short stories through “real-life audio sources and minimal visuals.” In fact, Apple as part of this deal has also acquired the rights to the first season of the French original, Variety claims.
* Apple continues to fill out its series programming pipeline.
* Recently, the Cupertino firm has struck a major deal for multiple new series from children’s programmer Sesame Workshop, ordered the “Little America” anthology series from Lee Eisenberg and “The Big Sick” writers Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon while announcing a multi-year content deal with media mogul Oprah Winfrey.
