* Satechi has previewed their upcoming 75W USB-C multi-charger at CES 2018. We went hands on to check it out, as well as to get a preview of their upcoming Bluetooth keyboard.
* This handy charger which is similar to Anker’s PowerPort+ allows you to power a USB-C device like a Retina MacBook or MacBook Pro with up to 60W of power. The whole thing is capable of 75W, but the other power can be split between the additional 3 USB-A ports.
* One of the USB-A ports is also capable of using Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3 for fast charging supported Android devices.

* 60W may not be quite enough for the 15″ MacBook Pro (which can handle 87W), but it is by far one of the fastest we’ve seen, and includes a nice, durable, aluminum body.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
