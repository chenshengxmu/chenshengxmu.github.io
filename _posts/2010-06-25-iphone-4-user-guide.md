* Just got a new iPhone 4 and you’re not sure how to use it? That’s why Apple created an iPhone 4 user guide. From setting up your email to adding contacts, this 244 page PDF will walk you through every single step of the iPhone set up.
* Obviously this iPhone 4 user guide was not designed for people who already own an iPhone but I’m sure it will help first-time iPhone owners.
* You can download the iPhone 4 user guide in PDF from here, or just go to help.apple.com/iphone/ from your iPhone.
* If you have a specific question about the use of your iPhone, please DO NOT ask it here. Instead, go to our forums where other users will be able to help you.
