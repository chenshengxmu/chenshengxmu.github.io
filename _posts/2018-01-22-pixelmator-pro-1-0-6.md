* Pixelmator Pro, a machine learning-powered version of the popular Photoshop replacement for macOS featuring a single-window interface and pro-grade capabilities, has received some notable improvements in its most recent update.
* Pixelmator Pro 1.0.6 brings custom aspect ratios and custom presets to the crop tool, as well as a bunch of other improvements and bug fixes that improve your workflow.
* Not only can you define your own custom ratios for the crop tool, but save them as presets so they can be easily imported on another computer. You can now copy, cut, paste and duplicate the components inside shapes, hold down the Space bar to move selections while using the Rectangular and Elliptical selection tools and more.
* P.S. If you haven’t done it yet, make sure to update to macOS High Sierra 10.13.2. It’s got a few very important fixes that improve the performance of both Pixelmator and Pixelmator Pro.
