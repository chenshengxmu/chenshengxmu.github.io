* Perhaps the highlight feature of the new iPad is its Retina display. And folks I’m not kidding, the Retina display is absolutely gorgeous. It features more pixels than your 1080p HDTV, leaving it to be clearest tablet display that is currently on the market. The Retina display boasts a 2048 x 1536 resolution, which contains a whopping 3.1 million pixels. The eye can’t even single the pixels out.
* We’ve already shown you the iPad 2 and iPad 3’s display shown off side-by-side, and it’s obvious which one is better. Our test was pretty unscientific, but hey, it worked. However, software engineer Lukas Mathias put both the iPad 2 and new iPad’s display under a microscope, to take a look at the total pixel count, giving us a better look…
* Mathis set his microscope to 80x magnification:

* From the side-by-side above, you can really see the difference in how many pixels the third-generation iPad has, compared to the iPad 2. Apple said the new iPad has quadruple the pixels, and that appears to be true.
* Mathis also put the new iPad beside the iPhone 4S, both of which have similar Retina displays. The iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 contain a few more pixels, 326 ppi, while the new iPad is at 264 ppi.

* The new iPad has one of the best displays I’ve ever seen on a mobile device. The eye can’t make out individual pixels on the Retina display, leaving you under the impressions that you’re just looking at paper. We’ll talk more about it in our review coming up.
* What do you think of the Retina display? Does it live up to the hype?
