* It looks as if iOS 9.3 beta 1 has already been jailbroken, which lends hope that a public version of an iOS 9.3.x jailbreak may be possible. But don’t hold your breath; this is the same hacker/developer—Luca Todesco—that recently shared a screenshot of a jailbroken iPhone 6 running iOS 9.2.1. He previously made it clear that he has no intention of sharing, and it doesn’t look like that’s changing anytime soon.
* In the video, Todesco shows off some of the new iOS 9.3 beta 1 features that Apple released earlier today, including the new Night Shift mode for changing the gamma values of the iPhone’s screen.
* Like I said, the likelihood of this ever arriving on public iPhones is slim to none, but it’s interesting nonetheless. Let’s hope that someone else will be kind enough to provide us with a future jailbreak.
* What do you think?
