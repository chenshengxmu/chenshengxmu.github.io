* Inductive charging is all the rage these days. Palm was the first mobile manufacturer to bring ‘magic’ charging to the mainstream with its Palm Pre and Touchstone accessory.
* Since then, iPhone case manufacturers have jumped to bring the same kind of functionality to Apple’s smartphone, allowing the handset to be charged by placing it on a mat of sorts. No plugs, no connectors. Magic.
* According to a new Apple patent discovered by Patently Apple, the Cupertino outfit may be planning to bring inductive charging to the iPhone in a more practical way, while adding the typical Apple flair to proceedings…
* The patent allows for a charging “tower” which will provide the power, but the way the energy gets from the tower to the iPhone is a interesting one.
* According to Patently Apple, a user’s earphones will be wrapped around the tower, creating an inductive receiving coil. The earphones then obviously connect to the iPhone and, subsequently, power it.
* “Apple’s invention relates to a technique for inductively charging an electronic device which involves winding an audio cable for the electronic device around a charging mechanism multiple times so that one or more conductors in the audio cable form an inductive receiving coil. Next, a magnetic field is created through the charging mechanism to induce a current in the inductive receiving coil. Finally, the induced current in the inductive receiving coil is used to charge a rechargeable battery for the electronic device.”
* It’s an interesting approach that Apple is exploring, and we never really thought they’d follow the same conventions as Palm.
* As with most of the patents applied for by Apple, there’s no telling whether this will ever see the light of day in a sellable form, but the fact that the company is even looking into inductive charging and its benefits at least shows they recognize that it does indeed have its uses.
* Having said that, it didn’t save Palm now, did it?
