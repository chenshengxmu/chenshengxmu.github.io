* Nintendo will drop Super Mario Run into the App Store on Thursday, December 15. The Apple-Nintendo partnership was first unveiled as, perhaps, the only surprise during the September iPhone 7 launch event. The iDB team couldn’t be more excited about Nintendo’s decision to build a full platform game for iOS, which has been long over due.
* We are joining the excitement by offering a way to deck out your favorite iOS device with a set of Super Mario wallpapers with this week’s Wallpapers of the Week. Take a step inside for the downloads.
* Our own Andrew O’Hara spent time playing the demo version at his local Apple Store and already posted a short review video, if you are hoping to see in-game action. Super Mario Run is receiving quite a bit of mainstream hype before launch, as one would expect for a first Nintendo offering of this kind, with an interview on the Late Night Show and a very informative 45 minute Apple video podcast [visit via a mobile device] interview with Shigeru Miyamoto.
* Nintendo even launched a full two-minute live action commercial.
