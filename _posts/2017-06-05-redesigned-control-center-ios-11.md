* One of the many new features in iOS 11 is a completely redesigned Control Center. As you can see in the above screenshot, it looks nothing like the previous design, with more of a widget-style interface, and yes—it’s back to a single page.
* Apple describes it as far more customizable than previous versions of Control Center, allowing you to quickly access the settings for things you do most. We haven’t tried it yet, but it looks like you can customize at least some of the settings and app shortcuts that appear here.
* This being a smaller feature in the grand scheme of the iOS 11 update, there aren’t many other details available yet. We are currently installing the developer beta and will be sure to publish a post with a full breakdown of the new CC.
