* Changing the way teams use email, Spark 2.0 helps business customers get things done and communicate more easily than before with collaborative features like the ability to create emails together, discuss email privately, create a link to an email message and more.
* Here’s a quick overview of the key features aimed at teams:
* Nedless to say, they’ll be adding new functionality continuously.
* TIPS: Use these 3 great Spark features to save time
* Readdle commented:
* Our team is fundamentally saturated with knowledge about email.
* We have interviewed hundreds of teams, replied to thousands of emails from customers and gone through dozen design iterations to come up with an elegant solution to significantly boost your team’s email workflow.
* Check out the promotional video for Spark 2.0 embedded below.
* And now, watch the animations embedded below that highlight some of the marquee Spark 2.0 features, like private team comments, shared Drafts and linking to emails.

* On the iPhone and iPad side, Spark has introduced powerful new third-party service integrations—in addition to Apple’s stock Reminders and Files apps, Spark for iOS now lets you access 2Do, Omnifocus, Things, Wunderlist, Todoist, Asana, Trello and Bear apps.
* As for an Apple Watch version of Spark, which by the way is one of the better watchOS apps out there, Readdle tells me Spark’s watchOS update will be ready a bit later after 2.0’s launch.
* Today’s update is provided at no extra cost to all existing users of the app.
* Spark will employ a subscription business model that’s similar to Slack.
* In other words, Spark will continue to be free for personal email and core team functionality. Teams can upgrade to a Premium subscription for $7.99 per user per month or $6.39 per user per month if billed annually, a 20% discount.
