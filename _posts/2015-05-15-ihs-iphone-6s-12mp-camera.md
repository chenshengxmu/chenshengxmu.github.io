* Apple’s forthcoming iPhone refresh — presumably an ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ — is set for a major upgrade in the camera department as Apple has reportedly relented and decided to join the megapixel race with a twelve-megapixel iSight camera on the back of the new phone(s).
* But the megapixels don’t tell the whole story.
* According to Kevin Wang, IHS’s Technology Research Director for China, the pixel size will be smaller, raising questions about the camera’ performance in low-light conditions.
* Wang has reportedly “confirmed” the twelve-megapixel iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus camera. Although smaller pixels would represent a step back from the large pixels on current iPhone cameras, Apple may employ several tricks to improve the next iPhone’s low-light performance, such as a more advanced image processing pipeline, a larger aperture and sensor size and more.
* One source recently predicted that the next iPhone will have a dual-lens camera out the back with optical zoom rather than digital one, potentially enabling additional imaging improvements.
* For years, Apple’s been using eight-megapixel cameras on iPhones since the introduction of the iPhone 4s back in the fall of 2011.
* Rather than join the megapixel race, Apple has opted to improve imaging capabilities of iPhones by introducing better lens, more advanced image signal processors, larger pixels and a number of software features which have improved image quality considerably.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted a switch to a twelve-megapixel sensor on the next iPhone, in addition to a faster A9 chip with 2GB of higher-clocked LPDDR4 RAM, a new rose gold color option and more.
