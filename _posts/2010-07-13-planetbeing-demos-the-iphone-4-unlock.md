title: PlanetBeing Demos the iPhone 4 Unlock
---
* I told you this morning about PlanetBeingâ€™s unlock for the iPhone 4. PlanetBeing put up a video on YouTube explaining the unlock, which is the very first carrier unlock for the iPhone 4 in the world.
* According to PlanetBeing, this unlock is still a beta version and needs a lot of cleaning before being potentially released to the public. PlanetBeing also confirmed that MuscleNerd is working on a software unlock as well, and they will decide which of the 2 methods to release when they are ready to.
