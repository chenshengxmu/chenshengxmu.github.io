* Mobile messaging platform Viber today rolled out a new version of its iPhone app in the App Store which enables native experience on your Apple Watch. While pretty basic, the app is functional, easy to use and efficient.
* With it, you can read and respond to messages straight from your wrist, and even send stickers created exclusively for the Apple Watch, all without having to pull an iPhone out of your pocket. Viber is available at no charge in the App Store.
* Before you can use Viber’s wrist app, make sure to update your copy of Viber for iPhone to the latest version. Then, launch the companion Watch app on your iPhone and head over to the Viber section to install the app on your Apple Watch. Lastly, launch Viber for iPhone and register with the service if you haven’t already to get started.

* Similar to other Apple Watch apps, Viber lets you respond to incoming messages with dictation, canned responses and Viber’s own stickers. Just press the display firmly to access hidden options for replying with stickers, canned responses or dictation.
* Here’s everything you can do in Viber for Apple Watch:
* Before today, you could only mirror Viber’s alerts from your iPhone onto your wrist but not interact with them or reply to messages. Lastly, a dedicated Apple Watch section within Viber for iPhone let you define your own canned responses to be used from your wrist.
