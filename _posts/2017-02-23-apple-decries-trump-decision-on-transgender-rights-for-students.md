* The United States President Donald Trump’s decision which aims to withdraw anti-discrimination protections for transgender bathroom use in schools was met with strong opposition from Apple. In a statement to Axios, Apple said preventing transgender students from using bathroom facilities designated for the gender to which they identify is hurting human rights initiatives.
* “Apple believes everyone deserves a chance to thrive in an environment free from stigma and discrimination,” said a company spokesperson.
* “We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals. We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections.”
* Reuters reported yesterday that President Trump rolled back protections for transgender kids in schools. These anti-discrimination measures date back to the Obama administration, which threatened to cease funding for schools that wouldn’t permit transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice.
* In July 2016, Apple signed an amicus brief in support for the US Justice Department’s efforts to repeal the bill, known as HB2, which aimed to prohibit transgender people in North Carolina from entering bathrooms and locker rooms inconsistent with the gender listed on their birth certificate.
* Apple’s boss Tim Cook is a strong advocate for LGBT rights and has spoken out against a number of states that have sought to pass laws limiting LGBT rights. More recently, the Cupertino company along with other technology giants signed a letter opposing the administration’s travel ban.
* The controversial policy was later shot down by a Washington state court and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
