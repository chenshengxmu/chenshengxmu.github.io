* During the keynote presentation this morning which kicked off Google I/O 2016, the Internet giant previewed its much-anticipated entry into the voice-activated home device market in the form of a new appliance, named Google Home.
* With a built-in Google Assistant that also powers Duo, a new smart messaging app coming to iOS and Android this summer, Home lets you retrieve information from the Internet, get answers to simple questions and carry out basic tasks—using your voice and the familiar “OK Google” wakeup phrase.
* Google bills Home as a voice-activated product that brings the Google Assistant to any room in your house. Like Amazon’s Echo appliance, Home is in an always-listening mode, ready to respond to your spoken queries.
* Using conversational speech, you can ask Home to play a song, set a timer for the oven, check your flight, turn on your lights, manage your everyday tasks, get answers from Google and more. The accessory has customizable bases in different colors and materials to hit your interior style.
* The Mountain Valley firm wouldn’t commit to any specific release date other than saying that Home will be released later this year.
