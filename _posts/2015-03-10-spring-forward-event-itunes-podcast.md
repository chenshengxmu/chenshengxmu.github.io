* Following yesterday’s “Spring Forward” media event which brought us new Apple Watch details and pricing, an exclusive HBO Now launch on the now-discounted Apple TV, some interesting medical research news and a Retina-enabled twelve-inch MacBook with USB-Type C, Force Touch trackpad and silver, space grey and gold finishes, now the whole presentation can be downloaded and kept on your computer in the form of a video podcast.
* The media presentation runs one hour and thirty-six minutes long and can be downloaded in standard, HD or full HD resolution via the Apple Events podcast channels on iTunes.
* Here are the download links:
* Apple typically refreshes these podcasts with new event videos a few hours after the presentation has wrapped.
* To have them automatically download to your Mac, iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, just subscribe to Apple Keynotes, Apple Keynotes (HD) or Apple Keynotes (1080p) on your device and turn on the automatic download option in podcast settings.
* My colleague Cody has put together a nice recap article of everything Apple announced yesterday so give it a quick read and explore the included articles pertaining to the individual announcements and a ton of various tidbits you should know about, like the Watch’s battery life, storage capacity and limitations and much more.
