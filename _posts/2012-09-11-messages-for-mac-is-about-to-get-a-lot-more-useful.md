* As 9to5Mac just pointed out, Apple has released OS X 10.8.2 build 12C50 to developers, and it packs quite a few useful features.
* Most notably, in my opinion, is the new syncing ability between iMessages sent to a telephone number. Now, any iMessage can be sent and received from a Mac running OS X 10.8.2, regardless of whether or not it’s a phone number or an email address.
* I don’t know about you, but this has always seemed like a glaring omission, and serves to make iMessage that much more of a relevant communication tool on the desktop.

* Now anytime you receive a message on your iPhone, it syncs with your Mac, and vice versa. Everything is completely in tune as far as iMessage goes.

* Along with that notable feature, comes single sign on for Facebook, and Game Center sharing.
* Here is the full change log:
* The 10.8.2 update is recommended for all OS X Mountain Lion users and includes new features and fixes. New features include:
* Facebook • Single sign on for Facebook • Facebook as an option when sharing links and photos • Facebook friends’ contact information and profile pictures in Contacts • Facebook notifications in Notification Center

* The 10.8.2 update also includes general operating system fixes that improve the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac, including the following fixes: • An option to discard the changes in the original document when choosing Save As • Unsent drafts are opened automatically when launching Mail • Receive Twitter notifications for mentions and replies from anyone • URLs are shortened when sending tweets from Notification Center • Notifications are disabled when AirPlay Mirroring is being used • SSL support for Google searches from the Smart Search Field in Safari • New preference to have Safari launch with previously open webpages

* Needless to say, you should be fairly excited about this upcoming update. As you can see, some of the features, like Passbook support, correspond directly with the imminent iOS 6 release for mobile devices.

* Note: as many of you have pointed out, iMessage sync is not new to this particular build, but it is new to OS X 10.8.2, which we have just began covering. Hence, it was worth bringing out.
