* Hot off the heels of the Corona iBooks fix, MuscleNerd tweeted that RedSn0w has been updated to 0.9.10b4 to incorporate the fix for Apple’s mobile book app.
* The good news for current RedSn0w users is that all you have to do is rerun the new version over your existing jailbreak in order to receive the fix.
* redsn0w 0.9.10b4 (update 4 is.gd/dO7hc5) includes the iBooks fix…thanks to @xvolks for porting it to @pod2g‘s corona!

* For those of you without access to a computer, or who don’t feel like bothering with RedSn0w again, you can always install the latest version of Corona that we posted about earlier.
* The Dev Team goes on to say that like the update to Corona, the latest version of RedSn0w includes a fix for the sporadic launchctl issues as well.
* Of course, if you’ve still yet to jailbreak your iPhone 4 or other A4 device, check out our RedSn0w page for the full scoop on how to do so.
* If you already know how, mosey on over to our downloads page to download the latest version of RedSn0w — 0.9.10b4.
