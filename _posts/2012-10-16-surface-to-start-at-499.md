* As Microsoft is gearing up to launch its highly-anticipated Surface tablet next Friday, October 26 (just three days following Apple’s iPad mini keynote), the company began teasing the public with the first Surface commercial Cody told you about. And now, the Windows maker has officially revealed price points for the tablet: the ARM-based entry-level Surface RT will start at $499 for the 32GB model, the same asking price for Apple’s third-generation iPad with sixteen gigabytes of storage…
* The price excludes, however, the Touch Cover which is an optional purchase (available in white, red, black, blue and purple) that will run you an additional $119.99. The Type Cover is ten bucks pricier at $129.99 and is available only in black. If you buy a 64GB Surface RT with a Touch Cover included, the combo will set you back $699.
* These prices came via Microsoft’s online store.

* The page was briefly available before Microsoft pulled it, but The Verge has been able to screenshot it.
* Here’s the aforementioned inaugural Surface commercial.
* The Surface RT goes on sale online and across Microsoft’s retail stores on October 26, alongside worldwide release of Windows 8. The device has vapor-deposited (PVD) magnesium chassis, it’s 9.3mm thin, weighs in at 1.5lbs and comes with a built-in kickstand.
* The company will hold a Surface press conference on October 25. The Surface for Windows Pro 8 device will debut three months later.
* What do you think about the price points?
