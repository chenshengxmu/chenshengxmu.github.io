* On Friday, a Tokyo court found a number of Samsung’s legacy smartphone models to be guilty of infringing on one of Apple’s patents. More specifically, it’s the infamous ‘rubber banding’ patent, which Apple has used in a number of courtroom battles.
* For those unfamiliar with the ‘rubber banding’ property, it covers the software action that triggers the bounce-back animation when a user reaches the end of a scrolling document. And the Japan court feels older Samsung handsets infringe upon it…
* Reuters reports:
* “A Tokyo court ruled on Friday that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed on rival Apple Inc’s patent for a “bounce-back” feature on earlier models of its popular smartphones.
* Apple claimed that Samsung had copied the “bounce-back”, in which icons on its smartphones and tablets quiver back when users scroll to the end of an electronic document.”
* It’s worth pointing out that the ruling only refers to Samsung’s older smartphones—the company has already changed its interface on recent models to show a blue line at the end of documents. But today’s outcome could still have significant ramifications.
* For one, we don’t yet know what (if any) damages were awarded. And two, this further solidifies the validity of Apple’s powerful ‘rubber-banding’ patent, which has recently come under heavy fire as it was invalidated and then revalidated by the US Patent Office.
* The latter probably means much more to Apple than money, but I’m most interested in the damages amount. If Apple was able to prove Samsung’s infringement made a major impact on its handset sales in the country, it could be awarded some big bucks.
* The court says it will release more details on the ruling later today.
* Apple and Samsung are currently involved in patent lawsuits in 10 countries. Apple won a major victory against the South Korean tech giant back in August of last year, and Samsung just won a big ITC case against Apple that could see some of its products banned.
