* Apple has just released an incremental iOS 6.0.2 update fixing issues with wireless network connections on the iPad mini and iPhone 5. According to Apple, the software “fixes a bug that could impact Wi-Fi”. Previous reports have suggested that these devices suffer from a carrier-agnostic Wi-Fi issue that could result in unwarranted cellular data usage while on a Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, Apple does not name the exact Wi-Fi bug that has been fixed with this update…
* Some iPhone 5 owners complained about limited range and issues with data speeds over Wi-Fi. Hopefully, the iOS 6.0.2 update addresses these problems. There are no user-facing features as this clearly is just a maintenance update.
* From Apple’s release notes:
* iOS 6.0.2 Software Update
* This update contains improvements and bug fixes, including:
* • Fixes a bug that could impact Wi-Fi
* For information on the security content of this update, please visit this website: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222
* The new software arrives hot on the heels of the fourth beta of the incoming iOS 6.1 update, which was released to Apple’s registered developers yesterday.
* Apple on November 1 issued the iOS 6.0.1 update (yes, you can jailbreak it) for iOS devices, fixing the virtual keyboard glitch and improving Wi-Fi reception.

* You can apply the iOS 6.0.2 update directly on your iPhone 5 or iPad mini by choosing General > Software Update in Settings.
* We’ve been getting error messages when checking for over-the-air updates. If OTA is down for you, just plug your device into iTunes and click “Check for Update” to get the latest version.
