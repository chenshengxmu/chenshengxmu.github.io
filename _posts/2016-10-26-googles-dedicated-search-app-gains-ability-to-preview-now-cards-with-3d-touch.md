* Google today issue a small update to its dedicated search app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Bumped to version 20.3, the free of charge app has gained the ability to preview Google Now cards with 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
* Just press a card within the app to peek at its contents, then swipe up to access additional options or press harder to open the card in fullscreen mode.
* As mentioned, swiping up while peeking at a Now card reveals hidden options at the bottom of the screen allowing you to copy the URL, share the item using iOS’s multi-purpose Share sheet and more.

* Grab Google for iOS for free from the App Store.
