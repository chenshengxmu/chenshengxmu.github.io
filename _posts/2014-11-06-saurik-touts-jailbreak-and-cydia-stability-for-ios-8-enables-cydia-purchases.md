* Another day, another milestone. Saurik, the man behind Cydia, has re-enabled purchases for paid Cydia apps and tweaks, which means that you can now purchase apps and tweaks that were, for a time, unobtainable for some.
* He also made sure to lend credibility to the stability of both Cydia and the iOS 8 jailbreak via a pair of tweets—the first of such since the iOS 8 jailbreak arrived.
* If you are waiting to jailbreak your iOS 8.0-8.1 device until things are "stable enough": we now seem to be ready! ;P http://t.co/XRUU74p7i8

* After many updates, both on Pangu’s side and on Cydia’s side, Mr. Freeman a.k.a. Saurik, has exclaimed that “we now seem to be ready!” It’s been a long and somewhat arduous journey for this particular jailbreak, and its set to hit its crescendo when the Mac version of Pangu releases within the next day or so.
* Cydia vendors can now mark their products as iOS 8 compatible. (The jailbreak platform itself is now stable enough to make this reasonable.)

* In the meantime, Cydia vendors can now mark their products for sale for iOS 8, something many have been waiting for since the jailbreak debuted. I think that finally is an appropriate adverb to describe this particular moment. Now we can really expect to see developers begin to hammer away at official iOS 8 tweak and app releases.
* What are your thoughts on the whole jailbreak situation for iOS 8 thus far? Has your opinion changed at all over the last few hours, or are you still planning on staying put?
