* Some of you might already be offended just by reading the title of this post. How dare we share tips on how to remove the blur effects in iOS? How can we, in just one post, put an end to something that some might consider one of the core design guidelines of iOS? Something that the design team at Apple spent months and months working on. Well, we like options and we also like for you to know that you have options.
* Just like I recently shared a simple tip on how to speed up animations in iOS, I want to show you how you can get rid of the blur effects in iOS.
* The main reason why you’d want to disable the blur effects and transparency in iOS is to improve contrast on some backgrounds in order to improve legibility. If you have vision problems, removing blur effects might indeed help you see what’s on your screen better.
* Of course, you might also not be too fond of the blur effects to begin with, and this is a good reason to get rid of them. For the record, I find those blur effects to be essential to the iOS experience so I didn’t disable them on my own device.
* In order to remove blur effects in iOS, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast > Reduce Transparency > On.

* As far as I can tell, the main spots where blur effects are present – and thus where they can be disabled – are in Notification Center, in Control Center, and a few apps such as Safari, Mail, etc.
* As you can see from the images above, the changes aren’t dramatic but they are very much noticeable. Control Center and Notification Center will lose their blurry effect for a plain gray background. I have to say the black background of Notification Center does look pretty slick, but of course, it’s all personal preferences.
* What do you think? Are blurry backgrounds enough of an annoyance for you to get rid of them?
