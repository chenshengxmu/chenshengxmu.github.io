* NoDelay64 is a recently released jailbreak tweak for iPhone 5s owners. It’s a tweak that removes the delay from the appearance of the “slide to unlock” on Touch ID enabled devices.
* Apple adds a delay to the famous “slide to unlock” text, because it assumes that most iPhone 5s users with Touch ID enabled will be using Touch ID instead. This new tweak gets rid of that delay with a simple Cydia install. Have a look past the jump to see how it works on video.
* After NoDelay64 is installed, you should immediately notice the slide to unlock text appear on your iPhone 5s’ Lock screen. There are no options or settings to configure, just install it and go.

* Some may be wondering why the developer decided to name the tweak NoDelay64. My best guess is that the 64 stands for the fact that the iPhone 5s is a 64-bit device, and nothing more. Although the iPad mini with Retina display and iPad Air are both 64-bit devices as well, neither of those devices sport the Touch ID sensor that the iPhone 5s does.
* You can find NoDelay64 for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about this tweak in the comments that lie beneath.
