* Apple and Nike recently announced Apple Watch NikeLab, basically a co-branded limited-xdition Apple Watch Series 2 using a Space Gray aluminum case paired with a new Light Bone band in a creamy color combination featuring black perforations. The device is arriving Thursday, April 27, and now Highsnobiety has posted some pretty gorgeous hands-on photos ahead of tomorrow’s release.
* Closeups reveal the NikeLab Innovation x Innovators logo on the inside of the strap.
* The Light Bone/Black Nike Sport Band combo is meant to coordinate with the similarly neutral-toned “Oreo” and “White/Blue” VaporMax sneakers releasing this week.

* Aside from its strap in the previously unavailable Light Bone color combination, plus some Nike branding and exclusive Nike complications, watch faces and Siri commands, this is your ordinary Apple Watch Series 2 hardware with built-in GPS, S2 processor and more.
