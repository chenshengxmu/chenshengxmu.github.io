* There’s always been an argument that the 3G-equipped iPads are just 9.7″ iPhones without a calling plan. While VoIP apps, such as Skype, can indeed turn iPads into a phone of sorts, there’s never been a way to make proper cellular calls using Apple’s tablets. Until now.
* Enter a new jailbreak app courtesy of iPhoneIslam, the same guys who brought us FaceIt3GS – an app that allows iPhone 3GS users to get in on the FaceTime bandwagon.
* Called PhoneItiPad, this jailbreak tweak allows owners of the iPad 3G to make telephone calls using their cellular connection just like an iPhone, making the iPad the world’s largest phone…
* Available for $19.99 from the apps.iphoneislam.com repository in Cydia, PhoneItiPad will require users to hand over their device’s ICCID – a unique identifier for mobile cellular devices. Some may understandably be apprehensive about handing over such a unique and identifiable number, but it’s a necessity if you really must make calls from a near 10″ phone, writes RedmondPie.
* So how do you get your hands on PhoneItiPad?
* Unfortunately, this particular tweak isn’t currently compatible with the iOS 5 beta, so keep that in mind before you hand over your money for PhoneItiPad.
* Have you tried PhoneItiPad yet? How well does it work? And do you believe that hefty $19.99 price tag is worth it? Let us know your thoughts on the tweak in the comments below!
