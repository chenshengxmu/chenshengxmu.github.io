* Apple on Monday issued a security update for OS X to address a handful of vulnerabilities, including the high profile SSL flaw known as “FREAK.” Spotlighted last week, the bug allows would-be attackers to spy on communications made through Safari.
* More specifically, FREAK stands for Factoring RSA Export Keys, and it affects certain embodiments of web encryption technologies SSL and TLS. If used maliciously, the flaw could leave systems open to what are known as man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Apple spokesman Ryan James told reporters last week that Apple was aware of the problem, and was working on updates to rectify it. Today, the company released security updates for OS X, Apple TV, and iOS—iOS 8.2, which also adds the Apple Watch app.
* To update your iOS device, simply launch your Settings app and navigate to General > Software Update (jailbreakers beware). On Apple TV, open Settings > General > Software Updates, and of course on OS X, visit the Updates tab of the Mac App Store.
