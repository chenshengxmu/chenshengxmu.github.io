* Yesterday, the Unicode Consortium announced a tenth major iteration of the industry-standard character coding system, called Unicode Standard. Aside from the 8,518 new characters added in this release (for a total of 136,690 characters), Unicode 10 offers 56 uniquely new emoji characters with flags and gender/skin tone modifiers bringing that total to 239.
* The Unicode Consortium is making the new emoji sets available ahead of time so that vendors can begin working on their emoji fonts and code. Apple is likely to roll out these new emoji across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple Watch during the September-December timeframe via point updates to iOS 10, macOS High Sierra and watchOS 4.
* Emojipedia provided the complete list of the 56 new emoji in Unicode 10:
* The Bitcoin sign (it looks like a capital letter B with two vertical lines) and a set of Typicon marks and symbols are among the more important character additions in Unicode 10. The updated standard also includes four new scripts, for a total of 139 scripts.
* Apple implements emoji characters on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV as part of the Apple Color Emoji font. How do you like the new emoji in Unicode 10, what’s your favorite, and why? Tell us in comments!
