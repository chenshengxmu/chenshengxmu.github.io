* Fierce rivals AT&T and Verizon were featured in a commercial together to prove the point that two is better than one. If one didn’t know the backstory, it would almost appear that the two rival networks were cool with each other.
* Only a company like Apple could pull something like this off. Can you imagine any other phone warranting a commercial that includes a cameo from two competing networks like AT&T and Verizon? I don’t think so.
* Check inside for the full commercial…
* So is two really better than one? I’m sure AT&T doesn’t think so, being as they held exclusivity to all versions of the iPhone for the past few years in the United States, reaping tons of money and attention as a result.
* I’m sure when their shareholders saw this commercial they threw up in their mouth a bit.
* What do you think?
