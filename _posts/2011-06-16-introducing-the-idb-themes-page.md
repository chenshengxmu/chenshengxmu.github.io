* Judging by the popularity of pasts posts regarding themes, we understand that there’s a very strong theming interest in the jailbreak community.
* For that reason, we are proud to unveil our new “Themes” page which will be the permanent hub for all of our theme coverage, video tutorials, walkthroughs, and faqs.
* We plan to update our theme page with at least one new walkthrough of a popular theme each week, but likely more.
* Interested in seeing what our new Themes page looks like? Step inside for a look around…
* The first part of our new theme page contains basic faqs about theming in general. If the word “WinterBoard” makes you go “huh?” then by all means start here.
* You’ll then find an explanation of some of the different types of themes available for iOS.
* Last but not least, you’ll find dedicated sections for the different theming platforms.
* We’ve started off with DreamBoard since that seems to be the platform that folks have the most trouble with, but we will eventually cover WinterBoard basics as well.
* You’ll also find handy video tutorials to troubleshoot some of the most common issues occurring within the theming community.
* We’ve even included themes that let you make your iPhone look like Windows:
* Or BlackBerry:
* Or Android…
* Or…well, you get the point!
* At iDB we’re always looking to provide you with the most anticipated and thorough coverage, and we feel that our new Theme page will fit right in amongst a bevy of other awesome tutorials and guides.
* Please give us your feedback on this new page, and by all means let us know if there’s anything you’d like to see in particular.
* Happy theming!
