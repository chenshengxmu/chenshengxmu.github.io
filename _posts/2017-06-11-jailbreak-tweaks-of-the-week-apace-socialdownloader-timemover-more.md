* It has been a busy week amid preparations for WWDC 2017, but that hasn’t stopped the jailbreak community from hammering out jailbreak tweaks to improve the aesthetic and function of jailbroken iPhones and iPads.
* In this piece, we’ll talk about all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released throughout the past work week. We’ll start first by going in detail with our favorite released, then we’ll outline all of the rest afterwards.

* TimeMover is a fabulous new jailbreak tweak that helps you customize the look and feel of your Lock screen. It lets you take that large time display and move it, re-size it, and rotate it any way you’d like.
* It can be great for aligning the clock to go along with your wallpaper, so it gives that “Hollywood” sign-like appeal you see in our examples above. Of course, if you want, you can go crazy with it and come up with your own style, as the tweak supports multitouch for customizing the clock.
* It includes features for hiding certain things from the Lock screen to reduce conflicts and more. If you’re interested in learning more about TimeMover and how it works, read our full review.

* SocialDownloader is a handy new tweak that lets you download media and videos from a host of different social networking apps.
* If you’ve ever stumbled upon a video, GIF, or other image that you wish you could save from an app or from its embedded Stories feature, only to find that the app doesn’t let you do that, then this tweak is going to be your best friend.
* You can learn more about the various apps it supports and how to download media in those apps in our full review.

* Apace is a tweak that brings new features to the Control Center and Lock screen’s Now Playing interface for Spotify and Deezer users.
* The tweak adds new features for adding music to your existing playlists or collections right to the interface, and you can even navigate those playlists thanks to APIs that Spotify makes available to developers.
* Along with the useful functionality, Apace comes with a slew of UI-theming features, which include the ability to change certain icons around and choose a preferred style.
