* Now that the iPhone 5 launch has come and gone, it’s time for Apple to start spreading the word about its new handset to the general public. And what better way to do that, then with new TV spots?
* Four new TV ads have appeared on Apple’s website tonight that highlight its latest smartphone and its features like a larger display, its new Panoramic camera mode, and its slimmer profile…
* Thumbs

* Cheese

* Physics

* Ears

* The commercials themselves are classic Apple. They focus on the device, in this case the iPhone 5, and how its features can benefit the consumer. For example, “Thumbs” shows the convenience of one-handed operation, and “Cheese” shows the advantage of being able to take panoramic photos on the go.
* It’ll be interesting to see if Apple can maintain the high level of demand for its handset that’ve we’ve seen over the past week. And these ads, for better or worse, will play a major role in making that happen.
* What do you think of the new iPhone 5 spots?
