title: Unfold 2.0 now available for free on Cydia
---
* Lost amidst yesterday’s well warranted hype for the iPhone 5, was the release of Unfold 2.0 — a jailbreak tweak available on Cydia.
* Unfold 2.0 allows for an accordion unlock style, in either a horizontal or vertical direction. It can be had for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Watch the video, and let us know what you think.
