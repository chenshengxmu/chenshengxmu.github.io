* This is pretty interesting. Hot on the heels of rumors that Apple is looking to get into the streaming music space, a new report popped up late last night alleging that Google too is working on a service of its own.
* Citing ‘people familiar with the matter,’ The Wall Street Journal is claiming that the search giant’s Android unit has been negotiating with music companies to start a paid subscription music streaming service…
* The WSJ’s Ethan Smith and Amir Efrati with the scoop:
* “Google Inc.’s GOOG +0.53% Android unit has been negotiating with music companies to start a paid subscription music-streaming service akin to Spotify AB, according to people familiar with the matter.
* Separately, Google’s YouTube video website is trying to obtain licenses from music labels to start a paid subscription service for music videos and potentially also for audio-only songs, these people said.”
* The two reporters also reaffirm that Apple is on a similar quest, negotiating with labels in an effort to secure music licenses for a Pandora-like service.
* “The music-streaming market is getting more crowded. Apple has been in talks to license music for a custom-radio service similar to the popular one operated byPandora Media Inc., P +2.98% people familiar with the matter have said. “
* Apple has long been rumored to be developing a subscription music service, though the latest reports from Bloomberg and The New York Times say that it could finally materialize into something by the end of the year.
* This would be yet another area in which Apple and Google would go head-to-head. They already do so in smartphones, tablets, computers, and even in the content space with stores for music, movies, books and apps.
* And it’ll be interesting to see who gets there first, and what they bring to the table. You know, the space isn’t exactly empty with long-time players like Spotify, Rdio, and Pandora wielding user bases in the tens of millions.
* What could these two tech giants offer that the others can’t? Lower pricing? Better integration into iOS or Android? What do you think?
