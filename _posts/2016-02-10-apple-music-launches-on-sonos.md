* As of today, owners of Sonos systems around the world can stream Apple Music directly through their wireless speaker hardware, the company announced. Anyone with an Apple Music subscription, or even a free trial, can stream any song from Apple’s catalog to their Sonos speakers.
* Just choose Add Music Service in Sonos’s companion iPhone app, scroll down to the Apple Music icon and log into your account.
* “The feedback from Apple Music members on Sonos during the beta period has been great,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services.
* “Songs plus Apple Music provides an amazing listening experience at home—and we’re excited to offer it to all Sonos customers.”
* In a blog post, Sonos said its own study found that families who listened to Apple Music in their home through their Sonos speakers spent as much as 67 percent more time together and even ate together more often.
