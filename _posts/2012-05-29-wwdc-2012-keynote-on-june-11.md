* Looks like there will be a keynote at this year’s WWDC. According to the official schedule, the Cupertino, California-headquartered gadget designer will officially hold the keynote talk on Monday, June 11, 2012, when the annual developers pilgrimage is slated to kick off…
* The Verge has the story:
* Apple has just published the full schedule for WWDC and along with it the news that the keynote will be on Monday, June 11th. We’ll update with more details as we get them.
* The company did not announce the keynote via a press release, according to their PR site.
* However, AllThingsD’s John Packowski spotted a keynote mention in the official WWDC schedule just posted this morning.
* “This year that eagerly anticipated address will occur on Monday June 11 at 10 AM”, Packowski writes.
* The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple concurs, saying the keynote will be held at 10:00 am on Monday, June 11, at Moscone West, per Apple’s invitation sent out to the press earlier this morning.
* If history is an indication, the high-profile keynote talk should at the least host CEO Tim Cook, marketing honcho Phil Schiller and, of course, the powerful head of the iOS platform, Scott Forstall.
* We’re watching Apple’s PR website for any news of keynote speakers and will updated the article accordingly.
* As you know, the official WWDC schedule went live this morning on Apple’s website and the company launched the official WWDC 2012 app for the iPhone and iPad.
