* The inaugural episode of “Planet of the Apps”, Apple’s original show about apps and their creators, is premiering tonight at 9PM Pacific Time, midnight Eastern Time on Apple Music. Apple today released a new trailer for ”Planet of the Apps” on its official YouTube channel.
* The show will be streamed free to all Apple Music members, Reuters reported Wednesday.
* “The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet software and Services. “Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what’s involved. This really shows how that’s possible.”
* Apple will promote the show on its homepage, in iTunes and elsewhere.
* “All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another,” Cue said.
* The first episode is also available free for a limited time via planetoftheapps.com. Apple encourages customers to join Apple Music to get new episodes every Tuesday.
* Here’s the trailer.
* From the video’s description:
* Apple Music presents Planet of the Apps, a groundbreaking new series that gives aspiring app creators the opportunity of a lifetime to work with entrepreneur advisors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Will.i.am.
* Under the close guidance of one advisor mentor, each concept goes through an intense incubation period—all in preparation for a real-life, high-stakes pitch to Lightspeed Venture Partners. Will they get funding or will they flounder?
* Everything is on the line for these app creators and their million dollar ideas.
* As mentioned, the first episode is available free for a limited time via the official website.
