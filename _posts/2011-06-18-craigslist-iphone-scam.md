* With so many look-a-likes and scams out there, a person has to be pretty careful when shopping online for an iDevice. Before purchasing any type of high-end electronic device, you always want to ask for the serial number to check and see if it’s been stolen, or if it’s even real.
* The police of Morrow City, Georgia recently apprehended 2 suspects for using a popular website to sell imitation iPhones and empty iPad boxes for cash. The two culprits were picked up last Thursday in the process of selling 2 fake iPhones for a total of $400…
* The suspects are accused of using Craigslist to rob folks of their money by offering iPhones and other Apple products at a discounted rate. The pair used everything from imitation iPhones, to floor tiles in iPad boxes to scam their victims and then conveniently disappeared.
* The duo were finally caught last week when authorities responded to a disturbance in a local mall parking lot. Apparently, a victim finally decided to check the merchandise before driving off. When the police arrived to the scene he was on top of the suspect’s car demanding his money back.
* The two 40 year-olds are currently in jail facing felony counts of theft by deception and multiple counts of trademark counterfeiting. I can’t believe they were able to get away with this in this first place. Why wouldn’t you ask to see the product before handing over the money?
* How do your Craigslist transactions go down?
