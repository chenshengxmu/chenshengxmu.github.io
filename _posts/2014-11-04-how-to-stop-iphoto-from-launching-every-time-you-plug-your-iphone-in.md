* If there is one thing that I very much dislike in my workflows, it’s processes that automatically start without my consent or prior agreement. The latest culprit to date is iPhoto, which automatically launches every single time I plug my iPhone in my computer. I’m not sure if this is iPhoto default’s behavior, or if I accidentally triggered this annoying feature, but fortunately there is a quick and easy way to stop this from happening again.
* Just like most Mac apps, it’s all in the Preferences.
* Step 1: Open iPhoto.
* Step 2: In the Menu bar, go to iPhoto > Preferences…
* Step 3: For the “Connecting camera opens” option, make sure to select “No application.”
* Step 4: Close the Preferences window.
* From now on, every time you plug your iPhone or iPad in your computer, iPhoto or no other application will launch.
