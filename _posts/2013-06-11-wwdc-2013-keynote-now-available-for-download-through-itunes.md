* Shortly following its live-streamed WWDC keynote talk yesterday, Apple has posted a streamable replay to their home page.
* I like to keep those keynotes handy for offline viewing, but saving a video stream to a computer is unfortunately a mess which involves too much trickery without guarantees for success.
* Luckily, Apple has catered to the archivist in us by making the entire presentation available for download through iTunes…
* The keynote video is available via the Apple Keynotes HD podcast on iTunes. You can also search for it by name (‘Apple WWDC 2013 Keynote Address’) in Apple’s own Podcast app or third-party software such as Instacast.
* The 2.96GB file will take some time downloading so you may want to fix yourself a cup of coffee, depending on how fast your Internet connection is. Typically, you should be able to download it in under an hour if you have at least a 10Mbps broadband connection.
* If you haven’t seen the keynote yet, sit back, relax, grab some popcorn and watch Apple’s boss Tim Cook and his team present iTunes Radio, iOS 7, OS X Mavericks, a next-generation Mac Pro and the updated MacBook Air.
* Oh, and you should block out the next two hours because the entire presentation runs one hour and 58 minutes long.
* Have fun!
