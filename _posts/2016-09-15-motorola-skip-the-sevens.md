* Remember Motorola? Yes, they’re still in the business and some of the handsets they make come with cool features, like quick customization modules that snap onto a phone using integrated magnets to add features like powerful speakers, external battery packs and so forth. It also made the first Android handset with a special low-power chip which made possible an always-listening “OK Google” mode.
* With the iPhone 7 sales about to kick off, the Lenovo-owned company is now telling customers to “skip the sevens” and has produced a video in which supposedly genuine Apple fans express their disappointment with incremental iPhone 7 improvements like “a little better camera” and “a little faster processor”.
* What happens next is a typical marketing crap.
* According to Motorola, smartphone innovation “has stalled” because leading brands are “focused on incremental product improvements” such as display sizes increase “by fractions of an inch”, cameras change “by a few megapixels” and so forth.
* In a not so subtle dig at Apple, Motorola says consumers often have to “wait two more years for the next big thing.” In the video, iPhone fans are shown a device they’re told was an iPhone prototype. As you can imagine, they go on gushing about how innovative it is before being told they were actually looking at a Moto Z handset.
* The video concludes with a tagline saying, “You can make announcements or you can break new ground”, and here it is.
* Moto Mods is the “first real change for smartphones,” says Motorola:
* Moto Mods are interchangeable backs that snap onto your Moto Z Droid, instantly transforming it into an entirely new device that does what no other phone can do. Like turn it into a movie projector, a boombox, or a battery powerhouse. The possibilities are practically endless. Moto Mods magnetically snap onto your phone, seamlessly becoming one with it. And they’re easy to swap whenever inspiration strikes.
* Motorola made similar digs at Apple in the past, but I don’t think they’re fooling anyone as these are anything but focus groups.
* It’s an insult to the brain to suggest iPhone fans would be stupid enough to mistaken a Motorola device for an iPhone 7. I mean, who in their right mind would believe that Motorola would somehow be in possession of an iPhone 7 prototype?
