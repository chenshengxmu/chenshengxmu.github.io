* It’s that time of year again. The days are getting shorter, preseason football has commenced, and children are starting, or will soon be starting, school again.
* So naturally, Rovio has released its Back to School update for Angry Birds Seasons. The update includes 20 new schoolyard levels, and (gasp!) a new bird…
* Meet the Pink Bird, the newest addition to the Angry Birds flock:
* As you’ve probably guessed by now, the Pink Bird’s special talent is her ability to blow bubbles. And she can use these bubbles to drop boulders and other objects on the pigs, and tip over structures.
* In addition to the new bird, the update also includes 20 brand new schoolyard levels and new props such as apples, school supplies and — well, you get the idea.
* If you already own Angry Birds Seasons, the update is free. But if you don’t, and you’d like to give it a whirl, you can find the full game in the App Store for $0.99.
* What do you think of the Back to School update?
