* Apple’s iPhone 3GS is still proving to be popular after being on the market for over two years.
* New numbers coming from the notoriously questionable DigiTimes suggest that Apple could see its iPhone 3GS production top the 2 millon mark during the fourth quarter of 2011. Those are stellar figures for a handset that is not one, but two generations old.
* The news comes as further reports claim Apple is set to sell around 30 million iPhones during the holiday season…
* “…production of iPhone 3GS has continued steadily with the volume likely to reach two million units in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 1.4-1.6 million units in the first quarter of 2012.”
* While the very strong demand for the new iPhone 4S will be partly to thank for those mind-boggling numbers, the impact of the entry-level iPhone 3GS and 8GB iPhone 4 should not be underplayed.
* In a market that is flooded with cheap Android smartphones, Apple’s presence at such a low price point (about $1) is crucial to the growth of the platform as a whole. Yes, selling premium handsets is all well and good, but it is at the lower end of the scale where the really big numbers start to rack up.
* Which iPhone was your most recent purchase, and why? We’d love to know if you picked up a free iPhone 3GS recently, or whether the 8GB iPhone 4 was the sweet spot for you.
