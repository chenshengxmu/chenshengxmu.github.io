* Apple on Tuesday seeded the first betas of iOS 10.3.3, watchOS 3.2.3, tvOS 10.2.2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Registered developers can download the new releases via each platform’s respective over-the-air mechanism, or via Apple’s dev portal.
* It’s not yet clear what changes are included in these updates, but given their version numbers, it’s likely they’re focused on security fixes and other under-the-hood improvements. We will let you know if anything more significant is discovered.
* The betas do come at an interesting time—24 hours after the release of public updates for each OS, and just a few weeks ahead of WWDC, where Apple is expected to show off previews of the next major versions of iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS.
