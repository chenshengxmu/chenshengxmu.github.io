* One way to conserve power on your iPhone when the battery level gets uncomfortably low is to turn on the built-in Low Power Mode. This feature reduces power consumption on your iPhone by doing things like reducing your screen brightness, slashing background tasks, and making your iPhone fall asleep faster, among other things.
* On the other hand, iOS doesn’t kick itself into Low Power Mode automatically until you reach at staggeringly-low 20% of your battery life. By that point, you’re already grasping at straws. That’s why iFlames released a new free jailbreak tweak called Low Power Modder in Cydia.
* This tweak essentially allows you to configure a custom battery level at which Low Power Mode will toggle on automatically on your iPhone. If you feel like the default 20% threshold is pushing it, like I do, then you might opt to start saving power when your battery hits around 50% or so.
* Low Power Modder also lets you choose when Low Power Mode turns off when your device is charging. It usually turns off automatically when your device reaches around 80% charge or higher. With this tweak, on the other hand, you can configure Low Power Mode remain on until you’re at 90%, or even 100%, as it can help your device to charge faster by lowering power usage as the device charges to its fullest.
* Low Power Modder will add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand, as well as configure your Low Power Mode toggling thresholds:

* The tweak is essentially all automatic after you’ve set your configurations, so you’ll never have to toggle Low Power Mode on manually ever again just because you hate that Apple makes you wait until 20% for automatic Low Power Mode. Personally, I think this is a setting Apple should include in iOS by default, but of course when you’re not jailbroken, what Apple says goes.
* If you’re interested in giving Low Power Modder a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 iPhones; iPads and iPod touches do not feature Low Power Mode, so they are not supported.
