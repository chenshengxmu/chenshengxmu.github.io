* When you think the drama is almost over, some good ol’ rumors show up, throwing yet a little more oil on the fire. According to BGR and their insider ninjas, Apple has absolutely no plan of ever releasing the white iPhone 4.
* The plan is actually to delay the White iPhone 4 again in the Spring, which would inevitably lead us to an iPhone 5 release…
* Our source hypothesizes another “delay” communicated around March leading us into an iPhone 5 release time-frame in June / July. Something interesting is that manufacturing sources our contact has are keeping quiet on the matter, not confirming that this was in fact a manufacturing issue at this point, but that there might be something else going on behind the scenes.
* HA! Something going on behind the scenes? Like what? A Verizon iPhone?
* No matter what’s going on, I think Apple should get its s**t together and communicate about what’s really going on. Postponing a product release every other month is amateurish at best.
* What’s your take on this situation?
