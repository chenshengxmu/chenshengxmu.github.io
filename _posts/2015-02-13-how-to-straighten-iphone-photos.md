* If you look at my Instagram account, you’ll clearly see a similarity to a majority of my shots: they usually feature some straight lines, generally the line of the horizon. I’m kind of obsessed with straight lines, because, well, I guess I’m just OCD like that. The problem is all photos aren’t shot perfectly straight, and more often than not, you’ll have to manually straighten them to get them leveled to your liking.
* Straightening a photo isn’t a pro tip by any means, but the feature isn’t necessarily very obvious either, hence this quick tip on how to straighten a photo on iPhone.
* Although this post shows iPhone screenshots, the process is exactly the same on iPad.
* Step 1: Launch the Photos app and select the photo you want to straighten.
* Step 2: At the bottom of the screen, tap the Edit button.

* Step 3: At the bottom of the screen, tap the crop icon located to the right of the Cancel button. This will bring up the cropping and straightening controls.

* Step 4: Directly under the photo, place your finger on the dial and drag it left or right to adjust the leveling. You’ll notice a grid will appear on top of the photo to help you properly adjust it to your liking.
* Step 5: Once it is straight, simply tap the Done button and your edits will be saved.
