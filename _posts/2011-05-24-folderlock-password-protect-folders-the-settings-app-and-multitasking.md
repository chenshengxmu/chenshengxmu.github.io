* It seems like the gears of the underground iOS development have been rapidly turning for the past month. There has been a steady flow of new and innovative tweaks and applications over the last several weeks, and it doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon.
* FolderLock, developed by Andrea Oliva, just went live in the BigBoss repo. The new jailbreak app will allow you to password protect almost everything in iOS, from folders to the Settings app. 
* There are dozens of reasons why you would want to password protect folders and other applications, whether it be adult content or other private information. Though there are already utilities available with similar features, FolderLock does bring some new options to the table.
* You can put a password prompt on the Settings app, as well as iOS features like Spotlight and the multitasking bar. It would be convenient to lock such areas down to obstruct prying eyes, in the event you let a friend or young one use your iPhone.
* The utility doesn’t include a separate home screen icon, just navigate to the Settings app to change FolderLock’s parameters. You can enable or disable FolderLock, as well as choose which apps you want locked via password.

* Even though it’s a brand new application, a few issues have already been noted. If you lock your Settings app and forget the password, it can be quite a headache to gain access back.
* It’s also important to note that the Spotlight security feature doesn’t block searches or results. You are only prompted for a password if you try to access one of the search results.
* If you have sensitive information on your iPhone or frequently give it to others to use, you’ll certainly want to check out FolderLock. It is now available in the Cydia Store for $1.59.
* Have you tried FolderLock yet? What app or tweak do you use to lock down your iPhone?
