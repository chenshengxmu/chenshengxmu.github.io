* Apple released the second betas of iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 on Monday and in them, it included its new TV app. The company introduced the new app at its ‘hello again’ Mac event last month, saying they believe it’s going to “completely change how you watch TV.”
* TV is essentially a television guide that helps you find and discover available content. So after using Single Sign-On to login with your cable credentials, the app will populate with movies, TV shows and live events, with a focus on stuff you might be interested in.

* Tapping on a movie or show will automatically launch its respective app, and begin playing your selected title. So for example, clicking on The Walking Dead would launch you into the AMC app, assuming that you have it installed and are authorized to view full episodes.

* The app is not fully-functional yet, and support is extremely limited. It’s only available in the US, works with only a handful of service providers, and does not include data from some services like Netflix. Apple says the TV app will be ready to launch in December.
