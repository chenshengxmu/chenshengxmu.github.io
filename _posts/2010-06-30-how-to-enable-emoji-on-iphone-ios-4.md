* Step 1: Download this free app from the App Store.
* Step 2: Launch the app and tap “ok, let’s do this”.
* Step 3: Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > International Keyboard > Add New Keyboard > Emoji.
* Step 4: Reboot your iPhone.
* You can now get emoji icons on your iPhone. To bring up the emoji keyboard, launch your Notes.app and tap the little “globe” icon next to the space key.
* If you send an email containing emoji icons, the person you send the email to must have emoji enabled too. For some reason, I wasn’t able to use emoji icons in the Email.app. It worked great for notes though.
* How is it working for you?
