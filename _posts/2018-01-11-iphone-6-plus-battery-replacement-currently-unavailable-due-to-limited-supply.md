* Apple’s discounted program lets iPhone 6/6s/SE owners replace their device’s battery for just $29 (limited to one repair per iPhone) instead of $79, regardless of its condition, but iPhone 6 Plus owners looking to take advantage of the lower fee will need to wait a few months.
* An internal document distributed to Apple’s retail stores and Authorized Service Providers this week, seen by MacRumors, acknowledges that iPhone 6 Plus replacement batteries are in short supply and won’t be available until late March to early April in the US and other regions.
* The company wrote in internal documentation that lead times may vary in some regions, including the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Russia and Turkey.
* But what about batteries for other models?
* From the article:
* Apple’s internal document quotes a shorter wait of approximately two weeks for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s Plus battery replacements and adds that batteries for all other models like iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone SE are expected to be available without extended delays in most countries.
* A reliable source at an Apple Authorized Service Provider indicated that they recently received a package with dozens of replacement batteries, the majority of which were for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models.
* Because availability of iPhone batteries varies by location, call your local Apple store before bringing in your device for a battery replacement service. Another option: check with your favorite Authorized Service Provider to see if they have spare batteries in stock.
* Apple’s battery replacement fee will return to its normal level ($79) on December 31, 2018.
