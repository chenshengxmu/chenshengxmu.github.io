* Don’t expect the Apple Car to start hitting stores anytime soon, says Tim Cook. During Apple’s annual shareholders meeting on Friday, the CEO responded to a question regarding the rumored vehicle, suggesting the project is far from launching.
* Business Insider has Cook’s full response from the Q&A session: “Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve it was so exciting, you weren’t sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.”
* Of course, this isn’t a major surprise. Every report we’ve seen regarding Project Titan has indicated that it wouldn’t be ready for a few years. But it’s interesting that Cook continues to not only not deny the car, but almost seems to revel in teasing it.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the story, Apple has reportedly assembled a team of engineers and experts from the auto industry to build an electric car. It’s believed to be fairly far along on the project, with plans to launch by 2020.
