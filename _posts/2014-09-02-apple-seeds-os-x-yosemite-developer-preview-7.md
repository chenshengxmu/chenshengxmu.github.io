* Coming two weeks and a day after its last Developer Preview release, Apple has released the seventh OS X Yosemite beta to developers.
* The update, version 7 1.0, is available for download to users currently running DP 6 in the Mac App Store, and to developers in Apple’s online developer center. Also available for download is Yosemite Recovery Update 2.0. The previous beta introduced several new icons in System Preferences, as well as several app icons and new wallpapers.
* We’re installing the developer preview now and will be updating this post with our findings. If you discover anything new, please email us the details with screenshots at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a comment below!
