* There comes a time when you need to jot something down really quick, and that’s where the inconvenience of having to unlock your handset gets in the way.
* A new jailbreak tweak dubbed Notepad comes to the rescue by offering a Lock screen-based means of writing notes to yourself. It’s always available to you whether you’ve saved a note or not, so you can quickly jot things down without dealing with passcodes and biometric authentication methods.
* If you want to learn more about Notepad and how it works, then you can check out our full review in which we go in-depth.
