* Unless you’ve been sleeping under a rock the whole day, you probably know that iPhone 5 shipping times have dramatically been pushed back to up to 2-3 weeks, both on the online Apple store and at most carriers – just a mere hour or two after Cupertino with its partners began processing orders. Commenting on the situation, a spokesperson for the company acknowledged pent-up demand for the device, choosing interesting wording from the company’s familiarly colloquial yet effective vocabulary…
* Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris told John Paczkowski of AllThingsD via email that the company was taken aback by strong response to its new handset:
* Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible. We’ve been completely blown away by the customer response.
* So much about ‘disappointing’ iPhone 5 launch.
* Off topic: ‘blown away’ gets used a lot in Apple executives’ vocabulary (I’m guilty of this, too).
* I still remember the iPhone 4S introduction last October when iOS boss Scott Forstall showed Jobsian knack for grammatically incorrect hyperbole.
* He was demoing Siri and at one point asked her, “Who are you?”, to which Siri replied, “I am a humble personal assistant”.
* Forstall then smiled at the audience, saying “that is absolutely blow-away”.
* I counted two occurrences of the “blow away” variants in Apple’s iPhone 4 promo clip.
* In fact, Forstall gets so often ‘blown away’ that he cannot find himself.
* Joking aside, we do not know how many units Apple set aside for pre-orders.
* The company usually keeps up to two weeks worth of iPhone inventory in the channel.
* As analyst are expecting sales of up to ten million iPhone 5 devices by the end of September (when Apple’s fiscal year 2012 ends), the company must have allocated 2-3 million units for pre-orders and 7-8 million for launch day (which is next Friday, September 21, beginning at 8am local time at Apple’s retail stores and via AT&T, Sprint and Verizon).
* It’s just my estimate and I could be easily wrong, of course.
* Something tells me Apple will want to brag about launch day sales via a press release.
* What do you think?
* How many iPhone 5 units were available for pre-orders worldwide?
