* YouTube’s app features custom reminders for when you’d like to take a break from watching.
* Do you lack self-control? Then you’re not surprised that YouTube is a major time-suck.
* It’s perfectly fine to go down YouTube’s rabbit hole every now and then. The world’s most-trafficked video site, once a clearinghouse for kitten videos, has become both a cultural phenomenon and a go-to platform for the next-generation of truly innovative video creators.
* And with its ever-improving recommendation engine, it’s all too easy to waste precious time on related videos that you didn’t really mean to watch but deemed too interesting to pass on.
* TUTORIAL: How to watch YouTube in HDR
* Thankfully, the mobile YouTube app includes optional “take a break” notification that will display a prompt when you’ve exceeded a specific amount of consecutive viewing time.
* To set up these alerts, do the following:
* 1) Launch the YouTube app on your iPhone or iPad.
* TIP: Be sure that you’re using YouTube for iOS version 13.18 or later.

* To see the version number of your copy of YouTube for iOS, open the app, tap your profile image, choose Settings then scroll all the way to the bottom of the page.
* 2) Tap your profile image in the upper-right corner.
* 3) Choose Settings from the list.
* 4) Tap the entry labeled “Remind me to take a break” at the top of the list.
* TIP: If you don’t see this option, that’s because Google has yet to launch it in your country so check back after a few days or weeks and be sure that you’re running an up-to-date version.
* 5) Choose how long until you get reminded.
* Your choices are:
* To watch YouTube uninterrupted, select Never.

* A few thing to keep in mind:
* I usually pick one of the built-in frequencies when I’m unwinding and watching YouTube late at night just to be sure I don’t end up watching UFO and conspiracy videos until dawn.
* As evidenced by the screenshot at the very top of this tutorial, the reminder automatically pauses your currently playing video as soon as it appears.

* As the screenshot top of post attests, when the alert appears you can tap either Dismiss if you’d like to cancel it and resume watching your video or Settings to go directly to the settings interface in case you’d like to turn the reminder off or edit its frequency.
* Google gives you other settings, too, designed to help cure your YouTube addiction.
* With scheduled digest, you can receive a daily digest notification rather than being inundated with multiple push notifications throughout the day every time someone posts a live stream, uploads a video or comments on one of your videos.

* Additionally, users can set the start and end times for when all YouTube notifications should be silenced. By default, the app silences all notifications between 10pm and 8am.
