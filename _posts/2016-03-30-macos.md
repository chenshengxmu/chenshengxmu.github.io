* OS X, the desktop operating system which powers the Mac—“it’s what makes a Mac a Mac,” says Apple—does not fit into the company’s current OS naming scheme that has already given us watchOS, tvOS and iOS, but that might be about to change.
* According to Portuguese-language site MacMagazine.com.br, developer Guilherme Rambo has discovered an interesting mention of ‘macOS’ in the “FUFlightViewController_macOS.nib” interface file within the FlightUtilities framework inside OS X code.
* What makes this even more interesting is the fact that the name of that file has changed in the latest OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 software update, indicating the next major revision to the Mac operating system, OS X 10.12, might be marketed as ‘macOS’.
* I think this change is logical and has been in the cards for some time now.
* In addition to iOS 10, tvOS 10 and watchOS 3, Apple should also preview OS X 10.12 with Siri for Mac and other improvements at this summer’s WWDC.
* With the tvOS, watchOS and iOS OC names, it would make a lot of sense to rebrand OS X as ‘macOS’ for the sake of consistency, don’t you think so?
