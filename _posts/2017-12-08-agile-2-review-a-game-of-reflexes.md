* There is something almost addicting about the subtle haptic vibration that comes from the iPhone’s Taptic Engine. It appeals to the same part of the brain as popping bubble wrap. Agile 2, from developer Ben McCarthy (of Obscura Camera), is a game of quickness for iPhone that uses the haptics of the iPhone to make it both mesmerizing, and addicting.
* Agile 2 uses a simple interface to create a welcoming, zen-like game. The “whack-a-mole” style gameplay is comprised of a white background and small dots that appear on screen. Your objective is to simply tap the dots before they darken and turn black.
* What makes tapping the dots in Agile 2 so much fun is the feedback when hitting each circle. With each tap, the Taptic engine fires off a short “pop,” like you’re popping the bubbles on a sheet of bubble wrap. Unlike bubble wrap, though, speed is key in Agile.

* In a game of Agile, things start off slowly, with a single spot on the screen at a time. As the round progresses and you hit more dots, they begin to appear faster and darken quicker. Don’t hit all the circles quick enough and the screen turns red, ending the game.
* Overall, gameplay is extremely simple, and each round typically lasts less than two minutes, making it a great way to pass the time waiting for an appointment or while in line at a coffee shop or store. At $1.99, Agile 2 may seem pricy for its simple design, but its use of haptics has made it one of my favorites recently.
* If you like the beauty of simplicity and get the same pleasure from popping bubble wrap as I do, Agile 2 is definitely worth checking out.
* Agile 2 is available for $1.99 in the App Store.
