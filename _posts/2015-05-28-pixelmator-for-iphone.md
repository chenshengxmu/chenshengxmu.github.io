* As promised, beginning today you can touch up photos, apply fancy effects to images and much more, using Pixelmator for iPhone. Available as a free update to Pixelmator for iPad, Pixelmator is now a universal app supporting any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.3 or later.
* A complete photo editing, painting and layer-based graphic design app for your iPhone, Pixelmator is every bit as powerful as its iPad edition.
* Not only does the app include the powerful Repair tool from the iPad edition, but also has some new features such as the new Distort tools and a brand new Clone tool which all take advantage of Apple’s Metal framework in iOS 8 for hardware-accelerated graphics.
* As a result, these new tools are incredibly fast and fluid as Metal removes the overhead of Open GL and gives developers close-to-the-metal access to the GPU.
* Pixelmator for iPhone includes all of the image effects and filters you’ve come to love in the iPad and Mac editions, such as advanced retouching tools for seamless removal of unwanted objects from images.

* You’ll love other cool features such as various blending modes, a painting tool for creating watercolor images, a color picker, an eyedropper, a text tool for adding custom text and much more.
* And yes, Pixelmator for iPhone supports layered Photoshop files and lets you add your own layers to create some really complex compositions.
* Here’s a quick video overview of Pixelmator for iPhone.
* A range of brushes are available in the Retouch menu for painting on images with your finger, adjusting image corrections and more. All told, you have more than a hundred brushes at your disposal, including a smear tool for softening edges.
* And with the app now available across Macs and iOS devices, Pixelmator for iPhone includes important platform integration features from both the iPad and Mac edition, like iCloud Drive, Handoff and a cool Extension which lets you take advantage of Pixelmator’s powerful image editing tools right inside the stock Photos app in iOS 8.
