* By now, most of you are likely familiar with the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Proview over the iPad trademark. Much of the dispute has unfolded in or around China, but in February the monitor-maker brought its fight Stateside.
* In the lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara California, Proview alleged that Apple committed fraud when it used a dummy corporation to purchase the iPad trademark, thus making the deal void. But this California judge doesn’t want to hear it…
* The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Judge Mark Pierce of the Superior Court of the State of California in Santa Clara County has approved a motion filed by Apple on May 4th to dismiss Proview’s lawsuit.
* “After proview took its legal case to the U.S., Apple argued for the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the parties had agreed to settle any legal disagreements in Hong Kong.
* Judge Pierce upheld that view, writing that Proview failed to provide evidence that the selection of Hong Kong was “unreasonable or unfair,” according to a copy of that order.”
* Of course, Proview can, and will, appeal this decision. So it’s not over yet. But for the time being, it looks like Apple’s iPad trademark troubles will remain on the Asian continent. And things are starting to improve on that front as well.
