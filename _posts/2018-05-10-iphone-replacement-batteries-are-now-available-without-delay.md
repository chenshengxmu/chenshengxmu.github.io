* Apple’s iPhone replacement batteries are temporarily down from $79 to $29 until the end of 2018, and the good news is that availability has finally improved.
* An internal memo distributed to Apple Stores and the company’s network of authorized service providers on April 27, obtained by MacRumors, confirms that “service inventory of all iPhone replacement batteries is now available without delay.”

* In other words, Apple’s own brick-and-mortar stores and its authorized service technicians are now able to order replacement iPhone batteries and receive them without facing extended shipping delays. However, as MacRumors points out, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every Apple Store or authorized repair shop will have supply available right away.
* Availability is likely to vary by store and region.
* The Cupertino company previously warned that replacement batteries for select iPhone models may be in short supply until late March or early April.
* If your iPhone has a worn-out battery and is running slow or restarting unexpectedly, replacing the battery will restore performance. With the discounted battery replacement program valid until December 31, 2018, you’re recommended to take advantage of Apple’s offer.
* The program is limited to one repair per iPhone.
* Discounted pricing is valid regardless of battery condition.
