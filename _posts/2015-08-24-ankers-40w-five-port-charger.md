* How many smartphones, tablets, and music players do you have in your household? Chances are, you have more than two. In some households, there are a lot more than that. Sometimes, it doesn’t seem like there are enough plugs to charge everyone’s gadgets.
* Anker makes a 40W five-port charger that features specially designed device recognition technology so it will charge different types of gadgets at their fullest speed all at the same time, and you only need one wall plug.
* The hub has an output of 40 watts with 8 amps of charge, which allows you to juice up multiple powerful devices at the same time. There are five USB ports so you can connect as many devices at once.
* It has a circuit limiter to protect you from overages. The PowerIQ technology recognizes how much juice each device needs and only sends that amount. Each port has a maximum 2.4A current, so you can easily charge an iPad Air. When not charging, the hub draws less than 0.5 watts of power from the wall. However, you can also disconnect it easily.
* The charger is about the size of a credit card (except much thicker, of course). So, it fits into your backpack or bag without taking up too much space.
* Anker’s 40W five-port charger is highly rated on Amazon with 4.5 out of five stars across more than 6,000 reviews. It is available for $26 and comes with an 18-month warranty.
