* T-Mobile CEO John Legere claims that his Uncarrier is now the third largest carrier in the United States, overtaking Sprint for the spot behind AT&T and Verizon. Legere had been predicting the overtaking of Sprint for sometime, and he finally made the claim it’s happened during T-Mobile’s earnings call Thursday afternoon.
* “I’ve been very gracious on this as the year ended and people were saying, ‘Hey, he predicted he was going to pass Sprint and he didn’t.’ Well, we did. That’s the gig.”
* Sprint and T-Mobile are both now at 55 million customers, however Legere claims that Sprint is using questionable tactics so that it can continue including inactive MVNO customers when reporting its customer base. He said that in the next quarter or two, things should become more evident that T-Mobile has topped Sprint.
* “Going into 2013, Sprint had 55 million customers. Going into ’14, they had 55 million customers. Going into this year, they have 55 million customers. In that period, they lost 3.3 million postpaid customers as well.”
* T-Mobile can thank its gain in customers from acquiring MetroPCS and its Uncarrier initiatives.
* With Legere leading the way, it has been trying to reshape the wireless industry by ending two-year contracts, and adding plans to allow customers to upgrade phones when they’d like, unlimited data, messages, and voice, and free data roaming in worldwide.
* What do you think of T-Mobile? I often hear the claim many people would switch if it wasn’t for the lack of stellar coverage in many areas.
