* According to well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple’s rumored brand-new Mac notebook model might include a Touch ID fingerprint scanner but not the Touch Bar feature.
* “We expect this new model to support Touch ID but it will not have the Touch Bar feature,” according to Kuo’s research note issue to clients Monday, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors. In other words, a full-out Touch Bar will remain exclusive to select 13- and 15-inch models of the 2016, 2017 and later MacBook Pro models.
* It’s not hard to see why Apple would prefer Touch ID over Touch Bar seeing how Touch Bar has yet to prove itself an indispensable feature. Moreover, Touch ID requires Apple-designed T-series cryptographic coprocessor for Mac notebooks (similar to a Secure Enclave in iPhones and iPads) to securely stored mathematical representations of your fingerprints.

* Aside from matching fingerprints, T-branded chips support other nice features.
* For instance a Mac with this chip is able to provide hardware-accelerated flash storage encryption and decryption functions to the system, on the fly, which makes everyday operations snappier. The chip also supports a number of other features, like added security for the web camera and more. If there’s going to be Touch ID in this new Mac notebook, expect an accompanying Apple T-branded chip, too.
* And with it, the new notebook should support “Hey Siri”.
* The new machine may replace the position currently occupied by the current 12-inch MacBook, Kuo wrote. In fact, over time it might even replace the existing MacBook series.
* A company called Everwin Precision is expected to be the main beneficiary of the new machine. As Kuo explained, this marks the first time Everwin will enter the Mac casing supply chain. Its shipments are projected to account for one-fifth of the new MacBook model’s parts.
* I’m certainly more than glad that Apple is building a new MacBook.

* Kuo’s latest predictions include 2018’s iPad Pros, new iPhones and more.
* I use a 2013 MacBook Air for my work. I’ve had no issues with it despite having only 4GB RAM. But connecting the computer to my 27-inch Apple Thunderbolt Display, or attempting to do crucial video work, sends the fans into overdrive and slows everything down.
* I fell in love with Apple’s ultra-sweet 12-inch notebook, but it’s slower than my Air by virtue of using slower Intel chips that don’t consume as much power as the Intel Core series in my Air.
* The result: the 12-inch MacBook is a great, portable machine foe browsing the web, checking email, posting on social media and stuff like that, but performance leaves a lot to be desired in heavy multitasking situations like I’m having on any given work day.
* I’ve been waiting for Intel’s future Core m chips to close the performance gap with my Air, but this has yet to happen. So here I am, typing this on my rusty old 2013 Air with a low resolution display. If that new MacBook is priced aggressively, runs faster than my Air and comes outfitted with a Retina screen, Apple can have my money.
* Thoughts on this new MacBook?
