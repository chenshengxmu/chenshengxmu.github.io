* One of the best ways to spice up the look of your iPhone is to don some new wallpaper. Wallpaper Cyclr is a jailbreak tweak that takes this basic premise and runs with it.
* If pulling in random wallpaper from Tumblr based on tags you assign sounds like a good idea you, then you’ll certainly want to take a look at Wallpaper Cyclr. This is a tweak that allows you to change up your wallpaper based on pre-set intervals, and it’s always a surprise as to what Wallpaper you acquire on your device.
* After installing Wallpaper Cyclr, you’ll need to head over to its preference panel in the Settings app. While there, you can add your own custom tags that will pull in photos based on the content of those tags. You can then setup an interval (between 1-12 hours) to pull in new wallpaper pertaining to those tags.
* Of course, if you’re not apt to wait the full interval cycle, you can manually recycle the wallpaper via the tweak’s settings as well. Whatever manner you go about the process, you’ll need to lock and then unlock your iOS device for the new wallpaper to take effect.
* I tried quiet a few different tags during my hands-on usage with Wallpaper Cyclr, and I was almost always surprised by the results. It really is one of those tweaks that’s completely random, as you have little to no idea what type of wallpaper will be chosen outside of the fact that it has been assigned to the tags specified on Tumblr.
* Although the wallpaper most likely won’t be very appealing looking, based on dimensions, resolution, quality, etc, I have to give Wallpaper Cyclr an ‘A’ for originality. If you want to try out something fun, original, and spontaneous, then check out Wallpaper Cyclr. You can download it for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. What do you think?
