* Coming soon after the release of OS X Yosemite in the Mac App Store, Apple has updated its iLife software suite, along with Aperture, to support Yosemite and many of the features it introduces.
* iMovie and GarageBand both received support for OS X Yosemite in the way of Mail Drop, but iMovie was the only one to gain a new coat of Yosemite paint, although GarageBand now has a new icon. iPhoto and Aperture appear to have been given only the necessary compatibility tweaks to patch Yosemite-related bugs, as Apple plans to drop support entirely for both apps early next year in favor of the upcoming Photos for Mac photo manager and editor.
* iMovie now supports iPhone and iPad screen recording clips captured with QuickTime, which can be used by developers to create app previews for the App Store. Also added are animated titles specifically designed for showcasing apps and the ability to export a video for use as an app preview in the App Store.
* You can purchase these apps or download their updates from the Mac App Store.
