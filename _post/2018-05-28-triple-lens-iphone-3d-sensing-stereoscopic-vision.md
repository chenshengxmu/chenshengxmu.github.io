* Apple’s rumored triple-lens iPhone, allegedly coming in 2019, may bring 3x optical zoom and advanced 3D sensing via stereoscopic vision, one analyst speculated Tuesday.
* That’s according to a research note from Deutsche Securities analyst Jialin Lu, mentioned in a Tuesday report from Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News (Google Translate).
* At least one of the phones scheduled for release in 2019 is, according to the machine-translated article, “expected to have twelve million pixels 6P anti-shock specifications.” Among other perks, a 6P lens provides true optical zoom and light field camera applications.
* The news outlet first mentioned a triple-lens iPhone last month. Having three lenses out the back would result in crisper long-exposure shots, better images in low-light conditions, as well as improved depth detection, portraiture photography and depth of field effects.
* Bloomberg was first to report last November that Apple would release a triple-lens iPhone model in 2019 with enhanced augmented reality features, such as accurate depth mapping and more reliable tracking, thanks to vastly improved 3D sensing.
* As the Cupertino technology giant is expected to keep iPhone X’s TrueDepth camera system, future iPhone models will likely sport both front and rear-facing 3D sensing capabilities.
* Having three 12-megapixel lenses will power new photography and camera features, Lu speculated, like stereoscopic vision and 3x optical zoom capabilities on an iPhone for the first time thanks to a longer focal length without a reduction in quality like digital zoom.
* For the comparison’s sake, Apple’s existing dual-lens smartphone models—iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X—feature 2x optical zoom.
* iPhone won’t be the first smartphone with three lenses on the back, though.
* That honor belongs to Huawei’s recently released P20 Pro device which comes outfitted with a triple-lens rear camera system comprised of a 40-megapixel lens, a 20-megapixel monochrome lens and an eight-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.
