* Finnish company Nokia has decided to sell the digital health and fitness accessory business it acquired in 2016 from Withings for $192 million back to Éric Carreel, who is the co-founder of the French health tracking company.
* Nokia says that the planned sale is part of its shift to become a business-to-business and licensing company. Even though Nokia rebranded Withings’ iPhone-compatible digital health accessories and fitness wearables, the entire Digital Health division managed to pull in just $62.4 million in revenue last year.

* The transaction is subject to terms agreed in the negotiations and completion of the information consultation with the Works Council of Nokia Technologies (France) SA.
* The deal is expected to close by the summer.
* Apple currently carries several Nokia-branded digital health accessories via its retail and online stores, including Nokia’s smart sale, thermometer and blood pressure monitor.
