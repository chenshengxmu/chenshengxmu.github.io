* SoundCloud, an online audio distribution platform, on Thursday issued a long-expected updated to its iOS client which has finally added support for the new iPhone resolutions so it no longer looks oddly scaled on your brand spanking new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. In addition to playlist creation and iPhone 6 support, SoundCloud 3.6 contains various bug fixes.
* With SoundCloud, it’s easy to find new and trending music from emerging and independent artists, musicians or just about anyone else. The service is home to some quality podcasts, comedy and news and packs in the Explore Trending Music and Trending Audio feeds to aid your content discovery needs.
* SoundCloud streams audio to your device over Wi-Fi or cellular data connection, lets you play, pause and skip tracks from the Lock screen and allows for anonymous listening — that is, you can play songs without creating an account (iPhone only).
* If you do want to become a registered SoundCloud users, the app removes the friction of signing up by supporting Facebook and Google+ accounts.
* SoundCloud 3.6 changelog:
* Note that the iPad edition hasn’t picked up the new features in today’s update.
* The 32.6-megabyte download requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download SoundCloud free in the App Store.
