* When Orpington, England resident Gail Davis tapped “install” to download Paper Glider, she got a free game. Unbeknownst to her, the install also yielded her a $10,000 iTunes gift card; the result of being the 10 billionth app downloaded in the history of the App Store.
* I guess you could say that Davis had impeccable timing. Unfortunately her timing skills didn’t carry over to an extremely timely phone call; one from Eddy Cue, Apple’s VP of iTunes.
* You see, Davis mistakenly perceived the phone call to be nothing more than a prank, so she hung up the phone…

* Davis’ Daughters, one of whom was actually responsible for downloading the app, were stunned at hearing of their mother’s folly. “The girls came down and said it wasn’t a prank,” Davis explains. “I had a moment of panic.”
* Fortunately, another executive from Apple attempted the call again, and this time Davis was well aware that it was indeed no joke.
* “The more I thought about it, the more I realized it was a genuine call,” she says. “The girls were getting quite tense. They never would have forgiven me. They would have held it against me for all eternity.”
* With $10,000 in iTunes purchases at their disposal, and two daughters being in their teens, I’d say that gift card should last, what, a good week?
