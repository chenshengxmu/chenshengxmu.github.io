* Apple likely disappointed spec-watchers everywhere when it announced today that it kept the camera on the iPhone 5s at 8-megapixels. This means that, on paper at least, the handset is inferior to those with 12, 13 and 41mp sensors.
* But as you’ll see in these sample photos, taken with an actual iPhone 5s, that’s just not the case. With its five-element Apple-designed lens, F2.2 aperture and 15% larger active sensor area, the 5s will hold its own among the best of them…
* Apple has posted the following photos on its website with the caption: Actual photos taken with the iPhone 5s. All of them look extremely sharp, and clear, to the point that it’s kind of hard to believe that they were shot with a smartphone.

* In addition to the aforementioned new features, the 5s camera houses several other improvements. It has a “True Tone” dual-LED flash that makes for better white balance and low-light photos. It has improved auto-focus with 15-zone matrix metering, and a new burst mode for capturing action shots.
* On the video side, there’s a new a new “Slo-Mo” mode, which is designed to capture 720p video at up to 120 frames per second with 3x live video zoom.
* So, what do you think of the 5s camera thus far?
