* Although the Halloween event might be over for Pokémon GO players, a new server-side update for the game is rolling out to all players that aims to invoke a resurgence in the game’s popularity.
* New daily bonuses will be given to players for performing certain tasks at least once per day, such as catching Pokémon and spinning PokéStop Photo Discs.
* In addition to the array of daily bonuses, players who are loyal enough to play every single day of the week will receive even larger bonuses for performing those same tasks all seven days of the week.

* According to Niantic, you can expect to receive the following for each achievement:
* Catching a Pokémon every day will earn the following bonus:
* Catching a Pokémon every day for 7 days straight will earn the following larger bonus:
* Visiting a PokéStop and spinning the Photo Disc every day will earn the following bonus:
* Visiting a PokéStop every day for 7 days straight will earn the following larger bonus:
* The daily bonuses reset each day for every player at 12 A.M. local time. In other words, if you happen to catch a Pokémon at any time on a Tuesday, your next available bonus will be on Wednesday at 12 A.M.
* Because the update is server-side, you won’t need to look for an update in the App Store. Instead, when you catch your first Pokémon of the day or spin at your first PokéStop, you should begin seeing your daily bonuses.
* If you’re not already playing Pokémon GO and want to get started, you can download it for free from the App Store.
* In other news, players will no longer receive Pidgeys or Rattatas from eggs while hatching them, and Eevees will now only hatch from 5 km eggs.
