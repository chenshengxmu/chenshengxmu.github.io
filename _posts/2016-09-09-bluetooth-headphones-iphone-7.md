* Now that you’ve ordered your iPhone 7 and picked out a case, it’s time to think about getting another accessory: Bluetooth headphones. With Apple choosing to remove the 3.5mm jack from its latest handset, wireless headphones make the perfect companion for your new gadget.
* As for which model to get, Apple’s just-announced AirPods look pretty cool. But between their steep $160 price tag and unproven real-world performance, we think there are some better options out there. Here is a list of 7 great pairs of Bluetooth headphones for your new iPhone 7.

* If you’re looking for the absolute cheapest pair of Bluetooth earbuds, here you go. Well, I’m sure there are cheaper sets out there, but this is about as cheap as you want to go. Aukey is a highly regarded name brand in the mobile accessory space, and its sport earbuds get respectable reviews on Amazon. Features include Bluetooth 4.1 support, in-line volume controls, built-in microphone for answering phone calls, ear hooks for better fit, 7 hours of talk time and a 24-month warranty.
* You can buy these Aukey Bluetooth Sport earbuds for $23.

* If you’d prefer over-the-ear Bluetooth headphones, but still want to keep the price down, the BTH3s from Photive are a great choice. This is another one of those brands that you may not have heard of, but has a great reputation online. These headphones charge quickly, last for up to 12 hours, have built-in playback controls and microphone, and offer a comfortable fit. Plus, a nice hard travel case is included for free. You can’t beat that!
* You can buy these Photive Over-The-Ear Bluetooth headphones for $50.

* If we had a “Best Value” or “Editor’s Choice” selection in this post, it would be the Epic2s from JLab Audio. You really just get a lot of bang for your buck here: best-in-class playtime of up to 12 hours, IPX5-rated sweat and splash proofing, Memory Wire tech for more durability, and titanium over-ear hooks and gel tips for long-lasting comfort. Of course the headphones also sound great, and they come with a hard travel case.

* Jaybird has made a name for itself in the sport earbud space, and the X2s are its latest hit. These sport Bluetooth headphones feature 8 hours of playback, an inline microphone, and built-in playback controls. The sound is impressive for Bluetooth earbuds, and Jaybird includes a “lifetime” sweat-proof warranty. Also in the package are memory foam ear tips, secure-fit ear fins, charging cable, and silicon sport carrying case.

* These Plantronics BackBeat headphones have a respectable 4 star rating on Amazon, but we’re including them here more for their behind-the-head design—some users find this design more comfortable and stable during workouts. The BackBeat Fits are also waterproof, flexible, and have a solid battery life providing up to 8 hours of playback. In the box you get the charging cable, and a smartphone armband—which has a pocket that can store the BackBeat headphones when folded.
* You can buy these Plantronics BackBeat Fit headphones for $76.

* If price really isn’t a factor for you, and you want on-ear headphones, you’re going to want to look at the Beats Solo2s. True, Beats has gotten a bad wrap for being over-priced, but most will agree that Solo2 headphones are a solid buy. They look great, sound great, and feature 12-hour battery life. Other features include built-on Mic and an included carrying case. Plus, how good would the black Solo2s look with your new Black or Jet Black iPhone 7?
* You can buy the Beats Solo2 Bluetooth headphones for $200.
