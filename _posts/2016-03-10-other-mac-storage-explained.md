* We recently detailed ‘Other’ iOS storage, an iTunes-reported section that includes various caches and temporary system files on you iPhone, iPod touch and iPad along with device settings, high-quality Siri and Voice Over voices and other system data.
* Not many people know that OS X reports ‘Other’ storage on Macs, too. Unlike its iOS counterpart, the ‘Other’ Mac storage basically counts non-media files that don’t fit any other category.
* In addition, files not recognized by Spotlight are classed as ‘Other’ storage, among other items. Here’s precisely what files are included in the ‘Other’ storage section, how to see its size, why your disk’s used space appears as ‘Other’ storage when you startup up your Mac in Safe Mode and more.
* As mentioned, the ‘Other’ storage category is comprised of all the files that are not audio files, movies, photos, apps or Time Machine backups.
* Examples of files that may be calculated as ‘Other’ storage include:
* That’s a pretty broad definition of the ‘Other’ category so it is no surprise that the size of your Mac’s ‘Other’ storage will typically appear so large.
* Tip: Clean up Downloads folder to regain storage space on Mac
* To check out the size of your ‘Other’ Mac storage, do the following:
* 1) Click the About This Mac option in the Apple menu on your computer.
* 2) In the About This Mac window, click the Storage tab. You will see a visual estimate of how much space certain files are using on each of your drives.

* The actual reported categories are determined by Spotlight and as such may vary from one person’s Mac to another person’s Mac. It’s also important to note that this is a very rough breakdown of the data on your drives.
* Tip: More detailed storage information for startup drives, CD/DVD media, USB thumb drives and other connected volumes is available by clicking the System Report button in the About This Mac window.

* Now click the Storage section in the lefthand column to display storage information. This window gives you an accurate depiction of your free/used space, but won’t categorize storage space, or ‘Other’ storage for that matter.

* Your storage breakdown in the About This Mac window treats free space differently than the Finder or what you’d normally get through the Finder’s Get Info window. On Mac notebooks that use Time Machine, for example, OS X saves temporary local snapshots that take up free storage space.
* However, OS X counts these local snapshots as temporary files that will get automatically deleted, if necessary—that’s why the amount of free space in the About This Mac window differs than what the Finder reports.
* In other words, both the Finder and Get Info treat local Time Machine snapshots as free space, unlike the Disk Utility app, for example.
* Furthermore, excluding folders from Spotlight indexing in System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy might make the reported ‘Other’ space even less accurate.
* Users should keep in mind that the Finder doesn’t default to showing hidden files or the system Library folder. In addition, one OS X user account cannot see the accurate size of another user’s Home folder for security reasons.
* When your Mac starts up in Safe Mode (hold the Shift (⇧) key after the startup chime), OS X counts files in ‘Other’ storage differently than when you boot normally.

* Specifically, the About This Mac window in Safe Mode simply displays all used space as ‘Other’. This is expected behavior because Safe Mode skips loading startup items and other software components and only gives you essential drivers and apps.

* Because all software features are not available when your Mac is started in Safe Mode, the About This Mac window is unable to, or doesn’t attempt to categorize disk space.
