* Wifi Passwords is a new jailbreak application that displays all the wifi passwords you have entered on your iPhone when connecting to secure networks.
* Let’s say you’re at your favorite coffee shop. You brought your iPad for the first time and you don’t know the wifi password, but you did enter the password on your iPhone before. Well, instead of asking the password to an employee, just launch Wifi Passwords and find out what the password for this coffee shop network is… 
* I find this app really useful. And best of all, it’s free! Try it and let us know what you think.
