* As we previously reported, RedSn0w received a massive update with its 0.9.9b1 iteration, released a few days ago.
* This latest version of RedSn0w is a huge step in the right direction for the iPhone Dev Team, as it includes features like firmware fetching and caching, auto-detection from DFU mode, and SHSH blob management.
* We’re very excited about the future of RedSn0w, but admittedly, all of the new fangled features can be a bit confusing. For this reason, we’ve created a brief video walkthrough that touches on some of the new areas of RedSnow…
* New features aside, if you’re just looking to jailbreak your iOS device, it’s even easier to do so with RedSn0w 0.9.9b1.
* No longer do you have to specify an IPSW firmware file, no longer do you have to concern yourself with downloading the right version of RedSn0w that’s compatible with the specific firmware running on your device — including the iOS 5 betas.
* As if that wasn’t enough, RedSn0w 0.9.9b1 also includes features from TinyUmbrella, such as the ability to manage SHSH blobs, and to kick your device out of recovery mode.

* It seems to me that since Apple is simplifying many features with iOS 5, e.g. delta firmware updates, the Dev Team felt they needed to work on simplifying their flagship jailbreak tool as well.
* The result is a much needed upgrade to previous versions of RedSn0w, which will only get better as time goes on. I’m wholeheartedly looking forward to what the Dev Team has in store for us with future upgrades.
* Have you tried the RedSn0w 0.9.9b1? If not, you can find it on our downloads page.
* Note: This is an untethered jailbreak for all firmwares with untethered jailbreaks available before (4.3.3 and below). Everything else, including iOS 5 betas are tethered only. This version of RedSn0w doesn’t introduce any new untethered jailbreaks, just new features.
