* Apple posted an update on Thursday for its Apple Store app, bringing the app to version 3.3. The update brings about at least two significant improvements: support for Touch ID and Apple ID two-step verification.
* Folks checking their Apple Watch orders frequently using the app will be happy to hear that you no longer have to input your password. You can now use Touch ID to access orders, Easy Pay receipts and reservations.
* Two-step verification is also a nice addition, which gives you extra security for your Apple ID account. Apple has begun really pushing for users to sign up for two-step in recent months—for help with setup, click here.
* You can find the Apple Store app in the App Store for free.
