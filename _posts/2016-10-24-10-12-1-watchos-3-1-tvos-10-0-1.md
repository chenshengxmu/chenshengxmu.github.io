* In addition to iOS 10.1, Apple on Monday released updates for its other 3 growing software platforms. After a month of beta testing, macOS Sierra 10.12.1, watchOS 3.1 and tvOS 10.0.1 are now available to the public and can be installed via their respective over-the-air Update mechanisms.
* Unlike iOS 10.1, these updates don’t include any significant user-facing features or changes. They’re mostly focused on “bug fixes and improvements,” with tvOS patching a coloring issue with the “Hold To Dictate” text, and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 bringing about fixes for a number of known bugs:
* – Adds an automatic smart album in Photos for Depth Effect images taken on iPhone 7 Plus
* – Improves the compatibility of Microsoft Office when using iCloud Desktop and Documents
* – Fixes an issue that may prevent Mail from updating when using a Microsoft Exchange account
* – Fixes an issue that caused text to sometimes paste incorrectly when using Universal Clipboard
* – Improves reliability of Auto Unlock with Apple Watch
* – Improves security and stability in Safari
* It’s also been discovered that macOS 10.12.1 includes support for new Mac hardware, which Apple is expected to unveil at its October 27 event, so stay tuned for that. We’re installing the software updates now, and will be sure to update this post if we find anything else new worth mentioning.
