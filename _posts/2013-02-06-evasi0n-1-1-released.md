* Earlier today, the evad3rs uploaded two new packages to Cydia that were built to fix a few bugs found in the latest jailbreak: one that caused the Weather app to crash, and another that caused longer reboot times.
* This afternoon, the team has released an update to evasi0n, bringing the utility to version 1.1. And as expected, it includes these bug fixes, so users should no longer encounter them when jailbreaking their devices…
* If you’re already jailbroken, and either aren’t experiencing any of the aforementioned problems or have already downloaded the fixes through Cydia, then this doesn’t really apply to you. There’s nothing new in evasi0n 1.1.
* But for those who haven’t jailbroken yet, or plan on doing it again in the near future, you’ll want to grab the new version of evasi0n to keep the process as painless as possible. As usual, you can find it on our Downloads page.
* Once you’ve downloaded it, make sure to visit our dedicated evasi0n section. We have step-by-step tutorials on how to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch for both Windows and Mac platforms.
