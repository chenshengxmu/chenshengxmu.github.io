* On the new feature front, Facebook has added the ability to share articles via Facebook Messages, text message, or email. And you can also now turn off the app’s sound effects so you can browse through the posts of your friends and family in peace…

* For those unfamiliar with the app, Paper allows you to browse stories from your Facebook News Feed in beautiful Flipboard-like layouts. You can customize sections with your own personal interests, craft your own stories and watch fullscreen videos.
* Overall the app has been very well received, described by many users as ‘what the original Facebook app should’ve been,’ and is worth checking out if you haven’t yet. If you’re interested, you can find Paper (for iPhone only) in the App Store for free.
