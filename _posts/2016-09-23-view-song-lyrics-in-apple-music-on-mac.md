* If you use Apple Music to listen to your favorite tracks on your Mac, then it’s easy to follow along with the lyrics of any song.
* You can view song lyrics on your Mac in one of two ways; either from the main iTunes window, or from the iTunes mini player. We’ll outline the steps for both ways to view song lyrics in Apple Music on your Mac below.
* If you aren’t using the iTunes mini player, you can view a song’s lyrics by following these steps:
* 1) Click on the Menu button at the top of the iTunes interface.
