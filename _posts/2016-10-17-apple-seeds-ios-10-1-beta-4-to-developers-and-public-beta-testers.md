* Apple today released a fourth beta of iOS 10.1 to its registered developers and public beta testers. Coming just a week after the previous beta, iOS 10.1 beta 4 has an interesting build number of “14B72 | 14B72b”. Today’s release does not, however, appear to contain any outward-facing user features. We’ll make sure to update the article with any new information as it becomes available.
* The first iOS 10.1 beta has added a Portrait feature that iPhone 7 Plus owners can use in the Photos app to create DSLR-like depth of field photographs (so-called “bokeh” effect). Here’s an example of what a photo taken in Portrait mode looks like.

* To refresh your memory, iOS 10.1 beta 3 also added a handy switch for enabling the Reduce Motion feature while retaining the new iMessage screen and bubble effects.

* So if you want to turn off parallax and other UI effects, but keep animations in Messages, you’ll be able to do that when iOS 10.1 releases for public consumption.
* According to Apple’s official release notes, the latests beta still shows a bunch of known issues in CloudKit, HomeKit, UIKit, Messages, Photos, Safari, Setup Assistant, Notes, Widgets and several other areas of the operating system.
