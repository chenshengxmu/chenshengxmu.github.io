* The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Tuesday granted Apple a patent for acoustic fingerprint imaging technology that could work beneath a display and replace its current Touch ID fingerprint reader.
* Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 9,747,488 for an “Active sensing element for acoustic imaging systems” details a fingerprint imaging system using acoustic elements to read fingerprints without requiring physical contact between your skin and the sensor.
* Ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers arranged in a pattern beneath a display send out an acoustic pulse toward the top substrate surface, which is then reflected off a finger touching the top surface of the substrate. The transducer array reads the reflected acoustic waves and turns the signals into an image of your fingerprint.
* According to Apple, the system is based on so-called acoustic boundary relying on acoustic impedance mismatch between the top surface and the portion of object engaging it. For example, a ridge of a fingerprint may present a different acoustic boundary when touching the substrate than a valley of a fingerprint.

* Accordingly, a ridge of a fingerprint may reflect the acoustic pulse differently than a valley of a fingerprint. In other words, a ridge of a fingerprint produces a different acoustic output than a valley of a fingerprint, allowing the sensing elements to turn electrical signals into pixels.
* It’s unclear if today’s patent grant means that Apple has already implemented an acoustic fingerprint reader in its upcoming iPhone 8. The rumors have suggested that Apple’s in-screen solution is not yet ready for prime time. Still, this patent could be implemented in a one of subsequent iPhone models.
* First filed for in August 2015, the invention credits Apple engineers Mohammad Yeke Yazdandoost, Giovanni Gozzini and Jean-Marie Bussat as its inventors.
