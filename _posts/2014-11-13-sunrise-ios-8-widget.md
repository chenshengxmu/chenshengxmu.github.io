* After gaining push support for Google Calendar, enhanced search and Todoist integration back in September and issuing a few maintenance updates since, Sunrise, the popular cross-platform calendar and to-do application, on Thursday launched a major new version in the App Store.
* Sunrise now features native display support for the new 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus resolutions so it will no longer run enlarged on the new iPhones.
* You can now authorize both Google Tasks and Eventbrite services for use in Sunrise and there’s a brand new widget for the Today view of the Notification Center on iOS 8.
* Respective iOS and OS X edition of Sunrise are available free in the App Store and Mac App Store.
* If you manage your tasks in Google Tasks, Sunrise can now integrate with Google’s service and bring all your to-dos from Google, as depicted on the screenshot above, allowing you to create and edit Google Tasks directly in Sunrise.
* And if you enable Eventbrtie integration, Sunrise will let you buy a ticket on the service and it will appear in Sunrise with all the information you need to get there.
* Check out Sunrise’s Today widget below.

* After enabling the widget by tapping the Edit button at the bottom of Today view in the Notification Center, you can quickly check what’s next in your day in the Notification Center or on the Lock screen, without opening Sunrise.
* And here’s Sunrise on that huge iPhone 6 Plus screen.
