* Vemedio has released version 5 of its popular Instacast podcast client this morning, and it is absolutely packed with new features and improvements. Perhaps the most obvious change is the new design, which gives the app a much more modern look.
* And as you’d hope, the new UI looks great on the new iPhones, as it includes full support for their larger displays. The app also includes support for iOS 8 extensions, which allows you to share episode show notes, links and more via the iOS share sheet.
* Just to give you an idea of the scope of this update, the change log for Instacast 5.0 lists over 20 items. There’s a new video experience that includes fullscreen landscape video playback, and a new search feature in podcasts and episodes—the list goes on.

* Additionally, there’s also a new Night Mode, which you can see in the above screenshot. This feature darkens the UI for easier nighttime usage, and can be manually enabled or set to auto-activate. Unfortunately, it must be unlocked via an in-app purchase.
* In fact there are a few features hidden behind in-app purchases, which all look like they cost $0.99. Otherwise, Instacast is available for iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free. It also has a solid Mac counterpart, which is in the Mac App Store for $19.99.
