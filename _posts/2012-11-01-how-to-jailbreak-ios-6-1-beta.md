title: How to jailbreak iOS 6.1 beta
---
* If you’re a developer wishing to jailbreak your pre-A5 device running iOS 6.1 beta, then you’ll be happy to know that it can be easily done using the same method we used to jailbreak the iOS 6.0.1 public release.
* This is, of course, a tethered jailbreak, and it only works with pre-A5 devices like the iPhone 4, or the iPhone 3GS. For the full video tutorial, check inside…
* Note: iOS 6.1 beta is for developers only.
* Step 1: Download RedSn0w 0.9.15b3 and iOS 6.0 from our Downloads page.
* Step 2: Place your pre-A5 device into DFU mode with it connected to your computer.
* Step 3: Open RedSn0w, and click Extras > Select IPSW, and select the 6.0 firmware for your device. It should successfully identify the 6.0 firmware. Click back.
* Step 4: Click Jailbreak on the main page of RedSn0w, then once it’s finished loading, ensure Install Cydia is checked and click Next.
* Step 5: The jailbreak process will begin, and it will take a bit to finish. Once finished, you should be at your Lock screen. Close out of RedSn0w.
* Step 6: Place the device back into DFU mode, and reopen RedSn0w. Go to Extras > Select IPSW, and again point to the 6.0 firmware.
* Step 7: Once it successfully identifies, click Just boot. A tethered boot will be performed, and eventually you’ll end up back on your Lock screen. Unlock the device, and you should see Cydia on the second page of your Home screen.
* Congratulations, you just jailbroke iOS 6.1 beta.
* As always, we recommend that you check out our dedicated RedSn0w tutorial page for more instruction regarding RedSn0w. Also, be sure to let us know what you think in the comments below.
