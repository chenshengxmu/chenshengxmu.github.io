* “Facebook is hiring Apple Inc. veterans to help it create a Siri-style voice assistant that would run on both devices,” reads the article citing people familiar with the matter who asked not be named discussing unannounced products.
* Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported last month that the social network is working on its own HomePod rival with a fifteen-inch screen built by LG Display using in-cell technology.
