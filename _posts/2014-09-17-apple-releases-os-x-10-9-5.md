* Rounding out its day of software releases, Apple this evening has pushed out OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 for Mac users. Developers have been testing the beta over the last few months, and it includes a new version of Safari and various improvements.
* Among those improvements is better reliability of VPN connections that use USB smart cards for authentication, which should please enterprise users, and easier access of files located on an SMB server. It’s definitely more of a maintenance release.

* It seems very likely that OS X 10.9.5 will be the final Mavericks update, before Apple moves on to OS X Yosemite. We don’t know exactly when Yosemite will be released, but the consensus is we’ll see it sometime next month, possibly alongside new Macs.
* To update your Mac to OS X 10.9.5, simply launch the Mac App Store and visit the ‘Updates’ tab.
