* Apple added a nifty feature in the iOS 5 weather app that lets you see the hourly forecast. Instead of the daily forecast, you can drill down each day and see hour-by-hour temperatures and rain percentages.
* Simple tap on the current day in the Weather app to trigger a drop down with the hourly forecast for the day. Nifty!
