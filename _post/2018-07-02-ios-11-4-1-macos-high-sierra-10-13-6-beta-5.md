* Apple on Monday released to its registered developers fifth betas of the minor iOS 11.4.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 software updates.
* Arriving a week following the previous betas, the new iOS 11.4.1 beta 5 (build number 15G5077a) and macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (build number 17G62a) can be installed on any supported iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Mac model with an appropriate configuration profile from Apple, via the standard Software Update mechanism.
* With iOS 12, it’s easy to overlook today’s releases. After all, they are extremely minor by comparison—while the former brings about new features and dramatic performance improvements, the latter contains more bug fixes and under-the-hood changes.
* We’ll report back any notable changes or findings as soon as we encounter them.
