* Apple Design Award winner Tapity announced that its popular time-tracking application, Hours for iPhone, will be available for the new Apple Watch “on day one”. While telling time is the core function of any watch, time tracking could easily become the killer feature of Apple’s device.
* Designed to take the pain out of time tracking by visualizing how you spend your precious time, Hours for iPhone debuted in mid-July and we immediately fell in love with it.
* “The Apple Watch will be a game-changed for tracking time with Hours,” developer Jeremy Olson tells me.
* Indeed, the combo does form the ultimate convenience for people who want to keep track of how they spend their time but keep forgetting to start and stop the timers.
* The Apple Watch app should take time-tracking “to a whole new level” as you’ll be able to switch timers without even taking your phone out of your pocket.
* “Just glance at your wrist and tap,” reads the post.
* Unfortunately, a pair of quick mockups Tapity shared in a blog post don’t reveal much in terms of the user interface or features.

* “We absolutely cannot wait to start time tracking on the Apple Watch and you can bet Hours will be available for Apple Watch on day one,” says the post.
* Hours for iPhone, pictured below, simplifies time tracking with its efficient and simple user interface, the ability to easily customize timers, create timers on a per-project or per-client basis, set reminders so you don’t forget to start the timer when you, say, get up or get to work, and much more.

* Tapity is also working on a Today widget for the iOS 8 Notification Center which, according to developers, has been designed to make these actions “just a swipe away”, even from the Home screen.
* The $9.99 Hours app requires an iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 7.0 or later. The 3.8-megabyte download has an average rating of 4.5 stars.
