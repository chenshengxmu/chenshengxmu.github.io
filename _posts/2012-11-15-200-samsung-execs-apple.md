* A report out Thursday from Korean news organization The Chosun Ilbo has it that some two hundred Samsung executives are scheduled to meet with Samsung’s top dogs in December. Corporate matters will be on the agenda, including that long-standing patent dispute with Apple which has poisoned business relationship between the two consumer electronics giants to the point of no return.
* The report also mentions that Samsung recently fired its vice president in charge of matters relating to Apple, another indication that Samsung’s litigation strategy concerning Apple is about to change. The same news organization earlier in the week asserted that Samsung instituted a massive chip price hike that analysts feared could hurt Apple’s margins, but the story was debunked the following day by an unnamed Samsung executive…
* BGR relays a report by The Chosun Ilbo:
* Samsung Electronics top executives and about 200 chiefs of overseas branches meet on December 17-18 to discuss strategy in the face of the global recession and an intensifying standoff with rival Apple. The meeting takes place in Suwon and Giheung, Gyeonggi Province.
* This being an annual global strategy meeting, a bunch of topics will be discussed that concern the Galaxy maker’s strategy and the landscape in 2013. The story also notes the managers will set “quite new guidelines for the tech giant’s worldwide sales network”.
* Steve Jobs used to hold secret annual meetings to give a cherry-picked group of about a hundred execs a glimpse into Apple’s future plans.
* Hopefully, some good will come out of this mega-meeting though I’m not keeping my fingers crossed because Samsung’s mobile head told reporters yesterday his company is not interested in reaching an HTC-like licensing agreement.
* We no longer have any intention of negotiating with Apple about patent issues.
* On the other hand, you’d think Samsung would be interested in reaching a global settlement of sorts after it had gotten slammed with the $1+ billion verdict in the massive Apple v. Samsung case in the United States.
* Aren’t you tiring of patent wars?
