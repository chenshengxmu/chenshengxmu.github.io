* Remember that awesome iOS ’86 theme concept we showed you last week? The one that looked like it came straight off an old Mac Plus computer? Well it’s now available in Cydia for your downloading pleasure.
* Conceptualized by designer Anton Repponen, and created by an author named AR7, iOS ’86 gives your new school device, an old school feel. And here’s how you can install it on your jailbroken iPhone or iPod touch…

* The theme isn’t available in the default repos, and doesn’t come with its own wallpaper. So we’ve put together this quick tutorial to make sure your iOS device is looking right.
* Step 1. Open Cydia, and add http://repo.ithemes.it to your list of sources (you’ll notice that Cydia warns you that the repo has been reported for redistributing copyrighted works. iDB doesn’t normally recommend installing these kinds of repos, but this was the only place we could find the theme).
* Step 2. Once the repo is installed, do a search in Cydia for ‘iOS 86’ and install it.
* Step 3. Now you’ll need to activate the theme in Winterboard (If you don’t have it, you’ll need to install it), and re-spring your device.
* Step 4. And finally, it’s not mandatory, but we recommend you download and apply this white wallpaper to complete the look.
* That’s all there is to it! It’s worth noting that the theme isn’t very extensive. It doesn’t seem to support many (if any) icons outside of the native set, and it doesn’t change the look of any other UI elements.
* But we have to admit, it still looks good. Here’s hoping that its creator plans to add new icons and other elements in the future.
* What do you think of iOS ’86?
