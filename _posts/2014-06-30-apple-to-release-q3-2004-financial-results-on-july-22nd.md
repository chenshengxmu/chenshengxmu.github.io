* Apple just announced via its Investor Relations portal that the company will be discussing financial results of its third fiscal quarter on July 22nd, during a conference call starting at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m ET. Based on past behavior, it is safe to assume that Apple will be publishing a press release with all relevant financial information a few minutes prior to the call’s beginning.
* During the conference call, Apple will discuss basic sales numbers and financials for its line of products, but don’t expect them to reveal anything about future products. We will of course be on deck to report any information that might be relevant to our readers…
* This earnings release will also be the first one for new Apple CFO Luca Maestri who recently replaced retiring CFO Peter Oppenheimer as the head of Apple’s finances.
* Everyone can listen to the conference call as Apple makes it available for streaming.
