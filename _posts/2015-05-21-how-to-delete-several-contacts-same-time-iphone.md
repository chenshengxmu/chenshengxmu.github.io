* If there is one app that hasn’t changed much since it was released along the first generation iPhone, it is the Contacts app. Besides a fresh coat of iOS 7 paint, it didn’t see any noticeable features added to it, leaving room for third-party apps to come in and offer more functionality.
* If you’re wondering how to delete several contacts at the same time on your iPhone for example, then don’t waste your time playing with the Contacts app, because it won’t let you do that. You can painstakingly delete one contact at a time, but you’re not able to delete several of them at once.
* That’s where App Store apps come in handy.
* If you want to delete multiple contacts at once on your iPhone, you will have to download an app from the App Store. There are many that offer the ability to do that, but I’ve been using Cleaner Pro previously, and although the free version is limited, it does offer many options, including the ability to remove several contacts in one shot.
* Step 1: Download Cleaner Pro from the App Store. That’s the free version.
* Step 2: Launch the app and go to the All Contacts tab, then tap the Edit icon.

* Step 3: Select the contacts you want to delete, then tap on the small Trash icon at the lower right corner.

* Step 4: Confirm you indeed want to delete these contacts by tapping Delete.
* If you want to go thermonuclear on your contacts and delete all of them at the same time, then Cleaner Pro will allow you to do that too.
* To do so, follow step 1 and 2 from above, and instead of selecting contacts one by one, tap the little check mark icon in the upper right corner. Doing so will select all contacts.

* From there tap the Trash can icon and confirm you do want to delete all your contacts.
