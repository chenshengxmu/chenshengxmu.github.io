* In a tweet sent yesterday, Musclenerd confirmed that tomorrowâ€™s iOS 4 will be unlockable. Even better than that is the fact that the iPhone 4 itself will most likely be unlockable too.
* Those of you on an iPhone 3GS with baseband 05.12.01 will now be able to unlock as well.
* The Dev Team has been keeping this exploit secret for a while and saved it for the major update that iOS 4 is.
