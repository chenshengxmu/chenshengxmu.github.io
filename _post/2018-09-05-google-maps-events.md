* The search giant yesterday refreshed the Google Maps app for iPhone and iPad on App Store, adding a new Events feature and elevation data for walking and cycling routes.
* Version 4.57 introduces an all-new Events section.
* To get started, tap the Explore tab at the bottom of the app, then scroll down to the new Events section to get a list of everything happening nearby, such as a late night comedy show, a movie in the park, or your favorite chef’s weekend popup.
* Now when you’re looking up biking and walking directions, Google Maps will display a handy chart that shows you the elevation of your route. This is an especially useful feature for cycling directions.

* If you plan on going on a long bicycle ride, consult this chart to see if you might be in for a serious case of cardio. Elevation data has been available on the Google Maps website for some time.
* Download Google Maps from App Store.
