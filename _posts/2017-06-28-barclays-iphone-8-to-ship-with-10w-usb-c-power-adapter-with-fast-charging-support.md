* Apple’s 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is expected to ship with a stronger ten-watt power adapter in its box, featuring a USB-C connector and fast-charging support. That’s according to Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis’s note to clients Wednesday, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors.
* Current iPhones include a five-watt power adapter in the box.
* The analyst claims that iPhone 8 will include a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery chip that enables fast charging capabilities. The new ten-watt power adapter will also sport an integrated USB-C Power Delivery chip. Both chips will be supplied by Cypress Semiconductor and it’s basically the same CYPD2104 part used in Apple’s new 10.5-inch iPad Pro.
* It should be noted that iPhone 7 already supports fast-charging capability when connected to Apple’s 29-watt USB-C power adapter for MacBook via a Lightning to USB-C cable.
* The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the 10.5-inch iPad Pro are capable of fast charging, too.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in March that the OLED-based iPhone 8 would retain its Lightning connector and have a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery chip on the logic board.
* Assuming Curtis is right, iPhone 8 might come bundled with either a Lightning to USB-C cable or a female USB-C to male USB-A adapter with an integrated fast-charging chip so that customers could use their existing Lightning to USB cable to fast-charge the phone.
