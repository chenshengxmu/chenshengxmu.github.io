* This is pretty interesting. Pod2g just announced that the new iOS 6.1.1 beta that Apple seeded to developers yesterday does not actually patch the exploits used in the latest jailbreak.
* The beta came just a week after Apple rolled out iOS 6.1 to the public, and two days after the release of evasi0n, so it was assumed that the two were related. But that may not be the case…
* 6.1.1 beta (10B311) does not fix the jailbreak. It’ll probably happen in a future revision. Don’t upgrade though, evasi0n won’t let you jb.

* At least not yet anyway. Remember, this is just beta 1 of what will likely be 3 or 4 developer releases. But for the time being, pod2g says that 6.1.1 does not fix any of the jailbreak’s security holes.
* He does, however, say that evasi0n will not jailbreak iOS 6.1.1, so it’s still highly recommended that developers, and anyone else with access to the beta, stay away from the update for now.
* And we haven’t found anything in iOS 6.1.1 yet worth updating anyway—unless of course you live in Japan. The release notes for the beta include a number of Maps improvements for the country.
