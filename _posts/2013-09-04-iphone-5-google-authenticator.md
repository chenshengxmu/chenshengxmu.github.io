* Good news for all of you folks who have been using Google’s Authenticator app. The search giant has posted a big 2.0 update for the client, which brings about a number of long-awaited improvements like iPhone 5 support.
* Google Authenticator, for those who are unfamiliar with the app, works with 2-step verification for your Google account to provide an extra layer of security. And it’s been redesigned today to make it easier than ever to use…
* From the app’s 2.0 change log:
* Support for retina display and iPhone 5. Improved user interface. Minor bug fixes. Improved accessibility support.
* With 2-Step Verification, signing into your account requires both your password and a verification code generated with this app. Once configured, you can get verification codes without the need of a network or cellular connection.
* The app features automatic setup via QR codes, support for multiple accounts, and support for time-based and counter-based code generation.
* As usual, you can find Google Authenticator in the App Store. And yes, it’s free. A word of caution though, TechCrunch is reporting that installing the new version of the app may result in the wiping of existing stored account data.
