* Today we finally got to go hands-on with a near final beta version of IntelliScreenX — the highly anticipated jailbreak app for iOS 5’s Notification Center — and let’s just cut to the chase, it lives up to the hype, and then some.
* Ladies and gentlemen, this is how Notification Center is done. IntelliScreenX makes iOS 5’s new pull down menu, a literal center of notifications.
* There’s Twitter, Facebook, RSS, and email, and it’s done in such a way that you can communicate without ever leaving Notification Center; you can even do so from the Lock screen.
* Check inside for a full video preview of IntelliScreenX, and you’ll see why this upcoming app is reason enough alone to jailbreak your iPhone…
* True, there have been similar apps like this done in the past — LockInfo immediately comes to mind. While I am a huge admirer of LockInfo, and everything that the developer of that app has done, I could never keep it on my iPhone for very long.
* With LockInfo, I simply felt it was too complicated and too cumbersome to keep as a permanent staple on my iPhone. I realize I am definitely in the minority here, and will no doubt feel the wrath of the legions of LockInfo supporters, but it’s the truth.

* With IntelliScreenX, the developer has taken an already existing iOS 5 framework, and simply added on to it, simply modified it to fit their needs. For that reason, it feels less complicated, more natural, and a lot more stable than LockInfo; even at this early stage in the game.
* Additionally, IntelliScreenX’s two-way communication methodology is excellent. Everything is so quick, so snappy, so spontaneous. Twitter feeds are pushed in real time, RSS feeds can be updated with a swipe; Facebook, and email work largely in the same manner.

* Maybe things feel more natural to me with IntelliScreenX, because I’m used to having Notification Center as an integral part of my daily routine. I can’t really put my finger on just what it is, but it just feels right.
* As you’ve no doubt gleaned from the video, IntelliScreenX is probably one of the most highly anticipated jailbreak apps for iOS 5 — arguably, ever. I’m excited to report that even at this stage, it’s living up to that hype quite nicely. What’s even more exciting, is that the potential for growth is staggering.
