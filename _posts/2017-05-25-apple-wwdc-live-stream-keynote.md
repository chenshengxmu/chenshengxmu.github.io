* Apple is going to once again be providing a live stream of its WWDC keynote address this year. On Thursday the company updated its website with a new page noting that a stream of the keynote will go live on June 5th at 10am PDT.
* You will be able to tune in on your Mac and iOS devices, using the Safari browser, and of course on Apple TV. Second and third gen models of the set-top box will feature an Events channel, and fourth-gen models will get a standalone app.
* Apple is expected to use the keynote to introduce the next major versions of its four platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. There’s also been rumors speculating that the company will debut new Mac and iPad hardware during the event.
* Even if you plan on watching the keynote, be sure to join us here at iDB that Monday. As usual we’ll be covering the event live, as well as all subsequent announcements and releases, so you’ll be able to keep up with the news throughout the day.
