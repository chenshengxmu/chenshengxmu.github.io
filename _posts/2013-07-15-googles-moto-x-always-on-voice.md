* When it comes to flagship smartphone sales, it’s essentially a two-horse race between Apple’s iPhone line and Samsung’s Galaxy S line. Both companies account for nearly all of the industry’s profits, and frequently trade-off the title of top-selling manufacturer.
* But Google is looking to change that with its upcoming Moto X handset. The device, which has been the subject of a number of rumors and leaks over the past few months, is the company’s first since it acquired Motorola’s hardware division nearly two years ago…
* As far as specs go, the X is believed to have a 4.7-inch or 5-inch display, a quad-core Snapdragon processor, a 10MP+ camera and a staggering 4,000mAh battery. That last tidbit might seem crazy if Motorola didn’t already have a phone out with a 3,300mAh pack.

* While the numbers look good, the X’s major selling points are said to be a little more unique. In addition to being extremely durable, and water-resistant, the device is expected to be user-customizable, meaning users could pick the phone’s RAM, storage, and color.
* Some of the software features of the handset are also interesting. It’s been said that the device has advanced sensor-tracking, letting it know when you’re in a car or want to take a picture, so it can act accordingly. It’s also believed to have an always-on voice assistant.
* Here’s a purported leaked demo video showcasing some of these features:

* Admittedly, some of the Moto X’s abilities are impressive, but will they be enough to impact iPhone and Galaxy sales? That’s tough to say at this point. Motorola has struggled to produce a hit product in years, and it remains to be seen if Google’s input can change that.
* It seems determined though. Earlier this year, Google’s CFO told investors that Motorola’s pipeline of products weren’t really up to Google’s “wow” standards, and that they had to essentially drain 18 months of the company’s roadmap and start completely from scratch.
* The Moto X is expected to launch sometime this fall, possibly in October, right alongside the iPhone 5S. It’ll be interesting to see how this impacts both Apple and Samsung gameplans, as the two tech giants continue to battle for smartphone marketshare around the globe.
* What do you think about the Moto X? Should Apple or Samsung be worried?
