* Hot on the heels of AT&T’s announcement earlier today that it has been seeing enormous demand for the iPhone 4S, Apple itself now seems to be feeling the pressure.
* Earlier today we reported that the Cupertino company was forced to push back international shipping dates for the iPhone 4S, and now the delay has spilled over into the US…
* 9to5Mac sounded the alarm this evening, pointing out that Apple appears to have sold through its initial preorder allotment. The company’s website now shows an estimated iPhone 4S shipping time of 1-2 weeks.
* If you haven’t ordered the new handset yet, but are planning on it, we recommend that you get moving. At the time of this writing, you can still purchase the iPhone 4S on Apple.com, you just won’t get it by October 14.
