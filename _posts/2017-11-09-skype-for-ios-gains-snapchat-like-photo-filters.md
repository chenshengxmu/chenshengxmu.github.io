* Following the recently introduced chat bots, in-call reactions and several Stories-like features, software giant Microsoft yesterday announced all-new Snapchat-style filters for your photos in the mobile Skype app for iPhone and iPad app.
* Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, these effects for your photos or Highlights are powered by Microsoft’s Sprinkles app and include quirky face stickers and witty captions with customized effects options based on what’s in each picture.
* To access the new effects, tap the magic wand button at the top of the interface after taking a photo. Photo effects may include a witty caption, celebrity lookalike, smart face sticker, location and weather and mystery face swap. Microsoft says they’re always changing and advises you try them on different days of the week and during holidays.
* “With photo effects on Skype, you can easily add a dash of wit and creativity to your everyday moments,” notes Microsoft. “Share decorated photos with your friends and family via chat or on your Highlights.”

* Desktop Skype was thoroughly refreshed ten days ago with an all-new interface with customizable themes and new features such as cloud-based file sharing and more while the mobile app gained Cortana integration.
* Skype for iPhone and Skype for iPad are available at no charge in App Store.
