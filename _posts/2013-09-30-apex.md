* Apex is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows you to nest app icons on your Home screen in a way that may eliminate the need for folders. It’s an especially cool tool for grouping like applications such as the stock Mail app, and many of the other popular 3rd party Mail apps.
* Apex is from Sentry’s a3tweaks, which has been responsible for a long repertoire of awesome jailbreak tweaks, including Auxo. Indeed, Apex works as awesome as it looks, and I’m confident that many will enjoy this upcoming release. Have a look at our brief video preview inside for more details.
* Apex is still being worked on, but should be available shortly on Cydia. What do you think about the overall concept?
