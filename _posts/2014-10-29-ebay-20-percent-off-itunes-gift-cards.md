* If you’ve been on the lookout for the latest deals on iTunes Gift Cards, head over to PayPal’s Digital Gifts eBay store as it’s currently offering 20 percent off iTunes Gift Cards in several denominations. The $25, $50 and $100 cards are now available with a twenty percent discount so you’ll end up paying $20, $40 and $80, respectively.
* That’s a nice 20 percent saving right off the bat on anything you purchase on Apple’s content stores. iTunes Gift Cards can be used to buy Mac and iOS apps, electronic books, movies, TV shows, music and other digital items carried on Apple’s content stores.
* You can also apply your iTunes credit toward the purchase of iCloud storage upgrades and use it to buy stuff in apps via In-App Purchases.
* Better yet, use the discounted cards to buy apps on sale, effectively doubling up on your savings. You can pay for your iTunes Gift Card using your Visa, American Express, MasterCard or Discover card. Of course, eBay is accepting PayPal as a method of payment, too.
* Keep in mind that these are digital rather than physical cards, meaning they’ll send the code to your PayPal registered email. To redeem the code, open iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC, or the App Store on your iOS device. Now look for the Redeem option on the iTunes Stores’ front page, or at the bottom of the App Store’s Featured tab.
* The deal is only valid for U.S. buyers. Limited quantity is available so better hurry up while the deal is still alive.
