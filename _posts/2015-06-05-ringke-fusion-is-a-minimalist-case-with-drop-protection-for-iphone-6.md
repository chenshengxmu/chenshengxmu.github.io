* Whenever a minimalist case is mentioned on iDB, someone always asks whether it has protection from drops. For the most part, minimalist cases don’t really protect from anything significant, other than scratches on the backside. They offer protection in the most minimal of ways.
* The Ringke Fusion is slightly less minimalist, but slightly more protective. Not only does it have dust caps to keep ports from getting dirty, but it also has added layers on the corners for a bit of drop protection.
* The company touts this as “the world’s hardest case,” which is obviously an exaggeration, but you get the idea. It is protective. The TPU case is made with a special scratch resistant and anti-static coating to repel dust.
* It has a tapered lip on the front to keep your screen off of flat surfaces, while still giving a sense of slimness. The lifted camera bezel reaches past the back-facing camera’s lens.
* The case is also designed with “active touch” buttons. They are slightly larger than your iPhone 6’s switches and buttons to make it just a bit easier to find and use them. The headphone jack and Lightning port are both covered with dust caps.
* The four corners have additional layers of shock-absorption protection so your iPhone 6 can have a better chance of surviving a drop than if it weren’t protected at all. Keep in mind that this is a minimalist case. You won’t get the same kind of protection as a rugged case like the Otterbox Fré.
* The Ringke Fusion comes in a variety of colors that range in price from $10 to $17 on Amazon. There is a version for the iPhone 6 Plus for $12.
