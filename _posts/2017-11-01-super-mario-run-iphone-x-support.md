* Nintendo today updated Super Mario Run on App Store with iPhone X support and bug fixes.
* If you’re a fan of the game and have preordered your iPhone X, update to Super Mario Run 3.0.6 so the game properly accommodates the notch and fits the OLED screen of your iPhone X.
* This version also fixes an issue where players could not perfectly clear a course and another one where some items did not appear in the Notebook.
* Nintendo during its earnings report two days ago revealed that Fire Emblem Heroes is on track to meet its “overall profit objectives,” but warned that Super Mario Run has “not yet reached an acceptable profit point” for the game.
* Super Mario Run has now hit 200 million downloads, 90 percent of which came from outside of Japan, as Nintendo launched the game in countries “not previously reached by our dedicated video game platform business.”
* Nintendo didn’t reveal any specifics with regards to conversion rates.
* “Although we have not yet reached an acceptable profit point, we have learned a lot in terms of game development and deployment that we want to take advantage of moving forward,” the company told investors.
* Although both games are free to download, Fire Emblem Heroes relies on micro transactions while Super Mario Run requires a one-time $9.99 In-App Purchase to unlock everything.
* Super Mario Run is a freemium download from App Store.
