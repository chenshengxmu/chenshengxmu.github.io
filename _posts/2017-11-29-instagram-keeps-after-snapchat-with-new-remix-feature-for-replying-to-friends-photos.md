* In a press release posted to the company’s website, Instagram has announced upcoming changes to version 24 of its iPhone and Android app. You will now be able to reply and “remix” pictures friends have sent you, including adding stickers, text and drawings.
* To use Remix, just tap the camera icon when viewing a photo message from a friend. Then go ahead and record your reply.
* The reply automatically includes a sticker of the original photo that can be moved and resized.
* You can then add any additional text, drawings, or stickers to send back in the remixed image.
* Remix is the headline feature here, but there are also updates to how you can control replays of private messages.
* Choose “One View” for messages you want your friends to only see once. For everything else, choose “Allow Replay” so your friends have more time to view your messages.

* Photos and videos that reply will automatically loop, and your friends can touch on the screen to pause the animation.

* You can download Instagram for free on the App Store.
