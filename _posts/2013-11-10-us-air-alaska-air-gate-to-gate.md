* Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration gave airlines the green-light to allow passengers to use devices such as tablets during all phases of flight. So that means no more turning off your iPad during takeoff.
* Now it’s just up to each individual airline to change their respective rules, and the good news is most of them seem to be onboard. American Airlines already announced its support, and now US Airways and Alaska Airlines are in…
* Here’s the press release from US Airways (via iClarified):
* “Beginning today US Airways customers can now use certain portable electronic devices (PEDs), including e-books, tablets and smartphones, during taxi, takeoff and landing while in “airplane mode” – a departure from the previous Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restriction on use below 10,000 feet. Customers on US Airways domestic mainline flights will now be permitted to use small PEDs during all phases of flight.”
* And here’s the announcement from Alaska Airlines:
* “Passengers on Alaska Airlines flights can begin enjoying the use of their tablets, book readers, games and other personal electronic devices from gate to gate starting Saturday morning. Passengers on Alaska Airlines flights operated by Horizon Air are expected to be able to use their electronic devices during all phases of their flight next week and on flights operated by SkyWest Airlines soon after, pending FAA approval”
* Of course, there are some stipulations. For one, cellular devices must still be put into ‘airplane’ mode during flights. And laptops and other devices over 2 lbs must still be put away during takeoff and landing due to safety concerns.
* The good news, though, is that passengers on participating airlines can now enjoy their tablets, smartphones, and any other proper device throughout the entirety of their flights, without being asked to turn them off or put them away.
* In addition to the 3 aforementioned airlines, Delta has also approved the use of devices below 10,000 feet, as has United Airlines, JetBlue and others. If you don’t see your airline listed here, you’ll obviously want to check ahead first.
