* The App Store opened on July 10, 2008. One day later, the iPhone 3G was launched. The rest, as they say, is history. Just days before the tenth anniversary of the App Store, Apple is reminding the world just how relevant the store has been, not only to the tech industry but to everyone else as well. 
* Before 2008, the overall software industry was dominated by a few large companies. Thanks to the App Store, developers large and small deliver the goods to over 1 billion people worldwide.
* In recalling the early days of the App Store, Phil Schiller, senior vice president, Worldwide Marketing, Apple, notes:
* In its first decade, the App Store has surpassed all of our wildest expectations — from the innovative apps that developers have dreamed up, to the way customers have made apps part of their daily lives — and this is just the beginning. We could not be more proud of what developers have created and what the next 10 years have in store.”
* With the introduction of the App Store, gaming was no longer just for those with consoles. It went mainstream thanks to early iOS titles like Super Monkey Ball, PAC-MAN, Angry Birds, Words With Friends, Real Racing, and Temple Run.
* After in-app purchases launched in 2009, things really took off. By June 2010, $1 billion would be paid out to developers from IAP and paid apps. Subscriptions soon followed. By June 2018, developers had made $100 billion from the App Store.
* Perhaps the most important thing to come out of the App Store has been the introduction of all-new software genres and the expansion of others. These include health, fitness, and wellness, to creative, entertainment, and productivity titles.
* The App Store has also provided crucial support for users with assistive needs. The coding industry has also benefited, as young people have embraced creating their own apps and games.
* When the App Store opened almost 10 years ago, it held 5oo apps. Today, there are millions of titles enjoyed by users in 155 countries worldwide.
