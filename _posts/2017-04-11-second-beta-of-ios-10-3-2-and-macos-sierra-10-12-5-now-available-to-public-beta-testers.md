* Both iOS 10.3.2 beta 2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta 2 are now available to the general public via the Apple Beta Software Program. Public betas of iOS 10.3.2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.5 follow their developer-only releases yesterday. If you’re enrolled in Apple’s public beta program, you should receive the latest iOS 10.3.2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.5 betas through the Software Update mechanism in Settings on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and via the Updates tab in Mac App Store on your Mac.
* Both public betas offer bug and stability fixes.
* iOS 10.3.2 will be arriving soon following the major iOS 10.3 software update which brought out many new features, under-the-hood tweaks and nice-to-haves, like a Find My AirPods feature for locating your misplaced earbuds, Apple’s new file system and more.
