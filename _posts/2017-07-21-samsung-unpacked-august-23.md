* As rumored, Samsung will be unveiling an eighth-generation Note phablet next month.
* According to a press release issued Friday, the Unpacked media event will be taking place on Wednesday, August 23 at Park Avenue Armory in New York City at 11am EST.
* The event will reveal the latest member of the Galaxy family “with the ultimate multitasking device for those who want to do bigger things with their phone,” reads the release.
* Although the South Korean conglomerate did not name “the latest member of the Galaxy family” to be unveiled at the event, it’s pretty clear this is about the next Note. The invite graphics suggests the new Note will adopt Galaxy S8’s nearly full-screen face with a curved AMOLED display and no physical Home button.
* Samsung says the phone was specifically designed for “people who move through barriers to do more of what matters to them.” A live stream of the event will be available on YouTube.
