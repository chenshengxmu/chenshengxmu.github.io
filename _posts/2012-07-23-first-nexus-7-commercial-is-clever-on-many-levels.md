title: First Nexus 7 commercial is clever on many levels

* Google’s Nexus 7 tablet is admittedly off to a surprising start, with demand crushing expectations as the pricier $249 16GB model has been out of stock over at the Google Play Store for a couple days now. While the Internet giant is ramping up production, an inaugural advert for the device was posted today at the official Google Nexus channel on YouTube.
* Though Google’s advertising is becoming increasingly cheesy lately (and it’s always been this way, cynics might add), this particular commercial is clever on many levels, I think. But you be the judge – it’s included right after the break…
* Titled “Camping”, the commercial plays heavily on the centuries old father-and-son theme. Just like Apple’s heartwarming FaceTime adverts (directed by a Hollywood film maker), Google’s Nexus 7 commercial depicts the young boy and his dad exploring the woods in their backyard with a little help from their Nexus 7 (never mind it has no cellular connectivity whatsoever).
* That’s as powerful and moving as that scene from a FaceTime advert where a US soldier in Iraq is doing Facetime with his pregnant wife back in America.
* The boy and his dad are seen using their Nexus 7 to search locations in Google Maps, find their way through the woods using a digital compass, get information on the web and finally read e-books, watch some movies and play games in their tent.
* Here it is.
* I don’t know, a father and son bonding – it doesn’t get any more powerful than that.
* I like it a lot.
* You?
