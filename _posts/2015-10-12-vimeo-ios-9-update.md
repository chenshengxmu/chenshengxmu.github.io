* The popular video-sharing service Vimeo has refreshed its iPhone and iPad application in the App Store with full support for iOS 9 technologies. For starters, videos you upload to the service and other content can now be found through iOS 9’s much improved Spotlight Search engine.
* Moreover, the new Vimeo 5.6 for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad now lets you multitask like a boss on the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 in side-by-side Split View and Slide Over modes while enjoying video in iOS 9’s picture-in-picture mode.
* On supported iPads, Vimeo can now run in picture-in-picture mode.
* This lets you watch a video on Vimeo in a smaller window as you surf the web, read your email and use other apps. Simply begin playing any video within the Vimeo app on your iPad and tap on the new picture-in-picture icon in playback controls to detach the video from the app.
* Now press the Home button and the video will continue playing in a small window in one of the corners of the screen. You can drag the video to any corner, resize it using the pinch-zoom gesture and return to the normal full-screen playback mode.
* Just pull down on any Home screen and up pops iOS 9’s much improved Spotlight interface. As you’re typing your query, iOS will auto-populate search results with matching items. If Vimeo is enabled in Settings → General → Spotlight Search, you will now see Vimeo videos in Spotlight that match your search query.
* If you own Google’s $35 Chromecast HDMI dongle, you’ll appreciate smoother experience than before. And of course, release notes accompanying the 38.1-megabyte download mention the unavoidable bug fixes.
* The only thing that’s changed are the following things:
* You may have not known it, but Vimeo features deep iOS integration just like Facebook, Twitter and Flickr do. Just launch Settings on your device and go to the Vimeo section to log in with your credentials.

* From now on, you will be able to post videos from other stock and third-party application to the service, using iOS’s multi-purpose Share menu.
* Vimeo requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. The app is localized in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish.
* Grab Vimeo free of charge in the App Store.
