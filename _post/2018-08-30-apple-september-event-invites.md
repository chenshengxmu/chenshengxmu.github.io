* Apple this morning invited select members of the press to its most important media event of the year where the Cupertino technology giant will be announcing a new iPhone family for 2018, likely several new Apple Watch Series 4 models and possibly other gadgets as well.
* As we suspected, the event will kick off Wednesday, September 12, at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, at 10am PT / 1pm ET.
* The invites went out this morning, featuring the tagline “Gather Round” and an image of a ring-shaped object. Both the tagline and the object appear to resemble Apple’s main flying saucer-shaped building at the new Apple Park headquarters.
* The invite seems to offer no hint as to what products might be introduced at the event.
* Steve Jobs Theater was home to Apple’s first event, held on September 12, 2017, that served as a launchpad for iPhone X and the all-new Apple Watch Series 3 models.
* Not unlike prior media events, CEO Tim Cook and his lieutenants will surely take turns on the stage of the 1,000-seat theater, itself dug into the hill next to the Apple Park headquarters, to tell us what they have in store for the upcoming holiday season.
* Here are three main themes we’re expecting from the forthcoming presser:
* Feel free to add predictions of your own in the comments down below.
* There was no new or updated hardware at Apple’s developers conference at the beginning of the summer. September is for annual iPhone and watch refreshes: last September brought us the new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models as well as Apple Watch Series 3.
* The Mac maker typically holds another media event in October after announcing new iPhone models in September so as to space out major product announcements and squeeze out as much free press from both media events as possible.
* In other words, refreshed iPads and Macs should be announced some time in October, but nothing is set in stone and things could change because Apple’s hands have become tied due to multiple delays in the roadmap of its chief Mac chip supplier, Intel.
* What are your expectations from Apple’s Fall reveal?
* To all you Kremlinologists out there, would you be so kind as to help us decipher the hidden meaning, if any, of the ring image Apple chose to feature on this invite?
