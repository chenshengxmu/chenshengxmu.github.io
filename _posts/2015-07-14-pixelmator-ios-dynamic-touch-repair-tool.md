* Pixelmator for iOS, which almost two months ago became a universal app with native iPhone support, was refreshed in the App Store this morning with a few new features and dozens of improvements, performance improvements and stability fixes.
* The Repair tool, which debuted on Pixelmator for Mac, is now up to five times faster on iPhone and iPad, and even more precise.
* And the all-new Dynamic Touch tool intelligently changes the stroke size of all Retouch tools based on your finger input: use the tip of your finger and you’ll create thin strokes; press harder, or use a larger surface area of your finger, and you’ll produce thicker lines.
* Moreover, Pixelmator’s Photo Editing extension has been improved to make it easier to apply Pixelmator’s effects within the context of iOS’s stock Photos app.
* Making retouching images way faster and more precise with the new Dynamic Touch tool required a more advanced touch detection algorithm.
* “When you touch the screen with your finger, Dynamic Touch detects the finger surface area in contact with the screen and automatically adjusts the brush size when the surface area changes,” explained the team.
* The same goes for Pixelmator’s advanced repairing algorithm, which originally debuted in Pixelmator for Mac. The much improved Repair tool in Pixelmator for iOS, in addition to being five times faster, makes it super easy to remove objects from your photos.
* It works like magic: simply tap on an area and it analyzes underlying image data and automatically removes unwanted spots, blemishes and even whole objects.
* “There are numerous ways to repair any area of an image, so we did a lot of testing on a Mac Pro to optimize the algorithm of our Repair tool,” said Simonas Bastys, the lead developer of the Pixelmator Team.
* “We analyzed millions of possible ways to repair areas of various complexity, and then compared the speed and quality ratio of each final result. After six months of testing, we derived a repairing algorithm that gives stunning quality with incredible speed every single time. Pixelmator for iOS now takes advantage of the same algorithm.”
* In addition to these improvements, Pixelmator for iPad has gained more robust support for the latest Adonit styluses, fixed an issue with stylus shortcuts and replaced the Brush Tool and Eraser Tool stylus shortcut options with one Toggle Eraser option.
* Pixelmator 2.0.2 changelog:
* New
* Improvements and bug fixes
* Improvements and fixes to Pixelmator for iPad:
* In addition to the aforesaid improvements, the Pixelmator team has said that users who want to learn everything there is to know about the app can now check out all-new Pixelmator for iPhone tutorials or consult the full Pixelmator User Guide.
* This update is available at no charge to Pixelmator’s existing users.
* The 95.9-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Pixelmator for iPhone and iPad is $4.99 in the App Store.
* In my view, that’s a steal considering this full-featured image editor supports layered Photoshop files and technologies like iCloud content syncing, Handoff and more.
* Pixlemator for Mac is $29.99 in the Mac App Store.
