* Thew new Photos app and Camera app included in iOS 7 is, as expected, a pretty significant departure from what we currently know and use. First and foremost, the new Photos app. The new Photos app auto organizes pictures based on when and where you took them, a featured dubbed Moments.
* One interesting aspect of Moments is the ability to zoom out, and selectively pick specific photos from the grouping by tapping and dragging your finger over the photos. Photo streams have received a significant update as well, as you can now share your photos directly into other’s photo streams, and vice versa.
* Camera in iOS 7 puts all your shooting formats — still, video, panorama, and now square — front and center. With a swipe, you can capture what you want the way you want. Fast. And new filters let you do even more with each image. Give it a retro feel. Dial up the contrast. Or go black and white. Artistic license is all yours.
* The updated Camera app is actually, as Apple dubs it, four cameras in one. With a swipe, you can go from the standard camera, to the video camera, to a square Instagram inspired camera, to the panoramic camera. Further showing the influence that Instagram has, you also have the ability to add one of several filters directly to the photos you take without using a third party app.
* Now there are faster, easier, and more delightful ways to scroll down memory lane. Introducing Collections, Moments, and Years — smart groupings of your photos and videos based on time and place. Tap Years and all your shots fill the screen. Each year holds Collections, like your trip to San Francisco. And in that Collection are distinct Moments — photos from Union Square, videos from AT&T Park. So you can find a shot from whenever, wherever, in no time.

* Sharing photos is a big deal in iOS 7 as well, and out of the box it looks as if it supports several ways to share. There’s, of course, Twitter, Mail, and Facebook, along with a new AirDrop option. iCloud photo sharers will be happy to hear that for the very first time, there’s video sharing included as well.

* What do you think about the update Photos and Camera apps? It’s a pretty big departure from the look and feel of the current version of iOS, wouldn’t you agree?
