* If you’re using the Electra1131 jailbreak on your iOS 11.2-11.3.1 device, then you may want to consider opening Cydia and installing the newest updates to Substitute and Tweak Injector as soon as you humanly can.
* These updates, which were issued by the Electra Team on Friday, implement an official ‘Safe Mode’ on devices that have been pwned with the Electra1131 jailbreak tool.

* When something triggers Safe Mode on your jailbroken device, you can expect to see the interface above.
* Just like Saurik’s Cydia Substrate and its complementary Safe Mode feature that came standard on many previous jailbreaks, the Electra Team’s new Safe Mode for Electra1131 protects your handset if a tweak bugs out or conflicts with another add-on you’ve installed.
* Safe Mode prevents respring and boot loop scenarios by providing you with a way out and letting you get to Cydia or Sileo to uninstall the problematic jailbreak tweak(s) so that you can return to a stable jailbroken state.
* Have you installed these critical updates on your jailbroken iOS 11.2-11.3.1 device yet? Let us know in the comments below.
