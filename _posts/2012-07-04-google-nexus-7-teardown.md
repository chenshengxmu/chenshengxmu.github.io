* Despite being only one millimeter thicker, Google’s upcoming Nexus 7 slate is more repairable than the new iPad, a teardown analysis by iFixit has concluded. Its components are assembled using standard tools, unlike the new iPad’s innards which are glued together.
* A simpler assembly makes servicing the Google tablet fairly easy with standard plastic opening tools that make “cracking the Nexus shell like cutting through butter”…
* Compared to iFixit’s teardown of the new iPad, the Google tablet wins handily in the repairability department with a nice seven out of ten score. This compares to the Kindle Fire’s impressive eight out of ten repairability score versus just two out of ten for the new iPad.
* Unfortunately, the LCD assembly doesn’t separate from the Corning display glass, making the cost of repairing shattered glass high because one will need to replace the whole display assembly, LCD included.
* As for the battery inside the Nexus 7 (also quite trivial to replace), it’s a 4326 mAh, 16 Wh package that can last 9:49 hours.
* The Kindle Fire, by comparison, has a 4400 mAh, 16.28 Wh battery – but only lasts 7:42 hours. Go figure.
* The new iPad boasts a significantly larger battery which has a 11,500 mAh and lasts 9:52 hours for HSPA (9:37 hours for LTE). It’s worth pointing out Google’s product has no cellular connectivity, which helps with battery performance.

* Component winners include:
*  • Hynix provides 1 GB of H5TC2G83CFR DDR3 RAM, the same unit found inside the new Retina MacBook Pro • Hydis makes the 7-inch, 1280×800 HD display model number HV070WX2 • Nvidia T30L Tegra 3 processor •  Hynix HTC2G83CFR DDR3 RAM • Max 77612A inverting switching regulator • AzureWave AW-NH665 wireless module • Broadcom BCM4751 integrated monolithic GPS receiver • NXP 65N04 Integrated NFC Chip • Invensense MPU-6050 gyro and accelerometer
* It’s also worth knowing that iFixit sells servicing kits and that their CEO Kyle Wiens is quite an advocate for serviceable hardware.
* Google’s tablet was co-developed with Asus and comes in 8GB/16GB varieties, priced at $199/$249.
* Key components include NFC, WiFi, GPS, a seven-inch 1280-by-800 pixel resolution backlit display with 216 pixels per inch and IPS technology for wide viewing angles, a quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 chip with 1GB of RAM, a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera for video calling (sorry, no rear-facing camera) and Android 4.1 Jelly Bean software.
* The full feature list is available here.
* Here’s a video overview of the teardown.
* The Nexus 7 was met with praise as journalists deemed it the most sleek, fluid and feature-complete seven incher to date.
* Although Apple hasn’t attempted to assert patent infringement (yet), Nokia has gone out on a limb asserting the Nexus 7 violates its patents, but refused to tell whether legal proceedings were in the works.
* WSJ and Bloomberg both gave credence this week to whispers that Apple is getting ready to mass manufacture a smaller and cheaper iPad in September, presumably to take on Google’s and Amazon’s device in the run-up to the holiday.
* I wonder what’s your next tablet going to be?
