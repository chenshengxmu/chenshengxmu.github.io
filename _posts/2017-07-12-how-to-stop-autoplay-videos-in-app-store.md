* iOS 11 brought out the biggest redesign to App Store since its inception in 2008, featuring a blog-like format with updated layout and promotional video trailers (Apple calls them app previews) that automatically play as you scroll through the new Today, Apps and Games tabs.
* Auto-playing app previews are nice unless you’re browsing the store while your iPhone is connected to your carrier’s cellular data network, especially if on a metered plan.
* You can disable autoplay videos altogether or have App Store load them via Wi-Fi only.
* Here’s how…
* Before we get to it, you don’t need to do anything unless your device runs iOS 11 or later because App Store on older iOS editions never plays app previews automatically.
* 1) Launch the Settings app on your device.
* 2) Choose iTunes & App Store from the list.
* 3) Tap Auto-Play Videos, which will put up a trio of options that make it easy for you to decide how app previews behave while you’re browsing the store.
* 4) Choose among the following options:
* To disable the feature altogether, choose the Off option.
* This shall stop autoplay app previews in App Store, saving you from unnecessarily wasting your expensive cellular data. Don’t you worry, app pages will still show a thumbnail for the app preview under the screenshots section.

* A single tap on the thumbnail prompts App Store to start playing the app preview.
