* Apple’s patent filings are usually more indicative of the company’s aspirations in terms of the technologies they seek to protect rather than possible future products.
* With that in mind, The United States Patent & Trademark Office on Tuesday granted Apple an interesting patent on advanced automotive control by linking your iPhone to your vehicle through Bluetooth.
* Originally filed in the fourth quarter of 2001, the U.S. Patent No. 8,947,202 titled “Accessing a vehicle using portable devices” outlines a bunch of possibilities achieved by  pairing your iPhone with your car, such as unlocking the doors or a storage compartment, starting the engine, activating the entertainment system, GPS and the car’s dashboard console remotely.
* It mentions other possible features, too.
* For example, your iPhone could help turn on a vehicle’s passenger compartment lights, adjust its seats, turn on the headlights, open a vehicle’s sun roof or windshield wipers, activate the automatic parking system and built-in wireless communication systems and more.

* The range of functionalities described above is heavily dependent on the car’s built-in sensors. The patent even details personalizing the in-car environment through your iPhone, including such settings as seat and mirror position, temperature controls and similar.
* Your iPhone would need to send access credentials to your vehicle’s sub-system in order to enable these features. Though the document does not mention it, Touch ID would be an ideal fit from the security standpoint.
* The connections between devices and the vehicle can be based on a short-range wireless protocol, such as Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE, proposes the document.
* The invention credits Apple engineers Brian Tucker, Emily Schubert, Jesse Dorogusker, Joakim Linde and Stephen Chick.
* A total of 45 Apple patent grants were published today by the USPTO, among them an invention covering electronic devices having displays with openings.
* Keep in mind that Apple owns several other patents related to cars.
* For instance, one describes using the iPhone’s location services and geo-fencing to automatically heat up your car’s interior when you’re walking up to it.
* Another invention combines the touch screen technology found in iPhones and iPads with haptic feedback, allowing drivers to adjust dashboard controls while keeping their eyes on the road.
* Oddly enough, the name “Apple Electric Car, Inc.” has surfaced in one of the patents related to a computer system for an electric golf cart, though unrelated to Apple.
