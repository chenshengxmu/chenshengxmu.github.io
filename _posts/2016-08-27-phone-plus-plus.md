* If you’ve got a jailbroken iPhone, then it’s time to supercharge that stock calling app with a new jailbreak tweak called Phone++.
* In this review, we’ll show you how Phone++ can improve access to your contacts from your favorite social apps and make your life easier.
* When you use the basic Phone app on your iPhone, you can typically get in touch with them in various ways, such as by calling them, placing a FaceTime call, starting an iMessage conversation with them, and even emailing them. The only thing you have to live with is you have to physically open their contact card and then scroll around to find the contact information you want to use.
* Phone++ tries to make things a little easier by bringing new swipe gestures to the Phone app to make contacting your contacts in various ways quicker and easier. Even more, it integrates with various third-party services, such as Skype and WhatsApp.
* The tweak accomplishes this by letting you swipe left or right on specific contacts or recent calls throughout the Phone app. This reveals an onset of buttons that provide different options:

* Some of the options you’ll see are the ones that the Phone app already supports prior to installing the tweak, but this tweak cleans it all up and puts it into a nice and sexy swipe gesture to make accessibility easier.
* The tweak is fully customizable, so you can actually modify the way it looks. Here, we have a different skin applied, and the screenshot also shows the shortcuts to third-party clients like Skype and WhatsApp in addition to stock ones.

* When you install Phone++, you can start using it immediately, but you may want to head over the Settings app to customize it how you like before you start getting used to it.

* Here, you can enable or disable the tweak’s features for various tabs in the Phone app, including Favorites, Recents, and even your Contacts. You’ll also find options for configuring appearance, swipe configurations, and gesture configurations.

* From the appearance pane, you can change the way the buttons look. This includes choosing between round or rectangular icons, having a border or not, and even minimalizing the entire interface.
* From the swipe configurations pane, you will be able to configure both right and left swipes on various contacts and recents that are shown in the Phone app. You can also configure long swipes to perform actions without even having to fully open the Phone++ interface, and have that colored a custom way.
* The gestures pane lets you add additional gestures for tapping and long presses, which compliment the swipe gestures. The gestures can be set to a specific action, such as calling, using Skype, or using another service to get in touch with the contact. This is useful if you use a specific type of contact method for a specific contact often and just want a quick shortcut to it.
* Overall, what you have here is a jailbreak tweak that tries to implement speedier shortcuts into the stock Phone app for getting in touch with your contacts and recent calls. It does a great job of sticking with Apple-like gesture guidelines, and its customization options mean you can get it to look just how you want it to.
* This tweak will come in handy if you’re looking for an all-in-one way to contact your favorite people at the right time, and now it’s fully compatible with iOS 9.x.x.
* If you’re interested in trying Phone++, you can download it on your jailbroken device from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now for $4.99.
