* Apple has cut the price of its Apple TV from $99 to $69, following the announcement of HBO Now coming exclusively to the Apple TV in April.
* “We would like to make it accessible to more people,” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, said during the company’s “Spring Forward” media event on Monday.
* It looks like Apple is making a bigger commitment to Apple TV. HBO Now, which got stage time during the media event, will cost $14.99 a month and include HBO’s entire catalogue of TV and movie content — no cable subscription required.
