* Piggy-backing on Tuesday’s unveiling of the iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display, the agile T-Mobile USA immediately tweeted out they’ll be carrying cellular models with a free 200MB plan. Today, the Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier, the nation’s fourth-largest, has shed more light on its iPad strategy.
* Your key takeaway: there will be no downpayment for those in the market for a cellular iPad Air or Retina iPad mini variant. However, the no-downpayment bait applies only to the entry-level models with sixteen gigabytes of storage. The full breakdown of T-Mobile’s UnCarrier offering is right below…
* 32GB/64GB iPads still require a downpayment.
* For example, the 16/32GB iPad Air/Retina iPad mini models are available with a downpayment of $99/$199. Though T-Mobile doesn’t require a downpayment for the entry-level 16GB iPads, you’ll be paying off your hardware through monthly installments.
* In the case of the 16GB iPad Air, you’ll be paying $26.25 per month over 24 months, or $22.08 for the iPad mini Retina display. The original iPad mini is $17.91 a month over 24 months, with no downpayment.
* These monthly installments pretty much work out to Apple’s retail pricing.
* For example, the 16GB iPad Air will ultimately set you back $630 (24 monthly payments of $26.25). As for the 16GB Retina iPad mini, 24 monthly payments of $22.08 work out to $530, matching Apple’s asking price.
* Other totals: the 32GB/64GB iPad Air is $729.99/$829.99, the 32GB/64GB Retina iPad mini is $629.91/$729.91 and the original 16GB iPad mini 16 is $429.99.
* Should you cancel your wireless service, the remaining balance on device becomes due.
* Again, all of these prices are for cellular iPad models.

* T-Mobile’s press release states that every T-Mobile iPad user will receive 200 MB of free 4G LTE data for life – that is, “for as long as they own their iPad, even if they aren’t yet a T-Mobile customer”.
* Other plans are available as well:
* For T-Mobile voice customers, ‘always-on’ iPad plans start at just $10 a month for unlimited data including 500 MB of 4G LTE data each month. Customers can add even more 4G LTE data in 2 GB increments for just $10 more per month.
* For customers who would rather have the flexibility of on-demand data, T-Mobile offers daily and weekly passes. Daily passes include unlimited data with 500 MB of 4G LTE data starting at just $5. The weekly passes include unlimited data with 1 GB of 4G LTE data for $10. No caps. No overages. Just simple value.
* The iPad Air will land on Apple and carrier store shelves on November 1 in a few dozen countries. As for the Retina iPad mini model, Apple has not set release date yet beyond the vague “coming late in November” statement on its website.
* Cody has detailed information on pricing and availability.
