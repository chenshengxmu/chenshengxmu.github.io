* Judging by the growing number of part leaks coming our way, production of Apple’s iPhone 6 should be moving full steam ahead. Coming straight out of China from a pretty reliable source, past two weeks have brought us purported iPhone 6 back cover parts, as well as the inner shell.
* Now the same source has posted additional shots depicting what appears to be a front as well as back iPhone part, photographed next to an iPhone 5s for a nice design comparison…
* Pictured top of post: the front part comparison.
* Notice the skinnier side bezels relative to the iPhone 5/5s and the smaller top/bottom surface due to the 4.-7 inch screen taking up more space.
* Moreover, the hole for the front-facing camera appears to be bigger, possibly indicating a much improved FaceTime camera for crisper selfies.
* The device doesn’t appear oversized pictured next to the current four-inch iPhone 5/5s so who knows, the design solutions might allow for one-handed use.
* Right below: the back part.

* The shots were posted on Chinese micro-blogging service Weibo by user DreamerJimmy. The same guy has been right on the money with genuine part leaks ahead of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c launches, by the way.
* Your key takeaway should be that these latest images seemingly corroborate much of the previous leaks.
* Provided the photos are genuine and not representative of someone’s vision of what the iPhone 6 should look like (or an abandoned prototype), the iPhone 6 will have a more accentuated two-tone design compared to the iPhone 5/5s.
* More images of the assumed aluminum chassis come via the French blog NowhereElse.fr [Google translate]. As seen below, the photographs appear to depict a back part much resembling Apple’s existing unibody design for the iPhone 5/5s chassis, with most of the holes and inlays in the right places.

* We can again see the circular camera flash hole as opposed to the current pill-shaped opening for Apple’s Tru-Tone flash on the iPhone 5s.
* Either Apple’s engineers have found a way to combine the two flashes on the iPhone 5s into one module or the iPhone 6 reverts back to a single-flash design, which I find hard to believe.
* At any rate, these images – provided they’re genuine, of course, do seem to indicate that production of iPhone 6 unibody enclosures is now running at full speed, ahead of the purported September launch.
* Chinese media (via GForGames) reported yesterday that Apple’s suppliers have already started churning out printed circuit boards (PCB), with about a hundred million units planned for both iPhone variants.
* Next month, Apple’s contract manufacturers are thought to start assembling components, with Japan’s Ibiden, Austria’s AT&S, California’s TTM Technologies and Taiwan’s Compeq all identified as the iPhone 6 PCB suppliers.
* The same report claims that the aforementioned any-layer PCB suppliers are on a tight schedule because of the “huge amount of units” ordered by Apple.
* We still can’t tell for sure whether or not the two new iPhone models will launch simultaneously, mirroring last year’s double-iPhone (5s/5c) launch.
* Last we heard, Apple has apparently solved production issues regarding thin batteries and display panels for the bigger 5.5-inch model so there’s some hope that the device could go on sale in September alongside its 4.7-inch counterpart, albeit in limited quantities.
