* Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far the biggest giveaway that we’ve done at iDownloadBlog, and we’re inviting you to participate.
* Yes, we’re giving away a 3rd generation iPad to one fortunate reader. Why buy a new iPad when you can get one for absolutely free?
* All you have to do is follow a few instructions and you’ll be entered to win. The winner will be announced next Friday. Check inside for more details…
* Step 1: Like this post on Facebook, and like our Facebook page.
* Step 2: Subscribe to our YouTube channel, and post a comment on the video with your thoughts and your Twitter or Facebook ID. We’d also appreciate it if you gave a thumbs up to our video, though that has no bearing on the giveaway.
* Step 3: Follow us on Twitter and retweet this post.
* If you successfully perform those 3 steps, then consider yourself entered to win.
* If you don’t have Facebook or Twitter, remember those services are free to sign up. It’s worth it when you consider that you can win a new ipad for free.
* This giveaway is open to international readers, and we will handle the shipping cost involved as a courtesy to you.
* We really love our readers and the awesome support that you have shown us over the years. We wish we could give an iPad to each and every one of you, but this is the next best thing.
* Have you entered yet? A winner that meets all of the requirements will be randomly selected next Friday, March 23rd, 2012.
