* iOS 11.3 brought a laundry list of new features to iPhone and iPad today, including iMessages in iCloud, new Animoji, new health features, ARKit enhancements and more. Among those is support for AirPlay 2.
* The public release of AirPlay 2 has been delayed, but it appears we are getting our first taste of the feature with this first beta of iOS 11.3 and tvOS 11.3.
* After updating multiple Apple TVs to the latest beta, we are now able to stream audio to multiple devices at the same time.
* Currently, you are limited to devices running the latest betas, but when released, third-party speakers as well as the HomePod will support it.

* After updating your Apple TV to tvOS 11.3, it will now work with HomeKit, and appear in the Home app on your iOS device. Right after the update, you are asked to choose a room from your HomeKit setup to assign the Apple TV.
* UPDATE
* Weâ€™ve spent some time playing with AirPlay 2 on our Apple TVs and iOS devices. While it certainly is buggy in this first beta, it shows some exciting promise.
