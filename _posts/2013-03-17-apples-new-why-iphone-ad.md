* Apple this weekend launched a new advertising campaign for the iPhone showcasing some of the many reasons why the handset is so popular. It’s added a new ‘Why iPhone’ page to its website, and has begun sending out promotional emails.
* The ‘Why iPhone’ page highlights a number of the device’s features including its Retina display, the iTunes ecosystem, iCloud and more, and the fact that it’s won 8 J.D. Power and Associate awards and it’s the most popular camera in the world…
* From Apple’s website:
* “What makes an iPhone unlike anything else? Maybe it’s that it lets you do so many things. Or that it lets you do so many things so easily. Those are two reasons iPhone owners say they love their iPhone. But there are many others as well.”
* Apple’s new iPhone push comes just a few days after Samsung introduced its latest flagship handset, the Galaxy S4, which was unveiled on Thursday to much fanfare. It also follows Phil Schiller’s recent round of Android-slamming interviews.
* Earlier this month, Schiller, who is Apple’s SVP of marketing, raised some eyebrows when he tweeted out a link to a mobile malware report that bashed Google’s OS for its lack of security. And he continued that aggressive trend last week in a round of interviews with The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others
* Some folks are saying that Apple, for the first time since it launched its iPhone, is going on the defensive against its competitors. Others believe this is just the beginning of a long overdue aggressive marketing approach for the Cupertino company.
* What do you make of all of this?
