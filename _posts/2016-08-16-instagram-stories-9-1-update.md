* Instagram’s new Stories feature caused quite a stir as some users took issue with the fact that the Facebook-owned photo sharing service basically ripped off Snapchat Stories. Be that as it may, Instagram’s iPhone application, which is available at no charge on the App Store, has just received a nice update which packs in a few useful camera-related improvements to the Stories feature.
* According to release notes accompanying the update, you can now zoom with one hand as you’re recording a video: just slide your finger up and down while holding the video record button.
* If you ever wanted to switch camera mode while recording a video, now you can—simply double-tap to flip between the front and back camera. Instagram 9.1 for iOS also includes lots of bug fixes and improvements to make Stories even better and faster.

* For those new to Instagram Stories, the feature is a lot like Snapchat Stories in that users can share all or some of the moments of their day, not just the ones they’ve elected to keep on their profile.
* As you share multiple photos and videos, they appear together in an auto-dissapearing slideshow format. If you haven’t tried Instagram Stories yet, give it a whirl as it’s a really nicely done, compelling new feature.
* To help get you up to speed with Instagram Stories, Sebastien has put together a nice tutorial explaining how to add photos and videos from the iPhone’s Camera roll to your Instagram Story.
* Download Instagram for free from the App Store.
