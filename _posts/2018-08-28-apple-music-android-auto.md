* Apple is beta-testing a new version of the Music app for Android which adds in Android Auto support for the first time. Android Auto is the search giant’s CarPlay-like system that mirrors qualified apps from a smartphone to a vehicle’s display.
* As reported Tuesday by AndroidPolice, Android Auto integration is available to those who request access to the 2.6 beta via Google Groups. After your request has been approved, you’ll need to download the latest beta from Apple Music’s page on Play Store.
* Once that’s done, you’ll have to wait for the beta to roll to your device before choosing Apple Music as a source in Android Auto and controlling playback as you do with other music apps.
* Version 2.6 includes the following changes:
* You can also grab the installer from APK Mirror.
* Just like CarPlay, Android Auto integration permits the Music app running on an Android-based smartphone to be mirrored to your vehicle’s infotainment screen. Users can see what’s currently playing, control music playback through a head unit and more.
* Chromecast or Google Home integration is still non-existent though.
