* Volkswagen has finally announced it will rollout Apple’s CarPlay software in its vehicles sometime in 2015, a year late to the party when it was noticeably absent from the list of initial CarPlay supporters. The European automaker made the announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday, saying CarPlay will be alongside its rivals.
* Later this year, Volkswagen will introduce the second generation of its MIB II infotainment software in the US. Within MIB II, users will be able to choose if they want to use CarPlay, Android Auto, or MirrorLink, a technology supported by Sony.
* Simultaneously, Volkswagen will also launch CarPlay and Android Auto in the European market, the automaker said.
* CarPlay will work with all Lightning-enabled iPhones (currently the 5, 5C, 5S, 6 / 6 Plus), allowing users to access Siri: Eyes Free mode, Apple Maps, telephone, music, and iMessage from their in-car dash. Right now, Volkswagen is touting MIB II (and subsequently CarPlay) in its Golf automobile.
* Volkswagen hasn’t announced specifics for when the software will rollout. The automaker is now joining a long list of others promising CarPlay, including BMW, the Chrysler Group, GM, Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Ford, and more.
