* Hot on the heels of Microsoft’s Office for iPad release, Apple has updated its iWork for iCloud apps with a number of improvements. The web versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote have each received new features, and it looks the changes will soon be hitting the Mac and iOS apps as well.
* As a group, all three apps have been updated with Retina display support, as well as the ability to share view-only documents and the option to open documents directly from iCloud Mail. Individually, each app has received updated designs for their respective editors and other enhancements…

* As noted by 9to5Mac, a pop-up indicates that more iWork updates are coming:
* “We’re updating Pages everywhere! We’ll update Pages for Mac and iOS later today. You’ll need those updates to open documents you edit in Pages for iCloud.”
* We aren’t seeing these updates in the App Store yet, but we’ll let you know when they arrive.
* In January, Apple updated all three iWork apps across all platforms with better iOS 7 support, new features and bug fixes. If you want to see today’s iCloud changes for yourself, simply visit iCloud.com on your computer or iOS device and sign in with your Apple ID. This is free for all iOS users.
