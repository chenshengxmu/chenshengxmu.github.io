* The App Store application has just been updated to show your purchase history and to allow you to download any application that is not installed on the device.
* When you go to the “Updates” section of your App Store app application, you will now see a “Purchased” button. This will take you to a list of all the applications you have ever purchased. You can also select the “Not on This iPhone” option to see apps that have been downloaded to your other iDevices…
* You can then easily redownload to your device effortlessly, and completely free of charge.
* You need to be on iOS 4.3.1 or above to enjoy this new feature.
* How do you like this new option? Quite handy, isn’t it?
