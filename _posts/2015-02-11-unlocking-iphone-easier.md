* The process of unlocking your iPhone became a little bit easier today in the United States. Today marks the deadline for wireless carriers to adopt the unlocking standards of the late-2013 agreement set forth by the CTIA.
* The agreement is industry-wide, and mandates that carriers adhere to 6 rules including clearly posting their unlocking policies online, and offering to unlock postpaid handsets once the customer’s contract has expired.
* Here are the 6 rules, as outlined by The Wireless Association:
* Most major carriers already have many of these policies in place, but today’s deadline will force them into a standard. It’s unknown what the punishment for non-compliance is, however it doesn’t seem like that will be an issue.
* The practice of unlocking essentially became illegal in 2013, when the DMCA exemption that allowed it expired. The issue has since been taken up by the Federal Communications Commission, and various folks in Washington D.C.
* In August of last year, President Obama signed a bill reinstating the DMCA exemption, making it legal for cellphone owners to unlock their devices—particularly without the intervention of carriers—for at least the next three years.
