* At iDB we strive to offer a comprehensive and deep catalogue of tutorials for readers of all skill levels, which is the reason why a brief workshop on pairing your wireless earbuds or external Bluetooth speakers is still in order. If you are already well-versed in this procedure, more power to you. You can probably sit this exercise out.
* However if you are new to Apple Watch or have recently managed to grab your first cord free headset, these are the steps that get you ready to jam out to the music stored right on your wrist:
* 1) Get your Bluetooth headset or Bluetooth speaker in range and make sure they can be discovered by other devices.
* 2) Click your Digital Crown and open Settings on your watch.

* 3) Inside Settings, tap Bluetooth.

* 4) When your headset or speaker is switched on and set to be paired, it is going to show up in the list of Bluetooth devices reading Not Paired. Devices already registered with your watch will say Not Connected. Touch the new device once to pair.

* 5) Both Apple Watch and your device will start communicating and link up. When successful, the text field will shift from Not Paired to Connected.
* You’re good to go!

* Note that in the future, you do not have to return to the Bluetooth settings every time you pick up your wireless headset again. If your device has been paired with Apple Watch before, you simply switch it on and initiate the music on your watch. Just before the selected track starts rolling, a pretty straightforward pop-up is going to ask you to select a device from your list of previously paired speakers. Click the desired gadget and the connection is going to be re-established:
