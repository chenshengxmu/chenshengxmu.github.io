* Leading drone manufacturer DJI late Tuesday introduced two new Osmo accessories for iPhone at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: the Osmo Mobile Silver and the Osmo Zenmuse M1. The former is a silver edition of DJI’s already popular gimbal stabilizer, and the latter is a smartphone mount for the original Osmo stabilizer.
* The Osmo Mobile turns a smartphone into a smart motion camera, giving creators the tool to effortlessly create cinematic videos. The new Osmo Mobile Silver was created with lifestyle in mind and shares the same high-quality build and ergonomic design found in the rest of the Osmo family. Using the DJI GO app, users can track their subject automatically, create motion timelapses, take dramatic long exposures, make 9-shot panoramas, and livestream their story to social media.
* Further enhancements have been added to the Osmo Mobile Silver to make every moment you shoot look smooth, professional and ready to share. A new Beautify mode uses automatic identification and intelligent processing technologies inside the DJI GO app, allowing users to do minor touch ups and give their videos that perfect, professional sheen. The Osmo Mobile Silver will also work with FiLMiC Pro, a professional filmmaking mobile app that gives creators more flexibility and creative freedom with their handheld device.
* DJI says high efficiency and capacity batteries give the Osmo Mobile Silver a maximum run times of 4.5 hours. It’s compatible with a range of smartphones, from 2.3-3.3-inches in width, and it will start shipping in the second half of January for $299. The Zenmuse M1 gimbal also starts shipping in late January for $169.
* Here’s our review of the Osmo Mobile Black:
* Other DJI CES announcements include a new Chinese New Year Edition of its popular Phantom 4 quadcopter, an ultra-bright portable ‘CrystalSky Monitor’ display for folks that shoot a lot of aerial photography, and a new iPad app called Ground Station Pro that allow professional pilots to plan and control autonomous flights for DJI aircraft.
