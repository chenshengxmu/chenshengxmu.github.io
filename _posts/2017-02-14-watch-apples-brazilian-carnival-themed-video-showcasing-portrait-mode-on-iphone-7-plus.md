* Following a pair of iPhone 7 Plus ads showcasing the depth of field shooting mode made possible by the dual-lens camera on iPhone 7 Plus, Apple shared another video on its Brazilian YouTube channel
* First spotted by local blog Blogdoiphone, the video runs one minute and thirty seconds long and serves as the celebration of the Brazillian Carnaval festivities.
* Apple has created the clip to showcase “the diversity, variety and freedom of expression of Carnaval,” the publication notes. “The beauty and joy of the carnaval gets even more prominent with the new Portrait Mode of iPhone 7 Plus,” reads the video’s description.
* The clip showcases some of the more than 500 photographs taken with the dual-lens camera of iPhone 7 Plus, using the Portrait feature in the Camera app. The individual images were then combined together into a video presentation.
* The video uses a song by BaianaSystem and Yzalú, available on Apple Music.
