title: 'Aero' now available for download on Cydia
---
* Aero is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to switch apps in style via custom animations. We’ve already had some significant hands-on time with Aero last week, and we were excited by what we saw.
* Aero adds a whole host of custom animations that allow you to switch between apps in very unique ways. It’s a tweak designed by SBCoders, the same folks behind Deck, so you know it’s quality.
* If you’ve been waiting on pins and needles for Aero’s release, then wait no more; Aero can be downloaded from Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $1.99. What do you think?
