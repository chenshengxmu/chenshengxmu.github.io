* SwipeCam is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows you to use your Lock screen camera toggle as a gateway to more options.
* SwipeCam only works with the old Lock screen camera interface, so that means devices below iOS 5.1.
* Once the tweak is installed, simply enabled it, invoke your Lock screen camera shortcut, and swipe on the camera icon to reveal the additional toggles…
* The tweak has yet to be released on Cydia, but as of this writing there were only two toggles available for use — Airplane Mode and WiFi.
* At the tweak’s reported $1.49 asking price, I have to admit that it’s pretty steep considering the amount of options you get.
* SwipeCam should be available for download tomorrow on Cydia. Be sure to share your thoughts about the tweak below.
