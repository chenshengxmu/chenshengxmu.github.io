* One of the most common issues with Apple’s all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro desktop machines is that all the ports you care about are along the back. It works aesthetically, but functionally it can be frustrating. Enter the new USB-C clamp hub from Satechi.
* This aluminum USB Type-C hub brings several ports right to the iMac front.
* The versatile accessory plugs into one of the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the rear of your iMac or iMac Pro and attaches to the vents on the underside of the computer. That’s quite an ingenious way to mount the hub—it looks nearly seamless from the front. The new Satechi gadget is also small enough that the mild blocking of the vent won’t make a difference.

* It gives you an SD/Micro SD card reader, three USB Type-A ports and a USB Type-C port.
* Speaking as an iMac owner, it’s always frustrating to turn your monitor around or try to feel out the ports with the pads of your fingers. Satechi makes it not only easy to access the commonly used ports, but it does so without adding unnecessary wires and clutter to your desk.

* When you do have a quartet of things plugged in, it can make your desk look a bit messy as the cords are coming out right at you. If you use Satechi’s new hub for quick and temporary items, it’s hands down easier to use than the rear ports.
* If you’d like to pick up one for yourself, it comes in both Silver and Space Gray to match the iMac or iMac Pro aesthetics. Amazon has them in stock and ready to ship for $49.99.
* How do you like this elegantly designed accessory?
