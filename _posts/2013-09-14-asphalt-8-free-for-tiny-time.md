* Great news gamers! Gameloft has made its recently-released ‘Asphalt 8: Airborne’ game free for a limited time. The developer made the announcement yesterday via its Twitter account, saying that the title would be free through the weekend.
* Asphalt 8, which as the name suggests is the eighth installment in the popular racing series, made its debut just a few weeks ago in late August. The game features over 40 licensed cars, an extensive Career mode, and an all-new physics engine…
* Touch Arcade gave Asphalt 8 a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars:
* “When you combine that with the impressive graphical sheen and the large amount of available content, I can’t really think of a reason why you shouldn’t check outAsphalt 8. The iOS platform has quietly become a haven for great racers, and Asphalt 8 looks to be leading the pack right now.”
* And CNET gave it an ‘Excellent’ rating at 4 out of 5 stars:
* “Asphalt 8: Airborne is the best arcade racing game I’ve played in a while and the best so far in the franchise. With tons of cool cars to unlock, tracks with several shortcuts and alternate routes, and high-speed, flipping-through-the-air, nitro-boosted racing action, this game is great for a quick adrenaline rush.”
* Still not convinced? Here’s the official gameplay trailer:
* Sure, Asphalt 8: Airborne is normally just $0.99, and it does have some IAPs—though they aren’t required like they are in free-to-play titles. But we still think that at $0, it’s worth downloading. To find the universal game in the App Store, click here.
* Will you be picking up Asphalt 8 this weekend?
