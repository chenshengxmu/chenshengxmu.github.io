* Feeling nostalgic? Own an iPad 2 or an iPhone 4s? Then you have the opportunity to travel back down memory lane and downgrade your device from any firmware back to iOS 6.1.3—no SHSH blobs required.
* Entitled odysseusOTA, the command line tool takes advantage of the fact that Apple is still signing the OTA (over the air) firmwares for iOS 6.1.3 on the iPad 2 and iPhone 4s. Want to see the downgrade in action? Then watch this detailed step-by-step video.
* The downgrade method is the work of developer tihmstar, with additional credit going to winocm (kloader), xerub (odysseus), and iH8sn0w (consulting) among others.
* Obviously this downgrade method will have extremely limited use-case scenarios, as it is strictly limited to the  aforementioned firmware/hardware combos. Nonetheless, it is an impressive (no SHSH blobs needed!) feat, when you consider how difficult Apple makes it to downgrade firmware these days.
* What do you think? Do you have an old iPhone 4s or iPad 2 laying around? Would you consider trying odysseusOTA?
