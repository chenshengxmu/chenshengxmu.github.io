* With high profile hacking incidents making headlines now on what seems like a weekly basis, people are starting to think more about their online security. And one of the first questions they tend to ask is: how safe is my password at [insert name] website?
* Password-management company Dashlane just released a report that may help answer this question for many users. The firm has conducted a comprehensive study of the top 100 e-commerce websites, based on 24 criteria, and here’s what they found out…
* Apple.com was the only site to receive a perfect score of 100, which again is based on criteria like whether the site accepts weak passwords. Microsoft and academic supplier Chegg tied for second at 65, along with Newegg, and Target came in third at 60.
* Here’s the top 10 and bottom 10 (via ArsTechnica):

* And here’s an excerpt from the press release on Apple:
* “Some retailers may argue that such requirements impede user convenience, but companies such as Apple, arguably the most famous brand on the list, have shown that it is possible to be both secure and successful. In every category we tested, Apple implemented the four simple policies and procedures we recommend above. The policies resulted in the company being awarded the only perfect score in the study.”
* Apple has been taken several steps in recent years to boost up the security of its site, including the addition of two-step verification. First introduced last spring, the process ensures that a person would not be able to use your password to login to your account.
