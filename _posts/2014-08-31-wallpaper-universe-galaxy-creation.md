* As the section is titled Wallpapers of the Week, it stands to reason we pick the best images we can find around the net on any given week. Today, there is a great selection of nebula and galaxy wallpapers, but I would not call them the most popular over the past seven days.
* Going back a few days, Apple announced the September 9 event for iPhone, and possibly a wearable device. The event, which is always a hyped occurrence, is gaining more excitement by hosting media at the Flint Center and building a whole separate structure to house something. All of this to say, if you missed the Apple announcement wallpapers earlier this week, make sure to check out the handy work of some great iDB readers.
* Alternatively, don’t miss the great colorful wallpapers in today’s post.
* This week is another set of great wallpapers featured by @iDeviceGFX. The account has been featured on the wallpaper section before as a place to find curated images for wallpapers. Today’s selection should continue to impress. Anytime we have posted galaxy-style images, they have been a big hit on the site. Consequently, we offer the following images in the same category.

* The wallpaper section is built on a weekly basis with images we find or stumble upon. However, the section also features the work of dedicated iDB readers, with a knack for graphic design. The Apple event wallpapers are a great example. If you have an eye for great wallpapers or have created some on your own, feel free to get in touch! You can find me most easily at @jim_gresham, or less often by jim@idownloadblog.com.
* As a tip or reminder to others, do not simply submit pictures from your family vacation. Pictures are not wallpapers. Wallpapers are edited and formatted specifically for iOS devices. The resolution and image size must be specific to the devices, to be considered for a post. They do not have to be your own creation, but if you send someone else’s work, please give them credit.
