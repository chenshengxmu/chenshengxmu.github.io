* Most of the time, your Mac just works—until it refuses to start up properly due to an unforeseen system error, a misbehaving app, a broken system component and what not. Beyond system errors, different people have different needs when it comes to starting up their computer.
* For example, you could be a pro user who dual boots between OS X and Windows on a daily basis. Others might be wondering about booting a Mac from a disk other than their designated startup disk. Or perhaps you’re looking to isolate the cause of a software issue in OS X’s Safe Mode or boot straight into Recovery OS as the last option?
* For those of you who have wondered about the many ways you can start up your Mac, here’s a quick list of the keyboard shortcuts you can invoke to access handy OS X features which are only available at boot time.
* To boot your Intel-based Mac into any of OS X’s built-in startup modes, you must press and hold one or more keys detailed below after turning on the computer. Press the keys immediately after hearing the startup sound, unless otherwise specified.
* Other keyboard shortcuts are available after your Mac has started up.
* Our ongoing tutorial series has covered many Mac startup modes thus far. To learn more about many of them, simply tap or click their linked names on the bulleted list above.
* On certain Mac notebook models, startup key combos may fail to register in certain situations. For instance, if you own an early-2015 twelve-inch MacBook model and have Apple’s Bluetooth keyboard connected to it, these key combinations won’t work on your wireless keyboard.
* The solution couldn’t be simpler: use the MacBook’s built-in keyboard to get to Startup Manager, Recovery Mode, Single User Mode, Safe Mode and other features that are available at boot time.
* Another option: hook up any standard USB keyboard to your Mac via a USB-C adapter.
* You shouldn’t turn the volume all the way down before restarting your Mac.
* Hearing startup tones other than the familiar startup chord is the first step in determining what might be causing hiccups that your computer is experiencing.
