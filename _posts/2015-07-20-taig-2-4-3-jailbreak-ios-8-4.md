* The TaiG team has officially released version 2.4.3 of its iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool for Windows. The update piggybacks off the beta version of the 2.4.3 release that was ushered in last week.
* Version 2.4.3 brings jailbreak optimization to the fore, and should theoretically result in a more stable and straightforward jailbreak experienced for its users. If you’ve yet to jailbreak, then we recommend using TaiG 2.4.3. You can find the full download in this post.
* Here is the full change log for TaiG 2.4.3:
* As you can see, there are no changes from the previous beta version of the release. Along with the jailbreak optimization, the latest version of Cydia Installer is included as well—version 1.1.23.
* You can download the TaiG 2.4.3 update from our downloads page.
* Although this tool is for Windows-only, you do have options if you run a Mac. First and foremost, you can use the virtual machine method to run TaiG on your Mac. You can also use a Bootcamp partition. The easiest, option, however, is to just use the PP Jailbreak tool for Mac. That tool was designed for the Mac, although TaiG claims that the PP team pilfered some of its code in the process.
* Above all things right now on the priority list is the need to protect your jailbreak. With iOS 8.4.1 looming, an update that is rumored to break the iOS 8.4 jailbreak, it’s imperative that users take proactive steps right now to preserve their device’s jailbreakability.
* What are your thoughts on TaiG’s release pattern and this latest update?
* Thanks, @iAdam1n
