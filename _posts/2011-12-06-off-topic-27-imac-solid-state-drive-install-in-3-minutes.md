* As you guys may know, my main job at iDownloadBlog is to create videos for everything from tweak and app reviews, to product reviews. Millions of people have watched our videos, and the amount of subscribers grow each day.
* Considering this, my primary editing machine was getting a bit long in the tooth; I needed something to pep it up to keep up with the demand of video tutorials and walkthroughs. I needed a Solid State Drive.
* But I wasn’t planning on going to Apple or buying a whole new iMac just for an SSD. Nope, I planned on doing this myself. It wasn’t easy, and at times it was downright frustrating. But I did it. To celebrate, I’ve created a video that showcases the entire 3 hour install in under 3 minutes…
* In the end, I’m so glad I did this, as my iMac is a million times faster now. Halfway through the process, I was starting to doubt myself, and second-guess my decision. The LCD is very heavy, and there are so many tiny screws and connectors that I felt like I might break something.
* Thankfully, I came out completely unscathed. In fact, I could probably do it again in less than an hour. Part of that is due to a handy tutorial I was able to find online. This tutorial by Brian Tobey is truly a life saver. If you’re at all interested in doing this feel free to ask me, but I highly recommend checking out the tutorial I referred to.
* So, what do you guys think? Did I make the right decision, or am I downright crazy for even attempting this? Thanks to Sebastien for convincing me to make this video!
