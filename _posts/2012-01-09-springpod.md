* Adding individual music controls to your Home screen in the form of app icons is nothing new in the world of jailbreaking. But SpringPod brings a slightly different approach, and few more customization options to the table than previous tweaks.
* Along with play/pause controls, SpringPod brings previous, next, rewind, fast forward, and volume functions directly to your iPhone’s Springboard. But is it worth the $0.99 asking price?
* Personally, I’d say no. I don’t listen to enough music as it is, and I definitely don’t like the idea of cluttering up my Springboard with a bunch of icons that I can easily invoke from the app switcher anyway.
* That’s not to say that there’s no one who would enjoy SpringPod. It does have some nice options, like the ability to theme the music controls with three built-in theme layouts. It also features Activator options for bringing up certain details about your ‘now playing’ track.
* Still, with all of the various ways we can interact with our Music app, even from a iOS default perspective, it’s hard to see where a tweak like SpringPod fits into the equation. I’m sure someone will find it useful, but it just wasn’t for me.
* What about you? How would you use SpringPod?
