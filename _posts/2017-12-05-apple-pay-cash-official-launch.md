* Apple has announced that Apple Pay for Messages and the Apple Pay Cash card are officially launching today. Yesterday, some users had begun to see the feature appear, but now it is widely available for everyone who is running the latest iOS 11.2 update.
* The new peer-to-peer payment service and digital debit card are available to users in the United States. The service allows you to easily send and receive money inside the Messages app, which you can then store on the Apple Pay Cash debit card or transfer to your bank.
* We went hands-on with the latest features for Apple Pay when it launched in beta.

* Apple Pay Cash launches after an extended beta period both in iOS 11.2, and internally in iOS 11.1. The feature is very cleanly built into iOS with support for the Messages app, QuickType keyboard suggestions, Apple Watch (via watchOS 4.2), and even Siri.
* Similar to Square Cash and Venmo, it is free to use as long as you fund it with a debit card. If you choose to use a credit card, you will incur a 3% fee for each transaction.

* Apple Pay Cash will be available for iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and later, Apple Watch, iPad Pro, iPad (5th Generation), iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 running iOS 11.2 or later. If you meet these requirements and it’s still not showing up for you, Apple recommends restarting your device.
