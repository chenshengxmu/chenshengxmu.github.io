* Today, we were able to get our hands on an early build of SMSPlus, a jailbreak tweak that significantly enhances the stock messages app.
* The big thing about SMSPlus is that it’s not a separate app like biteSMS or others, but it’s tightly integrated into the stock messages app, and made to look as stock as possible.
* There’s pull to sort functionality, quick reply, quick compose, text to speech, and a bevy of other things to uncover. Check inside for the full video preview…
* I also want to apologize for how jumpy and blurred out the video is at times. I wanted to block out my SMS messages and phone numbers, and that was the only realistic way to do so, yet still showcase most of the features.
* SMSPlus will be available soon from Filippo Bigarella for $1.99. What do you think?
