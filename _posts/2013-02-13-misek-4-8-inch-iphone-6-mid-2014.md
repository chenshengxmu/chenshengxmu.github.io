* Jeffries analyst Peter Misek is on a roll. First he wrote in a note issued to clients this morning that channel checks led him to believe that the iPhone 5S is entering production in March for a likely June/July introduction.
* Then word came that Misek thinks Apple could be holding a media event next month to announce a software development kit (SDK).
* The official SDK would enable programmers to write full-screen 1080p apps and games for the Apple TV set-top box. And now, we learn that Misek doesn’t see the 4.8-inch iPhone launching this year at all. Instead, Apple is looking to release a bigger iPhone in mid-2014, he writes…
* Note that DigiTimes reported last month that an iPhone with a bigger screen will launch in 2014.
* Misek was first to report back in December 2012 that a 4.8-inch iPhone was in the works and believed Apple would release it this summer.
* Again, citing channel checks, he claimed several iPhone 6 prototypes were floating around, with one model rocking a 4.8-inch screen.
* It has a Retina+ IGZO screen, a new A7 quad-core processor variant, and a new form factor with no home button. Full gesture control is also possibly included.
* In today’s note to clients relayed by MacRumors, Misek writes that the device won’t launch until mid-2014 because Apple wants to fully re-architect iOS to utilize more cores on the next-gen A7 chip.
* We think Apple plans to re-architect iOS to utilize more cores and better compete with Samsung. Also, we believe the way iOS interoperates with iCloud, gestures controls, and advertising will be substantially upgraded.
* Another reason: Apple allegedly wants to fab the A7 package on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) 20-nanometer process, but TSMC won’t ramp up this process technology before 2014.

* Apple’s current iPhone app processor is on 32nm. For the iPhone 6 we think Apple will likely skip over 28nm and go to 20nm to facilitate adding more cores (4 or even 8).
* While TSMC is targeting a 2014 ramp in its 20nm production we think that issues like double patterning could make it a more complicated transition than the 28nm ramp, which had its own substantial ramp and yield issues.
* The iPhone maker recently commissioned TSMC to run trial manufacturing of the A6X processor which debuted inside the iPad 4 last year. According to last month’s report  by DigiTimes Research, Apple contracted out manufacturing of a cutting-edge chip for a “breakthrough” device to TSMC.
* TSMC, the world’s largest independent semiconductor foundry, will invest $9 billion in capital expenditure this year and even more in 2014 as it moves toward the more advanced 20nm and 16nm process technologies.
* Finally, Misek writes that that the iPhone 6 will drop the in-cell display assembly process that the iPhone 5 adopted in favor of either on-cell OLED or Sharp’s IGZO panels, which offer twice the resolution at only ten percent power consumption of the traditional LCD screen.
* I guess Misek didn’t get the memo that Tim Cook trashed OLED tech during his Goldman Sachs keynote.
