* Apple has issued their first public statement regarding the design flaw present in nearly all computers and mobile devices.
* The comment comes in the form of a support document giving details in which devices are affected, what the vulnerabilities are, what they’ve done so far, and how you can protect yourself.
* Apple has clarified that all iOS and macOS devices are affected (including Apple TV). Apple Watch is not effected by Meltdown.
* While that is a significant number of devices to be vulnerable, Apple says users should not worry. Currently, there are no known exploits, and they are very difficult to take advantage of.
* They say that the issues can only be exploited when a malicious app is installed on your machine. To help protect yourself, Apple says to be sure to only download apps and software from trusted sources, (such as the App Store).
* They’ve also confirmed recent patches that came out in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2. These patches were aimed to address the Meltdown vulnerability and a new update for Safari will be out in the next couple days to address Spectre.
* We continue to develop and test further mitigations for these issues and will release them in upcoming updates of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
* Apple also attempted to quell fears of performance hits that were expected after the patch. They say they’ve run tests after the patch and saw no detrimental performance.
* Between the two vulnerabilities, Apple says Meltdown “has the the most potential to be exploited,” while Spectre is “extremely difficult” to exploit.
* Spectre
* Analysis of these techniques revealed that while they are extremely difficult to exploit, even by an app running locally on a Mac or iOS device, they can be potentially exploited in JavaScript running in a web browser. Apple will release an update for Safari on macOS and iOS in the coming days to mitigate these exploit techniques.
* If you would like to learn more about the exploits, or Apple’s response, you can read the full support document on Apple’s website.
