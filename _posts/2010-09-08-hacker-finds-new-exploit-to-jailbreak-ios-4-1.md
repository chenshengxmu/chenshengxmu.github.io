* Well well well. Here are some good news coming from MuscleNerd and co about a new exploit found by a hacker that goes by the name of pod2g. Apparently, pod2g found a bootrom exploit in iOS 4.0.1.
* Why should we care about 4.0.1, I hear you saying? Since it’s a bootrom exploit, it means Apple cannot patch the exploit with a software update. The only way to patch the hole would require a hardware modification. In other words, Apple won’t be able to prevent us from jailbreaking until the iPhone 5 comes out.
* Woohoo! So can we jailbreak iOS 4.1 yet? No, we can’t. As MuscleNerd said, there is a lot of work to be done. However I do feel confident we’re going to see a jailbreak for iOS 4.1 by the end of the month (that’s just me predicting – nothing’s sure).
* Isn’t that some exciting news?
