* Do you always use the scientific functions on iOS’ Calculator app? Do you find the standard calculator to be worthless without scientific functions? If so, then try LandscapeCalc.
* LandscapeCalc is a jailbreak tweak that locks the calculator’s orientation into landscape mode. After the first rotation from portrait to landscape, the calculator will never return back to the default orientation until the Calculator app is killed or stops running.
* This tweak is useful for those of you who are talking algebra courses in school. There are no options to configure, just install it and go.
* LandscapeCalc is a free jailbreak tweak available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Share your thoughts about the tweak in the comments below.
