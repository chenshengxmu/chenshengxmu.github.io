* These days, people don’t need wallets as much as they just need a pocket or two to hold a couple of credit cards and an ID. Even if you need to bring cash with you somewhere, chances are, you don’t need much.
* Mujjo’s Leather Wallet Case for the iPhone 6 is designed with a back pocket so you can carry just the essentials and leave the bulky wallet mess at home.
* Of course, this case is for the minimalist. Most people I know carry about a dozen business cards, plus credit cards, ID, insurance card, and more. This iPhone 6 wallet case is perfect for those looking to pare down what they carry around.
* It is also ideal for those nights when you know you won’t need everything in your wallet. Keep your purse clean or your pockets free by selecting just what you will need and placing it in the leather backside pocket for the night.
* The case is designed specially for the iPhone 6 and includes cutaways and holes for volume controls, headphone jack, Lightning connector, and the camera. The backside of the case has a slanted pocket for you to store your cards. The case is covered in vegetable-tanned leather for a soft look. It has also been waxed for a durable finish. The leather has been treated with aniline oil to bring out the color tones. The process gives the leather a worn-in look over time. The inside of the case is lined with suede.
* The Mujjo Leather Wallet Case for iPhone 6 is available on Amazon for $50 in tan, black, and gray. There is also a version for the iPhone 6 Plus with a slightly different design for $60.
