* On Google Chrome, as opposed to Safari, you can move multiple tabs at the same time to a new window by doing the following:
* 1) In Google Chrome, select the first tab.
* 2) Next, hold the ⌘ key.
* 3) Click on additional tabs you wish to move.

* 4) Release the ⌘ key.
* 5) Drag the tabs to a new window or out of the current window to create a new one.
* Yes, it’s that easy.
* Unfortunately, there’s no easy way in Safari to perform a similar task, although Macworld has come up with a convoluted alternative you might want to try. As it explains:
