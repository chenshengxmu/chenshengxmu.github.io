* Apparently, the Chronic Dev Team is having issues making GreenPois0n work on Mac and it might take a few days to get it done. Stay tuned as weâ€™ll keep you informed when it comes out.
* In the meanwhile, you can always check our GreenPois0n guide for more information on how to use GreenPois0n to jailbreak your iPhone.
