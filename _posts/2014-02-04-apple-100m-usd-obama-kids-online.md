* All told, commitments from U.S. technology firms total about $750 million as the administration aims to fulfill its self-imposed goal of having 99 percent of students connected to high-speed networks within five years.
* Last summer, only one out of each five American students had high-speed Internet access versus 100 percent of students in places like South Korea.
