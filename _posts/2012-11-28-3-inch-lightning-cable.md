* Have you ever found yourself out and about with a dying iPhone and no charger? With the introduction of Apple’s new Lightning port, that scenario isn’t nearly as unlikely as it used to be.
* That’s why Kickstarters Kegan & Roberto developed the Nomad, a 3-inch USB-to-Lightning cable that fits on your key ring. That way, you’ll never find yourself without an iPhone charger again…
* There’s not much to the Nomad, really. It’s a 3-inch cable that has a Lightning plug on one end, and a USB connector on the other. The USB side plugs into a cap that has a key ring hole.
* The cable is very durable, and flexible enough that it should work with almost any USB port. And the developers say they are committed to using a MFi (made for iPhone)-certified manufacturer.
* At the time of this writing, the Nomad project has raised about $13,000 of its $29,000 goal. They have about 20 days left in the funding round, so if you’re interested, you may want to pledge. All of the lower-cost pledge spots — $5, $10, $15 — are sold out. But you can still score one for as little as $20.
* I’m not out and about enough to worry about my iPhone dying, but I think a lot of folks will find the Nomad useful. It’s just a shame they couldn’t get it to market sooner; it would have made a great Christmas gift.
* What do you think of the Nomad?
