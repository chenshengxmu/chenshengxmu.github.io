* Beginning September 3, T-Mobile customers in the United States will be able to boost their Simple Starter plan via an additional $5 per month option giving them a total of two gigabytes of high-speed 4G LTE data.
* That’s in addition to unlimited talk and text included in the Simple Starter plan, the nation’s fourth largest wireless carrier said Monday morning.
* In other words, in exchange for five bucks on top of your $40 per month Simple Starter charge (for a total of $45 per month), the wireless carrier will quadruple LTE data.
* The new option goes into effect on Wednesday, September 3.
* As a reminder, T-Mobile currently offers the $40 per month contract-free Simple Starter plan with 500MB of LTE data and unlimited talk and text.
* According to a media release, the $5 per month option comes with the usual perks such as no annual service contract and no domestic overages.
* Again, the time-limited promotion kicks off on September 3.
* John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, took a jab at rivals who “punish people” for using more data on their networks with overage charges and fees.
* “Get Verizon’s $50 plan and use just one gig more data, and the price jumps to $65,” he said. “It’s crazy. At T-Mobile, we designed our network data-strong so our customers could use the hell out of it. And that’s just what they’re doing.”
* Last week I announced unli’d 4G LTE data for you and a friend. Today, quadruple data for #simplestarter plans. #wewontstop. Ready for more??

* By the way, the company claims to have a whopping 70 percent more network spectrum per customer than even Verizon.
* Customers who need unlimited data should check out Simple Choice Plans instead.
* Starting at $50 per month, Simple Choice Plans feature unlimited talk, text and data while on T-Mobile’s network for up to five lines, with no data overages.
* For more information, check out T-Mobile’s Simple Starter webpage.
* Last but not least, T-Mobile said its LTE now blankets 233 million Americans.
* They’re also in the process of rolling out Wideband LTE with speeds of up to 110Mpbs (faster than your home broadband) and earlier this year beat rivals to market with the first commercial U.S. deployment of Voice over LTE technology.
* In the meantime, customers of “the old-guard carriers,” as T-Mobile is calling them, will “continue to wait” for VoLTE in their area.
