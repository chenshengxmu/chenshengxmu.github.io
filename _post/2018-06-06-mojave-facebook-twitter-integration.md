* Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites no longer have third-party integration in macOS Mojave. The shift follows a similar move that was enacted with iOS 11 in 2017. With the change, accessing and sharing information with those services on your Mac will require a few more steps.
* As you can see below, the social networks are no longer a choice under Internet Accounts in System Preferences in macOS Mojave, the latest operating system update for Mac that was revealed earlier this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Instead, the choices are limited to iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Mail, CalDAV, CardDAV, LDAP, and Game Center.

* Integration of third-party services such as Vimeo and YouTube was first implemented in OS X Mountain Lion, which arrived in 2012. This version of OS X was the first to include Share Sheets, which made it easier to promote content on your social sites. Now, you’ll have to go to the web or log into a separate app to share information.
* The latest version of macOS, like iOS 12, puts a renewed focus on security, which could be the main reason for this change. Nonetheless, nothing is set in stone. There’s a chance Apple will restore the integration in a future beta of macOS Mojave. That’s probably unlikely, however, given that similar integration was removed from iOS last year.
* Like iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5, macOS Mojave is likely to be released to the public this fall.
* Announced during the WWDC 2018 keynote, macOS Mojave includes an all-new Dark Mode, plus Mac versions of the iOS apps, News, Stocks, Home, and Voice Memos. The update also introduces a refreshed Mac App Store and all-new features like Continuity Camera, Stacks, and more.
