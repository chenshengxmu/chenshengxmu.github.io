* Revered Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has predicted that Apple may begin shipping its second-generation AirPods sometime in the second half of next year.
* In a note to clients issued Tuesday, seen by MacRumors, the analyst wrote that the second-generation AirPods will feature a “smaller quartz component“ without providing specifics.
* Here’s an excerpt from his analyst note:
* Media reports over the past few days on brisk AirPods demand and Apple struggling to keep up with holiday season demand align with our findings and positive predictions on AirPods in several previous reports.
* We forecast the average selling price of radio frequency printed circuit boards for upgraded AirPods in the second half of 2018 may increase, further benefiting business momentum of Unitech and Compeq.
* Components for AirPods should be sourced from suppliers like Unitech, Compeq, TXC and HLJ, with Taiwanese manufacturer Inventec providing assembly services.
* Inventec is currently the sole manufacturer of AirPods. Kuo in an earlier note wrote he expected AirPods shipment to double in 2018 to 26-28 million units.
* Apple has promised to release a standalone inductive AirPods charging case in 2018 that will permit owners of the first-generation earphones to charge them using any Qi wireless charger, including Apple’s own AirPower charging mat coming in 2018, too.
* AirPods are the perfect gift this holiday season, but they unfortunately sold out for Christmas.
