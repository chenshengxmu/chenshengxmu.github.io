* Beats Music, a music-streaming service that uses a combination of algorithms and good ol’ human curation to make it easy to enjoy music based on your location, activities and other criteria, has just been updated with several new features.
* The free iPhone and iPad app, now sitting at version 2.2, has brought out the ability to further tailor music to your tastes by changing your favorite genres and artists.
* And, folks can now view their most recently played songs from The Sentence. Also, avoiding fake profiles is easier than ever because the app now has verified profiles – just look for a new red checkmark indicating a profile has been “certified as legit by Beats”…
* For those wondering, The Sentence is a feature that sets apart Beats Music from the crop of other music-streaming services..
* Put simply, you just tell the app how you’re feeling, what you’re doing and who you’re with and it will play an continuous mix of tracks based on your selections.
* Here’s the full changelog:
* Beats Music, along with Beats Electronics’ headphone business, is in the process of being acquired by Apple for a cool $3 billion.
* Just this morning, the European Commission said ‘yes’ to the transaction, which Apple hopes will close by the end of the September quarter.
* The transaction is still pending regulatory approval in the United States.
* Download Beats Music free in the App Store.
