* Experiencing Wi-Fi problems with your new iPad? Apparently you’re not alone. According to a recent report from 9to5Mac, hundreds of new iPad owners have taken to Apple’s online support forums complaining of the issue.
* In fact, the site has gotten its hands on an internal Apple memo (above) that instructs retail employees to “capture” affected devices — meaning send them in to Apple for inspection — and replace them under warranty…
* The issue seems to only be affecting third-generation Wi-Fi iPads, and includes intermittent connectivity, slow data speeds, and inability to see Wi-Fi networks.
* Here’s one user’s explanation of the bug:
* “I am in a hotel with my laptop and new iPad 3. The laptop Wi-Fi reception is as strong as it gets, but the iPad only registers a weak signal. Anyone else having similar problems? Any suggestions?”
* If you’re experiencing Wi-Fi problems with your new iPad, try taking it in to your local Apple Store. If they determine that the issue isn’t software-related, it sounds like they’ll replace it on the spot.
* Have you been having problems with your new iPad?
