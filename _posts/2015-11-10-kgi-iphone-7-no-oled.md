* Talk of an iPhone equipped with a power-efficient AMOLED screen technology has persisted for years. Yet, Apple continues to build iPhones with LCD screens that use a premium display technology, called IPS (In-Plane Switching), for wide viewing angles and improved image quality.
* According to a note KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent to clients this morning, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, an ‘iPhone 7’ won’t be adopting AMOLED screens for iPhones for the next three years.
* According to Kuo, Apple will continue to use the existing LTPS TFT-LCD display technology for at least the next three years, meaning an AMOLED iPhone might eventually come in 2019.
* In his note, the analyst argues that Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, has just struck a deal with the government of Henan Province in China to build a sixth-generation LTPS TFT-LCD production lines in Zhengzhou.
* “The plant will enter mass production in 2018, and Kuo is ‘confident’ that the huge investment is for earning TFT-LCD orders for future iPhones,” writes AppleInsider.
* Some of the typical benefits of AMOLED technology include lower power consumption because only the pixels in use are being lit up and no power-hungry backlight is needed.
* Others include deeper blacks and more vivid colors.
* The major downside to using AMOLED or OLED technology over the traditional LCD panels: somewhat oversaturated colors.
* The only Apple mobile product that currently employs OLED screens: the Apple Watch.
