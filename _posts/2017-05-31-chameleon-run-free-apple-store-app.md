* Chameleon Run, the popular auto runner by developer Noodlecake Studios, is now available at no charge for the next two weeks but only through the official Apple Store app.
* On App Store, the game currently sells for $0.99.
* If you haven’t had a chance to grab Chameleon Run back in February when Apple featured it on App Store as part of its weekly Free App of the Week promotion, download the official Apple Store app now to claim your free copy of this awesome platformer with a colorful twist.
* This promotion will expire on June 15, 2017.
* Featuring smooth execution, this fast-paced auto runner requires you to switch your character’s color to match the ground as you run and jump from platform to platform.
* The game’s expertly crafted levels “will have you running back for more”.
* Chameleon Run features pixel-perfect physics, simple two-button controls, fun jumping mechanics with special moves (i.e. “double jump”, “head jump” and so forth), non-linear levels with three special objectives in each one and other perks.
* It plays especially well on the fourth-generation Apple TV.
* To claim your free copy of Chameleon Run, first download the official Apple Store app.
* Next, launch the Apple Store app and tap the Discover tab at the bottom. Scroll halfway down until you spot the Chameleon Run offer, then tap “Download now for free”.
* You should see an overlay offering basic information about the game.

* You’ll be asked if you’d like to finish redeeming your gift in App Store. Hit Continue to bring up the game’s App Store page, then hit Redeem to claim your free copy of Chameleon Run. Once you’ve successfully redeemed the promo code, hit Done.
* The game should begin downloading to your device. Chameleon Run supports iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. As always, you can use the App Store’s Purchased section to re-download the game to your Apple TV and other iOS devices using the same Apple ID.
