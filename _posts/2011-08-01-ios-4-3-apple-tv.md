* Apple has just released iOS 4.3 for the Apple TV, which adds a slew of new features to the device.
* Although there still seems to be no changelog yet, John Gruber noted in multiple tweets new features in the update, such as the ability to now buy (you could only rent beforehand) TV shows directly from your Apple TV, as well as stream any previous TV shows you’ve purchased. It also adds support for Vimeo…
* The update is only available on the new Apple TV, and, according to a few tweets, is only available in the United States (for now), which could explain why Apple hasn’t made the release officially public.
* We’ll let you know as soon as we see the Apple TV update show up in other countries.
* In the meanwhile, you download iOS 4.3 for Apple TV from our download section.
