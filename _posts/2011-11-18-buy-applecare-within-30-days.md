* Apple introduced AppleCare+ alongside the release of the iPhone 4S, and there’s been plenty of confusion surrounding the new warranty plan since then. Instead of the typical AppleCare plan that has been in place for years, AppleCare+ offers extended coverage to new iPhone customers with new requirements.
* If you bought an iPhone 4S on launch day, you’re unable to buy AppleCare+ now. If you plan on purchasing the iPhone 4S, or didn’t buy it on launch day, you have a 30-day window to purchase the plan before you’re left out in the unprotected cold.
* Apple requires you to buy AppleCare+ with your new iPhone for some odd reason, but you now have 30 days to make the $99 decision after you buy your new iPhone.
* You can learn more about AppleCare+ on Apple’s website. The plan allows for two accidental damage repairs with a $49 service fee. Your iPhone is covered by AppleCare+ for two years.
* Every iPhone comes with one year of hardware repair coverage and 90 days of telephone technical support. AppleCare+ for iPhone extends repair coverage and technical support to two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone and adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage due to handling, each subject to a $49 service fee.1 With AppleCare+ for iPhone, Apple experts can help troubleshoot issues over the phone or at an Apple Retail Store. They’ll answer questions about iOS, Apple iPhone apps such as Mail, iMessage, and Calendar, and help you solve interconnectivity issues between your iPhone and Mac or PC. And if your iPhone needs service under the plan, Apple technical support representatives can even set up a repair during the same call.
* SprintFeed is reporting that early iPhone customers on Sprint have until December 15th to buy AppleCare+, but Apple’s policy seems to conflict with this claim.
* If you’re prone to dropping your iPhone, AppleCare+ is probably something you want to consider. It’s always good to have the peace of mind that a new iPhone is only $50 away, should disaster strike.
