* Up until now, if you wanted to change the default font on your iPhone, your only option was to use FontSwap, which unfortunately wasn’t updated to work on iOS 4. Another alternative was to manually change the iPhone font via SSH, but that wasn’t very straightforward.
* Enters BytaFont, a new jailbreak application that allows you to easily change the font on your iPhone, system wide…
* Changing the font on your iPhone with BytaFont is pretty quick and simple. First you need to install BytaFont from Cydia. Once this is done, go to Cydia > Sections > Fonts, and install any fonts from there.
* Then go back to your iPhone springboard and launch BytaFont. You will see your downloaded font in there, as well as the original iOS 4 font (which comes preloaded with BytaFont). Select the font you want to install and confirm. Your device will respring and you should see the new font all over your iPhone.
* As you can see on the image above, I used BytaFont with the DroidSans font. There are many other fonts available so you may want to dig in Cydia to find the right one for you.
* Have you use BytaFont? If so, what font are you using?
