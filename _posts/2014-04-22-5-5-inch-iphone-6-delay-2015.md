* The next iPhone, if swirling rumors are anything to go by – will come in two flavors. A smaller model with a 4.7-inch screen optimized for one-handed use and a larger-screened device incorporating a phablet-class display measuring 5.5 inches diagonally.
* Corroborating earlier reports that the 5.5-inch model could be pushed back to 2015, a Taiwanese outlet is now claiming that the device is indeed facing a delay over production issues pertained to its supposedly very thin battery components…
* According to the latest scuttlebutt from Taiwanese news site The Commercial Times [Google translate, via GforGames], Apple’s engineers in their pursue of “a very thin device” have faced roadblocks as its battery cell suppliers are finding it difficult to meet Cupertino’s demands.
* Specifically, Apple has apparently commissioned its battery suppliers – which include LG Chemical and Samsung – to produce components measuring 2mm or less.
* Technical requirements are said to have posed challenges as standard smartphone batteries have a thickness of roughly 2.8 – 2.9 millimeters.
* The 4.7-inch model is on track to launch in September, according to the outlet.
* As such, reports claim that the 5.5-inch iPhone 6′s release date will be delayed to 2015, or, in other words: until Apple’s suppliers will be able to meet these technical requirements and output a decent yield.
* The story mentions that the device is internally referred to as the iPhone Air.
* We’d find such a name to be highly improbable were it not for the iPad Air, which debuted last Fall with the new moniker, much to the surprise of watchers and fans.

* Both Apple and its suppliers internally refer to the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 as the iPhone Air. The report goes on to caution that the moniker “is not set in stone,” leaving open the possibility that the device might go on sale under a different name.
* Here’s a not-so-probable iPhone 6 Pro concept.
* I guess the authors of this thingy haven’t heard a Steve Jobs quote which goes something like “if you see a stylus, they blew it.”
* Would you immediately pick up a 4.7-inch iPhone as soon as it became available or wait out until an iPhablet came along?
