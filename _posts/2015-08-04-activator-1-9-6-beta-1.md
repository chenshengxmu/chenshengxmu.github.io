* A new beta version of Activator is now available for download. The often-updated staple jailbreak tweak from developer Ryan Petrich brings several new features and fixes to the table.
* Check out this post to learn what the update contains and how to install the updated version on your jailbroken device.
* Activator 1.9.6 beta 1 change log:

* System power down view action:

* The system power down view action can be assigned to a gesture to immediately access the power down slider. This lets you bypass the delay that normally occurs when holding down the sleep button.
* Launch playing app action:

* This launches the app that’s currently playing audio.
* The naming of custom events has been rebranded as Build, which is makes sense, seeing as you’re creating new actions from scratch.
