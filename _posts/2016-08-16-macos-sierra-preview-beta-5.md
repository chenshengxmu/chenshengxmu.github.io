* As you know, Apple yesterday seeded a sixth beta of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra to its registered developers and public beta testers along with developer-only builds of watchOS 3 and tvOS 10.
* As we’re now weeks away from their tentative fall release, small wonder the latest betas lack new outward-facing features. Here’s Andrew’s hands-on video detailing changes in the latest betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra and watchOS 3.
* In iOS 10 beta 6, search hints now function as expected in Messages.
* Siri will now provide appropriate response when the request requires a removed app. Apple also fixed three issues in SiriKit and fixed an issue preventing an iMessage app extension to stop responding or be blank when launched from the iOS Simulator.
* watchOS 3 beta 6 allows the debugger to automatically attach when running in Xcode and your watch will no longer intermittently disconnect. As for macOS Sierra beta 6, that release came with minor bug fixes.
* Now watch iDownloadBlog’s Andrew O’Hara explaining what’s new in the latest betas.
* If you don’t see the embedded clip, watch it on YouTube.

* tvOS 10 beta 6 is not included in the video because it contains no changes versus the previous beta aside from an UIKit fix allowing an already presented system keyboard to correctly respond to system appearance changes between Light and Dark modes.
* By the way, tvOS developers can easily switch between Light and Dark appearance in the iOS Simulator by using the Shift (⇧)—Command (⌘)—D keyboard shortcut.
* Before signing off, let me briefly mention changes in the previous beta of macOS Sierra (beta 5): rented movies now show artwork in iTunes, Microsoft’s OneDrive app can store credentials in Keychain, iCloud Preferences which used to appear during Setup Assistant has been removed and Sierra can now automatically discover Apple Pay-capable iPhone or Apple Watch to complete payment.
* If you use iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 or tvOS 10 betas on your devices and have discovered other changes in their sixth beta, post them in comments or email us at tips@iDownloadBlog.com and we’ll update.
