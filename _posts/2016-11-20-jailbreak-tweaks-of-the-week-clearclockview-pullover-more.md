* As we continue to go on without a public jailbreak for iOS 10, the Cydia store is in the middle of a drought. These trends are typical when we don’t see a new jailbreak for a long period of time, but Apple isn’t making things any easier with their rapid software updates.
* Regardless, jailbreak developers haven’t given up just yet. In this roundup, we’ll talk about what’s new in Cydia as of this week.

* PullOver is a tweak that lets you pin any app to a configurable slider interface that you can bring up or dismiss on demand with Activator.
* Its purpose is to try and make multitasking easier under certain circumstances, and based on how it’s used, I think that’s exactly what it’s going to do for you.
* When you open PullOver, the app you’ve assigned to it is going to launch in a windowed view and let you access its data until you dismiss the app. Once you do, you’re returned to the interface you were in previously.
* You can read our full review of PullOver to learn more about how it works and what you can do to configure it to your liking.
* ClearClockView: Makes the Clock app icon clear (free)
* Sure, the list wasn’t very long this week, but that’s to be expected in jailbreak tweak lulls like these. With a stroke of luck, perhaps next week will be better.
* On the other hand, last week was much more eventful. If you want to double-check to see if you’ve missed anything, we recommend checking out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup.
