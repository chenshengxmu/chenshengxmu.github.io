* Nintendo’s highly-anticipated Super Mario Run launched on the App Store Thursday afternoon as a free download with a non-compulsory $9.99 In-App Purchase to unlock all of the gameplay modes and levels. If you’re as excited for this game as I am (amazing what nostalgia can do, eh?), you’ll be collecting those coins like there’s no tomorrow.
* In order to prevent unwanted battery drains, we have some tips for you about minimizing energy consumption while playing Super Mario Run on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* Within the game’s options menu, there are settings for rendering and graphics that you can dial down in order to make Super Mario Run easier on the battery.
* 1) Launch Super Mario Run on your device.
* 2) Tap to begin.
* 3) Tap the Menu button in the lower left corner.
* 4) Tap Settings.
* 5) Tap Options.

* 7) Tap “X” to return to the options menu, then tap “X” again to return to the game.
* Changing graphics and rendering settings to Low puts the game in power-saving mode.
* “The display smoothness and detail on the screen will be reduced, but the amount of energy used will also be reduced,” reads the in-game prompt.
* Unlike some other iOS apps and games, Super Mario Run unfortunately does not automatically decrease graphics and rendering quality on your behalf when you activate low-power mode in Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode.
* Super Mario Run doesn’t work on jailbroken devices, but we have a tutorial on bypassing jailbreak protection in the game for those of you who are jailbroken.
* Super Mario Run is free to download from the App Store.
