* Publisher 2K Games and developer Firaxis Games are gearing up to launch a new interstellar strategy game for Mac and Windows PCs and the iPad, Polygon said Monday.
* Coming in early 2015, legendary game designer Sid Meier had a direct hand in designing Sid Meier’s Starships, a turn-based, adventure-driven interstellar strategy game in which you’ll take the role of a fleet commander after the age of the Seeding.
* The player is tasked with building a planetary federation and leading their starships across the universe to defend planets against various enemies. You’re expected to grow your empire along the way and “usher in a new age of peace in the galaxy,” Firaxis said in a media release today.
* The cinematic intro sequence looks exciting!
* Starships will tie in with the Civilization: Beyond Earth universe as Firaxis is building cross-connectivity between the two titles to enhance the experience for those who own Beyond Earth and also buy Starships.
* In addition to turn-based 4X combat, the game sports customizable starships, dynamically generated combat missions, future technologies to research and explore, a universe filled with interstellar adventure, diplomacy and exploration and much more.

* Starships has been designed as a spiritual successor to Civilization: Beyond Earth, which released on Mac and Windows PCs in October 2014.
* “When designing Starships, I was intrigued by the idea of exploring the next chapter in the story of Civilization: Beyond Earth,” said Meier.

* “What happens after we colonize our new home and eventually build starships to take to the stars?” he continued. “What has become of our long-lost brothers and sisters from the planet Earth?”
* Starships will release in Spring 2015, 2K said.
* Keep your eyes peeled as we post more details as soon as they’re released.
