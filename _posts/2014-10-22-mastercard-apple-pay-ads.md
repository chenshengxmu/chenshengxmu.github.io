* MasterCard, one of Apple’s launch partners for Apple Pay, has begun airing new television commercials during last night’s Game 1 highlighting Apple’s mobile payments service, which became available at more than 220,000 locations in the United States with the release of iOS 8.1 this Monday.
* “Fans who use their MasterCard with Apple Pay are enjoying priceless surprises, even at the World Series,” the voiceover can be heard saying. And what exactly might those “priceless surprises” be?
* How about tickets to the games and even “meeting a baseball legend” such as George Brett and other “once in a lifetime experiences”?
* Jump past the fold to watch the ads now.
* The commercials feature such names as former Yankees star Mariano Rivera, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda and Kansas City Royals’s George Brett.
* This is actually a pretty big deal and awesome news for Apple Pay.
* Major League Baseball’s World Series just kicked off and MasterCard is an official MLB partner so you can bet that these commercials will be running everywhere.

* More importantly, Apple Pay payments are now accepted at both Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City and AT&T Park in San Francisco so these ads will hopefully translate into Apple Pay purchase volume.
* The card company is actually first out of the gate to spotlight Apple Pay in television commercials. Strangely enough, Apple has not yet started promoting the service via TV ads of its own.
* Are these ads priceless or what?
