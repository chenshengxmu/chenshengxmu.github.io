* Apple has officially released iTunes 10.5.1 to the public following several developer betas. iTunes Match has been in the final testing stages for months, and beta 3 of the cloud music service was seeded to developers over the weekend.
* Alongside iTunes 10.5.1, Apple is finally releasing iTunes Match to the US public today after a two week delay. It’s finally here…
* The new iTunes is also available on Apple’s website, and the 10.5.1 is propagating in Software Update for Mac and Windows users. iTunes 10.5.1 is required to use iTunes Match, and iOS 5 users will be able to access their tracks in the cloud once the service is enabled in iTunes.

* Neither iTunes 10.5.1 nor iTunes Match seem to be available for everyone yet, as Apple is still rolling things out. If you can’t get the new iTunes in Software Update, we recommend downloading it directly from Apple’s website.
* iTunes Match is still a US-only service.
