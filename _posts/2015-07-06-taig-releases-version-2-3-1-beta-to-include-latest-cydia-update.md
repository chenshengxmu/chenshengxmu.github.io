* In an interesting move, the folks over at TaiG have released a new version of their iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool for Windows, but have labeled it as a beta. Version 2.3.1 beta incorporates the latest version of Cydia, version 1.1.20, and that’s about all.
* According to the change log, no other changes were implemented into the TaiG tool outside of the Cydia update. For such a small change, it’s weird that they’ve labeled it as being a beta, but maybe this will become a new trend going forward until they have enough successful testers to deem it a stable release.
* TaiG isn’t recommending that users use the beta version, and instead are pointing the public to its most recent public version of the jailbreak tool—version 2.3.0.
* Here is what TaiG is saying about the beta tool:
* 1. V2.3.1 integrates the latest Cydia 1.1.20.
* 2. V2.3.1 is a beta version. If not necessary, you can use the previous version to jailbreak.
* 3. If any problem, please contact us: @TaiG_Jailbreak.
* Indeed, it looks as if they’re soliciting feedback from those who use the tool.
* Here is the change log for TaiG 2.3.1 beta:
* You can download TaiG 2.3.1 beta from our downloads page.
* Does this mean that we’ll begin seeing future TaiG releases, even major one for new firmware builds, come out as beta releases initially? That’s yet to be seen, but with this latest revelation, it’s not out of the realm of possibilities.
* What do you think?
