* Apple has begun offering a global battery replacement service aimed at owners of eligible non-Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro notebook models.
* A limited number of 13-inch MacBook Pros without Touch Bar, manufactured between October 2016 and October 2017, utilize a component that may fail and cause the notebook’s built-in battery to expand unexpectedly. Apple will replace eligible batteries free of charge.
* This global initiative does not extend the standard warranty coverage of your laptop, but it does cover affected MacBook Pro models for 5 years after the first retail sale of the unit.
* If already paid to have the battery in your affected machine replaced, contact Apple about a refund.
* Eligibility is determined by the product serial number. To see if your notebook is eligible for this battery replacement service, visit the Apple website and submit the serial number.
* If the serial number checker has determined that your notebook has an eligible serial number meaning it qualifies for the program, Apple will replace the battery free of charge. Service may take 3-5 days barring any unforeseen circumstances. It’s worth bearing in mind that Apple technicians will examine your computer to verify that it’s in fact in working order.
* “If your 13-inch MacBook Pro has any damage which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement,” Apple said. “In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair.”
