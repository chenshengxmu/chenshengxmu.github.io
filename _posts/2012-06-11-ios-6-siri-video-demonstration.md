title: iOS 6- Siri video demonstration
---
* Here is our first video demonstration showcasing some of the new Siri features included in iOS 6. As we previously reported, new features include sports scores, Movie info, including showtimes, trailers, reviews, and actor information, the ability to launch apps, and much more.
* The new Siri is also iPad compatible, and we provide you with a sneak peak of the virtual assistant running on the iPad near the tail end of the video as well. Be sure to let us know what you think about Siriâ€™s new and improved features and iPad compatibility in the comments below.
