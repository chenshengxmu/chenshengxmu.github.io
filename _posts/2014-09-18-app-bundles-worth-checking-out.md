* Alongside iOS 8, the App Store received a number of improvements, including video previews and support for app bundles. And with yesterday’s release, several app bundles popped up in Apple’s digital storefront, so we’ve decided to roundup a few worth checking out.
* To give you an idea of how this works, among our list is the Runtastic Cardio Pack, which includes 5 iPhone apps made by runtastic that are meant to track various fitness activities. Individually, these apps would cost you $16, but the bundle is just $8—a 50% savings.
* Note that if you already have an app included in a bundle, Apple offers the option to ‘Complete Your Bundle’ for a cheaper price like it does with other iTunes content. Also note that there are other bundles available, and you do not have to be on iOS 8 to purchase them.
