* We’ve seen our fair share of reactions to Steve Jobs’ death since the news broke on Wednesday. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak’s video interview was probably the most moving of them all.
* Yesterday, it was Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart’s turn to pay respect to Jobs in their own way. Funny and touching at the same time…
* We’ll miss you, Steve.
* PS: Sorry to our international readers, but these videos are viewable only in the US. This is not our fault, it’s Hulu’s. We looked for other videos but couldn’t find them.
