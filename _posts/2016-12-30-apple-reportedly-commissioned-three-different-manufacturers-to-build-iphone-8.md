* Hedging its bets, Apple has apparently commissioned a third contract manufacturer to build iPhone 8 alongside established suppliers and longtime partners Foxconn and Pegatron. According to a Chinese-language report in the Economic Daily News newspaper, quoted by Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, Apple supplier Wistron will get to build some of the future iPhone units.

* Wistron announced recently that it will boost investment at its subsidiary in Kunshan from the previous budget $135 million to $200 million. The Kunshan plant is responsible for the production of mobile devices for Wistron clients.
* Wistron will reportedly utilize its expertise gained from its previous production of iPhone 5c and iPhone SE for the manufacture of a future, undisclosed iPhone model. The company has declined to comment on the report.
* In addition to iPhone 5c and iPhone SE, Wistron is thought to be building Apple’s Touch Bar component in the new MacBook Pro.
