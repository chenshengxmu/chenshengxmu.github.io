* Team 17, a British video game developer behind the Worms series of games, has slashed all Worms games on the App Store to just 99 cents in celebration of the series’ 19th anniversary.
* Older readers will remember Worms as one of the best games for the Amiga personal computer in 1995. Team17 continued development of the various Worms games with Worms: The Director’s Cut which arrived in 1997 with improved gameplay and graphics. The series has since made a jump to consoles and PCs.
* Featuring cartoonish pixel art graphics, smooth multi-layered scrolling and an interesting mix of turn-based gameplay, humor and hilarious weaponry, the franchise has gone on to be very successful, selling over twelve million units worldwide to this date.
* The following titles have been discounted to 99 cents a pop.
* Again, each of the titles above sells for $4.99 a piece so you’re looking at a cool saving of nearly 24 bucks if you pick up all of the titles in the series.
* That’s a pretty good deal in my book.
* There’s no word how long the sale will last. Team17’s other App Store games include Hay Ewe, (R)evolve, Superfrog HD, Alien Breed and more.
* On the Mac side, Team17 has you covered with Superfrog, Worms Crazy Golf, Worms 3, Worms Revolution — Deluxe Edition and Worms Special Edition, all available in the Mac App Store.
* Here’s the official Worms 3 trailer.
* The Worms game concept was originally created by game designer Andy Davidson. Borrowing cues from turn-based artillery games that were popular at the time, the series puts you in control of a small platoon of worms across a deformable landscape.
* The player gets to control their colorful characters individually, each carrying some bizarre projectile weapons, in an effort to get rid of their opponent’s worms army. A compelling multiplayer mode with entertaining campaign mode rounds out such a well-thought and fun strategy game.
