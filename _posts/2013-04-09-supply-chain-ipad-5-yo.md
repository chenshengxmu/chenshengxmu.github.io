* As we move into mid-April, the odds of seeing Apple unveil a new product this spring continue to dwindle. It feels like we’re getting close enough to its June developer conference, that any major announcements could wait until then.
* There is, however, still a rumor floating around that Apple has plans for an iPad event later this month. But according to a new supply chain report, that’s not going to happen, as 5th gen iPads won’t go into production until the summer…
* Citing sources within Taiwan-based suppliers, DigiTimes reports:
* “Volume production of the fifth-generation 9.7-inch iPad will kick off in July-August 2013, according to sources with Taiwan-based supply chain makers. Yield rates for key components, especially touch panels, will be a major concern for smooth production.”
* The report goes on to say that the sources described the new iPad as thinner and lighter than Apple’s fourth-generation tablet, and say it will adopt an iPad mini-like slim bezel design—something we’ve heard from a number of outlets.
* It also mentions that the 5th gen iPad’s display is expected to be supplied by LG Display and Sharp. It’s believed that Apple will have to go with IGZO panels, or a similar tech, this time around, in order to help slim down the bulky tablet.
* It’s interesting because a July-August production ramp-up would mean Apple probably wouldn’t announce the new iPad at WWDC. So not only would it have missed the April-May buying season—when schools order supplies for the following school year—but it would also miss a large portion of the back-to-school shopping season.
* Can Apple really ride out its current tablet offerings until late summer or early fall? What do you think?
