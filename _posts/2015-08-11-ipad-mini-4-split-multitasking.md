* The upcoming iPad mini 4 will likely be powerful enough to support the Split View multitasking feature in iOS 9. 9to5Mac points to a resource file discovered by developer Hamza Sood in OS X El Capitan that depicts an iPad mini with two apps running side-by-side.
* Additionally, a tool in El Capitan allows developers to simulate an iPad mini 3 running Safari in Split View mode, even though the device does not currently support the feature. Combined, this evidence suggests that Apple is preparing to launch a powerful 8-inch tablet.
* As of now, the only device that supports iOS 9’s Split View feature is the iPad Air 2, which features a robust A8X processor and 2GB of RAM. So you’d think that the internal hardware of the fourth-genernation iPad mini would have to either meet or exceed these specs.
* We’ve heard few details about the internals of the iPad mini 4 thus far, but there has been some reports regarding its external design. According to recently-leaked CAD drawings, the tablet has been slimmed down to just 6.1mm thick and looks a lot like the larger Air.
* Apple is expected to announce the new iPad mini, alongside a new Air and possibly the long-rumored 12.9-inch iPad Pro, at a press event on Wednesday, September 9.
