* Well, here’s something we didn’t expect. Apple has just seeded a second beta of iOS 5.0.1 to developers. It’s hard to recall a time when the Cupertino company released a beta version of any incremental iOS update, but a second is almost unheard of.
* The first iteration of iOS 5.0.1 was released just two days ago. The update brought about all kinds of maintenance, including patches for the infamous battery bug and the Smart Cover issue. We haven’t noticed any changes in beta 2 as of yet…
* But if you have an Apple developer account, you can head over to the Dev Center and download it. We’ve actually been having trouble getting the full version of the software, so if you’re having issues you may want to try the over-the-air option.
* Remember, to download updates OTA, just open the Settings app, tap General, and then Software Update. If you are jailbroken or are not registered as a developer, you won’t be able to access it. We’ll let you know if we find any notable changes.
