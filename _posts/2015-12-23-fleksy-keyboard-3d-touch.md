* Fleksy, the popular software keyboard for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, was updated earlier this week with a bunch of refinements and new features, including 3D Touch-based cursor control and Home screen shortcuts on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* Other goodies in Fleksy 7.5 include the all-new (and free) festive pack to dress up your keyboard in holiday-themed skins, the ability to search for emoji with the Highlights extension, a new GIF & Stickers tab for browsing animated GIFs and more.
* Pressing Fleksy’s Home screen icon lightly brings up a contextual menu with the following shortcuts: Help & Feedback, Settings and GIFs & Sticker.
* And if using Fleksy on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you can press firmly any key to turn the keyboard into a trackpad-like surface for precise cursor positioning, much like Apple’s implementation of 3D Touch cursor control on the stock keyboard.

* On non-iPhone 6s devices, this feature can still be activated by long-pressing the Spacebar. The Cursor Control extension must be activated within Fleksy’s settings before 3D Touch can be used. To do so, launch Fleksy’s helper app, tap the Extensions tab and then hit the Cursor Control tile to activate the extension.
