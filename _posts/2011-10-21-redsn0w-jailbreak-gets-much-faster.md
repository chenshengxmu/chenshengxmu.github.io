title: RedSn0w Jailbreak Gets Much Faster
---
* One of the biggest complains people have about RedSn0w is how long it takes to go through the jailbreaking process. This is due to the fact that RedSn0w spends a lot of time “stashing” applications on your device.

* Due to the demand for a faster tool, the Dev Team announced today that they have made the RedSn0w jailbreak process 60% faster by releasing version 0.9.9 beta 7. But it’s not without a caveat…
* “After some feedback on reddit, we’ve decided to make the initial jailbreak as quick as possible by no longer “stashing” the applications by default during the redsn0w run. This reduces the time to actually perform the jailbreak from 210 seconds to 80 seconds (60 percent!). However, you make up for much of that the first time you launch Cydia, which will then want to stash the applications. You can choose whether you want redsn0w or Cydia to stash in the Preferences pane.”
* In short, the time you gain with the faster RedSn0w will eventually be lost the first time you launch Cydia, because it will have to go through the applications stashing process. In the end, it’s all the same.
* Now it’s up to you to decide when you want to spend this time stashing applications. Now, or later? You can choose what you want to do in the Preferences pane.
* As usual, you can download RedSn0w from our download section. You can also learn how to use RedSn0w on our dedicated page.
* Have you tried RedSn0w 0.9.9 beta 7 yet? If so, what option did you choose, and why?
