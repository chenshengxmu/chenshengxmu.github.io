* Former Apple executive Chris Lattner is leaving Tesla. He barely lasted six months on the job. “Chris just wasn’t the right fit for Tesla, and we’ve decided to make a change,” the electric car company said Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal.
* He exited the same day Tesla hired leading artificial intelligence expert Andrej Karpathy as its new director of AI and Autopilot. Lattner’s LinkedIn profile had not been updated at post time to reflect his exit from Elon Musk’s company.
* He did tweet though that he was interested in any available roles for a seasoned engineering leader. “Turns out that Tesla isn’t a good fit for me after all,” reads his impromptu tweet. “I’m interested to hear about interesting roles for a seasoned engineering leader”.
* The Wall Street Journal notes that Tesla saw a number of high-profile departures over the past few months amid pressure from CEO Elon Musk on engineers to develop and perfect autonomous car systems by the end of 2017, a tall order.
* Credited as the creator of Swift, Apple’s new modern pogromming language, Lattner left Apple this January to take a position as Vice President of Autopilot Software at Tesla. During his Apple tenure, he also held the title of Senior Director of the Developer Tools team.
