* An iOS vulnerability that permitted nefarious people to gain access to Contacts and Photos data has been fixed swiftly without the need for a software update. A server-side fix has patched a security hole in Siri which allowed the personal digital assistant to use email links in tweets to gain access to contacts and photos on a locked iPhone 6s running iOS 9.3.1. Apple has confirmed to The Washington Post that it’s fixed the flaw on its servers.
* Jose Rodriguez, who first detailed the flaw, is now demanding on Twitter that Apple launch a bounty program similar to other companies that would reward well-intentioned hackers who would discover critical flaws in iOS and OS X with cash.
* I just found a new Passcode Bypass Photos and Contacts iPhone 6S + iOS 9.3 Waiting for Apple bug bounty program It is true, I'm not bluffing

* The Siri flaw was limited to devices with 3D Touch—the latest-generation iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus—set up so that Siri can be invoked on the Lock screen and has access to your Twitter account and Photos library.
