title: Australia is the Latest Victim of Apple's iPhone Shortage Game
---
* On launch day of the iPhone 4 I was 26th in line at the Mall of America. I arrived at 2 in the morning and by the time Apple opened their doors there were easily over 300 people waiting behind me. I know that everyone in line that day didn’t go home with the new iPhone. It was blissfully maddening.

* The latest shortage reports are coming out of Australia where TUAW shows the country’s carriers are feeling the heat from a high demand, low supply market. With cell carriers down under getting new shipments each week, and the Apple stores in the US each day, I feel like the company purposely shorthands their retailers and inadvertently causes chaos…
* I know that it wouldn’t be the first time a company has set a limit on the amount of products to be released on launch day but this isn’t just any company. It’s freaking Apple. I say that Apple should know by now the anticipation of the iPhone 4 after the launch days the product has endured thus far. Australia should have had no problem meeting demand.
* Allowing users and carrier outlets to suffer at the hands of their hype is irresponsible. I say if they can ship the product each day or week then they should be able to offer more up front. Why does it seem so simple?
* Do you think Apple is still purposely releasing only so many iPhone 4 per launch date, and if so should they stop? Give us your opinions in the fully stocked comment box.
