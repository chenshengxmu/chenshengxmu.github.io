* Wish List is one of the lesser-known features of App Store. Your Wish List is accessible in App Store on mobile and iTunes on desktop. As the feature’s title suggests, you can add iPhone, iPad and iPod touch apps and games to your Wish List that you might want to explore or purchase later.
* With this tutorial, you’ll learn how to add, remove and downloads items on your Wish List on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC devices.

* Wish List syncs across your devices. Changes made to the items on your Wish List on one device are reflected on other devices signed in to the same App Store account, and vice versa.

* Aside from Wish List acting as a bookmarking feature for apps, iTunes Store has its own Wish List that supports other purchasable media. For example, you could keep stuff like movies, TV shows, books and other paid items on your iTunes Store Wish List to keep an eye on or perhaps buy later.
* Wish List on iTunes Store supports music, movies, TV shows and more.

* Wish List on iTunes Store also keeps a history of the songs you’ve previewed, listened to on Apple Music Radio or asked Siri to identify.
* Wish List on iTunes Store is divided into three sections:
* Wish List is also supported in the Movies app on Apple TV but it sync only with other Apple TVs.
* Wish List on Apple TV is only supported in the Movies app.

* As mentioned, Wish List is not supported in Mac App Store.
* Books added to your Wish Lists appear only in iTunes on desktop, not in your iTunes Store Wish List on iOS devices. We’re not sure why Apple doesn’t allow this considering books are part of iTunes Store.
* Do you use Wish Lists at all?
* If so, what do you use it for beyond keeping track of the items you’d like to buy at a later stage? Have you ever used Wish List to find a song Siri has identified? If you’ve never used Wish List before, we’d like you to give it a try because it’s one of those little features you don’t know you need until you’ve used it.
