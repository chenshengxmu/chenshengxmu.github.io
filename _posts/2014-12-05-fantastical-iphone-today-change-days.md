* Flexibits’ calendar and reminders application, Fantastical, has received a small update today in both iPhone and iPad edition which has brought out an enhanced search feature and the ability to change days in its Today widget on iOS 8.
* Moreover, the team has fixed an issue when snoozing Exchange alerts and you’ll also notice that the app now handles latitude and longitude coordinates for event locations better than before.
* The search feature is now even smarter than before so instead of typing “birthday” you can just enter “bday” and Fantastical will find a matching entry based on these partial fragments.
* To enable Fantastical’s today widget, hit the gear icon in the app’s upper-left corner and choose Today Widget. Here you can selectively enable or disable “Calendar” as well as “Events & Reminders” options that will then show up in the Notification Center.

* To add the widget, swipe down from the top of the screen of your iOS device to view Notification Center, scroll to the bottom of the Today view, tap Edit, hit the plus sign next to ”Fantastical” and tap Done.
* Fantastical 2.2.2 changelog:
* Originally added nearly two months ago, Fantastical’s widget allows you to view your calendar and event list in iOS 8’s Notification Center.
* Fully optimized for iOS 8, Fantastical also supports Interactive Notifications allowing you to quickly snooze an alert or complete a reminder from the notification and has a Share sheet extension for quickly creating events or reminders from selected text in other apps that implement iOS 8’s multi-purpose Share menu.
* This update is free to existing users.
* Grab Fantastical 2 for iPhone for $4.99.
* The iPad edition will set you back $9.99.
