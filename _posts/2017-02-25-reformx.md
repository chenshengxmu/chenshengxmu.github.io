* A number of large springboard customization jailbreak tweaks are paid, and expensive at that, but for those who want a budget option, a new free jailbreak tweak called ReformX by zEstLabs could be just the one you’ve been waiting for.
* This tweak provides you all kinds of options for tricking out your Home screen, ranging from the layout of your Home screen icons, to the style of your dock, to the appearance of your folders; the list goes on.
* ReformX isn’t quite as feature-heavy as tweaks like Springtomize, but it still offers a wide range of options to make your Home screen look different from everyone else’s. You will be able to change the number of apps in each column/row on the Home screen and configure custom icon sizes, among other things.
* After you install the tweak, a new app icon will make its way to your Home screen that has all of the tweak’s configuration options. All of the configuration options are divided into groups to make finding them easier:

* Among the different preference groups are Dock, Folders, Home screen, Miscellaneous, and Rotation, but you’ll also find a cell for saved presets, which allows you to save any group of settings you make for use again at a later date. Without further ado, we’ll show you what each of the settings cells have to offer below:
* Dock

* In the first cell, entitled Dock, you will get all of the following options to customize your dock:
* Folders

* Another cell, entitled Homescreen, lets you change around your general Home screen icons. You get all of these settings:
* Miscellaneous

* From the cell entitled Misc, you will get all of the following options:
* Rotation

* In the cell entitled Rotation, there are several more settings you can change around, including:
* Apart from all of these cells, which give you the ability to make some really unique Home screens, you also have that Preset cell, which gives you the power to save all of the settings you’ve made into a new preset or to apply a previously-made preset with just a tap:

* The preset feature is particularly useful if you’re into theming and like to have certain settings applied to one theme, while having a totally different set of options applied to another. This way, when you switch between themes, you can also switch presets and your settings will take effect immediately without having to re-configure the tweak all over again.
* Overall, ReformX offers some pretty good value for a freebie; after all, many tweaks that offer this number of options are usually paid, so the developer is really giving the jailbreak community a treat with this one.
* If you’re interested in trying ReformX out, you will need a jailbroken iOS 10 device. If you have that, you can head right over to Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now to grab the tweak free of cost.
