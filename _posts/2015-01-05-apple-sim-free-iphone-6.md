* Apple will begin selling fully unlocked, SIM-free iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models in the United States this week, according to a new report from 9to5Mac. Citing sources familiar with the launch, the site’s Mark Gurman says that the unlocked iPhones will be available starting January 6th via Apple’s online and retail stores.
* Currently, Apple sells its new iPhone models in the US configured for Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile (which is unlocked). A SIM-free option would mean that customers would be able to choose their own carrier, without having to worry about incompatibilities or restrictions, and use the handset overseas.
* Pricing for the unlocked iPhone 6 and 6 Plus should be similar to past models, with the 16GB version starting at $649.
