* The next-generation Apple TV will launch in October for less than $200, reports 9to5Mac. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet claims that company executives are still finalizing pricing, but the latest options call for a starting price of either $149 or $199.
* Since this will be considerably more expensive than other streaming media devices on the market, 9to5Mac says that Apple plans to keep the current third-gen Apple TV around. Its more modest $69 price tag will serve as an entry-level product into the Apple TV line.
* This older set-top box will be compatible with Apple’s upcoming streaming TV service, which is expected to launch via an update sometime next year. It will not, however, support the rumored Siri-input option for voice control or the App Store with native apps and games.
* These features will be exclusive to this year’s new Apple TV, along with its faster processor and refreshed user interface. The device is also said to include a new remote control, with a built-in touchpad, microphone for voice search and Nintendo Wii-like motion sensors.
* Apple is expected to unveil its new set-top box, alongside updated iPhones, at a media event in San Francisco on September 9. It’s rumored that the company is also looking to introduce new iPads at the event, but it’s possible they’ll do this at a standalone event in October.
