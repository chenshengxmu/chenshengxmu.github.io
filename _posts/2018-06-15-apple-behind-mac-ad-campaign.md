* Apple yesterday debuted a brand new advertising campaign titled “Behind the Mac” and focused on its computers, launching a series of videos that highlight individual stories by creators who have used Macs to “make something wonderful.”
* The Cupertino firm kicked off the new advertising campaign with a quartet of commercials uploaded to its official YouTube channel. The videos carry the tagline “Behind the Mac” and feature various creators, including photographer and disability advocate Bruce Hall, Music artist Grimes and Rwanda-based app developer Peter Kariuki.

* “Behind the Mac people are making wonderful things and so could you.”
* Song: “Story of an Artist” by Daniel Johnston
* “Entrepreneur and app developer Peter Karikui coded SafeMotos on his Mac. The app connects passengers with safe motorcycle taxi drivers across Rwanda.”
* “Using a Mac as a portable recording studio allows Grimes to make music on her own terms.”
* Song: “that’s what the drugs are for” by Grimes
* “As a photographer who is legally blind, Bruce Hall edits and retouches photos behind his Mac. With the help of accessibility features, Bruce can see the world around him.”
