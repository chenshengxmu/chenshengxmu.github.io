* Apple is reportedly designing and producing its own screens for future devices at a secret manufacturing facility in California, based on the emerging micro-LED display technology.
* According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman yesterday, Apple Watch should be the very first product from the Cupertino giant to incorporate Micro-LED technology. The author has learned from plugged-in sources that Tim Cook & Co. made “a significant investment” in the design and development of Micro-LED displays, which use a bunch of tiny chips to create images.
* Share prices of display makers nosedived following the report, with Japan Display dropping as much as 4.4%, Sharp tumbling as much as 3.3% and Samsung Display sliding 1.4%.
* The California facility is said to be too small for major production, but Apple will likely outsource mass-production to its supply partners in Asia. Of course, it wants to keep the proprietary technology away from its partners as long as possible, one of the people said.
* “We put a lot of money into the facility,” this person said. “It’s big enough to get through the engineering builds and lets us keep everything in-house during the development stages.”
* None of this will be easy because full commercialization of Micro-LED chips is held back by the slow progress in the development of appropriate mass transfer technology. Actually, the company almost killed the project a year or so ago, said Gurman.
* Currently, Apple’s Micro-LEDs are in the “advanced stage” although it will take two years until they start appearing in Apple Watch and three to five years for iPhone.
* Micro-LED chips are really tiny: a five-inch 400-by-600 pixel smartphone panel requires nearly one million Micro-LED chips, or 50 million units for a typical 4K TV panel.
* Micro-LED displays are said to consume 90 percent less power than their LCD counterparts and half the power of OLEDs, making them a potential OLED replacement. If Apple manages to solve yield and commercialization issues, future Micro-LED-outfitted Apple devices should bring increased battery performance and brighter screens.
* In addition to boosting battery life by as much as 300 percent versus LCDs, micro-LEDs allow for higher-resolution screens with improved color gamut and two to three times the brightness of OLED technology under the same power consumption.
* Some of the major benefits of Micro-LED technology include:
* Currently, both Apple and Samsung are said to be secretly developing Micro-LEDs. The iPhone maker back in 2014 acquired US-based Micro-LED developers LuxVue Technology.
