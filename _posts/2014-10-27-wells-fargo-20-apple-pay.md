* In an effort to encourage users to try out Apple Pay, Wells Fargo has launched a program that offers $20 to card holders who use the service. The rules are simple: make an Apple Pay purchase with your Wells Fargo Credit Card by November 30, 2014, and you’ll earn a $20 statement credit.
* The bank published the details of the promotion on its website early Monday, along with other Apple Pay information. Wells Fargo says that Apple Pay purchases are covered under its Zero Liability fraud protection service, and are also compatible with its popular loyalty rewards program.
* Folks looking to pickup the free $20 must attach their Wells Fargo card to their Apple Pay account (it appears the offer is limited to those who have not used their Wells Fargo card with Apple Pay), and complete a purchase before December. The credit should show up within 1-2 billing cycles.
* Unlike some merchants who are holding out on the service, banks and financial institutions seem to like Apple Pay and the added security it brings to transactions. They’re hoping that widespread adoption of the service can reduce fraudulent purchases, which they often have to issue refunds for.
