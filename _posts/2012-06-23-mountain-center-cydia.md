title: MountainCenter now available on Cydia
---
* MountainCenter, the jailbreak tweak that brings OS X Mountain Lion’s Notification Center to the iPad and iPhone, is now available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $2.99.
* While some may balk at that price point due to another similar tweak — MountainLionCenter — being available free of charge, Mountain Center provides you with more options, and support for devices other than the iPad. Be sure to check out our full walkthrough of MountainCenter for the entire scoop.
* Which tweak will you be using? Let us know what you think in the comments section.
