* Apple mays start providing after-sales service for Beats headphones and speakers soon, according to a report from Greek technology blog TechInGreek.com [Google Translate] which dug up an internal document showing that Apple Service Providers in the country are gearing up to provide service for Beats Electronics gear.
* If authorized Service Providers are going to be adding Beats after-sales service, Apple should follow suit.
* Indeed, “in the near future, Apple will be responsible for providing service to customers with Beats Electronics products and accessories,” reads the memo Apple sent out to its Service Providers.
* The news arrives hot on the heels of a Bloomberg report indicating Apple started removing Bose products from its retail store shelves. Bose in July filed a complaint alleging Beats used its patented noise-cancellation technology.
* According to Bloomberg last week, the two firms have settled their patent infringement suit and asked the International Trade Commission to cease its investigation.
* Following its $3 billion Beats buy, Apple’s been increasingly featuring Beats headphones and audio accessories on both the Online Apple Store and at brick-and-mortar locations, while promoting the Beats Music service to new iOS device owners and on the App Store.
