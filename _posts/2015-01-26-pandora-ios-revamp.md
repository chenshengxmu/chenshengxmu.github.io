* The iPhone edition of Pandora Radio, a music streaming service with more than 75 million listeners each month, has just received a visual makeover. The company previewed it almost two months ago, though the iPad edition hasn’t been refreshed today.
* Version 5.7 of Pandora Radio sports a cleaned-up appearance with fancy new transitions and animations. In addition to the facelift, the iPhone app also includes enhanced station personalization capabilities, improved artist discovery, greater use of thumbing and much more.
* The overhauled UI isn’t just prettier, it’s more functional than before. For example, you can seamlessly transition from the Station List to the Now Playing screen.
* To see what’s played on the station, just swipe left. To reveal more information about the song you’re listening to, tap the song or artist name or swipe up to reveal song details.
* Check out Pandor’s new look below.
* It sure reminds us a lot of Google’s Material Design.
* The new Personalization icon provides access to your thumb history where you can adjust your feedback for previously listened-to tracks by un-thumbing a song.
* Things have been moved around on the Station Details screen, too. You can now rename a station, add more variety to it and check out what artist or songs it was created from.
* Personalized genre and artist suggestions now appear prominently at the top of the station list.
* The iPad edition of Pandora is due for refresh at a later date.
* Pandora 5.7 changelog:
* Download Pandora for iPhone free in the App Store.
