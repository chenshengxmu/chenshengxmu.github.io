* Coloring for Grown-ups is a clever website dedicated to colorable pages of real-life adventures for the over-twenty-somethings out there. The site has been around for a few years and the co-founding duo, Ryan Hunter and Taige Jensen, have managed to produce three physical coloring books filled with adult-minded illustrations for the kid in you.
* The Coloring for Grown-Ups app recently found its way into the App Store. It is filled with dozens of pages of illustrations dating all the way back to the first web publications. We did some coloring ourselves, and have a hands-on review of Coloring for Grown-Ups for you now…
* Just like a coloring and activity book, this app is filled with page after page of illustrations. The thing that makes this different is that the illustrations tend to bring out the depression in you.
* You’ll see depictions of unhealthy relationships, regretful one-night stands, irritating families, and middle-aged midsections. There are also some fun activities, like tracing the beer bong tube to the complimentary recipient, drawing a picture of “the person you thought you’d grow up to be,” and the “walk-of-shame” maze. Each page has a clever picture for you to color.
* The app comes with an adjustable crayon and marker tool, as well as an eraser, which is something you don’t get with a real coloring book. You can also add text to the page using any of the included colors, or try your hand at “Drunk Mode” (more about that later).

* Turn the pages of your digital coloring book to get started. Find the picture that suits your mood. Maybe you are feeling too comfortable in your relationship, or you wonder what you’ve been doing with your life. There is an illustration for many of your most pathetic moments in life.
* Once you’ve picked the picture, you can start coloring. The app comes with 16 base colors, but you can manually adjust the hue, shade, and brightness of each one. Tap on the color dot below the list of markers or crayons to bring up the adjustment panel and drag the slider bar left or right to make the changes. The new color will be displayed in the tool icon in the bottom left corner of the screen.
* You can pinch in or out to zoom in or out. Use two fingers to move your view around on the page. To get into those tiny eyes, zoom in close and use the smallest ink line for the best results.
* You can increase or decrease the ink size of the marker or crayon by dragging your finger across the slider bar at the bottom center of the screen. The line size will also change with the eraser feature. To remove a mistake, tap the pink eraser in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can also undo a line by tapping the arrow-back button next to the eraser (you can redo that line, as well). To clear the entire page, double tap the pink eraser.
* You can add text to any page using any color. First, select the color you wish to use. You can fine-tune the shade and brightness here, too. Then, tap the text icon (Aa) to bring up the on-screen keyboard. Type your message and tap the check mark to confirm. Then, drag the text box to the location you want it to go and pinch-to-zoom to increase, decrease, or rotate the box. Tap the check mark to confirm.
* Remember when I mentioned Drunk Mode? Tap the red plastic cup at the bottom of the screen to turn it on. Your vision will blur and, no matter where you touch the screen to begin coloring, you’ll miss. Believe me. It’s about as drunk coloring as you can get without actually being three sheets to the wind.

* Hilariousness. I can’t count the number of times I shook my head as I related to the various illustrations.
* I also like that the developers have made a sort of game out of coloring. There are 15 achievements that unlock new pages to color.
* Nothing. Unless you relate to the illustrations too well. Then, the whole thing will just be sad for you.
* Coloring for Grown-Ups costs $2.99. It comes with nearly four-dozen unique pages with illustrations and activities from all three of the physical books. Even if you don’t want to color, the drawings alone are worth three bucks. You can even share your finished (or unfinished, if you are unmotivated) work with others on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.
* I giggled a lot while searching for the perfect page to color. If you have a lowbrow sense of humor and get a kick out of the juxtaposition of coloring adult-minded pictures, you are in for a treat. This app is available on the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. Download it in the App Store today.
* Is there any app like this? I’ve never seen one. However, Penguin, who distributes it, has another funny title, Adult Mad Libs. Frankly, every Mad Libs I do is adult.
