* Apple has released a fix for the FaceTime app on older versions of OS X, specifically OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
* Users of older software, as we reported last week, have been seeing issues with FaceTime, unable to connect and complete calls, for unknown reasons. Apple released version 1.0.5 of the $0.99 app to address the issue:
* This update resolves connection issues in FaceTime, and is recommended for all users of FaceTime on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
* Users on iOS 6 are still suffering from the problem. The Cupertino-based company hasn’t acknowledged the issue on its on its Support website, but a discussion on Apple’s support forum has several users complaining of connectivity issues – predominantly on iOS 6 devices.
* One forum user thinks upgrading iOS 6 devices to iOS 7 will be the only fix, as indicated by Apple customer support representatives:
* I could not get an official word from the Apple reps I spoke to, but was told repeatedly on the phone today that the problem was introduced when server engineer’s changed something and the only fix they are willing to put out is in the latest version of iOS 7. There will be no fix (as far as he has been told) for older versions of iOS, including iOS 6 and iOS 5.
* What are you experiencing on your iOS device?
