* Apparently I’m not alone in my thoughts about Apple’s stock weather theme for Notification Center — it’s a bit lacking in style.
* NC weather widgets is a jailbreak tweak that adds custom Notification Center themes to iOS 5 via WinterBoard with just a few steps.
* Step right inside to see how the improved weather icons look like on video…
* NC weather widgets includes three built in weather skins, and is a free download on Cydia. Keep in mind that it does use WinterBoard to accomplish the changes, so if you don’t like WinterBoard you’ll have to wait for an alternative solution.
* Do you think these new weather themes look better than Apple’s stock offering? I surely do.
