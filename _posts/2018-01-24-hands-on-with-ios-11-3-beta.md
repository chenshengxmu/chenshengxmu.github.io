* iOS 11.3 has been released in the first developer beta ahead of a full release this spring. Apple previewed it ahead of time, teasing many new features. From AirPlay 2 to Messages on iCloud, to new Animoji, Health records, and more, we’ve now gone hands-on with everything new you can expect in iOS 11.3.

* There is lots to love in this forthcoming update. Let’s take a look at a few of the best features.
* AirPlay 2 is Apple’s second generation to their AirPlay technology that allows you to cast audio (or video) to an AirPlay speaker or Apple TV.
* Version 2 is quite a bit more robust, and has the ability to steam audio to multiple rooms/speakers at the same time.

* The feature is similar to Sonos’ implementation that they’ve had out for a while.
* Multi-room audio is a difficult beast to tackle and has been delayed by Apple quite a few times. The HomePod is even launching without it, pledging support later this year.
* Check out our hands-on experience with AirPlay 2, where while buggy, left us impressed.
* Messages on iCloud is another oft delayed feature, intended to ship with iOS 11 last fall.

* It allows all your messages to be stored in iCloud, reducing your storage locally, and keeping them in check across devices. Now whenever you set up a new device, your history is there. When you delete a message on one device, it is deleted everywhere.
* Health is something I am very interested in, and the new feature to the Health app gets me very excited.
* The new record section will bring all of your tests and health data from different sources to one location. When you have a blood test, your results can go straight from your doctor to the Health app on your phone.

* Currently, it only supports a limited number of health networks and hospitals in beta, but more will be added in the future.
* ARKit got an update to version 1.5, bringing a number of noticeable improvements.
* It now is able to track vertical surfaces such as walls and windows, as well as horizontal.
* When viewing through the camera, the image is now at a 50% higher resolution, and it does a much better job at tracking irregular objects like circular tables.
* If you’ve got an iPhone X, there are now several new Animoji characters to animate your facial expressions.

* Bringing the number to a cool 16, we have a bear, skull, dragon, and lion available.
* Here is our running list, be sure to let us know in the comments of anything else you may spot.
