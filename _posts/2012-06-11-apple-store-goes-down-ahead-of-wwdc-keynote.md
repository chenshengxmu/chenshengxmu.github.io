* That’s it folks, the Apple Store has just gone offline ahead of today’s WWDC keynote, which begins in a little bit more than two hours. Are you feeling the excitement yet?
* As the big event approaches, possible specs of Apple’s new MacBooks have leaked, indicating that MacBook Airs will come with 4GB/8GB RAM flavors and a 512GB SSD option. SSD in these new Airs should use SATA3 and some of them are said to be based on Samsung’s crazy fast 830 series.
* New MacBook Pro and Mac Pros are also in the cards and the AirPort Express base station is said to be due for an upgrade as well…
* And another last-minute leak by 9to5Mac claims that Retina MacBook Pros will include the following specs and models:
* MC975LL/A – MBP 15.4/2.3/8GB/256GB FLASH-USA MC976LL/A – MBP 15.4/2.6/8GB/512GB FLASH-USA MD831LL/A – MBP 15.4/2.7/16GB/768GB FLASH-USA
* These Mac-specific refreshes should come in addition to the confirmed iOS 6 software and a bunch of stuff we’re looking forward to, including availability information for OS X Mountain Lion, all-new 3D Maps, perhaps an announcement regarding the next iPhone and more.
