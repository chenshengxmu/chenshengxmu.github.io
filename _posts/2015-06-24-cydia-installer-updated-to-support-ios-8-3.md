* Cydia Installer just received an update, bringing the package to version 1.1.17. The update, which adds compatibility to TaiG’s iOS 8.3 jailbreak, is now available for download on jailbroken devices.

* As shown in the release notes, Cydia 1.1.17 is a bug fix release. On jailbroken iOS 8.3 devices, Cydia would report that it “cannot identify your device” while trying to access your Cydia account. This was, of course, due to the changes on iOS 8.3, and this update fixes that issue.
* Also noted in the change log is support for file:/// repo URLS. Recent versions of Cydia rejected local repo URLs due to an overly-limited filer on what URLs were valid and acceptable. Users can once again user file:/// repo URLs with Cydia 1.1.17.
* Again, if you’d like to download the latest version of Cydia, simply launch Cydia and you should be prompted to install the update upon refresh.
* Note that this is not a fix for Cydia Substrate. That change, which is in the hands of the TaiG team, is still forthcoming.
