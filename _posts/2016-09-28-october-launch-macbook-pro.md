* Apple is moving rapidly toward the launch of new MacBook Pro models, reports MacRumors. The site says it has learned that macOS 10.12.1 is largely focused on preparing the operating system to support the new laptop’s features, and it hopes to finalize the update by the end of next week so it can be loaded on the new hardware currently being produced by Apple’s supply chain.
* Our understanding is that Apple is planning to seed one more beta version of macOS 10.12.1 for developer and public beta testing early next week, with a goal of finalizing the software update by the end of that week so it can be loaded onto the new hardware currently being produced by Apple’s supply chain partners. 
* This timeline could of course change should last-minute bugs or other circumstances require adjustments to Apple’s plans, but if it holds true, it appears Apple could have its new MacBook Pro models ready to ship to customers some time in the second half of October.
* It’s been well over a year since Apple updated the MacBook Pro, and reports for the upcoming refresh indicate it’s going to be a significant one. Rumored features include an OLED touch bar, built-in Touch ID, and a larger trackpad. The MacBook Air, iMac and Mac Pro lines are also in need of updates, but it’s unclear of they—along with Apple’s new 5K display—will be ready next month.
