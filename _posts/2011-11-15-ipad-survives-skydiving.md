title: iPad Survives 1300ft Drop From a Parachute Just For Kicks, and Advertising

* In a novel publicity stunt, device case maker G-Form has thrown an iPad from the nose bleed-inducing height of 1300 feet.
* In order to prove just how strong the company’s iPad case really is, G-Form decided to drop one from a parachuting daredevil while a video plays on it, just for effect. As is predictably the case, if you’ll pardon the pun, the iPad survives the fall, though it is fair to say that the case itself has seen better days…
* We’re not entirely sure why you’d be wanting to throw an iPad from such a height, or even be watching a video while skydiving, but it’s always good to know that some accessory manufacturers are working on a solution should you wish to. Really.
* Check out the video that G-Form has released as part of its latest publicity drive, but if you’re the kind of person that isn’t so keen on heights it might be an idea to give this one a miss!
* What’s the highest you’ve ever dropped your iDevice from, and has it lived to tell the tale? If it was an iPhone 4 or 4S, we’re going to just assume it exploded!
