* iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus reportedly include unspecified hardware features designed to address battery health issues and allow for better performance management.
* The Verge perused Apple’s public response to questions from Senator John Thune, released today, finding a line that appears to suggest that the newest iPhone models feature unspecified “hardware updates” that allow for better performance management.
* This sounds like iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus might not need to throttle their CPUs as their batteries age in order to avoid random shutdowns, like we saw with iPhone SE and the iPhone 6/6s/7 series. Apple today seeded a second beta of iOS 11.3 to developers which provides the promised new battery health and CPU throttling features.

* Asked whether it would release a similar software update for newer models, Apple said:
* iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X models include hardware updates that allow a more advanced performance management system that more precisely allows iOS to anticipate and avoid an unexpected shutdown.
* As The Verge observes, Apple’s response doesn’t say that it won’t release a CPU-throttling iOS update for the newest iPhones, but it certainly implies that it won’t.

* In its letter to Congress, the Cupertino company also raised the possibility of offering rebates to customers who previously purchased full-price iPhone batteries.
