* A good chunk of Twitter users use Tweetbot instead of the stock Twitter app because it has a unique appearance and a bevy of useful features. Nevertheless, some would say it could be better.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called SaveBot by iOS developer iTheGentle expands upon Tweetbot’s functionality by empowering users with the ability to save videos directly from their timelines.
* After installation, the user can simply tap and hold on a video from their timeline or from someone’s profile to save it directly to the Photo Library.
* It’s a particularly handy feature to have available when you come across a video trailer or any other kind of media shared by someone you follow that you want to save and watch again later on.
* SaveBot doesn’t have any options to configure, so after you install the tweak, you can kill the Tweetbot app from the App Switcher and re-launch it again begin take advantage of the tweak.
* TweetBot is required to use SaveBot, so if you’re not already using it, you can download Tweetbot from the App Store for $9.99. If you’re using the free Twitter app instead of Tweetbot, then this tweak unfortunately won’t work for you.
* SaveBot can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 9.3-10 devices.
* Do you think the ability to save videos from your Tweetbot timeline will be useful? Share in the comments below!
