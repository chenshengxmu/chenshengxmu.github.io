* PushTone is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to customize audible push notifications on an app to app basis.
* That means that you can change something like the standard Tweetbot notification into a duck quack, or any of the other alerts and ringtones available in the ringtone library.
* If you’ve been looking for a convenient method for customizing your alerts down to the app level, then look no further than PushTone…
* PushTone requires iOS 5, and only works with apps that are capable of sending out audible push alerts.
* Whether or not the $1.99 asking price is worth it to you will depend on how deep you want to take your iPhone’s customization. There are of course other methods for doing this, such as outright replacing the sounds via the iPhone’s file structure, but PushTone is one of the more elegant options.
* Another nice thing that I appreciate about PushTone is that you can outright kill all of the custom tones by utilizing a kill switch found in the Settings app.
* If you’re interested, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download it today, and don’t forget to let me know what you think about it below.
