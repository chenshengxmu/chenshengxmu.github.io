* Just in time for the SXSW conference, Tweetbot developer Tapbots has just issued a new version of its popular Twitter client for the iPhone and iPod touch. Tweetbot 3.3 is now available as a free update to existing owners and includes a larger image thumbnail option, another option to hide current tweets after muting, the ability to use Avenir as a new font option in the display settings and more. I’ve included some additional tidbits, the screenies and your official changelog right after the break…
* Pictured top of post and below: the visual difference between the new Avenir font and the old Helvetica Neue option, available under the Display section of Tweetbot’s settings.

* And check out what happens when you mute a person or a list in Tweetbot 3.3: the app puts up a sweet prompt offering to remove (that is, hide) tweets and lists in your timeline that match your criteria.

* By the way, is anybody else’s Tweetbot data taking excess storage in iCloud backup?
* Mine’s a whopping 2.1 gigabytes! You can check yours in iOS Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup, then tap on your device’s iCloud backup to see how much cloud storage Tweetbot’s app data takes up as part of iCloud device backup.
* I know Apple’s SDK includes an option allowing developers to exclude temporary files and caches from iCloud backups. Now, even though I tweet out lots of media on a daily basis, that’s just too much wasted space in my iCloud backup for a Twitter client.
* If you have an idea what’s going on here, let me know down in the comments.
