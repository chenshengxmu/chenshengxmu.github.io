* Apple’s rumored mid-tier handset called the iPhone 5C is said to feature a plastic body much like the iPhone 3GS, only sturdier. Using polycarbonate plastic in place of the iPhone 5’s sensitive two-tone aluminum + glass combo should yield some much-needed advancements in the scratch resistance department, as shown in a video posted by Taiwan’s Apple Daily.
* The clip also gives us the exact measurements of the iPhone 5C’s rear shell which, despite rocking the same four-inch screen as the current iPhone 5, appears to be just slightly taller and thicker than its high-end counterpart…
* Taiwan’s Apple Daily has gone all out conducting a stress test of the purported iPhone 5C shell by shaking it in a plastic bag together with a bunch of keys and coins – the items you’d typically find in your pocket.
* The website cites its sources as claiming that the plastic iPhone sports a surface hardness of 8H on the pencil hardness test, or three times stronger than the regular PET film used to protect the iPhone’s display from scratches.

* Another thing to glean from the clip: colors.
* If the video is an indication, the iPhone 5C will be offered in red, green, white and blue, matching up previous rumors pretty nicely. There could also be a yellow iPhone 5C variant, according to a recent backplate leak.

* As for the dimensions, the rear shell is 59.33mm wide, 124.55mm tall and 8.98mm deep.
* This compares to the iPhone 5 which measures 58.6mm wide, 123.8mm tall and 7.6mm deep. The slightly wider and taller and a tad thicker iPhone 5C enclosure could be contributed to the use of polycarbonate plastic instead of aluminum.
* The video briefly shows a comparison shot of the iPhone 5 backplate versus the blue iPhone 5S rear shell which we actually spotted earlier today on Sina Weibo (but can’t vouch for its authenticity).

* The blog corroborates earlier claims in terms of internals, reiterating the device will include an improved back camera with dual-LED flash for better low-light performance, as well as pretty much the same internals as the iPhone 5 – again, in line with analysts’ expectations of the iPhone 5C replacing the iPhone 5.
* Considering the iPhone 5 attracts scratches and dings so easily, the iPhone 5C’s scratch-resistant body and more affordable price should make it a hit with cash-strapped buyers.
* Apple should reveal the iPhone 5S and 5C at a media event on September 10.
