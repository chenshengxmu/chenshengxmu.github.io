* In addition to the iPad mini, and a handful of other announcements, Apple is widely expected to unveil a tweaked version of its current full-sized tablet at its media event tomorrow.
* The retooled slate is said to feature a handful of changes, including Apple’s new Lightning connector, a global LTE chip and, if these images are legit, an improved FaceTime camera…
* BGR posts a pair of photos tonight of what it believes is a display assembly from a refreshed third gen iPad, pointing to the larger camera sensor cutout versus that of the current model.
* “The most noticeable changes we can see are the fact that the front-facing camera cutout is larger than the previous model, allowing Apple to include a bigger sensor. We’d bet that Apple will continue the 1.2 megapixel FaceTime HD camera from the iPhone 5 and iPod touch here.”
* The site says it’s possible the display belongs to Apple’s next-generation tablet, which would assumably appear early next year. But it’s confident it’s a part from the aforementioned model.
* If true, the retooled iPad looks like it’s going to be quite the upgrade over its 6 month-old predecessor, with new display technology, the new Lightning port and a FaceTime HD camera.
* We’ll find out for sure tomorrow morning. Remember, the event kicks off at 10am PST and we’ll covering it and all other Apple announcements right here on iDB.
* So, what do you make of this tweaked third gen iPad? Smart move on Apple’s part?
