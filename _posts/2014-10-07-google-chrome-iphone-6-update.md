* The Internet giant Google on Tuesday issued a small update to its Chrome for iOS browser, adding better support for the “Retina HD” iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens.
* The free download also enables another interesting feature — the ability to download and open files directly in the Google Drive application, if installed on your device. Finally, this release includes customary bug fixes and stability improvements.
* Google Chrome is available free in the App Store.
* Last month, Chrome for iOS received timely support for App Extensions in the multi-purpose systemwide iOS 8 Share menu, following an emergency fix soon after iOS 8 launched for public consumption.
* Google Chrome 38.0.2125.59 changelog:
* In addition to Chrome, Google today updated YouTube for the iPhone and iPad with a fix for the “Add to Playlist” issue, along with a few other minor bugs.
* And just yesterday, the search monster refreshed Gmail for iOS with support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus display sizes and previously rebranded the Currents app as Google Play Newsstand.
* Google Chrome is a free download in the App Store.
