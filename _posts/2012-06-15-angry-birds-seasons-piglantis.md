title: Angry Birds Seasons gets 30 water-themed levels
---
* Two weeks ago, Finnish developer Rovio updated Angry Birds Space, the latest installment of its addictive pig-pounding series, with a bunch of food-themed levels. Today, Angry Birds Seasons gets some love as Rovio issues a free summer update which brings thirty new underwater levels.
* Building upon the concept of gravity first introduced in Angry Birds Space, Rovio has now brought gravity-defying action to the Seasons. You can fling the birds underwater and, yes – pigs sink to the bottom of the ocean…
* And in the aquatic wonderland of Piglands, birds and wood of course float. As a bonus, the lagoon kingdom conveniently features the tropical King Pig boss character. You’ll also love the aquatic sounds that add up to the atmosphere.
* Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Seasons HD are free updates available right now on the App Store and Google’s Play Store for Android.
* To celebrate the launch of the Piglantis pack, Rovio is giving away a very limited batch of postcards, exclusively printed for one randomly selected winner.

* To enter the competition, tweet a summer-related message you’d like to see printed on the back of a postcard with the #welcometopiglantis hashtag. Competition ends after the weekend, on Monday June 18 at 12pm GMT.
* Angry Birds have been around for awhile and Rovio did the right move by coming up with gravity-defying fun to freshen up the series.
* Or perhaps the series has run its course?
