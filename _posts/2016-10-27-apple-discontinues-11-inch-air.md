* Alongside the introduction of its brand new MacBook Pro laptop on Thursday, Apple announced that it has decided to discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air (except for in schools). It will continue to sell the 13-inch model with a starting price of $999, although it didn’t get an update today and likely won’t ever again.
* Apple has essentially positioned the just-announced entry-level MacBook Pro, which does not feature the Touch Bar or Touch ID and starts at $1,499, as a MacBook Air replacement. SVP Phil Schiller even compared the two on stage during today’s event, noting how much thinner and more powerful the Pro is.

* So to sum it up, Apple will continue to offer the 13-inch MacBook Air as a sub-$1000 option for the time being. Then there is the ultra-slim 12-inch Retina MacBook, which starts at $1,299. I imagine this will eventually take over as the cheaper/ultra portable model and then you’ll have the Pro for higher performance.
* The new MacBook Pro starts at $1,499 and is available for order today.
