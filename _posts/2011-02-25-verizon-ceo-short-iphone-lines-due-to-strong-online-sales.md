* Man, oh man; just what would we do if we didn’t have the Internet to fall back on as an excuse?
* As we’ve pointed out in the not too distant past, the Verizon iPhone 4 wasn’t as well adopted as the talking heads at Verizon wanted us to believe.
* Now they’ve given us a reason as to why we saw virtually no one queuing in line on that fateful morning, February 10th…

* According to Verizon Wireless CEO Dan Mead, what may have seemed like slow sales was actually the result of a drawn out plan by Verizon. “It was a conscious decision to spread the launch over three phases,” said Mr. Mead, “If we had not done online, you would have seen a much different flow in the pictures.”
* Our whole beef with this situation is that Verizon just won’t spill the beans about the actual sales figures.
* Personally, I think it’s great that Verizon wants to look out for the customer; I’m sure customers appreciated not having a repeat of AT&T’s iPhone 4 launch debacle last year.
* Still, with plenty of rumors circulating about the Verizon iPhone’s sluggish sales, it makes us wonder what the truth really is.
* Verizon says that they will release the figures during their next earnings release.
* What do you think? Is Verizon making excuses, or do you think this was really a part of their whole strategy?
