* Creating a bootable drive has many benefits and uses. For starters, it makes it easy to install a fresh copy of whatever operating system you have configured on the drive. Secondly, it makes it easy to install an operating system on a separate partition, or on a virtual machine. Lastly, it’s just smart business to always have a quickly accessible and portable installation media laying around.
* In this tutorial and video walkthrough, I’ll show you how to create a bootable USB drive for OS X El Capitan in just a few easy steps
* Note: your USB flash drive must be at least 8GB in size. Ensure that there’s nothing on the drive that you wish to keep, as this process will completely erase the drive including any volumes.
* The drive creation take about 30 minutes total, but your mileage may vary. Just be patient.
* Step 1: Connect the flash drive to your Mac
* Step 2: Download and install the latest version of DiskMakerX
* Step 3: Run DiskMakerX
* Step 4: Click Yosemite (10.10) since there is no option available for El Capitan currently
* Step 5: Click Select an Install file…
* Step 6: In the Applications folder, select Install OS X 10.11 and click Choose
* Step 7: Click An 8 GB USB thumb drive
* Step 8: Select your USB flash drive and click Choose this disk
* Step 9: Click Erase then create the disk
* Step 10: Click Continue
* Step 11: Enter your administrator password when requested
* Step 12: Once the process is completed, click Quit
* You can now eject your USB key and keep it handy for future usage. You may choose to rename the name of the drive to El Capitan instead of Yosemite. Since DiskMakerX doesn’t yet have an El Capitan option, it will name it Yosemite.
* In future tutorials I will show you different methods for installing OS X El Capitan on your Mac, including via Virtual Machine and on a separate partition, using this bootable drive.
