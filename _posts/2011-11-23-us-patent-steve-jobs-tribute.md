* It’s been over a month now since Steve Jobs passed away, and people around the world are still trying to find ways to pay their respects to the fallen leader. We’ve seen several tributes to Jobs over the past 30 days, but perhaps none more touching than this.
* The New York Times points to a new exhibit erected in the United States Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Virginia in honor of the late CEO. The display, which is made up of 30 giant iPhones, showcases all of the inventor’s 300+ patents…
* Steve’s name is attached to some of Apple’s most important patents, including several pertaining to its popular iPhone and iPad products. In fact, one of his patents was recently used down in Australia to help win an injunction against Samsung’s Galaxy tablet.
* From The New York Times article:
* “Many have viewed Mr. Jobs’s key role at Apple as that of business negotiator, but according to the patent records, he was quite the prolific inventor. Patents that list Mr. Jobs as an inventor or co-inventor include the design of a touch tablet computer (which we now call the iPad), Apple’s iconic power “brick” used to charge notebooks, and the desk lamplike iMac made in 2002.”
* If you happen to be in Alexandria, Virginia in the near future, you’ll definitely want to check out the exhibit. It’s free and open to the public until January 15th.
