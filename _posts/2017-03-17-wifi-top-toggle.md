* If you ever want to change Wi-Fi-related settings on your device, you typically go into the Wi-Fi section of the Settings app where you can then toggle the feature on or off on demand and/or pick the network you want to connect to.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called WiFi Top Toggle by Mohamed Marbouh does a little bit of rearranging in your Settings → Wi-Fi preferences pane, yielding an end result that feels tidier.
* You’ll notice right off the bat what’s different in the before and after image above; the Wi-Fi toggle switch is moved out of the preferences pane cells and is instead added to the navigation bar.
* Is it a little weird? At first, probably; especially if you’ve been using iOS for so long that you’re not used to seeing things like this. On the other hand, I find myself getting used to the change rather quickly. Now I almost wish all of my iOS preference panes were like this (Bluetooth, Location, etc…)
* The tweak removes some of the unwanted clutter from the chaotic Wi-Fi preferences pane. Anyone who’s ever around tons of Wi-Fi networks knows just how long the list can get, so having an unnecessary toggle switch out of your way gives you more room for looking at available networks at a glance.
* WiFi Top Toggle is available for free in Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works with jailbroken iOS 10 devices. There are no options to configure after installation.
* This tweak is open source, so if you like seeing what makes things tick, you might want to pay yourself a visit to the developer’s GitHub page.
