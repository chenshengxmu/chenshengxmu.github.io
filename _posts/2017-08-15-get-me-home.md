* Sometimes you need to get home, and whether you’re too intoxicated because you had one too many drink or you’re just too tired to drive, both Lyft and Uber offer convenient transportation services to get you from point A to point B safely.
* Both services have apps to make summoning transportation easy for you, but if you want to make things even easier, then you might like a new jailbreak tweak called Get Me Home by iOS developer Tom Effects.
* This tweak works in tandem with either the Lyft or Uber app on your device (yes, installation required) to help you get a ride from your current location directly through Spotlight search.
* When you’re in need of a ride, all you need to do is say something along the following lines:
* Perfect punctuation isn’t required for this to work, but spelling it. As long as you have the respective app installed and you enter the correct phrase wording into Spotlight search, either of the services can be summoned to your location.
* The tweak adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can customize your experience before ever using it:

* Here, you can:
* A respring is necessary every time you make changes to your tweak’s settings, so a complimentary respring button is included in the preference pane for your convenience.
* Notably, most people aren’t longitude and latitude gurus, so a free NASA-based tool is included in the preference pane via the “Find your longitude and latitude” button for your convenience.
* You will want to figure the longitude and latitude of the location you want the Lyft or Uber to take you to. In most cases, that will be your house. Of course, you can put any longitude and latitude in these fields that you want to, theoretically.
* If you’re not already using the Lyft or Uber app, they can be downloaded for free from the App Store. Get Me Home is a paid jailbreak tweak available for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
