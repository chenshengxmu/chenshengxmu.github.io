* Following a teaser trailer for the Steve Jobs movie we saw back in May, Universal on Wednesday released the full official trailer for the forthcoming flick.
* “Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter,” teases Universal Pictures.
* The trailer is two minutes and forty seconds long.
* Written by Aaron Sorkin and based on the official Steve Jobs bio book by Walter Isaacson, ‘Steve Jobs’ stars Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs, Seth Rogen as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, an original member of the Macintosh team, Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, former Apple CEO, and more.
* The film also stars Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan, Jobs’ ex-girlfriend, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld, one of the original members of the Apple Macintosh development team.
* The producers are Mark Gordon, Guymon Casady of Film 360, Scott Rudin and Academy Award winner Christian Colson.
* Directed by Danny Boyle, the flick depicts Jobs’ childhood home in Los Altos, California and revolves around three pivotal moments in Apple’s history: the debut of the original Macintosh, the unveiling of the NeXT computer and the introduction of the iPod music player.
* Sony had originally been set to produce the film, but the company dropped it and Universal Pictures took it up. The bio pic will release on Friday, October 9, 2015.
* Though I don’t think they could have found an actor who looks less like Steve Jobs, I still have a good feeling about the acting, screenplay and production quality.
* What do you think about this in-depth trailer?
* And will you be buying a ticket come this fall?
