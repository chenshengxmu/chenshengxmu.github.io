* Unfold — the popular jailbreak tweak that brings an accordion style unlocking animation to your iPhone — is being updated with new features, including a new vertical unlock animation.
* Unfold 2.0, due soon on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for free, is an update that brings new features to an already solid jailbreak tweak. Developer, Jonas Gessner, provided us with a preview copy of Unfold 2.0 to try for ourselves. Take a look inside for a video walkthrough showcasing what we found…
* The new vertical mode worked just as you might imagine. Instead of a horizontal accordion style, the effect is designed to work vertically up towards the status bar.

* There’s also a new provision to select the number of slices that appear in the unfold effect. You can choose as little as one, for a outwardly swinging window effect, all the way up to ten for an extreme accordion effect.

* Lastly, there’s a section for customizing the text on the lock screen. By default it reads “unfold to unlock”, but you can alter it to say anything you want.

* Unfold is a pretty generous offering from the developer. He could have likely charged upwards of $2.00, and still had quite a few legitimate customers, but instead decided to provide his work free of charge. It’d be one thing if this was a half baked tweak, but it’s not; it’s really well designed, stable from my testing, and it looks good to boot.
* What do you think about Unfold 2.0? Are you anticipating trying it?
