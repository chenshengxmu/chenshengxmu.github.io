* The popular cross-platform desktop media player, VLC by VideoLan, has finally received its iOS 7 makeover in Monday’s version 2.2 update. Launching later today in the App Store, VLC for iOS 2.2 includes a number of new features and refinements, and a long list of bug fixes.
* Perhaps most notably, you can now stream media stored in your Google Drive and Dropbox. As you’d expect from any iOS 7 app refresh, there are some new multitouch gestures for easier navigation.
* VLC has always had a very robust support for non-iOS friendly audio and video file types and today’s update is no exception: matter of fact, VLC 2.2 expands on that with support for some new streaming formats and protocols…
* The new interface now feels in line with the overall iOS 7 design. I’m liking the new media player with its nicely done semi-translucent controls akin to the standard iOS media player.

* In addition to Google Drive integration, Dropbox streaming and standard iOS 7 swiping gestures for navigating around, VLC 2.2 comes with a startup tutorial which will get you up to speed quickly.

* Other refinements include an improved library view for your TV shows and audio, enhanced UPnP integration with downloading support, a few new streaming formats and protocols, a rewritten WiFi upload and stronger privacy when using the Passcode Lock feature.

* Other under-the-hood changes and bug fixes include the following:
* Oh, and they still support iOS 6, which is super nice!
* Download VLC for iOS free in the App Store.
* The new 2.2 update is slated to go live later today so don’t panic if it’s not live yet in your regional App Store.
