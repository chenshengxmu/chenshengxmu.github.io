* As the rumors recently suggested, TaiG has released a new jailbreak tool for Windows users to jailbreak iOS 8.2 beta 1 and beta 2. Now, Windows users can enjoy a jailbroken version of iOS 8.2 just like Mac users can.
* The tool, which comes in at version 1.3.0, is available for download from TaiG’s website right now. We will be back shortly with a full tutorial for Windows users.
* If you’re on a Mac, then check out our iOS 8.2 beta jailbreak Mac tutorial and video that we posted yesterday.
* It might seem weird that TaiG would release a jailbreak for a beta release, but consider this:
* Only users who are currently not on jailbreakable firmware, like iOS 8.1.3, should consider doing this. If you’re already jailbroken, then you should stick to your current jailbreak until a new jailbreak for publicly release firmware arrives.
* What do you think about TaiG releasing an update for the beta? Will you consider using it?
