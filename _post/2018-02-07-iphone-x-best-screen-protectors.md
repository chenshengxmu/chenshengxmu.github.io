* What’s one of the best things you can buy to protect a smartphone that is almost all screen? A screen protector of course. They’re fairly inexpensive and can save your iPhone X from nicks, scratches, or even worse.
* As with cases and other smartphone accessories, the market is overflowing with screen protector options. So we thought we would put together a roundup of some of our favorites to help you sift through the noise.
* As a former sales rep for a major wireless carrier, I can tell you that a screen protector is easily the best bang-for-your-buck accessory on the market. For a few dollars, and a few minutes of installation, you can protect your smartphone’s most important component—its touchscreen. Scuffs and scratches on the display can hamper your iPhone’s functionality, visibility, and can spread into larger cracks that will eventually require an expensive full-screen replacement.
* So not only can a screen protector save you money, it can also earn you money should you decide to resell the device at some point down the road. Again, from extensive experience, I can tell you that smartphones with cracks, scratches and other imperfections tend to have significantly lower resale values than those with flawless or near-flawless displays.
* I’m sure screen protectors come in all kinds of materials, but you could really boil it down to two categories: plastic and glass. Each one has their various pros and cons: tempered glass screen protectors are almost always more durable than plastic, look and feel more like the glass screens they are protecting, and are usually easier to install. They also tend to be more expensive than plastic screen protectors and can shatter on harder falls.
* Plastic screen protectors, on the other hand, are typically less expensive than glass and harder to install—if you’ve ever done it, or watched someone do it, you know what a pain this can be. But hey at least you don’t have to worry about them shattering, and some folks actually prefer the look and feel of plastic screen protectors vs. glass. The bottom line here is there are pluses and minuses for both materials, so for completeness, we’ve included both types of screen protectors in our roundup.
* So without further ado, here are the best iPhone X screen protectors.

* Tech Armor says its screen protector is made of “advanced technology HD ballistic glass,” which sounds like typical marketing speak, but here’s why we really like it: 0.3mm thin with a 9H rating for surface hardness, anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating, and it doesn’t mess with 3D Touch. The price below is for a 3-pack.

* This tempered glass screen protector from Maxboost is very similar to the Tech Armor, even in price, but it does have a few notable differences: it measures just 0.25mm thin and includes both hydrophobic and oleophobic clear layers to protect against spills and smudges. It also has an open edge design, to better work with cases, and comes with a lifetime warranty. 3-Pack.

* MediaDevil gets great customer reviews on Amazon for their screen protectors, and this one should be no different. Benefits of the ‘Magicscreen’ Crystal Clear protector include dry install, no added friction or ‘rainbow effect,’ no loss of adhesiveness over time, and no markings left when removed. Price is for a 2-pack.

* I’ve seen this Anker screen protector recommended on Reddit and across other social media sites, so I decided to check it out. It’s easy to install, case and 3D Touch-friendly, and it hits a 9H on the hardness scale. It also features DoubleDefence tech, meaning there are actually 2 layers of glass, for better protection from drops. 2-pack.

* The Vomach is a little more expensive than the other options listed here, but its 5-star customer rating on over 1,000 reviews suggests that it’s worth the price. Features include 9H+ scratch resistant surface, oleophobic and hydrophobic coating to protect against smudges and liquids, and Vomach is saying the protector is “shatterproof.” 2-pack.

* This tempered glass screen protector from Spigen came highly recommended by readers, as well as customers on Amazon (4-star rating on over 1,000), so we had to mention it. It ticks all of the right boxes: case-friendly, precise cutout, 9H-rated scratch protection and easy installation. Plus, you get Spigen’s risks-free lifetime replacement warranty. 2-pack.
* That’s all for now! Obviously we will update this list as we are made aware of and test new screen protectors. And as always, if you have any good suggestions that we might have missed, feel free to let us know about them in the comments and we’ll check them out.
