* If you forget your Apple Watch passcode and enter an incorrect passcode more than six times in the row, your Apple Watch will lock you out. You’ll then see a message that tells you to try entering your password again in a few minutes.
* But what if you simply can’t remember your passcode? What then? If that’s the case, then you’ll need to erase your Apple Watch, re-pair it with your iPhone, and restore from backup. Check out our tutorial that shows you how to reset your Apple Watch from your paired iPhone or from the Apple Watch itself.

* Keep in mind that this menu will only appear if your device is passcode locked.
* You can now set up your Apple Watch from scratch using our Apple Watch pairing tutorial, and from there, restore your Apple Watch from backup when asked.
* Make sure you have a look at our full Apple Watch tutorial page for details on getting more out of your Apple Watch.
