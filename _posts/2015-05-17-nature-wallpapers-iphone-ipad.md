* Every week, we aim to bring you fresh wallpapers for those beloved iOS devices. In an effort to provide quality images, the Wallpapers of the Week section is populated from walls we find scattered across the Internet, stumbled upon through Twitter, or submitted to me directly.
* The majority of todayâ€™s selection is from quality work by @AR72014. He is always posting great stuff to his Twitter timeline, from original work to modifications of different content. Step inside for some of his latest.
* You can find a constant stream of AR7 work via Twitter, but I also suggest downloading his wallpaper app. In the app, there is a repository of his current and archived work, which can be directly downloaded for your specific device.
* Below are three images that are considered modded. The original artwork was sourced by AR7 from different spots, then tailored for iPhone.
