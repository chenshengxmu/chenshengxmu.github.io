* Tweetbot for Mac with support for Yosemite’s design and a plethora of other improvements hit earlier in the month as a free upgrade for existing users. Monday, its developer Tapbots issued the first maintenance refresh bringing out support for a pair of Twitter’s recently introduced handy new features.
* Tweetbot 2.0.1 for Mac now lets you quote tweets using Twitter’s new embedded quoting feature. In addition, they’ve laid the groundwork for longer direct messages, a feature Twitter announced almost two weeks ago but hasn’t implemented yet.
* After you update your copy of Tweetbot to the new version, retweeting a tweet will offer you the option to use the new quotation format instead.
* To always retweet in this format, go to Tweetbot preferences and click the Quote Format option under the General tab.
* You’ll be presented with the following choices:
* Choose Copy Tweet to use the new tweet quotation feature going forward.

* Tweetbot 3 for iPhone picked up support for the new quotation format nearly two months ago. Unlike the typical retweet, this handy feature inserts the tweet between quotation marks and embeds the whole tweet like a card or photo.
* As for longer-than-140-characters direct messages, Tweetbot 2.0.1 packs in support for that so it should just work as soon as Twitter enables the feature on its servers.
* As you know, longer direct messages were announced along with news that Twitter’s CEO Dick Costolo will be stepping down effective as of July.
* Tweetbot 2.0.1 for Mac changelog:
* As mentioned before, the update is free if you’re an existing Tweetbot user.
* The 11.4-megabyte app requires a Mac running a 64-bit Intel chip and OS X 10.10 Yosemite or later.
* Tweetbot 2 for Mac is $12.99 in the Mac App Store.
