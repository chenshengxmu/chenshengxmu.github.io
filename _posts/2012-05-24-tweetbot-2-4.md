* Tweetbot, a popular Twitter client for iOS devices, just got updated with a couple new additions and various enhancements, including a reworked search view with location-based searching and nearby tweets.
* You will also love the combined search for people and terms, relocated Trends and People categories, offline supprot for favorites and read later services, improved keyword mute filters, basic smart quote support when composing and other nice-to-haves…
* A reworked interface brings Trends, People and Top Tweets under a new Browse section in the new Search tab.
* There’s also a dedicated Top Tweets section, with the ability to have top tweets appear in search results, marked by silver star violator.
* You can now change Trends to another location directly from the search and check out nearby tweets or change your location on a map to see different content.
* Mute options have been enhanced with the ability to mute mentions, block specific keywords or use regular expressions to really customize what you want to exclude from your view.
* More of your actions will now get queued when offline, such as marking a tweet as favorite.
* A bunch of other tweaks have made it into both iPhone and iPad versions, including holding down on an image in full-screen to reveal options.
* And if I might add, how about having one tap taking me to the tweet detail view?
* Here’s your changelog
* – Updated Search view – Nearby tweets added with ability to change location – Location-based keyword searches – Improved search box for efficiency. – Trends and People categories moved to browse section – Added Top Tweets in browse section – Can now change trends location from the search view – Double-tap search tab to open search with keyboard – Keyword mute filters (with regex option and ability to mute mentions as well) – Offline Favorite and Read Later support (for you subway passengers) – Basic smart quote support when composing (ex: quotes become smart quotes, … becomes an ellipsis, and — becomes an em dash) – When viewing an image full screen on the iPad you can hold down on it for options – List views now show one line of a list or profile description on the iPad – Top tweets show up in search results (marked by silver star violator) – Dismiss web and map views on the iPad with a 2-finger swipe down gesture. – Can now swipe to the right on profile views to go back one level – Improved find location speed and accuracy – Sending to pinboard now marks items as unread – Muting a client automatically mutes mentions from that client as well – Fixed iPad bug where you couldn’t take profile photos with the camera – Fixed missing tweet sound when publishing a tweet. – Various other bug fixes
* Tweetbot was also recently updated with new gestures and awesome iCloud sync that lets you browse tweets on one device and pick up right where you left off on the other.
* To learn more about this updated, I highly recommend the usually exhaustive in-depth look by Federico Viticci over at MacStories.
* Tweetbot for the iPhone/iPhone touch and iPad is priced at three bucks each.
* If you’re serious about tweeting, that’s certainly money well spent in my book.
* Version 2.4 is now live in the New Zealand App Store so give it a few hours as changes propagate through iTunes servers.
* Are you a Tweetbot user?
* Have any gripes with Tweetbot that you’d want to share with others down in the comments?
