* Developer Realmac Software recently addressed user confusion surrounding its Clear and Clear+ to-do apps for the iPhone and iPad by announcing that it will be migrating Clear+ users to Clear for free.
* Not only are they doing this to ensure that “as many people as possible can move to Clear” because Clear+ is now defunct, but also due to the fact that Apple doesn’t offer a way to migrate users between copies of an app.
* Realmac also added native iPad interface to Clear so now both Clear and Clear+ support all form-factor iOS devices. If I were you, I’d download Clear for free right away…
* The company announced in an open letter to users that “we’re going to do this twice in the next few weeks”. They will be soon launching a free update to Clear with reminders support and “much more in store for you in the coming months”.
* Go ahead, download Clear now free of charge.
* The offer is valid for the next 24 hours so act now if you’ve been eyeing this gesture-focused to-do app, but were put off by its asking price of $4.99
* Clear+ is available in the App Store for $4.99.
* Both Clear and Clear+ require iOS 7.0 or later.
* If you’re wondering about the difference between Clear+ and Clear, the two are identical in terms of features. However, Clear is supported and Clear+ won’t be, meaning it will no longer receive new updates.
* Realmac founder Dan Counsell himself acknowledged user confusion.
* “Ever since the launch of Clear+, we’ve heard from customers that they are excited to pick up Clear but uncertain which version to buy,” reads a post on his company’s blog.
