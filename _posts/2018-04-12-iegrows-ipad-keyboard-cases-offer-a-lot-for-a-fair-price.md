* Apple’s newest iPad —the 6th-generation 9.7”— follows in the footsteps of last year’s $329 iPad offering. It is an almost full-featured device, lacking in one area: it has no smart connector. Consequently, Bluetooth is the only wireless option for connecting your new iPad to a keyboard. No fear, however, as iEGrow has two Bluetooth keyboard cases that offer a lot for a very reasonable price. We go hands-on in this mini review of the iEGrow F8S iPad keyboard case and the F180 iPad keyboard with rotatable cover.
* The iEGrow F8S iPad keyboard case is a conventional clamshell keyboard case made of a sturdy and hefty aluminum finish, weighing in around 1.3 pounds. The case opens up folio-style to a maximum 130º angle and allows you to type away: no bells or whistles.

* It has a function row on the top of the keyboard, which is extremely useful on a mobile device such as the iPad. The keys themselves are excellent for typing on: very clicky, responsive, tactile, and a lot of key travel. I can type at nearly 100% speed, which is impressive from a mobile keyboard.
* Then bonus points: there are also seven colors (and three levels of brightness) of backlighting on the keys making for a functional, stylish typing experience with this case. A screen protector is recommended with this case, however, due to proximity of the screen to the keyboard’s keys when closed shut. At $56, this is a very affordable option you should consider.
* Buy for $56
* The first apparent difference between the F180 and the F8S is the swap for glossy plastic (with some aluminum-esque coating on the bottom side) rather than the fully aluminum finish on the F8S. The coating attracts fingerprints and oils and isn’t super attractive, but isn’t a deal breaker either. It features the same function row on top and a very similar, equally impressive typing experience with the keys: no problems whatsoever. The keys are backlit with the same seven color options, but the key lettering does not light up: only the key perimeters.

* The big story of this keyboard though, and the reason for the slightly larger footprint when compared to the F8S, is that there is a swivel hinge connecting the iPad to the case. You can fold the iPad completely flat (180º), and rotate it 365º. It is perfect for presentations, for media-viewing, for tablet mode, and Apple Pencil use. It is an extremely practical and well-executed design perk that really takes the keyboard to the next level. You will be sacrificing some portability, it is slightly heavier (~1.6 pounds), offers a larger keyboard, and features slightly inferior build quality, but the swivel functionality trumps those limitations in my opinion.
* Buy for $57
* Coming in around at $56 for the F8S and $57 for the F180, both keyboards are second-to-none if you’re looking for a solid typing experience for your iPad 6th/5th generation or your first-get iPad Air. Whether you’re looking for an aluminum clamshell or a plastic-aluminum combo with a rotating hinge as the determining factor, both are awesome options.
