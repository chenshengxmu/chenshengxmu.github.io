* Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo has managed to extract a cute new ringtone just for iPhone X from the iOS 11.1 code and share it on Twitter, with a Reddit user making a downloadable copy of the audio file that can be used as a ringtone on older iPhones.
* The exclusive iPhone X ringtone is called “Reflection”.
* For those of you who want to set it as your ringtone after downloading the audio file, we have a tutorial on how to add custom ringtones using only Garageband for iOS.
* This is what it sounds like.
* It sounds fresh, I love it a lot!
* “Reflection” replaces the “Opening” ringtone that has been used as the default option on iPhones since iOS 7. The original iPhone’s ringtone, “Marimba” is still included in iOS.
* To change ringtones on your iPhone, launch the Settings app and navigate to Sounds → Ringtone or Sounds & Haptics→ Ringtone.
* If you have previously purchased ringtones from iTunes Store, you can redownload them to your iPhone by choosing Download All Purchased Tones at the top of the page.
* iPhone X arrives this Friday, November 3.
* So, how are you guys liking the “Reflection” ringtone so far? Speaking of which, what’s your favorite stock ringtone on iPhone? Let us know down below in the comment section.
