* Things are starting to pick up regarding the iOS 5.1 jailbreak, as we’ve just received word that pod2g has hit another major milestone in his efforts to hack the latest version of Apple’s software.
* The security expert just tweeted “Heya! My iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1 is now untethered :-)” This is good news, considering the only jailbreak currently available for iOS 5.1 is tethered…
* The news is also exciting for a couple of other reasons. For one, it means that hackers are actively working on the 5.1 jailbreak. And two, it means that things are coming along nicely.
* We still don’t, however, have any kind of ETA for when the jailbreak will be released to the public, and if/when it will work with A5(X) devices. But at least we know we’re making progress.
* As always, we’ll let you know as soon as more information becomes available.
