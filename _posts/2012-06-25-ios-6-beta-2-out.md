* Apple has started pushing out iOS 6 beta 2 to developers this morning. It doesn’t appear to be available on the company’s dev site yet, but we are seeing it hit our devices via OTA.
* We’re installing the update now and will let you know if we spot any changes in the new software. One minor difference we’ve noticed already, is that the gears in the icon (shown above) now spin during installation.
* Update: added full change log and a video of the spinning gears animation
* Update 2: iOS 6 beta 2 is now available for download in the dev center…
* The following issues relate to using iOS SDK 6.0 to develop code.
* Address Book
* When an app is in a fresh privacy state and tries to present a ABNewPersonViewController, the user cannot dismiss that view controller properly even if they allow access to contacts. The user must force quit the app and relaunch.
* Apple TV
* Apple TV may restart while using the Remote app.
* Bonjour
* The NSNetService class and CFNetService APIs do not include P2P interfaces by default. To browse, register, or resolve services over P2P interfaces, an app needs to use the Bonjour DNSService*() APIs noted below.
* Setting the interfaceIndex parameter to kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny in the following API’s will not include P2P interfaces by default. To include P2P interfaces, you must now set the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P flag when using kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny or set the interfaceIndex to kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P. The affected APIs are:
* Game Center
* iCloud
* iMessage & FaceTime
* IOKit
* iTunes
* Maps
* Movie Player
* Reminders
* Security
* Shared Photo Stream
* Social
* Passbook
* UIKit
* Safari & WebKit
* User Experience
