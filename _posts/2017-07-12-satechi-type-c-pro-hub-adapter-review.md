* If USB-C is the future, the present still has lots of catching up to do, as we are still reliant on legacy standards such as HDMI, USB 3.0, SD cards, and more. That makes moving to the new MacBook Pro a little less convenient than we were promised, and unless you want to stock up on a set of new cables for all your peripherals, the next smart thing to do is to buy a USB-C hub.
* For the past several weeks, I’ve been using the Satechi Type-C Pro Hub Adapter, an all-in-one accessory that meets all of my needs when it comes to plugging stuff into my new MacBook Pro, and then some more.
* The Satechi Type-C Pro Hub Adapter was designed specifically for the new MacBook Pro. Made of brushed aluminium, and coming in either silver or space grey, the hub perfectly matches your MacBook Pro. Its slim and compact profile makes it easy to bring along.
* The adapter features one Thunderbolt 3 port, one USB-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, 4k HDMI, one SD and one Micro card reader. Ethernet, DisplayPort, Mini and Micro USB are notably absent.

* To plug it in, you will have to give up two of your USB-C ports, either to the right or left side of the machine.
* When it comes to tech specs, the Satechi hub should fit the needs of most users. Emphasis should be made on “most,” because clearly, if you need Ethernet, more than two USB 3.0 ports, and more than two USB-C ports, then this won’t cut it. But it should be more than enough for the above average user, me included.
* The Thunderbolt 3 port allows for pass-through charging for both the 13” (61W) and 15” (87W) MacBook Pro models, which can be convenient especially if you’re using an external USB-C monitor that can also charge your MacBook Pro when plugged in.
* That port delivers up to 40Gb/s data speeds, and pushes pixels to one 5K display, or two 4K displays at 60Hz. That makes it the perfect companion for your LG UltraFine monitor, if you could afford it after breaking the bank on that MacBook Pro…
* The HDMI port allows for 1080p video output at 60Hz, or up to 4K at 30Hz.
* Specs of other ports:
* If you haven’t already replaced all the cables you use with USB-C ones, the Satechi Type-C Pro Hub should be a great companion for you. Unless you need more than it has to offer, this accessory adds convenience without adding bulk to an otherwise slim computer.
* Quite frankly, I don’t have anything negative to say about this hub. It’s been performing as expected since I first received it several weeks ago. Although I feel compelled to note again that I am not an ultra pro user. I consider myself above average, and I feel this accessory is made for people like me.
* At $99 on Amazon, the Satechi Type-C Pro Hub isn’t cheap, but I feel confident enough to recommend it to anyone in the market for such a hub.
