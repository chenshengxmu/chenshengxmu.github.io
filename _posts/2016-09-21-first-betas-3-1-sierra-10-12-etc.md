* In addition to iOS 10.1, Apple on Wednesday released the first betas of watchOS 3.1, tvOS 10.0.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.1. Registered developers can grab the new software from Apple’s online developer portal, or via their respective over-the-air update methods.
* It’s not known yet what changes these updates will include, but we expect them to be more along the lines of bug fixes and improvements, rather than major new features. Apple released macOS 10.12 publicly on Tuesday, and watchOS 3/tvOS 10 early last week.
* Find something new we haven’t mentioned? Let us know down in the comments below!
