* It looks like Apple will be giving folks who pre-order the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus the option to pick up their devices in-store, rather than having to wait for them to be shipped to their houses. The retail iPhone page on Apple’s website invites users to pre-order the new handset, and choose to “have it shipped to you for free, or pick it up in store.”
* 9to5Mac says it has confirmed the news with several Apple Stores and representatives. Apparently the option to pickup the new iPhone in store will be available during the pre-order checkout process, and Apple will be setting up a second line for Personal Pickup at each of their stores on September 19th, when the handset officially goes on sale.
* Apple doesn’t typically give customers the in-store pickup option during major product pre-orders, or even on launch day, but it has in the past. For example, I was able to request Personal Pickup when pre-ordering the iPad Air, and my experience was fairly similar to the one described above. I was in and out of the store within 20 minutes.
* We’ll obviously know more about the process when it goes live tonight at 12:01 a.m. If you’ve never pre-ordered an Apple device before, or could use a refresher course on the matter, checkout our Survival Guide. We will let you know as soon as iPhone 6 pre-orders become available tonight, and keep you updated on carrier/model availability.
