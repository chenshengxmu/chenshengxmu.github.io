* Sorry FIFA fans, it looks like the popular soccer (futbol) game is going freemium this year. Electronic Arts made the not-so-surprising announcement during its Gamescom press conference in Germany this morning.
* This means that when FIFA 14, or whatever it’s going to be called, hits mobile devices later this year, it’ll utilize EA’s free-to-play business model. So while it’ll be free to download, it’ll likely be rife with in-app purchases…
* Engadget reports from the press conference:
* “Andrew Wilson is back out on-stage to talk FIFA. First up is FIFA Online, the free-to-play, Asia-centric version of the FIFA franchise.
* Apparently that free-to-play ethos is extending to FIFA mobile as well. This year’s FIFA mobile will arrive free of charge. Though, come on, of course there’ll be micro-transactions.”
* Of course, the news isn’t surprising. EA has seen a lot of success with the freemium business model, first with The Simpsons Tapped Out, and more recently with Real Racing 3 and Plants vs. Zombies 2. In fact, it announced on its latest earnings call that the App Store is now its biggest money-maker—over $90 million last quarter.
* Still, you hate to see titles go this route, because you know there’s going to be some kind of trade-off. Either you’re going to need an IAP to advance in the game, or you’re going to be endlessly annoyed by them, or both.
* Any thoughts on this?
