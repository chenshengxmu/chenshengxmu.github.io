* As you’ve probably noticed, Apple has been taking a lot of criticism over the new Maps application in iOS 6. Google Maps has been replaced in the software, in favor of Apple’s own in-house mapping solution. And for most people it’s just not up to snuff.
* The company commented on the criticism yesterday, telling AllThingsD that because it’s a cloud-based solution, Maps will get better as more people use it. But if you aren’t buying that, or just want to speed the process along, here’s what to do…
* The process to report a problem in the new Maps application is pretty simple, and the information will certainly help Apple out.
* And that’s all there is to it. A team of engineers will investigate your issue when they can, and hopefully it will be fixed in the not-so-distant future.
* You can also use the same above method to add a new location or business to Apple’s database. Just select Location is Missing when you’re on step #3, and drag the purple pin to the right spot. Then enter in the applicable information and tap Send.
* Just imagine, if everyone with iOS 6, or even half of them, did this every time they came across an error or missing location, Maps would improve rather quickly.
