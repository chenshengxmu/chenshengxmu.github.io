* Apple’s next iPhone should double LTE download speeds from a theoretical maximum of 150Mbps on the present-generation iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus up to 300Mbps on the next-generation ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus,’ according to a purported logic board leaked by 9to5Mac.
* A photo of the alleged ‘iPhone 6s’ logic board shows a chip identified as the MDM9635M module from Qualcomm, part of its ‘Gobi’ modem platform.
* Compared to Qualcomm’s MDM9625M module found inside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the new chip doubles LTE download speeds while operating more efficiently than its predecessor. It has, however, the same 50Mbps upload speed limit as its counterpart powering the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* It’s worth mentioning that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted back in January 2015 that 2015 iPhones would be outfitted with the Qualcomm MDM9635M baseband chip, though this is the first time we saw solid evidence of it.

* The MDM9635M was unveiled in November of 2013.
* According to Qualcomm, the chipset uses a 20-nanometer process technology which results in lower power consumption and a smaller overall package. In comparison, the LTE Category 4 Qualcomm module inside the current iPhones uses the 28-nanometer process.
* The MDM9635M enables high-resolution video streaming and ultra high-speed download speeds and supports LTE Advanced carrier aggregation for both LTE TDD and FDD Category 6, along with dual carrier HSUPA and dual band multi-carrier HSPA+.
* “The LTE Cat 6 device is designed to provide consumers with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps and more efficient power consumption,” according to Qualcomm.
* The modem is backwards compatible with major cellular technologies including WCDMA /MC-HSPA, CDMA 1x/EVDO Rev. B, GSM/EDGE and TD-SCDMA.
* The Gobi 9×35 modem also powers the Samsung Galaxy S5 Broadband LTE-A in South Korea, which files as the world’s first commercially available LTE-Advanced Cat 6 smartphone.
* Some carriers have already achieved 300Mbps cellular download speeds, which is equal to Category 6 LTE. That being said, your wireless provider will need to roll out support for 300Mbps LTE-Advanced with carrier aggregation before you’ll be able to surf the web twice as fast on 2015 iPhones and iPads.
* Still, it’s a nice feeling knowing that your next iPhone will be ready for the future and one step ahead of your wireless provider.
