* As expected, Twitter is going to be a big part of iOS 5. Apple’s goal was to make Twitter easier to use in iOS 5, and it seems that they’re going to succeed. In iOS 5, Apple has added “Single Sign On,” a feature that allows you to login to Twitter directly from your Settings app.
* Also as expected, Twitter has been integrated into the Photo and Camera apps. From now on, you can send pictures directly to Twitter without having to launch an app, or rely on a jailbreak tweak. In addition, you can tweet from Safari, from YouTube, or from Maps…
* Maybe the best of all, iOS 5 is bringing contact integration. You will now be able to use Twitter to automatically update the photos in your contact list.

* “iOS 5 makes it even easier to tweet from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Sign in once in Settings, and suddenly you can tweet directly from Safari, Photos, Camera, YouTube, or Maps. Want to mention or @reply to a friend? Contacts applies your friends’ Twitter usernames and profile pictures. So you can start typing a name and iOS 5 does the rest. You can even add a location to any tweet, no matter which app you’re tweeting from.”
* Thoughts?
