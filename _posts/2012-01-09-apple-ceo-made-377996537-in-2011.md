title: Apple CEO Made $377,996,537 in 2011
---
* 2011 wasn’t a bad year for Apple newly appointed CEO Tim Cook, who made almost $378 million:
* According to Apple’s 2012 Proxy Statement, Cook received a jaw dropping $377,996, 537 million in total compensation last year — which is $377,996,536 than his late predecessor made.
* Cook made a little over $900,000 in salary in 2011, but a massive bonus in restricted stock units vesting in two five-year increments and doled out with his appointment to the CEO slot, sent his total compensation into the stratosphere.
