* Ian Rogers, former Beats Music CEO and Apple Music’s Senior Director, has unexpectedly left Apple less than two months following the launch of Apple’s music-streaming service, according to The Financial Times newspaper on Friday.
* The executive is credited with crafting Beats 1 Radio, Apple’s free of charge 24/7 Internet radio available in more than a hundred countries, and shaping its playlists. He was also instrumental in hiring away Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe from his post at BBC Radio 1.
* Rogers resigned from Apple to join a Europe-based company “in an unrelated industry.” The wording shouldn’t surprise anyone: Rogers’ contract with Apple surely contains a non-competitive clause barring him from competing with his former employer in the same industry for a certain period of time.
* Apple confirmed to the financial newspaper the departure of its key music-streaming executive.
* “News of his departure caught colleagues off guard,” reads the article.
* As per LinkedIn, Rogers was Senior Director of Apple Music since August 2014 and Beats Music CEO between January 2013 and August 2014. He was among a group of executives that joined Apple following its $3 billion acquisition of Beats.
* Before leading Beats Music, Rogers ran Topspin, a music services startup that helps artists interact with their fans.
