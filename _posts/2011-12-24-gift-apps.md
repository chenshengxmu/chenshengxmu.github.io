* We are so close to Christmas day now that we can almost smell the ham, but that isn’t always good news. What if you haven’t yet managed to pick up the perfect gift for that Apple-lovin’ family member?
* If you’re all out of ideas, then how about giving the gift of apps?
* If you know someone who is getting an iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad this Christmas, then they will just love anything app related. You can pick up iTunes gift cards almost anywhere these days, and here is a quick reminder of how you can gift the perfect app, right from inside iTunes…
* If you have a particular app in mind, perhaps a great game like Infinity Blade 2 or Grand Theft Auto 3, then gifting them is a piece of Christmas cake.
* Simply find the app you wish to gift in iTunes and select the little drop-down arrow at the side of the app’s price. Here you will see a new button saying “Gift this App” which obviously allows you to do just that.

* The next screen allows you to either send the gift via email, or print your own ticket which you can then put in, say, a card. Enter a recipient’s name and email address, and that’s it. You can add a personal message should you so desire, too.
* Rinse and repeat the process until all your apps are gifted, and offer your friends and family something a little different this Christmas.
