* Facebook Watch, a new platform for original television shows on the social network, is going to roll out to all users in the US over the next few days, the company said Thursday.
* Announced in August, the new video platform replaces the Video tab in the mainland mobile Facebook app, as well as on desktop and TV. According to Facebook’s updated press release today, Watch will be broadly available to people in the United States over the next few dats.
* The company is promising hundreds of original episodic shows to choose from, live or recorded, that follow a theme or storyline. To help you keep up with the shows you follow, they’ve implemented a watchlist feature so you never miss out on the latest episodes.
* According to Facebook, Watch is personalized to help you discover new shows, organized around what your friends and communities are watching.
* Among other things, you’ll find the following sections:
* When watching a show, you can see comments and connect with friends and other viewers in real time or participate in a dedicated Facebook Group for the show.
* Facebook is available at no charge from App Store.
