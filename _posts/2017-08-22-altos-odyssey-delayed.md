* Alto’s Odyssey, a much anticipated sequel to the award-winning endless snowboarding odyssey, Alto’s Adventure, has been delayed a little because the team is going to need “a while longer” to bring the game to life, developer Snowman’s Ryan Cash told iDownloadBlog today.
* “It takes longer to build things right,” he added.
* He wouldn’t reveal the exact release date for Alto’s Odyssey. For what it’s worth, the game was supposed to release this summer.
* According to a post on the Snowman blog, as a small studio striving to make sure everything they release is “lasting and artful” they need more time to make the Alto’s Odyssey experience magical and to make sure people are truly delighted.
* “We’re announcing today that Alto’s Odyssey is going to take a little while longer to bring to life,” reads the post. “The endless desert still awaits, and it’s even vaster and more mysterious than we envisioned when we first conceptualized a new adventure for Alto and friends.”
