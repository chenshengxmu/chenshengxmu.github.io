* Verizon is no longer the only major US carrier without an unlimited data plan. As announced yesterday, the carrier’s newly launched Unlimited plan gives you unlimited 4G data, texts and minutes on a single smartphone or tablet in exchange for $80 per month, or $45 per month for four lines ($180 total).
* Those prices entail paper-free billing and AutoPay and exclude taxes. It’s unclear if Verizon’s access fees of $20 per month per smartphone and $10 per month per tablet apply to the new plan.
* Like with other carriers, you don’t really get truly unlimited data: consume more than 22 gigabytes of 4G LTE data per line in any given month and the system begins prioritizing usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion. For a limited time only, the big red carrier is offering a free iPhone 7/Plus, Google Pixel or another flagship smartphone to those who’d switch to the new plan.
* “You don’t have to settle for unlimited data on a discount network with low-quality video,” said Nancy Clark, head of marketing and sales operations for Verizon, in a not-so-subtle obvious dig at T-Mobile.
* “This awesome offer makes it easier than ever to experience unlimited data the way it is meant to be, all on a network that can handle the demands of a digital life.”
* You are free to add an additional line (up to ten lines) to your Unlimited plan for $20 per line per month. The new plan is available to new and existing customers starting today.
* Aside from unlimited data, texts and voice minutes, Verizon Unlimited includes high-definition video streaming, free calling and texting to Mexico and Canada, up to 500 megabytes per day of 4G LTE roaming in Mexico and Canada and up to ten gigabytes of 4G LTE hotspot tethering in the US.
* You can add more perks like a connected smartwatch, GizmoPal or other connected device for an additional $5 per month. Verizon’s TravelPass service is available for $10 per day (with 500 MB per day limit and 2G speeds after that) while overseas.
* Mobile Hotspot with 10 GB of 4G LTE data is included at no charge.
* However, spend more than ten gigabytes and your tethering speed drops from high-speed 4G LTE to the slower 3G standard. Verizon claims its network will manage all the activity customers undertake, but the most data-hungry data customers may still be deprioritized should the network get congested.

* As mentioned, new customers who would switch to Verizon and activate the new unlimited plan are eligible for a free iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or LG V20.
* This promotion is available for a limited time.
* You must bring your phone number to Verizon, sign up for the introductory Verizon Unlimited plan, select device payment and trade in one of the fifteen eligible devices. If you opt for device payment and trade in one of the six eligible devices, you can get one of the aforementioned flagship smartphones for just $5 per month.
