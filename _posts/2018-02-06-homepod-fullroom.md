* First HomePod reviews have now begun trickling in ahead of its scheduled arrival this Friday.
* TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino wrote in his detailed review of the Siri-driven smart speaker that a feature allowing the accessory to create a wider, more immersive soundstage by adding a second speaker to the mix is officially called “FullRoom”.
* In an apartment, HomePod could not be louder and more room filling.
* But at home, in a 20×30′ great room with carpet on the floor, I did find myself wishing for it to be louder. This should be solved once Apple ships FullRoom—its support for two HomePods to be used in tandem but not in stereo.
* That’s coming soon, followed at a later date by the multi-room function which lets a bunch of HomePods synchronize to play the same audio everywhere. But for now, small to medium-sized rooms are fine, big rooms you may find HomePod a smidge under powered.
* According to first HomePod reviews that dropped this morning, the mentioned feature will create stereo-like soundscape using advanced beam-forming capabilities that won’t require that users set one speaker as the right channel and another as the left channel.
* Panzarino added that only HomePod and Amazon’s Echo provide true unidirectionality of sound, noting that walking around the Apple device from one corner of a room to another, or around it in a circle, is an awesome experience. “The sound does not fall off at any angle, and the characteristics of the audio don’t change,” he said. “This just works.”
* That’s because HomePod includes another cool feature that allows the smart speaker to automatically and continually adapt itself to the environments it’s placed in.

* Apple’s website says that both multi-room audio support via AirPlay 2 and stereo pairing are coming “later this year” via an upcoming HomePod firmware update.

* Earlier in the morning, The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple published a detailed article covering Apple’s Audio Lab comprised of several non-reflective, echo-free anechoic chambers.
* Apple has used this facility to develop the beam-forming speaker array and high excursion woofer in HomePod, test Siri’s voice detection algorithms in loud environments and more.
