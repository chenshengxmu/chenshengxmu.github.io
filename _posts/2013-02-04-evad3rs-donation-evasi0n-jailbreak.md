* I usually put my money where my mouth is, and in this case, it means making a donation to the people who made it possible for me to run some of my favorite jailbreak tweaks again on my iPhone.
* If like me you can’t get the most out of your iOS device without a jailbreak, then you should consider making a donation too. Anything helps, whether it is a few cents or a few dollars…
* After making the donation, I received a confirmation email from Paypal showing that Jay Freeman (saurik) was the donation coordinator. It is my understanding that saurik is providing the infrastructure and will redistribute the donations later to all evad3rs team members, or at least to those who actually agree to take donations.
* Of course, no one is forcing you to make a donation, and while money is definitely not what drives iOS hackers like PlanetBeing, Pimskeks, MuscleNerd, or pod2g to work on jailbreaks, I’m sure they appreciate the gesture.
