title: MountainLionCenter now available on Cydia
---
* MountainLionCenter — the jailbreak tweak that adds an OS X Mountain Lion inspired Notification Center panel to your iPad, was just released on Cydia’s BigBoss repo as a free download.
* As noted yesterday, this is a feature that’s been long overdue; in my opinion, it makes Notification Center a lot less intrusive feeling on the iPad. Couple it with IntelliScreen X, and it’s even better.
* It should be noted, that despite my ability to get it working on my iPhone, the tweak has been released as iPad only, at least for the time being. Be sure to check out our full walkthrough of MountainLionCenter, and let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
