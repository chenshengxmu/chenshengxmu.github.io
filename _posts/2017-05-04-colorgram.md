* Instagram users typically get to see the app’s generic white interface introduced back in 2016, but if you’d like to add a splash of color to it, then you’ll love a new free jailbreak tweak release dubbed ColorGram by iOS developer Justin Petkovic.
* This tweak lets you go hands-on with colorizing various elements of the Instagram app so you don’t have to put up with the boring flat colors anymore.
* After installing ColorGram, a new preference pane gets added to the Settings app:

* It’s divided into sections, based on the app elements you can colorize or customize:

* Among the options you have from ColorGram are:
* For most of these options, you can enter your own hex-based color code. To get a specific color code, you can use this online tool. The text color option is the only one that’s limited to specific preset colors, and those include:
* While you certainly don’t have to customize each and every option and can customize just bits and pieces of the app instead, changing all of the settings to a uniform color scheme helps make the app look the best afterwards.
* Nevertheless, any tweaks dealing with aesthetics are going to yield different results from anyone you talk to, and that’s simply because everyone has a different opinion on what looks good. That said, what I like for an Instagram color scheme might not float your boat, or vice-versa.
* If you want to give ColorGram a try to play around with the colors for yourself, you can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $1.49. The tweak is compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 devices and works with Instagram version 10.19, which as of this writing, is the latest version that can be downloaded from the App Store.
