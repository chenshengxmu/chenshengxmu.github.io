* In addition to Verizon, Sprint, Walmart and other retailers, it appears that Radio Shack will also be offering iPhone 5c pre-orders tomorrow. The company will be offering every available color: red, blue, pink, green and yellow, on the top 3 carriers.
* Additionally, the electronics dealer is also offering discounts on a wide variety of iPhone 5, 4s and 4 handsets—you can get an iPhone 5 on Sprint for $149 on contract. You can also trade-in your old iPhone for up $250, depending on various factors…
* RadioShack’s revamped trade-in program allows iDevice users to get up to $250 for a working iPhone 5, $150 for an iPhone 4S, and $100 for an iPhone 4, depending on its condition. It’s worth noting that’s less than other gadgets resellers are offering.

* And honestly, you could probably find a better deal on an iPhone elsewhere as well. For instance, Apple is offering $100 discounts on iPhone 5 models through next week. And Walmart is offering $20 off the iPhone 5c and $10 off the iPhone 5s right now.
* At any rate, it looks like you will be able to pre-order an iPhone 5c at your local Radio Shack tomorrow. And if you happen to be trading in an old iPhone, you could essentially get it for free (on contract, of course). Online pre-orders begin tonight at midnight.
