* If you prefer to keep a backup of iPhone and iPad apps on your computer for safekeeping and miss the ability to browse iOS App Store and ringtones on iTunes Store using your Mac or Windows PC, Apple has now quietly released iTunes 12.6.3.
* iTunes 12.6.3 basically brings back a built-in App Store storefront and the ability to download ringtones from iTunes Store, the two features that were removed from last month’s iTunes 12.7.
* TUTORIAL: How to redownload your previously purchased ringtones on iPhone
* According to Apple’s support document, they’ve decided to provide this version of iTunes because “certain business partners might still need to use iTunes to install apps.”
* If you’ve already installed iTunes 12.7 or later, simply download iTunes 12.6.3 on your Mac or PC (32-bit or 64-bit) and run the installer.
* After installation is complete, you can continue to download iOS apps with iTunes.
* The company noted that this iTunes 12.6.3 won’t prompt you to download new versions. iTunes 12.6.3 also features support for iOS 11 and syncing with the latest iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X devices.
