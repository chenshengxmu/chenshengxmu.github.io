* Like other sites, we’ve been getting a lot of tips this evening that Wi-Fi in iOS 6 is acting up. Several of our readers have informed us that their Wi-Fi quit working after attempting to connect to a faulty Apple page shortly after updating to the latest version of iOS.
* Don’t worry, the problem has been pinpointed. As explained by developer Steve Streza, iOS devices are programmed to ping a test URL upon connecting to a Wi-Fi network to see if it’s protected by a “captive portal.” And that test page has been down all afternoon…
* Here’s more on that from Errata Security:
* “When an Apple iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod) connects to a WiFi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html.
* The purpose of this request is to discover if there is a “captive portal” in the way. A captive portal is when, after connecting to the WiFi, any web request you makes gets redirected to a login/ToS page. In order to continue, you must either login with a username/password (or sign up, then login), and/or access the Terms of Service.”
* Anyway, it sounds like Apple was able to correct this issue on their end, so no update will be necessary. But if you’re still having Wi-Fi problems, you can try the following:
* One of these methods should cure your iOS 6 Wi-Fi troubles. If not, be sure to let us know in the comments below.
