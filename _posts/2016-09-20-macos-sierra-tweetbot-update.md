* Tweetbot users will be happy to hear that the Tapbots have updated their popular Twitter client today to support the just-released macOS Sierra software. The release brings the app to version 2.4.2, and it includes several improvements.
* Among these improvements is support for extended Tweets—a change Twitter made to its service this week that prevents media URLs and Quote Tweets from counting against your 140 character limit. It also now supports extended videos.
* – Support for macOS Sierra – Support for extended Tweets: Photos, Videos, GIFs and Quote Tweets no longer count toward your 140 characters – Support for uploading videos up to 140 seconds long to Twitter – Better media previews for search results
* Tweetbot 2.4.2 is a free update for existing users, and $9.99 for new ones. It’s by far our favorite Twitter client for Mac. For more information on the macOS Sierra software update, be sure to check out our roundup of its top 60+ new features.
* Tweetbot is available in the Mac App Store for $10.
