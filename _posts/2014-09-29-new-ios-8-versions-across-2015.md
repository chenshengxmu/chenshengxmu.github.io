* Not one, not two, but three major updates to iOS 8 — iOS 8.1, iOS 8.2 and iOS 8.3 — are in tow for 2015, perhaps signaling that Apple is speeding up its iOS development process, Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac reported Monday.
* This would represent a break from Apple’s practice of releasing a major new iOS version each Fall, followed-up by a substantial update early in the following year.
* Gurman was able to confirm the three upcoming iOS 8 releases via “a developer of a major hardware-connected iOS application” who shared with him their analytics, in addition to traces of iOS 8.1, iOS 8.2 and iOS 8.3 spotted in Google Analytics for 9to5Mac.com.
* Apple typically starts work on an iOS update before a major version goes public.
* For instance, the Cupertino firm released a Gold Master version of iOS 8 (in most instances, a Gold Master is the same as the shipping version) on September 9, eight days ahead of the software’s September 17 public release.
* As soon as it released the GM and started preloading it on iPhones being manufactured, Apple started work on the next iOS 8 bug-fix update. Normally, Apple would be now developing iOS 8.1 and iOS 9.0 in parallel.
* But the fact that three significant follow-ups to iOS 8 are in concurrent development might indicate that the firm “is moving away from annual iOS releases in the fall that are tied to hardware,” Gurman speculated.
* Another possibility: Apple is readying new hardware outside the usual Fall release schedule. For instance, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro is said to release in early-2015.
* As that device is rumored to feature a split-screen multitasking mode, a major update to iOS 8 would be needed to support the feature.
* Other features that didn’t make it into the initial iOS 8 release that should go live in iOS 8.1: an improved Maps app with public transit directions and a car-finding feature, a standalone iTunes Radio app, native TextEdit and Preview apps and more.
* Last year, iOS 7 debuted in Fall and was followed by the major iOS 7.1 update with CarPlay and other improvements in March of 2014. Similarly, iOS 6 launched in September 2012 and was updated to iOS 6.1 in January the following year.
* At any rate, Apple may be planning to release major iOS 8 feature updates throughout 2015 in anticipation of iOS 9.0 in September 2015.
