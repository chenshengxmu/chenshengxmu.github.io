* The iPhone 5s might look like an iPhone 5 on the outside, but a few things have changed on the inside, making it, as you’ve probably guessed, the best iPhone yet.
* Apple usually doesn’t brag too much about specs because, as my wife says, “it’s not about the size of your processor, it’s about what you do with it.” All jokes aside, even though Apple dropped a few tech specs today, we wanted to gather them up all under one roof.
