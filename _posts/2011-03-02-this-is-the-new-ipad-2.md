* After months of speculations and rumors, Apple finally unveiled the iPad 2 today. Almost surprisingly, Steve Jobs was here to lead the presentation. As usual the event started with some big numbers: 100,000,000 iPhones in the world, 15,000,000 iPads sold, representing a 90% market share which generated $9.5 billion in revenue for Apple.
* Apple’s message today was pretty clear, the iPad is not a tablet, it’s a post-PC device. An indeed it is.
* Here is a quick summary of everything worth noting about the iPad 2:
* Apparently, you are not able to pre-order the iPad 2, which is kind of unusual. I sure hope Apple will let us do that prior to March 11 as I don’t feel like standing in line for hours.
