* Enthusiasts have discovered that the macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 developer beta code comes with subtle hints at a desktop Podcasts app, possibly indicating that podcasts might be unbundled from iTunes in favor of a standalone app.
* Apple’s Podcasts app is currently available for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.
* Digging through macOS 10.13.4, 9to5Mac noticed that the software includes privacy information for a non-existent Podcasts app for macOS. The publication took it as a sign that the Podcasts app may be coming to macOS soon.
* From the report:
* This privacy information indicates that a user’s podcast listening is linked to a random device identifier which is synced through iCloud in a way that cannot be linked to other Apple services. Apple collects data about users’ listening habits to share with podcast publishers.
* The most interesting part is that it specifically mentions “Your use of the Podcast app is linked to your Apple ID”. We can’t be sure whether it’s just a typo and/or whether they left this privacy information on macOS by accident, but this could mean we’re going to see a Podcasts app for macOS in the future.
* But why stop there?
* My hope is that Apple will gradually unbundle all services from iTunes in favor of separate apps like on iOS. If you ask me, we should have a standalone app for Apple Music, a dedicated desktop TV app and so forth.
* As for iTunes’ syncing ability, there should be a separate app just for mobile device sync.
* Earlier today, we noted that code strings discovered from the iOS 11.3 developer beta reference a “modern iPad,“ potentially pointing to an upcoming iPad Pro refresh with a TrueDepth camera and Face ID that Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted would release this year.
* TIP: stop Podcasts for iOS from automatically advancing to the next episode
* Would a dedicated Podcasts app for Mac make sense, do you think?
