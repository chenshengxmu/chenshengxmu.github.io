* Aside from the “Hey Siri” response tone from the official video teaser for HomePod, we haven’t heard any other sounds that Apple’s wireless speaker will use when released this December.
* Thankfully, eagle-eyed developer Avery Magnotti saw to that, having managed to extract some really cool sounds that the device will use for feedback and user interactions.
* He’s managed to cull nine native M4A and WAV files from the unreleased IPSW firmware files for the device. Rather than re-use standard iOS sounds for notifications, alarms, timers and so forth, Apple’s created a whole new soundscape that’s unmistakably HomePod.
* Magnotti has put together a YouTube clip so you can listen for these sounds for yourself.
* Here’s the full list of the sound files, in the order they’re played:
* Although the device’s built-in LED matrix screen could be used to display information other than standard Siri graphics, audible feedback is essential for wireless speakers that are meant to be used hands-free and interacted with from across the room.
* As much as we’d love to host these sounds on iDownloadBlog so you could download and use them with your iPhone, we’d rather not as this is clearly copyrighted content. Theoretically, one could grab them from the HomePod’s IPSW firmware files residing on Apple’s servers.

* It’s also interesting that HomePod appears to have a set of voice triggers which Magnotti speculates could permit Apple to add extra language support without a firmware update.
* People who pored over the HomePod’s firmware files have unearthed a few other interesting tidbits about the speaker as well. For instance, the wireless speaker has one gigabyte of RAM and appears to run a full version of iOS with a shell app named “SoundBoard”.
* The sound file named “WOCAudioPasscodeTone.wav” is pretty curious. I wonder what it will be used for? I think it’s too quiet for an alarm, but the file name is puzzling me…
* Any ideas?
