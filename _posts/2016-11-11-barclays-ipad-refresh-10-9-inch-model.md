* Apple should update both iPad Pros next year, with analysts from the banking and financial services company Barclays calling for a brand new model to be added to the lineup. Supply chain sources Barclays recently quizzed think the new iPad Pro model will have a screen measuring 10.9 inches.
* And because that tablet is expected to adopt an all-new bezel-free design, its 10.9-inch screen could be fitted inside the current 9.7-inch package.
* Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley and Jerry Zhang suspect that engineering a 10.9-inch screen into the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro form factor may require putting the iconic Home button behind the display.
* Come next year, a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro is expected to become a “low cost” model alongside the 7.9-inch iPad mini, pictured below. Barclays expects the iPad mini 4 to continue selling throughout next year without a hardware refresh.

* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first predicted a trio of new iPad Pros in 2017: 9.7, 12.9 and a new 10.6-inch device. If you ask the fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara, display size of the new iPad Pro model will be10.1 inches diagonally.
* No matter the source, the reports agree on one thing: a new iPad Pro size is coming.
* While touring Asian supply chain, Barclays analysts reportedly heard that the delayed $159 AirPods earbuds will enter mass production in December, in time for Christmas.
* They also learned that next year’s iPhone 8 may include a brand new 5.8-inch model with a curved, bezel-free OLED display and an in-screen Home button that would presumably let engineers squeeze the bigger screen in the same overall form factor like the current 5.5-inch Apple handsets.
