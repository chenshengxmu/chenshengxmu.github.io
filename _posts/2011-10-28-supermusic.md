* SuperMusic is a jailbreak tweak that aims to add more options to the music controls that appear on your Lock screen.
* In addition to the basic back, pause/play, and forward buttons, SuperMusic adds fast-forward, rewind, stop, shuffle, and a full track listing of your music library right on your Lock screen.
* Check out the video inside to see how it works in action…
* As you can see, SuperMusic, while certainly a valiant attempt, needs a little work on the design front.
* It’s a good idea, but it simply crams too many options on the Lock screen at once. Hopefully further updates will resolve the aesthetic issues, because otherwise this could be a handy tweak.
* SuperMusic can be picked up on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.00, and works with jailbroken devices on iOS 4.1 or higher. Let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
