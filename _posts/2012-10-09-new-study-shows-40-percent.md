* Despite Samsung’s efforts to portray the iPhone as a device for older consumers, the iPhone is still extremely popular among teenagers. Piper Jaffray says that 40% of US teens now own the handset.
* Gene Munster, an analyst with the firm, released a report today on his survey of US teenagers regarding what gadgets they’re using. And judging from the results, Apple’s iPhone and iPad are still on top…

* MacRumors points to the report, which covers the findings of Munster’s bi-annual poll involving more than 7,700 teens. As you can see, 40% of those queried own an iPhone, up from 34% in the spring.
* The survey also found that 44% of US teens now own some sort of tablet device — 72% of those are iPads. And of the 35% of those who don’t have a table yet, but plan on getting one, 74% are looking at iPads.
* In addition to the iPhone and iPad numbers, Munster’s poll found that Apple’s rumored iPad mini could be a huge hit with teenagers. 43% of the teens surveyed said they’d likely buy a smaller $299 iPad.
* As usual, it’s worth pointing out that a 7,700 person survey is extremely small in the grand scheme of things. But if nothing else, it does provide some insight into what gadgets teens are using these days.
* Thoughts?
