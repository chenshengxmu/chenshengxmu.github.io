* Foursquare unveiled Swarm in March of last year to give the location check-in ability of the main iOS app a brand new place of its own. Not all of the features of Foursquare for iOS have made it into the dedicated app, namely mayorships.
* Arguably the most popular feature—especially if you’re into the check-in game—mayorships are now back in the latest Swarm 2.5 for iPhone update.
* You can earn them by checking in more than anyone else, which will unlock a shiny new mayor crown.
* Specifically, to become a mayor of a place, check in more than anyone else in the last 30 days. To make things more interesting and game-fied, only 1 check in per day counts (ties go to the reigning mayor) and others will be trying to steal mayorships from you.
* And when you earn a crown, unlock a sticker, or simply are proud of your check-in, you can now share it to Facebook or Twitter with a single tap.
* “And we’ve got even more packed into this release,” release notes tease without specifying the remaining improvements in this Swarm release.
* The app makes it easy to check in to nearby places right from your Lock screen with a handy Notification Center widget on iPhones running iOS 8, and includes a WatchKit component along with a glance for your Apple Watch.
* The 25.9-megabyte app requires an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Swarm by Foursquare at no charge in the App Store.
