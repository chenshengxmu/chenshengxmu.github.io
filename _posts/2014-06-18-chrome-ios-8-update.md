* Google’s free Chrome for iOS browser is one of a few dozen popular iPhone and iPad applications that crash or refuse to work properly on iOS 8. And although the second beta of iOS 8 claims improved compatibility with third-party software such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Chrome still wouldn’t work reliably.
* Acknowledging as much, the Internet giant has just issued a minor Chrome for iOS update with stability fixes and “compatibility with new iOS versions”…
* The Chrome Releases blog lists no other changes in Chrome version 35.0.1916.41 for the iPhone and iPad.
* This is interesting and confusing at the same time.
* For starters, I’m not unsure as to whether or not Google – or any other developer for that matter – is allowed to push iOS 8 app compatibility updates yet. On the other hand, I’m certainly glad they’ve acted so swiftly to make Chrome play nice with iOS 8.
* Download Google Chrome for iOS free in the App Store.
* The universal app requires iOS 6.0 or later.
