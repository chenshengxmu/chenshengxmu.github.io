* The iOS keyboard includes a key dedicated specifically to accessing the host of Emojis you can use to express your mood. Part of this interface includes a section for Emojis you use frequently, and while it can be useful, suggestions aren’t always ideal.
* With a new jailbreak tweak dubbed FavoriteEmojis by iOS developer Adeem Mawani, you can manually designate your favorite Emojis by choice; these are the ones that will begin populating the “Frequently Used.”
* This tweak won’t change the “Frequently Used” header in the Emoji selector, so although it still retains its old title, don’t be fooled; it will show the Emojis you’ve chosen as favorites rather than those iOS has been recommending based on your usage.
* The benefit here is that you can choose your own favorite Emojis rather than letting iOS tell you the ones you use the most often. It can help you route shortcuts to the Emojis you find more difficult to get to because they require more scrolling through the Emoji keyboard.
* Depending on how you use your device, this can be beneficial, especially for someone who does a lot of texting or instant messaging.
* Favorite Emojis adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* You should use the blue “Save Emoji List” button every time you make changes to the Emoji list. Once you do, you can hit the Respring button to make sure your keyboard accepts the changes you’ve made.
* If you find yourself using Emoijs more often than the average Joe, then you might want to give FavoriteEmojis a try. It’s available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $0.99 and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
