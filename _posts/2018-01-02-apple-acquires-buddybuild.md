* Apple has acquired Canadian startup Buddybuild, according to a blog post on the company’s website. The firm has developed a “continuous integration, continuous deployment, and user feedback platform for development teams,” and they will be joining the Xcode team at Apple.
* Here’s the post:
* We’re excited to share that the buddybuild team has joined the Xcode engineering group at Apple to build amazing developer tools for the entire iOS community.
* We’ve always been proud to be a Canadian company, so we’re also pleased that we will be staying right here in Vancouver — a hotbed of developer and engineering talent.
* The team also notes that it will no longer be accepting new customers, and Free Starter plans and Android app development will be discontinued on March 1 of this year. The Buddybuild service will remain available, however, to existing customers to build, test, and ship iOS apps to testers.
