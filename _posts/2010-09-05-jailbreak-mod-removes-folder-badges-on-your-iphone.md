* Have you ever been annoyed by the badges showing on the folders of your iPhone? Personally, it never bugged me but Chpwn, the developer of No Folder Badges must think otherwise.
* No Folder Badges is a new tweak available in Cydia that does one single thing: removing the folder badges (ie. badges for available app updates, unread emails, etc…).
* After installing this mod, you will realize that all badges showing on your folders are gone. No Folder Badges doesn’t come with any icon, or special settings.
* It is available in Cydia for free. Just out of curiosity, is it something you think is useful?
