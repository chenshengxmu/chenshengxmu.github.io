title: Poll- will Apple launch Retina MacBook Air in 2014?

* After transitioning its MacBook Pros to high-resolution Retina screens, the ultra-portable MacBook Air – my favorite Apple notebook of all time – has remained hopelessly stuck in the past with that normal-resolution display. I don’t want to trade portability for power, but non-Retina computing just doesn’t cut it for me anymore, simple as that.
* I guess you could say I’m ready to upgrade to a Retina MacBook Pro, unless – unless Apple brings out a Retina Air at some point this year. Of course, it’s always easy to argue that a Retina-fied MacBook Air is going to remain wishful thinking until all the technological pieces have fallen in place. After all, aren’t Retina screens known as power and GPU hogs?
* Yes, but fourth-generation Intel Core processors have made some great strides in power efficiency and graphics performances, as evidenced by the mid-2013 MacBook Air refresh: these systems now rock up to twelve-hour battery on the 13.3-inch model, or nine hours for the 11.6-inch version.
* The bigger problem: Retina needs a powerful backlighting to push more light between those densely-packed pixels, in turn requiring a larger battery inside the Air’s already ultra-thin enclosure.
* Me, I’m willing to sacrifice battery performance and be back at six hours of runtime in exchange for that ultra-sharp Retina screen. Which brings me to my question of the day: is Apple going to give the MacBook Air a Retina treatment this year, do you think?
* Cast your vote now.
* Will Apple launch Retina MacBook Air in 2014?
* Canalys analyst Daniel Matte conjures up Apple could double the Air’s 1,366-by-762 pixels by using Retina iPad display sheets at 264ppi at a different size in order to create a 2,732-by-1,536 display.
* It turns out that an ~11.88” Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7” 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI.
* It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7” iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.
* This would also entail replacing the existing 11.6-inch MacBook Air model with a slightly bigger 11.88-inch one. Apple could even keep the actual dimensions of the notebook intact by shrinking the side bezels, like they’ve done with the iPad Air.

* I am not so sure about the Retina model reaching the current $99 entry-level Air pricing.
* On the other hand – and the company has done this with the Pros – Apple could keep the non-Retina $999 Air alongside a $200 or so pricier Retina one to preserve the pricing range.
* Daniel acknowledges as much:
* By utilizing its existing iPad display manufacturing and gradually replacing both MacBook Air models with just one Retina model, Apple would save a lot of money. OS X’s Retina scaling modes would also partially offset the lack of a 13.3” display option.
* As per usual, chime in with your thoughts and give us reasoning behind your vote in the comments below.
* Does a Retina screen make sense for the Air?
* And, would you pay a slight premium for an ultra-sharp screen on that ultra-portable Apple notebook?
* And while we’re at it, the more iPad Pro rumors I read about, the more I’m convinced Apple is working on a Retina MacBook Air. Folks are probably misinterpreting all that supply chain talk mentioning 12.9-inch Retina panels for an unspecified Apple device.
