* Following a limited invite-only launch last month, Dish’s Sling TV service is now available to everyone in the United States, the company announced Monday.
* In addition, the service has added AMC to the basic channel lineup so you’ll be able to watch Better Call Saul, Mad Men and Walking Dead, for example.
* You can sign up here.
* The over-the-top video service delivers your shows over the Internet. No long-term commitment or cable subscription is required whatsoever to enjoy content.
* After a free 7-day trial, Sling TV is priced at $20 per month for the basic channel. Available content includes live feeds from ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN, delivered in high-definition 1080p resolution and with Dolby surround sound.
* You can also use your Sling TV credentials to watch ESPN and ESPN2 on the WatchESPN mobile app. This is available at no additional cost to all customers who subscribe to the “Best of Live TV” core package.
* Access to ESPN3, ESPN’s live multi-screen sports network, via the WatchESPN mobile app is coming soon.
* Those who subscribe to the “Sports Extra” pack can also use WatchESPN to watch SEC Network, ESPNEWS, ESPNU and college sports live cut-in and highlights networks ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Bases Loaded and ESPN Goal Line.
* Sling TV is accessible via the web, on Mac and Windows PCs, and across a range of mobile devices including iOS/Android phones and tablets, Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, Google’s Nexus Player, Roku players, select smart TVs from LG and Samsung and Microsoft’s Xbox One console.
* Additional content packs are available for $5 per month each. Support for Sony’s PlayStation, Google’s Chromecast and possibly even the Apple TV is due at a later stage.
* The service collates all live sources under the On Now tab in the mini guide. Though ads cannot be skipped, some live streams such as Scripps’ Food Network can be paused, rewound and watched again after they’ve aired.
* Earlier in the month, Sling added the flagship Univision Network, bringing to its channel lineup UniMás, UDN (Univision Deportes Network), Galavisión, El Rey Network, Bandamax, De Película, De Película Clásico, Telehit, tlnovelas, FOROtv as well as Univision and UniMás broadcast stations nationwide.
