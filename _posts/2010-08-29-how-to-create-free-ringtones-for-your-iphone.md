title: How to Create Free Ringtones for Your iPhone
---
* You either love custom ringtones or you invariably loathe them. You can put me down in the latter category. Nevertheless there are many who love hearing a portion of their favorite jam when someone calls, or assigning certain songs that fit the personality of a specific contact in their address book. If you fit into the group that loves custom alerts, you’re in luck.

* Mashable outlines the procedure that allows you to create the custom ringtones for free through iTunes. The instructions are a bit lengthy so click here for the step by step directions. You might also want to check out a review of Audiko we wrote a while ago. It’s a  search engine for ringtones that also allows you to easily create ringtones using your own music tracks.
* Since the topic is being discussed, how do you feel about customized ringtones? Honestly I can’t think of any song I like enough to want to hear it anytime of the day through the horrid speaker quality that the iPhone offers. Even if I could think of a selection, having only 30 seconds of the tune played would irritate me the same way that being around someone who listens to only half of a song before they feel the need to switch it to another.
* Give this tutorial a try and let us know how it worked for you. After that let us know in the comment box if you prefer having a custom or stock ringtone on your iPhone.
