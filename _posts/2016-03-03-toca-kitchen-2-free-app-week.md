* Apple’s in-house editors have selected Toca Boca’s Toca Kitchen 2, the official sequel to the wildly popular Toca Kitchen, as a new Free App of the Week on the App Store. Retailing for $2.99, this universal app is now available at no charge for a week, until next Thursday, March 10, 2016.
* Released in December 2014, the game has a rating of four and a half starts based on nearly 700 App Store reviews.
* In Toca Kitchen 2, you will cook foods for new types of guests, with more tools to play with and new food combinations to test out.
* “Food’s fun for everyone with Toca Boca’s second go-round in the kitchen. Choose different characters and try to please their palettes by preparing fish, fruit, vegetables and more,” Apple’s editors wrote.
* “Deciding what to serve and whether to bake, boil, fry, chop, puree or season it—or all of the above—will keep young chefs happily cooking away.”

* Mix ingredients however you want, but don’t go overboard with that oven-baked fish head with fried leftovers and lettuce juice as your guests will have digestion problems.
* There are five different kitchen tools to choose from in In Toca Kitchen 2.
* Like before, you get to watch your guests’ hilarious reactions to your cooking, which may provide a hint as to their preferences. Other enhancements in Toca Kitchen 2 include new ingredients in the fridge, new characters to feed, stronger character reactions than before and a new juicer and oven.
