* Instagram has recently promised that its mobile app for iPhone and iPad will soon bring users the ability to upload photos and videos “of any size” to their Stories in order to avoid losing parts of an image or removing a person out of a group video.
* The company mentioned this much-needed enhancement in a post from last week announcing the ability to add animated GIF stickers into Stories with built-in GIPHY search support.
* “In the coming weeks, we’re  rolling out the ability to upload photos and videos of any size to your story so you never have to lose part of a photo or cut a friend out of a group video,” it said.

* This means that your square, portrait or landscape photos and videos will appears in their full size, with any extra room filled with a custom color gradient that matches the appearance of the media you’ve shared. Your followers will be able to pinch to zoom out and share the embedded photo or video in its original dimensions.
* Instagram for iOS is available for free from App Store.
