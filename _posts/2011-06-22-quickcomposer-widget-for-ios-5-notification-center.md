* Apple’s new firmware won’t be officially available for another few months, but that hasn’t stopped the jailbreak community from experimenting with the beta release. We’ve seen several iOS 5 Notification Center widgets over the last few weeks, but there’s always room for more.
* The latest jailbreak tweak to surface for the new iOS is called QuickComposer. The widget allows you to access the composition screen of different applications with a single tap…
* iPhoneItalia explains that QuickComposer stores 5 icons in the iOS Notification Center that open up to their respective apps. Email, SMS, Twitter, Notes and Reminder all get shortcuts in this innovative widget.
* The nice thing is that tapping each icon launches you into the application’s composition screen, saving the user an extra step or 2 when inspiration strikes. For instance, tapping the SMS icon launches you into the “new message” screen of the app and the same thing with Email and Twitter.
* I like the idea of quick access to apps like Reminder and Email, but I don’t ever use the Notes app. Hopefully by the time this widget is ready to go there will be support for other applications like BiteSMS and Evernote.
* iPhoneItalia has QuickComposer slated to release shortly after iOS 5 officially launches. Some developers haven’t been too keen on releasing anything iOS 5-related until the NDA is lifted when the final version is made available to the public this fall.
* What do you think of QuickComposer?
