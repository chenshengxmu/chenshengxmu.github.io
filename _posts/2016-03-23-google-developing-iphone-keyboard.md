* Internet giant Google is developing a software keyboard for the iPhone which incorporates gesture-based typing, built-in GIF search and a variety of other search options, according to The Verge.
* “The keyboard, which has been in circulation among employees for months, is designed to boost the number of Google searches on iOS,” as per the report.
* As for search features, tapping the Google logo lets you run a search query through Google, with dedicated buttons for pictures and GIF searches. It’s unclear from the report whether or not the keyboard incorporates voice search.
* Aside from built-in search features and gesture-based typing with predictive suggestions, the keyboard is said to sport a bunch of other unspecified features meant to distinguish it from the stock iOS keyboard.
* Putting Google’s powerful search engine in a keyboard sounds like an intriguing idea, wouldn’t you say so?
