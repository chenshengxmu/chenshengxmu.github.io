* Apple’s competitors have adopted a wait-and-see approach, pushing back smartphone chip orders as they’re waiting to see the OLED-based iPhone 8 before making future plans.
* According to a report Monday from DigiTimes citing supply chain sources, competitors believe iPhone 8 will “come with revolutionary features”.
* According to the report, Apple’s supply chain saw iPhone chip orders pick up in June whereas demand for handset chips from rivals has been slow thus far. Suppliers don’t expect orders from Apple’s rivals to rise substantially until the fourth quarter of this year.
* Fabless semiconductor makers MediaTek and HiSilicon warned about “disappointing” chip shipments from Apple’s rivals. At the same time, customers of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are said to be more interested in the foundry’s 12-nanometer process technology than its cutting-edge ten-nanometer process.
* A recent report alleged that iPhone 8’s in-house designed A11 chip would be built using TSMC’s ten-nanometer technology.
