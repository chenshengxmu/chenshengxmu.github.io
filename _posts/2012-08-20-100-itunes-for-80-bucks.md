* Those looking for a good deal on an Apple-related back to school present will be happy to hear that Walmart is selling its iTunes eGift Cards at a fairly step discount.
* The retail giant is currently knocking $20 off of its digital iTunes gift cards worth $100, making them just $80. The cards cover anything from iBooks, to apps to music…
* The sale only applies to the $100 iTunes card option, and appears to only be available via email delivery. Walmart says this can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hrs.
* Keep in mind that the gift cards are non returnable, and non refundable. But with a new iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices coming next month, we don’t imagine it’ll go to waste.
* Obviously, this offer is only valid for a limited time.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
