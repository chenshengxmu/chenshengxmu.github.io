* The Tapbots on Friday issued an update for their popular iOS Twitter client Tweetbot 4, bringing the app to version 4.3. The update includes a number of improvements, and a brand new feature called Topics that promises to make tweetstorming easier.
* A Topic is a way to let you quickly Tweet a group of related Tweets without having to manually reply to yourself and/or add the same hashtags over and over. You can activate Topics by tapping the gear menu in the Compose screen, and they sync via iCloud.
* Here are the other improvements in 4.3:
* – You can now hide the extra side column on the iPad – Much better support for hardware keyboards, including using arrow keys to navigate the timeline – iPad images are no longer super huge – You can paste images when composing a Tweet, really useful when using GIF (with a hard G) keyboards – Support for Arabic language, including Right to Left UI – Muting a user you don’t follow will now also prevent Tweets from that user from showing up in your Mentions, Lists and Searches – Support for Twitter Collections – Quoting a Tweet looks much nicer when composing a Tweet – Support for Firefox browser – Improved support for uploading video to Twitter – Fixed an issue where timeline would get stuck
* Tweetbot 4 is available in the App Store, for both iPhone and iPad, for $9.99.
