* Like other companies, even Apple from time to time gets into motivation talk mode in order to get the best out of their employees. A year ago, they slipped a little note to their retails staff to remind them what’s so special about working in an Apple Store.
* Today, we get another insight into Apple’s morale-boosting practices.
* So, fancy yourself as a new Apple hire. It’s your first day on the job and your arrive at 1 Infinite Loop for work. Bursting with enthusiasm, you find the following note sitting on your desk…
* The note, courtesy of Instagram user “M” (via The New York Times columnist and lead writer Nick Bilton), reads:
* There’s work and there’s your life’s work.
* The kind of work that has your fingerprints all over it. The kind of work that you’d never compromise on. That you’d sacrifice a weekend for. You can do that kind of work at Apple. People don’t come here to play it safe. They come here to swim in the deep end.
* They want their work to add up to something.
* Something big. Something that couldn’t happen anywhere else.
* Welcome to Apple.
* And here’s the image.

* The message reminds me of this Steve Jobs quote:
* Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.
* I think the note conveys a clever message that helps new hires acclimatize to their new work environment while setting the right tone on their first day at work.
* Too bad I never got one of these.
* If I wanted to be cynical, I’d say the note also hints that employees are to work hard, but I’m positive this very mindset has actually helped Apple achieve great things over the years.
* What did you think of the note?
