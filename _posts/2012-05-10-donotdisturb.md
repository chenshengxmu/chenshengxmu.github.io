* Silencing annoying audible notifications and squashing banner alerts? There’s a jailbreak tweak for that.
* DoNotDisturb does exactly as its name implies — prevents Notification Center alerts from causing any disturbance.
* For a look at how it works in action, watch our full video walkthough…
* There are no settings to configure for DoNotDistrub, though you will need to enable the tweak via the Notifications panel in the Settings app. Once enabled, you’ll see a new toggle for DoNotDisturb in Notifictaion Center.
* Toggling the setting to on will prevent you from receiving alerts from Notification Center, though they will still be waiting for you the next time you open it.
* The nice thing about DoNotDisturb is that it’s totally dynamic; you can enable it and disable it with ease, and the setting takes effect immediately.
* If you want to give it a spin, head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo where you can download it for free.
* Seem like a good deal to you?
