* As we continue to wait for iOS 7.1 to be released to the public, Apple has seeded iOS 7.0.6 to the public this morning. The release comes a month after iOS 7.0.5 landed at the end of January, which also featured bug fixes for certain newer models of iPhones.
* It also looks like Apple has released a similar bug fix for iOS 6 users in iOS 6.1.6 Both updates are available either over the air, by visiting Settings > General > Software Update, or by plugging your device in iTunes. Or you can find them on our Download page…

* From the surface, it looks like iOS 7.0.6, which carries a build number of 11b651, just contains a fix for SSL connection verification. It is for all devices. And as for iOS 6.1.6, it carries a build number of 10b500, and is just for the iPhone 3GS and iPod touch 4G.
* We currently aren’t sure whether or not these updates are safe for jailbreakers, so it’s best to stay away from them until we get confirmation that they’re ok. We typically get word from the evad3rs or other prominent jailbreak figures within 24 hours of updates.
* Same advice as last time! Stay away from 7.0.6 if jailbroken, and we’ll update evasi0n7 if possible (this sounds like an important fix!)
