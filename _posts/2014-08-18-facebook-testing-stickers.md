* Hope you like stickers, Facebook users, because it looks like you’re going to start seeing a lot more of them on the social network. The company has been spotted testing the use of sticker graphics in post and page comments with select users.
* Stickers have become a popular element for a number of social networks and messaging services, but until now (and still for most people) they have only been available to Facebook users via mobile Messenger apps and Facebook Chat on the web…
* The Next Web has the report:
* Some Facebook users are now able to add stickers when posting comments on the social network. We contacted Facebook to learn more, and the company confirmed it is currently testing the new feature.
* “We are running a test which allows you to add a sticker to a comment on Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson told TNW. “Simply tap the sticker to add it to the comment, in the same way you would in Messenger.”
* Facebook often tests new features and services within a small subset of users—many of which never see the light of day. It sounds like the company is interested in rolling stickers out to everyone, though, provided it sees positive feedback here.
* Today’s news follows up some other recent major developments in Facebook’s world. Earlier this month, the company disabled the messaging feature in its main app, forcing users to use Messenger exclusively (although there is a workaround).
