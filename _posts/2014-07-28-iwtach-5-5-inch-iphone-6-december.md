* I don’t think anyone in their right mind would seriously question Apple’s motivation to reportedly market and sell bigger iPhones this year.
* Moreover, many pundits and watchers are in agreement that Apple will indeed enter new product categories this year with a rumored iWatch wearable device, said to combine health and fitness functions.
* What’s unclear though is the timing for these product launches. We already know it’s going to be action-packed Fall, but you’d be wise not to keep your fingers crossed for a simultaneous launch of both new iPhones and iWatches…
* A write-up by GforGames, based on a post on Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo [Google translate], suggests that we’re unlikely to see the Apple smartwatch or iPhablet before December.
* As a result, only a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 would apparently launch in September, with new iPads said to be coming the following month.
* The source suggests that the highly-anticipated iWatch will be released alongside the larger iPhone 6, so as of yet, it seems that the 4.7-inch model could be all by itself when the time comes to hit the stage
* The theory is supported by a pair of previously published rumors.

* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo speculated recently that Apple may have pushed mass production of the wrist-worn device back more than a month, into late-November. I myself opined that we may not see the rumored fitness/health device from Apple before Spring 2015.
* As for the 5.5-inch iPhone 6, Chinese media last week said the phablet-class device is slated to enter production in September alongside upcoming new iPads. The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 is said to have entered mass-production earlier this month.
* Further corroborating the claim that we won’t see a double-iPhone launch in September like last year: we have seen virtually nothing in terms of leaks specific to that device as all of the leaked parts and components seemingly belong to its 4.7-inch counterpart.
