* We’re about halfway through Cyber Monday and there are still plenty of deals going on, so as usual, we’ve decided to put together a list of our favorite discounts. There are many deals still going from Black Friday, as well as some new ones. Let’s just say that if you’re in the market for a consumer product, chances are it’s on sale somewhere today.
* If you don’t see what you’re looking for in the list above, be sure to check out Target, as they are taking 15% off of pretty much everything site-wide for the rest of the day. Also if you know of a significant deal we may have missed, be sure to share it with everyone down in the comments below! We’ll also be adding more discounts throughout the day.
