* Google chairman Eric Schmidt is in South Korea to help with the launch of Nexus 7 in the country. As always, the outspoken executive defended Google’s position on patents and addressed Apple’s legal victory in the high-profile patent infringement case against South Korea-based Samsung.
* Long story short, Schmidt is dissatisfied with Apple’s efforts to fight Android backers in the courtroom, insisting that companies should compete with products. Of course patent disputes are hurting consumer choice and preventing innovation, Schmidt underscored. According to one patent expert, Android has infringed upon a total of 17 valid Apple and Microsoft patents. Plus, don’t miss out on Schmidt dancing in Korea, Gangnam style…
* The Korea Times relays Schmidt’s statement during a launching event for the Nexus 7 tablet at the Grand Intercontinental Seoul:
* Literally patent wars prevent choice, prevent innovation and I think that is very bad. We are obviously working through that and trying to make sure we stay on the right side of these issues. So ultimately Google stands for innovation as opposed to patent wars.
* Patents in the mobile space are losing their purpose, he suggested:
* I think one of the worst things that happened in the last few years has been the belief that somehow there are so many patents in the mobile phone world, an estimated 200,000 that are overlapping and complicated and so forth, that one vendor can stop the sale of another vendor’s phones or devices.
* Google is friends with Apple…
* Apple is actually a very good partner. Our two companies are literally talking all the time about everything. With respect to Apple patents, the best thing we can tell there are plenty of prior arts and I don’t want to go beyond that.
* …and Samsung…
* I will be meeting with Samsung as well as with other important partners as I do every time I come here. With Samsung, as you can imagine, they are one of our most important partners and there is much to discuss.
* …and Korea…
* Your country has gone from having almost no smartphones three years ago; and it happened everywhere in just three years.
* The technology that can really change lives and people’s existence is happening now, and is within sight, and especially visible here in Korea.
* I like Korea because Korea represents the best mobile usage, and that is what I’ve been working on.
* …and even found time to loosen up a bit by dancing with Korean pop sensation Psy, per PCMag.
* No, seriously.
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-EWailoPoQ Patent blogger Florian Müeller updated his list of Apple and Microsoft patent infringements today. Müeller counted a total of eleven Apple and Microsoft patents Android had been found by a court to infringe, as of July 1.
* Today, that figure has increased to 17 valid Apple and Microsoft patents.
* Perhaps Schmidt is publicly derailing Apple’s legal right to defend its patented technology to divert attention away from the fact that Android has already been found of infringing other people’s patents?
