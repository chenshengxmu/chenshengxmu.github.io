* You know holidays are around the corner when greedy carriers start putting out promotions offering substantial savings and other perks if you jump ship. Announced on Tuesday, Sprint’s new promotion promises to cut your wireless bill in half if you switch to Sprint from AT&T or Verizon Wireless beginning Friday, December 5, for as long as you remain on the Sprint plan.
* Plus, Sprint will buy out your contract up to $350 per line. “You’ll get unlimited talk and text to anywhere in the U.S. and we’ll match your data,” the carrier teased. As an example, a Verizon customer paying $140 per month for four lines and ten gigs of data can get four lines and the same ten gigs of data on Sprint for $70 per month, or half the Verizon’s price.
* Jump past the fold for the full reveal and fine print.
* Here’s how it works:
* As stated above, you can visit a Sprint store and give them your current bill, too.
* Either way, you’ll need to turn in your old phone and then buy a new device from Sprint, either unsubsidized or through Sprint’s new leasing plans.
* For those on a contract with AT&T or Verizon, Sprint will generously pay your early termination fee up to $350 per line in the form of a Visa Prepaid Card or installment bill balance when you switch.
* Once you’ve received the final bill from your non-Sprint carrier, register for the Visa Prepaid Card at sprint.com/jointoday.
* Note that discount applies to base monthly service plan only and not to charges such as taxes, surcharges, add-ons, apps, premium content, international services, devices, partial charges or additional lines.
* The fine print cautions that other plans may receive prioritized bandwidth availability. “To improve data experience for the majority of users, throughput may be limited, varied or reduced on the network,” warns the carrier.
