* Those of you who enjoy app deals may be interested to know that Slow Shutter! has gone free for a limited time. Apple is currently offering promo codes for the popular camera app, which typically costs $1.99, within its Apple Store app.
* Slow Shutter’s flagship feature is its ability to capture long-exposure photographs. This means that you can create the kind of beautiful photos of moving objects (think moving cars at night) typically reserved for more expensive cameras.
* Apple describes the app:
* From waterfalls to night traffic, carousels to fireworks, capture long-exposure photographs with the Slow Shutter! app. With features usually reserved for pro-model cameras, you’ll capture amazing images in motion like never before, all from your iPhone.
* To grab your free copy, simply launch the Apple Store app (not to be confused with App Store), navigate to the ‘Stores’ tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page. If you see the ‘Start something new’ image, you may try swiping to the right.
* Note that these steps may differ a bit on iPad, and I’m not sure exactly which countries this promotion is available for outside of the United States. But Slow Shutter! is a solid app, especially for free, so it’s definitely worth looking into.
* You can find the Apple Store app in the App Store for free.
