* According to several news outlets, Apple has finally decided on who will manufacture the display panels for the iPad 3. If you’ve been following the rumors regarding Apple’s upcoming tablet, you’ll know why that’s such a big deal.
* With Apple in an ongoing court battle against Samsung, the company has turned to other manufacturers to fill the void. And after extensively testing displays from Sharp and LG, it sounds like it’s finally picked a replacement (or two)…
* DigiTimes reports this morning that LG will act as the leading panel supplier for the iPad 3. Sharp has also been tagged as a supplier, with a chance of overtaking Samsung to become 2nd chair.
* “Sharp stands a chance of overtaking the Korea competitor if it is able to run stable supplies of quality panels.”
* Apple’s move to distance themselves from Samsung isn’t the least bit surprising, considering the companies have been at each other’s throats since April. Apple is suing the Korean company for copying the look and feel of its tablets and smartphones.
* There’s no mention in the report of the upcoming tablet’s resolution. Recent speculation has suggested that the display will be Retina-capable, with a staggering 2048 x 1536 screen.
* Although several tech pundits have tried to debunk the rumor, you can’t deny that Apple is looking to dramatically improve the iPad’s display. The company has gotten away with the 1024 x 768 screen for two years now, I don’t see them trying for a third.
