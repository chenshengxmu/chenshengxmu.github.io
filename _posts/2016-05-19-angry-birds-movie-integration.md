* Rovio and Sony Pictures’ heavily promoted 3D animated comedy, “The Angry Birds Movie”, is hitting theaters tomorrow, Friday, May 20.
* Working closely with Sony, Rovio created an innovative integration that lets movie-goers unlock a special game level, Piggy Island, along with an exclusive clip simply by turning on the Angry Birds Action mobile game during the closing credits.
* “Movie Magic is where The Angry Birds Movie collides with Angry Birds Action,” said Rovio. “Unlock special levels and new content at the Angry Birds Movie just by bringing Angry Birds Action with you”.
* They do this by playing an inaudible digital watermark behind the end credits, which the game detects and unlocks bonus content accordingly.
* Here’s a video that shows how this “Movie Magic” works.
* Angry Birds Action is completely free to download on the App Store.
* They also prepared and printed more than a billion BirdCodes, located out in the real world, that can be scanned with the Angry Birds Action game to unlock additional power-ups and digital content.
* And here’s the latest theatrical trailer for “The Angry Birds Movie”.
* As you may have guessed, the movie takes place on the legendary paradise island, which is  almost entirely populated by happy, flightless birds—with a few exceptions: Red (Jason Sudeikis), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad) and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride) have always been outsiders.
* “When the island is visited by mysterious green piggies, it’s up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to,” reads the blurb.
* “The Angry Birds Movie” is opening in theaters across China, the United States and other territories on May 20. So there you go, you are officially encouraged to break a few rules this weekend, and turn on your iPhone in your movie seats.
