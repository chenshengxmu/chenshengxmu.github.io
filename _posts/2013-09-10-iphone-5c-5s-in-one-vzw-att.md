* As we continue to uncover interesting tidbits following Apple’s introduction of the flagship iPhone 5s and the plastic iPhone 5c this morning, a little-appreciated fact has now come to light. Both new iPhones are offered in four different hardware varieties each versus three different cellular versions of the iPhone 5.
* The consolidated 5s/5c models offer more LTE bands than before, but the coolest thing is that in the United States a single version now supports AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. Additionally, a different version of the handsets will provide compatibility with Sprint and Japan’s KDDI and Softbank carriers.
* Previously, there used to be two different US flavors of the iPhone 5, one for the AT&T and T-Mobile and the other for Verizon and Sprint networks…
* Thanks to the expanded LTE support, a single variety of both new iPhones will provide compatibility with Vodafone’s new LTE network, EE’s network and Three’s upcoming LTE network which launches in December, MacRumors explains.
* Despite keeping mum on the rumored deal with China Mobile, the world’s largest telco, it’s interesting that China is among the countries included in the first wave of iPhone 5s/5c launches on Friday, September 20.
* Previously, iPhones would become available in the 1.33 billion people market a few months after they launched in the United States.
* UnwiredView reports that China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has recently issued the 4G TD-LTE certification for the flagship iPhone 5s.
* Given the telco is prepping the commercial launch of the TD-LTE 4G network later this year, the iPhone 5s should be among a few devices offered initially. Thus far, China Mobile announced the following TD-LTE devices: the Samsung Galaxy Note II ,  Sony Xperia SP, Huawei Ascend D2 and  ZTE Grand Memo U-815.

* The iPhone 5s/5c feature more LTE coverage than ever before, Apple states:
* iPhone 5s has up to 13 LTE bands. That’s more than any other single model of smartphone. Which means even more iPhone users can experience fast download and upload speeds in more places around the world.
* Meanwhile, the number of LTE carriers supported by iPhone worldwide continues to grow. So when you’re traveling, you can take advantage of ultrafast LTE networks in more places.
* The iPhone 5s specs page lists four models, the A1533, A1453, A1457 and A1530.
* Here’s a detailed overview of each one:
* The iPhone 5c specs page lists these four versions: A1532, A1456, A1507 and A1529.
* Check them out below:
* As you know, Apple used to offer three different version of the iPhone 5: model A1428 for GSM networks (AT&T), model A1429 with both GSM and CDMA support  (Verizon, Sprint and other CDMA carriers) and another model, A1442, for China’s CDMA telcos.
* If you hop over to Apple’s web page that identifies iPhone models, you’ll notice it’s not been updated with the newly announced iPhone 5s/5c hardware yet. Apple provides additional details on LTE support here.
* On a related note, the company confirmed in a press release today that both new iPhones will launch on Japan’s NTT DoCoMo carrier on Friday, September 20.
* Beginning on Friday, September 13, NTT’s customers can pre-order the iPhone 5c at the carrier’s dealers. The first 30,000 DoCoMo Premier Club Premier Stage customers can pre-order the device from the carrier’s website.
* The iPhone hasn’t been available on the NTT DoCoMo network before so the carrier’s 60+ million customers should provide a nice boost to iPhone sales in the country.
