* Legendary file management app, iFile, is now available with several notable updates in tow. Most importantly, the Finder-like tool for iOS has been updated for iOS 8. Secondly, support has been added for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* iFile is one of the most important apps that you can download on Cydia. It brings true file management to iOS, something that just isn’t possible with native App Store apps. Have a look inside for the full change log and more iFile love.

* iFile on the iPhone 6 Plus
* 2.1.0-1 – Feature and Bugfix Release:
* Enhancements
* Fixes
* I use iFile every day to manage iOS’ native file system, install .deb files that I receive from developers, rename files, unzip files, etc. It’s truly like having access to the OS X Finder on iOS, and it’s one of my top 10 apps of all time, Cydia Store or otherwise.
* If you’re looking for a way to manage files on iOS, there simply is no better tool in my opinion. And you don’t have to take my word for it, iFile comes with a free trial so that you can test it out to see whether or not it’s for you.
* If you’ve already purchased iFile, the update is absolutely free. Otherwise, after the free trial, it’s $3.99.
* Are you an iFile believer?
