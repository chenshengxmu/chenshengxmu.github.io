title: I Guess Geohot is Not Working on an Untethered Jailbreak After All
---
* It seems that I missed a tweet by Gehot a few weeks ago in which he made it clear that he was not going to work on an untethered version of BlackRa1n.

* I don’t know if you remember but Geohot said a few weeks ago that he would give us an untethered jailbreak if he won some kind of contest. Well he lost! And we all lose too!
* I don’t know how I feel about that. I mean, the kid is completely in his right to not develop an untethered jailbreak. But somehow, I feel like when you have such a great gift as he has, you kinda have a responsibility towards the community.
* Again, he’s free to do whatever he wants but I think it’s very childish to say “I”l give you what you want IF I win this stupid contest” and have us hold our breath. Then of course we’re all disappointed when we realize that he lost the contest and he’s not going to give us what we want.
* One thing is sure: the Dev Team will not let us down. The Dev Team will not play game with us and they will not have us wait and hope in vain. As I said in an article a few weeks ago, I believe the Dev Team is up to something and might very well surprise us.
* What do you think about how Geohot is acting?
