---
* Electronic Arts today in North America released Need for Speed: Most Wanted on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360 consoles, as well as on Windows PCs and Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android mobile platforms. The game is available now for seven bucks both over at the App Store and Play Store. Need for Speed: Most Wanted rolls out in Australia on November 1 and in Europe the following day.
* A version for Nintendo’s new Wii U console is slated to hit North American shores, Europe and Australia some time next year. The game invites you to drive “the world’s hottest cars ripping through the open world, screwing with the cops and get away in style”. In addition to the above launch trailer, I’ve also included several nice videos below the fold…
* By the way, the universal binary for the iPhone and iPad is a 593MB download versus just twelve megabytes for an Android version.
* From YouTube description:
* Buckle up, hit the gas and hold on tight; you’re in for the ride of your life. In Most Wanted, you’ll experience dream cars, the way you always wanted them. No tracks and no simulation. It’s about taking your ride to the limit and beyond, nailing perfect 200 mile-an-hour drifts, slamming your friends off the road, outsmarting the cops and getting away with it in style.
* Developed by Firemonkeys, Need for Speed: Most Wanted boasts dynamic physics-based collisions for realistic visual damage. A lot of emphasis is on cop takedowns and high speed chases, as seen in these trailers.
* There are 35 different cars to choose from, like the Dodge Challenger SRT8 392, the Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale, Porsche 911 Carrera S, SRT Viper GTS, Hummer H1 Alpha, plus unlockable ones.
* Check out this IGN clip showcasing iOS gameplay.
* And here’s console gameplay.
* And your multiplayer trailer.
* The launch trailer is also nice.
* And this here is one totally dope live action TV commercial.
* Will you be taking the plunge?
