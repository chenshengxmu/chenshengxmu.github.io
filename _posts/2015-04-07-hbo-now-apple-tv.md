* As previously announced at Apple’s March 9 media event, HBO’s online-only subscription services has just launched on Apple’s $69 set-top box, the iPhone, iPad and on the web ahead of the series premiere of its hit show Game of Thrones on April 12.
* The video subscription service will be available exclusively on the Apple TV and the iOS platform for a limited time. A free 30-day trial is available if you sign up in April, after which watching HBO NOW will set you back $14.99 each month.
* Don’t confuse HBO NOW to HBO Go, a complimentary service which lets cable subscribers that have HBO in their package stream shows to their mobile devices at no additional cost.
* HBO NOW is available via a new Home screen icon on the Apple TV, on the iPhone and iPad via the official iOS application, which will be launching on the App Store later today, and on the web at hbonow.com.
* You can subscribe to the service right from your Apple TV or iOS device using iTunes billing, with no long-term contract or commitment. Upon completing registration, most of your dealings with HBO NOW applications, even across different devices, will only require your HBO NOW user name and password.
* HBO NOW offers instant access to every episode of every season of HBO’s award-winning original programming as well as the latest Hollywood hit movies, documentaries, sports and exclusive comedy specials.

* If you don’t have an Apple device to sign up for a subscription, you must get one through a participating provider at a later stage, though there may not be a provider that covers your area. After signing up for the service, you’ll be able to stream shows to your desktop via the hbonow.com website.
* Some people are reporting problems signing up for the service.
* We’re off to a tremendous start. HBO Now account signup just failed right at the end. Very user-friendly error. pic.twitter.com/ZZLj5owqdZ

* You can add any video to your Watch list and access it on any device, manage cellular usage in mobile apps (or limit playback to Wi-Fi connections), use AirPlay to beam video from an iOS device to your Apple TV, tap into parental controls to limit access, continue watching on one device and pick up right where you left off on any other (check out Continue Watching in your Watchlist) and more.

* Keep in mind that HBO NOW is initially only available to folks in the United States and certain U.S. territories.
* Again, HBO NOW is an online-only video-on-demand service so no cable or satellite subscription is required. As part of its exclusivity window with Apple, HBO NOW will be limited to Apple devices and Optimum Online for the next three months.
