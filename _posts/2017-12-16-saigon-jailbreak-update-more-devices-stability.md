* Abraham Masri has updated his iOS 10.2.1 Saïgon jailbreak, incorporating Siguza’s new v0rtex exploit. Using the same vulnerability as Ian Beer’s exploit for iOS 11, v0rtex for iOS 10 has replaced ziVA as the kernel magic behind the Saïgon jailbreak. This change has brought greater stability to Saïgon, which was previously very finicky to successfully run.
* The update, beta 3, also brings support to more devices, though still on a limited range of firmwares. Here is the new supported device list:
* It is to be hoped that the remainder of the 64-bit devices gain support soon. v0rtex technically works all the way up to iOS 10.3.3, and on all devices up to the iPhone 7(+). However, there is more to be done before they can get a full jailbreak. Expect to see pre-iPhone 7 devices get support on iOS 10.2.1 first, then on iOS 10.3.x. Support for 32-bit devices may come next, from tihmstar. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support will likely be last, as their newer hardware protections will need an additional exploit which is currently missing, or else an entirely re-written Cydia Substrate.
* Here is the full changelog for Saïgon beta 3:
* To update from an earlier beta, simply delete the old Saïgon app, reboot your device, sideload the new beta .ipa with Cydia Impactor, and re-jailbreak. Expect it to take far fewer tries than it used to!

* As you can see from the image above, I’ve recently tested the new beta on an iPhone 5s on iOS 10.2.1. It works perfectly, with the jailbreak process working first try each time I have tried it so far.
* Let me know your experiences with Saïgon, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask them below!
