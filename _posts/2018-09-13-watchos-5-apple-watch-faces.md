title: Apple adds new Fire, Vapor, Water and Liquid Metal faces to Apple Watch
---
* Soon after the completion of its “Gather round” event, Apple released the GM version of watchOS 5. The new update for Apple Watch revealed four of the new watch faces that the company revealed during the Apple Watch Series 4 presentation. That’s right, these new watch faces are also coming to older Apple Watches, albeit with one important caveat.
* First, here are the watch faces:

* All of these watch faces are fully functional and move as you turn your wrists. On the Apple Watch Series 4, these watch faces will take up the entire screen. As you can see above, on the current models, the action is limited to a circle in the middle of the screen.
* Apple’s expected to release watchOS 5 to the general public on Monday, Sept. 17. You can pre-order the Apple Watch Series 4 beginning tomorrow, Sept. 14.
