* We’ve heard the reports from “insider sources,” and we’ve seen the leaked parts. But just in case you had any doubts that Apple was on the verge of releasing a new iPhone, check this out.
* A handset, believed to be one of Apple’s next smartphones, has been spotted pinging a developer’s server logs. Codenamed iPhone 5,2, this could be a sign that a release is imminent…
* TechCrunch reports:
* “A few short days after rumors began swirling that Apple would hold this year’s fall event on Sept. 12, a reliable source just sent a screen grab of a next-gen iPhone popping up in his/her/its server logs.”
* The report goes on to say that it’s not known whether this, the iPhone 5,2, the iPhone 5,1, or both are in production. It’s possible that this model is just an internal test unit.
* TechCrunch is believed to be fairly reputable when it comes to Apple rumors. The site played a part in the talk regarding the iOS 6 Maps makeover leading up to WWDC, as well as the rumored switch to a smaller dock connector in the next iPhone.
* At any rate, it’s not hard to believe that folks inside Apple are testing the next iPhone against the web, apps, and other sources. The September 12 media event, in which Apple is widely expected to unveil the new handset, is just a little over a month away.
