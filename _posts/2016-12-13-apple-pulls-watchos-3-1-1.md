* Apple on Tuesday pulled watchOS 3.1.1, following complaints that the software is bricking some Series 2 Watch models. The update, which was released yesterday, includes support for new Unicode 9.0 emoji, some customization features, and more.
* According to the complaints, after installing watchOS 3.1.1, affected Apple Watches begin displaying a red exclamation point and the URL www.apple.com/help/watch. A force restart does not fix the issue, and these Watches will likely need servicing.
* No one on the iDB team has experienced a bricked device after updating to watchOS 3.1.1, but we can confirm that Apple has pulled the software and is showing watchOS 3.1 to be the latest version. We’ll be sure to pass along any new info we receive.
* For the time being, if for some reason you’re still seeing 3.1.1, do not install it. And if you’re one of the unlucky users whose Watch was bricked by the update, it seems like visiting your local Apple Store is your best (and likely only) option right now.
