* As the title suggests, the iDownloadBlog Wallpapers of the Week collection is refreshed each week, on Sundays. Ranging from pop culture to space images, the wallpaper collection has been growing for a couple years. One of the most commonly popular post-categories is geometric shapes.
* Take a step below to download a new collection of geometrically based images for iPhone and iPad.
* The Wallpapers of the Week section is populated by images found around the Internet or submitted directly to me via Twitter @jim_gresham. Catch up with me to show off your favorite images or original works! Alternately, just follow along for more images during the week.
* Our collection below is shared via papers.co, which hosts wallpapers for many device types.
