* As it did last year, Apple debuted new cases alongside its new iPhone models today. They come in both silicon and leather, various colors, and two sizes to fit either the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 or the larger 5.5-inch iPhone Plus.
* The leather cases are very similar to the ones we saw for the iPhone 5s last year. Apple says they use ‘premium’ leather, for a ‘luxurious’ feel, and each case is lined with microfiber to prevent scratching and keep things snug.
* The new silicone cases are made to custom-fit the new iPhone models, fitting snugly over Volume and Power buttons, as well as the new curved corners. The outside feels like silk, and again we have microfiber lining the inside.

* The leather cases come in Black, Brown, Blue, Pink and Product (RED), and are priced at $45 and $49 for each iPhone model, respectively. The silicon cases come in similar colors, and are priced at $35 and $39 respectively.
* Apple doesn’t give an availability date for the cases, but we’re assuming they’ll launch alongside the iPhone 6 next week.
