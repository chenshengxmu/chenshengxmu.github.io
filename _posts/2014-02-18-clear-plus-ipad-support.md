* Realmac Software has finally added native iPad support to its popular Clear to-do application for the iPhone and iPod touch. They’re also moving customers from Clear+ back to Clear for free.
* These changes are in response to user confusion amid complaints from people who were uncertain which version to buy, with some even mistakenly buying the iPhone edition when they really wanted the universal version that natively supports all form-factor iDevices.
* Clear for iPhone with the newly added iPad support is now available in the App Store for $4.99. Clear+ remains a separate $4.99 download, though it’s going to be offered free of charge for a limited time to allow Clear+ owners to migrate to Clear without being forced to buy the app twice…
* In its letter to customers titled ‘Making Things Right,’ Realmac explains that they’ll be making Clear free for the next 24 hours so owners of Clear+ can move to the correct version free of charge.
* “To make sure as many people as possible can move to Clear, we’re going to do this twice in the next few weeks,” the company wrote. The unusual move is necessary because Apple doesn’t offer a way to migrate users between copies of an app.
* You will need to sign up here to get notified by email when Clear goes free.
* “Remember we’ve never made Clear free before, and we’re only going to do it twice,” cautions the post. The team also confirmed they’ll be launching a free update to Clear featuring reminders support, with “much more in store for you in the coming months”.
* A lot of people complained after Realmac last September released a new version of Clear called Clear+, effectively a paid upgrade with iOS 7 UI and native support for the iPhone and iPad.
* But the team made a mistake in removing the original version of Clear from the App Store because users complained about being charged for an update as Realmac stopped updating the old version of Clear.
* Following backlash, the team then updated the old version of Clear for iOS 7 and put it back on the App Store.
* Confused?
* You’re not alone.
* Get the universal Clear app in the App Store for $4.99.
* Clear+, also universal, is available for an additional $4.99.
* Both Clear editions require iOS 7.0 or later.
* If you love Clear’s UI, make sure to check out Peek, a nice iPhone calendar app that’s heavy on gestures and easy on the eyes.
