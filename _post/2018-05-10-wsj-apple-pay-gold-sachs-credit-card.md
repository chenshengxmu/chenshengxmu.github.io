* Apple is planning to launch a branded Apple Pay credit card as soon as early 2019.
* The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday of Apple’s alleged partnership with investment banking firm Goldman Sachs that’d see a joint “Apple Pay” card replace the current Apple Rewards card (a partnership between Apple and Barclays BCS, already works with Apple Pay).
* “Apple and Goldman are still hashing out the terms and benefits of the planned card including the perks for customers,” reads the report.
* The report implies that this is simply a rebranding effort on Apple’s part to consolidate its mobile payment service and joint credit cards under the umbrella term “Apple Pay”. It’s unclear if this new Apple Pay-Branded card would work with the peer-to-peer payment service Apple Pay Cash, which currently uses Green Dot Bank and Discover.
* The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Apple was working with Goldman on a cheaper financing deal to consumers buying phones, watches and other devices.
* “The partnership will extend into other services including Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers buying iPhones and other gadgets,” today’s report added.
