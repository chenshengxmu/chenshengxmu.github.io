* Apple is currently working on a headset with dual 8K displays that will be capable of both virtual and augmented reality, reports CNET. The outlet says the device, codenamed T288, is wireless—meaning it doesn’t require a tether to a Mac or iPhone—and it’s slated to launch in 2020.
* Apple’s headset would connect to a dedicated box using a high-speed, short-range wireless technology, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. The box, which would be powered by a custom Apple processor more powerful than anything currently available, would act as the brain for the AR/VR headset. In its current state, the box resembles a PC tower, but it won’t be an actual Mac computer.
* And unlike with the HTC Vive, users wouldn’t have to install special cameras in a room to detect their location. Everything would be built into Apple’s headset and box, the person said.
* Rumors regarding Apple building a VR/AR headset have been bouncing around for years. CEO Tim Cook is a well-known proponent of augmented reality, and the company has several patents and high profile hires in the filed. It’s also acquired a number of startups with AR/VR tech.
