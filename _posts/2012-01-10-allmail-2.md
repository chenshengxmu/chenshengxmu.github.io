* AllMail is a jailbreak tweak that adds a variety of “mass edit” options to the stock Mail app. For instance, you can select all, delete all, and even hide all emails in one swift motion.
* Although iOS 5 has brought some improvements to the Mail app, it’s still a lot better when accompanied by jailbreak tweaks like AllMail and others…
* We previously looked at AllMail when it was initially released, but it was brought to our attention that we had never created a video walkthrough of the tweak in action.
* I have to say that while my experience was generally good, I did notice a few crashes here and there when using the hide mail option. Your mileage may vary.
* If interested, AllMail can be purchased on Cydia for $1.50. Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
