* If the evidence stacking up wasn’t enough to convince you the new iPad will be available for sale on Friday, at 8am, maybe this official announcement from Apple will.
* In a press release sent earlier today, Apple confirmed that the new iPad will be available in the US and nine additional countries, on Friday at 8am…
* Apple® today announced the new iPad®, the third generation of its category defining mobile device, will arrive at Apple’s retail stores and the Apple Online Store (www.apple.com) on Friday, March 16 at 8:00 a.m. local time in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and the UK; along with Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
* Of course, you can still pre-order, but you won’t receive your iPad anytime soon. All in all, if you haven’t already pre-ordered, getting in line at 8am this Friday is your best bet to get your hands on the new iPad.
