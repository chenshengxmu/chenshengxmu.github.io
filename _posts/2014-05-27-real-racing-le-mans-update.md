* I don’t think people give Electronic Arts and Firemonkeys the credit they deserve for relentlessly updating free-to-play Real Racing 3, one of the finest racing titles available in the App Store.
* Following its February 2013 debut, the freemium game has thus far received at least a dozen content updates, each of which is a winner in its own right. For example, in mid-April it’s brought us open-wheel vehicles and other treats.
* Today’s ‘Le Mans’ update puts you behind the wheel of the Le Mans Prototypes – the ultimate endurance racing cars. It also includes the eagerly-awaited night racing mode on the classic Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans, the ability to link up to four devices via Bluetooth for an immersive split-screen multiplayer and much more…
* Check out the trailer, featuring the new Le Mans track.
* In addition to the aforementioned goodies and a host of multiplayer improvements, you can now enjoy an all-new four player split-screen Party Play racing mode.
* After earning your own free Porsche 919 Hybrid at Le Mans, race in the Time Trial competition to win a trip to a Porsche Sport Driving School! Then kick back with friends for big screen multiplayer fun in Party Play mode.
* This game just keeps getting better and better – my only wish is they let me add body kits and spoilers.
* Speaking of which, this update is prompting me to think that I’d really die to see an official F1 Real Racing game from Electronic Arts and Firemonkeys.
* Anyways, features included in this 2.3.0 update include:
* • Next Generation Le Mans Prototypes – Porsche’s 919 Hybrid, Audi’s R18 e-tron Quattro, Toyota’s TS040 Hybrid. • An Epic Le Mans Campaign – Pursue victory in this unique series of challenges and goals. • Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans – Race on the world’s foremost endurance racing circuit, watching the sun go down and the night set in. • Party Play – Connect Bluetooth controllers and race with up to 4 friends in local split-screen multiplayer, perfect for the big screen! • Porsche Time Trial Competition – Race your Porsche 919 Hybrid to win a trip to a Porsche Sport Driving School! • Real-Time Multiplayer Improvements – Penalties for cutting corners, better results calculations, improved latency handling, and more!
* Download Real Racing 3 free of charge in the App Store.
* The massive 1.29GB download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad device capable of supporting iOS 5.1.1 or later.
