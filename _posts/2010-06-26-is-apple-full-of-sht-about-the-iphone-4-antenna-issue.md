title: Is Apple Full of Sh*t About the iPhone 4 Antenna Issue?

* Are you familiar with the iPhone 4 antenna death grip? Basically, when held with the left hand, connecting the two antennas, the signal drops significantly, often cutting off cell signal. It’s a big deal as many people reported experiencing this issue, me included.
* Someone has been emailing Steve Jobs about this issue, who sent the most moronic email reply of all times:
* If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4, avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available cases.
* Ok, so you’re telling me to hold my iPhone a different way, or, to buy one of your cases? Seriously, is that your official statement? Anyways.
* Now there are rumors that Apple might come up with a software upgrade to fix this issue. So why did Steve Jobs sent this moronic reply if it can be fixed with a software update?
* As Mongstradamus pointed out to me, someone needs to call out Apple on this. Steve’s email clearly makes it seem like it’s a hardware issue and a software update wouldn’t change a thing.
* Is it just me being too skeptical? What do you think?
