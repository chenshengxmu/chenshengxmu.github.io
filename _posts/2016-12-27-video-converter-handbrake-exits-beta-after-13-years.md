* In a better-late-than-never move, the free cross-platform video converter Handbrake has finally hit version 1.0. The app had been languishing in beta for more than thirteen years. Handbrake 1.0, a free download for Mac, Windows, Ubuntu and other platforms, lets you convert videos easily from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. With subtitle support, capable transcoding engine and built-in presets for devices like Apple TV, iPhone and iPad, Handbrake makes it easy to optimize videos for your specific hardware.
* It’s something of an irony that Handbrake has finally exited beta at a time of the demise of optical media, especially as Macs no longer feature built-in DVD drives. That doesn’t mean Handbrake is useless—quite the contrary, it’s one of the best cross-platform, open-source video transcoders available on the market at absolutely no charge.

* Because developers are currently unable to sign the HandBrake downloads, macOS will flag the app as from an unidentified developer. To work around this, change your Gatekeeper settings to allow apps from unidentified developers, or right-click the app, then selects Open from the popup menu.
* Some of the Mac-specific improvements in Handbrake 1.0 include:

* Please be advised that downloads are not mirrored on any third-party services, excepting the Linux PPA, so be sure to grab your copy of the app from the only official source for HandBrake. To get the most from the app, check out the new English-only online HandBrake Documentation beta.
