* Apple’s infinitely popular AirPods have changed the way we listen to music for the better. And, while the earphones boast amazing quality, not all of us are keen on transporting them in the same generic white case. This Leather AirPod Case offers a convenient and more stylish way to store and transport your AirPods, and it’s on sale for 10% off at $17.99.
* Made from high-quality, European leather that’s hand-stretched over a rigid frame, this case protects your AirPods from drops, dirt, and dust. You’ll enjoy easy access to the case’s Lightning port, and a super secure fit means that you won’t have to worry about your AirPods rattling around in your bag.
* Carry your AirPods in style with a Leather AirPod Case, available in different colors/styles for just $17.99—10% off its usual price.
