* The iPad Air 2 is about the size of a pad of lined paper, so it is no wonder that a folio case looks so good on it. If you are looking for more than just a cover with a stand, Snugg makes an executive smart folio that has all of the bells and whistles you’d want in your case. Plus, with the leather exterior, you’ll look like a boss at all of your business meetings.
* The case fits snuggly (intentional pun) around the iPad Air 2 leaving the front-facing camera and Home button exposed. All ports and buttons along the side of the device are also left open, so you wont have trouble accessing them. There is a hole on the backside of the case so you can take pictures with your iPad Air 2. However, when the folio is flipped over, it does cover the camera.

* The inside of the folio cover has three slots that fit average sized credit cards, business cards, and IDs. There is an additional hidden pocket that is large enough to fit your passport, cash, and other important items. There is a penholder loop attached to the top of the case so you can secure a stylus.
* The folio cover also doubles as a stand that works in two positions. Set your iPad upright for watching movies, or lay it flat for the ideal typing angle.
* There is an elastic strap on the inside of the folio cover that you can slip your hand into and hold your iPad more securely. The case has magnetic sections that trigger the iPad Air 2’s Sleep/Wake functions.
* Snugg’s iPad Air 2 smart folio is available in a variety of colors on Amazon for $40.
