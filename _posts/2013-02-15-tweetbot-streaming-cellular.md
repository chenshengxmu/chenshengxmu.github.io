* Tweetbot, my favorite Twitter client by a country mile, takes well advantage of Twitter’s streaming API for instant timeline updates with no manual refresh. It works very well, but unfortunately Tweetbot requires you to be connected to Wi-Fi in order to use the feature. What to do now? Fake a Wi-Fi connection, of course!
* 3G Unrestrictor has many uses, and one such use is to enable Twitter streaming in Tweetbot over a cellular connection. Check out our brief video inside.
* Step 1: Install 3G Unrestrictor 5 from Cydia (Direct Cydia Download).
* Step 2: Open 3G Unrestrictor and add Tweetbot.
* Step 3: Restart Tweetbot, and make sure Streaming is enabled in the Tweetbot settings.
* It’s that simple, and comes in handy while you’re away from home. Hope that helps.
