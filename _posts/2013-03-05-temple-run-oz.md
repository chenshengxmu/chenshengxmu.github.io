title: Temple Run- Oz slides its way into App Store ahead of Fridays flick release
---
* Imangi Studios, the brains behind the popular endless-runner game Temple Run, is no stranger to movie tie-ins. Just last June, they released Temple Run: Brave which uses content from Disney’s Pixar animated feature film, ‘Brave’. A much-improved sequel to Temple Run hit the App Store in January 2013, quickly becoming the fastest downloaded mobile game in history.
* Today Imangi’s second Hollywood tie-in is available for download as a universal build for iPhones and iPads. As the name suggests, Temple Run: Oz ties nicely with ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’, an upcoming fantasy adventure film directed by Sam Raimi and due to hit theaters this coming Friday, March 8…
* A collaborative publishing effort between Imangi Studios and Disney, Temple Run: Oz follows the proven formula, inviting you to run, jump and slide along the Yellow Brick Road.
* Unlike Temple Run: Brave which was based on the original Temple Run engine, Temple Run: Oz runs on the improved engine which powers that fast and fluid performance in Temple Run 2.
* As you’d expect, the lush environments follow the flick’s theme and change as you run, with the game’s settings and characters also borrowing heavily from Disney’s upcoming flick.
* Promotional App Store screenies look quite nice.

* It’s not just about the movie, though: Temple Run: Oz features an all-new hot-air balloon section that has nothing to do with the flick.
* From TouchArcade‘s review:
* Temple Run: Oz also looks to add its own personal touch with a hot-air balloon flying segment, which is really just a tilt-based coin collect-a-thon but breaks up the action and has a cool epic feel.
* There are also dynamic hazards you need to be careful of, like a crumbling statue that will block your path or an enemy that swoops in from the sky that you’ll need to quickly duck under.
* Here’s that hot-air balloon segment.

* As both ‘Brave’ and ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ are Disney flicks, it’s likely that Imangi has negotiated a long-term deal with the Mickey Mouse hose. Disney is also clever to rely on the hugely popular mobile game franchise such as Temple Run rather than risk a flop by making its own game.
* This is apparently becoming a trend in the movie and game publishing business. Angry Birds maker Rovio, for example, recently released a Star Wars-themed pinball game.
* Here’s TouchArcade’s hands-on video.
* Temple Run: Oz costs 99 cents over at the App Store and will be available on Android devices over at Google’s Play Store later.
* Parents beware, Temple Run: Oz lures gamers with a bunch of in-app purchasable upgrades. Even though this seems to be the norm these days, I loathe the practice for Temple Run: Oz is a paid download rather than a free-to-play title, after all.
* Anyways, if you enjoyed Temple Run 2 and are looking forward to seeing Disney’s animated flick, Temple Run: Oz should be a no-brainer.
