* Now that you’ve got iOS 8.1 installed, and Apple Pay set up, you’re probably wondering where you can test out the new service. As we mentioned earlier, the Apple Store app (among others, at this point) has been updated with Apple Pay support, but what about physical stores?
* Luckily Apple has you covered, and has posted a list of all the participating retailers that are supporting Apple Pay at launch. It’s a decent-sized list, with over 30 national chains mentioned, including various clothing stores, department stores, restaurants and gas stations.
* From the Apple Pay page on Apple’s website:
* And these are just the launch partners Apple mentions. All told, Apple Pay is currently supported by more than 220,000 retailers around the US—essentially, it should work anywhere you see an NFC terminal. Additionally, Apple says Staples, Disney and others will join in soon.
* You must have either an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus (Apple Watch will also work) running iOS 8.1, and a compatible credit or debit card, to utilize Apple Pay for in-store transactions. Those that plan to purchase a new iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 will be able to use Apple Pay within apps.
