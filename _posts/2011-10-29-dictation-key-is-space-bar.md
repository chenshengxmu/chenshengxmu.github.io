* Apple has built its brand on attention to detail. The company has been known to spend months going over the tiniest components of a product to ensure perfection. Why do you think its devices come so terrifically packaged?
* Apple’s obsession with the tiny details even spills over into iOS, and the folks over at iPhoneinCanada have found a perfect example. Have you ever noticed how the dictation button changes color when you add another keyboard?
* Last week we showed you how to add a shortcut to Emoji icons on your iOS keyboard. You do this by adding a new keyboard through the International Keyboard tab in the Settings app. When you do this, the dictation key changes to the same color as the spacebar. Why?

* It’s because Apple wants to make sure that people are aware that the dictation key actually doubles as a spacebar extension. A double press of the Siri key on the keyboard inserts a space within text just like the spacebar does. How’s that for details?
