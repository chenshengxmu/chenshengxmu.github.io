* Now that Sprint officially has the iPhone, the company confirmed today to All Things D that it will keep offering unlimited data plans when it starts selling the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, starting next week.
* Although not sustainable in the long run, this move is aimed at standing up against AT&T and Verizon who both have stopped offering unlimited data plans a while ago…
* “We will be offering the benefit of our unlimited plans that start at just $69.99,” said spokeswoman Michelle Leff Mermelstein. Sprint’s $69.99 plan includes unlimited data and 450 voice minutes as well as unlimited mobile-to-mobile calling. Unlimited calling and data costs $99 a month.
* When asked about the capability of their network to handle the iPhone, Sprint said, “We have every confidence in the ability of our 3G network to handle the influx of devices we expect to get. It certainly hasn’t been an issue to date.”
* Sprint knows that sooner than later, they will have to put an end to their unlimited data plans or at least throttle them. But for the time being, they want to use this as a marketing tool in order to attract more potential iPhone users. You can’t blame them for that.
* I predict that in the next 12 months, Sprint will stop offering unlimited data plans.
* Who’s with me?
