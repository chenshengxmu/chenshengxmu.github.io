* An Apple developer has discovered code in the latest iOS 12 beta that suggests an all-new iPad Pro is coming which features Face ID and a True Depth camera. Steve Troughton-Smith notes that AvatarKit, which Apple uses to operate its Animoji and upcoming Memoji on the iPhone X, has been altered to support an iPad-size screen.
* In his Twitter posting, Troughton-Smith notes, “New in iOS 12: AvatarKit comes to iPad. Still requires a TrueDepth camera to do face tracking, though, i.e. an iPad with Face ID.”

* We’re just two months away from Apple’s fall event, which is typically held in mid-September. While most expect Cupertino to announce three new iPhones, things have been a little bit murky on the iPad Pro rumor front.
* The 10.5-inch iPad Pro and second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro were both announced in June 2017. Since then, we’ve heard very little about the next-generation devices.
* Way back in November, Bloomberg reported that the 2018 iPad Pro lineup would feature a revamped design with slimmer top and bottom bezels, a faster processor, and use a TrueDepth camera and Face ID. That same report said a second-generation Apple Pencil stylus would also be arriving with this year’s iPad Pro models.
* Soon after, another report said Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) were developing a next-generation mobile chip that would make its debut in an upcoming iPad Pro revision.
* According to the report from Chinese outlet MyDrivers, the chip was tentatively named “A11X Bionic.” Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X feature A11 Bionic chips.
* We’ll continue to follow this story. In the meantime, what would you like to see in the next iPad Pro? Give us your thoughts below.
* Besides new iOS devices, the unannounced Apple fall event could also see the introduction of new Macs, a fourth-generation Apple Watch, and more. Stay tuned.
