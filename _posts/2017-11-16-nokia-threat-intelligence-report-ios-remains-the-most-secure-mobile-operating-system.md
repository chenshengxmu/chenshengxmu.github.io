* In its Threat Intelligence Report for 2017, Nokia has reported the rates of malware infection for mobile devices for the first three quarters of 2017. The report contains a wealth of information that helps to describe the security of the mobile operating system landscape. This information was gathered using networks utilizing Nokia’s NetGuard Endpont Security service.
* The Mobile Infection Rate for 2017 is reported as 0.68%, meaning that approximately 0.68% of mobile devices were affected in the first three quarters of 2017. Some of the most interesting data points, however, are the ones comparing various mobile platforms.
* As you may expect, Android accounts for the overwhelming majority of mobile malware infections coming in at 68.50% of all infections. Furthermore, Windows/PC clocks in at 27.96% of all infectious.
* That brings us to iOS. We do not have exact numbers for iOS alone because Nokia groups Apple’s mobile OS in the “Other” category which claims 3.54% of mobile infectious. Even though exact iOS numbers are not provided, it is not difficult to see that iOS is far superior to its primary competitor based on these statistics from Nokia.
* However, if you are an Android user, you should not despair. The report from Nokia notes that the primary sources of Android malware include third-party app store and application downloads. Because of this, it is no secret that it will behoove you to restrict yourself to downloading apps from Google’s first-party Google Play Store.
* The report contains a wealth of information about the current state of mobile security that you may be interested in, and I encourage you to have a look at it.
