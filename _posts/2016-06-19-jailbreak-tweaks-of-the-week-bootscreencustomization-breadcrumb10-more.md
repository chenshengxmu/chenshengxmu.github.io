* This week has been jam-packed with interesting news from Apple following the WWDC 2016 event, but the jailbreak community is still standing in the midst of no new jailbreak for Apple’s latest iOS firmware for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.
* In this roundup, we’ll be talking about all of this week’s jailbreak tweak releases, starting with our favorites.

* If you’re looking for a way to customize what the colors of your boot screen are, then a release called BootScreenCustomization is going to be your ticket to your desires.
* This tweak lets you choose independent colors for both the background and the Apple logo on your boot screen. There are a list of colors you can pick from, and then after selecting them, you’ll just apply your changes to respring.
* The colors only apply to the boot up screen and not the respring screen, so just keep that in mind.
* For more information about how the tweak works, be sure to check out our full review.

* iOS 10 has come pretty awesome improvements to the Status Bar Breadcrumb links.
* Now you can port those features over to iOS 9 with Breadcrumb10. This gives you a smaller Breadcrumb link footprint in the Status Bar so there’s more room to dedicate to your signal strength and other Status Bar icons you may have.
* The new look and feel also looks a lot more polished than it did with iOS 9’s debuting feature, so the port is nice and clean.
* You can read our full review of Breadcrumb10 at this link.
* ColorPicker App: Lets you pick color codes from images, such as wallpapers ($0.99)
* Copic 2: Enables contact pictures everywhere on your iOS device ($1.99)
* NoPushMNFixer: Rids you of the reminder in the FB Messenger app to enable notifications (free)
* Unfortunately, things remain a bit slow as there’s no jailbreak for the current iOS firmware and many developers don’t have a jailbreak to develop on.
* Nevertheless, we remain hopeful with our fingers crossed that we’ll see a jailbreak in the future, whether for iOS 9 or iOS 10.
* If you’re jailbroken and interested in learning about more jailbreak tweaks, you can check out our previous jailbreak tweaks of the week roundup as well, and you can even stay tuned for next week’s roundup!
