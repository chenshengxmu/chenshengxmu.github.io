* iPhone X owners get seven new Dynamic wallpapers with a dark background and six new Live wallpapers that animate when pressed, all made specifically for the flagship OLED handset and not available on other iOS devices.
* The seven new Dynamic wallpapers with their all-dark background are designed to look good on that OLED panel of your iPhone X while preserving battery life. Adaptations of the old Dynamic wallpapers with a dark instead of a light blue background, these new wallpapers are offered in green, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue and multicolor-themed flavors.
* Like before, they animate automatically as you tilt the handset around.
* With these new wallpapers, you literally cannot tell the difference between the background image and the bezel or the notch—courtesy of a million to one contrast ratio versus 1300:1 on other iPhones, plus the fact that OLED technology lights up individual pixels so darker backgrounds are power-friendlier than images with lots of color.

* The six new Live wallpapers offer a lot more pop.
* They almost look like a glittery oil paint, especially when pressed with 3D Touch to animate on the Lock screen (you’ve probably seen them featured in iPhone X ads and marketing).
* Three are preloaded on iPhone X by default and the remaining three Live wallpapers will be made available to iPhone X owners by way of the forthcoming iOS 11.2 software update.
* ROUNDUP: iPhone X marketing video wallpapers
