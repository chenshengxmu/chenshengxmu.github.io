* In classic iTunes tradition, Apple has posted their “iTunes Rewind” for 2010. The best content from the iTunes Store is listed in different categories, from “top grossing” to “hot trends.”
* A huge section of iTunes Rewind 2010 is dedicated to the App Store, as one might imagine. There’s a huge selection of chosen apps to check out…

* Apple has specifically chosen to highlight Hipstamatic, Angry Birds, Flipboard and Plants v.s. Zombies on the Rewind main page. There’s also a nice description from Apple about the state of App Store apps in 2010.
* As you click through the “Hot Trends” list, there’s plenty of subcategories to look through. There’s an interesting “Shoot, Edit, Share” section on photography-related apps. Another particularly interesting one is called “The Cloud.”
* You can see the top free and paid apps for iPhone from 2010.

* There’s even a whole category devoted to Zombies!
* It’s nice to be able to go through these lists and see the apps that really stood out this year. I even spotted a couple that I had never actually downloaded, so it was nice to find a few nice apps that have already been out for a little while.
* What are some of your favorite apps from this past year?
