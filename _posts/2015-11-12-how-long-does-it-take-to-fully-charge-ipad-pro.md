* Despite its notably faster ‘A9X’ system-on-a-chip and a bigger screen with significantly increased pixel count, the iPad Pro is roughly in line with prior iPad models in terms of battery life.
* On the other hand, the jumbo-sized tablet ships with Apple’s 12W USB Power Adapter despite having a much larger battery. So, how long does it take to recharge the iPad Pro’s battery from dead to full capacity?
* According to ArsTechnica’s excruciatingly detailed review of the iPad Pro, it takes around four and a half hours to completely recharge the device if it’s not used during charging.
* This doesn’t pose a major problem if you’re charging overnight, but it’s definitely “annoying if you’re trying to grab a few percentage points in a hotel room or airport in between doing other things,” the site writes.

* Ars also notes that the iPad Pro ships with a much longer Lightning cord than usual, which is certainly another move on Apple’s part that we appreciate.
* According to iFixit’s teardown analysis, the iPad Pro is outfitted with a 3.77 V battery that weighs in at an impressive 10,307 mAh. By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is outfitted with a 3.76-Volt battery pack rated at 7,340 mAh.

* However, the iPad Pro’s four-speaker self-balancing audio design literally fills space that could have potentially been used for an extra fifty percent battery capacity.
* “Premium audio means reduced battery life,” iFixit concluded.
