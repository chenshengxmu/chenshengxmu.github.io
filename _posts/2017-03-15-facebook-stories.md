* Facebook has infamously ripped off Snapchat’s Stories feature wholesale with auto-vanishing slideshows on Instagram and WhatsApp, in addition to the similar recently introduced feature on Messenger, called Messenger Day.  The social networking behemoth was recently caught testing Snapchat-like Stories feature in its mobile app. According to TechCrunch, the company has now begun a staggered rollout of Facebook Stories to all users worldwide.
* Stories from your friends appear at the top of the mainland Facebook app.
* Simply tap a circle to see that friend’s story in an auto-advancing slideshow format. You can also tap through the photos and videos in a Story, reply to someone’s Story with a direct message and more. And when you share your own Story on Facebook, everything you’ve chosen to share automatically disappears after 24 hours.
* Using Facebook’s creative tools, you can adorn your photos or videos with emoji, drawings, annotations and more before posting them in a Story. Thankfully, Stories don’t appear in your Facebook News Feed or on your profile’s timeline.
* The feature appears to be rolling out to a large number of Facebook users across the world. It’s a staggered release so check back in a few days if you Stories don’t currently show up at the top of Facebook for iPhone and iPad.
* “The way people share today is different to five or even two years ago—it’s much more visual, with more photos and videos than ever before,” Facebook said in a statement.
* “We want to make it fast and fun for people to share creative and expressive photos and videos with whoever they want, whenever they want.”
* Facebook has about 1.7 billion monthly active users so this change is likely to irk a whole bunch of people. A new WhatsApp Status feature, for example, has frustrated many by sitting right at the top of the app—so much so that Facebook has promised to bring back the original text-based status feature.
* Has Facebook gone too far with its efforts to throw Snapchat’s core functionality into not just its mainland app, but also Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think?
