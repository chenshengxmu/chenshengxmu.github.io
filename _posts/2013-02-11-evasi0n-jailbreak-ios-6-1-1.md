* Earlier today, Apple rolled out iOS 6.1.1 to iPhone 4S owners in an effort to fix the widely reported 3G performance problems. Evidently, some kind of bug in the week-old iOS 6.1 firmware was causing service, and consequently battery, issues.
* Obviously, the first question on everyones’ minds is “will the new update break the evasi0n jailbreak?” And we’re happy to report, that per planetbeing, it doesn’t. It looks like iPhone users on iOS 6.1.1 will be able to continue jailbreaking…
* Apple released 6.1.1 for the 4S only today. The JB still works fine. We will release an updated evasi0n that recognizes it as supported.

* The only snag is, you’ll have to wait for the evad3rs to tweak evasi0n a little bit to work with the new update. We’ve tried jailbreaking our own iPhone 4S on 6.1.1, but it appears that the popular utility doesn’t recognize the firmware. So sit tight.
* As usual, we’ll let you know as soon as the new version of evasi0n is available.
* Now, for those of you still on iOS 6.1, you’ll want to make sure that you install the update for the ‘evasi0n 6.0-6.1 Untether’ package in Cydia, as it disables over-the-air updates. You don’t want to accidentally install an OTA update in the future.
* You’ll also want to make sure that you save your SHSH blobs for iOS 6.1. Typically, Apple stops signing the current firmware when it releases an update. And while we’re not sure if it will this time since 6.1.1 was 4S-only, it’s better safe than sorry.
* Stay tuned.
