* During the second quarter of 2018, China’s Huawei overtook Apple to become the No. 2 smartphone provider in the world. During the quarter, Huawei delivered shipments of 54.2 million units compared to 41.3 million units for Apple. The change represents the first time since the second quarter of 2010 when Apple wasn’t No. 1 or No. 2 in the world, according to the latest IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker survey.

This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines.
* For the quarter, Samsung had a 20.9 percent market share compared to Huawei’s 15.8 percent and Apple’s 12.1 percent.

It is worth noting that Apple moved into the top position each of the last two holiday quarters following its product refresh, so it’s likely we’ll see continued movement among the top ranked companies in 2018 and beyond.
