* Engadget has the picture of a shelf tag for a 16GB white iPhone 4, supposedly spotted at a Best Buy location in Houston. At $599, we can only imagine this is a contract-free iPhone.
* There has been more and more rumors lately about the availability of a white iPhone 4, which might lead us to think Apple’s own unicorn might indeed hit the shelves sooner than later. Heck, even Woz confirmed it…
* So what do you think? Real or fake? At this point, who’s even waiting for the white iPhone 4 anyway?
