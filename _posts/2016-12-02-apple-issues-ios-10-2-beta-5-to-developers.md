* Apple on Friday released a fifth beta of iOS 10.2 (build 14C89) to its registered developers enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. The updated beta software can be deployed over-the-air through Settings → General → Software Update on an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad which has installed a prior iOS 10.2 beta and an appropriate configuration profile. The full installer can be downloaded from Apple’s dedicated portal for developers at developer.apple.com.
* The new iOS 10.2 beta arrived four days following iOS 10.2 beta 4 and more than a month after the first major update to iOS 10 dropped in the form of iOS 10.1 with Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus and other improvements.
* iOS 10.2 provides support for a new Single Sign-On feature that remembers cable logins across video apps and includes Apple’s new channel guide app and the Emergency SOS feature which debuted on the Apple Watch last year.
* Other new features in iOS 10.2: three iPhone 7-specific wallpapers, an option for preserving Camera settings, “Love” and “Celebration” screen effects in Messages, additional music sorting options and dedicated buttons for Repeat and Shuffle in the Music app.
* Lastly, the softwares brings out refreshed designs for many of the existing emoji characters, in addition to many new Unicode 9.0 emoji like clown face, drooling face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant and more, plus profession emoji in male and female genders like firefighter, mechanic, lawyer, doctor, scientist and more.
* We’ll update the post with new changes in iOS 10.2 beta 5 if we encounter them.
