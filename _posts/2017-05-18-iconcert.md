title: IconCert lets you know when your Yalu certificate expires

* The Yalu iOS 10 jailbreak, just like the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak before it, is a semi-untethered jailbreak. This means you must re-sign the jailbreak app after 7 days with Cydia Impactor in order to keep your jailbreak app functioning after a reboot.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called IconCert by iOS developer faz helps you keep better track of your Yalu app’s signing status so you can take the proper action to re-sign it accordingly.
* [Update]: The tweak was removed from Cydia after it was conflicting with many tweaks. As of Thursday evening, the tweak has been reinstated into Cydia with the warning that IconCert doesn’t play nicely with jailbreak tweaks that modify or theme app icons on the Home screen. Please be wary of installing potential conflicting tweaks for the safety of your jailbreak!
* Although one could just keep using their semi-untethered jailbreak beyond the expiration date as long as they didn’t reboot their device in the meantime, those who reboot more often or let their phones die are at the mercy of this style of jailbreak and need to pay more attention to their Yalu app signing status than others.
* IconCert displays an indicator on the Yalu app icon that lets you know exactly how much longer you can go without signing your Yalu app with Cydia Impactor.
* If this functionality sounds familiar, it’s because a jailbreak app called CertRemainTime could tell you how much time is remaining on your current signage. Of course, this requires having an additional app icon on your Home screen, so IconCert might be a better choice for many.
* Depending on your circumstances, the app icon might display something like “7.00 d,” which indicates 7 more days, or something like “3.5 h,” which indicates 3.5 more hours. If you’re operating well beyond your Yalu app’s expiration period and haven’t rebooted your device lately, then it will say “expired” instead as you see in our example above.
* Ending up in a scenario where you’re locked out of your jailbreak because you didn’t sign the Yalu app when you should have means you’re stuck without a jailbreak until you get back to a computer with Cydia Impactor (unless you’re using a tool like Extender Installer), so the goal of the tweak is to help train you to re-sign the app more frequently.
* Since these semi-untethered jailbreaks have expiration dates on them, it’s always a good idea to stay information about when you need to re-sign the app with some kind of indicator, so this tweak is actually a great idea for most of the community.
* IconCert is a release that I can’t recommend enough for most jailbreakers on iOS 10, so if you want to grab it for yourself, it’s available from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t have any options to configure.
