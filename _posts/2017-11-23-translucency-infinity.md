* If you look at your Reminders app for a moment, you’ll notice a translucent region near the top of the app. Interestingly, Apple uses this aesthetic in very few of iOS’ stock apps, and this makes the effect feel a little bit out of place.
* Here to fix that is a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Translucency Infinity by iOS developer EthanRDoesMC. This tweak ports a similar effect to as many of your apps as you want, letting you gain a little more consistency across the board.
* To obtain a better idea of what your apps might look like after installing Translucency Infinity, just take a gander at the screenshot examples above. You should be able to discern our Home Screen wallpaper ever so slightly through the blur.
* You can configure Translucency Infinity after installation by going to the tweak’s preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you can do a multitude of things, such as:
* Translucency Infinity incorporates a respring button inside of its preference pane for your convenience, and you should use it to save your changes any time you adjust any of the tweak’s settings.
* We should note right off the bat that Translucency Infinity won’t look great in every app, but some apps pull the look off quite well. Fortunately, you can choose which apps the tweak impacts, so you can easily exclude apps that it doesn’t play nicely with and they’ll just keep their stock look and feel.
* From our experience, Translucency Infinity looks best in apps with primarily solid-white backgrounds, such as those shown in our screenshot examples (Apollo, Messages, and Settings). Obviously, your results may vary depending on the apps you use.
* Translucency Infinity is definitely a work in progress, but it can be a fun way to add some character to your jailbroken iOS 10 device. If you want to try it out for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
