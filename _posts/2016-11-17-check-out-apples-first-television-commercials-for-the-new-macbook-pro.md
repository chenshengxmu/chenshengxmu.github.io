* The new MacBook Pro hasn’t even shipped to everyone who have pre-ordered it, but on Thursday Apple began airing its very inaugural television commercial. Aptly titled “Bulb,” the video runs one minute and 37 seconds long and frames the expensive notebook as a tool “for ideas to come”.
* “Ideas have always pushed the world forward,” Apple says in the ad. “Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come. The new MacBook Pro.”
* It’s a quite nicely done ad, check it out embedded below and let us know what you think of it in the comment section below.
* How do you like Apple’s first MacBook Pro ad?
