* Apple Music ranks highest among customers in the just-released 2016 J.D. Power Streaming Music Satisfaction Study. The high profile marketing research firm says the 1-year old streaming service beat out veterans like Pandora and Spotify in 3 of the 6 measures in its study, and first overall.
* “The streaming music customer experience appears to be affected by a number of dimensions, including paid vs. free streaming, device choice and content selection,” said Kirk Parsons, senior director and technology, media & telecom practice leader at J.D. Power. “The key to success, however, is increasingly becoming how well streaming music brands create a viable music ecosystem that can not only support multiple types of devices, but also facilitate listeners’ social sharing and following of playlists with others.”
* The 2016 Streaming Music Satisfaction Study is based on responses from 4,482 customers, taken from June and July 2016. At its September iPhone 7 event, Apple announced that it now has 17+ million Apple Music subscribers. The standard service costs $10/month, but a free trial is available.
