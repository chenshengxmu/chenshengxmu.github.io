* Apple seeded another beta of OS X 10.10.3 on Monday for both members of the Mac Developer Center and public beta testers. The new build, available to download through the Mac App Store’s Software Update mechanism, carries the build number 14D127 – compared to the previous build number of 14D113 that was released one week ago.
* Monday’s release marks the sixth build of the new OS X 10.10.3 software. There’s no word on any new features in the 14D127 build, however it’s expected to carry bug fixes.
* Apple hasn’t provided word on when OS X 10.10.3 will be released to the public. It’s a notable update, featuring the brand-new Photos app, including support for Google 2-step verification when setting up accounts, Force Touch APIs for developers, and various emoji improvements.
