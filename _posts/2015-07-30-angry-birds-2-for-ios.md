* As promised, Finnish mobile games maker Rovio today released Angry Birds 2, the official sequel to its original bird-flinging franchise. Available on a free-to-play basis, Angry Birds 2 for iPhone and iPad isn’t a radical departure from the proven formula which made the original games such a rage.
* In Angry Birds 2, your favorite feathered heroes embark on a brand new adventure as they storm Piggy Island to rescue their poor stolen eggs, all over again.
* The sequel introduces some fun new elements to the gameplay experience such as all-new bird characters to choose from, spells, multi-stage levels, scheming boss piggies and much more.
* Unlike prior Angry Birds games, Angry Birds 2 notches things up a bit by allowing you to choose which bird to fling next, which adds a new element of strategic thinking.
* Each bird has its own characteristics so you’ll have to choose the right bird for the task at hand. And as you crush the piggies and blocks, you will earn extra pigs and fill up your Destruct-O-Meter.
* Taking advantage of modern technologies, Angry Birds 2 looks awesome in terms of graphics. The Piggy Island is filled with new objects, quirky details and fun animations such as exotic plants.

* To make things even more interesting, levels now have multiple stages for an added challenge. More interesting than that, you can now use all-new spells that give you an added advantage, like Blizzards, Hot Chilis, Golden Ducks and more.
* The official launch trailer is included below.
* Angry Birds 2 sports some amusingly scheming boss piggies, including Foreman Pig, Chef Pig and the infamous King Pig that “will stop at nothing to keep your eggs.” In terms of multiplayer, the game lets you connect to Facebook to play daily tournaments or challenge friends from across the world in the Arena.

* What’s Arena, you ask… It’s basically an endless mode in which players must play the game until they run out of birds and spells.
* As mentioned before, the game is offered on a free-to-play basis with additional in-game gems available for cash through the In-App Purchase mechanism.
* The game is optimized for the iPhone 5, iPad 3, iPad mini 2 and fifth-generation iPod touch or newer. “You can try it on older devices, but we can’t guarantee a smooth bird flinging experience,” notes Rovio.
* And here’s the official gameplay trailer.
* The 86.3-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and features native display support for the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes.
* Grab Angry Birds 2 at no charge in the App Store.
