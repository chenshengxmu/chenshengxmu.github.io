* All iPhone 8 models will feature curved OLED displays, reports The Korea Herald. Citing sources familiar with the plans, the outlet says Apple has placed large orders with Samsung Display for plastic (not glass) OLED panels—similar to those used on the Galaxy S7 Edge—to use in its next handset.
* The source also said the device may feature new sensing tech, stating “the upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology, which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device.” It may, however, decide not to use the tech, they added without providing any additional details.
* After several quarters of struggling iPhone sales, analysts expect Apple’s 2017 handset to be a significant upgrade. Rumors thus far have suggested it will include an edge-to-edge, bezel-free display with no physical Home button, wireless charging, and 3 standalone models with differing feature sets.
