* After releasing the first beta of iOS 9.2.1 to developers earlier today, Apple also seeded OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 beta 1 to members of the Apple Developer Program.
* The first beta of what would become El Capitan’s third major software update since its October 2015 debut carries a build number of 15D9c and is available as a standalone download through Apple’s portal for developers or through the Mac App Store’s Update tab on Macs enrolled in the beta program.
* Release notes accompanying the download say that this pre-release edition of the OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 software update will improve the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac, but make no mention of potential new features or enhancements.
* We’ll be updating the post with changes as we encounter them. As a refresher, OS X El Capitan 10.11.2  was released for public consumption less than two weeks ago.
