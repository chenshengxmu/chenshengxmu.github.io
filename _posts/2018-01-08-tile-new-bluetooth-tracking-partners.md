* Ahead of CES 2018, Tile today announced several new partnerships that will take advantage of the “Tile Platform” program which builds in their popular item-tracking Bluetooth technology that works like Apple’s Find My AirPods feature.
* Bose is one of the supported companies adding location-finding capabilities to the SoundSport Wireless and QuietControl 30 headphones. Other gadgets bringing support for the Tile Platform include Samsonite luggage, Boosted Boards and Prepeller Health’s inhalers.
* The Bose partnership is the most interesting to me as it is essentially mirroring the Find My AirPods feature that Apple added for their own earphones.

* Bose will start selling updated versions of their headphones with Tile’s technology in the Spring. Fortunately, existing uses will also have the features added through a firmware update.
* “With the Tile Platform, we’re extending the finding power of Tile and its global community to leading brands spanning audio, travel, transportation and even digital health management,” said Mike Farley, CEO and co-founder of Tile.
* “Whether it’s a pair of wireless headphones, a suitcase filled with precious memories or a life-saving connected inhaler, we want to make sure consumers can find their items no matter where they are, whether under the couch or halfway around the world.”
* Samsonite will be launching their integrated luggage also in the Spring, with the rest of the partners coming later in the year. Of course, these aren’t the first products we’ve seen to use Tile’s tracking technology built in.
* Nomad was one of the first, adding Tile’s Bluetooth tracking to their rugged battery pack. KeySmart also built the Tile technology into their popular key organization system, as evidenced by our hands-on video embedded below.
* Which of these upcoming integrations sounds most useful to you?
* Let us know down in the comments.
