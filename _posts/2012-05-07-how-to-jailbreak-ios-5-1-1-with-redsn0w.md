* iOS 5.1.1 was just released, and with it come a few bug fixes. If you’re worried about maintaining your untethered jailbreak, then it’s important not to update.
* If, on the other hand, you have a device that’s currently jailbreakable on iOS 5.1, you can use the latest version of RedSn0w to perform a tethered jailbreak iOS 5.1.1 with a few easy steps.
* Check inside for the full video tutorial…
* You will need your 5.1 firmware for the device that you want to jailbreak, as RedSn0w currently doesn’t recognize iOS 5.1.1. This is for A4 devices only.
* Step 1: Download the latest version of RedSn0w 0.9.10b8b from our download page.
* Step 2: Connect your device to your computer, place your device into DFU mode, and run RedSn0w.
* Step 3: Go to Extras > Select IPSW > and point to your iOS 5.1 firmware for this device.
* Step 4: Once RedSn0w successfully identifies the 5.1 firmware, head back to the main page of RedSn0w and click Jailbreak.
* Step 5: Once it identifies the build, click Next where it asks you to install Cydia.
* Step 6: Cydia will be installed, and your device will reboot. Upon reboot, place the device back into DFU mode.
* Step 7: Perform a tethered boot via RedSn0w by going back to the Extras page and clicking Just Boot.
* Step 8: Your device will reboot, and you will have a usable Cydia icon on your Home screen.
* Note: This is a tethered iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak. Once RedSn0w is updated for iOS 5.1.1 you will no longer have to follow step 3.
* Remember this is only for iOS 5.1 jailbreakable devices. Meaning it won’t work with the iPad 2, the iPhone 4S, or the new iPad.
* For additional help with RedSn0w, DFU mode, etc. be sure to visit our dedicated RedSn0w page.
