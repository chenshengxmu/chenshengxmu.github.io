* The evad3rs just released evasi0n 1.3, an update specifically targeted to iPhone 4S users who are running iOS 6.1.1.
* Earlier today, Apple released iOS 6.1.1 for iPhone 4S users, an update that was pushed to fix spotty 3G issues on the device. As always when a new firmware version drops, the main question on our mind was: will this break the jailbreak? We were quick to find out that even though evasi0n was not working with 6.1.1, it didn’t fix the exploits used by evasi0n to jailbreak your device. Ultimately, evad3rs member PlanetBeing let us know that it was only a matter of time until evasion would get an update for iOS 6.1.1, and this time has come…
* In a tweet sent out seconds ago, the evad3rs just notified everyone that evasi0n 1.3 with support for iOS 6.1.1 on iPhone 4S has been released.
* If you have already updated to iOS 6.1.1, you might want to grab a copy of evasi0n 1.3 and jailbreak your device. If you have not updated to iOS 6.1.1 yet, you have a couple options.
* If you don’t have any problem with iOS 6.1 and your current jailbreak works just fine for you, no one forces you to update to iOS 6.1.1.
* If however you are experiencing issues with iOS 6.1 on your iPhone 4S, we suggest you first backup your device, then restore your iPhone in iTunes to 6.1.1 (do not update Over The Air). From there, you’ll be able to run evasi0n 1.3 and you’ll be on your way to a freshly jailbroken iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.1.
* If you’re not sure how to use evasi0n, feel free to refer to our evasi0n tutorial for Mac, and our evasi0n guide for Windows.
* As always, you can download evasi0n directly from our download page.
