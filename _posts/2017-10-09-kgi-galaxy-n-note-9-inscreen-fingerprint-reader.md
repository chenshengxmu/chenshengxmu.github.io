* Samsung’s next-generation Note may come with a key feature that Apple reportedly had to drop from its iPhone X: an optical fingerprint sensor embedded underneath the cover glass.
* The Galaxy maker is apparently looking to use a technology that allows the OLED screen to double as a light source for the sensor, which results in better battery life.
* According to a report that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent to clients on Saturday, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Galaxy Note 9 may have an “under-display optical fingerprint” sensor when it’s released in the second half of 2018.
* Samsung could buy the part that enables this sensor from three different suppliers: Synaptics, Korean firm BeyondEyes and its own subsidiary Samsung LSI.
* “In our latest analysis of recent under-display optical fingerprint recognition industry developments, we see Korean suppliers and Synaptics as having better visibility among suppliers,” reads the note.
* We can rule out Synaptics since they are an Apple supplier. BeyondEyes and Samsung LSI have already shipped part samples to Samsung, according to the note.
* Using an in-screen fingerprint sensor could be Samsung’s stop-gap until it can match iPhone X’s Face ID. “With regard to the latest biometrics technologies, however, we favor the 3D-sensing segment,” the analyst wrote.
* Kuo previously estimated that Apple may have an 18 to 30-month advantage over Android vendors in terms of Face ID and related depth-sensing camera sensors.
