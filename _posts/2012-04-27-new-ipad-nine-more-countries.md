* As noted by TheNextWeb, Apple is launching its latest iPad in nine new countries today. This means that the tablet is now available in 30 countries within less than 60 days of hitting the market, making it one of Apple’s fastest international product rollouts ever.
* Apple missed iPad sales projections by nearly a million units last quarter. But between the upcoming educational buying season and increased availability, that shouldn’t happen again. Keep reading for a full list of the new countries…
* Still noticeably absent from this list is China. This is more than likely due to Apple’s ongoing battle with Proview over the iPad trademark in the country, which is otherwise a crucial market for the company.
