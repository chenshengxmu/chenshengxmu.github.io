* Beginning today, Aug. 16, Verizon Wireless is offering its Unlimited cellular customers a free six-month subscription to Apple Music. The promotion, which was announced earlier this month, isn’t just for new Apple Music users. Those who already subscribe to the service will also benefit. Here’s how to sign up, regardless of your status.
* To take advantage of this offer, you must have a Verizon Wireless line with Unlimited data. To get started:
* 1) You must visit this website via a desktop or through a mobile browser.
* 2) Once logging into your account, select the line you’d like to enroll in the offer and then accept the terms and conditions.
* 3) Next, you’ll receive a text message with a link.
* For devices that already have Apple Music installed, it’ll open up the app. If that app hasn’t been installed, the App Store will open for download.  The free offer can also be activated through the My Verizon app on your Verizon device. Look under the Account header and then “Add-ons.”
* Note: If you are a current Apple Music customer, you’ll need to cancel your service first. As long as you activate your new service through Verizon with the same Apple ID, your music and playlists will be carried over.
* Visit this page for directions on how to cancel Apple Music and any other App Store subscription.
* As a Verizon spokesperson explained to iDownloadBlog on Thursday:
* Apple Music is free to all Verizon Unlimited subscribers, including those on Verizon Plan Unlimited, Go Unlimited, Beyond Unlimited and Above Unlimited.
* Customers can cancel their subscription at any time by visiting vzw.com/applemusic.
* This sounds like a great deal, especially now that we have confirmed that current Apple Music customers can also benefit. With a regular Apple Music subscription priced at $9.99 per month, this leads to a saving of $59.94 before taxes.
* Are you planning on signing up for this promotion? Let us know below.
