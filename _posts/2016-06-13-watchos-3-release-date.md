* Apple has taken the wraps off watchOS 3 this morning during the keynote presentation at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. With features designed to advance the experience for Apple Watch owners, watchOS 3 will release this fall, Apple confirmed today. The major new version of the Apple Watch operating system will be released at no charge as an over-the-air update.
* A developer-only preview of watchOS 3 is available starting today for those who are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. The Apple Beta Software Program does not support watchOS betas so members of the general public wishing to get a taste of these new features will have to wait until this fall.
* watchOS 3 includes a number of features like much faster application launch times, a new Scribble input method, Control Center, an SOS mode with support for emergency calls, a Breathe app and much more.
