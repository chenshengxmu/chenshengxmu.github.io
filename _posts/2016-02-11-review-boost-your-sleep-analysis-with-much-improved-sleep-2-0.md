* David Smith’s excellent Sleep++ app is my killer app when it comes to sleep analysis, a glaring omission from the Apple Watch. It’s become second nature for me to open Sleep++ as I tuck myself in bed for the evening.
* This native watchOS 2 app collects data from watch sensors to measure sleep quality and duration, which can then be reviewed in greater detail in a companion iPhone app and synced with your Health database.
* The updated Sleep++ 2.0, now available as a free download in the App Store, takes sleep analysis to the next level with major improvements to its sleep analysis engine and new features such as better Health integration, an improved Night Detail view, night trimming and timezone support.
* The elevated experience starts with the app’s perfected sleep analysis algorithm which now allows for more fine grained sleep-type characterization, making it far better at helping you understand your sleep.
* The app can now detect deep sleep and light sleep states, as well as restlessness and wakefulness. Like the original edition, Sleep++ 2.0 pours all this newly introduced data into the HealthKit database on your iPhone for further use, including more detailed sleep analysis.
* Previously, only the basic data was sent to the Health app.

* With timezone support, Sleep++ 2.0 lets world travelers get a more consistent view of their sleep as they roam the globe. In the companion iPhone app, you’ll find an improved Night Detail screen that makes it easy to see the times when you slept well or were restless while giving a more detailed breakdown of the quality of each night.
* Sleep++ requires you to both tap a button when you go to bed and when you wake up. Sometimes I forget to tell the app I just woke up, resulting in erroneous data and requiring me to delete the whole night in the iPhone app.
* With Sleep++ 2.0, this becomes a thing of the past as I can now trim nights from the detail screen in the iPhone app for those cases when I forget to stop the sleep analysis upon waking up in the morning.

* This app’s creator is also behind Pedometer++, one of the finest step-counting app, the powerful RSS reader called Feed Wrangler, the Emoji++ keyboard and many other apps you might want to check out.
* Read my review of the inaugural version of Sleep++.
* Considering this app is aimed at Apple Watch owners, the fact t’s been downloaded around 170,000 times since its September 2015 debut is an impressive feat.
* Sleep++ requires an iPhone with iOS 9.0 and Apple Watch. The app is English-only and available at no cost in the App Store though you can thank the developer by removing advertisement with a one-time $1.99 In-App Purchase.
* Grab Sleep++ for free in the App Store.
