* After announcing back in January that its iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June 30, 2016, Apple today issued an email blast, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, in which it reminds developers of the impending shutdown that’ll bring an end to monetization revenues and app promotion.
* Despite the iAd App Network going offline starting July 1, developers will still be able to earn revenue from advertising from their own direct sales or by using other third party monetization services.
* All Developer Advertising Services Agreements will be terminated on June 30, 2016, at 11:59am Pacific Time, reads the message. In a support document, Apple explains that apps which have implemented the deprecated iAd.Framework classes “should not crash solely because of the deprecation” though Xcode error messages are to be expected.
* All revenue generated by advertising in participating apps will be paid out by September 30, 2016. No minimum revenue requirement will apply. Revenue and campaign performance reports will be available on iAd Workbench until December 31, 2016.
* Still, developers are encouraged to remove the iAd framework and connection from their apps. The support document provides a handy list of the Classes and their APIs in the iAd SDK which are being deprecated.
* BuzzFeed reported that Apple would dramatically scale back operations by dismantling its iAd sales team, moving to a more automated ad platform in which publishers handle most of the heavy-lifting.
