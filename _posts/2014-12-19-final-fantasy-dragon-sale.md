* Joining Halfbrick and others, Square Enix has launched a holiday promotional sale for all of its iOS games. So for a limited time, you can pickup some of the studio’s biggest titles for iPhone and iPad at a significant discount.
* The Square Enix library contains a number of popular console ports, including Final Fantasy 1-6, and Final Fantasy Tactics, as well as multiple Chaos Rings and Dragon Quest games. We’ve listed all of the discounted titles below.
* Additionally, Square Enix is now offering a Tomb Raider bundle for $4.99. This gives you Tomb Raiders 1 & 2, as well as Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light for the price of one game, and if you’re interested, you can grab it here.
* There’s no word on how long these prices will last for, but they should be good through the holidays.
