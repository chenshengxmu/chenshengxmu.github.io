* After a long wait, Comex released JailbreakMe 3.0. And now a huge number of iOS devices have already utilised the hack.
* The jailbreaking method, which simply requires a user visit a website and press a button, is aimed at jaibreaking iOS devices running version 4.3.3, as well as being the first jailbreak available for Apple’s iPad 2.
* With experts warning that the same method Comex uses could also be used in a malicious context, it was only a matter of time until Apple looked to plug the PDF exploit that the jailbreak relies on….
* Now, according to The Associated Press, an Apple spokesperson has said that the Cupertino outfit will look to fix the exploit used by JailbreakMe in an upcoming iOS update – an update we expect to see very, very shortly.
* “Apple Inc. spokeswoman Bethan Lloyd said Thursday the company is “aware of this reported issue and developing a fix that will be available to customers in an upcoming software update.”
* She declined to specify when the update would be available.”
* The current PDF exploit is similar to the one used in an earlier release of JailbreakMe, and that particular hole was plugged within a week. We see no reason for there not being a similar timescale this time around.
* If you are relying on JailbreakMe and still want the security afforded by plugging the PDF hole, we suggest you install PDFPatcher, available via Cydia.
* Turns out you can have your cake and eat it after all!
* Have you used JailbreakMe 3.0 to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch? Do so now before Apple pushed the next iOS update!
