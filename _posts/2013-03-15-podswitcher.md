title: 'PodSwitcher' available on Cydia
---
* PodSwitcher is a jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.49. The purpose of the tweak is to allow you to interface with the stock Music app via the iPhone’s app switcher. PodSwitcher adds advanced controls that you won’t find with the stock Music controls found in the app switcher. Along with the advanced controls, you can peruse your entire music library using various built-in animations like Cover Flow, Linear, Rotary, and more. If you’ve given PodSwitcher a try, share your experience with the tweak in our comments.
