* There have been many keyboard tweaks released over the years, and I’ve had issues with practically all of them.
* iKeyWi is the latest keyboard tweak to make its way to Cydia, but this one if probably one of the more stable ones that I’ve used thus far.
* That’s not to say that it’s not without a few opportunities for improvement, but as you’ll see on video, it’s a very good start…
* The main gripe I have with iKeyWi is one that’s already been acknowledged by the developer — the lack of landscape custom 5th row keyboard support. Placing your device into landscape mode simply makes the 5th row of keys disappear. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
* My other gripe is the lack of a proper Settings app panel. While it’s extremely easy to customize the 5th row keys using iFile, it would be even easier to do so from the Settings app.
* Other than that, iKeyWi is a competent keyboard tweak. It doesn’t rely on WinterBoard, and it works on iOS 5. Those are pretty big accomplishments when you consider some of the competition in this space.
* At $1.99, iKeyWi is a bit steep when you consider the few issues I raised above, but for those of you desperate for a 5th row keyboard tweak that’s stable, you can head over to Cydia and download it today.
* What’s your experience with keyboard tweaks been like?
