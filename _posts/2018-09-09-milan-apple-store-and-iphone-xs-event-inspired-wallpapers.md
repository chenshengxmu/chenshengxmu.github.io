* We are just days away from the upcoming iPhone Xs event, which will be live streamed starting at 10:00AM pacific time, on Wednesday September 12. Apple is preparing to host the announcement in Steve Jobs theater on their Apple Park campus in Cupertino. In preparation, the Apple TV streaming app is updated with a new logo, which inspired this week’s Wallpapers of the Week selection. Additionally, download logo wallpapers from the recently opened Milan Apple Store.
* If you missed them last week, we have an incredible collection of media invitation wallpapers for the iPhone Xs event, while this week is specifically inspired by the Apple TV iconography.
* The following two wallpapers are inspired by the Milan store, which opened late July. Both sets of wallpapers are designed and modified by AR72014. We have a gallery of selected wallpapers that he created, but follow him on Twitter @AR72014 to directly view all his releases.
