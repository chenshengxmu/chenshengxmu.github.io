* Confirming recent rumor-mill talk of a glossy black edition of its Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone, Samsung today officially announced a new Black Pearl color option in an attempt to counter what’s been reported as high demand for Apple’s new Black and Jet Black iPhone 7 models. The new colorway, Samsung said, “radiates quality and luxury” and was designed to be “modern and striking”.
* “The sleek black finish blankets the entire device—edges and all—and adds depth to its glass design,” said the South Korean chaebol. “The result is a stylish all-black aesthetic that captures the essence of the color in its purest form.”

* After seeing success with the Note 7’s Coral Blue colorway, Samsung’s recently added it to the Galaxy S7 lineup, joining the existing matte Onyx Black color option. The Pink Gold edition of the Galaxy S7 was released earlier this year.
* The new Black Pearl color option will be exclusive to 128GB versions of the device and debut in select markets on December 9, Samsung has said. Counting today’s addition of the new glossy black color option, the Galaxy S7 is now available in White Pearl, Black Onyx, Black Pearl, Gold Platinum, Pink Gold, Silver Titanium and Coral Blue.
