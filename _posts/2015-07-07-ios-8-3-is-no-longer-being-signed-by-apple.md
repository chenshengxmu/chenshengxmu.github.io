* Wishing to downgrade (or upgrade) to iOS 8.3? If so, you’re too late, as Apple just stopped signing iOS 8.3.
* As has been the trend lately, Apple tends to continue signing older firmware even after new firmware—such as last week’s iOS 8.4—has been out for a while. This time, a full week passed before Apple closed the doors on iOS 8.3.
* What does this mean for users?
* It means that if you wish to downgrade from iOS 8.4, you simply can’t. It also means that if you’re on a lower firmware, such as iOS 8.1.3, and wish to upgrade to iOS 8.3 instead of iOS 8.4, you can’t.
* In a nutshell, it means that you basically are forced to upgrade to iOS 8.4 in all situations. Granted, there have been some rumblings of potential downgrades, so you should always look into saving your SHSH blobs for all firmwares, but nothing solid has come from this yet.
* The good news is that iOS 8.4 can be jailbroken, so it’s not like jailbreakers are out of the game yet. But, this does mean that you should definitely save your iOS 8.4 SHSH blobs in preparation for the next version of iOS that is coming.
* As always, you can visit IPSW.me to check the signing status of Apple firmware.
* What are your thoughts on this inevitable change?
