* Pokémon GO players are in for some goodies this week as Niantic is rolling out some of the first of the game’s second-generation Pokémon to players, with more than 100 additional monsters coming within the next few months.
* The introduction of these new Pokémon is expected to renew player interest and give existing players something new to hunt after.
* Among the first of the second-generation Pokémon to roll off of the assembly line are Pichu and Togepi, which can be obtained by hatching specific types of eggs by walking.
* Professor Willow has discovered Togepi and Pichu hatching from Eggs! Starting later today, Trainers will have the opportunity to hatch these and several other Pokémon that were originally discovered in the Johto Region in Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver video games. These are the first of more Pokémon coming to Pokémon GO over the next few months. Be sure to use the hashtag #PokemonGO on Twitter to share your experiences as you explore your local neighborhoods with family and friends, walk to hatch these Pokémon from Eggs, and register them to your collection this holiday season. We can’t wait to see what Pokémon you’ve hatched!
* There is no official word just yet on what types of eggs (2km, 5km, or 10km) you will need to hatch to find yourself with one of these Pokémon, however the teaser video appears to be showing the colors of the 5km egg, which isn’t the best of news since there are so many possible Pokémon you can hatch from a 5km egg:
* With the Pokémon pool of 5km eggs being so diverse, you may have to hatch a lot of them to get a Pichu or Togepi, so this might be a good time to start utilizing all those egg incubators you’ve been saving up from your leveling up as a trainer. Players can also utilize in-app purchases to buy more egg incubators to increase their odds.
* In addition to the new second-generation Pokémon that are coming to town, Niantic is also throwing in another goodie to get everyone in the holiday spirit. Pikachu is now running around with Santa hats and if you’re lucky enough to catch one, you’ll have a limited-edition Pokémon that will retain its hat even as the holidays pass and as you evolve Pikachu into a Raichu:

* The Santa hat-wearing Pikachu will be available to catch starting today through to December 29th at 10:00 A.M. PST, which gives you a little over two weeks to try to find and catch one. If you miss out, it’s unknown if the event will repeat itself next year or not, so you may want to get out there and try to grab your own festive electric rodent Pokémon.
