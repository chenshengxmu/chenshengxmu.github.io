title: Apple, Samsung, Google and others meet with UN for patent licensing pow-wow
---
* Apple, Google, Samsung and others meet today – not in a courtroom but in neutral Switzerland. The discussion, moderated by the UN’s International Telecommunications Union, focuses on whether the key principal of patent licensing is preventing products from coming to market.

* The talks follow Apple and Samsung high-profile patent dispute and the EU investigating whether a number of companies are abusing the patent guidelines…
* RAND – “reasonable and non-discriminatory” patent licensing is at the heart of today’s pow-wow. According to the UN, the talks will assess the effectiveness of patent cases often based on the definition of RAND.
* The BBC is reporting the discussions could result in changes to patent rules “so that products cannot be blocked on the basis of standard-essential patent disputes.” Apple and Microsoft are among the companies looking to change the rules. Android-maker Google is also calling for patent reform. Just recently, the Mountain View, Calif. Internet giant expressed frustration over the continued patent wars.
* Although we won’t know if any agreement is arrived on patent licensing, RAND is increasingly becoming a point of contention among companies. What is reasonable for Apple may not be viewed as such by Samsung, for example.
* What do you think? Are patent squabbles straying too far from the actual technology, often resulting in wrangles over defining what is “reasonable” in terms of patent licensing?
