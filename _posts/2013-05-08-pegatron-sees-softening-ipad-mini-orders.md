* In another sign of consumers postponing purchasing iPad minis in anticipation of a second-generation model, said to sport Apple’s high-resolution Retina display, contract manufacturer Pegatron has cautioned investors Wednesday to brace themselves for as much as a 30 percent revenue decline when it reports second-quarter earnings, the most since a 37 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011.
* Although Pegatron assembles Apples’ iPhone 4S and iPad mini, the Taiwanese corporation also acts as a contract manufacturer for consumer electronics from other makers. But as Apple is one of its principal clients – and given Apple’s high-volume needs – Pegatron attributed the decline to shrinking iPad mini orders…
* According to CEO Jason Cheng, the iPad mini accounts for more than half of Pegatron’s consumer-electronics revenue. Additionally, the iPhone 4S contributes a majority of sales in the communications division.
* According to Bloomberg, Chen blamed the iPad mini revenue decline “more on demand” as “price has been stable.”
* Notably, Apple’s own guidance for the second quarter includes a 20 percent revenue drop versus the first quarter, which is about the same decline that Pegatron is now observing so no surprises here.
* Another contract manufacturer, Foxconn, also faced a decline in Apple orders and consequentially reported nineteen percent decline in first-quarter revenue, the most in at last thirteen years.
* But it’s not just the iPad mini.
* Pegatron makes Surface tablets for Microsoft, which I’m sure everyone knows isn’t selling well, to put it mildly.
* “Not just tablets, also e-books and games consoles, almost every item is moving in a negative direction,” the CEO told the news organization.
* Can’t wait to check out WSJ’s spin to this.
* According to NPD DisplaySearch, Retina screens for the second-generation iPad mini will enter mass-production in June. The firm is actually expecting two iPad mini models, one in the second half of 2012 and another in the first quarter of 2014 with a faster processor.
