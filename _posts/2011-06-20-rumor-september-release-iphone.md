* We actually haven’t heard too many new hardware rumors in the last few weeks. It seems like everyone is too busy digging through Apple’s new iOS 5 software for new features to really care at the moment.
* But gossip picked up again over the weekend, as International Business Times stirred up the rumor pot with further speculation on the iPhone 5’s release date. The publication believes that we’ll all be lining up on September 7th for the next iPhone…
* We believe that’s ridiculous. Besides a few last minute hopeful wishes that Apple’s next smartphone would be unveiled at WWDC earlier this month, we’ve had the device pegged for a September announcement. For the September 7th rumor to be true, 1 of 2 things would have to happen.
* Apple would one: have to schedule an August event separate from their expected iPod event in September. Or two: they’d have to release the next iPhone on the day of or soon after its announcement.
* The first option just flat out doesn’t make sense. Why hold two separate media events less than a month apart? The second move doesn’t align with any of Apple’s previous iPhone launches. Typically the device is announced, followed by a media blitz, and then launch day.
* It’s more likely that we’ll hear an announcement around September 7th, a week or two of massive media coverage, and then a launch. Then again, Apple’s obviously doing a good job of keeping details about their next smartphone a secret, so we could all be way off.
* What do you think?
