* This is kind of interesting. Ferrari unveiled its latest hybrid supercar today, the “LaFerrari.” And not only does it come with support for Siri’s Eyes Free feature, it also includes two iPad minis for your passenger’s entertainment.
* But the automaker’s love for Apple runs even deeper than that. In addition to its new car, Ferrari also announced today that it plans to strengthen its partnership with the Cupertino company over the next several months…
* Here’s the report from Bloomberg (via 9to5Mac):
* “Ferrari SpA, the luxury carmaker owned by Fiat SpA (F), will be “more precise” about its partnership with Apple (AAPL) Inc. in the next few months, Chairman Luca Cordero Di Montezemolo said.
* Ferrari, which today unveiled the 1 million euro hybrid model “LaFerrari,” is in talks with Apple about broadening a partnership on in-car entertainment, Di Montezemolo said today at the Geneva motor show.”
* The news shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Apple has been wading deeper into the automative industry over the past several months with its Eyes Free invention, and it has a long history with the Fiat-owned supercar-maker.
* Last November, word surfaced that Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet Software & Services, had joined Ferrari’s Board of Directors. And earlier in the year, Ferrari’s CEO Luca di Montezemolo had a very public sit-down with Tim Cook.
* It’ll be interesting to see what Apple has planned for in-car entertainment. It’s long been interested in the auto industry, with Steve Jobs reportedly dreaming of building an iCar. And it has the resources to really make an impact.
* Thoughts?
