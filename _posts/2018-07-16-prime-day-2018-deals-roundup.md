* Looking for the best Prime Day deals? You’ve come to the right place! Below you’ll find a roundup of what we believe are the best discounts available today. This list will be updated frequently over the next two days with notable promotions from Amazon and other retailers on everything from Kindle e-readers to TV sets, and everything in between.
* Note: all of the Amazon Prime Day deals require a Prime membership. If you’re not a member, Amazon offers free 1-month trials for the service, or you can simply pay for a single month to take advantage of Prime Day ($12.99) and then cancel.
