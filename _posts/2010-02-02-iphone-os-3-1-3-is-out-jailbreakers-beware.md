* Apple released iPhone OS 3.1.3 just a few hours ago and it it is now available for download directly from iTunes or from our iPhone downloads page.
* This is a very minor update, and to be honest, it’s almost deceiving. If I had to give my opinion on this, I’d say that Apple released firmware 3.1.3 just to piss off the Dev Team, who released RedSn0w 3.1.2 jailbreak just days ago.
* The “fixes and improvements” for iPhone OS 3.1.3 are as follow:
* Additionally, Apple has updated the baseband from version 5.11.07 to 5.12.01 on the iPhone.
* As usual when a new firmware update is released, it is recommended for jailbreakers and unlockers alike not to update their device. If you update to 3.1.3, you will lose your jailbreak and/or unlock.
* More info will follow as it comes. For up-to-date news about jailbreaking, make sure to read our iPhone jailbreak section.
