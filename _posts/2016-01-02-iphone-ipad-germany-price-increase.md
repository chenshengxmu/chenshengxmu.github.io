* Apple has slightly raised prices of select iPhone and iPad models sold through its webstore in Germany in order to comply with new private copyright levies, as first reported by Apfelpage.de.
* The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 5s now each cost 5 euros more versus their December 31, 2015, prices on the Apple Online Store. iPad models such as the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad mini 4 and iPad mini 2 have increased in price by 8 euros for each model.
* As a result, the entry-level iPhone 6s with sixteen gigabytes of storage now costs 744.95 euros on the German Apple Online Store versus its previous asking price of 739 euros.
* The iPad Pro has gone from 899 euros to 907.33 euros for the entry-level model.

* These price increases meet demands of the new private copyright levies put forth by German trade associations Bitcom and ZPÜ, which requires smartphone and tablet makers to pay fees to sell recordable media devices for private and commercial use.
* ZPÜ, or the Central Organization for Private Recording Rights, connects the collecting societies that represent the legal interests of authors and copyright owners in Germany.
* Apple is a member of Bitcom and as such is subject to reduced rates in the amount of 5 euros for mobile phones and 7 euros for tablet devices.
