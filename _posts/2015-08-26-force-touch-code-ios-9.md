* Developer and noted iOS beta hacker Hamza Sood has discovered code relating to Force Touch in iOS 9. Sood tweeted out a screenshot of the code this evening, saying it appears Apple has been “testing keyboard trackpad gestures on the iPhone 6s, activated via Force Touch.”
* Given that the 6s is expected to be unveiled within the next few weeks, and believed to already be in mass production, it would seem the code all-but-confirms that the new iPhone will include Force Touch technology—a feature that already exists in MacBooks and Apple Watch.
* For those who aren’t familiar with Force Touch, it enables a device to sense how hard a user presses down on its screen. It’s been said that the feature will open the door for shortcuts, hidden menus and various other UI elements for both third-party and stock iPhone applications.

* Sood’s pseudo code is the latest in a growing stack of evidence that Apple’s next-gen handsets will include the technology. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple had begun production on Force Touch-iPhones, and reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since corroborated the story.
* Apple is believed to be planning an event for Wednesday, September 9, where it will present new iPhones, as well as a redesigned Apple TV and possibly new iPads. Earlier today, a report claimed that the event will be held in the massive Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, CA.
