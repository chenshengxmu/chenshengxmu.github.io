* The prolific leaker @EVLeaks last week tweeted out a pair of photos that show off Moga’s upcoming Made for iPhone (MFi) gaming controller.
* The leaker also mentioned that Moga has named its interesting accessory the Ace Power and says it’s the standard form-fitting variant which allows the iPhone to be docked itself right intro the gizmo.
* And now, eager iOS gamers get to finally see the accessory up close and personal in a nice leaked vid. I’ve included it below so have a look and meet us in comments…
* The clip was supposedly posted to YouTube by “accident,” but TouchArcade promptly made a copy before it got pulled and has re-posted it since.
* Here it is for your viewing pleasure.
* The Ace Power apparently has an integrated 1800mAh battery and sports dual thumbsticks, the traditional D-pad on the left, a set of buttons on the right and R1/R2 and L1/L2 shoulder buttons at the top.
* It should be compatible with the iPhone 5/5s/5c and the fifth-generation iPod touch and retail for $99 when it arrives later this year, around mid-November. The price point gave me a little pause given the Android version of Ace Power retails for $59.

* iOS exclusivity, much?
* Accessory maker Logitech is also working on its own MFi controller dubbed Powershell and other vendors such as ClamCase are hoping on the MFi gaming train as well.
* I’m very much looking forward to these physical controllers and am glad Apple finally gave developers frameworks to interact with these things and read the physical buttons, which was missing badly from Apple’s portable gaming strategy.
* I’m curious to hear from iOS gamers out there: will you be buying one of these beauties?
