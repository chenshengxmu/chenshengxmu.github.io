* Regional United States carriers C Spire and prepaid wireless operator Cricket Wireless will begin offering Apple’s latest iPhone 5 on Friday, September 28, it has been confirmed. Additionally, Alaska’s GCI, Bluegrass Cellular and Appalachian Wireless announced September 28 availability of the iPhone 5, a week after the device becomes available on AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint in the United States…
* Cricket Wireless, a prepaid subsidiary of Leap Wireless, announced in a media release that the iPhone 5 arrives in “select Cricket markets” on Friday, September 28. Cricket has more than six million subscribers and offers unlimited data plans with a monthly 2.3GB bandwidth cap.
* Another regional carrier, C Spire, also issued a release confirming September 28 launch. C Spire files as the first regional U.S. carrier that landed Apple’s phone last November. Neither carrier would reveal price points at post time.
* Cricket was the first United States carrier to land the prepaid iPhone 4/4S in June. At the time, Apple representative Natalie Harrison told The Loop that “by making iPhone available on pre-paid plans through Cricket Wireless, we are making the best smartphone more accessible to an even broader market in the US“.
* It would appear that Apple’s strategy of making “the best smartphone more accessible to an even broader market in the US” extends to the new iPhone 5.
* In addition to C Spire and Cricket, GCI of Alaska, Appalachian Wireless, Kentucky-based Bluegrass Cellular will also start selling the iPhone 5 on September 28.
* Techno Buffalo claimed in June that Irvine, California-headquartered Boost Mobile, a Sprint Nextel property, would be getting a prepaid iPhone “in early September” and we think they meant the iPhone 5.
* Because of the differences in LTE cellular radio technology from one carrier to another, Apple had to produce three carrier-specific versions of the iPhone 5. The device supports HSPA, HSPA+ and DC-HSDPA, in addition to 4G LTE and dual-band 802.11n wireless connectivity.

* With this news, we are expecting other regional carriers to land the iPhone soon. In addition, we also think Apple could/should offer the unlocked iPhone 5 via its online store as soon as the company starts accepting pre-orders for the device tomorrow.
* Initially, the iPhone 5 will launch in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore on September 21.
* The second phase of the global roll out will see the device arrive in an additional 22 countries on September 28: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
* The company plans to have the iPhone 5 available in a hundred countries by Christmas.
* The iPhone 5 comes in white & silver or black & slate in the same three storage configurations: 16GB, 32GB and 64GB for $199, $299, and $399 respectively, with a two-year contract.
* Are you excited about the expanded iPhone 5 availability?
