* With WWDC coming up on Monday, there’s only a few days left to speculate on what new goodies Apple will unveil. We know for sure that iOS 6 is on the menu, but what new features will the update bring?
* The consensus seems to be that, other than a number of revamped applications, Apple’s mobile OS will remain largely unchanged from its predecessor. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t dream big…
* MacStories points to an impressive new iOS concept from designer Joost van der Ree. The video is reminiscent of past works from Jan-Michael Cart, and includes tons of cool feature ideas. Check it out:
* Overall, it’s a really well thought-out concept. It seems like some of the features, namely the Mission Control concept, would be better suited on the iPad. But we’re really digging the Dynamic Badges idea.
* In the end, these features all seem more than a tad bit too ambitious for Apple — especially for iOS 6. But here’s hoping they’re at least taking notes for future iterations.
* What do you think of the concept?
