* iPhone X became available to preorder today at 12:01am PT and Apple has now issued a statement to the media noting “off the charts” customer response to the handset.
* Here’s Apple’s statement in full, via TechCrunch:
* We are thrilled to be taking orders for iPhone X, the future of the smartphone.
* We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts. We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.
* We will keep accepting orders online and iPhone X will be available at Apple retail stores on Friday, November 3 starting at 8am, as well as from our carrier and retailer partners around the world.
* The company does not break down iPhone sales by model and it no longer reports opening weekend iPhone sales. We’ll have a better idea of how well the new phone is performing when Apple’s September quarter earnings are reported on November 2.
* Only a few days of preorders will be counted in the report.
* Apple said earlier this week that it will have iPhone X for walk-in customers when the handset hits store shelves next Friday, but advised would-be buyers to “arrive early”.
* After just a few minutes of preorders going live, shipments slipped into December.
* iPhone X will be available from November 3 in stores in these countries:
* Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Japan, Jersey, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, UK, US and US Virgin Islands.
