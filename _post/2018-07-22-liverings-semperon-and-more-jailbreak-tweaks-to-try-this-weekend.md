* The Electra Team has so much going on as of late that it feels like the jailbreak community is experiencing a revitalizing rebirth. And for anyone who likes installing jailbreak tweaks, that’s excellent news.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from July 16th to July 22nd. As usual, we’ll discuss our favorite ones first and then outline the rest afterward.

* With a free jailbreak tweak called LiveRings, you can experience an Activity app icon that displays your real-time ring progress right inside of the app’s Home screen icon.
* While purely cosmetic, the effect can also save time by letting you see your activity progress without opening the app.
* You can learn more about LiveRings and why it’s a great addition to jailbroken handsets in our full review.

* Several Android handsets come out of the box with ‘always-on-display’ technology, in which the screen turns dark with nothing more than a time indicator in the center. Now, with a jailbreak tweak called Semperon, you can have this on your iPhone too.
* Semperon works on OLED and LCD-equipped devices and includes anti-screen burn-in techniques to protect your display from being on for too long.
* You can configure the tweak to show more than just the time, such as your Status Bar, notification alerts, and more.
* You can learn more about Semperon and how it can supercharge your iOS experience in our full review.
