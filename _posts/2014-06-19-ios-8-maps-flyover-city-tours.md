* There’s a nicely done new Apple Maps feature hidden in iOS 8 Beta 2. Called City Tours, it’s basically a set of manually programmed and scripted virtual tours of select major cities, rendered and animated in Maps’ three-dimensional Flyover mode.
* Apple hasn’t talked about City Tours during its WWDC keynote (aside from a brief mention on one slide) and the feature couldn’t be found on the official iOS 8 webpage, in WWDC session videos or inside Apple’s official developer documentation…
* Fortunately, these virtual tours can be enabled manually on devices running iOS 8 Beta 2 and developer Pierre Blasquez has been able to accomplish just that.
* As first noted by MacRumors editor Eric Slivka, Blasquez partnered with Mac4Ever [Google Translate] to publish a video showing an example City Tour of Paris.
* He was also able to unlock City Tours for several other cities, like Rome, Stockholm, Barcelona, ​​New York, Paris, Glasgow, Cape Town, Perth, Bordeaux and the San Francisco Bay. We expect the list to grow after iOS 8 makes its landfall in Fall.
* Google Maps/Earth have long had similar virtual tours of major points of interests so it goes without saying that adding City Tours to iOS 8 Maps is a smart move.
* Hopefully, it’s not among the Maps features Apple’s reportedly put on the back burner.
* What do you think of Maps’ City Tours?
