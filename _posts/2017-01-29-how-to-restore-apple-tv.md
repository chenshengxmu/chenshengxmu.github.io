* With all the excitement of the beta jailbreak for iOS 10.2, the Apple TV has (as usual) fallen somewhat by the wayside. However, whilst there has been no definite news concerning a jailbreak for the device, there have been some tentative stirrings suggesting it could be a possibility in the future.
* Whilst I wouldn’t take that as gospel at this point, it might be worth non-jailbroken Apple TV 4 users downgrading now from tvOS 10.1.1 to 10.1 just in case. Check out my comprehensive advice guide for more details if you’re not sure whether this applies to you.
* This guide will walk you through how to restore any generation of Apple TV. The process comes in handy for upgrading and downgrading to signed firmwares, but also for restoring the device if it has problems or needs a fresh start.
* 1) Visit our downloads page to grab the IPSW file for the firmware you want.
* 2) Disconnect all the wires from your Apple TV. Then connect your Apple TV to your computer via Micro-USB or USB-C.
* 3) Connect the power cable to your Apple TV.
* 4) Launch iTunes and wait for the device to appear on the connected devices page. As you can see, mine began the process on tvOS 9.0.
* If iTunes doesn’t recognize your Apple TV, you might have to put it in recovery mode.

* 5) Locate the Restore Apple TV… button.
* 6a) If you are on Windows hold down the shift key, and then click the Restore Apple TV… button.
* 6b) If you are on Mac hold down the option/alt key, and then click the Restore Apple TV… button.
* 7) A file browser should now appear. Navigate to the IPSW firmware file which you downloaded earlier, and select it.

* 8) At the confirmation dialogue which appears, check that it reports the correct firmware version to restore to, and then hit Restore.

* 9) Your Apple TV will now begin the restore process. Do not disconnect it from the computer, or from power, until it is complete.

* 10) Once the restore is complete the following message will appear: Your Apple TV has been restored to factory settings. Please disconnect your Apple TV from your computer and reconnect it to your TV.

* 11) Check your tvOS version in iTunes to ensure that it has restored to the correct firmware. As you can see, mine is now at tvOS 10.1.

* And there you have it! This method can clear the dust and cobwebs from an Apple TV which has been running for a while. It can also upgrade or downgrade it to a higher/lower signed firmware if you want to move between them.
* Have you downgraded your Apple TV 4 to tvOS 10.1 in the hopes of yalu102 supporting it? Have you ever needed to restore your Apple TV at all?
