* Apple could cash in to the tune of $100 million soon after it unveils upcoming devices with the new 9-pin dock connector. The Cupertino, Calif. company intends to be initially the only game in town for Apple fans, exclusively selling the adapters at $10 a pop, reports say.
* The company will also sell Apple-branded USB cables for $19 each. This is in line with the MagSafe to Magasafe 2 converter cable Apple sells for $9.99 and the iPhone Micro USB adapter for $11 and $13.
* According to iLounge, the new Dock Connector Adapter will sell for $10 each or $29 for a pack of three. The company should rake in $100 million by selling 10 million of the adapters by the end of 2012, the publication writes. Developers are worried Apple has stopped approving third-party connectors, fearing the firm will pull another MagSafe episode.
* The MagSafe connector for the MacBook was jealously guarded by Apple, which used lawsuits and restrictive licensing to protect the add-on revenue stream for less expensive alternatives.
* Apple is expected to announce its new iPhone 5 and potentially other products on Sept. 12.
* What do you think? Is Apple trying to shut-out third-party developers from the rush to adapt existing hardware?
