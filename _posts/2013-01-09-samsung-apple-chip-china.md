* Samsung is preparing for the day Apple – its rival and largest customer – stops placing orders with the South Korean corporation. Ahead of a CES keynote speech, a Samsung executive said it is looking to court Chinese smartphone makers which use the company’s own Exynos-branded chips.
* After a string of contentious court battles, Apple is planning to untangle itself from Samsung, finding new suppliers. Although Apple is expected to spend $80 billion with Samsung for everything from CPUs, flash memory and flat screens, the paycheck could shrink 80 percent by 2017, according to a Wall Street analysis…
* Stephen Woo, Samsung’s president for the unit making Apple processors, told Reuters Wednesday:
* As there are just two smartphone makers that are doing really well, chipmakers supplying them have grown in tandem. So we plan to bolster our relationship with those key customers.
* Among those key customers may be two Chinese smartphone makers. China’s Meizu and LePhone-maker Lenovo both use Samsung’s Exynos quad-core processor. Today at CES, the South Korean conglomerate announced a new eight-core mobile processor. Of note, Bill Clinton was in attendance of the news conference.
* Dubbed the Exynos 5 Octa, it has four Cortex-A15 cores and four Cortex-A7 cores, switching between them to handle common workloads while providing better battery life. It also boasts twice the 3D performance of any previous mobile processor, including Samsung’s previous Exynos 4 Quad. The fourth-generation iPad uses the Apple-designed A6X processor with three GPU cores and two ARM Cortex-A15 CPU cores.

* Samsung’s comments come amid more talk Apple is moving its mobile processor business. Earlier this month, a report surfaced suggesting the iPhone maker would use TSMC for its A6x processor.
* Apple has outsourced all of its mobile chip manufacturing to Samsung, which produces iPhone, iPod and iPad processors according to its blueprints in the highly sophisticated $14 billion Austin, Texas facility, pictured below.

* Speculation also arose that Apple plans to build a chip plant in Austin, Texas, perhaps in connection to CEO Tim Cook’s pledge to produce a Mac in the United States.
* The Reuters article also notes Samsung is looking to diversify from simply offering mobile processors. The company recently purchased the UK-based CSR Plc for its cell phone modem and baseboard chip knowledge.
* Currently, Qualcomm has 50 percent of the mobile baseband market – an area that could be attractive for a firm seeing its biggest customer walking away.
