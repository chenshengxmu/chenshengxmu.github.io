* PayPal is dropping support for its mobile apps on Windows, BlackBerry and Kindle Fire devices, the online payments firm announced in a blog post. Existing users will be required to upgrade to the latest version of the mobile PayPal app for iOS and Android, which in February received its long-overdue makeover. Starting on June 3 through June 30, those on older versions of the PayPal mobile app must upgrade to the latest version, 6.0.
* June 30 will be the last day for Windows Phone, BlackBerry and Amazon Kindle Fire users to access their PayPal apps, cautioned the firm.
* “It was a difficult decision to no longer support the PayPal app on these mobile platforms, but we believe it’s the right thing to ensure we are investing our resources in creating the very best experiences for our customers,“ explained the company.

* Of course, Windows, Kindle and BlackBerry users can continue to access PayPal features through the mobile interface on the web. Outlook.com users can also use the PayPal add-in to send money directly from their inbox while Blackberry users can continue using the BBM app to send peer-to-peer payments via PayPal.
* The latest version of the revamped PayPal app supports features like sending and requesting money, checking your PayPal balance and browsing transaction history.
* PayPal 6.0 requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.1 and is available at no charge via the App Store.
