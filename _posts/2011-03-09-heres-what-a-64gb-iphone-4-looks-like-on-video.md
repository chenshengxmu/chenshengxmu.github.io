* A couple of days ago we reported on a story revolving around a mysterious 64GB iPhone 4 that seemed to have sprung out of nowhere.
* Initial reports around the web indicated that the device was being sold on the grey markets in China.
* Now a bit of clarification has been added to the mix, as it appears that this iPhone 4 is one of maybe a few prototypes that “leaked” out of Foxconn facilities.
* As you can see, the iPhone 4 definitely reeks of being a prototype. Notice that the + and – signs on the volume keys are nowhere to be found.
* This device looks eerily similar to the iPhone 4 that Gizmodo acquired last year from a guy that left his prototype iPhone 4 lying helplessly in a bar.
* Another point of note is that the silver ring that surrounds the camera lens in production iPhone 4’s is missing as well. That too is a feature identical to the iPhone 4 shown off by Gizmodo.

* Judging from the similarities, I’m going to go on the limb as call this a pre-production iPhone 4 that just happened to find its way outside of Foxconn’s walls. I highly doubt we’ll ever see an iPhone 4 with 64GB of storage, but it’s definitely possible for the iPhone 5.
* The good news is that Apple is indeed testing such storage capabilities, so at least they are contemplating it.
* What do you think?
