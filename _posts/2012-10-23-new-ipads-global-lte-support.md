* Both of Apple’s new tablets it introduced today — the iPad mini and the 4th generation iPad — come in a Wi-Fi + Cellular option that features an LTE chip for ultra fast wireless internet access.
* And unlike with the third generation iPad, these two tablets will work on LTE networks around the world. In fact, Apple says that 19 carriers in 9 countries will support the 4G slates at launch…
* As spotted by MacRumors, Apple has posted a new page showing 19 carriers in 9 countries that the iPad mini and the 4th generation iPad will work with at launch time. In no particular order:
* United States
* Canada
* Germany
* United Kingdom
* Australia
* Japan
* Korea
* Hong Kong
* Singapore
* The extensive list of international carrier support is a good sign after Apple’s fumble with LTE earlier this year. The third generation iPad only supported the 4G tech in the United States and Canada.
* It’s also nice to see Sprint finally on this list. As we told you earlier, Sprint announced this afternoon that it would be carrying LTE versions of both the fourth generation iPad and the iPad mini.
