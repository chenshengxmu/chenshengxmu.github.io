* Apple and GT are continuing their work to strengthen sapphire, according to a new report from Wall Street Forensics. The site says the pair are hoping to reduce the material’s “fundamental flaw of cracking,” as well as improve its reflective properties.
* On September 18th, the US Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that covers new processes to both aid in the strengthening of sapphire, and cut manufacturing costs—a major point of contention with sapphire critics.
* Here are a few highlights from the patent:
* In the months leading up to the iPhone 6 event, several rumors called for the new handset to feature sapphire screen covers, but obviously they never materialized. We’ve heard various reasons why, but it sounds like the gist is the material just wasn’t ready.
* That doesn’t mean we won’t ever see sapphire iPhone screens though. Apple didn’t build a large factory in Arizona to make camera lenses and Watch covers, and looking at initial iPhone 6 drop tests, current screen cover tech is long overdue for an overhaul.
