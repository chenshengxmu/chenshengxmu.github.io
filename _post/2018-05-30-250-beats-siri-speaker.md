* Has price kept you from buying a HomePod? At what price point would you consider ditching Google or Amazon and buying a smart speaker from Apple? What about $250? That’s the price one Apple analyst predicts Apple will charge for a new Beats-branded speaker that could be announced at next week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). 
* On Tuesday, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster offered predictions about next week’s WWDC keynote address. Among them is the introduction of a $250 Beats-branded “option” that sounds a lot like a new speaker.
* As he explains:
* Siri integration with Beats. The knock on HomePod is its $349 price is about 2-3x the price of a typical smart speaker. We believe Apple can advance its digital assistant ambitions with a $250 Beats-branded option that does not compromise HomePod’s $349 price point. We are currently modeling for HomePod to have a low-to-mid teens digital assistant market share, and this Beats integration does not change our market share outlook.
* Apple’s Beats currently sells a Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker for $179.99. Add this to the $349 HomePod, and it makes sense solely from a pricing tier perspective for the company to introduce a $250 Siri-based speaker. However, I’m not convinced this is the way to go.
* Because of the convenience they provide, smart speakers are intended to be in multiple rooms in a home. Manufacturers not named Apple get this and have priced their products accordingly with most of today’s smart speakers priced at well below $150. The top-selling Amazon Echo, for example, is $99, while the popular Google Home is $129. Both of these speakers are often on sale which brings their prices down even further at certain times of the year.
* Unlike those other speakers, Apple’s HomePod has always been sold as a premium device. Accordingly, it comes at a premium price, just like other Apple products.
* If Apple’s serious about gaining market share in the growing smart speaker market, it should release a next-generation Beats Pill with Siri-compatibility. And yes, for around $179, not $250. Just last week, we heard Apple was prepping to announce a $199 Siri-based Beats-branded speaker at WWDC. This makes a lot more sense, no?
* What say you? Is $250 the sweet spot for a lower-priced Siri-based smart speaker? How much would you be willing to spend? Leave your comments below.
