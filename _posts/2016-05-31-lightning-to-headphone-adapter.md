* Apple is widely believe to remove the more than century-old 3.5mm analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 in favor of Lightning-enabled headphones and wireless Bluetooth headsets. Chinese vendor Tama Electric is advertising at Computex 2016 in Taipei the first Lightning-to-headphone that would let folks connect their existing analog headphones based on the 3.5mm audio jack to the iPhone 7.
* The listing was first discovered by the oft-reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara.
* The Lightning-to-3.5mm-audio adapter, appears to be MFi-certified (it’s more likely that it’s being prepared for certification) and is rather bulky in appearance.
* It has a male Lightning connector on one end and the standard 3.5mm audio jack on the other, with built-in volume up/down controls and the power switch. These products are not available for purchase yet and have no price tag attached them.
* Vendors often build iPhone accessories based on rumors in the hope of being first to market when the new handset releases. Putting aside for a moment the fact that this particular vendor is actively advertising its unsanctioned accessory, it very existence offers a sign of things to come provided the rumors are true.
* If the 3.5mm audio jack is really going to be ditched on the iPhone 7, Apple will likely include a wired, Lightning-based edition of its EarPods in the box, with a wireless, Bluetooth-driven version of the headphones likely to be an optional purchase.
* Apple could also drop a 16GB SKU from the iPhone 7 lineup, replacing it with a 32GB base model, and is said to be moving to a three-year iPhone refresh cycle, abandoning the tic-tock cycle that has served it so well in years past.
