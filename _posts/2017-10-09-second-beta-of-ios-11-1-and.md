* Apple on Monday seeded the second betas of upcoming updates including iOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1, tvOS 11.1 and macOS 10.13.1. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism. 
* Beta 2 brings about new emoji from Unicode 10—including face vomiting, exploding head, crazy face, pie and much more. It also appears that beta 2 restores 3D Touch app switching. We’ll of course be checking for any other notable changes, but in the meantime check out our video on what was new in beta 1.

* Upon first glance, there doesn’t appear to be any significant changes in beta 2 for watchOS 4.1. The first beta, as you may recall, brought about a new Radio app and support for streaming Apple Music over LTE for Apple Watch Series 3 owners.
* We haven’t seen any major changes in the first or second betas of tvOS 11.1, suggesting that the update is more focused on under-the-hood performance improvements and bug fixes.
* Similarly, macOS 10.13.1 seems to be more aimed at performance improvements and bug fixes. However, like iOS 11.1, this update will also bring bout the new Unicode 10 emoji.
* Poll time: what are you more excited for in iOS 11.1?
