* As expected, the new iPhone 5s features a significantly upgraded rear-facing iSight camera. It has a new five-element Apple-designed lens with an F2.2 aperture and a 15% larger active sensor area. The pixels are larger too:—1.5 microns.
* The camera software has also been largely improved. The Camera app now sets white balance, exposure, and creates a “dynamic local tone map” with “autofocus matrix metering” for 15 zones—all automatically. More details after the fold…

* The camera also now features something called “True tone flash.” Unsurprisingly, there are two LEDs—one cool and white, the other is warm and amber. And software can combine the two to get the right color balance.
* Speaking of software, auto image stabilization is now available in the camera. And the way it works is that it will take multiple photos, combine them for light levels, and then pick the sharpest one to display.

* Slow-motion video is also in the cards. As the above slide shows, the new camera will be capable of shooting video of up to 120 fps (or frames per second), as well as HD video at 720p. And that’s the new iSight camera.
