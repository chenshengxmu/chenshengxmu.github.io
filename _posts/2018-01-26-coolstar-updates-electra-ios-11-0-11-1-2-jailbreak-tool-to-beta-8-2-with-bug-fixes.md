* It was just yesterday that CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 got updated to beta 8, but many users reported bugs and using it – predominantly with Safari. Fortunately, Electra beta 8-2 launched on Friday with a fix for these issues, among other things.
* Just like the LiberiOS jailbreak tool that got released last year, Electra utilizes Ian Beer’s open-source tfp0 exploit. Furthermore, it doesn’t install Cydia, as Saurik has yet to update it for iOS 11 devices.
* Citing the official website, Electra beta 8-2 includes the following changes:
* Many have purportedly used Electra to jailbreak their iOS 11 device(s) without any issues, but as always, we recommend waiting for Saurik to update some of the community’s core tools for iOS 11 before proceeding, such as Cydia and Mobile Substrate to name a few.
* Electra currently relies on an implementation of jailbreakd for installing tweaks, and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11 is supposed to ditch jailbreakd in place of a more efficient and stable dyld-hooking mechanism.
* It’s unclear whether Electra will support the updated Mobile Substrate when it gets released, so we advise all novice jailbreakers to refrain from use until we get the official word from Saurik. You can certainly ignore our advice and move forward with Electra anyway, but you do so at your own risk.
