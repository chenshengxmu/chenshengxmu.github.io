* Given its popularity, it sure as well took long enough, but Spotify has finally been updated with support for iOS 7. The update brings a subtle yet certainly noticeable redesign that incorporates flatter textures, and divided search and browse sections.
* Spotify’s release notes were a bit ambiguous, stating that the app was “now compatible with iOS 7.” Since compatibility doesn’t necessarily guarantee any sort of redesign, I wasn’t really expecting much.
* Thankfully, Spotify’s definition of “compatible” goes beyond the codebase and encompasses the look and feel of the app as well. You’ll quickly notice new visual cues, which provide a more cohesive look alongside iOS 7.

* As mentioned above, Spotify’s sidebar has encountered a bit of a redesign. Gone are the combined Search and Browse fields in favor of a segregated pair of fields, which should add to the app’s simplicity and ease of use.
* I think Spotify made a good move here, because people who are searching generally want only one thing — search. People who want to browse need more guidance. I think that combining the fields confused a lot of people in the past, so this is a welcomed addition.

* You’ll notice that the scrubber knob is a bit bigger in the new Spotify. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test out the various hit points to ensure that it made for a more functionally sound scrubbing experience, but the bigger size should, at the least, provided the perception of better feedback with your thumbs.
* Again, there are all sorts of subtle design changes in the new Spotify. Nothing about it will really pop out as a major improvement, but all of the changes add up for a better experience, and most certainly a better look.
* Head over to the App Store right now, and you’ll be able to find Spotify 0.8.0 ringing in at a healthy 38.6 MB. Be sure to let us know what you think about the iOS 7 redesign in the comment section below.
