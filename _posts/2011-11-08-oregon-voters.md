* Not even Apple could have foreseen the impact its tablet would have across multiple industries. Health, education, enterprise, music — they’ve all been affected in one way or another by the popular slate. In fact, iPads are slowly replacing computers in public schools.
* Now it appears that the iPad is set to take on another field. Politics. According to Yahoo News, Apple’s tablet is going to be taking a key part in a special primary election in Oregon today to replace former US Representative David Wu…
* The voting will take place in 5 Oregon counties throughout the day, and according to Yahoo, iPads will be on-hand for voters with disabilities. The tablets will accommodate users with poor eyesight and dexterity, ensuring that everyone gets a vote.
* Although voters will be using the iPads to cast their decisions, the ballots will still need to be sent in on paper. So once a form is completed, it will be printed out. Then nearby Election Officials will collect it and prepare it for processing.
* The program is still in the pilot stage, but could end up being implemented state-wide. Oregon is obviously interested in the project, as it has reportedly spent over $75,000 developing tablet-specific software. Apple is also said to be involved, donating 5 iPads to the cause.
* It’s interesting that whenever a state or government launches a tablet program, the iPad always seems to be at the forefront.
