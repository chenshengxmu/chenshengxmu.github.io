title: Its Official, Verizon Will Not Have the iPhone Anytime Soon
---
* How many times did I tell you that Verizon wouldn’t have the iPhone this year? One? Two? Actually more than that but I’m not going to link to every article about it.
* Verizon spokesperson John Johnson told Beet.tv that there is no plan for Verizon to support the Apple mobile devices, in the “immediate future”.
* Now we can play on the semantics of “immediate future” but to me it means, not this year, and probably not even next year. So forget all those unfounded rumors saying Verizon is testing the iPhone 4G or even the iPad on its network.
* Again, Apple has a contract with AT&T to be the exclusive carrier for 5 years (there’s another 2 to go) and according to Steve Jobs recent interview at D8 Conference, both Apple and AT&T have been doing quite well: “AT&T took a big leap on us and decided they were going to trust us to do the right thing with the phone. And that’s worked out quite well for both of us.”
* What does that mean? That means that whether you like it or not, Apple is sticking with AT&T and Verizon may have the iPhone in 2 years. But remember, Verizon is a CDMA network. CDMA is a dying technology and Apple is not used to betting on dying species, if you see what I mean…
* How do you feel about that? Disappointed?
