* Filippo Bigarella has pushed the latest update for Springtomize 3 to Cydia, and it’s a doozy. The update brings loads of bug fixes, but it also adds new features like lock animations, new app switcher features to handle the look of inactive apps, new Barrel-like scroll animations, and more.
* Springtomize 3 is one of the best tweaks for iOS 7, and with this latest 1.1 update, it only gets better. Have a look at our new video, which showcases some of Springtomize 3’s new features—including all two-dozen plus scroll animations—after the jump.
* You can access the new scroll animations and lock animations from the Animations section in the Springtomize 3 preferences.
