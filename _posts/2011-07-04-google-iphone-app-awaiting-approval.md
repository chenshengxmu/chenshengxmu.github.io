* Everyone’s been Buzzing [pardon my pun] about Google’s latest social product, Google+. Many people have been a fan of it – at least the ones who got invited, that is – but us iPhone users had to wait just a bit to get our hands on an official Google+ app. Google initially made the app Android only (naturally), with iPhone users having to use a mobile web client that worked rather well.
* Today, however, Google employee Erica Joy posted on her Google+ page: “For my iPhone using friends: the Google+ iPhone app has been submitted to the App store (no not today, sometime prior to today) and is awaiting approval.”
* This means that any day now, the app will become available in the App Store. That is, of course, if Apple approves it. Hopefully it doesn’t (and shouldn’t, quite frankly), follow the path of Google Voice, which made it to the App Store a year after it was initially submitted.
* We can’t wait to get our hands on the iPhone app, which will definitely enhance the experiece of using Google+ on the iPhone. By the way, for those of you who got in, how are you liking Google+ so far? Let us know!
