* Samsung has announced that it will be unveiling the next version of its Galaxy Note handset on August 2nd. The company sent out a press release on Tuesday, saying that it will be hosting an Unpacked event in New York, scheduled to begin at 11 am (EDT).
* On August 2nd, Samsung Electronics will unveil the Galaxy Note7.
* With added functionality of the S Pen and large screen, the Galaxy Note7 is a powerful instrument for achievement and self-expression, and is made for those who want to get the most from their phones – and their lives. Galaxy Note7 will help people do more in work, at home and everywhere in between. We can’t wait to tell you more about it!
* So why the Note 7 instead of the Note 6? Samsung says the move will better unify its product portfolio— S7 and S7 Edge—and minimize confusion about its latest mobile technology. Also keep in mind that Apple is expected to launch its iPhone 7 in September.
* Both the S7 and S7 Edge have been selling well for Samsung, and the Note has always been a popular line for the company, so it’ll be interesting to see what they’ve cooked up this year. As usual, we will be watching the event and providing a recap of the highlights.
