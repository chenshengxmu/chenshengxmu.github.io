* Apple is ramping up its spat with Samsung, according to reports, with the company seeking a preliminary injunction on four of Samsung’s top pieces of hardware. Three Android smartphones and one Android tablet are named by Apple as violating their patents, and the lawyers from Cupertino want all four devices yanked from store shelves.
* The Infuse 4G, Galaxy S 4G, Droid Charge, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 are all named by Apple’s crack legal team and if they get their wicked way, we could see four of Samsung’s newest releases pulled from sale….
* According to patent site, FOSS Patents, four patents are mentioned by Apple in its request.
* Apple asserts the following four intellectual property rights — three design patents and one utility patent:
* This is dangerous territory for Apple to be stumbling through. While it’s true that a victory here would mean some Samsung smartphones and a tablet would be removed from sale, the possibility of a negative result in court is a real one.
* If things don’t go their way, Apple runs the risk of their overarching feud with Samsung being dealt a potentially lethal blow.
* Clearly the legal boffins Apple keeps in a dark, Cupertino room feel that this is the best course of action to take in the ingoing Apple Vs Samsung debacle – a debacle that shows no sign of ending any time soon!
