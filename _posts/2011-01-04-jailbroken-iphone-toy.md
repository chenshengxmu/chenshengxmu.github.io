* Forgot to buy your kid a gift for Christmas? Don’t have more than a dollar to spend? This amazing smartphone might just be the perfect present for your spoiled little kido. This is not a just any toy. It is what seems to be a mix between the iPhone and some kind of Android phone.
* Best of all, you may have noticed the little Cydia icon on the toy’s screen. Whoever designed this is must be a serious jailbreak aficionado.
