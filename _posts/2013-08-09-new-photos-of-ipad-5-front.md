* Back in January of this year, iLounge’s Jeremy Horwitz claimed to have seen a physical model of the fifth generation iPad. He said it was “a lot smaller than one would guess was possible” with “virtually no left or right bezels.”
* Since then, all of the reports and part leaks we’ve seen have corroborated Horwitz’ description. We’ve seen rear shells of the tablet—more than once—and a few cases, and today we have new pictures of a black front panel…
* MacRumors points to repair shop MacFixit’s website, which has posted several photos of what it believes is a front panel and digitizer for the iPad 5. The part shows the same narrower side bezels as we’ve seen in previous leaks.

* The site notes that the connectors are different from those seen in current and previous iPad models, but Apple has been rumored to be making a number of internal changes in order to achieve the smaller form factor expected.
* Here are some of the other things it noted:
* – The display area is the same as the iPad Retina.  – The edges of the frame are narrower using the same style as the iPad mini.  – The ITO (Indium tin oxide) is the same as the iPad mini.  – There is now 2 connectors instead of 1.  – The connectors have been changed from FFC (Flat Flexible Cable, like the iPad 2/3/4) to FPC (Flexible Printed Circuits, like the iPhone 4/5).
* Given the amount of evidence that’s piled up, we’re fairly confident we have a good idea of what the next iPad is going to look like. As far as the internals, though, we don’t know much outside of a hunch that it’ll feature an A7 chip.
* Apple is expected to unveil its fifth generation iPad as early as next month, alongside a new iPad mini and other product refreshes.
