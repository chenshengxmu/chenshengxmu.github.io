* Spotify, the #1 music streaming service, today announced a new playlist updated daily with tracks that users mark as favorites as well as new music.
* Now available in the updated mobile Spotify app for iOS and Android, Daily Mix differs from Spotify’s existing Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists which get refreshed each Monday and Friday, respectively, in that Daily Mix won’t be a complete refresh of songs each time the playlist is updated.
* “Daily Mix is trying to take the work out of hitting a button and always hearing music that you love,” said Matt Ogle, who helps lead development of music discovery and personalization at Spotify.
* Spotify defines Daily Mix as a series of playlists with “near endless playback that combines your favorite tracks with new songs we think you’ll love,” made fresh in continuously updated playlists.
* The more you listen, the better your Mixes will become. The playlist is based entirely on your personal listening habits. You can remove any tracks you don’t like from future refreshes. If you “heart” a song in Daily Mix, Spotify will add it to your collection.
* Your personal Daily Mix is available in your library through the latest version of the Spotify app. Daily Mix is available globally to all existing users, both free and premium.
* New users will be able to access Daily Mix after approximately two weeks of listening.
* Daily Mixes will be rolling out to additional platforms soon.
* Apple Music in June 2016 launched the weekly updated My Favorites Mix playlist, later renamed to My New Music Mix. Last month, Apple Music gained another weekly updated playlist, My Favorites Mix.
* Spotify for iOS is available at no charge in the App Store.
