* Although not apparently obvious, Apple’s Reminders app on iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Mac and iCloud.com lets you share to-dos and checklists with friends and family.
* Sharing a reminder list with, say, your girlfriend (or wife) is particularly convenient as you’ll both be able to add, delete and check off items as completed, and all changes will instantly appearing on everyone’s devices thanks to seamless iCloud syncing.
* This isn’t just great for grocery lists, shared to-dos and interactive lists among family members, but for business, too. For example, you could share a to-do list with team members to keep everyone apprised of what needs to be done on any particular day.
* In this post, we’re going to show how easy it is to create a list in Reminders and invite others to participate across iOS, OS X and the web.
* You first need to created a remider list before sharing. Fire up Apple’s Reminders app on your iOS device and pull down with your finger to reveal the search field at the top.

* Step 3: Type the email addresses or names of all the people you want to share with.
* Step 4: Click Done to finish.
* To stop sharing a list, do the following:
* If you no longer need the shared list, you can safely delete it which effectively stops sharing it with all participants and removes the list from all devices and iCloud.
* If you no longer want to participate in a shared reminder list, unsubscribe to it by deleting it: select the list you wish to remove and press the Delete or Backspace key (or click the Details button, then click Delete in the Details pop-up window) on OS X and iCloud, or tap Edit → Delete List on iOS.
* All of the reminders in the list are also deleted.
* All invitees will receive an email invitation and a notification that must be accepted before they can view and edit your shared list.
* If one or more of your invitees have not received an email invitation or a notification to join a shared reminder list, do the following:
* Only the list owner can resend invitations. You cannot resend invitations using Reminders for iOS.
* To add a participant to a shared list, or remove one, do the following:
* You can create, edit, view and share reminder lists from any computer or device set up with iCloud, using:
* With iCloud set up on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac, edits and changes are pushed to the Reminders app on iOS, OS X and iCloud. On a Windows computer with iCloud for Windows installed, changes appear as tasks in Microsoft Outlook.
* If you use the Family Sharing feature, all members of your family automatically share a reminder list called Family. You can add reminders to it and they will appear in the shared reminder list on everyone’s devices.
* Before you can starting using the family’s shared reminder list, you must first join a family. All family members are automatically added to the Family reminder list and can’t be removed from it except by leaving or being removed from the family.
* To help iCloud do its work, keep your items within the following limits:
* Up-to-date limits for Reminders, Calendars, Contacts and Bookmarks can be found in Apple’s support document.
* No, reminder notifications aren’t shared with others and this is by design. When you set a reminder to go off at a time or place, it won’t ping anyone else on your shared list. To share an event with an alert that will ping everyone’s devices, create a shared calendar in the Calendar app and add an event with an alert to it.
* Yes, you can. To automatically put new reminders on your shared list, set your default reminder list to your shared list by selecting Reminders → Default List on OS X, or Settings → Reminders on iOS. Now choose a default list for new reminders.
* To keep reminders up to date on all devices, you must use iCloud:
* Although some other types of accounts, such as Exchange, also support Reminders (you can go to Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars and turn on Reminders for the accounts you wish to use), you can only share reminders list with other iCloud users.
