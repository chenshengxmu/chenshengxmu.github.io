* Hot on the heels of this morning’s release of AdWords Express, Google has launched another new app for iOS. It’s called YouTube Creator Studio, and it’s a one-stop shop for YouTube creators to access information on their channels and videos.
* The app provides quick access to video analytics, comment moderation tools, notifications and even YouTube’s Video Manager that’s found on the desktop site. Here, you have the ability to edit video information like titles, descriptions, and tags…
* From the iTunes description:
* The official YouTube Creator Studio app makes it faster and easier to manage your channel on the go. Check out your latest stats, respond to comments, and get customized notifications so you can stay connected from anywhere.
* * Monitor channel and video performance with easy-to-use analytics * Filter and respond to fan comments * Customize push notifications so you can stay on top of what you care about most * Update your video details and settings

* As you can imagine, this app won’t do you much good unless you’re fairly active in the YouTube community. For those that are, though, this new tool will really come in handy. You can find YouTube Creator Studio in the App Store for free.
