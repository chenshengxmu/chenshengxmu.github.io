* Have a new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? The first thing you’re going to want to do—unless you don’t care about scratches or abrasions—is find a case for it. And if you’re like me, you don’t want some big bulky case. You want something ultra-thin that won’t get in the way.
* So we’ve put together a list of several great ultra-thin cases for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These obviously aren’t the only available cases for Apple’s new handsets, but we picked these specifically based on personal experience, user feedback, features and pricing.

* We are of course big Spigen fans here at iDB so we love their Air Skin Case for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It features a hard polypropylene skin, that measures just 0.36mm thick, and a semi-transparent frost finish so you can still see the handset’s beautiful design. Covers all edges, with openings for the buttons, and comes in both clear and black colorways.
* You can buy this Spigen Air Skin case for the iPhone 7 for $15.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $14.99.

* Spigen also has a thin hard case for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus called the Thin Fit. Made of a hard polycarbonate, it’s lightweight and has openings on the top, sides and bottom so it doesn’t obscure buttons or other features. This particular case comes in all 5 iPhone 7 colorways, including matte Black and Jet Black, so you can match it to your handset.
* You can buy the Spigen Thin Fit case for iPhone 7 for $9.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $10.99.

* I know, I know, another Spigen case. But one of the company’s strengths is getting quality products to market quickly. This is their Liquid Crystal case, and it measures just 1.3mm thin. It’s made of clear TPU, so it’s lightweight, flexible and extremely durable, and it has a raised lip for added screen protection. The buttons are covered, and an inner dot pattern prevents rear smudges.
* You can buy this Liquid Crystal Clear case for iPhone 7 for $9.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $11.99.

* If you want super ultra-thin, go for the Scarf case from Totallee. It’s one of the least intrusive cases I’ve ever used—so much so that it almost feels more like a skin than a case. It’s made of durable polypropylene plastic and measures 0.02 inches thick. It’s semi-transparent so you can still see that great iPhone design, and it has this great anti-slip texture.
* You can buy the Totallee Scarf case for iPhone 7 for $14.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $14.99.
* Update: since the original post date, I have begun using a Scarf on my personal iPhone 7 Plus, and I have to say I really like it. You can barely tell the case is there, it looks sharp, and really does add a bit of grip. I posted a [terrible] photo here.

* The Caudabe Veil was recommended to us by a reader, and after a bit of research, it looks like a solid option. The ultra thin case features a ridge around the camera cutout to protect the protruding lens, a micro-etched matte surface for a beautiful finish and excellent grip, and of course a super slim 0.35mm profile. Available in multiple colorways.
* You can buy the Caudabe Veil XT case for the iPhone 7 for $19.95 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $20.95.

* This one was also referred to us by a reader. The Shumuri Slim Extra for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus checks off all the boxes you could want in an ultra-slim case: 0.35mm profile, improved grip and a protective lip for the camera. Where the Shumuri differs a little bit is in its Travel Edition, which actually offers a cutout for quick access to the SIM card tray. This allows you to quickly swap SIMs while traveling.
* You can buy the Shumuri Slim Extra case for iPhone 7 for $18.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $19.99.

* We didn’t include the Peel in the first publishing of this roundup because of poor shipping times, but it certainly belongs in the conversation. I haven’t tried it myself, so I don’t know how it compares to the Scarf and other similar cases, but it has the same 0.35mm thinness mark and looks sharp in the product photos. It too offers a branding-free design, grippier texture, and comes in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Peel Super Thin case for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $24.99.

* If that’s still not thin enough, you can skip the case all together and opt for a full body skin—it’s a lot like a screen protector for the front and back of your iPhone. There are a lot of these out there, but we like the TechSkin for its availability, price, user reviews, and its Lifetime Replacement Warranty.
* You can buy the TechSkin Full Body Skin for iPhone 7 for $9.95 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $9.95.
