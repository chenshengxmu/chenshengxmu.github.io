* LockInfo was one of the first jailbreak solutions for getting more out of your iPhone’s bland and boring Lock screen.
* Now the same developer behind LockInfo is borrowing one of that tweak’s best features and developing it into a standalone release.
* The result is called Forecast, and it provides a cheap and simple method for accessing weather on your Lock screen without needing the full version of LockInfo…
* Forecast grabs its information directly from your iPhone’s weather app, hence, there are no settings to configure. Whatever location happens to be at the top of your list is what Forecast will display on your Lock screen.
* Forecast is also compatible with Location based GPS weather if enabled, and features a handy refresh button on the Lock screen to grab the latest weather info and 6-day outlook.
* For those anxious to give Forecast a try, you can download it from Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $0.99.
* What do you think?
