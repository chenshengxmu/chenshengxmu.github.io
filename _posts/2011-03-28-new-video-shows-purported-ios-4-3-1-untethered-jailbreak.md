* It looks like an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.1 might not take as long as people might have thought.
* This new video shows off an iPod touch that’s running iOS 4.3.1 with an untethered jailbreak.
* If you’re still unsure what the benefits of an untethered jailbreak are, check out this article.
* Does this mean that the author will release a jailbreak tool themselves? Well, not exactly, but this is still great news for jailbreakers…
* In the description of the YouTube video showcasing the untethered jailbreak, the author explains his position:
* a. I repeatedly stated that I will not release a jailbreak tool – I will only give out the untether. I did not try yet, but if it is feasible the untether could be a cydia package.
* b. While the vulnerability I use is in the iPad 2 kernel my untether will NOT SUPPORT the iPad 2, because there is no way to install it there (bootrom exploits fixed). – however Comex is working on that part.
* c. I am not giving out any ETA again, because the Jailbreak community is simply nuts. Last time I gave an ETA and even before that had passed I got constantly insulted by people that were demanding an immediate release. Sorry guys the more you insult people with the knowledge to actually do what YOU WANT the less motivation there is to use our free time to give it to you.
* So although we won’t be receiving a jailbreak tool with untethered capabilities from the author — his video uses the latest version of Sn0wbreeze to showcase the untethered possibilities — it is possible that we could see it in Comex’s future jailbreak solution or as a package on Cydia.
* Either way, definite progress is being made, which is a great thing for the community.
* It’s getting closer folks, what do you think?
