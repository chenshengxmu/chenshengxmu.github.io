* Halide Camera, the premium RAW and manual shutter image-taking app by Chroma Noir LLC, was updated on App Store this morning with an all-new Apple Watch remote function, a self-timer feature, a redesigned reviewer and other perks.
* Halide’s 1.8 update adds a watchOS companion app that you can use as a remote trigger to preview and take shots from your wrist, with a live preview. This is similar to Apple’s stock Camera remote on Apple Watch and we’re glad to see Halide has implemented this feature.
* If you want to be in a group photo, this is the feature to use.
* Remote trigger also lets you avoid camera shake during a long exposure. Just open Halide on your phone and then open the Halide app on your Apple Watch.
* Folks who don’t have an Apple Watch can take advantage of Halide’s newly implemented self-timer feature to take a photo or a group photo with a delay. When you’re taking group shots with self-timer, you’ll notice that the LED on the back of your iPhone flashes as it counts down.
* With a completely redesigned photo review, Halide makes it easy to go back in time.

* The photo reviewer now offers a grid-view option like the stock Photos app.
* If you like browsing photos in a grid, you can now do that in Halide. You can swipe horizontally in the photo reviewer to change photos or swipe down to get back to the viewfinder instantly.
* Halide now supports Dynamic Type—choose the font size in your Dynamic Type settings and your Halide camera, the photo reviewer and the settings interface will adapt automatically to reflect your chosen font size. As a bonus, they’ve also improved how things look when the Bold Text feature is enabled in the Settings app.
* This update is free to existing users of the app.
* Halide Camera is $5.99 on App Store.
