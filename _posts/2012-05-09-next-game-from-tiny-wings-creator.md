* We instantly fell in love with Tiny Wings by Andreas Illiger, an addictive game featuring a cute bird flying through a series of random hills. The game still files as one of the best entertainment releases to hit the App Store since Angry Birds.
* Apple loves it, too, and it even inspired a charming knock-off dubbed Whale Trail. Having earned a fortune from Tiny Wings, the developer shared a little secret on his upcoming project, scheduled to hit the App Store by June.
* In a rare interview with Flow Studio, Illiger announced a new iOS game “in less than three weeks”, following more than ten months of development. He wouldn’t reveal any detail beyond saying it’s “a big secret”.
* If Tiny Wings is an indication, we’re in for another round of highly addictive gameplay. He was a little “shocked” with the success of Tiny Wings and said the money didn’t spoil him.
* Suddenly the whole world went to my room and everybody wanted something: to buy me, to buy the license, sell merchandising stuff, make cinema movie. It was totally crazy.
* I am still the guy I was before Tiny Wings and I just want to make cool games, that’s my passion
* In fact, Illiger only purchased a new computer. He did not hire a bunch of people nor did he set aside a big marketing budget to push his future projects.
* Here’s a nice clip featuring Illiger at last month’s A MAZE Awards in Berlin, Germany.
* As for the Tiny Wings concept, Illiger remarked:
* There are many destructive and negative games so I wanted to figure out if it is possible to make a game which makes you feel happy.
* Are you looking forward to his new game?
* If it’s anything along the make-you-feel-happy lines, I’m sold.
