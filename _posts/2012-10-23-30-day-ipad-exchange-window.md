* Good news this afternoon for folks who recently purchased a third generation iPad. Reports are coming in that some Apple Stores are offering a 30-day window to exchange the now-obsolete tablet for the new one.
* Earlier today, Apple announced the fourth generation iPad, an update to its larger 9.7-inch tablet line that includes a better processor and other improvements, a mere six months after it launched its predecessor…The move was somewhat unexpected, at least to the general public, as Apple typically refreshes its mobile devices once a year. This has left some iPad 3 owners, especially new ones, feeling a bit disappointed and misled.
* But it sounds like Apple has a plan in place for these customers. CNET is reporting that some Apple Stores are allowing a 30-day exchange window for people who bought the third-generation iPad within the last month.
* “The manager at the Stockton Street store in San Francisco explained that “this specific store” would allow purchasers of the third-generation iPad to exchange their device for the fourth-generation iPad if purchased within the last 30 days. She emphasized that, unless the recently-purchased iPad showed serious signs of wear-and-tear, the usual 14-day return policy would be waived.
* “And what about other stores?” You’ll have to call and find out. She explained, “We can’t speak to other stores’ policies — this is something our store has decided to do.”
* If the above criteria applies to you, it’s definitely worth giving your local Apple Store a ring. The new iPad features a faster A6 processor, Apple’s new Lightning connector, broader LTE support and an HD FaceTime camera.
* So what’s Apple going to do with all of these returned iPads? We imagine they’ll wind up in the refurbished section of Apple’s online store. Word is that third-generation iPads are now available there for as low as $379.
