* As much as we want to keep our iPhone 6 screen totally unobstructed by anything that takes away from the smooth look and feel, we still want to protect our display from unfortunate accidents, like scratches or cracks.
* Tech Armor has a Ballistic Glass Screen Protector that keeps your iPhone 6 screen from accidents while maintaining the feeling of smooth glass and clarity of the HD screen.
* The screen protector is made from super strong glass with a hardness rating of H9. So, it can take a hit pretty good before it suffers any damage. When it does, it will take the impact of drops so that your screen doesn’t. And, to add a little frosting to the cake, if your screen protector cracks, you will be able to replace it for free thanks to the company’s lifetime warranty.
* The glass is about 3 mm thick. It is super protective, but has been known to affect usage with some cases that tightly fit the iPhone 6. So, do a bit of research before investing. Depending on your case, it might be better to do away with what you have and buy a new one that is compatible with Tech Armor’s Ballistic Glass Screen Protector.
* There is an edge-to-edge version that the company claims uses a special “flex bend” that is guaranteed not to peel. However, the company notes in the non edge-to-edge summary that glass screen protectors that fit to the edge of the iPhone 6 don’t work well. Keep that in mind when considering which glass screen protector to purchase.
* Tech Armor is rated very highly on Amazon with a four-star rating on the ballistic glass screen protector out of nearly 10,000 reviews.
* The standard HD Ballistic Screen Protector costs $10 and the edge-to-edge model, with either a black or white frame, costs $15. There is a version for the iPhone 6 Plus in standard for $11 and edge-to-edge for $15.
