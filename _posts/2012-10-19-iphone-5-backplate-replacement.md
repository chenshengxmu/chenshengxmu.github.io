* When it comes to the iPhone 5, yours truly is one to suffer from a severe case of panic disorder stemming from Scuffgate. I, for one, happen to believe that it’s real. And even though Scuffgate has definitely been blown way out of proportion, I can’t shrug off fear that my iPhone 5 will arrive with nicks and scuffs out-of-the-box or scratch itself if I look at it the wrong way.
* As a rule of thumb, I more often than not attempt to mitigate the scuffing issue by opting for white gadgets because scratches from “normal” wear and tear are less visible (by the way, what’s your color of choice for Apple gear?). Still, the fact remains that the iPhone 5’s anodized aluminum casing is arguably the worst choice from the wear and tear standpoint.
* Chances are you too at some point will no longer be able to stand dings and scratches on your brand spanking new iPhone 5. Luckily, there’s a solution. Remember those backplate parts that had been leaking in the weeks and months preceding the iPhone 5 announcement? That’s right…
* Here’s a replacement for your iPhone 5 back panel from iPhone5mod (via 9to5Mac).
* This replacement rear case is 100% original , the same thing you are seeing and touching in your iPhone 5 right now.
* The standalone iPhone 5 rear case replacement can be yours in exchange for $99. It’s available from the iPhone5mod web site, in both black and white to match your iPhone 5.

* Apple in August served the iPhone5mod team a takedown notice over their iPhone 5 mod kit which gives the iPhone 4/4S that unmistakable iPhone 5 two-tone look.
* It’s possible that Apple will dispatch its legal sharks once again so you’re advised to act promptly while this thingie part is still available.

* iPhone5mod is also behind an interesting iPhone 5 Flash Lightning Dock that – surprisingly – uses original Lightning controller chips from Apple’s supplier to ensure proper functionality.
* Here it is in the below clip.
* Does the aforementioned iPhone 5 backplate looks like something you’d be willing to consider?
