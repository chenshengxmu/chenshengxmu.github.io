* According to a new Chitika survey, a month following its public release iOS 6 is found on approximately 61 percent of devices. When Chitika conducted a similar survey just 24 hours after iOS 6 availability, it found the software on some fifteen percent of devices (25 percent after 48 hours of availability).
* People who want to be on the bleeding edge of technology usually install the latest and greatest version of iOS within the first week or two, with some opting to hold out until early kinks have been worked out. The numbers do suggest that the rate of iOS 6 adoption is stabilizing.
* Apple itself on September 24 said iOS 6 ran on one-quarter of all iOS devices it sold to that date, amounting to a total of a hundred million iPhones, iPads and iPod touches running iOS 6…
* Chitika observed ad impressions from apps that incorporate its technology so the numbers may not accurately mirror the real world, though a sample comprises of hundreds of millions of mobile ad impressions.
* With that off of our chest, it’s worth mentioning that Chitika also saw iOS 6 adoption rate hitting the 50 percent mark after only two weeks of availability. This means the iOS adoption rate is slowing – that is, stabilizing.

* Chitika explains:
* iOS 6 growth has decidedly leveled out over the past week, although it still is growing. Since our previous study on October 2nd, 2012, iOS 6 gained nearly 10% usage share, now constituting 61% of all iOS traffic.
* Here’s a breakdown of the U.S. and Canadian iOS distribution according to iOS versions. It’s interesting that iOS 5.1 is still found installed on one out of every four devices observed in the Chitika network.

* This isn’t surprising considering that iOS 6 runs only on newer devices and that some features are not available on all supported devices. Some people may have held off upgrading altogether whilst others have older devices that aren’t supported at all by iOS 6.
* Analytics firm Apsalar previously found iOS 6 adoption rate to be more than twice as fast as iOS 5 after two days of availability. Data by app developer Pocket, released on September 28, indicates that nearly 60 percent of all iPhone owners at the time had adopted iOS 6.
* According to Google, at post time 23.7 percent of Android devices had Android Ice Cream Sandwich installed and 1.8 percent were on Jelly Bean.

* Come tomorrow, Apple should alongside the iPad mini and refreshed Macs release iOS 6.0.1 to fix various bugs that early adopters reported. These include the pesky WiFi and cellular connection problem and the annoying screen flicker when using the iPhone 5 keyboard.
* Is there anyone out there among our readers on an iOS version prior to iOS 6?
