* Another week, another expansion of AT&T’s fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Having rolled out LTE to customers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Nashua, New Hampshire and Grand Rapids last week, the Dallas, Texas-headquartered US wireless company Tuesday morning announced the addition of five new LTE markets.
* Customers in Green Bay, Springfield, Tucson, Melbourne and Oxford should start seeing AT&T’s LTE on supported devices. These latest additions expand the carrier’s LTE coverage to 125 metropolitan markets. By contrast, rival Verizon Wireless claims 470 LTE-enabled markets…
* If you’re an AT&T subscriber and live in any of the following areas, you should be seeing LTE speeds on your compatible mobile devices (via CNET):
* • Green Bay, Wisconsin • Springfield, Massachusetts • Tucson, Arizona • Melbourne, Florida • Oxford, Mississippi
* In addition to new markets, AT&T also announced that customers in Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York and Salt Lake City should all benefit from better coverage as well.
* When it comes to download speeds, your mileage will vary from place to place, but you should definitely experience a big increase in network performance and data speeds.
* AT&T last month said its 4G service was in over a hundred markets, covering some 130 million people. The carrier will finish commercial LTE deployment in late-2014 versus mid-2013 for Verizon.
* Even though Verizon’s LTE is available in more US cities than AT&T’s, Consumer Reports thinks the latter’s LTE is the best.
* What’s your experience AT&T’s LTE been like so far?
