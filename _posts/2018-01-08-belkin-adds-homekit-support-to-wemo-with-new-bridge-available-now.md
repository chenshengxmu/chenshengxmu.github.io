* After missing an initial Fall 2017 target release date, Belkin is finally releasing their Wemo Bridge to bring HomeKit support to their popular line of Wemo smart home products.
* Any customer that currently owns select Wemo products will be able to use their accessories with HomeKit after installing the bridge.
* Existing customers may have already seen the bridge appear as details have already been added to the Wemo app.
* “We’ve had an overwhelming positive response from customers when we announced last spring that we would make the Wemo Bridge compatible with HomeKit support, said Kara Alexander, Wemo senior product manager. “We have made it a top priority working with Apple to ensure an incredible experience for both Wemo and HomeKit users. Bringing together two of the most influential Smart Home platforms will enable millions of current and future Wemo users to experience the benefits of HomeKit, including the Apple Home app, Siri integration and interoperability with other HomeKit devices.”
* The bridge is easy to install by using its built-in ethernet cable, you simply connect it to your home router and set it up within the app. Then you are all set to use all of the features of HomeKit including scheduling, Siri, scenes, etc.
* The bridge enables HomeKit support for the Insight Smart Plug, Mini Smart Plug, Motion Sensor, Dimmer switch, and the Light Switch.
* It will be available to order starting today for $39.99 from Belkin, Amazon, Best Buy, and Apple.
