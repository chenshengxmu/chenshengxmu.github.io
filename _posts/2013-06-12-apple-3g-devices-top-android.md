* We’ve always contended that while Android has a numerical advantage over Apple’s iOS, the iPhone and iPad see much greater usage.
* More evidence of that belief: more than half of all 3G cellular traffic comes from Apple devices.
* When combined, the iPhone 4, 4S and 5 account for about 53 percent of all 3G cellular traffic. Adding the iPad boosts the number to nearly 60 percent, according to a firm that analyzes cell network traffic. Where is Android? Samsung’s Galaxy S, S2 and S3 combined make up a bit over eighteen percent of 3G traffic…
* According to Actix, which tracked for six months 3G traffic during the busiest hours, BlackBerry handsets accounted for a bit more than three percent of cellular usage. Nokia doesn’t even appear on the radar.
* By the way, Apple introduced a new feature in iOS 7 that will allow iPhone and iPad owners control how much cellular data usage is allocated either to the device as a whole or on a per-app basis.

* Another interesting wrinkle in the 3G data: the growing importance of tablets.
* Although most iPads connect via Wi-Fi and the iPhone placed in the top three positions of cellular usage, the analysis found tablets consume data at a rate three times that of handsets.
* Key takeaways:
* It’s interesting how Actix terms the rise of tablets “the second phase in the mobile data revolution started by the iPhone in 2007.”
* All of which makes me wonder why carriers want Android devices.
* Despite their numerical advantage, despite being dirt cheap, Android smart devices don’t pay off when it comes to the current cellular holy grail: the data plan.
* Would you agree that Actix survey reflects real-life device usage?
