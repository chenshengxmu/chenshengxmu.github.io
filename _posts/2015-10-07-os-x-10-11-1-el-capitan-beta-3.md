* A third beta of what would become El Capitan’s first major software update following the recent release of the operating system is now available to members of the Apple Developer Program and public beta testers signed for the Apple Beta Software Program.
* The new OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan beta 3 carries a build number of 15B30a and is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store and as a standalone download via the Apple Developer Center.
* The official release notes don’t list any changes for the OS X 10.11.1 beta 3 software, but we’ll make sure to update this article as soon as we find out what’s changed since the previous beta.
* OS X 10.11.1 beta 1 was seeded to developers on September 17 whilst a second beta became available twelve days later, on September 29, 2015.
* The first major software update to El Capitan will bring stability, compatibility and security improvements and enable things like support for Unicode 8 and new emojis, including taco, burrito, cheese wedge, popcorn, middle finger and many more.
* Just yesterday, Apple seeded a fourth beta of the forthcoming iOS 9.1 software update to public testers and developers along with a matching new beta of tvOS, the software platform powering the new Apple TV.
