* Apple’s rumored subscription music service based on Beats Music and with stock iOS Music app integration will be formally announced at this year’s summer developers conference rather than in March, as previously reported.
* Although some have hoped Monday’s “Spring Forward” media event might serve as a launchpad for the service, Apple is now reportedly planning on introducing it in beta form at its Worldwide Developers Conference in early June, 9to5Mac said Thursday.
* The service should launch as part of the iOS 8.4 software update.
* Though was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, the service was delayed “by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple,” author Mark Gurman has learned.
* Indeed, Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, has departed Apple in recent weeks. Gurman is also claiming that the new service will replace the existing Beats channel on the Apple TV.
* Speaking of which, a slimmer set-top box “with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store” may launch later this year, provide Apple finally manages to negotiate deals with content owners to sell linear and non-linear programming through iTunes.
* “As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month,” the report states, speculating that “perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.”
* Apple’s new subscription music service will also include a companion Android app, a first for the Cupertino firm. Gurman now cautions that that delays to the in-house Android app “are also possible” as some of Apple’s Android developers have also left the company.
* The service, based on Beats technology, should be integrated with iTunes right inside the stock iOS Music app and offer curated playlists, cloud-based libraries and recommendations based on your musical tastes.
* Previous reports have claimed that Apple is looking to undercut Spotify and Rdio, that cost ten bucks per month, with a more affordable $8 per month price point.
