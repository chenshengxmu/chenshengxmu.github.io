* Apple’s new Jet Black finish for the iPhone 7 looks breathtaking, but here comes the bad news: it could scratch all too easily though not on the #Scuffgate level. According to Apple itself, the highly glossy back of your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus may show “fine micro-abrasions” with use.
* In fact, the company is recommending that would-be shoppers buy a case to help keep their handset in pristine condition.
* According to a notice on the iPhone 7 Tech Specs page (emphasis mine):
* The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone.
* The same advisory appears as fine print at the bottom of the Buy iPhone 7 page.
* To be honest with you, I’m torn on this issue. On one hand, I’m a huge sucker for that glossy black look—I think it looks fantastic—but I’d be very saddened to see it lose some of its sheen to cosmetic damage.
* I certainly don’t anticipate iPhone 5-like scuffs, mind you.
* That said, and given that I’m planning on picking up a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black, I think there’s no point hiding that gorgeous industrial design inside a bulky case. Exquisitely designed devices like the iPhone 7 want to be touched and felt, not hidden in some case, no matter how attractively designed it may be.
* Speaking of design, Apple has said that the new Jet Black color option will be exclusively available in 128GB and 256GB iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. The “regular” Black (matte) finish will be available across all storage options.
* That’s another thing to factor in, especially if you’re considering picking up an entry-level 32GB iPhone 7 in Jet Black—you’ll either need to spend $100 more to get a 128GB model in Jet Black or, if your budget doesn’t allow for that, opt for a regular matte Black model which is available in the 16GB version.
* Are you going to buy a Jet Black iPhone 7 and risk the scuffs?
* Will you protect it with a case?
