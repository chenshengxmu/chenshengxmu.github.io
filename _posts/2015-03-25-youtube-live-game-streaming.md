* Google is going to announce a new YouTube-branded live video streaming service with an emphasis on gaming, according to the British newspaper The Guardian on Wednesday citing a scoop by tech blog The Daily Dot.
* The Internet giant is reportedly prepping to introduce its live-streaming service under the YouTube Live moniker. YouTube Live will apparently relaunch later this year, re-focused on game streaming and e-sports.
* Such turn of events wasn’t entirely unexpected. A year ago, Google wanted to buy Twitch but has failed to seal the deal and got outbid by Amazon, which paid a cool $1 billion for the popular game-streaming service.
* Google wants to ensure that the new service will attract gamers and has reportedly hired 50 engineers with experience in streaming technology to help build the forthcoming platform.
* The search firm will also partner with major e-sports events which will provide premium content on YouTube Live. The report doesn’t say when a rebranded YouTube Live might relaunch.
* “Gaming and eSports in particular are going to be a big driving force for the new-look YouTube Live. There’ll be huge opportunities for established streamers and organizations soon,” a source told Daily Dot.
* With its strong focus on gaming, I suspect the company could make an announcement at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June.
* Even though YouTube is the world’s most popular destination for sharing user-generated video — one billion people watch hundreds of millions of hours of YouTube content every day — it’s failed to take off in terms of becoming the #1 destination for in-game action streaming.
* YouTube’s top ten gaming channels were watched 2.2 billion times in January 2015, but most of the clips are pre-recorded and not live-streamed like on Twitch.
* Twitch, for example, by mid-2013 had an average of 43 million live viewers per month. By February 2014, the service was considered the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States.
* In September 2014, Amazon bought Twitch for $970 million.
