* Apple’s new flagship handsets, the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max, pack momentous hardware upgrades to the microchips and silicon inside, but they also feature improved resistance to water.
* Taking the stage at the September 12th event, Apple’s own Phil Schiller revealed how the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max each feature a robust IP68 water resistance rating, which is good for 2 meters for up to 30 minutes.
* This new water resistance rating is a welcomed departure from the IP67 water resistance rating provided byt the last-gen iPhone X. That said, you needn’t worry if you drop your shiny new iPhone Xs or iPhone Xs Max in a pool or accidentally soak it with your drink while at dinner.
* Although we never recommend intentionally dropping your electronic devices into hazardously wet situations, the additional water resistance is certainly helpful for those accidental mishaps that would otherwise result in expensive repairs on non-resistant devices.
* Are you happy to see this improved water resistance? Let us know in the comments below.
