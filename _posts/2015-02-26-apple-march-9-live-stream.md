* Apple updated its website this morning to announce that it will be providing a live video stream of its upcoming March 9th event. On a new Live page at Apple.com, the company has posted the ‘Spring Forward’ image it’s been sending out to media outlets, inviting users to join it at 10 am PDT that day for a “special event.”
* We are expecting Apple to use the stage time to reveal further details about its Apple Watch, which is slated to start shipping April. Despite a huge unveiling last fall, the company has been relatively mum about upper tier pricing, battery life, and various other aspects of the device, indicating it has a lot more to talk about.
* The website says that the event will be streamed live to Apple.com, but you will also be able to watch it on your iOS devices and Apple TV. Apple notes that you must be running Safari 5.1.10 or later, or Safari on iOS 6.0 or later to watch the live stream, or you must have a 2nd or 3rd generation set-top box with recent software.
