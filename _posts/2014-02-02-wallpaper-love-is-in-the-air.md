* This week Apple took to their online store, promoting the latest in suggested Valentine’s Day presents for friends, loved ones, and significant others. In this particular splash image, an iPad Air hovered above a heart shadow with a very pink wallpaper.
* I did not think much of the wallpaper used to advertise Apple’s latest tablet, until I began receiving tweets asking about the image. Several dedicated iDB readers know that I collect wallpaper images for this very post. Every Sunday, in the Wallpapers of the Week section, the best images that are stumbled across or sent over, receive highlight in the post. Causing such a stir, I assumed we could all lower our masculine preferences for a week and celebrate pink…
* As I mentioned, it was quite a popular image and three individual readers submitted their version of the wallpaper to me throughout the week. So as to not discourage creativity, I found it prudent to post the different versions, which vary only slightly from each other.
* Variation 1: First up, is graphic artist AR7, who is becoming well know around the wallpaper section. Last week, I took a look at AR7’s new, free wallpaper app and highlighted his newest iPhone theme, Style HD. Just below is AR7’s rendition of Apple’s pink wall, which he termed “Apple St. Valentine.” Follow him @AR72014.

* Download Variation 1: iPhone 5/s/c; iPhone 4/s
* Variation 2: Next, Jon Berry also recreated the wallpaper with a very slightly textured design, opting to provide a smooth transition from a tangerine orange to pink to red. Jon, thankfully, created one for iPad as well. Find him on Twitter @jonnyb098 and check out his blog.

* Download Variation 2: iPhone 5/s/c; iPad retina
* Variation 3: Finally, the last batch is from @afrokat980. Opting out of any texture, his wallpapers are simply a smooth gradient from top to bottom. Unlike the others, these are not parallax ready, but with just solid colors, there should be limited to no distortion. Catch him on Twitter @afrokat980.

* Well, there really is something for everyone in this post! Now, to get them on your device, select which variation you love the most and tap your device named below the thumbnail. After loading the full resolution image, tap hold, then save to Camera Roll. From either Photos.app or Settings.app, set your new pink beauty to wallpaper and enjoy. From a desktop, right click save the image into your iTunes sync folder.
* Who loves the new pink wallpaper that Apple created? Did you guys prefer the textured walls or just the plain gradient above? Here’s to being man enough to rock a pink wallpaper.
