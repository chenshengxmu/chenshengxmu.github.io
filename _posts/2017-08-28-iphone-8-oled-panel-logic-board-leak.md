* Images of an OLED panel along with a photograph of an L-shaped logic board destined for iPhone 8 have escaped Apple’s supply chain ahead of the big reveal on September 12.
* Smartphone leaker Benjamin Geskin on Sunday tweeted out an image of what he claims to represent an L-shaped logic board for iPhone 8. The user GeekBar posted to Chinese social network Weibo an image showing both sides of the board, as seen below.

* Additionally, Russian website iPhones.ru posted images which reportedly depict an edge-to-edge OLED display panel for the handset. The spare parts were obtained from an unnamed manufacturer that makes them, but there’s no way to confirm the veracity of the photos.

* Upon closer inspection, the top of the panel seems to house several sensors, including a rumored 3D camera expected to make its debut on iPhone 8. The OLED iPhone is said to use a screen measuring 5.8 inches diagonally, with a 5.1-inch user space and the remainder dedicated to virtual buttons in what KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo calls a “function area” at the bottom.

* The function area could be hidden or shown with an upwards swipe, potentially allowing users to enter a redesigned app switcher with a simple gesture, no need to press or tap on anything.
* This possible new iPhone app switcher was highlighted in Andrew’s video, embedded below.

* The logic board shown top of post has just one layer.
* iPhone 8 is said to use a stacked logic board to save space and make room for a bigger L-shaped battery. The handset is also expected to use sophisticated biometrics with advanced facial recognition via a pair of new 3D sensors for both its cameras.

* At the moment, the price of these displays is US$5000 on the Chinese black market.

* We should find out the truth soon enough—The Wall Street Journal said today that Apple has scheduled a media event for Tuesday, September 12, to announce 2017 iPhones, a third-generation Apple Watch with LTE and a new Apple TV with support for 4K and HDR video.
* The company is reportedly aiming to use a 1,000-seat underground auditorium, called the Steve Jobs Theater, for the upcoming event, but those plans are contingent upon Apple Park’s construction timetable that could affect the timing or location of the event.
