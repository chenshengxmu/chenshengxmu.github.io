* The United States wireless carrier Cricket Wireless today announced that it will start selling Apple’s new iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c on Friday, October 25. Would-be shoppers can pre-register their interest here or visit the MyCricket website for more information. Cricket, a prepaid Leap Wireless brand, offers a cool $50 a month off-contract nationwide talk/text/data plan and back in May 2012 had become the nation’s first wireless operator to offer unlocked iPhones with a pre-paid plan…
* Cricket operates nationwide 4G LTE and 3G CDMA wireless networks.
* A February report asserted weaker-than-expected iPhone sales as Cricket was reportedly on pace to sell through half of its first-year commitment with Apple.
* While some pundits warned the carrier might be on the hook for some $100 million in remaining iPhone purchases, a subsequent earnings release confirmed Cricket had seen improved iPhone sales after working with Apple on new advertising, pricing plans and other promotions.
* Fierce Wireless reported in August that Cricket’s parent Leap Wireless won’t have to purchase unsold iPhones after all because Apple was happy with Cricket’s efforts to increase sales and Leap’s Phone Payment Plan, which offers Cricket customers three payment options when purchasing a smartphone.
* For those wondering, Leap has a three-year, $900 million iPhone deal with Apple.
* Earlier this month, Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile and an additional nine prepaid U.S. telcos started carrying Apple’s new iPhones.
