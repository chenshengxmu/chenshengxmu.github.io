* Today’s selection is an update to a previously posted collection by @danielkorpai, a graphic designer. I have been using his full color geometric wallpapers on my devices since we posted them a while back.
* In order to really make the abstracts pop with color, Korpai went back to the same collection and put the designs on a completely black background. Consequently, these wallpapers look amazing on the iPhone X’s OLED panel, but these are made for all iPhone devices!
* Below is the collection Korpai created for iPhone X specifically. If you want these wallpapers for iPhone 5/c/s, 6/s/7/8, or the Plus models, you can get native designed images on his dribbble page. While you are there, might as well take a full look at the gallery. There is a lot of great work in there!
* The Wallpapers of the Week series is curated from images I find around the net, or from contributions of my Twitter followers! You can connect with me via @jim_gresham to submit your own wallpapers, tips & tricks, or point me in the direction of a great gallery. Also, I pretty regularly tweet out cool wallpapers, as I find or make them. So, follow along for the latest, including previews of the upcoming iDB wallpapers on Sunday.
