title: Real Racing 3 gaining cloud saves, Hunter game mode, new cars and 100+ events
---
* If you’re a fan of free-to-play Real Racing 3 (which, by the way, looks absolutely stunning on the A6 and later devices, like the iPhone 5 and iPad 4), you’re in for a treat as Electronic Arts today announced an upcoming content update which will bring several new cars, a bunch of new challenges and events, a new game mode and cloud saves across all your devices.
* As you can see from the above trailer for the Real Racing 3: Chevrolet Update, developer Firemonkeys is teasing at least two new cars, the Chevrolet Cobalt SS and the Camaro ZL1. I’ve included more tidbits right after the break…
* According to a Facebook post, the upcoming update will also enable an all-new Hunter game mode, over a hundred new events and “many extra features and tweaks.”
* Plus, you’ll be able to compare and compete with friends using the new statistics leaderboard.
* I’m definitely looking forward to the Cloud Save functionality which will sync in-game progress across all devices so you could switch back and forth from your iPhone and iPad.
* Unfortunately, Firemonkeys didn’t specify whether Cloud Save will work across platforms letting me play the game on my iPad and pick up right where I left off on Android, and vice versa.
* Real Racing 3 is a free universal binary download from the App Store.
* You can enhance your experience through in-game purchases, though it’s not like the game concept forces you to buy anything – I’ve been enjoying it without spending a dime on extras.
* Firemonkeys says the update “will be available soon” via the App Store, Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android.
* I’ll admit it: the Camaro will be fun, but what about the Corvette?
