* Snapchat today announced a major update to its free-of-charge mobile application on the App Store. The new version brings out a major new feature, Memories, a new way to save a personal collection of your favorite Snaps and Stories. Also, the app now lets you send Snaps and make new Stories from Memories, find other people’s Moments with search and more. To open Memories, just swipe up from Snapchat’s built-in camera.
* “It’s super easy to find the Snap or Story you’re looking for in just a few seconds by typing keywords like ‘dog’ or ‘Hawaii’—that way you can spend less time searching and more time enjoying your Memories,” said Snapchat.

* Different Stories can be combined into a longer Moments narrative and you can rest assured that Snapchat will safely back up all of your Memories.
* “We won’t back up any photos or videos from your Camera roll, unless you use one to make a new Story or add it to My Eyes Only,” said Snapchat, adding that in that case they’ll back up only the photo or video that you used.
* Here’s Snapchat’s promotional video for Memories.
* The refreshed app includes a few other improvements, too.
* As an example, you can now send Snaps from Memories to friends and family, or post them to your Story more easily than before. “If you post a Snap you took more than a day ago to your Story, it will appear with a frame around it so that everyone knows it’s from the past,” explains the Snapchat team.
* Another new, privacy-enhancing feature lets you move Snaps and Stories to a new My Eyes Only section that only you can see.

* Moments is a staggered release over the next month or so, meaning not everyone will get the feature at the same time. In fact, Snapchat says that individual users shall receive a chat from Team Snapchat when Memories is available for them to use.
* Snapchat for iOS is a free download from the App Store.
