title: The iOS Maps song
---
* The song-a-day man Jonathan Mann can be funny as hell, even more so considering he’s been able to write a song a day for more than two years straight without ever running out of inspiration. He’s back at it again with a new song about Apple’s mapping woes. If you like it, check out his birthday song to Siri from last week (part one from last year is here). Joy of Tech also has a nice take on what happens when Apple Maps meet Siri…
* You probably recognize Mann as the guy who did Antennasong, published on the eve of Apple’s hastily organized press conference to contain Antennagate in the summer of 201.
* He also did a charming tribute to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
* Did you like the Maps song?
