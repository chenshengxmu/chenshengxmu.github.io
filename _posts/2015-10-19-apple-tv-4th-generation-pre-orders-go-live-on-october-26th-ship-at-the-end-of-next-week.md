* Mark your calendars, ladies and gentlemen. Orders will go live for Apple’s highly anticipated Apple TV refresh on Monday.
* At the Wall Street Journal backed WSJDLive conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., Apple CEO Tim Cook was interviewed about a variety of different topics, including Apple Watch, CarPlay, Apple Music, and of course, the Apple TV 4.
* In the interview, Cook spilled the beans about the Apple TV 4th generation order date and shipment time frame…
* According to Cook, who is, you know, in the know about such dates, the Apple TV 4 will go on sale next Monday, October 26th. We’re assuming that this will be at 12:01 AM PST on Monday, which will be like late Sunday night for many of you.
* Later that week, Apple will begin fulfilling orders of those initial shipments. Cook states that the new Apple TV will begin shipping by the end of next week.
* Does this mean that the actual hardware will arrive at homes on Friday, similar to an iPhone launch? That’s still not totally clear. What is clear, however, is that the Apple TV order process will begin in just 6 days, so get ready.
* You can head over to the WSDJLive blog website for more information and details discussed in the sit down session. Are you happy that we now have a concrete order date for the Apple TV 4?
