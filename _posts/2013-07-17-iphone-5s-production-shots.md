* Just a day after AllThingsD confirmed analyst Piter Misek’s claim of the iPhone 5S production ramp-up in July, a Chinese website leaks a few images that appear to depict a bunch of production iPhone 5S units.
* There’s no way of determining authenticity of the photos because the iPhone 5S is widely expected to re-use the two-tone design of the current-generation iPhone 5.
* The Chinese source also spelled out technical specifications that match up with past rumors.
* Go past the fold for the full breakdown…
* Our Chinese is a little rusty, but according to a machine-translated article published by the Chinese-language website EXPReview, the iPhone 5S features a four-inch IGZO panel (Sharp?) with the same 1,136-by-640 Retina resolution at 326 pixels-per-inch.
* You may recall a Korean publication recently said Apple was finally ready to make a switch from traditional LCD IPS technology to energy-efficient IGZO panels.
* Co-developed by Sharp and Semiconductor Energy Laboratories, IGZO (indium gallium zinc oxide) panels consume just a fraction of power needed to drive LCDs while providing deeper blacks and richer colors.

* The report goes on to mention that the iPhone 5S will run an improved processor featuring faster graphics: Imagination Technologies’ quad-core PowerVR SGX 554MP4 GPU instead of the three-core PowerVR SGX543MP3 driving graphics on the iPhone 5.
* The CPU part is said to feature 2GB of RAM, twice as much than the iPhone 5’s 1GB of LPDDR2-1066 RAM. Doubling the RAM would allow for smoother multitasking, faster performance and better responsiveness. Other than that, the device’s CPU is said to be still a Swift dual-core variant.
* Other tidbit mentioned include support for 4G LTE-Advance networking (again, matching up with recent chatter), a twelve-megapixel camera with dual-LED flash (likely rocking improved night shooting and super slow-motion video capture) and both NFC and fingerprint (Authentec-made?) sensors.
* The pretty reliable Japanese blog Macotakara recently claimed the next iPhone will be outfitted with both NFC and fingerprint-scanning technology to enhance the security and capabilities of iOS-driven mobile payments. If that’s the case,, we should then expect an iTunes Wallet announcement as well.
* For what it’s worth, we recently heard from another source that integrating fingerprint tech underneath the Home button was causing production issues that might cause supply constraints at launch.
