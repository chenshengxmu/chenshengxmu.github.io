* Ever feel frustrated that you can’t arrange your iPhone apps icons the way you want on your springboard? Then relax because we’ve got the solution for you. It’s called Gridlock.
* Gridlock is a new jailbreak application by developers Chpwn and P0sixNinja that lets you rearrange your icons any way you want them to be, simply by dragging and dropping them.
* No more need for annoying blank icons! Gridlock is fully compatible with most icon tweaks: Infinidock, Infinifolders, Iconoclasm, and FiveIRows (in addition to many more not listed here).
* Gridlock is available from Cydia for $0.99. Have you installed it yet? What do you think?
