* With the WWDC keynote wrapped up, Apple has now posted latest product introduction videos to its official YouTube channel, including one aptly titled “Apocalypse” that highlights the importance of mobile apps (it was played as an opening intro for WWDC attendees).
* Some of the hardware products and updates announced today are available immediately, like the refreshed Mac desktops and notebooks, while others will arrive later in the year, like the firm’s Siri-powered smart speaker, called HomePod, and the new iMac Pro.
* “Ever wonder what life would be like if all our apps suddenly disappeared? Enter the Apocalypse,” reads the videos description.
* Song: “All Right” by Christopher Cross
* “Immersive hi-fi audio. All the music you love. And the intelligence of Siri. Welcome HomePod.”
* As we told you, HomePod will be available beginning this December. To learn more about Apple’s Siri-enabled smart speaker with HomeKit support and more, visit apple.com/homepod.
* “With the world’s most advanced display, the powerful A10X Fusion chip, and a new 10.5-inch model, the new iPad Pro is everything you want modern computing to be.”
* Productivity-enhancing OS 11 features shown in the video will be available this fall.
