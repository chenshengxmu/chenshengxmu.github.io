* The first reviews are coming in and now we’re seeing unboxing videos for the Apple Watch Series 4 drop. Interestingly, it looks like Cupertino is changing how it boxes this year’s wearable device as at least one of those videos shows.
* In iJustine’s recently published unboxing and review, you can clearly see that Apple has changed the watch’s package style. The Apple Watch Series 4 packaging contains two separate items. In one box, you’ll find the watch and charger; in another, a box containing unattached bands. This is the first time an Apple Watch has shipped without bands being attached.
* There’s also all-new packaging wrap inside. As 9to5Mac rightly pointed out, the print looks inspired by Apple’s pricey design book that launched two years ago.
* It’s also worth pointing out that iJustine’s gold stainless steel Apple Watch Series 4 is also wrapped in a cloth pouch. It’s unclear whether the less expensive aluminum models will also ship with one.
* There’s one final piece of Apple Watch news. 9to5Mac readers recently pointed out that the Apple Watch Series 3 GPS only model no longer ships with a 5W USB charging brick, although the cable remains. Apple made a similar move once the Apple Watch Series 1 became the company’s budget wearable device a few years ago. The Apple Watch Series 3 model with LTE keeps the brick, however.
* Do you need some more eye candy before receiving your Apple Watch Series 4 this Friday? Here are two more unboxing videos:
