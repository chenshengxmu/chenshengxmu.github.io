* Apple has released two new software updates for OS X Mavericks beta testers. Included is an update for AirPort Utility, bringing the release to 6.3.1, and a 1.0 update for the Mavericks Developer Preview Recovery Update. Both releases can be obtained by beta testers by opening the App Store app and clicking the Updates tab in the upper right-hand corner. Check inside for a few more details as to what the updates consist of.
* The AirPort Utility 6.3.1 update is for 802.11n and 802.11ac AirPort base stations, including the AirPort Express, Extreme, and Time Capsule. The update was pushed to resolve an issue where AirPort base stations failed to appear in the AirPort Utility app. If you’ve been having trouble getting AirPort Utility to recognize your Apple base station while running Mavericks, then you should definitely consider updating to version 6.3.1.
* The second release is for the Mavericks Developer Preview Recovery Update, and it includes improvements to OS X Recovery. As to what those improvements are, Apple doesn’t specify on the update details found on the App Store. If we find out any additional details as to what the update consists of, we will let you know.
