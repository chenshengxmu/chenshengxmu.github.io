* Trading of Apple shares has been briefly halted this morning. According to Business Insider, an errant trade caused the stock to crash a whopping nine percent, hitting a low of $542.80. Trading’s been resumed and AAPL opened at $598.39. The Apple stock trades on Nasdaq under the AAPL symbol…
* According to Peter Kafka over at the Wall Street Journal’s MarketWatch blog, AAPL was halted for five minutes from 10:57am Eastern to 10:52am. It looks like “a fat-finger trade” is to be blamed for the incident, he wrote. A fat-finger trade, Fortune’s Philip Elmer-DeWitt educates us, is caused by someone hitting the wrong key.
* CNBC explained on Twitter that “Apple had 1 trade at 10:57:36 that printed at $542.80. It was 100 shares and it traded on the BATS exchange”. Nasdaq canceled the erroneous Apple trades made on the BATS exchange as well. A spokesperson for BATS attributed the crash in their system to an issue with the matching engine.
* Bloomberg corroborates:
* BATS sent a notice about 10 minutes before the Apple trade saying it was investigating “system issues” affecting companies with ticker symbols ranging between A and BF. Apple’s is AAPL.
* BATS is an electronic trading network that lets investors trade stocks outside of the major stock exchanges. Ironically, the BATS incident couldn’t have come at a worse time as they just went public today. According to Asymco analyst Horace Dediu, a cool $15.44 billion is being spent buying Apple shares every day.

* Apple is up more than 50 percent for the year. The company now accounts for 12 percent of the NASDAQ Composite index, which itself is up “only” 18 percent year-to-date. Thanks to its market cap just shy of $560 billion, Apple is now the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company.
* Last week, Apple zoomed past the $600 a share mark, meaning a single share of Apple, Inc. was worth more at the time than a 32GB WiFi iPad 3. It was another lifetime high for the Cupertino, California-headquartered designer of gadgets (it seems to be doing that a lot lately).
* Unfortunately, yours truly does not own shares of Apple nor of any other company.
