* More evidence has surfaced that Apple is planning to rebrand OS X to macOS in the near future. As noted by MacRumors, a reference to the name-change has been spotted on a developer FAQ page outlining the new App Store revenue sharing policies.
* The news follows a March sighting of a macOS reference hidden inside OS X code, and a similar slip-up in April on Apple’s website. The change has long been speculated about, as it would bring the desktop OS in line with its younger platform siblings.
* Here’s the latest reference, as seen on the iTunes Connect Resources and Help page, under the section titled ‘When will I earn 85% of my auto-renewable subscription’s price?’
* After a subscriber completes one year of paid service of your auto-renewable subscription, you automatically receive 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes, on the subscriber’s subsequent renewals. Service level changes within a subscription group do not interrupt days of paid service. 
* The ability to earn 85% takes effect in June 2016 for subscription renewals occurring after that date. iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS apps are eligible.
* While this seemingly confirms the impending rebranding, we won’t know for sure until it happens. Luckily, we don’t have long to wait to find out. Apple is expected to talk about the future of all of its software platforms at the WWDC keynote on Monday.
