* FixYa, an online tech support community, released a new report over the weekend regarding the top 5 most commonly reported issues in some of today’s most popular smartphones.
* The data comes from more than 25 million users, and 650,000 experts. And the report covers top handsets like the iPhone 4S, the Nokia Lumia 900, and the Samsung Galaxy S III…
* As far as the iPhone 4S goes, the top 5 most reported issues are:
* There really aren’t any big surprises here. The iPhone 4S has indeed taken a lot of heat over its poor battery life. And although it stills lasts longer than most of its competitors, it’s considerably worse than the iPhone 4.
* The Wi-Fi connection problem has also been widely documented. We’ve seen it affect the iPhone 4S, the new iPad, and other iOS devices. But the Bluetooth Connection thing is a new one to us.
* Perhaps most interesting is the fact that only 10% of complaints from iPhone 4S users are about Siri. Apple is actually being sued by multiple 4S owners right now, who claim that the digital assistant isn’t as good as it is in the commercials.
* Here are the top 5 complaints for the Galaxy S III and Nokia’s Lumia 900:
* Galaxy S III
* Nokia Lumia 900
* The entire report is really worth reading, especially if you or someone you know is in the market for a new smartphone. Sometimes you can tell more about a handset by looking at its flaws, rather than its features.
* Do you agree with these top 5 complaints? What are yours?
