* The stock volume HUD is one of the most recognized pain points among iOS users of all types. Fortunately, jailbreaking offers a way to customize how it looks so that you don’t have an enormous eyesore popping up in the center of your screen all the time.
* Aerify by iOS developer LonestarX is one of the latest jailbreak tweaks to tackle the volume HUD problem in iOS, and it does so in a pleasant way; best of all, it won’t cost you any money.
* In the screenshot examples above, you can observe how Aerify spearheads the problem by moving the volume HUD into the Status Bar. The new slider appears when you press either of your volume buttons and then automatically disappears after just a few seconds.
* Right out of the box, both the slider and the bar are colored white, but you can customize the color scheme and so much more from the new preference pane that makes its way into the Settings app after installation:

* Here, you’ll find a handful of options such as:
* You’ll notice that there isn’t a way to respring your device from the preference pane, and that’s because respringing isn’t necessary to save your changes. Instead, they take effect immediately. How’s that for convenience?
* Given how much I dislike the stock volume HUD, I consider Aerify to be a significant improvement. Furthermore, I dig all the customization options that the developer includes in the tweak despite the free price tag.
* If you’d like to give Aerify a try for yourself, then you can download it for free today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Aerify works on all jailbroken iOS 9, 10, and 11 devices, including the iPhone X.
