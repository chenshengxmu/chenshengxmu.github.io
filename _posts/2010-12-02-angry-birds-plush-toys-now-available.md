* Needless to say that we at iDB are big fans of Angry Birds, these cute and addictive birds that are putting their lives on the line to fight the evil green pigs. We had been waiting for those Angry Birds plush toys for a while, and they are now available for sale, at least while supplies last.
* Looking at the website where you can buy them, I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed by their looks though. Maybe even more disappointing is the fact that they won’t ship until January 2011. So much for surprising my fiancee with one of those for Christmas…
* Selling at $15 a piece, I don’t think they’re a bad deal and I’m sure they will sell fast, so if you want one of those, you should get on it quickly.
* What do you think? Will you be buying some Angry Birds plush toys this holiday season?
