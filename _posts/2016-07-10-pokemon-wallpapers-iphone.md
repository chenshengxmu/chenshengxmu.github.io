* Late last week, Nintendo’s newest iOS experience launched as Pokémon GO hit the App Store. The augmented reality game requires players to actually roam around in real space, think outside, homes, offices, restaurants, looking to “actually” capture Pokémon in the wild. Some otherwise dormant gamers have even taken to Twitter, complaining about the added exercise of walking around.
* The resurgence of Pokémon on iOS caused a flurry of excitement with those newly interested gamers or some playing for the nostalgia. Regardless, Pokémon GO is extremely popular on the App Store. Don’t miss your chance to catch all of this week’s Pokémon inspired iPhone wallpapers.
* The Wallpapers of the Week section is a collection of photo quality images for iOS devices and sometimes desktop. Posts are curated from images found around the Internet, submitted to me directly, or bumped into via Twitter.
* If you would like to submit an image (it doesn’t have to be an original), just catch me via Twitter @jim_gresham or follow along for new wallpapers during the week.
