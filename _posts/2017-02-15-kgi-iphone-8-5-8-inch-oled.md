* This year’s flagship iPhone, often referred to as the ‘iPhone 8’ or ‘iPhone X,’ will feature a 5.8-inch display reports KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo. In his latest research note, shared by MacRumors, the analyst says 5.15-inches of the display will be usable, with the rest of it reserved at the bottom for “virtual buttons.”
* As has been previously rumored, Kuo says the display will take up the entire front of the phone, meaning no bezels or physical Home button. This also means that although the handset will have a display roughly the size of the current iPhone 7 Plus, its body may not be much bigger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7.
* In addition to the OLED iPhone 8, the research note reaffirms speculation that Apple will also launch new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD handsets this year. It’s possible they may see minor performance improvements, similar to the Series 1 Apple Watch strategy, but the consensus is the OLED iPhone will be the flagship.
* Other new features rumored for Apple’s new handset include wireless charging, a glass body framed by stainless steel, better battery life and some sort of augmented reality feature. It’s believed, and Kuo reiterates this in today’s note, that these enhancements will push the iPhone’s full retail price tag beyond $1,000.
