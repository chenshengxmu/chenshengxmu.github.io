* Last week we showed you a concept video by Jan-Michael Cart of how speech recognition might work on iOS 5. Although it is just a concept developed by a person not related to Apple, it’s still interesting to see how things might work one day on the iPhone. Jan-Michael is back at it this week with a concept video of how multitasking and app switching might work on iOS 5.
* Even though Apple made a huge step forward with iOS 4 and the introduction of multitasking, there is still some room for improvement, and this video is the proof of it…
* Personally, I would definitely be excited to see this on my iPhone. What about you?
