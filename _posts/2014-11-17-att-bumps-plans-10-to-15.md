* AT&T announced a new promotion today regarding its Mobile Share Value plans. The limited-time offer gives qualified customers 15GB of monthly shareable data, for the price of 10GB, which typically runs $100 per month plus device access charges.
* The change puts AT&T’s 15GB plan on-par price-wise with Verizon’s 15GB More Everything share plan, which also runs $100 per month plus access charges. These access charges for both plans run $40 per device, unless you subscribe to Next or Edge.
* AT&T points out that with 15GB of monthly data, customers are able to stream 160 hours of music, 30 hours of video, or 300 hours of web usage. You could also post 1000 messages with photos to social media, and send and receive over 10,000 emails.
* The 15GB promotional upgrade is available now to both new and existing AT&T customers, who can take advantage it by visiting att.com or via the myAT&T app. The carrier doesn’t say how long the promo will last, but it should stick through December.
