* Most of the reports we’ve seen thus far regarding the iPhone 6 point to a larger display and much thinner profile. And earlier today, our friends over at Nowhereelse.fr posted new evidence to support that theory: a case maker’s model for the handset from Chinese case manufacturer Elam.
* As you can see in the photo above, the design of the phone looks very similar to what we’ve seen so far. Note the device’s extremely thin profile, rounded corners and larger display. It looks very much like the device we’ve been seeing lately in purported schematics and designer mockups…
* Here’s a schematic drawing of the two rumored iPhone 6 models, published by Japanese magazine MacFan last week:

* And here’s a mockup of the two handsets by Ferry Passchier, based on the above schematics, commissioned by MacRumors:

* There are a few discrepancies within the images though. For example, in the schematics it shows two separate pill-shaped volume buttons, but the case-maker model atop shows a unified volume rocker switch. And we also don’t see the sleep/wake button, which has been rumored to be relocated to the side.
* As for the hardware, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported last night that both iPhone 6 models will feature an A8 processor, 1GB of RAM, upgraded cameras, an NFC chip and Touch ID. He also believes the 4.7-inch version will have a 1334×740 display (326 ppi) and the 5.5-inch a 1920×1080 display (401 ppi).
* Apple’s next-gen iPhone is expected to go into production as early as May, ahead of a September launch. But we have seen multiple reports now calling for the 5.5-inch version to be delayed a few months due to production issues.
