* If you have a jailbroken device with a Touch ID Home button, then you’re probably all too familiar with the fact that you can’t immediately use Touch ID to unlock your device right after you respring it.
* Touch ID Respring Fix is a new free jailbreak tweak that fixes this problem, and it’s available in Cydia right now.
* The problem isn’t that you can’t use Touch ID at all after a respring, rather, it’s a momentary problem. If you have a Touch ID device and respring it, such as after installing a jailbreak tweak, you’ll find that putting your finger on the Home button won’t unlock your device as you’d expect it to; the display will just fall asleep instead.
* But then again, if you press the Home button or you sleep and wake your device immediately after a respring, then try to use Touch ID, it works. Weird… right? It turns out you’re not the only one having this behavior. It’s a small bug.
* After you install Touch ID Respring Fix, you will be able to use Touch ID to unlock your iPhone or iPad immediately after a respring. It’s as simple as that.
* There aren’t any options to configure, and the tweak starts to work as soon as you install it. It’s compatible with iOS 7 through iOS 9 on all Touch ID-capable devices.
* If you want to download Touch ID Respring Fix on your jailbroken device, you’ll find it in Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
