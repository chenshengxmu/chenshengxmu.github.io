title: Users complain of issues with stock Weather app after jailbreaking
---
* Evasi0n, the long-awaited untethered iOS 6 jailbreak was released to the public this morning. And aside from some overloaded web servers and Cydia repos, it’s been a fairly smooth ride for most folks.

* But there does seem to be one bug in the utility that is causing problems for [at least some] iPhone users. We’re seeing a lot of folks complain that their stock Weather app crashes after jailbreaking…
* Shortly after evasi0n was released this morning, we started getting reports from readers that the Weather app no longer worked on their iPhones. So I checked mine out, and sure enough, it wouldn’t even open.
* And a quick search for the term ‘jailbreak weather’ on Twitter confirms that this is more than an isolated incident. It would appear that quite a few people are experiencing Weather app issues after jailbreaking.
* We’ve reported the problem to the evad3rs, and they say they’re looking into it. We assume that if this really is a bug, we’ll see some sort of an update or Cydia patch—after these guys get some much-needed rest.
* But for now, the only recommendation for a fix we can make is to try restoring and re-jailbreaking. And if that doesn’t work, look at the bright side: it’ll be sunny out and a cool 73 degrees for the next few days.
* Have you been experiencing problems with your Weather app since jailbreaking?
* Update: pod2g gives us a quick update:
* We are currently investigating the weather app problem. A fix will popup on cydia when the problem is understood.
