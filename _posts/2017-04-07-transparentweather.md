* The background in your iPhone’s Weather app typically illustrates what the weather conditions are like outside, but if you’re looking for something a little different, check out a new free jailbreak tweak called TransparentWeather by CydiaGeek.
* This tweak does away with the animated weather background and makes the app transparent so you can see a ghosted image of your Home screen wallpaper behind all of your weather information.
* I know a lot of people like the look of the animated weather background in the Weather app, but if you’re using a tweak like WeatherLock, then seeing the same animations on the Lock screen than you see when checking your detailed weather information might feel a little redundant and this tweak offers some diversity
* For everyone else who isn’t using WeatherLock, you really don’t have to worry about said redundancy and this tweak is more of an aesthetic option you can choose to apply if you’re a fan of the new look.
* It is worth noting that because TransparentWeather reveals your Home screen wallpaper behind the information in the Weather app, all the parallax motions that you would normally see on the Home screen are also present there, unless of course you have the Reduce Motion option enabled.
* TransparentWeather doesn’t have any options to configure. Once you install it, it takes effect immediately on your device.
* If you’re interested in trying TransparentWeather to see if the effects play nicely with your Home screen wallpaper setup, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now. The tweak is compatible with jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
