* Less than three weeks after releasing the first beta of iOS 9.2.1, Apple on Monday seeded iOS 9.2.1 beta 2 to its registered developers. The software is also available to public beta testers who are signed on Apple’s Beta Software Program,
* The new pre-release software has a build number of 13D14 and can be applied over-the-air on iPhones, iPads and iPods running a prior beta via Software Update.
* A standalone firmware download is available to members of the Apple Developer Program through the company’s official portal for developers.
* The new beta comes nearly a month after the public release of iOS 9.2 back on December 8. As indicated by its minor version number increase, this is likely a small bug fix release. We’ll update the post with any new changes as we encounter them.
