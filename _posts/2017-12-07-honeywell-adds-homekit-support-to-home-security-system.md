* HomeKit support continues to grow in the industry as Honeywell adds support for Apple’s framework for the connected home to its Lyric Controller home security system.
* The new integration comes as a free software update, available to both current and future Lyric Controller customers. Now users are able to use Apple’s Home app or Siri to control different presets, scenes and automations.
* This isn’t Honeywell’s first HomeKit-enabled product, with the Lyric thermostat seeming to be a popular choice for smart home consumers.

* Honeywell’s Lyric Controller can be found on Amazon for $288.
