* In-flight Wi-Fi provider GoGo yesterday released an interesting infographic based on its real-world data on what devices passengers are using to access its service and what they are doing online. Apple’s iPhones and iPads dominated 2012 with a commanding 84 percent share, which sounds about right even if the figure is a bit higher than Apple’s other web usage stats.
* Android is gaining some ground in the air, so to speak, and in 2012 accounted for sixteen percent of in-flight Internet use, sharply up over just 3.2 percent in 2011. Apple’s share in 2011 was 96.8 percent so clearly the company lost some ground to Android.
* Five Apples for every Android on Gogo’s networks is in stark contrast to other surveys highlighting Android’s unit sales lead. Nonetheless, this is a real-world data point, therefore suggesting that either other market share estimates are inherently flawed or that Android-totting passengers are just not as fond of using their devices on a plane as their Apple peers are…
* Or, as Daring Fireball’s John Gruber puts it, it’s more evidence that “iPhone and Android users are not the same.”
* Apple’s iPad is the most popular device to access GoGo’s in-flight Wi-Fi networks. Laptops are second, followed by iPhones. GoGo writes in a blog posting that “Apple devices are still reigning above the clouds, following the tablet trend with the iPad being the device of choice.”
* Tablets in general are the most preferred device to connect to GoGo’s networks (35 percent), followed closely by laptops (33 percent) and smartphones (32 percent).

* As for smartphones only, nearly three out of each four smartphones connecting to GoGo’s in-flight networks in 2012 were iPhones (73 percent) while all Android devices made up an additional 26 percent.
* Blackberrys and Windows based devices are a rounding error, accounting for less than one percent each.
* And what are passengers doing online while above the clouds?

* Surfing the web leads a list of in-air activities, followed by accessing work and personal email, social networking services, news and weather reports (go figure), maps, checking sports scores and shopping.
* Unsurprisingly, Safari is the most popular browser in the air, followed by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox.
* Internet Explorer’s #2 ranking is explainable given the laptop’s 33 percent share of most-surfed devices and work related actives ranking second in the above chart as most corporate services require Microsoft’s browser.
* GoGo’s service covers much of the in-air Internet use in North America: it’s found on more than 1,800 aircrafts across ten major airlines.
* What’s your preferred device to stay connected in the air?
* And what do you use it for once you connect at 30,000 feet?
