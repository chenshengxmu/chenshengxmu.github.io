* If you’re signed on the Apple Beta Software Program, you can now install the latest beta of macOS Sierra on your Mac even if you’re not a developer as macOS Sierra Public Beta 3 just went live minutes after the Cupertino firm posted the third public beta of iOS 10.
* macOS Sierra Public Beta 3 contains the same features as the developer-only macOS Sierra beta 4. Developer-only fourth betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10 were pushed yesterday.
* If you run a prior Sierra beta, are enrolled in Apple Beta Software Program and have a proper configuration file installed on your computer, the latest public beta of Sierra should appear under the Mac App Store’s Updates tab.
* The third public beta of macOS Sierra—and developer-only beta 4—are light on new features as Apple continues squashing bugs and smoothing out the rough edges.
* Release notes for macOS Sierra Public Beta 3 are available from Apple.
