* Games maker Sega last week switched its iPhone and iPad kart racing game, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, from paid to freemium and now the company has put a pair of other Sonic titles on sale.
* Both Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 are now available on sale for 99 cents each, but for a limited time only. These games were previously available for $2.99 each so the combined downloads could save you four bucks right off the bat.
* If you ask me, this is a not-to-be-missed opportunity to pick up these remastered for mobile classic titles at really low prices…
* Here, check out the trailer.
* Billed as the Sonic game which started it all, Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 feature new characters and levels not found in their original releases, have graphics optimized for widescreen Retina screens and a re-mastered soundtrack, include support for Game Center leaderboards and achievements and more.

* Download Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for 99 cents each in the App Store, valid for a limited time. Both titles require iOS 5.0 or later and run fine on older non-Retina devices such as the iPhone 3GS and third-generation iPod touch.
* If you’re a fan of Sega games, check out their first iOS-exclusive game, Sonic Jump or browse all Sega titles in the App Store to find something that suits your tastes.
