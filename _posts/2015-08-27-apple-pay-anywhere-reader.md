* Apple on Thursday announced that it has teamed up with payment service PayAnywhere on a new mobile NFC card reader. It will attach to iOS devices, and support both traditional credit cards and those stored within Apple Pay.
* The reader, which will be available exclusively in Apple Stores in September, will open the door for smaller businesses to begin supporting Apple Pay. PayAnywhere is easy to setup and there are no monthly fees to worry about.
* In a statement, PayAnywhere CEO Marc Gardner said, “to demonstrate how simple and easy it is to accept Apple Pay, we have chosen to cover the first $5,000 in Apple Pay transaction processing with a new PayAnywhere account.”
* “I think we have the best customer experience out there,” Jennifer Bailey, head of Apple Pay, told CNBC. “And I think we have the most secure solution in terms of protecting people’s privacy and their credit card information.”
* PayAnywhere is currently being used by more than 300,000 businesses. During Apple’s most recent earnings call, Tim Cook said Apple Pay is on track to be accepted at more than 1.5 million U.S. locations by the end of the year.
