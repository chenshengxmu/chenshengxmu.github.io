* JailbreakMe, the wildly popular web-based jailbreak tool created by comex, is no more. Comex recently announced that he had been hired by Apple, and the JailbreakMe.com domain has been owned by a third party for quite some time.
* MuscleNerd, frontman for the Dev Team, has warned jailbreakers to stay clear of JailbreakMe.com from now on…
* The owner of the JailbreakMe.com, ConceitedApps, has sold the domain in an attempt to make some quick cash. If you visit the site right now, you’ll notice that a tribute for Steve Jobs is displayed. Comex and MuscleNerd have both cautioned that JailbreakMe could potentially be used for malicious purposes.
* Instead, Jailbreaks.me will become the new home for jailbreakers online.

* JailbreakMe 3.0 was the first tool capable of jailbreaking the iPad 2 on iOS 4.3.3. Comex’s jailbreak will soon be obsolete when iOS 5 is released to the public. The Chronic Dev Team is working on an untethered jailbreak for the iPhone 4S and all other iDevices on iOS 5. We’ll keep you updated on their findings as more develops.
* It’s currently unclear if comex’s untethered jailbreak will be ported to Jailbreaks.me.
* RIP JailbreakMe.
