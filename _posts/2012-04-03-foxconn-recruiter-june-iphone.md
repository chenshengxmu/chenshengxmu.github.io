* Macotakara points to a report this morning from TV Tokyo’s World Business Satellite. The TV show recently conducted an interview with a Foxconn personnel recruiter who had some interesting things to say about the next iPhone.
* According to the blog, the recruiter told the news program that Foxconn is in the midst of a major hiring binge to prepare itself for production of Apple’s upcoming handset — a device, that he says, will be launching in June…
* Here’s an excerpt from WBS’ report courtesy of Google Translate:
* “Foxconn is known in the assembly of Apple products, and has been in the recruitment of 18,000 more personnel. Personnel recruitment office says it’s recruiting for the production of iPhone 5.”
* This actually lines up with a report we heard late last month that Foxconn was looking to hire in upwards of 20,000 new employees in the near future. But we’re still fairly skeptical that we’ll see Apple unveil its next smartphone this summer.
* Up to this point, the rumor mill hasn’t pinpointed a launch date for the sixth-generation iPhone. But fall seems to be the more likely candidate. This would allow Apple to be certain that early iPhone 4S adopters have had the handset for a full 12 months (most carriers will allow subscribers to upgrade their phones after a year), and would set it up for another blowout holiday quarter.
* When do you think Apple will unveil its next iPhone? Summer or fall?
