* In addition to releasing Tomb Raider: Anniversary in the Mac App Store this morning, Mac gaming specialist Feral Interactive also unleashed another premium title in the store, Alien: Isolation – The Collection, a survival horror game set fifteen years after Alien.
* This gigantic 20.89-gigabyte download packs in all previously released downloadable content, including two stand-alone missions set aboard the Nostromo and five mission packs adding new maps, playable characters and challenges to the Survivor and Salvage modes.
* “Marooned on a decaying space station, the Sevastopol, you’ll enter a desperate struggle for survival as you are stalked by a terrifying, deadly Alien,” reads the blurb.
* As you’d expect from the official Alien game, The Collection requires steady nerves as you wonder through the dark corridors and rely on your rusty old motion tracker to warn you of dangers lurking around the corners.

* In Isolation, you’re Amanda, Ellen Ripley’s daughter.
* Your job is to stay alert and out of sight because those ferociously intelligent aliens are all around you and after you. Your goal, needless to say, is to ultimately find out what happened to your mother, which won’t be an easy task to begin with.
* Check out the gameplay video below, it really showcases incredible production value and high graphics fidelity of this triple-A tittle.
* And here’s your official launch trailer.
* “Haunted by a few panicked survivors, the Sevastopol is a labyrinthine environment that conceals clues to its own downfall,” reads the description. “You’ll crawl through air vents, hack computer systems and deploy the available tech to evade the Alien, whose dynamic behavior evolves after each encounter.”
