* Grabbers, like the one in the photo above, appear while trying to invoke Notification Center or Control Center in a full screen app. The grabbers essentially force you to perform two invoking gestures in order to launch Control Center or Notification Center. The grabber feature is there to prevent accidentally launching the aforementioned overlays while using a full screen application or game.
* Some people, apparently, find the grabber feature annoying, and they want to launch Notification Center or Control Center like they normally do, even while using a full screen app. If you’re one of those people, then NoGrabber is something you should consider using. It forces the overlays to behave like normal, eliminating the grabber while in full screen applications. Take a gander at our video walkthrough to see how it works in action.
* NoGrabber, once installed, features a simple preference panel in the stock Settings app. This preference panel allows you to add apps to a whitelist to prevent NoGrabber from working with the apps your select. This is handy for those of you who end up invoking Notification Center or Control Center while in a full screen app, and you find that it significantly degrades the experience.

* If you’re looking for a quick way to use Notification Center like normal in all apps, then NoGrabber is the jailbreak tweak for you. It’s developed by Cunstruck, and can be found on Cydia’s BigBoss repo free of cost.
* Do you think it’s a good idea to remove the overlay grabber from full screen apps? Let me know what your thoughts are in the comment section below.
