* ChargePoint operates the world’s largest electric vehicle charging network. As of today, ChargePoint’s electric vehicle stations in the U.S. can be found through Apple Maps, as reported by 9to5Mac. And because ChargePoint accepts Apple Pay, users can even initiate charging via Apple Maps and complete their payment with a touch of a finger.
* ChargePoint locations appear on the map as badges that can be tapped to reveal information like business hours, pricing, whether or not they accept Apple Pay at that particular location and more.
* ChargePoint has officially confirmed Apple Maps integration, saying:
* Right from their iPhone they can start charging, pay, and see other station details. Once they’re done charging they can navigate to their next destination. The presence of charging station badges on maps reinforces that EVs are going mainstream, with chargers popping up everywhere to make driving electric easy.
* Electric vehicle stations should also be listed when searching along your route.
* ChargePoint’s dedicated mobile app lets you find electric vehicle stations, start a charging session, check your status and view your charging history.
* In July, car-charging spots began cropping up in the stock mapping app via Apple’s deal with Parkopedia which brought car parking/charging data from 6,000 cities to Maps.
