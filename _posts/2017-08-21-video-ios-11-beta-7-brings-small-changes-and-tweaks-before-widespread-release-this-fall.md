* Apple today seeded a seventh beta of iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad to developers and public beta testers along with new betas of macOS High Sierra 10.13, watchOS 4 and tvOS 11.
* Arriving just a week after the release of beta 6, iOS 11 beta 7 (build number 15A5362a) packs in several smaller changes and under-the-hood tweaks as the Cupertino company continues to squash bugs and smooth out the rough edges ahead of the software’s public launch this fall.
* And now, watch Andrew’s hands-on video covering the iOS 11 beta 7 changes.

* This iOS 11 release brings out the following changes:
* According to the official release notes, iOS 11 beta 7 should now properly indicate both when Bluetooth is powered off in Settings and when the user has limited Bluetooth in the Control Center for use only by Apple Watch and Apple Pencil.
* NOTE: Updating from an earlier iOS beta to beta 7 may stall indefinitely.
* If the upgrade process does get stuck for you, don’t panic just yet.
* According to Apple’s release notes on the Dev Center portal accompanying the iOS 11 beta 7 download, should the progress bar in Settings → General → Software Update stay full for more than a few seconds, follow these steps to delete the update and reinstall the new beta:
* 1) Open Settings → General → iPhone Storage.
* 2) Select the iOS 11 Developer Seed causing the error and tap Delete.
* 3) Open Settings → General → Software Update to download the latest iOS 11 beta update.
* NOTE: It’s important you stay on the Software Update pane until the update is ready to install.
* 4) When prompted, install the update.
* And that’s it, the latest beta should now install without any hiccups.
* For all the changes in the previous beta, which include stuff like App Store and Maps icon tweaks, a brand new animation when getting back to the Home screen, an animated AirPods card and more, check out Andrew’s hands-on video walkthrough from last week.
* iOS 11 will release for public consumption this fall across supported iOS device models.
* Originally released as a developer-only preview at WWDC in June, iOS 11 packs in a surprising number of new features, improvements, enhancements and user interface refinements.
