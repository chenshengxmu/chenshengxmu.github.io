* Online retailer Amazon confirmed that its newly released video streaming client for iPad, the free Instant Video app, doesn’t run correctly on jailbroken iPads. Amazon yesterday released the program which enables its $79-a-year Prime subscribers and regular users to easily stream and synch via an iPad their video purchases and thousands of movies and television shows the company has on offer…
* Tim Carmody, reporting for The Verge, sheds more light on the matter:
* One of The Verge’s readers downloaded the new Instant Video app to his iPad, which was running a Cydia-enabled jailbroken version of iOS 5.1.1. The reader contacted Amazon customer support, who confirmed that the application triggers an error on jailbroken iPads and that the error message sent to Amazon indicated that the reader’s device had been jailbroken.
* According to an email exchange between an Amazon support rep and the user, the latter was advised to talk to the jailbreak provider about a solution.
* Apparently, the author explains, “the presence of either the APT encryption key manager or the Cydia app store appears to be a factor”.
* Here’s that email message.

* There’s also a slight possibility of Amazon intentionally breaking the app on jailbroken devices as to prevent folks from tampering with its digital-rights management system used to copy-protect video content, though that’s a stretch.
* If you’re running a jailbroken device, let us know down in the comments how the Instant Video app runs on your system.
