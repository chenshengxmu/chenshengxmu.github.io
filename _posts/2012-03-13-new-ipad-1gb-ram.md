* Tinhte, the Vietnamese tech blog who got its hands of the new iPad and released the first unboxing video earlier today, put Apple’s new tablet to the test and posted the Geekbench benchmarks of the device.
* The results confirm earlier reports that the new iPad would sport 1GB of RAM, double that of the iPad 2. The benchmark also reveals that the new iPad has the same 1GHz CPU which can be found in the A5 chip…
* The new iPad scored a score of 756, which is on par with what the iPad 2 scored, but as MacRumors notes, those benchmarks only take into account processor and memory performances, without putting graphics capabilities to the test, which really is all the meat of the new A5X chip.
