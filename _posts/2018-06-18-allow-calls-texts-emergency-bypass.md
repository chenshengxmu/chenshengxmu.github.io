* The Do Not Disturb feature on your device is a handy tool for those times when you need to unplug. But, if an emergency pops up, you still want calls or texts from certain contacts to get through.
* One way to do this is to add those contacts to your Favorites or create a new group for them. However, there is another way to allow those important phone calls and messages to come through by using the Emergency Bypass setting.
* Once enabled, the Emergency Bypass setting will allow phone calls, Facetime calls, and text messages too come through when you have Do Not Disturb turned on. And note, enabling Emergency Bypass will also override your iPhone’s silent switch.
* You must enable the calls and text messages separately. This gives you flexibility to allow all, just calls, or just text messages.
* 1) Open your Contacts app.
* 2) Select the contact you want to enable Emergency Bypass for.
* 3) Tap Ringtone.
* 4) At the top, move the Emergency Bypass slider to on (from gray to green).
* 5) Tap Done.

* After you enable the feature for calls, texts, or both, you can see that it is turned on, on that contact’s main page.

* You no longer have to move contacts into Favorites or create a special group just for them to receive calls and messages when Do Not Disturb is enabled. This simple way to let those who need to contact you helps ensure you won’t miss their communication.
* Do you already use the Emergency Bypass feature or are you planning to now? Let us know!
