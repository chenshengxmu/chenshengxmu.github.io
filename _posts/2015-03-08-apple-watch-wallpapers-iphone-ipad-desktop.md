* Tomorrow, Apple pulls off the veil on Apple Watch final details. With the “Spring Forward” event, several years of speculation finally come to a point. Last week, several final pieces of information were leaked, but many more questions still remain.
* Apple stands to completely disrupt the wearable device category, as it has done with both iPhone and iPad. While other competitors have the early jump, it could be possible for Apple Watch to become the new standard, to which all future wearable technologies are benchmarked. To celebrate, add these wallpapers today.
* The following set of images were submitted by dedicated iDB reader @ProfeJuANTONIO. The images are inspired by the Apple Watch interface and make a stunning Lock screen image.
