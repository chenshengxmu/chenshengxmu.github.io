* According to a new report, the next generation iPhone, the “iPhone 4S,” is rumored to be released in October, while the iPad 3 will see a regular yearly upgrade in the Spring.
* The report comes from both TiPB and Japanese site Macotakara, with TiPB providing a October 7th launch date. Both sites have claimed that the iPhone 4S will debut in October and that the iPad 3 would be released in the Spring of 2012…
* “According to sources, iPhone 4S which is based on iPhone 4(CDMA) and new iPad will be started produce since 1st week in September and will be shipped in late October.”
* Both sites suggest that Apple may very well introduce two iPhones this fall. The “iPhone 4S” would be identical to the iPhone 4 but with a faster processor and better cameras along with a cheaper, more affordable price tag. Whereas the “iPhone 5” which will see a complete revamp, will be a higher-end iPhone priced a bit higher than the 4S.
* An alleged 2048 x 1536 Retina Display iPad 3 won’t see the light of day until Spring of 2012, despite previous rumors, according to both sites.
