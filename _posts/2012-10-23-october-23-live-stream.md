* Apple earlier today updated the Apple TV interface with a new Apple Events section which contains a link to a live stream of today’s iPad mini press conference. The move prompting somewhat unusual speculation that the company will only provide a live stream as a courtesy to Apple TV owners. We provided some workaround solution at the bottom of this post and now Apple has made it official: you will be able to enjoy the live stream on either your Apple TV or by opening a page on Apple’s web site using the Safari browser on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Mac or Windows PC…
* As I noted earlier on Twitter, a new page dedicated to the October 23 event video just went live via the Apple Events home page.
* It reads:
* Watch a live video stream of the special event online or via Apple TV starting at 10:00 a.m. PDT.
* Apple notes that live streaming video requires Safari 4 or later on Mac OS X v10.6 or later; Safari on iOS 4.2 or later. Streaming via Apple TV requires second- or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.
* The press conference begins at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm Zulu time.
* So, Apple basically screwed us live bloggers, right?
* Not exactly.
* Plenty of people just don’t have the time to sit through the whole thing. Some are working today, others may have crappy Internet connection or are on a metered plan. We have no doubt in our mind that the vast majority of folks prefer text and images coupled with some fun facts and analysis.
* That’s what we’ll be providing here so stay tuned as iDownloadBlog brings you a comprehensive coverage of all the announcements related to today’s event and stay with us for some post-event tidbits and analysis.
