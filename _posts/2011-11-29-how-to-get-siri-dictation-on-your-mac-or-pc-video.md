* Earlier we told you about the update to TouchPad, a VNC remote control app for iOS devices. It’s a well known app in itself, but this latest update is sure to make a few people ecstatic.
* Indeed, Edovia — the highly esteemed developers behind this and other great apps, like Screens — has updated TouchPad to allow Siri dictation between an iPhone 4S and a Mac, Windows, or even Linux machine if that suits your fancy.
* Check out our video demonstration inside…
* As you can see, Siri dictation works fairly well between he iPhone 4S and the Mac. TouchPad worked flawlessly; the only stumbling blocks were Siri misinterpreting things coupled with my haphazard pronunciation.
* If you want to try it out, simply download TouchPad ($4.99), connect it to your Mac or PC, and get to talking.
