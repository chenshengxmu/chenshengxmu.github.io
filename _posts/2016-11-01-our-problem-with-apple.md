title: Our problem with Apple
---
* Chuq Von Rospach has a great piece about how Apple could have avoided much of the controversy following last week’s Mac event. It’s a great read, but the one line I will remember is that one:
* We demand Apple innovate, but we insist they don’t change anything.
* This truly resonated with me because it’s a feeling I’ve had for a long time but never was able to express in a clear and simple manner. Chuq did in in just eleven words.
* Read the whole piece when you have a few minutes.
