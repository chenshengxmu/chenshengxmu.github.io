title: How iOS 8 Time-lapse video capture works

* iOS 8′s new Time-lapse video capture mode is a lot smarter than it sounds on first blush. Instead of taking individual images at predetermined intervals, it instead snaps photos at “dynamically selected intervals,” according to Apple’s website.
* But what exactly does this mean?
* As discovered by Dan Provost of Studio Neat, this under appreciated iOS 8 feature doubles the speed of the Time-lapse and takes half as many pictures per second as the recording duration doubles.
* This ensures that any Time-lapse you capture ends up being between 20 and 40 seconds long, “an ideal shareable length,” Provost writes. It’s just one of the many ways the power of iOS 8 software makes you a better photographer.
* Provost took it upon himself to examine just how Time-lapse video capture in iOS 8 determines the dynamically selected intervals so he did a couple tests shooting Time-lapse videos for various durations.
* You can check out his findings in the table below.

* For instance, recording a Time-lapse for five minutes generates a 30FPS video about twenty seconds long, as evidenced by the unedited clip below.
* He then went about recording another Time-lapse for 40 minutes and ended up with a 20-second clip seen below. For those wondering, the Time-lapse below is eight times faster than the previous five-minute video, and a whopping 120 times faster than the original version shot in real-time.
* Again, thanks to iOS 8’s clever handling of Time-lapse video capture, you always end up with optimal results in the form of a video between 20-40 seconds — perfect for sharing online.
* Apple is obviously taking into account attention span stats here.
* According to a survey conducted January 2014 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, the average length watched of a single Internet video is 2.7 minutes.
* In a true Apple fashion, iOS 8’s Time-lapse feature lacks any option to play with. If you find this annoying, there are always third-party apps.
* For example, Studio Neat’s own $4.99 Frameographer software (seen below) lets you adjust the speed and frame rate for Time-lapse videos after all the frames are shot.

* And of course, you should also check out Instagram’s Hyperlapse (pictured further below), a free iPhone app solely dedicated to capturing beautiful Time-lapses.

* So, how do you like Time-lapse video capture in iOS 8 so far?

* Is it something you’ll be using sporadically or just a marketing gimmick that will soon wear off, do you think?
* I’ve always liked Time-lapses, but don’t think I’ll be creating them because best results are achieved by using a tripod, which I don’t own.
