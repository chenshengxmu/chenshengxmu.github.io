* 9to5mac reports Apple is working on a new version of its Apple TV set-top box, which will feature a slimmer profile and finally bring the most sought-after Apple TV feature – the App Store.
* The publication, who is often correct in its reporting on Apple, reports that Apple had originally hoped to ship the redesigned Apple TV this month, however it could be delayed until later this year. Apple is said to be working on new content partnerships, like the reported HBO Now, and it could be the company wants to secure a few more before bringing the redesign to market.
* The new Apple TV is also said to have a redesigned, more capable and tactile remote control for controlling content and navigating the App Store. It’s not clear how the App Store would work, but presumably developers would have to submit apps through the Developer Center to be approved.
* There’s no word on if Apple plans to move away from its current $99 pricing for the Apple TV.
* It sounds like Apple has quite the fall lineup with the Apple TV and iPad Pro.
