* Apple’s latest ‘Do Not Disturb While Driving’ mode is another important step towards minimizing interaction with your iPhone behind the wheel and, more widely, an asset for road safety.
* The idea behind the mode is evident in its name: with the possible exception of urgent notifications from your loved ones, your iOS 11-equipped iPhone offers to act as a gatekeeper to suppress most distracting alerts. That way, it is ensured that your attention lies on the road and on the road only.
* Flicked on, favorite contacts of yours will be greeted with the matter-of-factly, yet impersonal I’m driving with Do Not Disturb While Driving turned on. I’ll see your message when I get where I’m going line.
* If that does not sound like your kind of jargon, follow these simple steps to personalize the stock reply.

* 5) When completed, save the auto-message by selecting Do Not Disturb in the top left corner and going back to the superordinate tab. Done and dusted.
* Incidentally, your Auto Reply does not seem to be capped by a (tight) character limit. I have not been asked to shorten my rather lengthy message yet, which indicates that if there is a limitation, it’s pegged far beyond the traditional 140 character threshold.
* If you are employing an iPhone for business purposes, you could also consider filling the Auto Reply box with a business card like message similar to a signature supplementing your emails. In that event, be sure to adjust the Auto Reply To box from Favorites to All Contacts.
* That’s all there is to know! Be safe on the roads.
