* Itching to run the latest macOS beta, but don’t want to upgrade your primary Mac installation with a beta release? You’d be wise to carefully consider the prospects of running a beta release as a daily driver. That said, it is possible to run beta software on your primary machine without compromising your current installation.
* By creating a small test partition on your primary drive, you can create a great landing space for the beta. Read and watch our walkthrough to see how easy it is.
* In this post, we will take the example of installing a beta version of OS X El Capitan, but note that the concept is the same regardless of what you are trying to install on that new partition.
* Step 1: Download the beta software you want to install.
* Step 2: Open Disk Utility.
* Step 3: Select your hard drive and click the Partition tab.
* Step 4: Click the ‘+’ sign to create a new partition.
* Step 5: Resize the partition using the drag handles to the desired size. I used 35GB, and was fine, as OS X El Capitan only takes around 12-13 GB for installation
* Step 6: Name your new partition El Capitan, or whatever you see fit.
* Step 7: Ensure the Format is Mac OS Extended (Journaled).
* Step 8: Click Apply and click Partition to create your partition.
* Step 9: Close Disk Utility.
* Step 10: Launch the OS X 10.11 El Capitan installer.
* Step 11: Click Continue → Agree → Agree → Show All Disks… and select your El Capitan disk and click Install
* Step 12: If requested, input your administrator password
* Your computer will now restart. Once it reboots, the installation will proceed on your new partition. The installation does take some time, like a normal installation, so just be patient. Once the installation completes, go through the normal OS X setup process to complete the initial setup.
* Once the installation and setup is completed, you’ll be able to boot between your primary installation and the new one containing the beta software.
* Would you consider installing a beta version of an operating system on a secondary test partition?
