* Now that Electra has been publicly available for a few weeks, we’re beginning to see more iOS 11-oriented jailbreak tweaks in the Cydia Store. That aside, there’ve been plenty of jailbreak tweaks for iOS 10 and earlier added to the mix.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks released throughout the past week. As always, we’ll start things off by talking about our favorites in detail and then we’ll outline the rest afterward.

* BoostedWifi is a simple add-on for jailbroken iPhones and iPads that allows you to see more about your local Wi-Fi networks at a glance.
* The tweak removes the lower-limit signal restriction so that you can see more Wi-Fi networks around you, and more importantly, it shows you the RSSI (received signal strength indicator) level so that you can tell just how strong or weak a Wi-Fi signal actually is.
* It’s an overall great add-on for jailbroken device users, especially those with any interest in networking.
* If you’d like to learn more about BoostedWifi, then check out our full review.

* The battery indicator is one of the most distinguishable Status Bar icons there is, but it doesn’t come with any color customizations out of the box. That’s where a new jailbreak tweak called ColorMyBattery comes in.
* When you install this tweak, you can customize battery level indicator colors in increments of 10%. That said, you can have a certain icon color for 91-100% battery, another for 81-90%, another for 71-80%, and so on.
* The tweak offers users a potentially mesmerizing aesthetic experience, so we’d recommend checking it out. As usual, you can read our full review to learn more about how it works and why we recommend it.

* The iPhone X has a wonderful OLED display, but the notch at the top caused Apple to compromise with some serious space savings. Unfortunately, that meant cutting out the popular battery percentage feature on the flagship handset.
* PercentageBatteryX is the ultimate solution, as it integrates the numeric battery percentage right into the battery level indicator icon in the Status Bar.
* With no space wasted, the tweak makes it easy to see your battery level without having to open Control Center, and it looks great too.
* You can learn more about PercentageBatteryX and how to get it in our full review.

* The iPhone X’s wonderfully-tall display is great for reading e-books and viewing websites, but so much vertical space gets wasted by how Apple formatted the tab bar on the device.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called Saw fixes this problem by shifting everyone downward dozens of pixels. Furthermore, it automatically hides the Home Bar in circumstances where it’d conflict with the tabs at the bottom of the display.
* While the amount of screen real estate gained is marginal at best, every little bit counts and we can’t recommend the tweak enough.
* You can learn more about Saw and why you should download it in our full review post.
