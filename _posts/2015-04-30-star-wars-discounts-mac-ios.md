* With only five days left until the annual Star Wars Day celebration (May the Fourth Be With You, says the marketing tagline), Aspyr Media is celebrating the occasion in advance by temporarily slashing five premium Star Wars titles for the Mac by fifty percent.
* The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars: Empire At War, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed games have gone half price each, in some cases even lower, on the Mac App Store. Put together, these downloads normally sell for a combined $70, so you’re looking at a cool $40 saved if you download the five Mac games while this promotion lasts.
* As a bonus, the iPhone and iPad edition of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has dropped temporarily from the usual $9.99 a pop to as low as a cool $2.99.
* Your download links are right below.
* Star Wars Mac discounts on the Mac App Store
* Star Wars iOS discounts on the App Store
* These downloads typically weigh in at more than a gigabyte each so you’ll want to leave them downloading overnight unless you’re on a speedy broadband connection.

* Most of these titles haven’t been discounted that deeply for a long time. This is especially true in the case of The Force Unleashed, which has dropped to its lowest price to date on the Mac App Store.
* Another example: Knights of the Old Republic (shown above) never got discounted to $2.99 on the App Store since its May 2013 debut, until today. By the way, the iPhone and iPad game currently enjoys a very good rating of four out of five starts based on more than seven-thousand App Store ratings posted by players.
* Will you be taking advantage of this promotion, do you think?
