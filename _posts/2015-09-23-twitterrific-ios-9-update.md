* Twitterrific 5, The Iconfactory’s freemium Twitter client for iOS and OS X platforms, has received its iOS 9-focused update this morning.
* The app is now fully optimized for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices running iOS 9 and supports new Slide Over and Split View multitasking modes on compatible iPads. If you own an iPad Air 2 or an iPad mini 4, you can now run Twitterrific and another app side-by-side in iOS 9’s new Split View mode.
