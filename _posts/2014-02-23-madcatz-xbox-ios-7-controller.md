* Mobile World Congress, which has just begun in Barcelona, is not known for churning out mobile peripherals like CES or other big conferences, but we’ve got one for you today. It’s a new MFi (made for iPhone) iOS 7-compatible game controller.
* It’s a wireless controller, with a removable clip for docking your device, and it’s called the ‘C.T.R.L.i.’ It’s made by Mad Catz, and if you have ever shopped around for third-party PC and console peripherals, you know that’s a fairly well-known name…
* Engadget was able to go hands-on with the device in Barcelona:
* “If the C.T.R.L.i looks familiar, that’s because it’s basically the same as the accessory maker’s award-winning MLG Pro Circuit controller for Xbox 360. Swapping consoles for handhelds, Mad Catz has introduced a spring-loaded mount to cater for Apple’s current iPhone range and any larger devices it may or may not decide to launch in the near future (cough, 5-inch iPhone, cough). The clip is fixed with a tiny screw, allowing iPad gamers to play wirelessly without fear of a giant clip obstructing their view. In the past, iOS 7 controllers have been called out for their high price and low build quality, but in our short time with the C.T.R.L.i prototype, we were impressed with how stable the controller remained while we played, and our iPhone looked to be in no danger of falling out.”
* And CNET managed to grab video showing the C.T.R.L.i in action:
* The iOS 7 controller space is finally starting to fill up, but we’ve yet to see anyone take the lead. Both Logitech and MOGA were first to market, but came in with high price tags and poor build quality. Steel Series’ RP One looks promising, but it’s tiny in size.
* So Mad Catz actually has a real shot at being successful. I’m liking the dual analog sticks, and just the layout of the controller in general, and the fact that it features a removable clip. That let’s you game on your iOS device from afar, or up-close.
* I’m anxious to see how the C.T.R.L.i fairs when it launches publicly in April. Engadget says it’ll come in black, white, blue, red, orange and will carry an $80 price-tag—which is cheaper than most controllers start out at, but still too high for impulse buyers.
* What do you think of Mad Catz’ upcoming iOS 7 controller?
