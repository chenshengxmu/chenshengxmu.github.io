title: Apple to seek $3B in damages from Samsung
---
* Apple will seek $3 billion in damages from Samsung when the two companies meet in court on Friday, a Korean newspaper reports Wednesday. The amount is triple that awarded in August, when a California jury ruled the South Korean firm violated Apple’s patents.

* According to the Korea Times, citing a “reliable source,” Apple will ask for the $3 billion because the iPhone maker “wants to quickly address the harm that Samsung’s infringing products are said to be causing.” If granted, the $3 billion would mark a record reward for technology patent lawsuits…
* Samsung is expected to respond to Apple’s demands by Oct. 19, filing papers with U.S. Federal Judge Lucy Koh in a Californian court. A final hearing is then expected to take place on December 6.
* In late August, Apple informed the court it seeks to have eight Samsung handsets banned from sales in the US. In a telling comment, the insider source told the Korean newspaper “Apple is pressing its full advantage over the jurors’ decision.” We will have to wait until Oct. 19 to hear Samsung’s response in court.
* There has already been fallout from the August verdict against Samsung. Apple reportedly is considering reducing its parts orders from Samsung. Also, the newly-released iPhone 5 has broken sales records ahead of the all-important Christmas buying season.
* What do you think? Is Apple ‘pressing its advantage’ — or just pressing its luck with Samsung?
