* Using custom lists in Microsoft Excel on your Mac makes tedious data entry quick and easy. And, drop-down lists are no different. You can create one in just a few clicks.
* Drop-down lists in Excel are ideal for limiting the options for cell entries. They come in handy for selecting items like colors, sizes, products, people, days, and so much more.
* Here’s how to quickly create a drop-down list in Excel on Mac.
* Open Microsoft Excel and the document where you want to add the drop-down list. Then, follow these steps.
* 1) Enter your list items onto a spreadsheet. You can use a new sheet in your workbook or existing cells where you have the items entered.
* 2) Click the cell where you want to insert the drop-down list.
* 3) Open the Data tab and click Data Validation from your ribbon.
* 4) In the pop-up window, click the Settings button.
* 5) Under Validation criteria > Allow, select List.

* 6) Click inside the Source box and then drag through the cells that should appear in the drop-down list. (You can also type in the cell range yourself if you’re comfortable with the format.)
* Note that the pop-up window will minimize as you perform this action. When you release the cursor at the end of the cells you’re selecting, the window will maximize again.

* 8) Click OK.

* If you want to use the same drop-down list options across a whole column or row, this is simple. Select the entire column by clicking the letter at the top or the entire row by clicking the number on the left.
* Then, follow the same steps as above beginning with Step 2 for the Data tab and Data Validation button.

* Adding a drop-down list to your spreadsheet is convenient for selecting from several pre-determined items. And, you can create multiple drop-down lists for different items all on one sheet.
