* Rejoice, iPad Pro users; GarageBand has finally been updated to accommodate the additional real estate provided by the iPad Pro’s massive 12.9″ screen. Not only that, but the release also adds support for 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s.
* All in all, the “2.1” isn’t really indicative as to how big of a release this is. Have a look at the full change log for a glance into how much effort was put into this latest update.

* As you can see, that’s a pretty gargantuan update for a “point” release. If you’re a big fan of GarageBand, you’ll be wanting to download this right now.
