* As most of you know by now, Facebook acquired Instagram, the popular photo sharing service, for a cool $1 billion, about four years ago. The company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the cheerful announcement from his Facebook page.
* But not everyone was excited about the buyout. In fact, when that happened, a lot of folks told us that they’d plan on ditching their Instagram accounts now that the social network is in charge. So we’ve put together this easy guide on how to do download your Instagram photos, and close your account if you decide to…
* Before you cancel your account, you’ll want to make sure and save your pictures. Luckily, there is a free service called Instaport that enables you to export your Instagram photos both quickly and easily.
* Simply login to the Instaport website with your Instagram credentials and you’ll be given the option to export your vintage coffee photos to your Flickr account, or download them to your hard drive.
* Now that you’re photos are backed up, you can safely delete your Instagram account. Do this by visiting the service’s account removal request page and entering in your account information. This is a point of no return, so you’ll want to be sure about this before moving forward.
* And that’s all there is to it. No more Instagram.
* That being said, it’s interesting the see how many people actually considered leaving Instagram over the Facebook acquisition. Now that several years have gone by, it’s safe to say Instagram is more popular than ever. True to Zuckerberg’s press release from back in the day, the service has remained largely unchanged.
