* Cybernetic is a recently released jailbreak tweak that allows you to alter the way banner notifications work. For instance, if you tap on a banner, you can make the banner dismiss instead of opening the app associated with the notification.
* If you’re looking to change some of the options when it comes to banner notifications, then look no further than Cybernetic. Check inside for our hands-on video walkthrough.
* If you’d like to swipe down — called pan in Cybernetic’s settings — in order to open the associated app, then you can do so by enabling the ‘Pan to launch App’ setting in the tweak’s preferences. Cybernetic also allows you to enable a ‘No more banners’ option to completely get rid of all notification banners.

* Cybernetic works pretty much exactly as advertised, and can be had free of charge via Cydia’s ModMyi repo. If you decide to take this tweak for a test spin, then by all means do so, and don’t forget to share your experience in the comment section below.
