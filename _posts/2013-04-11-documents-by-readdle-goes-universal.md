* The App Store carries some handy programs for folks who need to edit Microsoft Office documents on their iPhone and iPad. If Google’s acquisition of the popular app Quickoffice came as a shock and you were looking to jump ship, Readdle has you covered with today’s update to their free Documents software. The application, which is now universal, has at last been updated with support for the iPhone and iPod touch.
* Although Documents won’t let you edit Microsoft Office documents, you can now view Word, Excel and PowerPoint files on any iOS device you happen to own.
* Plus, Documents comes with lots more features to help you manage a bunch of file types, it syncs with popular cloud storage services, comes with a beautiful media player and lets you even annotate PDFs…
* The interface looks pretty on the iPhone.

* In addition to the aforementioned, the document/media management capabilities include searching inside documents, editing text files, reading books, accessing web articles and saving them for later and more.

* Its in-built media player supports photos, movies and music.
* And thanks to integration with iCloud, Dropbox and Box, you can sync your stuff across devices. You can also password-protect your files, share them with friends on social networks, store email attachments and download documents from URLs.
* All told, Documents is a pretty versatile piece of software and one of my favorite file managers on iOS.
* Here’s a quick video tour of the iPad build from three months ago.
* Documents is free to download from the App Store.
* On a related note, Google recently updated Quickoffice with iPhone support as well.
* Isn’t competition a good thing?
* Readdle also makes Scanner Pro and Printer Pro, both staples in their respective category. Last month, the company rebranded its popular calendar app Calendars+ as Calendars and released a free version that  includes many of its major features.
* If you can’t live without file managers (to the extent of limitations imposed by the iOS design), you should also check out the excellent Files app from German developer Sonico Mobile.
* Are there other iOS file manager apps, besides Documents and Files, that you think our readers should know about?
