* Believe it or not, Steve Wozniak is set to appear as a playable character in an upcoming iOS game alongside actor Danny Trejo. In fact, the Apple co-founder is headlining the title with the Machete/Con Air actor entitled, “Danny Trejo’s Vengeance: Woz with a Coz.” More details after the break…
* The game, which was first announced by Deadline Hollywood, is setup as a marketing tool for Danny Trejo’s upcoming film: Danny Trejo’s Vengeance. In the movie, Trejo plays a retired undercover cop who is wrongfully jailed after his family is murdered. Upon his release, he becomes a violent vigilante.
* So where does ol’ Steve Wozniak come in? According to the press release (via CNET), Woz teams up with Trejo in the game to rescue his wife, Janet, who has been kidnapped:
* “In “Woz with a Coz” on iOS, the Apple co-founder and his wife, “J-Woz,” are enjoying their evening together, taking a glide. Unfortunately, their otherwise quiet evening is ruined — not by a competitive product release — but rather by street thugs kidnapping “J-Woz”!!! Your dynamic duo of Steve and Danny must hurry and swing into action as they tear up Fusion City in their quest to rescue “J-Woz,” and maybe cause a little mayhem on their way…”
* Wozniak, as most of you know, is the outspoken co-founder of Apple, who left the company back in 1987. He currently works for computer hardware and software systems company Fusion-io as their chief scientist. Danny Trejo is an ex-con-turned-movie extra, who now has more than 200 film/TV credits.
* It’s unclear what the game’s exact date of release is, but judging by the above promotional art, we’re guessing it’s going to be sometime around November 22nd. It’s also unknown at this time what the title’s price tag is going to be, and whether or not it will be released on any other platforms outside of iOS.
* So, anyone excited for Woz with a Coz?
