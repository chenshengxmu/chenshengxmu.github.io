* As is their wont, Chinese knockoff manufacturers are hard at work building and releasing iPhone 8 clones as we’re inching closer toward the handset’s reported September 21 unveiling.
* Such Android-powered handsets are created solely from leaked specifications, design drawings, fan renderings and rumor-mill reporting. They’re not really fooling anyone with cloned phones, but clearly there’s a market for them. In fact, I’d say that iPhone knockoffs constitute an unavoidable part of the spectacle that surrounds any new iPhone introduction.
* Here’s a video showing an iPhone 8 clone, as posted on leak aggregator SlashLeaks.
* The knockoff device is running Android with a custom skin, icons and animations to make it resemble iOS more closely. You can tell straight away that this is it’s not a real Apple prototype device so we’re posting this video purely for the sake of discussion.
* Have you ever seen a working Chinese iPhone clone?
