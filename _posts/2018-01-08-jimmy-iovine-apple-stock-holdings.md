* Jimmy Iovine may be leaving Apple after the shares he acquired as part of the $3 billion Beats deal vest fully later this year. According to Variety this morning, the executive stands to make a small fortune as soon as his Apple stock fully vests in August 2018.
* Using the metric of a 19% average rise over three-and-a-quarter years, Iovine’s Apple stock would be worth about $700 million today, the sum he would presumably share with Dr. Dre.
* Apple in 2014 acquired Beats Electronics LCC for $3 billion, turning Iovine and his longtime friend and business partner Dr. Dre into billionaires.
* Apple paid $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in stock for Beats.
* From the report:
* Of course, with a market cap in excess of $900 million (nearly $1 trillion, at current share prices) Beats, Apple Music, Beats Radio 1 and additional initiatives by Iovine and his team are ‘a tiny blip’ in the Apple ecosystem, says one insider, as is a payout of nearly $1 billion.
* Another source says Iovine’s plan was always to exit once hitting the last of his exercise options over a three-year vesting period. He could, however, continue to work with Apple in a consulting role.
* The report notes that Iovine, 64, has not yet decided whether he will be leaving Apple once his stock vests. He holds no official title at the Cupertino technology giant.
* Dr. Dre also has Apple stock holdings that are reportedly scheduled to vest along the same timeline, but his future plans are currently unknown.
