* While security researcher Luca Todesco may have retired from the jailbreak community, the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10 lives on in those of us who made the jump when we were told to do so.
* For those that are hanging onto their jailbreak, you might’ve noticed that there have been some attention-worthy jailbreak tweak releases this week, and in this roundup, we’ll go over all of them starting with our favorites.
* Confero 2 – $1.99

* Confero 2 is quite an amazing tweak in that it will let you group all apps with unread notification badges in one place.
* Since badges are often overlooked and clutter the Home screen in undesirable ways, this offers a decent solution to the ongoing badge clutter “problem” that many people complain about.
* It provides users with a unique interface that can be viewed by tapping on a Status Bar icon. After revealing the interface, it’s easy to interact with apps that you have missed notifications from and handle your notifications.

* SpecialFaces – FREE

* Jailbreakers who use an Apple Watch are no longer limited to the Apple Watch faces that came with the device from the factory.
* A new beta tweak called SpecialFaces enables the Hermes and Nike Apple Watch faces on your jailbroken iPhone from the Apple Watch app and then lets you apply them to any Apple Watch you might have, whether it’s the normal stainless steel model, the Sport, or even the Edition model.
* The tweak isn’t perfect just yet, as there are some glitches, but it’s still a great proof of concept that shows porting these watch faces to unsupported devices is at least possible.
* You can read our full review on SpecialFaces to learn more about how it works.
* Springtomize 4 – $4.99

* One of the most notable jailbreak tweak releases of the week was Springtomize 4, which is the all-inclusive SpringBoard customization tweak that’s been hyped up since the conception of the iOS 10 jailbreak.
* This tweak offers so many customization options for various parts of your iPhone that it’s often considered the one-stop-shop for all jailbreakers. There are more than 100 different options to configure for almost every part of the iOS UI.
* You can learn more about what can be configured in our full review.
* WeatherLock – $0.99

* WeatherLock is a pretty neat tweak that replaces the Lock screen’s typical wallpaper with the weather animations from the Weather app.
* It uses Apple’s own weather animations, which are battery efficient in their nature, and it uses your current location’s weather conditions to display the proper kind of weather animations for you at any given time of the day.
