title: iOS 6- Maps video demonstration
---
* The new Maps app is the premier new feature in iOS 6. Although I was a bit skeptical at first after seeing some early screenshots, I’m a definite believer after giving it some hands-on time. It is rightfully so that the new Maps app is Apple’s most compelling upgrade to iOS.
* Maps is leaps and bounds above anything offered in the previous Google powered Maps app. With 3D views, turn by turn navigation, and full integration with Siri, Maps is a truly amazing package. What do you think about it?
