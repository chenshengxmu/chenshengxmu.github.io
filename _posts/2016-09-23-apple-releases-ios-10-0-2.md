* Apple has released a small update for compatible iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads on Friday dubbed iOS 10.0.2 that fixes a handful of small bugs introduced with the initial release of iOS 10.
* iOS 10.0.2 is recommended for all users who just upgraded to iOS 10, however if you’re jailbroken, then you should obviously say far away as there isn’t a jailbreak available just yet for iOS 10.
* This update fixes a bug related to headphone audio controls not working, a bug that could make the Photos app quit unexpectedly, and yet another bug that could prevent you from using some of your favorite app extensions.
* The full change log is available below:
* • Addresses an issue that could prevent headphone audio controls from temporarily not working • Resolves an issue that caused Photos to quit for some users when turning on iCloud Photo Library • Fixes an issue that prevented enabling some app extensions
* The firmware file is available on our downloads page and you can update through both iTunes and the iOS over the air (OTA) updating service in Settings → General → Software Update.
* iOS 10.0.2 can be installed on all of the following devices:
* Did the update go smoothly for you? Let us know in the comments!
