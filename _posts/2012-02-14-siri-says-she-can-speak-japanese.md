* Last week we told you about a rumor that Siri might be available in Chinese, Japanese, Russian and other languages soon, which Apple had already promised on their Siri support page.
* But today, new evidence came out that Siri is indeed going to support Japanese soon, as Siri herself was able to confirm…
* If you ask Siri what languages she speaks, she will answer that she can speak French, English Japanese and German. So here you go. even though Siri can’t understand or speak Japanese quite yet, she’s been set up to say she does. Who knows, maybe it will be part of next month’s iPad announcement?
* Not a groundbreaking news in itself, but I’m sure our Japanese friends will be quite pleased about it.
