* The release of the Pangu jailbreak for iOS 7.1.x last month was both a gift and a curse. It brought about a way for folks to jailbreak the latest iOS firmware, but it also broke a lot of popular packages in Cydia.
* Several developers have already updated their tweaks to work with 7.1.x, and today we’re adding another one to the list (sort of). Intelliborn has posted a beta version of IntelliScreenX with support for 7.1.x…
* For those unfamiliar with the tweak, ISX is a utility for your Lock screen that gives you information and allows you to perform actions without unlocking your device. It first debuted in October 2011 for iOS 5.
* For further reference, here’s our IntelliScreenX7 video walkthrough:
* And as for the latest beta with iOS 7.1.x support, here’s Intelliborn:
* ISX 7.10.3 (with 7.1.x support) is in our beta repo (Add Cydia Source “intelliborn .com/betaisx” (without the space). Thanks!

* So to snag the beta, simply add Intelliborn’s beta repo in Cydia by tapping on the Sources tab > Edit > Add and typing in intelliborn.com/betaisx. From here you can install the latest build of IntelliScreenX.
* ISX comes with a free 3-day trial, and costs $4.99, $7.99 or $9.99 after that depending on which (if any) previous versions you owned. An official release with support for 7.1.x should hit Cydia’s ModMyi repo soon.
