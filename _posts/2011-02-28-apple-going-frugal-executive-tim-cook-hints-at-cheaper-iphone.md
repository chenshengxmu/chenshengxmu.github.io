title: Apple Going Frugal? Executive Tim Cook Hints at Cheaper iPhone

* During an interview with Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, Apple COO and acting CEO, Tim Cook, again fueled rumors of a cheaper iPhone.
* Cook mentioned that he wanted Apple to be a company “for everyone,” and not “just for the rich.”
* If Cook’s words sound familiar, remember that earlier this month rumors abounded about a cheaper iPhone Nano. Is this Apple just having fun with the latest rumors, or is there real truth behind this story?
* Now lets not get ahead of ourselves here, the iPhone Nano rumors have been running rampant for years, and nothing ever came about it.
* But I have to admit, it’s interesting to hear an executive specifically comment on Apple’s ability to cater to a demographic without a large disposable income.
* Cook went on to say that Apple is doing “clever things” (note: cloud storage, anyone?)  in an attempt to get a foot in on the pre-paid market, and that Apple is not “ceding any market.”
* This again fuels rumors of a smaller, perhaps more disposable iPhone for the masses. The latest iPhone Nano rumors correlate very well with Cook’s latest comments, and make it evident that it’s only a matter of time before Apple enters the pre-paid market.
* Culminating all of the rumors, along Apple’s latest thoughts on the matter, I think it’s safe to say that we will definitely see an iPhone Nano within the next year.
* What do you think?
