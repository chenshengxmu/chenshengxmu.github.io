* Snapchat today unveiled augmented reality games in the latest version of its mobile app.
* Called Snappables and found alongside Lenses in Snapchat’s latest update, this feature allows you to play augmented reality-powered games with your friends using touch, motion and even facial expressions.
* “Fight aliens, start a rock band, play basketball and more—together with your friends, no matter where you are,“ said the company.
* To play an augmented reality game with a friend, launch into your Snapchat camera, tap anywhere on the screen to pull the Lenses interface up, then select a Snappable to play. Because Snappables live right where Lenses do, Snapchat is hoping that by putting this feature front and center will increase its stickiness.
* You can invite your friends to play along at any time. Some Snappables even allow you to challenge friends to beat your high score, while others can invite them to multiplayer games! To get your head in the game, so to speak, you will need to update your copy of Snapchat to the most recent version.
* New Snappables will be released every week.
* Download Snapchat for iOS from App Store.
