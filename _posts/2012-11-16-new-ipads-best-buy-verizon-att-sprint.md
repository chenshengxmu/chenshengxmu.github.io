* Cody told you earlier this morning that U.S. carrier Sprint started selling Apple’s iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad with Retina display in its retail stores. Not to be outdone by the nation’s #3 telco, carriers AT&T and Verizon announced that both Wi-Fi and cellular versions of the two tablets are now available across their retail and online stores in the United States. Additionally, we are hearing that Best Buy has the tablets and will begin selling them later today. Both carriers are offering the iPad mini and the fourth-gen full-size iPad with or without shared data service, with Sprint of course having the upper hand with its unlimited data offering (and limited 4G coverage).
* The devices have also arrived in Apple’s retail outlets. Some customers who pre-ordered their units saw their shipment delivered as early as yesterday or are seeing their packages out for delivery…
* AT&T wrote in a media release:
* “Our customers are increasingly connecting their devices to the mobile internet and our new Mobile Share plans allow them to add a tablet for just 10 dollars a month,” said Glenn Lurie, president, Emerging Enterprises and Partnerships, AT&T Mobility.
* “We’re thrilled to offer iPad mini to our customers on the nation’s largest 4G network.”
* The carrier offers the iPad mini with an instant $100 saving with a two-year contract and free shipping for online purchases. Availability is limited as the online AT&T store at press time estimated deliveries at 7-14 business days.
* Verizon’s iPad deals and price points are similar to those by AT&T and also include shared data plans, though the company did not issue a press release yet. At the time of this writing, Verizon was selling the new devices via its online store only.
* Sprint noted only select locations will be carrying the tablets and warned that demand outweighs supply. The carrier has a waiting list valid with a $50 gift card purchased that can be later redeemed against the cost of the tablet.
* We’ve noticed that Best Buy now offers Wi-Fi and cellular models of the fourth-gen iPad and the iPad mini on its online store.
* Last month, Apple said it sold more than three million new iPads during their first three days of availability.
* What’s iPad availability like at your local AT&T, Sprint or Verizon store?
