* iTunes Match, Apple’s $25 a year cloud locker and scan-and-match music service, is being rolled out in additional countries, according to web reports. Last time we heard, Apple expanded iTunes Match to 19 countries, with a focus on the Baltic states, Latin America and the Netherlands.
* Macstories first spotted that the iTunes terms and conditions for Italy have been updated with new terms suggesting an imminent launch in the country. Other web reports confirmed a similar changes to iTunes terms and conditions for Greece, Portugal, Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and other markets…
* The MacStories article has confirmed that iTunes Match is now live in Italy, priced at €24.99 a year, versus $24.99 in the United States.
* Greek iPhone confirms that the service has gone live in Greece as other outlets claim that iTunes Match is also a go-go in Austria, Slovenia and Portugal. With Italy and Austria now being iTunes Match-friendly, it’s a safe bet that Apple will flip the switch for the whole Euro zone anytime soon.
* As is the case with other markets where iTunes Match works, folks in these new countries should be able to use iTunes in the Cloud to re-download music and music video to their devices any number of times.
* Apple’s support document did not officially list the new iTunes Match-enabled markets at press time.
* Although the company in February indicated that iTunes Match would go live in Japan soon, the service is still nowhere to be seen in the country.
* I’m an iTunes Match subscriber and I’ve been loving the service a lot.
* In my opinion, iTunes Match is a pleasure to use.
* The service works like magic and without major intervention on the user’s part and is clearly what a music locker in the cloud should be.
* iTunes Match lets me access my music across network-enabled devices without too much fuss. It also gives me piece of mind in knowing that my iTunes purchases and matched songs are kept in a secure iCloud locker.
* Having any issues with iTunes Match?
