* Big news coming out of Cupertino today, Steve Jobs has requested, and has been granted a medical leave of absence. Apple’s website posted an email that Steve sent out to all Apple employees earlier today. His reasons stated for taking the leave is so that he can “focus on [his] health.”
* As you may remember, it wasn’t too long ago that Steve took a similar leave when he experienced health issues related to his liver, that being almost two years ago to the day…
* Apple CEO Steve Jobs today sent the following email to all Apple employees:
* Team,
* At my request, the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health. I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company.
* I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for all of Apple’s day to day operations. I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for 2011.
* I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can. In the meantime, my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy.
* Steve
* We’re not sure what type of impact this will have on Apple stock, if any at all, but since today is a federal holiday, any news about that will have to wait until tomorrow.
* All of us at iDB wish Steve a speedy recovery, and we look forward to seeing the eclectic CEO back on top of his game.
* [Apple]
