title: Is Google Voice for iPhone Finally Going to Be Reinstated?
---
* I am still kind of in disbelief about Appleâ€™s recent and sudden restriction removal regarding the App Store guidelines. Getting reports like the following from BGR make it very real in my eyes.

* Sean Kovacs, the developer of GV Mobile (Google Voice Mobile), has posted a tweet that all but says the once banned application will be likely gracing the presence of the virtual store. It reads:
* Good news: I did get confirmation back from Apple that it will most likely get back in once I resubmit.
* This is just the latest announcement coming from a previously restricted app and saying that under the new guidelines there is nothing to stop them. Adobe has reported similar experiences with Flash based apps being accepted.
* How many of you are ready for Google Voice to be back in the App Store? I know it gets a lot of press so I am curious to see how many people are actually awaiting its arrival. Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
