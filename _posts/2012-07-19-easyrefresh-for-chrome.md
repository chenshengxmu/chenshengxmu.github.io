* The way Google Chrome for iOS handles its refresh/stop functionality is a bit unorthodox. You have to first open a menu, and then tap the refresh or stop button to perform the action.
* While it may seem like a small deal, I’ve found that this extra step is a bit frustrating in real world usage. Thankfully, as you may have guessed, the jailbreak community has responded with an answer.
* EasyRefresh for Chrome is that answer — it’s a jailbreak tweak that adds a traditional refresh button to Google Chrome for iOS…
* EasyRefresh for Chrome is a free jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It features no options or settings, you’ll simply have a new refresh/stop button next to your address bar once it’s installed.
* Do you prefer this more traditional method of refreshing your browser, or can you live with the way Chrome does things?
