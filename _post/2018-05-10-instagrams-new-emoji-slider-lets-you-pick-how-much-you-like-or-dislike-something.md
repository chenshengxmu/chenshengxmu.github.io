* Instagram today unveiled a new poll-like Emoji Slider feature for your Stories.
* It lets your followers pick how much they like or dislike something in a Story by way of dragging the emoji to the left or right and watch it animate as they make their decision.
* Releasing the emoji sets their response (you’ll see the current average of how others have responded so far). Because these interactive sliders are part of Stories, the content will disappear from your feed and profile after 24 hours unless you add your Story as a Highlight.
* “By choosing an emoji for your question, you also add a layer of emotional context that helps those answering understand your tone and answer accordingly,” notes the company.
* Use the newly unveiled slider for those times when you’d like to pose more nuanced questions to your followers, such as how an artist’s new single is or how they like their food.
* To add an Emoji slider to your Story, choose it from the sticker tray after taking a photo or video. Like a sticker, this slider can be placed anywhere you’d like. Simply write out your question, set the emoji that best matches the mood of your question and you’re good to go.
* This cool new feature is available as part of Instagram 44.0 for iOS.
* Download Instagram from App Store for free.
