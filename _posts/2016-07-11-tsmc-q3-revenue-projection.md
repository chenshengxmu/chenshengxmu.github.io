* Citing market forecasts quoted by the Commercial Times newspaper, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported Monday that shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) could hit record levels thanks to orders for the Apple-designed ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip, the engine that will drive the next iPhone and iPad. TSMC just posted strong numbers for the second financial quarter.
* Consolidated revenues for the second quarter totaled NT$221.81 billion, or about $6.89 billion, beating the company’s guidance of NT$215-NT$218 billion ($6.67 billion-$6.77 billion).
* As mentioned, market watchers expect TSMC to see its third-quarter revenues climb to a record high of between NT$230 billion and NT$240 billion (between $7.14 billion and $7.45 billion), “buoyed by rising shipments of Apple’s A10 chips”.
* The company shares orders for the current generation A9 and A9X processors inside the latest iPhones and iPads with rival Samsung and is expected to lead A10 chip production.
* The A10 processor is expected to be even faster than the current generation while conserving power thanks to using TSMC’s 16nm FinFET manufacturing process and in-house developed backend integrated fan-out (InFO) wafer packaging.
