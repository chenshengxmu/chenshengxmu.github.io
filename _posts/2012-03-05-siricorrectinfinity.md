* SiriCorrectInfinity is a free jailbreak tweak available on Cydia that allows you to make text edits to Siri queries not once, but an infinite amount of times.
* Since a lot of people don’t know that you can edit Siri queries to beging with, it’s one of those things that’s best explained by seeing it for yourself.
* Check out our video walkthrough inside…
* SiriCorrectInfinity has no configurable options, just download and install it for free via Cydia’s ModMyi repo, and you’re good to go.
* This can be extremely helpful, especially when Siri refuses to understand what you say, and you happen to mistype the initial text correction.
* To use this tweak you will need either a legit Siri instance via the iPhone 4S, or use Spire on your older device.
