title: How to Turn Your iPhone Into A Wifi Hotspot
---
* I’ve always been a big fan of iPhone tethering, which has saved my butt a few times, especially during my travels. Today, a blog reader by the name of DarkN sent me a really nice tip about MyWi, a jailbreak app that allows you to both tether your iPhone AND create a Wifi Hotspot so you can share your Internet connection with computers around you.

* This has to be the most useful app I’ve seen in quite a while. I had heard about MyWi before but I thought it was only an app to tether your iPhone so I didn’t even look at it. But being able to use your iPhone as a wireless hotspot is just amazing!
* If you can’t see the benefits of using your iPhone as a wireless router, then let me give you an example. My fiancee and I are currently in Thailand. Unfortunately our hotel doesn’t offer wifi. I do however have a local SIM card and a data plan which I use to tether my iPhone. By creating a wifi hotspot with my iPhone, I literally turn it into a modem/wifi router and my fiancee can now connect to the internet with her iPod Touch.
* Step 1: Make sure your iPhone is jailbroken and that it is running at least OS 3.0.
* Step 2: Launch Cydia and search for “MyWi”. If you don’t have Rock installed on your iPhone and you don’t want it, choose the “MyWi (no Rock)” version.
* Step 3: Purchase ($9.99) and install MyWi then reboot your iPhone.
* Step 4: Launch MyWi and tweak the settings to your liking:
* That’s it. You should now be able to use your iPhone as a modem and share your internet connection with other computers or iPods around you.
* Note that using your iPhone as a wifi router is an absolute battery killer. Make sure it is plugged in so you don’t run out of juice in just a few minutes.
