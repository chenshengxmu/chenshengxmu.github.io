* They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So if Samsung created Apple’s awesome ‘Intention’ video (part of the new ‘Designed by Apple’ ad campaign), the results would no doubt look something like this…
* Here is the ‘Samesong’ clip, someone’s funny take on the ‘Designed by Apple’ thing.
* Rings true to me (via The Loop).
* For reference: Apple’s nice ‘Intention’ video that kicked off the WWDC 2013 keynote.

* In addition to the above video, Apple is also airing a nice mission-statement commercial that can be seen virtually everywhere, with print ads and more coming.
* I kinda hoped Samsung would never copy Apple’s next-gen Mac Pro because its friends in South Korea wrote it would exit the desktop biz altogether, but it turned out to be false.
* “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass!”
* Meet us in comments.
