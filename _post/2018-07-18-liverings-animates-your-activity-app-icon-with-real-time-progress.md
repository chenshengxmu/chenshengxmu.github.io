* If you take advantage of the fitness features available on your iPhone and Apple Watch, then you might be excited to learn about a new free jailbreak tweak called LiveRings by iOS developer CP Digital Darkroom.
* This tweak animates the Activity app icon on your Home screen so that it displays your actual ring activity in real-time, as shown above.
* With LiveRings, you can keep track of your ring progress without physically opening the Activity app, and it’s also a great way to show off your newly-jailbroken iOS 11 device.
* Given how other app icons animate and update in real-time, such as Calendar and Clock, LiveRings offers a great way to make up for an otherwise wasted opportunity by Apple to breathe new life into the Home screen.
* The effects of LiveRings are purely cosmetic, but it will require access to your HealthKit data to keep track of your physical activity and update the icon accordingly. You should see a popup for this after your initial installation, and it’s important that you allow it to access this data or the tweak won’t work as expected.
* You can download LiveRings for free from Cydia’s Packix repository, and it works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices. The developer says that LiveRings could theoretically also work on iOS 9.3 and later, but this isn’t confirmed.
* Will you be animating your Activity app with this tweak? Tell us why or why not in the comments section below.
