* Folks who missed Apple’s keynote this morning, or would just like to watch it in its entirety, will be happy to hear that Apple has just posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. Obviously, you can read everything you need to know about today’s event right here on iDB. But if you have the time, the video is definitely worth watching…
* Like the other videos Apple’s posted this afternoon, the event doesn’t appear to be available on YouTube yet, so we can’t embed it here. But for those who would like to watch the clip, you can find it on Apple’s website by clicking here. Just make sure you have QuickTime installed, or a similar player that supports QT files. Apple loves QuickTime.
* Personally, I felt like the event was a bit rushed. But Apple did make some huge announcements today: the iPhone 5s, its first handset made of plastic, iOS 7, the biggest update in the platform’s history, and the iPhone 5s, the only currently-sold smartphone to offer a built-in fingerprint sensor for fast and secure sign in.
* What did you think of today’s iPhone event?
