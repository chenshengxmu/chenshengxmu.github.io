* T-Mobile is sad that it doesn’t have the iPhone. With Sprint rumored to get the iPhone 5 next month, T-Mobile will be the only main carrier left out in the cold.
* T-Mobile Chief Marketing Office Cole Brodman has issued an open letter to all T-Mobile customers about the iPhone. Brodman makes it clear that T-Mobile values its customers and wants the iPhone on its network…
* “We’ve heard from many customers who love their T-Mobile service, but are disappointed that we don’t carry the iPhone. To these customers, first, thank you for your business.  Please know that we think the iPhone is a great device and Apple knows that we’d like to add it to our line-up. Today, there are over a million T-Mobile customers using unlocked iPhones on our network. We are interested in offering all of our customers a no-compromise iPhone experience on our network.”
* T-Mobile declined to make any comments about its negotiations with Apple, or when the iPhone could possibly make its way to the network. AT&T is currently in the process of trying to acquire T-Mobile, so that red tape may have interfered with Apple’s ability to offer the iPhone on T-Mobile’s network.
* Brodman touted T-Mobile’s line of Android handsets as phones that can “rival or beat” any other smartphone on the market.
* The iPhone 5 hasn’t hit the market.. yet. Just wait, T-Mobile.
