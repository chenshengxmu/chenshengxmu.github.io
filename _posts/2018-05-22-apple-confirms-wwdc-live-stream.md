* Apple is going to be providing a live stream of its WWDC keynote address this year. On Tuesday, the company added a new events page to its website with an invitation to “watch the keynote 6/4 at 10am PDT.”
* We are expecting Apple to use the event to offer up previews for the next major versions of its 4 platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. It’s also possible we could see Mac updates or other new products.
* You’ll of course be able to watch the keynote on iOS, Mac or Apple TV, but we also invite you to join us here at iDB. As usual we will be covering the event live, as well as all subsequent news through the day.
