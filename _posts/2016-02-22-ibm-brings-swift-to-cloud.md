* Swift, Apple’s new programming language for iOS and OS X development, was recently released to the community on an open-source basis and today computer giant IBM announced that it is bringing Swift to the cloud. As a result, people who write enterprise applications for the Mac, iPhone, iPod touch and iPad can now leverage the power of Apple’s modern programming language in writing server-side apps in Swift which support IBM’s cloud services.
* The move is important as it breaks down barriers between front-end and back-end development. Now programmers can write both device and server-side code in Swift, which should help accelerate the adoption of Swift as a programming language of choice for business and enterprise apps. The news makes IBM the first cloud provider to enable the development of business applications in native Swift code.
* “As one of the largest users of Swift for mobile app development, IBM has a deep understanding of the advantages of Swift and the knowledge to assist enterprises in maximizing the true potential that server-side Swift will provide,” reads the press release.
* Developers can access IBM’s new Swift Sandbox in a browser to test their code.
* Apps can be deployed using IBM’s Bluemix service or packaged for enterprise distribution to access IBM Cloud services using the Swift Package Catalog.
* In just two months since Apple open-sourced the Swift language, more than 100,000 developers from around the world have used IBM’s Swift Sandbox and more than half a million code runs have been executed in the Swift Sandbox to date, said IBM.
* More information can be found on IBM.com/Bluemix/Swift.
* IBM also unveiled Kitura, a new open source web server written in Swift and available on both OS X and Linux, which makes building end-to-end applications on Bluemix and quickly deploying them in enterprise a reality.
