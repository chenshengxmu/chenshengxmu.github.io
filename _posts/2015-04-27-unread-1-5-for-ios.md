* Unread, an RSS client for the iPhone and iPad originally created by Jared Sinclair and later acquired by Supertop, is getting a nice update this morning with several new features and a handful of bug fixes.
* Unread, which supports a number of popular feed services, now features a useful Share extension so you can now send links and text from any app easily rather than fiddle with a proprietary sharing menu.
* On the iPhone, the app will now reorient its user interface when you turn your device upside down. More importantly, Unread 1.5 for the iPhone and iPad at last supports Readability in the article view, letting you enjoy the full articles without ads, custom layouts, website navigation and other distractions.
* Fonts have been upgraded, too: now Cyrillic and Greek character sets are supported. If you use the popular password-management utility 1Password, Unread 1.5 now lets you set up your accounts and log into paywall’d sites in the browser using the 1Password extension.
* As depicted below, accessing the Share menu is as easy as swiping left anywhere within an article and then tapping the Share icon to access iOS 8’s multi-purpose share sheet with all your configured extensions.

* It’s also possible to highlight a passage of text from an article and tap and hold links to bring up the Share sheet.
* Our friend Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, was fairly impressed with today’s update, concluding in his review of Unread 1.5 that he loves “skimming headlines and reading long articles in Unread,” adding:
* The app has been cleverly designed for both experiences in mind: tasteful typographic choices make reading a focused and pleasant affair, but the option to display thumbnails and control font sizes in the article list helps those who just want to glance at headlines and move on.
* As I stated above, a Readability view can now fetch the full text from a truncated RSS feed, though I’ve experienced occasional hiccups with this feature in my brief hands-on time with the app over the weekend.
* If you want to set custom font sizes for Unread’s article view, visit the in-app settings. For those wondering, the team didn’t make Unread for Apple Watch because reading articles on Apple’s wrist computer “is just silly.”
* Unread 1.5 changelog:
* New:
* Changes:
* Fixes:
* The 8-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later.
* Unread for the iPhone and iPad is available on a freemium basis in the App Store.
