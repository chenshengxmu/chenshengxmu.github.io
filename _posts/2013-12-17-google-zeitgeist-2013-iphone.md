* Google’s Zeitgeist has become something of an annual tradition as the Internet giant wraps up each year by giving us a glimpse into what the world’s been searching for using its search engine. Surprisingly (or not?), Apple’s iPhone 5s took the top three slots in global search trends (#5 in the U.S.), behind Nelson Mandela and Paul Walker.
* Google’s review of 2013 searches also shows the iPhone 5s leading 2013 search trends in the Phones category, although it’s been edged out in the Gadgets category by Samsung’s Galaxy S4 and Sony’s PlayStation 4…
* Looking only at the Phone category, the iPhone 5s easily dominated the list of top 2013 Google searches, followed by Samsung’s Galaxy S4, the iPhone 5c, HTC’s One, Google’s Nexus 5, BlackBerry 10, Galaxy S4, Moto X, LG G2 and Nokia’s Lumia 1020.
* The Tech Gadgets category is ruled by the #1 PlayStation 4, followed by Samsung’s Galaxy S4, the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 5c, the iPad Air, the iPad mini, HTC’s One, Google’s $35 Chromecast dongle and the Nexus 5.
* Google says that folks around the world uploaded more than an unbelievable 1.7 million video versions of the Harlem Shake to YouTube – can you believe that? Harlem Shake was YouTube’s second most-trending video in 2013 and #5 on the global list.
* Another factoid: twerking topped this year’s ‘what is…’ list of search terms.
* In our annual Year-End Zeitgeist (“spirit of the times”), we reflect on the people, places, and moments that captured the world’s attention throughout the year.
