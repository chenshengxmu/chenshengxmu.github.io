* Apple’s new handset has been extremely popular since it launched last month. Carriers are still struggling to keep up with the demand for the device. To put things plainly: consumers love it.
* They love it so much, in fact, that many of them are willing to break their previous carrier contracts to get one. A recent study shows that some 45% of people surveyed paid an ETF to get their iPhone 4S…
* Marketing research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners recently surveyed 4,600 iPhone 4S owners across AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint networks in regards to how they came about the handset. The results of the query are actually pretty interesting.
* According to the research, a staggering 45% of the people surveyed broke their contract with their current or former wireless carrier to get their iPhone 4S. And 77% of those folks paid more than $100 in early termination fees (ETF) on top of the price of the device.
* Even though that sounds expensive, paying an ETF is typically the cheapest way to go when you’re still in contract. Full retail iPhones start around $650, and an ETF, at most, is $350. Add that to the iPhone’s $199 carrier pricing and you’re still saving $100.
* Perhaps even more intriguing is that 71% of the contract-breakers were previous iPhone owners, demonstrating once again how loyal Apple customers can be.
* How did you get your iPhone 4S? Did you break contract? Pay full price?
