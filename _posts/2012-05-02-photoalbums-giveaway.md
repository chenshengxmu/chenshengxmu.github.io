* We’ve talked about PhotoAlbums+ a couple of times here on iDB over the past two years. The tweak adds a host of features to the stock Photos app like the ability to create password-protected albums on the fly.
* Well the developers just released a major update to PhotoAlbums+, adding new PhotoStream controls to the package. And even better, they’ve given us 10 free copies to giveaway to our awesome readers! Read on…
* New features include:
* Of course, the update also features a number of significant bug fixes. But the real story here is the new PhotoStream features. The ability to block automatic uploads, and manually add photos to the cloud-based service is a pretty big deal.
* Now, onto the giveaway! To enter for a chance to win a free copy of PhotoAlbums+ (for the iPhone or iPad), all you have to do is complete these two easy steps.
* We will be notifying the winners on Friday afternoon via Twitter DM, so make sure you hurry up and enter!
