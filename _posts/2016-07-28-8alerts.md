* iOS 9 made some UI refinements over iOS 8, despite the fact that most of the UI looks primarily the same as before. One of the things Apple tweaked were the alerts that can pop up on your screen from notifications.
* In iOS 9, Apple changed the design a little bit and made the corners much rounder, and if you aren’t a fan of the change, then a new jailbreak tweak called 8Alerts may tickle your fancy.
* If you preferred the iOS 8-style notification alerts with their pointier corners, then you can install 8Alerts and get that look and feel back on your device right now.
* After you install the tweak, it’ll automatically change your alert-style notifications to look more like those in iOS 8. You don’t need to configure anything.
* Some prefer the pointier corners over the rounder ones, but it honestly comes down to personal preference. In some terms of UI, the rounder corners look more progressive than the pointier ones.
* Although the example above shows the About menu in the Cydia app, you will also notice this tweak affects alert notifications, such as those that you might get from Calendar alerts or Reminder alerts. Any app that you have alert-style notifications set for will be impacted by this tweak.
* I personally think that this tweak does a great job making the alerts look like they did in iOS 8, and it’s very hard to tell any difference between these and a legitimate iOS 8 device.
* The effects of 8Alerts are purely cosmetic and they aren’t going to affect the usability of your alert notifications whatsoever. If this is something you would like to add to your newly-jailbroken iOS device you can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for free right now.
