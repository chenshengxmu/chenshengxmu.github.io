* It’s been a busy weekend for jailbreak tool updates. Last night, the evad3rs released a new version of the evasi0n untether package in Cydia, and shortly after that they posted evasi0n 1.5.
* Windows users on older iOS devices might be happy to know that iH8sn0w has updated his Sn0wbreeze jailbreak tool as well. It now supports iOS 6.1.2, and features a handful of bug fixes…
* Sn0wbreeze actually saw two updates this weekend. Version 2.9.10 was released first, with support for iOS 6.1.2 and a fix for the Apple TV. And then came 2.9.11 with a Cydia-related bug fix.
* Additionally, iH8sn0w has updated his SHSH tool iFaith to version 1.5.3.  The app now supports blob dumping for 6.1.2 (on 3GS+A4 devices) and new improvements should make it run more smoothly.
* As usual, you can find both Sn0wbreeze and iFaith on our Downloads page. And if you need help using them, we have easy to follow, step-by-step video tutorials for them here and here.
