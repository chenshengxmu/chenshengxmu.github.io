* Christmas may be over now, but that doesn’t mean you have to be done getting presents. Apple has kicked off its ’12 Days of Gifts’ event this morning with a free gift for its faithful users, and will continue to give one each day for the next week and a half.
* Today’s gift is the iTunes Festival EP from music superstar Justin Timberlake. The album contains 4 live performances from Apple’s annual music festival this year, and is free for all users in qualifying areas who have downloaded the 12 Days of Gifts app…

* Timberlake’s EP includes performances of 4 hit songs: SexyBack, Take Back the Night, True Blood and TKO, and will only be available for 24 hours. After that, Apple will remove it and post a new song, app, book or movie every day through January 6, 2014.
* Folks in European countries have become accustomed to Apple’s yearly gift-giving ritual, but it’s never been available to those of us here in the United Sates until now. If you want to check it out, you can find the 12 Days of Gifts app in the App Store for free.
