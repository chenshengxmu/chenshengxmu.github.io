* As promised, Semaphore has released a rewrite of his popular TinyUmbrella tool for OS X and Windows. The tool, which has been completely rewritten from the ground up, is currently in beta and requires Java.
* Semaphore has alluded to the fact that the new TinyUmbrella may have far-reaching consequences related to downgrading both 32-bit and 64-bit devices. Back in the original TinyUmbrella’s heyday, it was used as a tool to help downgrade to prior versions of iOS.
* @JeffBenjam very much so.

* Apple eventually caught up with the tools used for downgrading, and the SHSH blob—the files used to facilitate such an action—became virtually useless with the then existing downgrade methods.
* But something has apparently changed. Semaphore appears bullish about the future of TinyUmbrella, SHSH blobs, and downgrading in general.
* The new tool has been simplified significantly, and now contains a single button dedicated to saving your SHSH blobs. As you can see from the screenshot below, I have several blobs saved for both iOS 8.2 and iOS 8.1.3 for my iPhone 6 Plus:
