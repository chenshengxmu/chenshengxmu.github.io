* Microsoft on Tuesday started airing a new Windows Phone commercial that takes another jab at Apple’s Siri. The 30-second commercial titled ‘Mirror, Mirror’ has been posted on the official Windows Phone channel on YouTube this morning.
* The video depicts Cortana, Microsoft’s personal digital assistant for Windows Phone devices, performing a series of tasks that Siri on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad can’t do, starting with deeper integration with core Windows Phone apps like calendar and Maps.
* One scene depicts Cortana tapping information stored in a user’s calendar to provide accurate route and mapping information. Another scene highlights dual front-facing speakers on the HTC One M8, to which Siri responds that she has but a single speaker and that she’s “sitting on it”.
* Here, check it out.

* Featuring a sleek, brushed aluminum body, a five-inch 1080p HD screen, a long-lasting battery and Windows Phone with Cortana, the HTC One M8 is one of the best Windows handsets available.
* Cortana is exclusive to Windows Phone 8.1 devices, though Microsoft remarked recently that it might bring the feature to other mobile platforms, including Apple’s OS.
* Back in July, the software giant released a Cortana ad which also features Siri. It depicts Microsoft’s assistant completing a number of contextually-aware tasks using a plethora of services and data sources.
* What do you think of today’s ad?
