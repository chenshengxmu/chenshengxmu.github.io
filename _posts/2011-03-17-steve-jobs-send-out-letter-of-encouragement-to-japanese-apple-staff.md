* In an email that was reportedly sent out to all Apple employees, Steve Jobs and the rest of the Apple executive team took some time out from their day-to-day activities to acknowledge the pain and suffering in Japan due to the earthquake and tsunami disasters.
* According to the email, Apple will supply the needed resources and supplies at employee request, and will arrange delivery; though obviously in the area’s current state, logistics could prove to be an issue.
* Apple has also delayed the iPad 2’s Japanese launch in light of the recent events. To read the entire email from Steve and the rest of the executive team, take a look inside…
* To Our Team in Japan,
* We have all been following the unfolding disaster in Japan. Our hearts go out to you and your families, as well as all of your countrymen who have been touched by this tragedy.
* If you need time or resources to visit or care for your families, please see HR and we will help you. If you are aware of any supplies that are needed, please also tell HR and we will do what we can to arrange delivery.
* Again, our hearts go out to you during this unimaginable crisis.
* Please stay safe.
* Steve and the entire Executive Team
* Jobs has personally visited Japan a number of times, and has been documented to be extremely fond of the country and a few of its tech companies. In fact, the majority of Jobs’ early motivation and focus on design has been credited to Sony.
