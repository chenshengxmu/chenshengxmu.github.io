* Take that Consumer Reports! The iPhone might not have been good enough for you, but it seems to be for JD Power who rated Apple and the iPhone #1 in their 2010 smartphone customer satisfaction study.
* For the fourth consecutive year, Apple ranks highest in customer satisfaction among smartphone makers with a score of 800 out of 1,000 points. The iPhone performs particularly well in ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design…
* Motorola (791 points) and HTC (781 points) follow Apple in the rankings. Damn, I didn’t even know Motorola made smartphones!
* What did prevent the iPhone from getting a perfect score? Its battery of course. Results are not surprising to me. iPhone kicks ass!
