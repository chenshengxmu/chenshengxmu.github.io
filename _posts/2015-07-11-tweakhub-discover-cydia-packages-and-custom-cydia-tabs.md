* TweakHub is one of the most impressive Cydia-centric tweaks that I’ve seen since Cydia opened up to accept substrate modifications. It allows you to find new packages based on the apps that you have installed on your device. It also allows you to rearrange the available Cydia tabs via an Edit option similar to the older versions of the Music app.
* If you’re looking for a new tweak to show off the power that Cydia now possess, then look no further. TweakHub can be found on a special third-party repo, and the details are in this post.

* First of all, the important stuff. If you want to download TweakHub and try it for yourself, then simply add the following repo to your list of Cydia sources:
* http://beta.unlimapps.com
* You can also click this link directly from your jailbroken iPhone or iPad to be taken directly to the package on Cydia without adding the repo.
* Keep in mind that you’ll need to be running Cydia 1.1.19 or higher in order to benefit from this tweak.
* Once TweakHub is installed, you’ll notice a new More tab in the bottom right-hand corner of Cydia. This More tab actually supplants the Search tab, but as you’ll see, you can still find the Search option from within the More tab.
* In the upper right-hand corner of the More tab is a Edit button. This Edit button, as mentioned, invokes an interface similar to what we’ve seen before in the iTunes and Music app. This allows you to replace and rearrange all of the tabs found at the bottom of Cydia. You completely customize the order of the tabs as well, as you can see from the image below.

* Along with Search, you’ll also find a TweakHub section, which is the main part of the release. The TweakHub section will list all of the apps that you have installed on your phone, and lets you see all of the tweaks that are designed for each particular app.
* For example, under the Safari section you’ll find Safari Downloader+, and under the Twitter section, you’ll find Twitter++. TweakHub is a great way to discover all of the tweaks that work with the apps, both stock and third-party, that you have installed on your device.
* Never before has it been truly easy to find tweaks directly from Cydia without having to look at outside sources. Sure, the Cydia front page lists a few apps and tweaks, but it’s not nearly as comprehensive as this. With TweakHub installed, discovery is a real part of the Cydia experience.
* What do you think about TweakHub? Are you excited about all of the awesome new Cydia tweaks that are slowly becoming available?
