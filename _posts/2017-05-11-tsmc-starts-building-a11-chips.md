* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has commenced production of Apple-designed A11 chips for upcoming iPhones and iPads.
* According to a report Thursday from Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, the semiconductor foundry has successfully resolved initial manufacturing issues in the company’s ten-nanometer FinFET process technology.
* “TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 series,” sources told the publication. “Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved.”
* TSMC is Apple’s exclusive manufacturer of the in-house designed 16-nanometer A10 Fusion chip for the iPhone 7 series. TSMC’s new ten-nanometer process should yield smaller chips that run faster and consume less energy.
* TSMC has also secured 12-nanometer chip orders (a smaller version of its 16nm technology) from Nvidia, MediaTek, Silicon Motion Technology and HiSilicon. As for TSMC’s 10nm process, the node technology has obtained orders from Apple, MediaTek and HiSilicon, as per sources.
