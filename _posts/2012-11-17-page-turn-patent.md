title: Digital page turn? Patented!

* If asked to single out a feature of iBooks that provokes most oohs and aahs, I’m sure you’d more or less unanimously opt for the page-turning effect. It didn’t take long before other e-book apps and devices began mimicking Apple’s animated skeuomorphism in iBooks.
* The page-turning trick in various implementations has become a standard feature of Amazon’s Kindle apps, Google Play Books software, Sony’s recently released iOS app, plus a host of other social news readers and e-reading programs. And just like that, Apple’s now been granted a patent for the feature, meaning the company basically owns the page turn…
* Earlier this week, the United States Patents and Trademarks Office published a document proving Apple was granted a patent for this feature.
* The patent D670,713 entitled “Display screen or portion thereof with animated graphical user interface” outlines methods for flipping pages of an electronic book via devices like iPads and iPhones.
* The ‘invention’ was highlighted yesterday by Nick Bilton of The New York Times.
* From the filing:
* The browsing device includes a controller that provides tactile feedback so as to lessen the user-interface differences between conventional books and e-books.
* Sensors and control mechanisms in the controller generate a series of electrical signals that are interpreted by the computer that displays the e-book to control various browsing operations, such as flipping pages, controlling a rate of page flipping, jumping to pre-set locations in the e-book, etc.
* Apple argues in the filing its page-turning solution differs from everything else out there in that it accurately renders how a physical page folds over when turned.
* Here’s one of the illustrations from the filing.

* The patent was filed in December 2011 and claims three inventors: Apple engineers Elizabeth Caroline Cranfill, Stephen Lemay and Mikio Inose.
* Apple is often criticized for holding patents for features like slide-to-unlock (and its variant), rubber-band scrolling and pinch zoom, to name a few. This, however, is taking the obvious to a whole new level.
* It’s not that the animation of the page turn isn’t a user interface metaphor per se – it is. But it’s impossible to deny that it’s also the exact replica of something humans have had in physical form for thousands of years.
* You’d be right to ask yourself how on Earth someone could gain a patent on such an obvious thing.
* Be that as it may, I’m sure someone will come up with a workaround to Apple’s patent.
* In fact, Apple’s patent is likely unenforceable.
* So, was Apple a tad over-zealous with this particular, ahem, ‘invention’?
* Does it prove that today’s patent system is broken beyond repair?
