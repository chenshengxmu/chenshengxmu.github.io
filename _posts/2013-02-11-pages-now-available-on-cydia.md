title: Pages+ now available on Cydia
---
* Prior to all the kerfuffle surrounding the iOS 6 jailbreak release, we previewed a jailbreak tweak called Pages+. This tweak allows you to enable custom wallpaper backgrounds for each page on your Home screen, and it even works with Aaron Ash’s popular Barrel tweak.
* Needless to say, we were pretty excited to preview Pages+, and we’re happy to report that it’s now available for download on Cydia. If you want to take it for a spin both figuratively, and literally, then head over to Cydia and download it today. Pages+ can be had for $1.99 via the ModMyi repo. Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments section.
