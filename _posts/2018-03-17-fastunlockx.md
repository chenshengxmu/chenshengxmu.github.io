title: FastUnlockX makes unlocking your iPhone X with Face ID even faster

* Anyone sporting an iPhone X should be familiar with how Face ID works by now. After the handset recognizes your face, you’re required to swipe up from the bottom of the display to get to your Home screen. But wouldn’t it be nice if you could skip the second step altogether?
* A new free jailbreak tweak dubbed FastUnlockX by iOS developer CPDigitalDarkroom brings this idea to fruition and makes unlocking your iPhone X with Face ID a split second faster.  
* After installing FastUnlockX on your jailbroken iPhone X, your device will begin taking you to your Home screen automatically once it distinguishes a recognized face. In other words, you won’t have to swipe up from the bottom of the display to get to your Home screen anymore.
* Notably, Apple imposes this two-step process to prevent accidental handset unlocks and hence slightly increase the user’s security. FastUnlockX defeats the purpose of this two-step process, but the trade-off is being able to access your Home screen more quickly.
* It’d be laughable to say that FastUnlockX saves time given just how fast the unlock process is on the iPhone X. You probably won’t save much time in the long run, but the tweak certainly adds to the convenience factor and makes accessing your device throughout the day slightly less cumbersome.
* FastUnlockX isn’t for everyone, especially those that have come to love the two-step unlock process. On the other hand, a tweak of this nature has been in high demand since iOS 11 first became jailbreakable, and it’s neat that there’s an official solution available in Cydia now.
* FastUnlockX works with all jailbroken iPhone X handsets and can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. For anyone interested in learning how the tweak works, CPDigitalDarkroom published FastUnlockX’s source code on GitHub.
