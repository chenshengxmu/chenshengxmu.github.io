* One of the most significant pain points involving the iOS user interface is the stock volume HUD. It pops up directly in the middle of your display, forcing you to wait for its automatic dismissal before returning to your tasks.
* Apple provided meaningful volume HUD-centric upgrades in iOS 11, but you’ll only notice them when you watch videos or play full-screen games. Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called VideoHUD by iOS developer Youssef Mikhail lets you enjoy these upgrades from anywhere in iOS.
* As you may have discerned already, VideoHUD lets you take advantage of iOS 11’s video player volume HUD on a system-wide basis. That said, you don’t need to be watching a video or playing a full-screen game to enjoy the perks of Apple’s upgraded volume HUD.
* Interested in what it looks like when used? Look no further than the animated GIF below:

* The benefits of the video player volume HUD include having an unobtrusive user interface that appears in the top right of your display rather than smack in the middle. Furthermore, it looks so much better, producing a more modern look and feel than the one we’ve seen throughout countless generations of iOS.
* In case it wasn’t blatantly obvious from the start, VideoHUD plays nicely with various types of volume adjustments. These include, but aren’t limited to, changes to media volume and ringer volume.
* VideoHUD is a relatively-straightforward jailbreak tweak with one purpose in mind, so it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that there aren’t any options to configure.
* The tweak provides a significant upgrade to jailbroken iOS 11 devices and can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Notably, because VideoHUD relies on the video player volume HUD that’s only available in iOS 11, the tweak will not work on jailbroken devices running iOS 10 or earlier.
* Which volume HUD do you prefer? Let us know in the comments section below.
