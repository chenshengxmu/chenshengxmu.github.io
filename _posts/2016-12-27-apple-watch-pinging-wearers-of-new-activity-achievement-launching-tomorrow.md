* Apple recently challenged Apple Watch wearers in the United States to bag a special Thanksgiving Day fitness achievement and now it’s doing the same with a brand new achievement launching tomorrow in the Activity app. As MacRumors notes, the notification is currently being pushed to Apple Watch owners.

* It informs users of a new achievement, aptly titled Ring in The New Year, that challenges them to close all three Activity rings each day for an entire week in January in order to earn the new virtual medal.
* Completing the challenge unlocks special stickers in Messages.
* The new Activity achievement should become visible in the Activity app on Apple Watch and iPhone at midnight local time on December 28.

* Unlike the Thanksgiving challenge, this one does not appear to be limited to U.S. users.
* Will you take Apple’s latest fitness challenge?
