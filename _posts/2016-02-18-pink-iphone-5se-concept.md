* The rumor-mill cannot agree whether a rumored ‘iPhone 5se’ is going to feature a refined iPhone 5s design or an iPhone 6-style look with smoothly rounded corners and curved screen edges.
* Be that as it may, German magazine Curved.de has taken upon itself to envision what the iPhone 5se might look like should Apple streamline its handset lineup around the current iPhone 6/6s look and feel.
* As a bonus, they’ve also done some intriguing renditions of what a next-generation ‘iPhone 7’ and a dual-camera ‘iPhone 7 Plus’ might look like, based on the rumors that have been floating around. Check out the images and tell us what you think in the comments.
* The images depict an artist’s rendition of a pink iPhone 5se imagined next to an iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the latter two conceptualized upon what we think we know so far about these devices.
* As a quick backgrounder, the iPhone 7 should ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a second speaker and have adjusted antenna bands and a back camera flush with the body.
* The iPhone 7 Plus, as per some sources,  should have dual cameras on the back.

* For good measure, here is their concept video as well.
* I’m not sure that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 5se will resemble these renders—they most likely won’t—but the images give us some food for thought. Additional renderings follow below.

* About two-dozen total images are available at the source link so visit Curved.de to see them all and then come back here and join us in comments.
* According to the rumor-mill, Apple will hold a media event next month that will serve as a launchpad for a new four-inch iPhone and a third-generation iPad Air. Tentatively dubbed ‘iPhone 5se,’ the phone is expected to utilize a revised iPhone 5s design, but include the latest hardware features such as Apple Pay, Touch ID, better cameras and Apple’s speedy A9 processor, among other features.
