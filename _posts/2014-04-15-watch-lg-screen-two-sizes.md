* Earlier this week KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a note to clients that Apple’s rumored wearable device – which was dubbed by the press the iWatch – should come in two sizes, featuring wireless charging and “fashionable” design.
* Corroborating the analyst report, a new story has it that the device is indeed coming later this year in two sizes, outfitted with a flexible screen made by LG Display, a company thought to be the sole display supplier for the device…
* A report from Korean publication Naver [Google translate] passed along by GforGames reiterates that Apple has reportedly struck a deal with LG Display to produce flexible displays for the iWatch.
* The device should come in two sizes: one with a 1.3-inch screen and the other incorporating a display measuring 1.5 inches diagonally. The smaller would be for women and the larger for men, as per previous reports.
* It should come out in September and Apple’s target is to sell nine million units this year.
* The report jives nicely with a January story by The Digital Daily asserting that LG Display was slated to start mass producing iWatch screens this Fall, with the initial production volume pegged at two million OLED screens per month.

* We also know Apple hired LG Display’s OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screen expert and that the firm has several patents involving flexible OLEDs, OLED based BLUs for LCDs, OLED control schemes and more.
* However, I find it rather odd that LG Display would be the sole supplier of iWatch screens. Apple typically sources components from multiple providers in order to mitigate risk by reducing its exposure to a single supplier.
* Also, the claim contradicts The Korea Herald report from last October saying Apple was considering adding Taiwan’s RiTDisplay and Japan Display to its supply chain for the iWatch.

* Latest rumors point to the iWatch being more of a fitness/health tracking device than a smartwatch. It’s said to include biometric sensors to track users’ health status, heart rates, blood chemistry and more and pair with iOS devices running iOS 8 and its rumored iWatch companion app called Healthbook, pictured above.
* The iWatch launch should be a pretty big deal, warranting its own media event. Therefore, we’re not expecting the official announcement at Apple’s upcoming summer developer conference, which kicks off June 2 in San Francisco.
* Is the iWatch going to happen?
