* Tech reviewer Michael Kukielka aka DetroidBORG recently published a quick preview of what the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are probably going to look like when they’re announced this Wednesday. The video on his YouTube channel actually compares high-quality iPhone 7 dummies that are mostly based on rumor-mill reporting. Now, I know we’ve posted our fair share of these mockups in past months.
* But with Apple’s big reveal almost upon us, I thought you guys might want to take another look at the iPhone 7’s design before the shiny new devices are unveiled.
* Again, these are just mockups that are widely available online as design case studies for case and accessory manufacturers and the like. Check out his video that I embedded right below.
* Are you disappointed that the next iPhone appears to be nearly identical to the iPhone 6s in terms of exterior design? I am not, because it should have significant hardware improvements and, you know, those two brand new Darth Vader-like colorways.
* Let us know what you think down in the comments.
