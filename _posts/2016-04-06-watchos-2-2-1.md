* Apple today seeded the first beta of watch OS 2.2.1 to the members of its Apple Developer Program. The pre-release software can be installed on an Apple Watch through the My Watch → General → Software Update section within the companion Watch app running on an iPhone with the new iOS 9.3.2 beta, which was also seeded to developers this morning.
* The software came with a build number of 13V413 and arrived approximately two weeks following the public release of the watchOS 2.2 firmware, a minor update for the Apple Watch that brought out an improved Maps app, support for multi-watch pairing and other tidbits.
* The new watchOS SDK 2.2.1 is also available with a complete set of Xcode tools, compilers and frameworks for creating native apps for watchOS. Release notes accompanying the download only mention bug fixes and general improvements.
* We’re combing through the release notes and user reports to discover if any new features have been added to watchOS 2.2.1 and we’ll update the article accordingly.
