* Google updated its iOS YouTube client this morning, bringing the universal app to version 2.16.11441. The update is fairly minimal, but it does include a new music homepage and YouTube Mix integration, making the music listening experience on YouTube “better than ever.”
* The new music homepage allows you to do things like play albums right from search, and it will now offer you song recommendations based on your previous listening habits. It also allows you to listen to an endless YouTube Mix playlist, built using your favorite songs and artists.
* For those who aren’t familiar with it, YouTube Mix is the website’s auto-generated playlist feature. Once you click on a video, YouTube will automatically compile a playlist of 50+ videos based on the clip you’re watching. It works similar to Pandora and other Internet radio services.
* YouTube certainly seems to be looking to play a bigger role in music, announcing a new streaming service yesterday called YouTube Music Key. That’s launching in beta next week for $7.99/month, but you can get the latest version of the YouTube app now in the App Store for free.
