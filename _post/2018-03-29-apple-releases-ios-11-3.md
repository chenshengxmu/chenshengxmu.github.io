* Less than a day following the release of iOS 11.3 solely for the new iPad, Apple on Thursday released the software update for other compatible iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices.
* You can grab the software from iDownloadBlog’s Download page.
* To deploy the latest software update over the air, go to Settings → General → Software Update, then follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the update.
* For the full list of fixes and new features in iOS 11.3, check out the official release notes.
* As evidenced earlier this morning by the leaked release notes, the Messages in iCloud feature and AirPlay 2 have not made the cut and will likely be part of iOS 11.4.
* iOS 11.3 lets you check out your battery health and assess its performance capacity. A switch in Settings → Battery lets you optionally disable Apple’s performance management features (CPU throttling) at the risk of unexpected shutdowns.

* Other changes, enhancements and feature improvements in OS 11.3 include four new Animoji characters, expanded health record integration, the ARKit 1.5 framework which can now detect walls and 2D images, software-based authentication for HomeKit so that older accessories can gain HomeKit compatibility via software updates, new sorting options for App Store, Business Chat via iMessage and much more.
* For detailed information on the security content of iOS 11.3, read Apple’s support document.
