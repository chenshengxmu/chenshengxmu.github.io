* Grab the Apple Store app at no charge from the App Store.
* “Apple Store app supports iOS 10 rich notifications for many activities,“ read release notes accompanying the 70.9-megabyte download. Aside from the two new features, the app also contains various improvements and performance enhancements.
* As mentioned, Apple Store for Apple Watch was also updated to support making one-tap purchases from the Favorites section, which now appears on your wrist in addition to the iOS app and Apple.com like before.
* Purchasing from Favorites is limited to accessories, for now.
