* One of the more under the radar features of macOS is the ability to auto-hide the menu bar. Just like the Dock, which has long had the ability to auto-hide, the menu bar can be hidden until needed.
* Auto-hiding the menu bar brings the obvious benefit of having more on screen real estate and less distraction. With both the Dock and menu bar set to auto-hide, you can experience a shockingly clean interface as you go about your work.
* Step 1: Open System Preferences.
* Step 2: Click General.
* Step 3: Check the Automatically hide and show the menu bar option
* The menu bar will immediately hide from view.
* To view the menu bar, simply drag your cursor up to the top of the screen and hold it there for a second. Just like the Dock when hidden, the menu bar should reveal itself automatically when the cursor is near.
* When I first learned about menu bar hiding, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. But after enabling menu bar hiding along with Dock hiding, I have to say that I’m a big believer.
* It makes me wonder why Apple took so long to implement such a great feature. The clean feeling you get from this has to be experienced to appreciate it. It’s not going to change your life or anything, but it does provide you with a sudden sense of freedom, especially on a large display.
* What do you think about menu bar hiding? Are you a fan?
