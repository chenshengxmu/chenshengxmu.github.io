* With just a few days left until the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off in Las Vegas, Corning, a Kentucky-based glass-maker, has announced the third iteration of its popular Gorilla Glass line.
* As most of you know, Gorilla Glass is a high-strength, thin sheet of glass used as a protective cover in many touch screen devices, including Apple products. And version 3 is a lot more durable…
* Corning (via Engadget) says that Gorilla Glass 3 has been improved at the molecular level, incorporating a new proprietary feature called Native Damage Resistance, for a new level of toughness.
* According to the company, NDR reduces the appearance of scratches (40% better than GG2), and does a better job of maintaining the overall retained strength of the glass (50% better than GG2).
* Additionally, Corning also plans to unveil another new product: fiber-based, device-to-device Optical Cables that significantly extend the data transmission range past the limits of copper-based cables.
* Corning plans to reveal all of the juicy details on both of its new products during a January 7 announcement, and of course will be on-hand demonstrating its new tech at its CES booth all next week.
* I don’t know about you folks, but any product that touts a 50% improvement over its predecessor is pretty impressive. I’ll take all of my late-2013, 2014 devices wrapped in Gorilla Glass 3, thank you.
