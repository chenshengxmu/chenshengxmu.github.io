* A new report from the fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara has put an end to persisting iPhone 7 Pro rumors, saying Apple will stick to its regular handset naming convention and market the upcoming phones under the expected iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus monikers.
* The report cites a “reliable information source” that previously provided accurate information regarding the iPhone 5c and was first to call for the iPhone SE name.
* The report adds that the new phones feature a capacitive, non-moving Home button with Force Touch haptic feedback. Assuming the source is right, we can expect the usual 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone models in September, without a third ‘iPhone 7 Pro’ tier.
* Japanese outlet Nikkei previously said that Apple did engineer a third Pro model with a dual-lens camera while the regular Plus model has a single-lens shooter. However, Nikkei claims Apple decided to ditch the Pro amid increased competition in the smartphone space and put the dual-lens camera inside the iPhone 7 Plus, which should also feature 3 GB of RAM.
