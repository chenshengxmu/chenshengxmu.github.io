* Adding to the array of iPad 3 rumors that have been floating our way, 9to5mac’s Mark Gurman has published a report clearing the waters about recent talk over which processor Apple is going to use in the iPad 3.
* There have been conflicting reports that the iPad 3 will feature a quad-core processor, while some say it will only be an upgraded dual-core. We’ve seen code references and pictures of both, but today, 9to5mac says that Apple has been working on both the A5X and A6 processors…
* In their report, 9to5mac shows iOS 5.1 beta code that references both processors. The A5X processor is referenced as S5L8945X and the A6 processor is referenced as S5L8950X.

* The report also provides some speculation about where we might see each processor placed. One possible explanation for Apple manufacturing two processors is that the quad-core A6 processor may be found in the iPad 3, while the A5X may be found in the rumored Apple TV that’s set to launch in March. Or perhaps, Apple just simply developed each processor to see which would better fit the iPad 3.
* While there’s still conflicting reports on the processor the iPad 3 will have, publications are agreeing that the iPad 3 will feature a Retina display, upgraded cameras, LTE, the possibility of Siri support, and larger battery. Many reports have said that the iPad 3 will be announced in the first week of March and shipping soon after.
* More possibilities of where each processor could be placed include the A6 processor being found in the iPad 3 with the A5X in a less powerful iPad, or that Apple could be saving the A5X for the 8-inch iPad we’ve been hearing about.
* The most likely scenario in our eyes is the A6 processor in the iPad 3, and the A5X processor in the Apple TV. However, time will only tell.
* Are you tired of the iPad 3 rumors, or are they getting you pretty excited?
