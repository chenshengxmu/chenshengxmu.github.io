* This week started out pretty slow, but once the end of the week came around, things started to heat up for the jailbreak community pretty quickly.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the new jailbreak tweak releases that became available in Cydia this week, starting with our favorites and moving on to the rest afterwards.
* Flex 3 – $4.00 (free limited trial)

* Flex 3 is an incredible platform that lets jailbreakers create their own patches for the system or for installed apps, and it’s even better than its predecessors.
* Built completely from Swift 3, Flex 3 is now faster and easier for the developer to maintain.
* Moreover, a cloud-based system lets users mingle with one another by sharing their patches with the rest of the Flex 3 community. Users can also take advantage of commenting, up-voting, and down-voting packages based on whether or not they work as advertised.
* Flex 3 is available as a free download for a limited trial version that offers access to only some of the platform’s free patches, but by paying the $4.00 price tag, you will unlock full access to everything it has to offer. You can read our full post about Flex 3 to learn more about it.
* FlixEnhancer – $1.99

* FlixEnhancer takes the popular Netflix video streaming app to the next level with a number of new features.
* With this tweak, users can utilize a better media rating system, as well as a better way to skip through video to a future point, and even take advantage of improvements to sound quality when using Chromecast devices.
* FlixEnhancer works with the latest version (9.0.3) of the Netflix app, so it’s packaged up with a nice red bow and ready to go.

* Scriblit is a really cool new jailbreak tweak that lets you draw and annotate on your device’s screen.
* It comes with a variety of options, such as color choices, pen size, and alpha level to make sure to get the best annotation effect you can get. You can also use the built-in tools to save screenshots of your scribbles and share them with others.
* You can use it for a variety of things, whether you want to show someone how to do something, or you just want to scribble on a photo for laughs.
