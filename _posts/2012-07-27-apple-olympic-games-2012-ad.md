title: Apple airs new adverts about Geniuses
---
* Apple has begun airing interesting new commercials, possibly marking a subtle change in advertising direction. The adverts debuted during the Olympic Games opening ceremonies tonight. Rather than focus on the newly released Mountain Lion, the nine-month-old iPhone 4S or Siri (which is increasingly working against Apple these days), these new clips depicts Apple Store Geniuses solving problems for customers.
* The first advert that can be seen above is aptly named Mayday and depicts a Genius on board an airplane helping a customer solve an issue before landing. Two more commercials are included right below for your viewing pleasure…
* Hat tip to iClarified for first spotting these little gems.
* The second advert titled Basically is also focused on Mac software. Here we have a Genius explaining to a customer what separates a Mac from an ordinary computer, like built-in apps.
* The third one is called Labor Day tells a story of a Genius showing a soon-to-be father some of the cool stuff he can make with iPhoto.
* The adverts are definitely quite different from what we’re accustomed to from Apple. Perhaps a change in creative direction has something to do with Apple’s hiring of Dixons former CEO John Browett as its new Senior Vice President of Retail?
* Anyways, how did you like these commercials?
* Let us know in the comments.
