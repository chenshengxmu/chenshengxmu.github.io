* The third-generation iPad, announced by Apple last week, is set to arrive at customer’s doors Friday and go on-sale in stores that morning at 8am. However, a few people in Hong Kong have gotten an early look at Apple’s new 10-inch creation and have unboxed the tablet for all of us to see. We also saw a few pictures taken with the camera earlier this morning.
* This afternoon, Chinese publication PCM Online, has gotten its hands on the new iPad. The publication was able to unbox a 16GB white model, featuring 4G…
* The video, as seen below, guides us through what comes with the box and an overall look at the device. We also get to see the third-generation iPad compared closely to the iPad 2.
* PCM Online also took a look at the camera quality between the new iPad and iPad 2. As you can see, the new iPad’s camera takes much better pictures; it features an upgraded 5-megapixel camera. While the iPad’s camera isn’t 8-megapixel like the iPhone 4S‘, it still looks pretty good.
