* Google’s recently redesigned native Calendar app for iPhone and iPad was updated yesterday with support for iOS 11, iPhone X’s edge-to-edge OLED screen and iPad drag and drop.
* Google Calendar 2.22 for iPhone and iPad now includes official iOS 11 and iPhone X support, according to release notes accompanying the download. And with drag and drop support, you can drag content from other apps into Calendar, and vice versa.
* For instance, you can drag a document from another G Suite app, like Google Docs, into the attachment field of an event. Another example: you can drag some text from a webpage in Safari into the description of an event in the Calendar app.

* A recent Calendar update added support for drag and drop event, reminder and goal rescheduling directly from your Day, 3-Day and Week views. The app has a handy Today widget for those times when you’d like to glance at your day’s events from the Lock screen.
* The Goals feature, by the way, lets Calendar mark your fitness goals done automatically in Apple Health. Lastly, don’t forget that Calendar supports 3D Touch—you can press firmly on an event to quickly see the details without leaving the schedule view.
* Download Google Calendar for free from App Store.
