* Apple just posted the introduction videos for the iPad Air 2 and iMac with Retina 5K display shown during this morning’s event to its YouTube channel. So for folks who haven’t seen the keynote yet, or simply want to watch the clips again, here is your chance.
* The video for the iPad Air 2 is short, coming in at just over 30 seconds, and focuses on the tablet’s thinner profile by hiding it behind a laser-cut pencil. As for the new Retina display iMac, there are 2 videos that—as you’d expect—highlight its beautiful screen.
