* As first discovered by AppleInsider, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) this morning awarded Apple a patent for a snap-on gaming accessory for the iPhone which imagines physical button controls such as miniature joysticks, action buttons and directional D-pads positioned at left and right of the screen.
* The patent No. 8,939,838 titled “Accessory for playing games with a portable electronic device” even envisions added extras such as an additional multitouch display, cameras, microphones and speakers to elevate the experience.
* Designed to dock a portable device like an iPhone, in landscape mode, the accessory features a connector insert which rotates, allowing a docked device to rotate into the accessory’s recess for more comfortable gaming.

* Another embodiment envisions a Nintendo DS-like second screen which Apple describes as yet another mobile device, such as the iPhone or iPod touch.

* Supporting both local and online multiplayer gaming, Apple says that the first mobile device/accessory can communicate wirelessly over Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth with the second unit for head-to-head gaming.

* The accessory, as well as the first and second-screen mobile device, can also communicate wirelessly with home theater or audio systems, TVs and monitors (presumably over AirPlay, a media streaming technology from Apple).
* “Individual information can be displayed on portable electronic devices while shared information can be displayed on television, monitor or home theater,” explains Apple.

* Another implementation even calls for a built-in physical thumb keyboard replacing the iPhone’s software keyboard. The idea for a snap-on iPhone gaming accessory dates back to more than six years ago: Apple first filed an application for this patent back in 2008.
* As you know, Apple two years ago extended its ‘Made for iPhone’ (MFi) program to third-party controllers designed to dock an iPhone or iPod touch and provide precise controls via physical buttons and Apple’s APIs.
* However, the first batch of MFi controllers did not prove popular due to high price, less-than-stellar reviews and poor build quality.
* The patent credits Apple engineers Brett Gregory Alten and Sanjay Sadanand Gadkari as its inventors.
* As we reported recently, another patent filing indicated Apple’s interest in an iPhone phone button that pops up when pressed to transform into a thumb joystick for playing games.
