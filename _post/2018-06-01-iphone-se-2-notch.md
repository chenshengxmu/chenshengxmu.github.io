* The latest rumor about the so-called iPhone SE 2 suggests Apple’s next budget phone will include an iPhone X-like notch. If correct, it would mean Apple has finally decided on a final design for the 4-inch device after months of indecision.
* In a Friday tweet, serial Apple leaker Sonny Dickson posted an image purportedly showing an iPhone SE 2 screen protector. As you can see below, the protector appears to show placement for a notch like the one found on Apple’s flagship device. The notch houses the iPhone X’s facial recognition sensors.

* Just weeks ago, it looked like Apple was struggling to determine which final iPhone SE 2 design to use. At the time, Japanese blog Mac Otakara said at least one of those designs featured a notch while others were more in line with the current look, which is similar to the iPhone 5 series design.
* Whether the next iPhone SE will come with a headphone jack also remains open to debate. In April, there were at least two conflicting reports. One said the 4-inch device would feature an all-glass back and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Another report, also from Mac Otakara, said the iPhone SE 2 would come with an A10 Fusion chip, Touch ID, but no headphone jack.
* Next week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) might not feature new hardware. If this is the case, it could be months before we see the final iPhone SE 2 design revealed.
* Besides a new iPhone SE, Apple’s likely to reveal three other iPhones before the end of the year, including a second-generation iPhone X, 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus,” and 6.1-inch budget model. The first two are expected to feature OLED while the third should keep LCD like the displays found on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.
* As a reminder, the WWDC 2018 keynote address begins on Monday, June 4 at 10. a.m. PDT. During the event, we should see next-generation versions of iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and, of course, macOS.
* Which iPhone do you plan on purchasing this fall? Let us know below.
