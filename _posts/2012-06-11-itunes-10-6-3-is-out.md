* Apple has just released a new iTunes version 10.6.3 that features support for iOS 6 beta. It looks like a maintenance release aimed at only supporting the new capabilities provided by iOS 6.
* It’s a bit surprising that Apple decided to make iTunes 10.6.3 available to everyone as iOS 6 is in beta and normally one needs a paid developer account to download and install iOS betas…
* iTunes 10.6.3is required if you’re a developer and want to update your iOS devices to the latest iOS 6 beta that got released earlier this morning. Although the software supports only iOS 6 Beta, which won’t be released to end-users until fall, iTunes 10.6.3 is available for download to everyone.
* You can download the 170MB package via Apple’s iTunes page or by choosing Software Update… from your computer’s Mac menu.
* It was available via the download page at post time, but not yet through the Software Update mechanism so give it a little until changes propagate through Apple’s servers.
* Let us know down in the comments if you spot anything of interest in iTunes 10.6.3 beyond support for iOS 6 Beta.
