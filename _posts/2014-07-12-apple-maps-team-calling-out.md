* Continuing on with its efforts to refine its mapping software, Apple has apparently begun calling businesses looking to verify user-reported address corrections. In a recent Reddit post, a business owner said he had been contacted by someone with Apple Maps.
* Reddit user swb1192 said he received an interesting phone call from a 408 number (a Cupertino, California area code) this week. The person said that they were with Apple’s Maps team, and that a user had reported his business address as incorrect, which it was…
* Here’s the full Reddit post:
* A 408 number called me from Apple Maps and let me know that a user reported my business address as incorrect. They still had my old address that was listed on Yelp so I gave them the new one. I asked when I should expect it to be updated on Apple Maps and the lady said, “We don’t have an exact timeline for updates but it should be within the next week.”
* It appears that Apple pulled from Yelp awhile ago but it doesn’t actually sync the addresses and other information.
* Still couldn’t believe that they called me to fix up the listing – how awesome.
* Apple has really ramped up its efforts to correct Maps errors in recent months. In April, it was reported that the company was testing a push notification system to alert users when their issue had been fixed, and it’s believed it’s now posting daily updates at 3am EST.
* Maps has come a long way since Apple introduced it in 2012, as many of the early-criticized issues—incorrect/missing GPS data— have been fixed. The app is now available on both iOS and Mac, CarPlay, and is expected to make the leap to the rumored iWatch this fall.
