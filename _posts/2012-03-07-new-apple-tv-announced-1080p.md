* As expected, Tim Cook just announced a new Apple TV with a brand new UI and 1080p support in tow.
* The rumors have been swirling about the Apple TV refresh for some time now, and they ultimately proved to be true.
* With the new Apple TV comes 1080p support for iTunes in the Cloud, which means you can re-download all of your purchased content in 1080p for free.

* The device, apparently, will look externally similar to the existing product from what we can tell.
