* With Apple widely expected to unveil two new iPhones next week, folks have been wondering what’s going to happen to the current iPhone 5. Apple typically keeps previous models around to sell at a discount, but it may not have to with a lower-cost ‘5C’ in the lineup.
* In fact, some pundits believe that Apple is going to discontinue the iPhone 5 later this month. And today comes purported evidence of that theory, with a leaked carrier inventory screenshot showing multiple current-gen iPhones being discontinued on September 28…
* The image comes from MobileSyrup (via iPhone in Canada):

* Note that the bottom 4 lines in this spreadsheet show iPhone 5 32GB and 64GB models in red, marked as ‘To be discontinued.’ True, Apple typically drops higher capacity models of its previous iPhones when a new one arrives, but the fact that no white models, of any capacity, are listed kind of offsets that angle. Are there more models listed below the cutoff point in the screenshot?
* Today’s leaked screenshot comes three weeks after KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple would be phasing out the iPhone 5 this fall in favor of the 5C, which will sport similar features and a cheaper price tag. In a note to investors, the oft-accurate analyst wrote:
* “We’ve learned that the iPhone 5 line will be terminated from 4Q13, while the iPhone 4S line will carry on. From this, we infer that iPhone 5C is launched to replace iPhone 5. In other words, the 5C model will be positioned as midrange. We forecast its retail price to be US$400-500.”
* Kuo also said he believes Apple will keep the iPhone 4 and 4S around, which is weird considering that would mean it would have to continue supporting the older 3.5-inch display and 30-pin connector. You’d think that if anything, they’d want to move away from those devices.
* We’ll find out soon enough. Apple is expected to unveil both the iPhone 5S and 5C at a media event next Tuesday. And according to previous reports and part leaks, the 5C will feature a 4-inch display, similar specs to the iPhone 5, and sport a plastic shell in various bright colors.
* What do you think, will Apple discontinue the iPhone 5 this fall?
