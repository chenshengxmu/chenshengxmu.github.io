* If the name Jan-Michael Cart sounds familiar, it’s because you’ve likely seen his work here on iDB. The 20-something mass media arts student from Georgia has practically become an overnight sensation thanks to his popular concept videos.
* Cart has re-imagined several components of iOS such as application switching, notifications, and voice recognition. A lot of folks have commented that his work is good enough to earn him a spot at Apple. And, apparently, Apple agrees.
* Jan-Michael recently added a blog section to his personal website and posted this message:
* “Welcome to the new blog section of my website. Soon I will be embarking to California, where I will be interning at a fruit company for seven months. I will be updating this to chronicle my adventures and misadventures in the Bay Area for my family, friends, and followers online. Stay tuned, I leave in less than a month!”
* Of course, it’s no surprise that Apple picked up the talented designer. Just look at his concept video of what he calls “Dynamic Icons.”
* Even though it’s only an internship, Cart’s announcement is certainly exciting. iOS is going on 5 years without any major cosmetic changes, and Apple’s recent interests in people like Peter Hajas and Jan-Michael Cart could be a sign that it’s looking to give the OS a facelift.
