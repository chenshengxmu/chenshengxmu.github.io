title: Rumor- iPad 3 May Launch on Steve Jobs Birthday, February 24
---
* You’re going to have to take this one with a huge grain of salt as it comes straight from unreliable sources. According to Focus Taiwan, via 9to5Mac:
* A local Chinese-language newspaper reported Friday that iPad3 might be launched on Feb. 24 to mark the anniversary of the birth of Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs.
* While the rumor of the launch date itself doesn’t sound completely out of this world, the source is unknown and probably not worthy of trust.
