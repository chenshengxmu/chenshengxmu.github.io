* Earlier today Apple released iOS 4.3.2 for iPhone. Even though we gave a warning to jailbreakers and unlockers to stay away from iOS 4.3.2, it seems that there is good news on the jailbreak side.
* By using the latest version of RedSn0w, I was able to jailbreak my iPhone 3GS on 4.3.2. All it took was just about 2 minutes of my day…
* I basically ran RedSn0w and pointed it to iOS 4.3.1 instead of 4.3.2. A couple minutes later, my iPhone rebooted with Cydia installed. I’m a blank icon instead of the Cydia one for the moment but I guess it will only take the right files to edit to get it back.
* I can’t confirmed if it works for any other device. I just tried on my iPhone 3GS, and no, I’m not going to risk losing my soft unlock to try that on my iPhone 4. I was able to reboot my iPhone 3GS without any problem because it has an old bootrom. Newer models will probably be tethered.
* If you have an iPhone and don’t care about the unlock, give this a try and let us know how it goes.
* If you’re not sure how to use RedSn0w, follow our RedSn0w guide here. Everything is exactly the same except that you have to be on 4.3.2 to begin with. Any questions, feel free to ask.
