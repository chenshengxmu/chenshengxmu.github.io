* Those in the market for a new iPad Air or a first generation iPad mini may want to check with their local Best Buy this weekend. The retailer is hosting a 2-day sale that will see all models of the two tablets discounted up to $50.
* Running Friday and Saturday only, the sale covers all configurations of the iPad Air and original iPad mini. So for example, a 16GB Wi-Fi only Air would only cost you $450. The iPad mini, with its discount, will start at $279…
* CNET has the scoop on the promotion, which also includes a device trade-in offer:
* “Finally, Best Buy customers can score at least a $10 gift card by trading in virtually any electronic device, including digital cameras, digital camcorders, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, gaming consoles, and MP3 players. Certain tablets, phones, and gaming systems can qualify for at least a $75 gift card. The device does have to power up and be free of water damage and any cracks in the screen. This latest trade-in deal runs through February 1.”
* Additionally, Best Buy is taking $50 off the 16GB iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, and $100 off the 32GB iPhone 5c. This particular offer obviously depends on your carrier, and like all cell phone promos, requires a two-year agreement.
* Remember, the iPad sale ends Saturday night, but the trade-in and iPhone offers are running through the first of February. These aren’t the cheapest prices we’ve seen on these devices, but they’re fairly good deals post-holidays.
