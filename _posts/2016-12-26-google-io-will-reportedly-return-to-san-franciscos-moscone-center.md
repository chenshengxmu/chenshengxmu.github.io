* Google I/O, the search giant’s version of Apple’s WWDC, will return to the Moscone Center in San Francisco next year, TechCrunch has learnt. Google I/O 2016 was held at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View to mark the 10th anniversary of the company’s first developers conference at their headquarters. Google I/O 2017 should mark a return to the Moscone Center in San Francisco, where Apple has for years held its own annual developers conference.
* The three-day Google I/O 2016 event claimed more than 7,000 developer attendees in addition to Google engineers and product managers. The main keynote was available as a live 360-degree video stream. Google usually holds I/Os in May, but in the past some events were held as late as June.
* The biggest announcement that came from Google I/O 2016 included the new Daydream VR platform, Allo messaging app, Duo video-calling app, Echo-like Google Home connected speaker, Google Assistant, Android N, Android Wear 2.0 and more.
