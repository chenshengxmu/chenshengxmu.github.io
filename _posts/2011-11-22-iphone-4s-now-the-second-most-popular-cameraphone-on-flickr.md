* The iPhone 4S’ rebuilt 8MP camera is one of the new handset’s most talked about features. It captures sharper images with much better color in low-light situations than its predecessor, with 60% more pixels.
* Apple has even been touting the 4S as a point-and-shoot camera replacement, and it seems like iPhone 4S owners agree with that statement. The handset has just become the second most frequently used camera phone on Flickr…
* With over 50 million members and 6 billion hosted photos to date, Flickr’s image upload data is a great way to gage a camera’s popularity. The service knows which device a photo was taken with using the image’s EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) information.

* As you can tell from the graph, the iPhone 4S has passed up the 3G, 3GS, and the HTC Evo 4G to become the second most popular camera phone on the site. It sits only behind the iPhone 4, which became Flickr’s most popular camera overall earlier this year.
* Apple’s been criticized in the past for being behind the megapixel curve, releasing a phone with a 3.2MP camera when the competition had 5MP, and a 5MP when others had 8MP. But it hasn’t hurt the device’s popularity; the top 3 camera phones on Flickr are all iPhones.
