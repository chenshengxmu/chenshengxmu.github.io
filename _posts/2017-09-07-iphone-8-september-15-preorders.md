* The ultimate in tech bling, Appleâ€™s iPhone 8, is expected to be announced at the September 12 Steve Jobs Theater media event and now two German carriers claim that the company will be collecting pre-orders for the device beginning Friday, September 15.
* According to German blog Macerkopf.de (Google Translate) yesterday, sources with two mobile phone operators in Germany have said that pre-orders for the device may possibly start on September 15, three days following the official unveiling on Tuesday, September 12.
* One of the carriers is Deutsche Telekom and the other could be O2 or Vodafone.
* Actual sales are said to kick off a week later on Friday, September 22. The Cupertino company has ostensibly informed major wireless carriers to prepare inventory and marketing plans ahead of the September 12 unveiling, according to an earlier report.
