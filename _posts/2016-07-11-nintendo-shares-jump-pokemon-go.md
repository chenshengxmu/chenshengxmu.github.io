* Since releasing its augmented-reality game Pokémon GO five days ago on the App Store in the United States, New Zealand and Australia, Nintendo stock has jumped 25 percent, gaining a cool $7.5 billion and posting a record since it began trading in Tokyo in 1983, Reuters reported Monday.
* The freemium game uses real-world maps, the iPhone’s sensors and location to create an augmented reality experience set in the real world, challenging players to find and capture other Pokémon at various landmarks in their vicinity.
* Bloomberg adds that shares of Nintendo have climbed 34 percent in the past two days of trading after the game was released for the iPhone and Android devices.
* According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, the already controversial augmented-reality game will launch in Japan, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe and world “within a few days”.
* At the time of this writing, the game was the #1 Free App on the US App Store.
* Data from App Annie suggest that Pokémon GO is the most downloaded and highest-grossing app in the countries where it is available. Data firm SimilarWeb said today that the game is about to surpass Twitter among Android users in the United States as far as the number of daily active users.
* Pokémon developer Niantic told TechInsider that new features are coming, including trading characters and more ways to play with Pokéstops and Gyms.
