* My sister-in-law has finally come over to the Dark Side. That is, from my brother’s point of view, who is a diehard Android user. She recently invested in the new iPhone. Now, she has a shiney new phone, but doesn’t know a thing about what apps to get.
* So, being the app expert that I am, it is my job to help her find the perfect games, photo editors, and social networking enhancements to make her iOS experience the best it can be. This year, she’ll be getting apps for Christmas.
* If you are new to iOS, or have never thought about giving an app as a gift, you may not know how to do so. We have a quick tutorial to explain how to send an app to your friends and family through iTunes on your computer or through the App Store on your iOS device.
* Buying an app is as simple as clicking a few tabs and entering your Apple ID.
* Step 1: Go to iTunes on your desktop or laptop.
* Step 2: Find the app you want to gift.
* Step 3: Click the arrow for the dropdown menu right next to the “Buy” tab below the app’s icon.

* Step 4: Select “Gift This App.”
* Step 5: Enter the email address of the recipient. You can send an app to multiple recipients. You will be charged for each email address included as a recipient.
* Step 6: Include a personal message. This will be included in the email notification that is sent to the recipient.
* Step 7: Select the receive date. If this is going to be a Christmas present, send it on Christmas Eve so that it will arrive in their email inbox the next morning.
* Step 8: Click the “Next” Button.
* Step 9: Select the theme. The email that the recipient receives will have a festive design relating to the theme you pick. For example, the blue Holiday theme features a snowflake.
* Step 10: Click the Next Button.
* Step 11: Confirm your order and click the “Buy Gift” button. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID and password at this time.
* You can also gift an app to anyone right from your iPhone or iPad.
* Step 1: Open the App Store app.
* Step 2: Find the app you want to gift.
* Step 3: Tap the share icon in the upper right corner of the screen. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing upward.
* Step 4: Tap “Gift” from the pop-up window.
