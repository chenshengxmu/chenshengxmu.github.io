* It’s been a decade since musician David Bowie’s 2003 album, “Reality”. To promote his upcoming album entitled “The Next Day”, Bowie turned to Apple’s iTunes, the leading music store in the world which previously cut exclusive free streaming deals to promote new albums from the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ke$ha, One Direction, Matchbox 20 and Jack White.
* That’s right, iTunes is going to stream the upcoming David Bowie album in its entirety, free of charge, until its March 12 release. “The Next Day” can be pre-ordered for via iTunes right now, as either the $11.99 ‘normal’ release or the $13.99 Deluxe version which comes with three bonus tracks. By the way, the album is Mastered for iTunes…
* Thanks to pre-orders, “The Next Day” has risen to become the top album on iTunes charts in 34 countries.
* From iTunes:
* Rock pioneer David Bowie returns after a 10-year studio hiatus to record a fresh batch of obersvational songs. The Next Day finds Bowie moving easily between slow introspection and dancefloor rock outs.
* Recorded in complete secrecy over a two-year period with long-time producer and collaborator Tony Visconti, Bowie’s steady baritone weaves an eclectic array of tracks that illuminate the artist’s wealth of musical inspiration – everything from psychedelia to the Motown sound.
* The musician on his 66th birthday (January 8) released a video for the single entitled “Where Are We Now?”, here it is.
* A bit later in January, another music video for “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” single was released on David Bowie’s VEVO channel on YouTube.
* It was directed by Floria Sigismondi and stars Bowie and Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton.
* Billboard praised the album for its modern sound “well-connected to the artist’s fabled sonic-past.” By the way, Bowie announced on his Facebook page that this is a worldwide exclusive deal with iTunes.
