* Things are not happy and beautiful any longer for Samsung, the world’s number one smartphones manufacturer. As reported by Bloomberg, the Korean giant has posted its slowest growth since 2011.
* Who’s to blame for the slow growth pace? For one, there is Lenovo, Huawei and other makers of cheap smartphones who’ve been flooding the markets in many areas, especially in Asia, a strong ground for Samsung. Apple is also partly responsible from Samsung’s decline as the fruity company has been luring high-end customers away from the Galaxy line maker…
* The news will probably feel like a bucket of cold water thrown on the Korean company which has been riding high on its status of number one for a while. Sometimes, being number one doesn’t really matter if you can’t keep these profit margins high, and that’s exactly what Samsung is realizing right now.
* According to Bloomberg:
* Fourth-quarter operating income at Samsung’s mobile unit, the company’s biggest profit driver, was 5.47 trillion won, little changed from a year earlier and down from a record 6.7 trillion-won profit in the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company said.
* The company said it “planned to lower its mobile marketing spend this year relative to revenue, after big promotional spending hit fourth-quarter profit,” reports Reuters. Maybe it’s a not a bad thing?
* On the other side, Apple is expected to have shipped a record 55 million iPhones during last quarter. We’ll get confirmation next week as the company will report its Q1 financials.
