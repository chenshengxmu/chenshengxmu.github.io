* You must have heard rumors of Facebook poaching former and current Apple hardware and software engineers to work on its not-so-secret phone project. So, a Facebook phone.
* We’re still scratching our head over this rumored device. Why on Earth Facebook won’t Facebook focus on perfecting its subpar mobile apps rather than waste its energies cracking the hardware biz it literally knows nothing about?
* Regardless of the hearsay, here’s a really interesting mockup which depicts perfectly what a Facebook phone might look like…
* Designer Michal Bonikowski envisions a hypothetical device with a 4.2-inch display and an eight-megapixel camera on the back. As you can see, it looks quite stunning – someone should hire this guy.
* Here’s another image.

* Surely Tim Cook would want to add Facebook to Apple’s list of companies that rip off its designs should such a concept become a reality. And why build a phone – if there’s any substance to this rumor – in the first place?
* Well, how about the failed IPO and issues with monetizing users through social ads?
* As for me, I’m kinda loving this concept.
* It’s design should be distinct yet familiar enough to any Facebook user.
* It’s also thin, sleek and – dare I say – sexy.
* What do you guys think?
