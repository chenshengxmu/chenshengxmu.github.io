* Fans of the greatest baseball game of the late-1980s can finally get a chance to play the MLB’s modernized version of R.B.I. Baseball on the iPhone and iPad. Instead of trying to sell you on an overpriced port, or letting you download it for free only to hit you with a pay wall a few games later, MLB.com has revised the game for a new generation of baseball fans with a reasonable price tag and no in-app purchases.
* R.B.I. Baseball 14 has been “reimagined” with modern day graphics, touch screen controls, and an old-school aesthetic that will take you back to your childhood, but not bore your kid to tears wondering where the action is…
* The game maintains its classic feel, even though its been updated for 2014. Orioles center fielder Adam Jones was quoted on MLB.com as saying “It brings back the old ‘90s feeling of the game and it’s like playing Super Nintendo all over again.”

* If you are worried that this redesigned version will ruin your childhood, fear not. The company has worked hard to stay true to the game’s roots.
* All 30 MLB clubs are represented with 480 active players. Each player has characteristics based on statistical data that MLB.com collects from the League’s games. The ball player body builds are thin, average, or bulky, which fits with the original graphics.
* The game features two-button controls to manage the gameplay. You can invest long periods of time by playing full seasons, or grab a quick snack and play nine innings in about 20 minutes.

* In addition to full seasons, players can enjoy Postseason and Exhibition modes. Each team has three jerseys including home, road and alternate. Players can also unlock retro jerseys and earn achievements by playing custom team-specific challenges. Play with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the classic style Twins and Padres, and even the Cincinnati “Big Red Machine” uniforms.
* This is the MLB’s first console game title under the company’s Advanced Media, or MLBAM department. Today’s iOS release is only part of a wide platform launch. It is also available on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for $19.99, with the Xbox One and Playstation 4 versions coming this spring.
* R.B.I. Baseball 14 is available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for $4.99. Download it in the App Store today.
* Did you play R.B.I. Baseball as a kid? Are you exited for this modernized version?
