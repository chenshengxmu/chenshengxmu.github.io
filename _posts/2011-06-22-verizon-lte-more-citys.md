* Verizon seems to be really motivated to hit their goal of 175 markets using LTE technology by the end of this year. The carrier announced 19 new markets and 2 new cities a little over a week ago, and is now announcing even more coverage.
* Verizon issued a press release yesterday stating that they plan to add another 13 markets by July 21 of this year. Though there are still plenty of bugs to be ironed out, Big Red’s LTE network is without a doubt leading the 4G race in the United States…
* Verizon launched their 4G network late last year in just a handful of markets. The LTE connection was initially available in 38 cities and 60 airports. Since then, Verizon has been rolling out the service to new areas as quick as possible.
* The company’s aggressive 4G build out and marketing has practically left Sprint’s WiMax network in the dust. Not to mention the serious lead its given them over AT&T, who is expecting to launch their LTE network later this year.
* There’s been a lot of speculation suggesting that the next iPhone will not be 4G-capable. But with so many major carriers adopting LTE technology, you can expect to see an LTE iPhone within the next year. At least it looks like the U.S. will be prepared.
* Any of our Verizon readers use the LTE service? Opinions?
