* Today, I got my first chance to try out Multiplexer, the highly anticipated upcoming multitasking tweak from Elijah Frederickson and Andrew Abosh, that’s currently setting the jailbreak community ablaze.
* Multiplexer can rightly be labeled as an “ultimate multitasking tweak”, because it basically combines six multitasking-oriented jailbreak tweaks into one.
* The tweak blends traditional side-by-side multitasking options along with enhanced backgrounding, and multiple desktops. But all of that is just the tip of the iceberg. Step inside as we give you the first hands-on look at Multiplexer on video.
* Once you install Multiplexer, you’ll find a new preference panel in the stock Settings app. At the root of the Multiplexer preferences, you’ll find an overall kill switch along with a Theme panel.
* The Theme panel allows you to choose between two different themes—Default and Dark—and where applicable, it affects all tweaks under the Multiplexer umbrella.

* Speaking of tweaks, as mentioned, Multiplexer is a legit six tweaks in one. Each of the parts that make up Multiplexer contain a separate preference panel inside of Multiplexer’s preferences. They are as follows:
* Needless to say, there’s a whole lot to this tweak—so much that it’s honestly a little overwhelming. With this in mind, I’m thinking about posting a new post each day to break down each part of the release.

* In the meantime, enjoy our hands-on preview walkthrough of Multiplexer. It doesn’t go super in depth on any one aspect of the release, but it provides you with enough of a high level overview so that you know what to expect when it drops later this month for $3.99.
* What do you think?
