* While we haven’t seen a major iOS update in almost a year, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Apple has announced that it will be introducing the world to iOS 5 in June.
* Their exact words were, “Join us for a preview of the future of iOS and Mac OS X.” This leads us to believe that the software won’t be available exactly at that time. So, how long are we going to have to wait for the next major firmware release?
* FutureTap, the company behind popular Where To? travel app, tweeted today that they received their first iOS 5.0 crash report. “MKUserLocationBreadCrumb” was the API that faltered, and I have to agree with the developers, it sounds interesting.
* Several mobile and built-in navigation systems feature some type of breadcrumb option. This allows users to see a visual trail of where they have been recently, which can be useful for several reasons (see The Hangover).
* There has certainly been a lot of speculation regarding Apple giving its Maps application a serious makeover. Not to mention all of the media attention they have gotten over user location data in the past few weeks.
* Developers receiving notice that Apple is testing the new iOS software is a good sign. Hopefully Apple starts to seed the new OS to developers in the next few months, so we can start dissecting it for new features.
* With a lot of rumors suggesting that the next iPhone won’t feature a major hardware redesign, Apple certainly has their work cut out for them with iOS 5 if they want to impress the masses.
* What if the next operating system only runs on dual core processors? Maybe that’s their plan to get everyone to upgrade. Hopefully we’ll know a lot more in June.
* What do you think?
