* Continuing with its wave of updates today, Apple has posted a new build of iTunes Connect for iOS. The update brings the app to version 3.0, and includes a long-awaited UI redesign in-line with the new look of iOS 7.
* For those unfamiliar with iTunes Connect, it’s what allows developers to access sales data for their apps and e-books. And with today’s update, artists can now use the app to access data for moves and other media as well…
* Here are the 3.0 release notes:
* iTunes Connect has been completely redesigned to make it even easier to manage your products. In addition, you can now use the iTunes Connect app to access the music, movies, and TV shows you have made available on the iTunes Store.
* If you’re interested, you can find the new iTunes Connect app, for both the iPhone and iPad, in the App Store for free. Obviously, though, you’ll need to be a registered developer or iTunes artist to get any use out of it.
