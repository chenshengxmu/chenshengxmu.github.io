* PullToClear is a new free jailbreak tweak by iOS developer CreatureSurvive that lets you quickly and effortlessly every unread notification from either Notification Center or the Lock screen.
* Once installed, you can pull down from either interface to reveal the hidden “Pull To Clear” action, as shown above. Pulling down further reveals the “Release To Clear” action.
* After you see “Release To Clear,” you can let go of your device’s screen, and every notification magically disappears from the interface you invoked the gesture on. One thing to note is that if you use this gesture on the Lock screen, then the notifications remain in Notification Center (and vice-versa).

* PullToClear doesn’t stop at useful functionality; it also includes user configuration so that you can customize the tweak’s look and feel. You’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app for setting the tweak up:

* The options here include:
* As you can see in the screenshot examples above, the tweak provides a bevy of different fonts to choose from. The preference pane also lacks a respring button because all changes take effect immediately.
* PullToClear adds a pleasant gesture to iOS for removing all unwanted notifications from either the Lock screen or Notification Center, but it doesn’t mark them as read. That said, you still need to acknowledge the apps that you have pending notifications from to clear the icon badges from your Home screen.
* PullToClear seems like a great tweak, and if you’d like to try it out for yourself, it’s available as a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. PullToClear works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices and the developer open-sourced the tweak on GitHub.
* Note: You may need to install one of the tweak’s dependencies (libcscolorpicker) from the developer’s beta repository until a discrepancy in the BigBoss repository gets fixed. To do that, just add the following third-party repository to Cydia:
