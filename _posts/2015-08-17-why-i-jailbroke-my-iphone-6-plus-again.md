title: Why I jailbroke my iPhone 6 Plus again and why you should consider it as well

* I’ve been running the iOS 9 beta on my iPhone 6 Plus and have been using the iPhone 5s as my jailbroken device for the last 2-3 weeks. My idea was to use the iPhone 5s as my jailbreak device, and keep my daily driver—my iPhone 6 Plus—jailbreak free.
* But once Apple released the jailbreak-killing iOS 8.4.1, my tune changed. I decided to go back to iOS 8.4 and jailbreak my iPhone 6 Plus again. Why’d I do it? I explain in this post…
* My decision to re-jailbreak my daily driver was all about timing. We’re so close to the iPhone 6s event, a little less than a month away. I presume that in about a month or so, we’ll have the new iPhone 6s Plus’ in hand.
* With this in mind, my iPhone 6 Plus would then be “retired” so to speak, and my iPhone 6s Plus would become my new daily driver.
* When you consider the strong possibility that Apple will stop signing iOS 8.4 this week, which will make it impossible to downgrade to iOS 8.4 and jailbreak, then it was a pretty easy decision for me.
* I can live without iOS 9 on my daily driver for another month if it means that I get to keep my jailbreak on a powerful device like the iPhone 6 Plus.
* It does bum me out a bit that this decision means I’ll have to forgo using my watchOS 2 enabled Apple Watch for the next month, but at the end of the day it was an easy decision.
* The decision was made even easier when you consider the fact that Cydia Impactor will allow you to perpetually restore to iOS 8.4 and in theory, maintain a jailbroken device forever. I plan on keeping my iPhone 6 Plus jailbroken forever if I can help it, and I highly suggest you look into the possibility of doing so as well.
* If you aren’t jailbroken on your latest and greatest device, I suggest downgrading now before it’s too late, and enjoy a “forever jailbreak” on that device. Then, once you receive your new iPhone next month, you can enjoy iOS 9 on it, and your jailbreak on your older device.
* What do you think about my idea?
