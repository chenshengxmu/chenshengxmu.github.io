* “Good evening, Dave.”
* Yes, the inevitable has finally happened, we’re just curious why it took so long.
* Indeed, Siri has finally been laced with a classic HAL 9000 theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.
* It’s all possible thanks to a WinterBoard theme, and a handful of UISounds that replace the stock Siri sounds. Check out our how-to video inside…
* Installing the Siri9000 visual theme is easy enough, but getting the sounds to go along with it is a tad more complicated. Be sure to follow our video instructions for the full how to.
* What do you think about Siri finally acquiring the classic voice from HAL 9000?
* For those interested, this WinterBoard theme works with jailbroken iOS 5 devices, including non-iPhone 4S devices running Spire.
* Siri9000 Theme is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let us know if you decide to take it for a ride.
