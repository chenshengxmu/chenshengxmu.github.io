* We’ve got another TweakWeek entry for you. This one comes from Andrea Oliva and might just be a godsend for folks who enjoy a good impromptu sing-along.
* PlayingLyrics is a unique jailbreak utility that can instantly bring up the lyrics of a currently playing track. The cool thing is that you can use Activator to assign a button or gesture to the function, so your song lyrics are available at all times…
* PlayingLyrics follows the typical tweak etiquette. There’s no icons installed on your spring board, and this particular utility doesn’t add anything to your Settings app either.
* Once downloaded, simply hop into your Settings app and fire up Activator. Select which button or gesture you want to activate PlayingLyrics, and then respring. Now just make sure a song is playing, and perform the set action.
* The catch is that your songs must already have the lyrics embedded in them via iTunes. You can do this by right-clicking on a song in iTunes. and selecting Get Info > Lyrics.
* Although tapping an album cover in the iPod app brings up song lyrics, this utility allows you to access them from any screen. Ok, I’m still trying to figure out why I need it, but it’s cool nonetheless. You can grab PlayingLyrics in Cydia for free.
* Have you tried PlayingLyrics yet? What do you think?
