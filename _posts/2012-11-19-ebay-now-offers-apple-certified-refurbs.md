* eBay earlier this month started offering Apple-certified refurbished products on its web store. With Apple’s Black Friday teaser and 2012 Holiday Gift Guide now live, we thought highlight eBay’s offering would appeal to cash-strapped shoppers. Available right here as a new section on the auction site, eBay’s Apple Certified Refurbished Products list is akin to Apple’s own refurbished offering in that both have passed through the same quality inspection. You should definitely consider refurbs and here’s why…
* The iPads, iPods and MacBooks are all available at a reduced price and include a one-year warranty, a re-installed operating system and bundled software and come repackaged with manual and cable.
* Even better, all iPads and iPods include a brand new battery. These products are good as new and have only been used lightly. Prices, of course, are notably lower compared to retail prices of their non-refurbished counterparts.
* PhoneArena highlights two deals:
* For example, a 64GB Apple-certified refurbished, 3rd-gen, Wi-Fi-only Black iPad can be purchased for $549 compared to $699 brand new, a $150, or 21 percent discount.
* And a 15.4″ Apple MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHz processor, 4GB of synchronous dynamic random access memory and a 750GB hard drive is being offered at $1,699 compared to $1,999 brand new, a $300, or 15 percent discount.
* Neither eBay nor Apple at press time offered refurbished iPhones.
* If you’re among the people who deem Apple hardware overpriced, refurbs offer an awesome opportunity to get your hands on good-as-new products that can save you a bundle.
* Those of you who bought a refurbished Apple product, please share your experience with others down in the comments.
