* Reeder, a popular RSS client for iOS and OS X by Italian developer Silvio Rizzi, has been bumped up to version 2.2 today.
* The $4.99 iPhone and iPad application has notably picked up support for Background App Refresh, an iOS 7 technology which delivers new app content automatically and in the background, so the app is always up-to-date whenever you fire it up.
* Reeder 2.2 also includes visual tweaks such as a new loading progress indicator for the in-app browser and refinements like a new setting to disable favicons for subscriptions and article lists. The full list of changes is right after the break…
* Your smart streams can now be used to group content by feed or date.
* Reeder 2.0 now handles feed links (feed://) from external apps, Messages sharing has been vastly improved (now includes the title and link), there are new authentication methods for Pocket (OAuth) and Pinboard (API token) and some new gestures and subtle refinements.
* For example, the app now includes a left/right navigation pan on toolbars, list views have more white space to them and a brand new drag handle on the browser toolbar makes it clearer that you can slide right/left to go back/forward.
* Rizzi has moved Reeder’s unread dot to the upper right of the row, which makes for a more consistent appearance with the current Reeder for Mac beta.
* Reeder 2.2 includes the following bug fixes:
* • That really annoying bug where an article might just disappear when launching the app • Multiple Feedly accounts • OPML import issues • Disappearing status bar (white theme on iPad) • Don’t select entries when scrolling • Browser scroll issues with fixed elements • Missing scrollbars in the browser • Missing scrollbars for dark themes • Improved Fever error handling (re-login bug)
* This update is free for existing users.
* You can buy Reeder 2.2 for $4.99 in the App Store.
* iOS 7.0 or later is required.
