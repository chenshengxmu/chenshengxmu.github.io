* Can you feel it in the air? I surely can. I get the same feeling before virtually every big jailbreak solution.
* There’s an eerie quiet among the folks taking the lead in the jailbreaking community, demos have been demonstrated, and tweets have been tweeted.
* Now all we can do is wait, and wait patiently. Although we’re expecting it literally any hour or day now, it’s always a nice surprise when it finally arrives…
* To tide us over, MuscleNerd dropped a few hints about the imminence of the Dev Team’s new version of RedSn0w and PwnageTool; each will support 4.3.1…

* From what we can discern from MuscleNerd’s tweets, along with updated versions of RedSn0w and PwnageTool, we can expect support for the Apple TV 2 as well.
* Unfortunately for all of you folks patiently waiting for a jailbreak for your iPad 2’s the wait is going to be a bit longer.
* If you’re on an iPad 2, you’re probably going to want to stick with iOS 4.3, since Comex’s jailbreak was reportedly fixed by Apple in iOS 4.3.1.
* The good news is that a jailbreak for the iPhone is still a go on iOS 4.3.1, and we can literally expect it anytime now.
* Stay tuned to iDB for the news, and a full walkthrough of the jailbreak process once it touches down.
* What do you plan on doing?
