* Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. After the EA sale, and the Disney and Warner Bros. sale, and the App Santa sale, I’m just not sure how many more purchases my wallet can handle. Luckily, I already own two of the three apps we’re going to be talking about this morning.
* Flexibits announced via their Twitter account last night that they have placed all of their apps on sale for the holidays. That means that for a limited time, you can snag the popular Fantastical app for Mac and iPhone, as well as the Chatology messaging app, at a nice discount…

* As a lot of you may know, we’re pretty big fans of Fantastical here at iDB and we typically cover major releases for both the Mac and iOS apps. If you’d like more info on the software, check out our full review here. Otherwise, we have some brief overviews of the apps below.
* Presenting the calendar app you’ll actually enjoy using. Type in that you have “Lunch with John on Friday at 1pm” and Fantastical will schedule it! Or type in that you need to “Buy milk by Tuesday” and Fantastical will create a reminder with a due date!
* Fantastical’s natural language event/reminder creation, beautiful calendar, and gorgeous list make it the best calendar you’ll ever use. Stay on top of your schedule with features like native CalDAV support, automatic alarms for new events, OS X and iOS reminder support, and instant search.
* Fantastical is $9.99 (normally $19.99) in the Mac App Store.
* The award-winning, best-selling calendar app has been redesigned and reimagined for iOS 7, including new features such as reminders, a new week view, and much more!
* Just enter “Lunch with Elon in Palo Alto on Friday” and Fantastical 2 will schedule it! Or type in “todo buy milk at 5pm” and a reminder will alert you at 5PM! If your device supports dictation* you can speak the details for your event or reminder and Fantastical 2 will handle the rest.
* Fantastical 2 is $1.99 (normally $4.99) in the App Store.

* If you use Messages or iChat, you probably know that searching messages to find important info from past chats can be frustrating. Perhaps you couldn’t find what you were looking for, or your Mac slowed down so much that you gave up.
* Chatology helps you find exactly what you’re looking for without frustration. Chatology understands chats from all the favorite services you already use with Messages, such as iMessage, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Google Talk, Yahoo, Jabber, and Facebook.
* Chatology is $9.99 (normally $19.99) in the Flexibits Store.
* There’s no word on when this sale ends, but we imagine it will at least run through next Wednesday.
