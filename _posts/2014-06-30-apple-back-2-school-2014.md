* MacRumors is reporting that Apple is set to launch its annual ‘Back to School’ promotion in the US and several other countries beginning tomorrow—Tuesday, July 1st. The company runs the promo at various times in different regions, depending on their respective educational calendars.
* According to the site, Apple will be offering up iTunes Store/App Store gift cards to students that purchase a Mac, iPad, or iPhone. Similar to last year, it sounds like students will receive a $100 App Store gift card for the purchase of a new Mac, and a $50 card for new iOS device purchases…
* Here’s more from MacRumors’ Julie Clover:
* According to a source who spoke to MacRumors, Apple’s 2014 Back to School promotion will be similar to the 2013 promotion, providing students with a $100 App Store gift card for the purchase of a new Mac or a $50 App Store gift card with the purchase of an iPad or iPhone. 
* Last year, the promotion was available in the following markets: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and of course the United States, and we expect to see similar countries this year.
* Also worth noting is that the deal is typically available in Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores, via Authorized Apple Campus Stores, and through Apple.com. 9to5Mac reports that Apple has scheduled an overnight refresh of its store visuals tonight, so expect an announcement early tomorrow morning.
