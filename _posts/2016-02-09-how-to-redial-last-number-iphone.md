* Using a 3D Touch gesture on the Phone app icon gives you shortcuts for calling your favorite contacts right from the Home screen. But aside from 3D Touch, the Phone app has received little innovation in years past.
* That being said, a lot of iPhone owners are not completely familiar with the ins and outs of the Phone app beyond making and receiving phone calls. Many of my friends, for instance, routinely go to Phone → Recents to call the last dialed number.
* Apple’s interface designers have thought of that, too, but unfortunately their solution is not readily apparent in Phone’s interface. In this quick tutorial, we’ll teach you how to call the last dialed number right from Phone’s Keypad section.
* 1) Open the Phone app on your iPhone.
* 2) Tap Keypad at the bottom.
* 3) Tap the green Call button once.
* 4) The number you dialed last appears at the top of the interface. Now tap the Call button again to redial that last number and place a call to it.

* You can also use Siri or Voice Control: just press and hold the Home button and say “Redial that last number”.
* How do you like this handy little shortcut?
