* iOS 6 has a ton of new features, and like always, Apple has created a new page highlighting the upgrade’s most compelling bullet points.
* We’ve covered all of the major features here on iDB, but it’s always nice to see how Apple themselves present the update.
* Inside you’ll find highlights for new features like updated maps, Facebook integration, new Siri features, Passbook, Shared Photo Streams, and much, much, more.
* Again, you can find the new iOS 6 preview page here: apple.com/ios/ios6/
* What do you think about iOS 6? Did Apple knock it out of the ballpark with this one?
