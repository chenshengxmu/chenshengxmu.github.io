* Tapbots has released an update for its popular Twitter desktop client Tweetbot for Mac this afternoon, bumping the app to version 1.6. Tweetbot now supports viewing and posting multiple images using the built-in Twitter photo service, although multiple images won’t show up in search or the streaming timeline until Twitter enables the feature in the future… 
* The new version also clearly distinguishes Instagram videos by marking them with a play icon, alongside various bug fixes. The update is available from the Mac App Store, weighing in at 1.5 MB. Tweetbot is a full-featured Twitter client for OS X, with multiple timelines and column views, inline media preview thumbnails, mute filters, tweet drafts, local and worldwide trends, iCloud syncing and more.
* The official changelog:
* I personally use Tweetbot on a daily basis, and I cannot recommend it enough for Mac users. The app has earned a permanent spot on my second display because of its beautiful user interface and useful features. As a blogger, support for multiple windows and list views makes it much easier to discover and curate content that readers like you will care about. The only thing holding the app back is a hefty price tag, but it’s money well spent in my opinion.
* Tweetbot is $19.99 on the Mac App Store.
