* I wish Apple put me out of my misery and released the iPhone 6 already because an influx of videos comparing those questionable dummy units to just about anything is overwhelming me. Just this morning, for example, I pointed you to a video which shows off the supposed minor changes in the next iPad’s design.
* Now I’ve decided to highlight another video that I think does a great job explaining how the bigger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 would compare to popular 5.5-inch Android handsets such as the LG G3, Oppo Find 7 and One Plus One.
* It’s right after the break so give it a quick watch and join us in comments for a healthy discussion…
* In this video, YouTuber Danny Winget delivers a size comparison between a 5.5-inch iPhone 6 dummy unit (based off the rumors) and several Android handsets that incorporate a 5.5-inch screen.
* A screen measuring 5.5 inches diagonally would mark a significant departure from the current four-inch iPhones and put Apple’s iconic smartphone into the so-called phablet category.
* As a result, the device would compete squarely against Samsung’s Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S5, LG’s G3, Sony’s Xperia Z2 and phones like the Oppo Find 7 and the One Plus One.
* According to our non-scientific poll, respondents are predominantly leaning toward a 4.7-inch model, with nearly one out of each three respondents preferring the bigger model.
* Leaked information suggests that the new iPhones should go on sale on September 19 so we’re expecting a media event in early-September though nothing is set in stone until those invites go out.
