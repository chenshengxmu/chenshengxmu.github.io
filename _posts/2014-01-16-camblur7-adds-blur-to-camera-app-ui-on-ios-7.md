* While it is not the most groundbreaking jailbreak tweak on Cydia, CamBlur7 is a new package that works in unison with TransparentCameraBar to add a translucent blur effect to the top and bottom bar of the Camera app UI on iOS 7. The tweak has a number of options that are configurable through the Settings app for adjusting the blur level and hiding the blur in filter or video mode… 
* “Full-screen preview” and “camera bottom bar opacity” must be enabled in TransparentCameraBar in order for CamBlur7 to function correctly. Afterwards, your Camera app should have a glossier user interface with a blurred effect akin to your Home screen showing through Control Center or Notification Center. It’s a simple tweak, quite frankly, but one that does make the Camera app look more similar to the rest of iOS 7.
* CamBlur7 is compatible with all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models, including 64-bit devices like the iPhone 5s and iPad Air, and is available now on Cydia in the BigBoss repository. The extension seems to perform well, without hogging too much system memory. You’ll notice that TransparentCameraBar is automatically installed on the side, so no separate download is required.
* If you give this tweak a spin, let us know how it works for you in the comments.
