title: First gameplay video of Angry Birds Star Wars
---
* A new Star Wars-themed Angry Birds game, part of a broad merchandizing partnership with toy maker Hasbro, is due November 8. It’s currently marketed under an SEO-optimized Angry Birds Star Wars moniker and we previously showed you the original teaser and a trailer featuring Princess Leia. Today, Finnish developer Rovio is out with another amusing video depicting romance in the making between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
* It also lets us in on gameplay action and mechanics. Looks like birds-slinging remains the focus of the game. This upcoming puzzler will introduce a host of crazy and officially licensed Star Wars-themed characters, each with its own personality and skills. I love how one of the birds is waving Lightsabers to penetrate the thick walls…
* Not sure about you, but the game looks fun, if this trailer is anything to go by.
* I’m a huge fan of Star Wars so my judgement is perhaps slanted a bit.
* What do you think?
* Is Angry Birds Star Wars a welcome addition to the lineup or should Rovio stop milking the franchise for all its worth?
