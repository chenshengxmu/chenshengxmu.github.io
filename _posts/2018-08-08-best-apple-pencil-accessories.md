* Are you looking to make your Apple Pencil even better? How about some accessories? Here are some of the best Apple Pencil accessories now available.
* The Apple Pencil first arrived on the scene in November 2015 when it was released exclusively for the iPad Pro. Two years later, Apple introduced the first budget iPad to also support the writing device. As the Apple Pencil has grown in popularity so too has the number of accessories for the device. These have taken many forms including charging docks, cases, and more. Here are some of the hottest Apple Pencil accessories now on the market.
* The Apple Pencil doesn’t take much time to recharge. In just 15 seconds, you can add a 30-minute charge, while a fully charged pencil will give you 12 hours of continuous use. To charge the pencil, Apple wants you to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port. This works, but it also looks goofy, at best. Thankfully, third-parties have introduced several stands and chargers that make the charging process a little bit more organized.

* The TechMatte Charging Dock/Stand for Apple Pencil allows you to charge your iPad’s drawing and writing device while still looking stylish and sleek on your desk. Made of solid aluminum, the stand matches the look of Apple products and holds both your pencil and cap so that neither will get lost. 
* Regularly priced at $19.99, the TechMatte makes a great addition to any work environment, whether at your home or place of business.
* $19.99 at Amazon

Like the TechMatte, the BlueFire offers a protective cap holder to keep your pencil top safe and secure while charging.

* You should also consider:
* At first, you might not consider it necessary to have an Apple Pencil case. However, when you realize that the cost of replacement is $100, you might reconsider. Cases help protect the writing instrument when not in use. They also add some spark to a device in desperate need of some color.

The sleeve also comes with two extra self-adhering metal strips that will enable you to connect the wiring device to any surface. With a soft silicone grip, the FRTMA hugs the pencil tightly to prevent relative sliding.
