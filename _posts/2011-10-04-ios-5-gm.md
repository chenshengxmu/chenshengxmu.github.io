* Although it wasn’t mentioned during the presentation, Apple just made iOS 5 GM available to developers. This Golden Master update is as close as it gets to the official release of iOS 5, which will happen on October 12th.
* You must use iTunes 10.5 beta 7 to install iOS 5 GM seed on your devices as the iOS 5 GM seed is not available via over-the-air software update feature…
* iOS 5 GM is available from the Dev Center for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
