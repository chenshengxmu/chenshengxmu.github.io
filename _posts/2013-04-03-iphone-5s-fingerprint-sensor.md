* What voice-recognition did for the iPhone 4S, fingerprints will do for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 5S, one technology analyst is telling investors. For the second time, an Apple observer forecasts a fingerprint sensor as a key feature of a new iPhone expected this summer. Such a sensor would let iPhone 5S owners use their fingerprints instead of passwords, as well as open the possibility of mobile credit card payments, according to a Wednesday report…
* Analyst Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets made the comments after touring parts suppliers in China and Taiwan, reports AppleInsider, which obtained the analyst’s research note.
* The analyst described a fingerprint sensor devoted to “essential security purposes.”
* White likened a fingerprint sensor to the introduction of Siri along with the 4S, becoming a key selling point for the iPhone 5S which White believes will appear in July.
* He also linked the sensor to another highly-rumored Apple device, the iWatch. According to the analyst, the iWatch would also read users’ fingerprints
* And in a comment meant to suggest the iWatch is more than speculation, White described “early signs of movement in the supply chain,” according to the tech blog.

* This is not the first mention of fingerprint sensors being part of a future iPhone.
* Earlier this year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple would include such a sensor under the iPhone 5S home button.
* Talk of adding a fingerprint sensor to the iPhone also gained credibility after Apple paid $356 million to acquire AuthenTec.
* The company produced smart sensors which let fingerprint readers be included under touchscreen displays. White also added to the long-running debate over whether Apple will introduce a television set.
* According to the analyst, Apple plans an “iRing” which when worn on a user’s finger, helps any iTV detect motion.
