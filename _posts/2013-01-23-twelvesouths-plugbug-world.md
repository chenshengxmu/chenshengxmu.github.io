* TwelveSouth makes wonderful accessories for Apple devices and their charging add-on called PlugBug is the perfect epitome of their design approach: not only is the accessory useful, it’s damn cute, too. For the uninitiated, the PlugBug will charge your MacBook and iPhone (or iPad or iPod touch) at the same time. The charming little red thingie piggy-backs onto your MacBook’s power adapter and has a 10W USB port to connect and charge your iDevice as the MacBook adapter simultaneously juices up your notebook.
* How cool is that? Today, a year and half following its debut, TwelveSouth has announced the PlugBug World, an international version with five swappable prong adapters supporting power sockets in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, North America, Hong Kong, China and a bunch of other markets…
* Here are all your prong adapters.

* TwelveSouth explains:
* PlugBug World is the global version of our popular PlugBug and brings dual charging convenience to Mac users everywhere. People living in the UK, Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, North America, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Japan and many other places can use PlugBug World to charge their MacBook and iPad or iPhone at the same time using one electrical outlet.
* World travelers know how frustrating it can be to check in to a hotel in Asia or Bangladesh or Belgrade only to find out that damn wall sockets are incompatible with all your devices.
* Use PlugBug World at home, in the office, at a coffee shop or anywhere else where outlets are scarce. Going on a trip out of the country? PlugBug World is all you need to charge your MacBook and iPad/iPhone pretty much anywhere you go.
* I don’t travel much, but when I do I never leave home without my $39 Apple World Travel Adapter Kit from Apple.
* But just looking at TwelveSouth’s gizmo makes me instantly want one!
* The new PlugBug World is a $45 value, if you’re interested. The original PlugBug is still available for $35. More information is available in the official blog post.
* Don’t forget to choose Free Ground Shipping if you live in the Continental United States (buyers oversea, check out TwelveSouth’s global flat-rate shipping options).
