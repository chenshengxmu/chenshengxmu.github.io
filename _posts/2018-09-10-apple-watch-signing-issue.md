* On Monday, Apple alerted some developers of a signing issue that’s preventing some Apple Watch apps from working correctly. The problem was first reported by MacRumors.
* Here’s the email Apple’s sending out to some developers:
* We’ve discovered that there was a temporary issue with the App Store signature of your binaries that affects the ability of your app to install on Apple Watch. As a result, we’re pushing an update with the proper signing to customers’ devices.
* MacRumors says it isn’t sure what went wrong, although it looks like the update being pushed out will resolve the issue.
* On Wednesday, Apple’s expected to announce the fourth-generation Apple Watch. Soon after, current wearable devices users should receive the watchOS 5 software update.
* First announced in June, watchOS 5 offers improvements to the Siri watch face, activity competitions, auto-workout detection, Yoga and Hiking workouts, and the ability track cadence. Additionally, the update brings improved Notifications, Podcasts and Walkie-Talkie apps, student ID cards, and web-view for links.
