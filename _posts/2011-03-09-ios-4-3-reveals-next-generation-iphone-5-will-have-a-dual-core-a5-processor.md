* With the official release of iOS 4.3 today, Chronic-Dev Team member, @chronic has been digging deep into the code and has found some new details regarding the next-generation iPhone.
* Looking deeper into the iOS 4.3 code reveals that the next-generation iPhone 5 will sport the same dual-core Apple A5 processor as the upcoming iPad 2. The devs have found references to a device with the model number N94AP, which supposedly is the next-generation iPhone 5. Taking a look inside the N94AP kernel reveals the model number “S5L8940“, which happens to be the same model number as the A5 processor chip inside the iPad 2…
* iPad2,1 (K93AP) = WiFi.
* iPad2,2 (K94AP) = GSM.
* iPad2,3 (K95AP) = CDMA.
* The A5 Processor, is called a ‘S5L8940′
* Although this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that the iPhone 5 will include a dual-core processor, it’s good to see some additional evidence confirming the rumors.
* Now that we can check that off on our list, lets see if we get that larger 4-inch display, increased storage capacity, or completely redesigned body in the next-generation iPhone.
* What do you think?
