* The Apple Watch world tour continues unabated with confirmation that the wearable device is slated to go on sale this week at John Lewis, the department store in the United Kingdom, Wearable reports.
* Currys, another mainstream UK-based department store, also announced on its website that it would be selling the Apple Watch “soon.”
* Both John Lewis and Currys will provide online support for Apple Watch sales as well.
* A “curated selection” of the device will launch in 37 branches of John Lewis stores around the United Kingdom, and on its online store, this Friday on September 18.
* Four more John Lewis outlets have confirmed Apple Watch availability by Christmas.
* “We believe Apple Watch will be one of the most sought after gifts this Christmas,” said Will Jones, head of buying communication technology at John Lewis.
* Currys is now accepting Apple Watch pre-order through its website. That company operates a chain of 295 superstores and 73 high street stores in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.
* Following its April 24 launch, UK customers have been able to pick up an Apple Watch in company-owned retail stores as well as via fashion boutiques and select upmarket launch partners including Dover Street Market in London, and other outlets in Australia and France.
* Last month, the Apple wearable arrived to Best Buy stores across the United States and Canada. The latest expansion comes ahead of this Wednesday’s public launch of iOS 9 and watchOS 2 software updates.
