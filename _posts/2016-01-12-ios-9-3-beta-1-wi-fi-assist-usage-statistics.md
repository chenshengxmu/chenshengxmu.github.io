* It’s now easier than ever to keep an eye on how much data is used by Wi-Fi assist, thanks to a new data monitor found in iOS 9.3 beta 1. Wi-Fi assist, is the controversial feature that taps into your iPhone’s cellular connection in those instances where the Wi-Fi connection may not be adequate enough.
* First noted by MacRumors’ Juli Clover, the addition of data usage numbers for Wi-Fi Assist will help those who claim to have experienced exorbitant amounts of cellular data usage due to the feature.
* To locate Wi-Fi assist usage statistics, simply do the following:
* Step 1: Open Settings
* Step 2: Open Cellular
* Step 3: Scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the Wi-Fi Assist switch. Beneath the switch’s name, you should see the amount of data used during the current usage period.
* If you’re still confused about why Wi-Fi Assist exists in the first place, then read Christian’s post where he did a fine job of explaining its ins and outs.
