* Since Apple introduced SiriKit with iOS10, a growing number of developers worldwide have worked out unique ways to intelligently embed Apple’s virtual assistant. When the likes of WhatsApp and Uber released their Siri compatible versions it was still hard to escape the flurry of news about it, but the novelty of Siri integration has certainly worn off a little in the interim.
* With the newsworthiness of Siri-ready apps sinking, it is more likely than not that some of the apps on your iPhone have secretly acquired Siri capabilities that you are entirely oblivious of. If you want to bring yourself up to date on what you may have been missing out on, it only takes a few clicks within the Settings app to unveil which of your apps have lately taken to Siri.
* Running counter to some people’s intuition, simply hitting for example Uber’s icon in the Settings section for third party apps does not give any indication as to whether or not Siri is actually harnessed by the app. Of course there is always trial and error for any app you are curious about, but if you grow tired of repeatedly snarling unintelligible commands at Siri, here is what you want to do in the interest of efficiency:
* 1) Open your Settings app.
* 2) Scroll down to find Siri, tap it.

* 3) Inside the Siri setting, summon App Support, which should be the very last submenu in the list.

* 4) You made it: the controls before you are a lot more valuable than its cached location suggests. In it, iOS automatically lists all third party apps on your iPhone boasting Siri support.

* Better yet, flicking a switch can give or repeal permission to Siri use, which puts you in total control over what data is going to get send over to Apple’s servers.
* Being up to speed on all your apps featuring Siri is great, but what words have to be uttered to trigger the shortcuts you ask? Well, a while ago we put together a list of commands for third party apps, which might start you off nicely. Apple also published blog posts of similar intent in August. Other than that, summoning Siri and clicking the small question mark in the bottom left corner does no longer only generate suggestions for stock app prompts, but now also puts forward third party material. If you scroll to the bottom of the list of suggestions, you will see a second column touching on exclusively those:

* This list comes in handy and should give you plenty of inspiration, however be aware that it is not comprehensive either. The screenshot above does not list app prompts corresponding to PayPal, Nike+ Run Club, LinkedIn or Pedometer.
* When push comes to shove and you cannot find instructions on how to cue a command, just try your luck with Siri. The name of the app plus a keyword (ask yourself, what’s the purpose of the app?) are almost sure to get Siri to compute your request.
* For your money, which third-party app presents the most useful (or fun) Siri integration to date? Share in the comments!
