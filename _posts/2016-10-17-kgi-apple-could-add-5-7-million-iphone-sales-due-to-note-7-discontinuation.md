* Global Note 7 recall and discontinuation could prove to be a blessing to Apple, helping the Cupertino firm boost iPhone sales by five to seven million units, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
* In a note to clients this morning, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, the analyst speculates that Apple and Chinese Android manufacturer Huawei could be the primary beneficiaries of the Note 7 discontinuation, with Apple potentially seeing an influx of orders for the iPhone 7 Plus due to its dual-camera system.
* Kuo also cautioned that another blunder similar to Note 7—especially on the upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone—would destroy the Samsung brand.
* From the report:
* Consumers that have switched from Note 7 to iPhone after the recall and halted production can be identified as having the following characteristics: (1) no trust in the Samsung brand anymore; (2) could be former iOS users; (3) like dual camera feature; and (4) like the subsidy packages of telecom operators (iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the most promoted flagship models in September).
* Kuo thinks that Apple’s biggest benefits of the Note 7 discontinuation may have already “peaked out” because the company may need up to five weeks to fulfill iPhone 7 Plus orders from ex-Note 7 customers, especially if it “does not expand the current production capacity of the iPhone 7 Plus.”
* Any benefits for Apple from the Note 7 fiasco are “largely reflected in raised forecasts” rather than in actual iPhone shipping numbers, reads the report.
* Huawei’s upcoming Mate 9 smartphone, due later this year, also features dual cameras, making it an interesting proposition for former Note 7 owners who want to stay in the Android ecosystem.
* Google’s recently launched Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone family is currently out of stock, but if Google manages to ramp up production quickly it could also reap some of the Note 7 customers.
* Korean news site ET News reported last week that Samsung is apparently “paying extra careful attention” to Galaxy S8 development due to “huge changes” in its design and hardware.
* But if the forthcoming phone turns out to suffer from similar mistakes as the Note 7, the Samsung brand “will be hurt immensely,” speculated the analyst.
