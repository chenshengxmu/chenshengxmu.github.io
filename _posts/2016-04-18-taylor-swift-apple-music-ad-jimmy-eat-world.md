* Following an amusing Apple Music commercial earlier this month in which pop artist Taylor Swift can be seen wiping out on the treadmill, a brand new ad for Apple’s music service was posted Monday on the official Beats 1 Radio channel on YouTube.
* In it, Swift is singing along to “The Middle” by Jimmy Eat World from their album “Jimmy Eat World”.
* The 60-second video, titled “Mic Drop”, shows Swift browsing Apple Music’s curated activity-based playlists before choosing one titled “Going Ready To Go Out” and finding a song she used to love in middle school.
* She then goes on to sing along to that song, in the bathroom, using her lipstick as a microphone, as she’s getting ready to go out. The clip closes with the tagline “Every song for every moment.”
* How do you like this new ad?
