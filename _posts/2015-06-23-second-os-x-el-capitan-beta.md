* Following the release of new watchOS 2 and iOS 9 betas, Apple on Tuesday seeded the second beta of OS X 10.11 El Capitan. The build is labeled as 15A204h, and is available to registered developers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store or through Apple’s Developer Center.
* Introduced two weeks ago at WWDC, OS X El Capitan is the next major version of Apple’s Mac operating system. The update does not include a ton of new features, but instead builds on top of last year’s OS X Yosemite with a number of performance and stability improvements.
* There are a few user-facing changes, though, such as a new system-wide font and a revamped Control Center with new Split Screen mode. Safari and Mail are also getting some nice updates, including new gesture controls and Pinned Tabs, and Spotlight Search is more intelligent.
* We are installing today’s beta now, and will report back with any major changes. OS X El Capitan is currently only available to registered developers, but Apple has said that it will be releasing a public version of the beta in July, and of course the official release is expected this fall.
