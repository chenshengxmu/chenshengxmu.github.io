* Apple may have stopped developing its AirPort-branded wireless base station devices, but it certainly continues to support users with timely software updates. Just today, they released new firmwares for the AirPort Express, Extreme and Time Capsule base stations.
* The AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.7.9 is available for all 802.11ac AirPort devices. The AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.6.9 is available for the older 802.11n base stations.
* The official release notes say that the new firmwares contain a patch for that widely reported KRACK vulnerabilities that plagued many modern Wi-Fi routers, networks and devices. Thankfully enough, Apple has already patched these dangerous WPA2 exploits in iOS and macOS.
* You can update your AirPort via Apple’s AirPort Utility app for iPhone, iPad and Mac.
* Make sure that you’re connected to the Internet and the same Wi-Fi network as your AirPort device, then launch AirPort Utility on your iOS or macOS device. If you see a numbered red badge next to the name of your base station, hit it for details.
* On Mac, the details view shows an Update button when a new firmware is available. On iOS devices, you must tap Version on the details screen, then Download and Install on the next.
* If you’re using your base station to share a hard drive on your network, you must make sure that none of the devices on your network are currently using that drive because the update process causes your AirPort and its network services to become temporarily unavailable.
* For detailed information on AirPort base station firmware updates, including instructions how to install the update, check out the support article on Apple’s website.
