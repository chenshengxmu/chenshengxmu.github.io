* Angry Birds maker Rovio earlier this morning announced that something will be announced next Monday, July 15. In a series of tweets, the company published a teaser image suggesting a successor to the Angry Birds Star Wars game. “We’re talking the biggest character line-up ever, awesome new powers, and maybe even a few surprises,” the Finnish developer wrote in blog post…
* The teaser image top of post is reminiscent of the original poster for the Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace movie. This gives us plenty of reasons to believe that the new Rovio game will be actually an Angry Birds Star Wars prequel.

* Rovio launched Angry Birds Star Wars on November 8, 2012.
* The game has been receiving content updates on a regular basis, adding new worlds and characters to expand on the Star Wars universe.
* Really excited for Monday’s announcement. Can’t wait to show you guys some of the cool new stuff we’ve been working on. #July15

* In recognizing the industry-wide preference towards the freemium model, Rovio recently slashed the original Angry Birds game to zero bucks.
* Celebrating the upcoming sequel, the publisher made Angry Birds Star Wars and Angry Birds Star Wars HD free on the App Store for a limited time so grab these now before the price goes back up again.
