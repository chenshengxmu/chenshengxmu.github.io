* Though Apple takes quite a bit of criticism, from both users and developers, over its rigorous App Store approval process, there is one significant benefit to the approach: security. iOS sees just a fraction of the viruses and malware as other, more open platforms.
* Case in point: the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which does work for the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the FBI, issued a warning late last week to smartphone users regarding malware for mobile phones. And unsurprisingly, there was a focus on Android…
* Fortune’s Apple 2.0 section points to the IC3 report, which highlights two versions of malware: Kozzfon and FinFisher. And here’s descriptions of each bug:
* Though the report seems to be geared more towards Android users, it’s worth noting that we have reported on an iOS version of FinFisher in the past. So we figured we’d share IC3’s preventative tips:
* You’ll notice that the sixth bullet point from the bottom says jailbreaking is a security risk. And while technically correct — jailbreaking does remove a lot of Apple’s security restrictions — we’ve been doing it for almost five years now without any major incidents.
* Anyway, the moral of the story here is that all mobile phones pose some sort of security risk. It is believed that iPhones are less susceptible to security breaches than other mobile platforms, but you should still be aware of these security concerns and tips as a safety measure.
