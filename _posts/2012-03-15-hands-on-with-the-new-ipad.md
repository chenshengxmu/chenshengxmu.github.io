* We just braved the storms to get our hands-on the new iPad to show our lovely readers this evening. Just as a reminder, the third-generation iPad out of Cupertino packs a stunning 2048 x 1536 Retina display, dual-core A5X processor with quad-core graphics, 5-megapixel camera with upgraded sensors, larger battery, LTE, and Dictation…
* All of the reviews were right: this Retina display is just absolutely stunning.
* Check out our first few moments with the new iPad:
