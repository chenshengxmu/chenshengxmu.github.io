* Apple will be live-streaming its WWDC 2017 event, just as they have for the last several years, so the world can tune in and see what’s new in the world of iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and more.
* No matter what type of device you’re using the day of the event, you can live-stream the keynote. In this piece, we’ll go over all the methods on how for every operating system and platform.
* The live stream is accessible on virtually any device, so long as you have the right software requirements to do so. One of the following setups is going to be required to watch the WWDC 2017 event live:
* How to watch WWDC 2017 on iPhone, iPad, or Mac
* If you’re using an Apple device to stream WWDC 2017, then you’re all set in terms of software, as long as everything is up to date.
* All you will have to do is visit the WWDC 2017 page at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) in Safari and wait for the event to begin. It should start playing as soon as Apple begins broadcasting; if it doesn’t just try refreshing the page and that should jump-start your viewing process.
* How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Apple TV
* If you’re fortunate enough to have an Apple TV and will be tuning in from the comfort of your own living room sofa, there’s a different process to stream WWDC 2017 on it depending on the type of Apple TV you have.
* On older Apple TVs (third-generation and earlier), an app icon is automatically added to the Home screen for tuning in to WWDC for your convenience.
* Fourth-generation Apple TV users will have to download the Apple Events app from the App Store to watch WWDC 2017 live.
* After the app is on your Apple TV Home screen, simply launch it before 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the streaming will begin on your TV set automatically.
* How to watch WWDC 2017 on an Android device
* If you’re on the other side of town and are tuning in from an Android device, then you’ll be happy to know there’s a process available for you as well. Just follow these steps:
* 1) Download and launch the VLC app, then tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream.
* 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL:
* https://p-events-delivery.akamaized.net/17qopibbefvoiuhbsefvbsefvopihb06/m3u8/hls_mvp.m3u8
* 3) Tap on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will be playing from your Android device through VLC.
* How to watch WWDC 2017 on a Windows PC
* If you’re using a Windows PC, then the steps to live-stream the WWDC 2017 keynote vary depending on the version of Windows you’re running.
* Windows 10 users can visit the WWDC 2017 page in the Microsoft Edge web browser at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST). Microsoft Edge supports HLS streaming, much like Safari does on your Mac or iOS device, which means you will get a seamless viewing experience.
* Windows 8.1 and earlier users can tune in by following these steps:
* 1) Download and open the VLC app, then go to Media > Open Network Stream from the top of the app’s interface.
* 2) When prompted to enter a source, enter the following URL:
* https://p-events-delivery.akamaized.net/17qopibbefvoiuhbsefvbsefvopihb06/m3u8/hls_mvp.m3u8
* 3) Click on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will play from VLC Media Player.
* If you’re not from the United States and you’re wondering when the WWDC 2017 keynote will begin for you, the following time zone conversions may be useful:
* If you’re as excited as we are to watch WWDC 2017 and see what Apple has in store, then be sure to stay tuned to iDB throughout and after the keynote for in-depth coverage of all the latest announcements and releases.
* We’re expecting to see previews of Apple’s next major firmware releases for Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac, as well as potential bumps to Mac hardware at the event. Some rumors have even suggested a new Siri Speaker may be on its way to compete with Amazon Echo and Google Now.
* As always, there will probably be surprises, as well as humorous blurbs.
