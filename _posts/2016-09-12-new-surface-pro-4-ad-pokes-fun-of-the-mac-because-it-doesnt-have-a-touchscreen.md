* Microsoft over the weekend fired another ad salvo at Apple’s tablet/computer strategy with a new (somewhat) amusing commercial. Simple titled “Get the Surface Pro,” the 30-second ad highlights Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 hybrid device which includes a stylus and comes with a detachable keyboard and an Intel chip allowing it to be transformed into a computer that runs Windows, Office and other real desktop applications.
* Using the same singer from the previous commercial, the new video informs us that “If you try to write on a plain old Mac, the difference can be seen. It doesn’t work.”
* “With a pen that lets you write on the screen, a detachable keyboard, and tunes like this, Surface Pro 4 is the easy choice,” says Microsoft.
* And here’s the new Surface ad.
* Microsoft’s anti-Apple campaign for the Surface Pro includes other stingy commercials, one calling the MacBook Air “less useful, like a hat for your cat” and the others boasting about such Surface Pro 4 features as Intel Core processor, detachable keyboard with real keys and a trackpad, pen, touchscreen, full Office and external ports.

* “Everything else is just late to the party,” argues Microsoft in another dig at Apple and its latest iPad Pro ads which attempt to position the device as a computer replacement.
* What was your first impression after seeing this new Surface ad?
