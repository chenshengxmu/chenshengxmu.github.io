* Apple noted yesterday that handy transcripts of all the session videos from its 2018 Worldwide Developers Conference are now available to the general public.
* Anyone can access the videos and transcripts via developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2018.
* “Take advantage of transcripts to quickly discover and share information presented in WWDC18 videos,” notes the firm. WWDC 2018 session videos can be searched by keyword.
* This lets you see all instances where the keyword like, say, “grouped notifications” is mentioned in the video. You can even go straight to the time the term was mentioned and share a link to that specific time.
