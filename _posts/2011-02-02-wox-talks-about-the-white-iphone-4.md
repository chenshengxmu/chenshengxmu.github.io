* A couple of days ago, Alex wrote a post about Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak who had gone on record saying that the white iPhone 4 would be available soon. Oops, he did it again by confirming yet again to Engadget that the white iPhone 4 will be available in a short period of time.
* The video below shows Woz dropping the white bomb on Engadget TV. I love the reason why he carries two iPhones with him all the time (to solve the battery problem). It’s definitely worth a watch. Woz is the kind of guy you just want to listen to for hours. That’s how I feel anyway…
* Thoughts?
