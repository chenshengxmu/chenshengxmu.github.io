* Apple is now testing the next major OS X Yosemite update with public beta testers, shortly after making OS X 10.10.5 beta 1 available to members of the Apple Beta Software Program. The software has the same build number of ’14F6a’ like the developer seed of OS X 10.10.5 which was released two days ago, implying identical code.
* The pre-release software can be downloaded through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab on Macs enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program.
* After signing up for the public beta program, just choose Software Update or App Store from the Apple menu to grab the update through the Mac App Store.
* “The OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac,” as per the official release notes for OS X 10.10.5 beta.
* OS X 10.10.5 should be primarily a bug-fix release as the document makes no mention of any new features, and is likely one of the last major software updates for Yosemite ahead of El Capitan’s release this fall.
* The previous OS X 10.10.4 software update was released alongside iOS 8.4 on June 30.
* In addition to enabling support for Apple Music, OS X 10.10.4 has resolved annoying Wi-Fi issues by replacing the problematic ‘Discoveryd’ network process with the more reliable ‘mDNSResponder’ process.
