* EA Mobile and PopCap Games unleashed the long-anticipated Plants vs. Zombies 2 last Thursday and already the free-to-play game has amassed a respectable sixteen million downloads on the App Store, making it the most successful mobile game launch in EA’s history.
* Matter of fact, the game has achieved one of the biggest opening weekends on the App Store ever for a mobile game title, EA boasted. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll be delighted to learn that the first major content update is coming soon…
* EA’s press release shares a few interesting stats regarding the game.
* For example, Plants vs. Zombies 2 in just five days emerged as the top iPhone and iPad game on the App Store in 137 countries worldwide.
* Players have generated over eleven billion suns and more than two billion zombie waves.
* “We are grateful and delighted with the incredible reception Plants vs. Zombies 2 has received from consumers around the globe,” said Tony Leamer, Franchise Business Director for Plants vs. Zombies.
* “We certainly had high hopes for the game, but to see fans playing the game so quickly and in such huge numbers is truly amazing.”
* Thus far, there have been more than four billion plants planted and people have spent over 25 million hours playing the game.
* Jostiq reported earlier today that a major ‘Far Future’ content update is coming soon, though no other details on the update’s launch were provided at post time.
* The universal Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time app is available free from the App Store. The game will become available for other platforms “later this year and beyond,” EA said.
