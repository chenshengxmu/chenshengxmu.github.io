* Tonight, the Instagram app has been updated to version 2.1, which has added three new features…
* Instagram 2.1′s coolest new feature is Lux. Lux is a new way to enhance your photos, and can be done by simply clicking the image. The Next Web shows off the enhancements lux adds above.
* The app has also been updated with a new and simplified UI. The new UI is noticeably quicker, less cluttered, and also features a new notification system. Instagram’s new designer Tim Van Damme, who was hired in December, is responsible for most of the UI enhancements. Lastly, Instagram has added a new filter called Sierra — which has a 70s look to it.
* You can download the updated Instagram on the iTunes App Store.
