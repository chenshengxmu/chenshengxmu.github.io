* Google on Wednesday released a free Trusted Contacts app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch following its release on Android in December of last year.
* The software includes Find My Friends-like capabilities that allow you to locate friends and family on a map and let others know that you’re safe.
* Unlike Find My Friends, Trusted Contacts comes with a handy timeout feature and is cross-platform so both iOS and Android customers can download and use it for location sharing.
* According to Google, the app makes it easy for your trusted contacts to request your location even if your device is offline or you can’t get to it.
* It integrates with Google Maps location sharing, allowing you to easily enable permanent location sharing with selected contacts and find them directly within Google Maps.
* Trusted contacts can be added by phone number or email address. Anyone who accepts your request becomes a trusted contact and you’ll see their name and profile picture in the app.
* You can also proactively share your location in emergency situations to let your friends and family know you’re safe. As I mentioned before, Trusted Contacts lets you specify how long to wait before your location is automatically shared with a trusted contact who asks for it.
* For example, you can choose to share your location immediately or wait up to an hour.
* It will automatically share your location if you don’t respond to the request within a preset time. This is great for emergency situations because this option works even if you’re offline or your phone is out of battery.
* Download Trusted Contacts for iOS from App Store for free.
