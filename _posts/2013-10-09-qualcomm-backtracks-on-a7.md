* Last week, Qualcomm’s CMO Anand Chandrasekher made headlines for comments he made during an interview regarding Apple’s new A7 processor. He called the chip a ‘marketing gimmick,’ and said 64-bit holds no real benefit for users.
* But pundits were quick to challenge Chandrasekher, pointing to apps and games with A7 support as proof that the 64-bit architecture holds value. And Qualcomm must agree, because it has issued a statement backtracking on the claims…
* TechHive has the scoop:
* “The comments made by Anand Chandrasekher, Qualcomm CMO, about 64-bit computing were inaccurate,” said a Qualcomm spokesperson in an email. “The mobile hardware and software ecosystem is already moving in the direction of 64-bit; and, the evolution to 64-bit brings desktop class capabilities and user experiences to mobile, as well as enabling mobile processors and software to run new classes of computing devices.”
* Qualcomm did not provide further comment.”
* And for reference, here’s Chandrasekher from last week:
* “I know there’s a lot of noise because Apple did [64-bit] on their A7,” said Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Qualcomm, in an interview. “I think they are doing a marketing gimmick. There’s zero benefit a consumer gets from that.”
* It’s not surprising that Qualcomm is pulling back here. Not only is this a PR move—removing the company’s name from a controversial subject—but the company also has a close relationship with Apple, as it makes iPhone and iPad modems.

* And despite Chandrasekher comments, Qualcomm itself is working on a 64-bit processor, which Android smartphones are expected to start utilizing in 2014. So this is definitely where the market is headed, it’s just that Apple got there early.
