* Google yesterday bumped its Gboard software keyboard for iPhone and iPad to version 1.29, bringing out Morse code typing as well as Dvorak and Colemak layouts for English keyboards.
* Google partnered with developer Tania Finlayson, who is an expert in Morse code assistive technology, to implement Morse code typing on Gboard for iOS.
* When Morse code typing is enabled in the Gboard app, the standard keyboard layout gets tweaked quite a bit. The Morse code dot and dash keys replace the letters and Gboard even suggests words above the keyboard along with their Morse code sequences.
* The same feature debuted in Gboard for Android a while ago.
* If you wonder how to communicate in Morse code, Google has kindly created a Morse Typing Trainer game that runs in a web browser at morse.withgoogle.com/learn/.
* Gboard is a free download from App Store.
