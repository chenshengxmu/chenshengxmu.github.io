* The iPhone-connected wristwatch has been the unicorn of iOS accessories for the past few years. Folks have been asking for one, but manufacturers have yet to produce one that appeals to the masses. Then came the Pebble.
* MacStories points to a brilliant Kickstarter project for a smartphone-connected wristwatch known as the Pebble. It’s developed by the same folks who made the InPulse Smart Watch, and is packed full of features…
* Pebble is a customizable wristwatch that connects to your iPhone or Android device via bluetooth. As of right now, it can pull data like caller ID, email, calendar alerts, Facebook messages, and Twitter notifications from the handset. But using the SDK, third party developers will be able to add all kinds of different functions.
* And the watch’s features don’t end there. It also has an e-paper display — viewable in direct sunlight, a built-in accelerometer, and a battery that will last you a staggering 7 days. The Pebble comes in arctic white, jet black, cherry red, and a mystery color to be decided on by Kickstarter backers.
* At the time of this writing, the Pebble project had already received $388,000 of its $100,000 goal. So it’s for sure getting funded. But for those of you who are interested in the watch, a pledge of $99 scores you a jet black Pebble — which is about $50 less than it will cost you when it hits retail stores this fall.
* What do you think of the Pebble?
