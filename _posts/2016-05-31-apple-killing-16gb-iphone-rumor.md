* Apple could be finally ditching the oft-criticized sixteen-gigabyte iPhone from the mix and replace it with a thirty-two gigabyte SKU as the new baseline model. That’s if you believe what an IHS Technology analyst posted on Chinese social media this morning, as per 9to5Mac.
* Based on IHS’s supply chain research, the analysts wrote that the iPhone 7 would come outfitted with 32 gigabytes of storage as the new $199 base model. IHS correctly predicted that a four-inch iPhone refresh would be introduced in 2016.
* The analyst also said that the iPhone 7 would feature two gigabytes of RAM without specifying whether or not the flagship iPhone 7 Plus model would include three gigabytes of RAM, as KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo predicted.
* Japanese newspaper Nikkei made an interesting claim today, saying that Apple would switch from a tick-tock cycle of refreshing the iPhone every two years to a three-year cycle, due to slowing smartphone market and innovation.
