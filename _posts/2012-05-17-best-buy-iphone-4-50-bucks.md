* It’s pretty obvious that we love our iPhones here at iDB. But we understand the handset can be a bit pricey. So we do our best to try and pass along any deals we find regarding the device.
* The latest sale we’ve come across belongs to Best Buy. The international retail chain is currently offering the iPhone 4, on AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, for just $49.99 with a contract…
* The promotion matches the prices that we were already seeing from Target and RadioShack. And, as with these retailers, the offer appears to only be available via in-store purchases.
* Sure, the iPhone 4 is nearly two years old. And to get the sale price, you have to sign a two-year contract with a carrier. But it’s still a much better choice than some of the other sub-$100 handsets out there.
* Plus, look at the bright side. Since there’s a bootrom exploit for the A4, you won’t ever have to worry about not being able to jailbreak it. Just a thought.
