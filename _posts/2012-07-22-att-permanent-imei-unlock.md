* Apple N Berry is an online parts vendor that also deals in iPhone unlock solutions. We actually point to the store quite often when mentioning GEVEY Ultra products — they usually have them.
* But now it’s offering something much different than interposers. The vendor has just launched a new IMEI unlock service that, it promises, will permanently unlock all AT&T iPhone models…
* From the site’s description:
* “Apple N Berry iPhone IMEI unlock is a permanent iPhone unlock solution. Once unlocked, your iPhone will remain unlocked even after an iOS upgrade or SIM card swap. IMEI unlocks are considered an iPhone factory unlock that works with any AT&T iPhone model 3G, 3GS, 4, and 4S regardless of baseband.”
* As you can imagine, this doesn’t come cheap. Apple N Berry is charging $150 for its IMEI Unlock. And it requires you to hand over your handset’s IMEI and serial number.
* Should you order it, the vendor says that the unlock can take from 1-2 business days. You’ll receive an email once it’s complete, and you can verify it worked by syncing your iPhone with iTunes.
* While all of this sounds great, there’s a few things worth noting. First off, remember that AT&T will unlock your iPhone for free if it’s out of contract. So if you’ve had yours for close to two years, you should try that route first.
* Second, we have not confirmed the legitimacy of this service, and have no idea if it works or not. Apple N Berry is fairly well known in the unlock community, and this sounds a lot like the credible CutYourSim service, but you should always approach things like this with a certain level of caution.
* We’ll let you know once we can verify that this works as advertised. But in the meantime, if you happen to try it, let us know about your experience below.
