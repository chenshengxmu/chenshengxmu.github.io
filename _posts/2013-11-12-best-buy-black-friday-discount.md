* Following Black Friday sale previews from Target and Walmart, major electronics retailer Best Buy has published a number of deals it will be offering up on the popular after-Thanksgiving-day shopping weekend.
* Folks looking to get an iPad for a friend or family member for the holidays will be interested to hear that Best Buy will be selling the iPad 2 for $299—$100 off. And it will also be discounting Macs, iPods and more…
* Looking at the ad, Best Buy says that it will be offering both white and black models of the 16GB Wi-Fi-only iPad 2 for $299. Sure, it’s two years-old, but it’s essentially the same price as the iPad mini with a larger screen.
