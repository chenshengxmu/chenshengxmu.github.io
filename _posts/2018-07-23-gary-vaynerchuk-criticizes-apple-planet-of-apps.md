* I thought “Planet of the Apps” was quite an interesting show because it let the public in on how apps are bootstrapped, funded and marketed, but I realize I’m in the minority. One of the “Planet of the Apps” stars has attributed the show’s failure to Apple’s bad marketing.
* In “Planet of the Apps,” developers pitch ideas to mentors Jessica Alba, Will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow and Gary Vaynerchuk in the hope of earning millions of dollars in capital funding.
* According to a recent episode on Vaynerchuk’s podcast, via BusinessInsider, “Apple did everything wrong” in terms of spreading the word about its show about apps and their makers.
* I was on Apple’s show ‘Planet of the Apps,’ Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.i.am, Jessica Alba and me. And Apple didn’t use me or Vayner to do the marketing, and did everything wrong.
* For all my bravado, I’m a real tough guy when it’s in my home, this is my home and every time I do content, it’s my home. But when I’m at someone else’s house, I was taught to show respect.
* You’d be blown away by the way I handled myself in the Apple marketing meetings.
* Vaynerchuk went on to explain that he forces himself to remain mostly mum during marketing meetings at Apple because it was their project, not his. Apple also failed to exploit the marketing talent of one Jimmy Iovine, the famed record producer turned entrepreneur who co-founded Beats and sold it to Apple for more than $3 billion dollars, he added.
* My cheeks were bleeding profusely out of every meeting, because I was biting them, my tongue completely fell out of my mouth. You’re also there with Jimmy Iovine, Jimmy’s like, ‘I got it, we got it, we got it.’ And I knew he wasn’t in the trenches.
* I know Jimmy’s no dope, clearly. But I was like, ‘f*** this.’
* Will’s the best at music and Jess is a gangster entrepreneur and Gwyneth is like an all-time actress, there’s talent out there, but in the f* business show, that was my f* domain,” Vaynerchuk said.
* And here’s that segment (mark 26:00).
* We’d normally dismiss this as hear-say.
* That being said, Vaynerchuk is not just some random celebrity commenting on something they know nothing about. 42 years old, this Belarusian-American is best known to the general public as a colorful Internet personality, but there’s more to him than meets the eye.
* Little do people know that Vaynerchuk is also a successful entrepreneur, author and speaker, as well as an angel investor and a wine specialist. He is widely known for his work in digital marketing and social media, leading New York-based companies VaynerMedia and VaynerX.
* Would you agree with his assessment that bad marketing led to the show’s undoing?
