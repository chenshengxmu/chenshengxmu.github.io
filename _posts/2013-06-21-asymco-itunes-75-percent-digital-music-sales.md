* Apple’s iTunes is one of those happy ironies. Begun as a way to boost sales of Macs and other hardware and content with breaking even, the service now rakes in $20 billion per year selling digital warez such as video, books, apps and music – a whole lot of music. In fact, Apple now sells 75 percent of all digital music, according to a new analysis.
* In a series of peeks into how iTunes earns all that revenue, independent analyst Horace Dediu paints a picture where more than a half-billion users are pointing to a future where apps surpass digital music sales…
* When Apple announced Thursday the addition of HBO and ESPN to its Apple TV lineup, the usually tight-lipped firm provided a detailed picture of what’s selling on iTunes. The highlight: Apple controls $6.9 billion of the $9.3 billion spent annually on digital music, Dediu pointed out.
* While this explains why music labels want an Apple competitor in this sector, another number shows why Apple wants its own streaming music business.
* According to the analyst, each of the 575 million iTunes users spend $2 per year on books, $4 per year on video, $9 per year on software, $12 per year on music and $16 per year on apps.
* Focus on those last two numbers.
* In 2007, iTunes users were spending triple what they do on digital music.
* On average, iTunes is adding 500,000 new accounts each day. Source: Asymco.

* Likewise, apps have increasingly become a larger revenue-generator for Apple.
* Why is per-user iTunes purchases of digital music falling?
* While in the beginning, anyone wanting digital music had to go to iTunes (remember all the failed attempts to compete?), now there are several streaming-music options, where you can listen to tunes without having to buy an album from Apple.
* This explains why the iPod maker is so hot on the idea of introducing its own streaming-music service, iRadio, later this year.
* Can Apple prevent the escape of more digital music revenue, or is the spending shift towards apps a done deal?
* Whatever the outcome, iTunes will never return to its roots as just a way to sell more hardware – it is now a massive high-revenue, low-margin business on its own.
