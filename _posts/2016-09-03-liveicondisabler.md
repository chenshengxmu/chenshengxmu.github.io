* Starting with iOS 7, Apple officially brought animated hour, minute, and second hands to the Clock app’s icon that reflect upon the actual time.
* Whether or not you like these animations, a new free jailbreak tweak release called LiveIconDisabler now gives you the power to disable them.
* Personally, I kind of like these animations; and I always have. I remember when I used to install a tweak made by Ryan Petrich back in the day that actually forced the Clock app icon to animate, but it was no longer necessary after Apple officially implemented it.
* It was the aesthetic of having a moving analog clock on my boring Home screen that I liked. I thought it looked good and it was fun to look at when I wanted to watch the seconds go by. After all, the Status Bar’s digital clock never supported seconds out of the box, so you had to jailbreak to have that too.
* Well, for those who disagree, this tweak will disable the animations for the Clock app icon. Just to be clear, it won’t affect the Calendar app, which updates the date on the icon on a daily basis.
* The developer of LiveIconDisabler claims the tweak will save battery life by reducing the amount of GPU usage you’d normally be using from having an animated Clock app icon, but I have a hard time believing it’s going to be anything significant.
* As far as power usage is concerned, that claim is probably a load of fluff, but for anyone who doesn’t like having unnecessary animations on the Home screen, this tweak could be worth looking into.
* LiveIconDisabler doesn’t have any options to configure; after installation, it goes to work immediately. If you want to give it a try on your jailbroken iOS 9 device(s), you can download it for free today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
