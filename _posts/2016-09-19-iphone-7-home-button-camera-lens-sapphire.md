* I’ve seen a few reports on the web claiming that the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus do not use sapphire crystal to protect the Touch ID sensor on the non-moving Home button and the camera lens. It would make sense for everybody to stop worrying because these reports are simply not true.
* According to Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller on Twitter, both new iPhone models use sapphire protection for the Home button and camera lens, just like before.
* Apple’s official iPhone 7 Tech Specs webpage also mentions sapphire crystal lens cover for the rear camera(s) so there’s that.
* @Lunnzies Not true. Camera lens cover and top of Home Button both Sapphire. #iPhone7

* In another tweet, Schiller fielded a question from a customer who asked why the wide lens on the iPhone 7 Plus sometimes takes 2x pictures rather then use a dedicated telephoto lens with true 2x optical zoom, as evidenced by the EXIF data from a 2x picture saying it’s digital zoom.
* That’s because, Schiller said, the new dual camera system may decided to use the wide angle 28mm f/1.8 lens in certain situations like low-light scenarios or when taking a 10cm macro shot. In such situations, using the wide angle lens with optical image stabilization results in “the best photo” as the telephoto lens lacks OIS.
* A non scientific torture test conducted by JerryRigEverything, seen above, has determined that the iPhone 7 body scratched at Level 6 on the Moh scale of hardness, keeping it at par with several other handsets.
* However, the sapphire-protected Home button and camera lens also scratched to Level 6 although sapphire can sustain scratches up to Level 9. One possible explanation: Apple could be using a sapphire/glass hybrid rather than 100 percent sapphire crystal.
* Still, that doesn’t account for a low Level 6 score.
* Some people think it was the coating that scratched, not the actual sapphire material, while others caution that any tests showing the camera lens cover scratched at Level 6 are probably fake or, at the very least, unprofessionally conducted.
* Thoughts?
