* According to a research note that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent to clients this morning, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, Apple’s rumored four-inch iPhone refresh will be released in early-2016, possibly in time for the spring.
* It will feature an iPhone 5s-like exterior design with an iPhone 6s-like display that’s curved at the edges.
* The device apparently sports a colorful metal chassis, runs the A9 system-on-a-chip manufactured by both TSMC and Samsung (which also powers the latest iPhone 6s series) and includes NFC to support Apple Pay transactions.
* The handset, which could be marketed as ‘iPhone 6c,’ will have identical camera specifications to the current entry-level iPhone and should cost between $400 and $500 off-contract in the United States, or $149-$249 less than the contract-free 16GB iPhone 6s, the analyst predicted.
* Apple will offer that device in two or three casing colors, Kuo said. It will not include 3D Touch, an iPhone 6s-exclusive feature. He did not say whether or not the iPhone 6c might include Touch ID.
* The fairly reliable Japanese blog Macotakara recently quoted sources as saying that the forthcoming phone will run the previous-generation A8 chip found inside last year’s iPhone 6 series, not the latest A9 processor. Other analyst are also expecting a new four-inch iPhone model in 2016.
* The device should ship around the March-April timeframe, with shipments for the calendar year expected to reach 20 million units, accounting for about 8 to 9 percent of total iPhone sales.
