* I’m a huge sucker for awesome weather apps, so much that I’m afraid to even think about how much money I’ve put into these kinds of apps for my iThings.
* Yahoo, as you know, supplies Apple with weather data for its stock iOS Weather app (in addition to Stocks and Siri data as well) and it was reported earlier this morning that the company will be launching a dedicated weather forecast software on the App Store.
* You could imagine a weather buff like myself would be hanging on the edge of my seat in anticipation of Yahoo! Weather. Now that it’s just hit the App Store, I can honestly say that this is the best-designed iOS app from Yahoo yet.
* The elegant typography combined with the big, beautiful full-screen images (crowd-sourced via Flickr), the crisp weather pictograms and just the right amount of information make this my new favorite weather forecast app. Jump past the fold for a bunch of screenshots, you know you want to..
* The app makes clever use of standard gestures to its advantage.
* For example, to access your favorite locations, simply swipe horizontally. To dive deeper into detailed weather information for any particular location, just swipe vertically.
* Check out more screenshots below and dare tell me this isn’t one of the most elegant weather apps on the iPhone.

* From release notes:
* The forecast is beautiful. See the weather like never before – only Yahoo! Weather combines stunning photos with the most accurate forecasts.
* In addition to an at-a-glance simplified overview of your weather forecast, the application won’t disappoint an armchair weather forecaster inside you as it also incorporates interactive radar, satellite, heat and wind maps and sunrise/sunset times.

* Even these advanced features are carefully designed not to clutter the interface and intimidate users. What’s best, you can also submit your own photos to the app at Project Weather on Flickr.

* Yahoo! Weather is a free download for the iPhone and iPod touch.
* Can’t wait to see what Yahoo! does with this app on the iPad’s larger canvas!
