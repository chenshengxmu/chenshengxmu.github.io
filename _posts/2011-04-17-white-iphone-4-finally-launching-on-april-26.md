* It appears that Apple is planning on releasing the white iPhone 4 in exactly ten days. Several recent reports have confirmed a “Springtime” launch, and April 26 looks to be the lucky day.
* According to iPhoneItalia, Apple will finally release the white iPhone 4 next week.
* “iPhone white arrival, date of arrival in the stores H3G April 26. the product code is already open …. The news is almost certain though not announced.”
* We already knew that the white iPhone was coming soon, and Apple has yet to give official word on the date. If iPhoneItalia’s sources are correct, we’ll be seeing the device next Tuesday.
* It looks like the white iPhone will just show up on Apple.com. Apple probably doesn’t want to risk embarrassment by drawing more attention to the product’s 10 month delay.
* It’a almost here, folks. Will you be getting one?
