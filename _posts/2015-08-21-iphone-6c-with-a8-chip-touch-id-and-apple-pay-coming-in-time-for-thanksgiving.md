* Apple’s rumored ‘iPhone 6c’ boasting an in-house designed ‘A8’ processor, a four-inch Retina screen, Touch ID fingerprint scanning and Apple Pay mobile payments could be with you in time for Thanksgiving, according to latest reports from Apple’s supply chain.
* Assuming the reports are true, the mythical device will pose a significant jump in terms of hardware versus the iPhone 5c, which runs the iPhone 5’s three-year old A6 processor and has no biometric authentication or NFC.
* Chinese-language newspaper Commercial Times reports that Apple’s partner Foxconn forbade its employees in the Zhengzhou plant from having day-offs one week before the next iPhone’s launch in September.
* Foxconn apparently received “large orders” for the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and the iPhone 6c. Sources previously said the device will ditch its unapologetically plastic enclosure for an all-metal enclosure with iPhone 6 style design.

* According to DigiTimes Research, the iPhone 6c will feature a four-inch display like its predecessor, run a faster A8 processor and incorporate NFC for Apple Pay and Touch ID for biometric authentication. If I were a betting man, I’d say it’d run Apple’s M8 motion co-processor, too.
* Apple is rumored to hold a media event on Wednesday, September 9 to unveil new iPhones, iPads and a next-generation Apple TV, but the company has yet to send out invites to the media. Because the iPhone 6c is said to arrive two months later in November, Apple may not formally announce the handset at next month’s event and could instead opt to launch the device with a quiet website update and a simple press release.
