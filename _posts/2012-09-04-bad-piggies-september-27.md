* Two months ago, we learned that Finnish developer Rovio is working on a new Angry Birds pig game said to be focused on the piggies and slated for release just in time for the pre-holiday rush. Then last week, Rovio posted a teaser that offered a few glimpses into the upcoming game that turns the formula on its head by challenging you to to protect the eggs you’ve grabbed from the birds. Today, Rovio released a few more details and confirmed that Bad Piggies (that’s the official title) will be released for iOS, Android and the Mac on September 27…
* According to a post over at the Rovio blog, the new game will launch on iOS, Android and Mac on September 27 whereas Windows Phone, Windows 8 and PC versions will follow shortly.
* Rovio CEO Mikael Hed explains:
* There’s a lot of empathy towards the lovable enemies from the Angry Birds games, and we’ve been constantly asked: what about the pigs’ side of the story? Bad Piggies gives you the chance to play as the second-most-loved characters in the Angry Birds universe, and explore this rich world through their green eyes.
* Even with the reversed formula, you needn’t worry as the catapults plus wooden and stone structures still play a pivotal role in the game’s mechanics.
* Here’s your teaser.
* They’ve also set up a dedicated website at badpiggies.com as well as the official Facebook and Twitter accounts pertaining to the game (don’t forget to fan iDB on Facebook, if you haven’t already).

* I’m guessing you’ve pretty much grown tired of the usual Angry Birds formula and that the ability to play from the pigs’ perspective could make you fall in love with the series all over again, no?
