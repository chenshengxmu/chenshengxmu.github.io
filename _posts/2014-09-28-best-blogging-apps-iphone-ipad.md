* If you participate in the digital information age through blogging, then you know how difficult it is to keep up with your daily posts. Whether you are just too busy, or don’t want to sit in front of your computer after your workday is over, writing and publishing can be a daunting task.
* There are a handful of excellent mobile apps that make it easier to stay active in the blogosphere while on the go. We’ve got a list of what we think are the best blogging apps for the iPhone and iPad for you today.

* Probably the most popular blogging site for the tech industry is WordPress. This official app makes it possible for you to manage your posts on the go. You can create and edit posts and pages, upload pictures and videos, moderate comments, and view your website’s stats. When you are finished polishing your daily masterpiece, you can publish it right on your iPhone. You can also keep track of blogs you follow in your personal feed. Find new WordPress users to follow and keep track of their posts, as well. This app is available for free.

* Maybe you’re not as prolific as a writer, but love to share your favorite photos and videos from around the Web. Tumblr is perfect for shorter posts with lots of visual content. It’s like the magazine of the blogging world. This official app gives you the ability to share content, including photos, videos, quotes, and more. Create and edit a post right from your iPhone or iPad and publish when you are ready. You can check your messages and reply to them, repost other content, and “like” posts, even offline. With iOS 8, you can now post pictures and videos using app extensions. This app is available for free.

* Squarespace is a lesser-known, but incredibly beautiful web-building platform that allows users to craft elegant websites. This official app gives you complete access to editing and managing your Squarespace content from multiple accounts. You can create and edit posts using the company’s Layout Engine, add photos, format text, and create links while on the go. Keep track of comments and reply to readers with little effort. You can even mark a comment as spam “with a flick of your finger.” Instead of logging in and out of different pages, this app allows you to toggle between websites seamlessly. This app is available for free.

* The key to a seamless browsing experience is the ability to have multiple tabs open at the same time. This app was specifically designed to create a new tab every time you tap on a link in Tumblr. In order to save space on your screen, the controls will slip out of sight when you scroll down on a post. You can view your feed in both landscape and portrait mode and switch between either the flow or grid layout. You can post any type of content, including photos, videos, chats, links, text, and quotes whether you are on or offline. This app is available for free.

* Whether you use Blogger or WordPress, or even both, this iPad app helps you create and publish great content from anywhere. If you manage multiple blogs, you’ll have easy access to all of them and be able to check on everything at a glance. Browse your content by date by checking the built-in calendar. Create, edit, and publish content, including image layout and video uploads. Receive notifications when someone comments and then edit and respond from within the app. Work offline, including creating and editing new and previously published posts. All work will be saved in the “outbox” and published when you are back online. This app is available on the iPad for free.

* Personally, I’ve got two WordPress blogs, a Blogger account, and a Tumblr page. It is much easier for me to work in a third-party app that allows for multiple types of blogs. This one lets you access the above-mentioned blogs, plus Squarespace, TypePad, LiveJournal, and more. It is also closely integrated with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Picasa so you can share your posts with friends and family with a single tap. You can create and edit posts with both text and images, add tags and labels, schedule a publishing date and tie, and more. Include emoji icons and customized signatures. In Blogger and WordPress, you can manage comments. This app is available for $2.99.

* This robust app is designed specifically for the iPad to allow users full access to a wide variety of blogging accounts, such as WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, Squarespace, and more. Plus, manage your Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, and Facebook accounts right from the main page. Use the drag-and-drop feature to add photos and videos from your social networking sites into your blog posts. Create links from websites with one touch. Use gestures for such adjustments as bold print and text alignment. Create and edit posts and schedule them for publication while on the go. This app is available on the iPad for $4.99.

* In recent years, blogging has taken on a whole new meaning. Many people consider posting to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more, to be part of the “micro-blogging” world. If you are a mini content creator, HootSuite is a great way to manage your various social networking sites. The app gives you access to account, giving you control over when and how you share content. Create and schedule publication to various sites over different dates and times. Keep track of messages, “likes” and comments. Plus, you can monitor and track click-through stats from wherever you are. In iOS 8, use app extensions to share content from any app. This app is available for free.
