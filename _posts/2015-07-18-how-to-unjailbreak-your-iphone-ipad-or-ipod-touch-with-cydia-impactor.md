* Want to remove your jailbreak without updating iOS? The just released Cydia Impactor can help you unjailbreak your iPhone with little effort. In this video tutorial, I’ll show you how to revert back to stock iOS and remove your jailbreak without updating your iOS version.
* Note: This tool is in beta for iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4, so your mileage may vary. Be sure to backup your device, as this will delete all settings, apps, and contents. It will remove all jailbreak related stuff and “unjailbreak” your iPhone. You will still remain on the same firmware, but all of your data will be wiped. Proceed with caution.
* Also, I should mention that Cydia Impactor will not work with the 6th generation iPod touch, since there are no OTAs for that device.
* Step 1: Backup your iOS device using iCloud or iTunes
* Step 2: Make sure that you device is plugged in, and has at least 20% battery life
* Step 3: Install Cydia Impactor from Cydia
* Step 4: Run Cydia Impactor by tapping delete all data and unjailbreak device, then tap the Delete All button to confirm. Once the process begins, be sure not to touch your device until you see the iOS setup welcome screen
* Step 5: Once completed and at the welcome screen, go back through the initial iOS setup process and activation
* That’s it. You will now have a stock iPhone on your current firmware. If you want to reestablish your jailbreak, just use the same jailbreak tool that you used to jailbreak before. You can also choose to restore your backup during the iOS setup process.
* What do you think? Are you excited to have this new firmware preservation tool?
