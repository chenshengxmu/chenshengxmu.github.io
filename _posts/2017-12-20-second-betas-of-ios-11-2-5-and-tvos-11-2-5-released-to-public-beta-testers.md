* Apple on Wednesday rolled out second betas of iOS 11.2.5 and tvOS 11.2.5 to its public beta testers.
* The latest public betas are identical to the beta provided to developers yesterday.
* Second public betas of iOS 11.25 and tvOS 11.2.5 arrived six days following their first public betas and seven days after Apple seeded first betas of iOS 11.2.5 and tvOS 11.2.5 to its registered developers and members of the paid Apple Developer Program.
* If you’ve signed up for Apple Beta Software Program at beta.apple.com and have enrolled your iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, you can download the new betas via the Software Update mechanism (your devices must have a proper Apple certificate).
* On your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings → General → Software Update to install  the public beta.
* As for your Apple TV, after enrolling your set-top box at the Apple Beta Software Program website, go to Settings → System → Software Updates on the device and enable the option Get Public Beta Updates before checking for new software updates.
* iOS 11.2.5 and tvOS 11.2.5 are bug-fix updates with no new features.
* Are you planning on testing Apple’s new public betas?
* Let us know in the comments section!
