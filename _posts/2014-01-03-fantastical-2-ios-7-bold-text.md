* Fantastical, Flexibits’ popular calendar and to-do application for the iPhone and Mac, received its mandatory iOS 7 refresh two months ago. Though a separate purchase (currently 60 percent off: only $1.99 for a limited time), Fantastical 2 justifies its asking price by managing to build upon the already strong feature set of the original release with its nicely redone interface and a host of new capabilities that help take the way you create, edit and view calendar events on iOS and OS X to the next level.
* In today’s quick refresh, Fantastical version 2.0.4 brings out support for Bold Text accessibility option in iOS 7, along with improved reliability of the app icon badge, a pair of UI and navigation tweaks and mandatory fixes and under-the-hood improvements…
* Vision impaired users and people who squint at small screens due to astigmatism like yours truly will appreciate newly implemented support for Bold Text, an accessibility feature Apple introduced in iOS 7.
* Assuming you’ve set the Bold Text switch to ON in your iOS Settings > General > Accessibility (requires respringing), Fantastical will replace default Helvetica Neue typeface with its bold counterpart, thereby improving legibility.
* If you type ‘task’ or ‘todo’ when creating a new item, Fantastical 2.0.4 will now keep auto-capitalization enabled. Another much welcomed betterment: tapping and holding any back button will now take you straight to the top view.
* Past two Fantastical updates have added sound for notifications, improved geofencing and new app icon badge options, to name a few. For instance, you can now tell it to display All Overdue Reminders  (the same behavior as Apple’s Reminders app) in the app icon’s badge.
* Sometimes that feature wouldn’t work as expected, but today’s update fixes this hiccup with improved reliability of the app icon badge.
* Fantastical 2.0.4 is currently available in the App Store for just $1.99.
* The productivity app normally costs $3.99 a pop, but Flexibits is currently offering it with a 60 percent discount for a limited time, so you better hurry if you’ve been on the lookout for a deal like this because the price could go back up at any moment.
* Did I mention that Fantastical 2 for Mac is on sale as well? It’s just $9.99 (normally $19.99) in the Mac App Store, so you’re looking at a cool ten bucks saved right off the bat.
