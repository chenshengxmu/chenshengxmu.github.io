* Joy of Tech does regular takes on the tech industry’s blunders and Apple is often the subject of their daily web comic. This is their view of Monday’s executive shake-up that saw CEO Tim Cook fire long-time iOS chief Scott Forstall and retail boss (though he never earned that title) John Browett. Go past the fold for the comic and an additional explanation…
* Here’s your comic, courtesy of Joy of Tech.

* Now, Apple immediately pulled Scott’s profile from its Executive Profiles page, but if you ask Siri about Forstall, she still doesn’t have a clue he was let go, per Cult of Mac.
* Uncle Eddy will hopefully see to that.
* In case you’ve been wondering, the top image of the Overly Attached Forstall is credited to Christopher Downer, interface designer at Realmac Software.
* Who’s Craig?
* Craig Federighi, the chief of the Mac software division, now also in charge of iOS.
* He’s got some pretty big shoes to fill, if you ask me.
* Anyway, feel free to post your funny take down in the comment.
