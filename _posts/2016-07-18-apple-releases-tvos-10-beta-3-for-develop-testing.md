* In addition to releasing a third beta of iOS 10 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to members of the Apple Developer Program, Apple on Monday morning also released a third beta of tvOS 10 for developer testing. tvOS 10 beta 3 (build “14T5296d”) can be deployed on fourth-generation Apple TVs that have an appropriate configuration profile installed and are running a prior beta of tvOS 10.
* tvOS 10 beta 3 arrives 13 days following beta 2, which released for developer testing on July 5, and a little more than a month ago following the original developer preview of the upcoming Apple TV operating system revision, that release following the June 13 WWDC keynote.
* Although both iOS 10 and macOS Sierra are now available to public beta testers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program, tvOS and watchOS builds are not yet part of the program.
* tvOS 10 brings a few improvements to the Apple TV operating system, including a new Dark Mode, Single Sign-On for pay-TV apps, expanded Siri features with native YouTube voice search, a redesigned Remote app with Siri and tilt gaming support, Automatic Downloads for Apple TV apps, prompts to download companion apps for Bluetooth accessories, Live Tune-In, among other changes.
* tvOS 10 will also support a number of developer features that enhance what the apps can do, like support for four ‘Made for iOS’ controllers. In addition, Apple TV games are no longer required to support the Siri Remote.
* We’ll update this post with any changes found in tvOS 10 beta 3 as we encounter them. You can contribute to the article by posting your own new feature findings in the comments below.
