* We’ve already seen alleged 1,810mAh, 2,100mAh, and 2,915mAh batteries bound for Apple’s upcoming handsets and now the strongest 2,915mAh module has been showed off on a set of new photos posted Tuesday morning by the French publication NowhereElse.fr [Google Translate].
* Featuring a capacity of 2,915mAh versus the iPhone 5s’s 1,560mAh package, this prototype battery should theoretically allow the iPhone 6 to last longer on a single charge and get your through the day without recharging.
* On the other hand, it’s entirely possible that Apple will advertise the iPhone 6 as having the same battery life as the iPhone 5s. That’s because an increase in the battery capacity could be offset by a bigger screen which draws more power. Same could be said for other rumored new components such as an NXP-made NFC chip for mobile payments, faster graphics and more.
* The photographed unit bears a manufacturing date of March 2014. The markings indicate it was manufactured by Chinese firm Desay Battery. A July report by Taiwan’s United Daily News identified Desay Battery as a battery supplier for upcoming iPads.
* The China-based firm currently supplies iPhone batteries and is rumored to have won contracts for the iPhone 6 lineup.
* According to sourced who spoke to iGen recently, the battery in the 5.5-inch device should be over 2,915 mAh, or almost twice the size of the iPhone 5s’s 1,560mAh battery.
* If true, then the 4.7-inch variant should be outfitted with a 2,915 or 1,810mAh battery. At any rate, Apple should be wise to finally address the iPhone battery complaints, even more so given Samsung’s aggressive ‘Wall Huggers’ marketing campaign and the fact that flagship Android devices feature 3,000+ mAh batteries.

* Yesterday, NowhereElse published a video showing off a rear shell of a 5.5-inch iPhone 6 variant. Moreover, the blog has learned from sources that Apple will market the bigger iPhone under the ‘iPhone Air,’ which was first used for iOS devices with the release of the iPad Air last September.
* Apple last week issued invites for a media event set to take place next Tuesday, September 9, at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Apple’s hometown of Cupertino, strongly hinting at the importance of the upcoming announcements.
