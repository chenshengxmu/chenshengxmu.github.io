* Let’s be honest, how many of you actually rely on the little dots above your iPhone’s dock to gather your whereabouts while swiping between pages?
* If you’re like me and happen to find yourself rarely relying on those dots, all the while preferring a more minimalistic look to your iPhone, then chpwn’s latest tweak, aptly entitled No Page Dots, is for you.
* I’m usually not one who’s very high on visual tweaks for my iPhone; generally speaking, I like to keep it looking as close to stock as possible. Fortunately, No Page Dots is a tweak so subtle that it doesn’t alter your iPhone’s home screen visually enough to stand out as a glaring omission, as say, removing the app labels would.
* So should you or shouldn’t you? The tweak is almost to the point where it’s completely unnoticeable, but there’s still just enough of a change to make your home screen slightly cleaner.
* If you’re an undercover minimalist, that is, if you like minimalism without straying too far from home, then No Page Dots may be for you. Besides, the tweak is free for jailbroken iPhones, so why not hop over to Cydia, give it a try, and tell us what you think?
