* I’ve always thought that Siri looked good, just not as great as Apple would want you to believe. I was a skeptic. I was a skeptic until about an hour ago when I first tried Siri for myself.
* It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely better than any other voice recognition/control/A.I. you’ve ever used. It integrates commendably with the iPhone 4S, and best of all, it just works…most of the time.
* Siri will, without a doubt, change the way we communicate with our devices going forward; it’s like the missing link that we’ve needed all along.
* Check inside and see what it’s like to have small talk with Siri…
* Needless to say, I’m throughly impressed with Siri, and I firmly believe if you try it, you will be just as convinced.
* It’s one of those things that you just have to use in action to fully appreciate.
* If you’ve given Siri a spin, by all means, share your thoughts about Apple’s new voice service. Do you believe it’s all it’s cracked up to be?
