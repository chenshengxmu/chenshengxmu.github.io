* Among the big announcements that were expected is some improvements to FaceTime. During today’s WWDC event, Apple senior vice president of iOS Software Scott Forstall announced that FaceTime will finally allow for calls over cellular network.
* That means you are no more tied to your wifi network to have a FaceTime conversation with someone…
* FaceTime now works over cellular networks as well as Wi-Fi, so you can make and receive FaceTime calls wherever you happen to be. You can even make and receive FaceTime calls on your iPad using your phone number. That means you can use FaceTime wherever you are, on any device. And never miss another wink, smile, air kiss, or eye roll.
* On top of that, Apple is now launching a unified phone number and Apple ID, which means that if someone starts a FaceTime call using your phone number, your iPad will be able to be rang as well.
