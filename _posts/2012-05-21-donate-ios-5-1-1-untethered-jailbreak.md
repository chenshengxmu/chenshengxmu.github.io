* Let’s be real. The folks behind such projects as the upcoming iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak put in some major work, and aren’t compensated beyond what they receive in donations.
* In the various posts that we’ve created on the subject of the upcoming jailbreak, we’ve seen a host of generous comments asking where and how to donate.
* MuscleNerd recently revealed some additional information about the upcoming iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak, and with it, he included a link that appreciative people could use to donate.
* The link was in the prior post, but it kind of got buried along with the other information. For that reason we thought a dedicated post was warranted highlighting the opportunity to donate to the team as a means to compensate for their time and effort.
* To donate, simply visit the following PayPal link.
* This link has been setup to support those involved directly with the iOS 5.1.1 Jailbreak, which obviously includes pod2g, and members of both the Chronic Dev Team and the iPhone Dev Team. If you’d prefer to use the link directly from MuscleNerd’s post, you can view his tweet here.

* Obviously donations aren’t compulsory, but if you feel that their hard work should be compensated, then feel free to let them know how much you appreciate their work over the past months.
