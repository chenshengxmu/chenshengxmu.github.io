* It’s been more than two years since Google unveiled its Music service, and the company has yet to launch an official iOS client. Sure, there’s been plenty of third-party apps, and a web app, but nothing native directly from Google.
* But according to a new report from Engadget, that could change very soon. Citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, the outlet claims that Google is testing a Music app internally, and plans to launch it later this month…
* Engadget’s Matt Brian reports:
* “Sources aware of Google’s plans have let slip to Engadget that not only is the company currently testing a native Google Music iOS app internally, but that it’ll launch later this month. We’re told that while employees have been invited to test the app, Google still needs to fix a few bugs before it’s ready for release.”
* The new app is said to be much more capable than the current web client available to iOS users, with Google reportedly including many of the same custom radio and smart recommendation features that are found in the Android app.
* It will also work with Google Play Music All Access, a Spotify-competitor that launched in May of this year. The service offers on demand music and offline listening, and costs $9.99 per month. And yes, a free 30-day trial is available.
* As usual, we’ll let you know as soon as the app hits.
