* Apple announced a major software update for iDevices last week, iOS 5. The new firmware will introduce over 200 new features in iOS, and is expected to seriously impact the jailbreak community.
* But jailbreakers haven’t skipped a beat since the beta version of iOS 5 rolled out last Monday. Within 24 hours of the release, jailbreak software was updated to support the new firmware. Now you can add Sn0wbreeze to that list of iOS 5 compatible tools…
* As with the RedSn0w update, the Sn0wbreeze jailbreak for iOS 5 beta is only available in tethered form. This means you’ll need to be by a computer during reboots, as you’ll essentially have to re-jailbreak each time the device restarts.
* This shouldn’t be too big of deal for the time being though, since the only ones who are supposed to have copies of iOS 5 are developers (and even they’re not really supposed to be using it on their main device).
* But nevertheless, folks who are running the beta and are looking for a way to jailbreak it, check out Sn0wbreeze. The easy to use software works with all iOS 5 compatible devices, except the iPad 2 of course, and enables you to play with new tweaks like UISettings.
* Sn0wbreeze 2.8b1 is for Windows only and can be downloaded here. If you need a refresher on how to jailbreak your iDevice with Sn0wbreeze, feel free to check out our tutorial here.
* Any questions?
