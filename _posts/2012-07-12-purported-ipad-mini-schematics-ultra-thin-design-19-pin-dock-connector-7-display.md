* An alleged iPad mini case mold got leaked out two days ago, showing a smaller dock connector. This morning, a purported schematics depicting an iPad mini has hit the web. According to ThinkiOS (via 9to5Mac), these drawings confirm whispers that the iPad mini will sport a seven-inch display and a brand new 19-pin dock connector instead of the regular 30-pin dock connector.
* As a result, all existing peripherals could be potentially rendered obsolete. Another thing to glean from the images: the iPad mini could be really, really thin…
* How thin, you ask. Just 7.2mm, which is in line with a report by the Japanese blog Macotakara from five days ago, claiming that the iPad mini will have 3G, be produced in Brazil and have a body thin almost as the iPod touch’s slim 7.2mm profile.
* According to our source iPad Mini will have a 7-inch screen, and will be 5.3-inch wide and 7.87-inch long. For the sake of comparison, the new iPad is 9.50-inches tall, 7.31-inches wide, and has a depth of 0.37-inches.
* If this rumor pans out, the iPad mini will be one hell of an attractive device thanks to its thinness.

* Based on the schematics, case maker FullHull has created this rendering.

* Just earlier this morning, another case maker published images of iPhone 5 case molds that indicate a 20 percent thinner design and also a smaller dock connector.
* It’s believed this alleged 19-pin dock connector will be rolled out to all future iOS devices. We’re concerned about backwards compatibility with existing peripherals, though.
* Perhaps Apple will make available a converter dongle of sorts? While Apple’s third-party accessories ecosystem is worth billions of dollars annually, the company never had a problem leaving legacy technologies behind, even if it meant screwing everyone in its food chain.
* What do you guy think?
