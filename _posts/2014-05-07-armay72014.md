* While the App Store is refreshed with featured apps each Thursday by Apple, many of the new games and apps begin showing up today around 11:00 PM Eastern. So we’ve gone ahead and included many of these early releases in today’s edition of App Recap, a daily column that promotes new, updated and discounted apps for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. App Recap supplements the more in-depth app coverage that Lory, Christian, Cody and our other writers provide during the daytime. Take a look at the roundup ahead… 
* Build an all-star team with MLB Perfect Inning, a new game that arrives just over one month into the baseball season.
