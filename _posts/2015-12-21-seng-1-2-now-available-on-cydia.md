* Seng, the Auxo-inspired App Switcher replacement for jailbroken iOS devices, is now available for download on Cydia. The tweak has been in beta for the last few weeks, but today it is available to all jailbroken iOS 9 users.
* We’ve already covered version 1.2 of Seng in depth via our hands-on video review, and we found a tweak that was well worth consideration. Better yet, if you already purchased the iOS 8 compatible version of Seng, the this latest iOS 9 compatible version can be had as a free update.
* A lot of people were vocal about the recent changes that took place with the iOS 9 compatible version of Auxo 3. Some liked them, but still more didn’t like them. Personally speaking, I think I’m in the latter camp. Although Auxo is truly the original, and it feels a little wrong for me to prefer what is an obvious clone of Auxo, it’s hard to argue that Seng doesn’t make for a better experience on the latest jailbreakable iOS software version.
* You can purchase the iOS 9 version of Seng right now from Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $2.50. Again, if you already own Seng, this 1.2 release can be had as a free update.
* Do you think Seng is a worthy Auxo alternative? Sound off in the comments page below.
