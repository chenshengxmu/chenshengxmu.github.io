* In time for the start of the 2014 Major League Baseball (MLB) season, the official MLB.com At Bat app has finally received its long-expected iOS 7-focused redesign. This is a major refresh as the app was last updated in October 2013.
* MLB.com At Bat version 7.0, now available free in the App Store, has hit a home run for iOS 7 with a brand new interface (flatter, of course), a new league-wide scoreboard functionality and inline video playback. I’ve included a few screenshots of the new design and some additional tidbits right below the fold…
* Here’s the app’s new iOS 7-friendly icon for your Home screen.

* The app includes access to the Spring Training through the World Series.
* This new version has been thoroughly redesign for iOS 7 aesthetics, down to the flattened experience and the use of the familiar swiping gesture to navigate between the menus. In addition to the visual changes, the app now delivers inline video playback and includes a new league-wide scoreboard functionality for single-tap expansion.
