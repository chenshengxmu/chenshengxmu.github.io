* An Italian apparel company has won the right to use the name Steve Jobs, reports Italian site la Repubblica Napoli (via The Verge). After a lengthy legal battle with Apple, the clothing co can now freely use the name of the iPhone-maker’s beloved founder in its designs.
* After discovering that Apple hadn’t trademarked the brand Steve Jobs, brothers Vincenzo and Giacomo Barbato decided to use the name for their new company in 2012. They also created a logo that resembled Apple’s own—a large J with a leaf and a bite taken out of it.
* Apple, of course, sued the pair for using Jobs’ name and a logo that resembles their iconic bitten fruit. The lawsuit focused on the logo, which ended up being a bad idea. The IP Office ruled that since the letter J is not edible, the missing chunk couldn’t be perceived as a bite.

* The Steve Jobs clothing company currently produces t-shirts, jeans and other clothing items and accessories, but the brothers say that they plan to produce electronic devices under the brand name as well. “We are working on a line of highly innovative electronic devices.” Oh boy.
