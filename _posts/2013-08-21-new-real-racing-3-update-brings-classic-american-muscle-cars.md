* One of the key reasons I used to burn midnight oil quite a lot playing Driver on the original PlayStation – apart from the locations (Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York) and the awesome controls coupled to realistic physics – is the vehicle lineup, the sort of cars you see smashed in the 1960-1970s car chase and cop movies.
* To fans of such legendary cars as the Dodge, Shelby and other big V8 muscle cars: Electronic Arts’s latest content update to free-to-play Real Racing 3 is a no-brainer.
* That’s right, you can now own classic Detroit metal in this Real Racing 3 update, as well as race friends on a bunch of new tracks, appreciate physics enhancements, better camera angles and lots more…
* Check out the trailer.

* There are also some notable new events, including one that has you competing in multiple challenging series featuring “a field of muscle cars hailing from Detroit”.
* The enhanced physics engine takes care of the more realistic pitch and bodyroll while the improved and more accurate skill adjustment allows for better competition, with enhanced cameras giving you a better sense of speed.
* Additional social networking options for enhanced Time Shifted Multiplayer and Cloud Save functionality are also part of this version 1.3 update. Should you encounter issues setting up iCloud saves, this help doc will come in handy.
* The previous update focused on some of the world’s most prestigious cars such as the Mercedes-Benz and Bentley vehicles.
* Real Racing 3 costs zero bucks on the App Store and Google’s Play store.
* If you’re looking for something different, keep an eye on Gameloft’s forthcoming Asphalt 8: Airborne, scheduled to land on the US App Store this midnight.
