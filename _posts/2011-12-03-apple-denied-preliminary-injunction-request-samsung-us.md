title: Apple Denied Preliminary Injunction Request Against Samsung in the US
---
* This is a big victory for Samsung in the US, which could change the course of legal battles between the two companies in other countries. Reuters reports:
* Apple failed to convince a U.S. judge to block Samsung Electronics from selling Galaxy smartphones and tablets in the U.S. market, depriving the iPhone and iPad maker of crucial leverage in a global patent battle between the two companies.
* I wish Apple and Samsung would reach an agreement so we can put this behind us once and for all.
