* I’ve never been a big themer; in fact, even though it’s jailbroken I take pride in the fact that my iPhone looks pretty much stock most of the time.
* Besides a few obvious omissions from my iPhone’s Home screen, I try to keep it as clean as I possibly can.
* With that in mind, it’s no surprise that I’m not really big into WinterBoard, and other apps that allow you to customize the look of your iPhone.
* There’s a new exception to that rule, though. A new jailbreak app by the name of AlertArtist piqued my interest, and I’ve been hooked ever since…

* AlertArtist, as its name easily gives away, is a jailbreak app that lets you spruce up your iPhone’s alerts; that means push notifications, alarms, everything.
* While some customization apps of this nature require a degree in rocket science, you’ll immediately come to appreciate AlertArtist’s easy to navigate user interface.

* If Apple would have included a built in option that lets you design the look of your notifications, this is probably a good indicator of how it would operate.
* Virtually every aspect of your alerts can be modified; the background, border, shadow, and text colors can all be adjusted using simple RGB sliders. There’s even an option to adjust the transparency of each component that makes up an alert.

* Title and body fonts are not exempt from all out customization either, as each can be tuned with well over a dozen different font selections and sizes.
* After you’ve finished creating your masterpiece you have the option to name and save it to a custom theme where you can easily retrieve it later.

* As a bonus, the developer has even tossed in six custom themes if artistry isn’t exactly your forte’.
* At only $0.99 on the Cydia store, AlertArtist gives you a lot of bang for your buck. If Apple is going to continue to subject us to their horrible method of notifications, at least now we can make them look pretty.
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone, head over to Cydia and let me know what you think after you try it out.
