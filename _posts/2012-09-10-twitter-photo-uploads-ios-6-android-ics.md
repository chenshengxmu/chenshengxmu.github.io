* One of the cool enhancements in iOS 6 Safari is its broader support for standard HTML elements, including a regular HTML input element used on literally all sites requiring media uploading capability.
* This support for media uploads lets Safari understand the standard Upload button that invokes a file picker on your desktop and replace it with standard iOS media picker.
* Up until now, you could only test this on certain web sites, like the desktop Facebook interface in mobile Safari. Today, Twitter enabled on its mobile site photo uploads from a browser on iOS 6 and Android Ice Cream Sandwich devices, here’s how it works…
* It’s pretty straightforward, really.
* According to Sociable, which first spotted changes in the mobile web interface, Twitter is expanding its already established native app functionality to mobile.twitter.com with the new Upload button.
* Sung Hu Kim, one of Twitter’s mobile product manager, later tweeted this image using a mobile device and took to Twitter (where else) confirming that the image was tweeted from his phone’s browser rather than a native Twitter app.
* Interestingly, uploading from a device’s camera is also supported.
* I’m so glad Safari in iOS 6 finally understands media uploads.

* I ran a couple times into situations where I needed to update some web content on my iPhone, but couldn’t because Safari didn’t support media uploads. I am also a big fan of Safari’s full-screen mode in landscape (why not in portrait, too?).

* You probably will also love Smart App Banners in iOS 6 Safari that automatically pop up on supported web sites to offer native iOS apps instead of the mobile web experience.
* These prompts are helpful as they include iTunes ratings, a link to the app’s description on the App Store or – if you have the app installed – a button to launch it immediately.
* You can also dismiss the banner and it won’t re-appear on subsequent visits.
* Have a look, if you will, at Smart App Banners by visiting the online Apple Store using iOS 6 Safari.
* While Smart App Banners file as nice-to-haves, I have a feeling a whole lots more people will find use for media uploads in Safari.
* Can you say media uploading capability is one of the features of iOS 6 Safari that you’ll be using?
