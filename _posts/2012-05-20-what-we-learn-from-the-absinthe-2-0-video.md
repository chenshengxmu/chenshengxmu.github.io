* Now that a video showcasing the Absinthe 2.0 iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak has finally surfaced, we can glean additional details about what to expect when the tool is released to the public.
* If you haven’t already seen our posts outing the name of the highly anticipated tool, or our post with the video of Absinthe in action, then be sure to take a look at those respective posts.
* The nice thing about seeing the tool in action for the first time, is that we can have a clearer idea as to what to expect once the tool is released.
* Here is what we’ve found so far…
* Other points of note:
* We’re still analyzing all of the facts we have thus far, and we will update this post with anything we find regarding this exciting time in the jailbreak community.
* If you have anything to add, or any observations to note, please let us know what you find in the comments below.
* Update: I’ve confirmed directly with MuscleNerd that a) A CLI version of the 5.1.1 jailbreak will be released, and b) the iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak will be incorporated directly into RedSn0w as an all inclusive package. As far as time frames go, those are still undetermined.
* @JeffBenjam yes and yes

* If the past is anything to go by, then we may see a CLI version of the 5.1.1 jailbreak released alongside Absinthe 2.0. Please keep in mind that no time table has been confirmed by the iPhone Dev Team, so any time estimates are just conjecture on our end. Still this is very good news for the community.
