* If Apple’s litigation team thinks they have a pretty good case against Samsung for violating trade dress, wait until they get wind of this new iPhone-imitating Android device.
* While blatant iPhone rip-offs certainly aren’t anything new, the fact that a major U.S. retail chain like Sears is selling them is kind of surprising. Even though the device touts some big features, iDB has a pool going on just how long this device remains available…
* There’s no visible brand name in the Sears.com ad, nor are there currently any reviews of the product. However, the device does sport a 3.5 inch capacitive multi-touch display and dual SIM card slots, so it’s likely to appeal to someone.
* Folks who have jailbroken iPhones running apps like iAndroid, in search of the Apple-look-with-an-Android-feel combo might really dig something like this. At $263.99 though, I think I’ll stick with the original.
* How long until this device gets pulled? Would you buy something like this?

* UPDATE: Well that didn’t take long, did it? Just a few hours after we posted the article, Sears pulled the product. Go figure.
* UPDATE 2: It’s been moved to a different page, but it’s still on Sears website.
