* Apple’s marketing should make a final decision on the next iPhone’s name as the last step in pre-launch preparations. Many fans have expected the handset to be called iPhone 8, but a new report suggests the device will be marketed as iPhone X.
* That’s according to a report from Dutch site iCulture (Google Translate), which learned from a reliable source who’s working for a global mobile phone operator that the upcoming 5.8-inch flagship OLED iPhone will “definitely be called iPhone X.”
* This source predicted the 10.5-inch iPad Pro’s exact launch date, lending it some credibility.
* The source claims that a team of higher-ups at this provider visited Apple’s Cupertino headquarters last Thursday. The managers discussed launch details and were reportedly told that 2017 iPhones would be adopting the following nomenclature:
* The source added that pre-orders for the new phones will open on Friday, September 15, with the devices scheduled to land on store shelves the following Friday on September 22.
* 9to5Mac somewhat corroborated the report, saying that Apple will indeed skip the S-branding and go straight from iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 rather than iPhone 7s.
* The site, however, claims that the OLED iPhone will be marketed as “iPhone Edition”.
* 9to5Mac has ostensibly learned this from case makers at IFA in Berlin, Germany.
* “One case maker has updated its internal SKUs based on the info and is actively printing packaging which I was able to see in the form of preliminary artwork,” says the report. “The other had made sticker labels which they were showing to their partners behind closed doors.”
* Both makers requested anonymity “for obvious reasons.”
* I’m glad that Apple is potentially abandoning the S-branding for new iPhones because it’s gotten a bit boring and, in my opinion, has never clearly telegraphed the fact that S-upgrades actually get, in most cases, better hardware upgrades.
