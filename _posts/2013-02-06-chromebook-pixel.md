title: Google testing own built Retina Chromebook?

* Word on the street, based on a Google+ post by developer François Beaufort, is that Google is developing a Retina-fied Chromebook featuring a 2,560-by-1,700 resolution (that’s four million pixels for those counting). Surprisingly enough, it would file as the first Google-built notebook as today’s Chromebooks are built by Samsung, Acer and Hewlett-Packard.
* For reference, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display has a 2,560-by-1,600 resolution (2,880-by-1,800 on the 15-inch variant). Unlike the MacBook Pro, this so-called Chromebook Pixel will apparently have touch capabilities of some sort…
* Apple’s decision to incorporate multi-touch features via gestures on the glass trackpad worked out well for MacBooks so we’re curious how Google intends to solve touch on notebooks. I’m also thinking Google may find that building an affordable high-resolution notebook is not as easy as putting an ultra-high resolution panel inside (hint: CPU/GPU performance).
* According to AndroidAuthority, Francois spotted an unreleased Chromebook in log files with some crazy pixel count. He claims it’s code-named the “Link” and says Google’s currently testing it.
* Soon after the video hit Google Plus, the clip was taken down, but we were able to snatch a copy.
* The video description suggested that the clip was made by a company called Slinky.me, whose CEO Victor Koch then took to Google Plus to announce that its servers were attacked by hackers.
* Attackers than allegedly made several videos of projects that Slinky.me was working on available on YouTube.
* By the way, the video top of post is just a concept so don’t get too excited (yet).
* “The more pixels we add, the more wonderful the world,” says voiceover.
* I like the tagline: “Designed by Google. Down to the last pixel.”
* The video conveys the message is a playful manner, very much reminiscent of Apple’s advertising.
* Here’s Apple’s simple yet powerful Retina MacBook Pro ad.

* Not sure who’s providing voiceover for Apple’s ads, but that radio voice is awesome.
* Are you calling shenanigans on this one?
* Or could Google possibly be working on a Retina Chromebook?
