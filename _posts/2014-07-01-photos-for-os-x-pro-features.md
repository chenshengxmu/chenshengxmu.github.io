* Apple’s surprise announcement that it will cease development of its Aperture app in favor of Photos for OS X Yosemite has left watchers scratching their head. There’s also the problem of prosumers and iPhone photography enthusiasts, many of whom have grown dependent on Aperture workflows.
* The problem is even more pronounced given concerns that any feature-parity between Photos on iOS 8 and the upcoming Photos for OS X Yosemite Macs would inevitably lead to significant dumbing down compared to Aperture’s feature set.
* Case in point: the iWork for iCloud effect.
* Anyway, Apple has now official confirmed via a written statement that Photos for Mac will include certain pro-grade features such as photo editing, image search and third-party effects and plugins…
* An Apple representative said this in a statement to ArsTechnica, via MacRumors.
* When asked about what Aperture-like features users can expect from the new Photos app, an Apple representative mentioned plans for professional-grade features such as image search, editing, effects, and most notably, third-party extensibility.
* The representative also clarified the timeframe when Aperture development will end, along with an announcement about its other Pro app offerings receiving updates today.
* Third-party extensibility is pretty much a no-brainer considering that new iOS 8 APIs allow developers to write third-party photo and video effects for the stock Photos app.
* From Apple’s iOS 8 for Developers webpage:
* Embed your filters and editing tools directly into the Photos app, so users can easily apply your effects to images and videos without having to import them into your app.
* Third-party effects will be non-destructive so you’ll be able to undo the changes, similar to how Apple-produced effects applied to your images within iOS Photos are undoable.

* Theoretically speaking, if a developer releases the same set of filters for both Photos for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, and with iCloud Photos enabled, you should be able to apply filters to Camera roll images on your iPhone and then undo the changes on your Mac.
* Photos will release early next year for OS X Yosemite systems.
* Apple’s Aperture announcement last week was accompanied by a new screenshot of the software.
* As seen top of post, it depicts a bunch of common photo editing effects like Exposure, Highlights, Shadows, Brightness, Contrast, Blacks, Saturation, Contrast, Cast, Hue Strength, Neutral Boost, Photo Tone, Grain, Definition, Vignette, White Balance and Levels.
* Who’s looking forward to Photos for Mac?
