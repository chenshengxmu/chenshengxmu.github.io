* In the past I’ve wondered why Apple seems to neglect its dynamic theme options, yet every year there are new static themes available for iOS. Unfortunately, for those of us who like them, dynamic themes seem to have been placed permanently on the shelf.
* An upcoming jailbreak package looks to change this by offering several new well-designed dynamic themes to jailbroken iOS users. It’s aptly entitled Dynamics, and it will be released once the teaser version receives 500 downloads.
* Open the Cydia Store, search for Dynamics Teaser, and you should find the package from designer Polar Hacker. The teaser package, like the full sized version, requires WinterBoard to run. Once you have the Dynamics Teaser package installed, head over to the WinterBoard preferences, enable the theme, and respring.

* Next, you’ll need to select a dynamic wallpaper from Settings → Wallpapers. It doesn’t matter which theme you select, as long as it is of the dynamic variety. The developer recommends installing HiddenWallpapers, which presents five additional dynamic wallpaper options to the user, and I definitely agree. The rainbow black wallpaper that HiddenWallpapers adds to the mix is second to none.
* Once you have everything configured, you should see the Dynamics Teaser wallpaper. While this teaser is nice, the full package, which is not yet available on Cydia, is really great. With the full Dynamics theme, you get the following dynamic wallpapers:
* All of the above themes add some definite variety to the iOS wallpaper, especially when mixed in with HiddenWallpapers. Although you can’t have the full package now, you can still try the Dynamic Teaser theme for a real glimpse into what this theme will do once available. In fact, if you want Dynamics sooner, then you should download the Dynamic Teaser, since MacCiti repo won’t release the full $0.99 package until the teaser has 500 downloads.
* As a bonus, designer Polar Hacker will be giving away 10 free copies of Dynamics once released. Want one? Leave a comment along with your Cydia ID down below, and he will chose 10 fortunate readers at random once released.
* What do you think about Dynamics? Do you think it will revitalize the stagnant dynamic wallpapers on iOS?
