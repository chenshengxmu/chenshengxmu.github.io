* It’s no secret that I consider biteSMS to be an absolute iPhone staple; it’s among the first apps that I install after jailbreaking my iPhone.
* For those of you who, like me, decide to jailbreak your iOS 5 installation, you’ll find that the public version of biteSMS crashes upon launch.
* Fortunately, the biteSMS team has produced a beta version of their popular SMS app that works great on iOS 5. Check inside for the full details on how to score it for yourself…
* To add the fully functional beta version of biteSMS to your iOS 5 installation, simply add the following repo to your list of Cydia sources:
* biteSMS beta repo: http://test-cydia.bitesms.com
* Upon installation, you may need to reboot your device. Just keep in mind that since iOS 5 is currently a tethered jailbreak, and you will have to perform a tethered boot to get back to your Home screen.
* As you can see from the video, biteSMS has changed a bit in both the looks and functionality department. It even integrates nicely with iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* What do you think about the latest version of biteSMS?
