* Confirming speculation, Apple just announced via a press release that its annual developer conference will run this year from June 11 through June 15 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, a week after this year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo show. Tickets are now on sale, available from $1,599 for conference passes.
* If history is anything to go by, WWDC 2012 will sell out in a matter of hours. If you’re planning on attending the conference, better get your tickets right now, right here.
* Unlike previous WWDCs, however, this time around Apple is mandating that attendees with conference passes be members of one of their developer programs…
* Apple quoted in the press releases its senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, Philip Schiller:
* We have a great WWDC planned this year and can’t wait to share the latest news about iOS and OS X Mountain Lion with developers. The iOS platform has created an entirely new industry with fantastic opportunities for developers across the country and around the world.
* The mention of the iOS platform is a strong indication that WWDC 2012 could see Apple preview iOS 6, the next major updated to its mobile operating system.
* The WWDC website provides an overview of the sessions planned for the five-day conference, including:
* • more than 100 technical sessions presented by Apple engineers on a wide range of technology-specific topics for developing, deploying and integrating the latest iOS and OS X technologies • 100 hands-on labs staffed by more than 1,000 Apple engineers providing developers with code-level assistance, insight into optimal development techniques and guidance on how they can make the most of iOS and OS X technologies in their apps • the opportunity to connect with thousands of fellow iOS and OS X developers from around the world—last year more than 60 countries were represented • engaging and inspirational lunchtime sessions with leading minds and influencers from the worlds of technology, science and entertainment • Apple Design Awards which recognize iPhone®, iPad® and Mac® apps that demonstrate technical excellence, innovation and outstanding design.
* A scholarship program for full or part-time students age 13 or older is also available. Nominations for the 2012 Apple Design Awards for outstanding iOS and Mac apps are also open.
* We’re expecting various other updates at WWDC 2012. Specifically, Apple should update us on the progress of OS X Mountain Lion and likely unveil a refreshed MacBook lineup right on the heels of Intel’s Ivy Bridge announcement.
* What are your expectations for WWDC 2012?
