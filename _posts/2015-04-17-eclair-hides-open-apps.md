* Have you ever unlocked your iPhone only to be presented with an app or website that you didn’t want to appear? Perhaps you were previously looking at something embarrassing, shopping for a gift, etc.
* I know I always kill my Music app after listening to my favorite Taylor Swift songs, because I don’t want people to judge me. The problem is, it’s nearly impossible to always remember to do this, and it’s easy to forget what you had opened last.
* Eclair is a brand new jailbreak tweak that remedies this issue. It will automatically hide the last opened app after locking your device. That way, you’ll be met with a Home screen page instead of the last running app.
* Once you install Eclair, you can configure its settings via the stock Settings app. Not only does Eclair have the ability to hide the last opened app, it can also kill apps and prevent certain apps from being hidden or killed by means of a blacklist feature. There’s even an option for managing now playing music apps, and for returning to the first page of the iPhone’s SpringBoard.
* If you’ve ever encountered the aforementioned problem, then you know that just one occurrence is one too many. With that in mind, Eclair is a must-have tweak for me going forward. Just having the ability to control what appears when I unlock my device is worth the price of admission.
* If you’d like to try Eclair, head over to the BigBoss repo where it can be downloaded for $0.99. Let me know what you think about it down below in the comments.
