* Like with most Apple devices, you can customize the HomePod name to your liking.
* By default, a HomePod is listed as “HomePod.” I always rename my Apple devices to something more descriptive, like “Chris’s iPhone X”, “Living room Apple TV” and so forth.
* Renaming a HomePod makes it easier to distinguish from other AirPlay devices in Control Center and other menus. As another advantage, HomePod is also denoted by its name on the list of iCloud devices found in Settings on iOS, System Preferences on macOS and iCloud.com on the web.
* TUTORIAL: stopping HomePod from polluting your Apple Music recommendations
* If you happen to live in a household with a bunch of Apple devices, identifying them in the AirPlay, AirDrop and other menus gets confusing fast. Therefore, you need more descriptive names for your Apple gadgets, like “Mom’s iPhone 7”, “Dad’s iPad” and so forth.
* This may be especially important to the lucky owners of multiple HomePods.
* As an example, one of your HomePods might be located in your living room, safely tucked under the television, while the other could be sitting on your desk in the garage. You’d be wise to give each HomePod a custom name so you don’t get them mixed up.
* Here’s how to do just that.
* You can customize settings for an individual HomePod, including changing its name from the default “HomePod” to something more descriptive, by using the Home app on your iPhone.
* Keep in mind that your iPhone must be running iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* 2) Press your HomePod with 3D Touch or long-tap it.
* 3) Tap the button Details in the lower-right corner.
* 4) Tap the default “HomePod” name listed at the top.

* 5) Type in the new name for the speaker.
* 6) Tap Done when finished.
* It may take a few seconds or minutes for your newly assigned HomePod name to synchronize through iCloud across all your connected Apple devices, apps and services.
* TIP: you can also create a custom name for the room your HomePod is in.
