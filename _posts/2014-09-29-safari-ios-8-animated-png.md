* Safari on iOS 8 has been found to support animated PNG images (APNG), a standard conceived as a replacement for animated GIF, as discovered by MacRumors on Monday.
* The Animated Portable Network Graphics file format was proposed in 2004, but failed to take off as a replacement for the animated GIF file format widely used to embed short animations online.
* Unlike animated GIFs, APNG files support 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency not available for GIFs.
* According to Wikipedia, the APNG file format also retains backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files so browsers that don’t feature support for APNGs can still render still images.
* As MacRumors points out, Safari on iOS 8 is capable of animating APNGs. If you are reading this article using Safari on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, the APNG embedded bellow should animate.

* Loading this webpage in any other browser, including Safari on non-Yosemite Macs, would only display the static image.
* The PNG group rejected the proposed APNG specification back in 2007 due to the lack of support from major browser vendor. To this date, only Firefox has supported APNGs.
* In addition to Safari on iOS 8, Safari on Yosemite has also been found to support APNGs.
* And thanks to the WebKit changes Apple’s made on iOS 8, third-party applications are finally allowed to use the same speedy improved Nitro JavaScript as the stock Safari app.
* The change benefits applications which embed the in-app browser, like Tweetbot and many others. Another example is Google’s Chrome, which on iOS 8 benefits from the speed gains provided by Safari’s improved JavaScript interpreter.
* As a reminder, all App Store apps use the embedded Safari engine because Apple does not allow third-party frameworks for web content.
