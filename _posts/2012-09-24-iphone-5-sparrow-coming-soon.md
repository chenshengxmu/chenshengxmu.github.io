* According to co-founder and developer Dominique Leca, the Sparrow team (now part of Google’s Gmail team) is working on a minor update that will enable support for the iPhone 5 and its taller screen. “iPhone 5 support is coming soon to Sparrow”, Dominique wrote on Twitter.
* Still a big fan and regular user of Sparrow on both the Mac and iOS platform, I sure am pleased that they are continuing to provide at least basic level of support to ensure the program runs smoothly on refreshed devices…
* Google in July sent shockwaves throughout the tech community by announcing it would acquire Sparrow for its engineering team.
* The search Goliath confirmed only maintenance releases would be worked on as the Sparrow team got integrated with Google’s Gmail team.
* As a result, no new features would be developed, Google said.
* Still, Google pleasantly surprised fans with a small August updated which brought support for Google’s “Open in Chrome” action, also present in the updated Gmail for iOS app.
* Also, the Sparrow team released open-source components of the Sparrow mobile app, but for personal use only.
