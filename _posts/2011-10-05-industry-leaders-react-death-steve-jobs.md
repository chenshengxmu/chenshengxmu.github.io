* The world lost a leader today. Steve Jobs, the man that pioneered the age of personal computing and then killed it with devices like the iPhone and iPad, has passed away. Apple.com/SteveJobs will take you to his tribute page.
* The internet and blogosphere is literally quaking under the wake of this news, and we’ve gathered official statements from Jobs’ family, the Apple board, and people like Bill Gates and the President of the United States…
* His family:
* “Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family.
* In his public life, Steve was known as a visionary; in his private life, he cherished his family. We are thankful to the many people who have shared their wishes and prayers during the last year of Steve’s illness; a website will be provided for those who wish to offer tributes and memories.
* We are grateful for the support and kindness of those who share our feelings for Steve. We know many of you will mourn with us, and we ask that you respect our privacy during our time of grief.”
* Apple’s board of directors:
* “We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today.
* Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.
* His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts.”
* Tim Cook, current CEO of Apple, in an email to Apple employees:
* “Team,
* I have some very sad news to share with all of you. Steve passed away earlier today.
* Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.
* We are planning a celebration of Steve’s extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon. If you would like to share your thoughts, memories and condolences in the interim, you can simply email rememberingsteve@apple.com.
* No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve’s death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him. We will honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much.
* Tim”
* President Barack Obama
* “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was among the greatest of American innovators – brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.
* By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.
* The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.”
* Bill Gates, former CEO and cofounder of Microsoft:
* “I’m truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs’ death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work.
* Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives.
* The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come.
* For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.”
* Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook:
* “Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you.”
* Larry Page, CEO and cofounder of Google:
* “I am very, very sad to hear the news about Steve. He was a great man with incredible achievements and amazing brilliance. He always seemed to be able to say in very few words what you actually should have been thinking before you thought it. His focus on the user experience above all else has always been an inspiration to me. He was very kind to reach out to me as I became CEO of Google and spend time offering his advice and knowledge even though he was not at all well. My thoughts and Google’s are with his family and the whole Apple family.”
* Eric Schmidt, Google Chairman and former CEO of Google:
* “Steve Jobs is the most successful CEO in the U.S. of the last 25 years. He uniquely combined an artists touch and an engineers vision to build an extraordinary company… one of the greatest American leaders in history.”
* Bob Iger, president of Disney:
* “Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted advisor. His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built. It will be the millions of people he inspired, the lives he changed, and the culture he defined. Steve was such an “original,” with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time.”
* Michael Dell, founder of Dell:
* “Today the world lost a visionary leader, the technology industry lost an iconic legend and I lost a friend and fellow founder. The legacy of Steve Jobs will be remembered for generatio
