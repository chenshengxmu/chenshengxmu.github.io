* FiftyThree, makers of the popular iPad drawing app Paper which supports a range of styli, on Tuesday teased a forthcoming Paper refresh that will bring full iPhone compatibility.
* Paper for iPhone is “coming soon,” wrote developers on a newly published webpage where you can register your interest and sign up to be notified when the app hits the App Store.
* Or, just follow iDownloadBlog as we’ll be making sure to keep you in the loop.
* Paper has been an award-winning iPad-exclusive following its App Store debut three years ago. A super short blog post on FiftyThree’s website provides little, if anything, in terms of what we can expect from Paper for iPhone.
* A teaser image they shared, seen top of post, offers a small glimpse into the app’s user interface on an iPhone 6.
* Over time, the iPad app has gained a bunch of advanced features and tools, quickly becoming arguably one of the best iPad drawing apps available in the App Store.
* The app supports a range of styli from both FiftyThree and third-parties so it will be interesting to see Paper’s stylus support in action on the 4.7 and 5.5-inch screens of the present-generation iPhones.
* Asked by a Twitter user if the iPad app will support iOS 9’s split screen modes, developers responded rather cryptically, saying “it is a popular request that we are keeping in mind but do not have any announcements at the moment.”
* FiftyThree has confirmed that Paper for iPhone will support all iPhones from the iPhones 4s onward. iOS 8.0 or later will be required.
* The company did not say whether Paper for iPhone will be a standalone app, a free update to the iPad app or a paid In-App Purchase upgrade.
* Watch this space as we’ll be posting more information as it becomes available.
