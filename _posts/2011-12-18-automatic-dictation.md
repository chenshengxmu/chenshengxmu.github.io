* It’s not Siri. In fact, it’s not even close. Yet, you still may find it interesting enough to give it a shot, especially if you’re already a user of Voice Activator.
* Automatic Dictation is essentially a meshing together of Voice Activator and Dragon Dictation. It basically allows you to (almost) use Dragon Dictation completely handsfree. It even allows you to send tweets directly from your dictation screen.
* In the end, it’s a very clunky semi-hand-free solution that works, but it’s definitely no Siri…
* Automatic Dictation is a free jailbreak tweak on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. You can use it solely with Activator, or combine it with the paid tweak Voice Activator for a much better experience.
* It’s a valiant attempt, yet the complexity of the setup ultimately falls flat in my opinion. Let me know what you think about Automatic Dictation in the comments below.
