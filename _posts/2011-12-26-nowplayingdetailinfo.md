* Finding your iPhone’s App Switcher music info a bit on the feeble side? If so, and your iPhone is jailbroken, try out NowPlayingDetailInfo.
* This free jailbreak tweak provides detailed information about the song currently playing in your App Switcher, and it works with 3rd party apps like Spotify. Check inside for a hands-on video analysis of NowPlayingDetailInfo…
* There are obviously other tweaks in the past that have done similar things, and this one is just the latest rendition.
* Still, you can’t go wrong with NowPlayingDetailInfo; it’s free on Cydia’s BigBoss Repo and it works well if your iPhone is jailbroken running iOS 5.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
