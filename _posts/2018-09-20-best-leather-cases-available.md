* Looking for the best leather case for your iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max? You’ve come to the right place. We’ve put together a small, carefully-curated roundup of what we believe are the best leather cases available for Apple’s two new handsets.

* If you’re in the market for a leather case, you absolutely have to check out Pad & Quill. Their expert leatherworkers do incredible work on everything from bags to wallets, and the same goes for their Traveler case.
* iPhone XS $60
* iPhone XS Max $60

* We also really like the Rugged Case from Nomad. It’s a little more rigid than the one from Pad & Quill, made up of high-grade polycarbonate, a TPE bumper and a Horween leather exterior. Rated for 6-foot drop protection.
* iPhone XS $45
* iPhone XS Max $45

* Wrapped in Mujjo’s signature leather, this slim case features holes for the rear camera lenses and Mute switch, and is completely open across the bottom for docking. Plus, it’s lined with fine microfiber for extra padding.
* iPhone XS $45
* iPhone XS Max $55

* It’s not hard to see why we like this one from Case-Mate. It’s ultra-thin (2mm) and made of genuine premium leather. Other features include a microfiber interior, openings for the buttons and rear camera, and a lifetime warranty.
* iPhone XS $36
* iPhone XS Max $40

* The Strada Series case from OtterBox might be the most rigid of the group. It’s made of premium leather and features a folio-style design that has built-in vertical slots for securely storing your cards or cash. Lifetime warranty.
* iPhone XS $30
* iPhone XS Max $60

* You can’t make a list like this without including Apple’s Leather Case. It’s made of specially tanned and finished European leather and has an internal microfiber lining. Plus, the button covers are made of machined aluminum.
* iPhone XS $49
* iPhone XS Max $49
* And that should just about cover it! Obviously this is just a few of the leather cases available, and we plan to add more to this list as we get more review units in and more become available for order. And as always, if you know of a case that isn’t on this list and deserves to be, let us know about it in the comments below!
