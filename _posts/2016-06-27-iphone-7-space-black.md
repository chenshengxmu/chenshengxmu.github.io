* Remember the iPhone 5’s Darth Vader-like black appearance? It’s still my favorite iPhone colorway even though Apple has since moved to a more subdued Space Gray finish for subsequent models. Mac Otakara, the Japanese publication which claimed the iPhone 7 would come in a new Deep Blue variant, has now backtracked on the report, saying the device would include a Space Black colorway akin to the Apple Watch.
* In an update this morning to the original Mac Otakara article, the publication now claims that the next iPhone could actually be updated with a much darker color resembling the Apple Watch’s Space Black colorway.
* “The new color would not be deep blue, but possibly formal black which is close to black,” reads a machine-translated passage from the report. 9to5Mac has confirmed the rumor with its own anonymous source, cautioning that even though the source has “absolutely no track record”, their IP address is located near Apple’s headquarters.
* 9to5Mac has also learned that the next iPhone would retain the physical Home button with two distinct improvements: the non-moving button will be flush with the front face and sport haptic feedback to simulate a click, using the same approach as Force Touch.
