* Bad news this afternoon for Plants vs. Zombies fans. Electronic Arts has announced today that the highly anticipated sequel to PopCap’s popular lane defense game will not launch next month as it had originally anticipated.
* A few weeks ago, PopCap announced that the game, officially titled ‘Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time,’ would be released on July 18. But it appears EA—its parent company—thinks it needs more time to fine tune things…
* Here’s the tweet from the official Plants vs. Zombies Twitter account:
* Plants vs. Zombies 2, originally slated for a July 18th release, will now be released later in the summer. Stay tuned for more details.

* And here’s the official trailer for those who haven’t seen it yet:
* In subsequent tweets, PopCap notes that the game will still launch on “Apple products first,” as it was originally announced and scheduled for iOS. But it does intend to eventually publish the title on other platforms and consoles.
* The team showed off a beta version of Plants vs. Zombies 2 at E3 earlier this month, and it received positive reviews—apart from the fact that it intends to move to a free-to-play model with support from various in-app purchases.
* There’s been some speculation that PopCap may be reconsidering going freemium with the game. But knowing EA, who is behind the wildly successful free-to-play Simpsons: Tapped Out series, we wouldn’t bet our money on it.
