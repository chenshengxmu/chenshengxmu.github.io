* Some folks with iOS 10 beta 2 installed on their iPhone are finding that they’ve been locked out of their Apple ID account, unable to perform a password reset. As per a new thread on Reddit, the problem seems to affect a portion of iOS 10 beta 2 users whose Apple ID account has been protected with Apple’s two-step authentication system, which requires both a password and a one-time six-digit code when using iCloud on a new device.
* We’re posting this as convenience for those who have been affected. If you’re seeing this, you probably don’t need to worry about your Apple ID being hacked and unrecoverable, it’s just a bug in iOS 10 beta 2.
* After receiving a message that their Apple ID account has been locked for security reasons, the prompt offers an Unlock Account option by way of verifying one’s identity, but it doesn’t work as intended. as iOS reports that the password cannot be reset due to “a server error”.
* Folks who took to @AppleSupport on Twitter have been told that Apple cannot reset their password because they’re using the two-factor authentication system.
* The official support document detailing two-factor authentication for Apple IDs acknowledges as much, clearly stating that “Apple Support can answer your questions about the account recovery process, but can’t verify your identity”.
* However, customers can request account recovery via this link, which kicks into action an automatic process designed to get them back into their account as quickly as possible while denying access to anyone who might be pretending to be them.
* “It might take a few days—or longer—depending on what specific account information you can provide to verify your identity,” explains Apple.
* It should be mentioned that this seems to have happened to some folks on the stable iOS 9.3.2 release as well as iOS 9.3.3 betas, according to posts on Reddit, so we cannot conclude with 100 percent certainty this is caused by the iOS 10 beta 2.
* Have you been affected by this and if so, what did you do in order to re-gain access to your Apple ID?
