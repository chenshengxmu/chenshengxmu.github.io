* Folks looking to fly Delta Airlines in the near future should checkout the company’s newly-updated iOS app. Fly Delta for both iPhone and iPad were updated today with support for Delta Studio, a free in-flight entertainment service for passengers on select Delta flights.
* The Delta Studio service is available on all domestic and two-cabin aircrafts, and gives passengers access to a number of TV shows and movies, as well as other content. And since the media is stored onboard the plane, there’s no need to pay for a Wi-Fi Internet session…
* Here’s how Delta describes the service:
* Now you can watch what you want, when you want — so stream away to enjoy a variety of movies and TV shows delivered straight to your laptop, iPhone®, iPad® or Android® tablet device. In-Flight streaming is a new service from Delta Studio available through Delta Connect or the Fly Delta App players (and be sure to download a player before takeoff to have more in-flight streaming time). The content is stored onboard the aircraft to insure quality streaming, and a Gogo internet session is not required to watch videos.
* Delta cautions that entertainment options vary by aircraft and route, but notes that it will keep up-to-date listings on its website for folks to check. It also adds that Business Elite, First Class and Economy Comfort passengers will get access to complimentary premium content.
* Other airlines offer similar packages. Australia-based Qantas has been using iPads for its in-flight entertainment service since 2011, and both Hawaiian and United Airlines recently launched their own services. If you want to check Delta’s out, you can find it in the App Store for free.
