* Apple device management firm Jamf yesterday announced an interesting collaboration with UC San Diego Health that strives to equip each of the 245 patient rooms inside the future Jacobs Medical Center with an iPad, an Apple TV and a big screen TV to create a better hospital stay and provide a range of features to patients.
* “UC San Diego Health is a prime example of a hospital leveraging mobile devices to transform what is possible in healthcare,” said Jamf CEO Dean Hager.
* “By combining the power of Apple, innovative healthcare apps and a robust management solution, hospitals can deliver the safe and secure patient experience we all deserve.”
* The iPad will be utilized as the control center of every room so that patients can access a range of features allowing them to:
* When a patient is discharged, the JAMF Pro app automatically and securely deletes all patient data from the device and prepares the tablet for the next patient.
* The app integrates with UC San Diego Health’s electronic health record system, called Epic, to coordinate iPad management with patient records. The system protects data from the prying eyes and is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.
* The 10-story Jacobs Medical Center building will have 36 intensive care rooms, 108 private rooms for cancer patients, 32 private post-partum rooms and 52 Level III neonatal intensive care rooms for critically ill newborns and families.
* The project is scheduled for completion later this year.
