* ClearBadges3DTouch10 is a great new release that lets you clear unwanted badge notifications from your apps by using a 3D Touch gesture on the icon. It adds a new option to your 3D Touch menus, as shown above.
* It’s a clever and creative way to utilize the 3D Touch gesture on any capable device, but even if you don’t have one, you can use a 3D Touch simulating jailbreak tweak to make this tweak usable on older devices.
* You can read our full review of ClearBadges3DTouch10 to learn more about how it works and how to use it on non-3D Touch devices.
* HideMeX – $2.99

* HideMeX is a fully-featured SpringBoard customization tweak for iOS 10 that lets you change the way your device looks in several different ways. The diverse options you can tinker with can make your device look totally different from everyone else’s.
* While it’s not as feature-heavy as Springtomize, it’s a good way to hold yourself over until Springtimize is officially iOS 10-ready.

* LockGlyphX (iOS 10) is a slick release made for iOS 10 devices that displays the Apple Pay animation any time you try to unlock your iPhone or iPad with Touch ID.
* The animation includes that of a fingerprint icon that fills in as your fingerprint is read and then a confirmation tick mark when it’s complete.
* It’s something that just looks aesthetically pleasing, and best of all, it’s fully themable so you can modify it at any time with other glyph packs or custom themes.
