* SoundCloud, a Swedish online audio distribution platform based in Berlin, today issued a refresh to its gorgeous iPhone and iPad application, in time for the summer.
* SoundCloud 3.10.0 for iOS now lets you play related tracks, shuffle liked tracks and audio files in your playlists, add or remove tracks directly from your playlists, plus share directly from the search screen and your list of liked tracks.
* You’ll notice a new Shuffle button at the top of your Likes screen. Just tap it to shuffle the favorites in your collection. As mentioned before, you can also shuffle your playlists.

* To shuffle the tracks in a playlist, tap the three dots next to any playlist and choose Shuffle from a new set of options.
* No longer do you have to log into SoundCloud’s web interface just to add or remove tracks in your playlists: tap the three dots on any track to open the options list and then add or remove tracks to curate your experience.

* And lastly, you can now play a related track in SoundCloud.
* First find a track of your choosing and then tap the new Play Related Tracks option. Developers claim that this feature takes advantage of SoundCloud’s improved algorithm to “create a long stream of similar content from the 100 million tracks on the service.”
