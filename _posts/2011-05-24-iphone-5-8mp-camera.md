title: iPhone 5 to Get an 8MP Camera?

* At this point of time, the question is not if the iPhone 5 will get an 8MP camera, but rather who is going to be the supplier. Earlier last month, Sony CEO dropped a bombshell by saying his company was going to work with Apple and provide them with camera sensors.
* Today, DigiTimes is reporting that one of their “sources” claim that Largan Precision, a Taiwanese manufacturer of camera lenses for various phone makers is expecting a large order from Apple to supply them with 8 megapixels modules…
* Taiwan-based Largan Precision currently sees 8-megapixel phone-use lens modules account for nearly 10% of its total lens module shipment volume, but it may see 8-megapixel modules replace 5-megapixel ones to become the mainstream for smartphones in the third quarter of 2011 due to possible orders from Apple, according to industry sources in Taiwan.
* As usual, it is impossible to confirm whether this information is true or not. Personally, I don’t care much about who’s making the camera lens, I just want to know that the iPhone will indeed get an 8MP camera, but knowing that Largan already supplies camera lenses for the iPhone 4, it wouldn’t be surprising if they provided lenses for the iPhone 5 as well.
* The iPhone 4 5MP camera does a great job, but let’s be honest here, there is still plenty of room for improvement.
* What do you think?
