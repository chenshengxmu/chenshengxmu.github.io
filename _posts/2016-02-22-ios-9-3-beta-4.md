* Apple on Monday released iOS 9.3 beta 4 to developers. The update is available for members of Apple’s develop program either via an over-the-air update, for those already on iOS 9.3, or as a standalone download from Apple’s developer center.
* Today’s release comes two weeks after the previous beta 3, which added  a new Wi-Fi Calling option for Verizon customers and a cellular fix for T-Mobile customers, and more than a month after the original 9.3 beta was pushed to developers.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with iOS 9.3 news, it’s going to be a significant update with several user-facing new features and improvements including Night Shift mode, password-protected Notes, new 3D Touch actions and much more.
* Redesigned Night Shift mode icon in Control Center:
