* T-Mobile USA, the nation’s third-largest telco and the only major U.S. carrier with no official iPhone offering, is allegedly looking to counter Apple’s rumored September 12 introduction of a sixth-generation iPhone and the subsequent September 21 availability.
* The word on the street is that the carrier is putting in motion its mysterious “iPhone Response — Phase 2” plan, scheduled for September 21 through October 1. If true, this new intel points away from a T-Mobile iPhone, just as Sanford C. Bernstein’s analyst Craig Moffett opined back in July…
* David Beren, reporting for TmoNews, the unofficial T-Mobile blog:
* Unfortunately, we have no idea what Phase 1 is or when or if it has already occurred, so our information on “Phase 2″ is even more limited.
* More importantly, we’re having a hard time believing anyone could see the joint evidence of T-Mobile preparing reps to sell against the product and preparing a “response” plan and still believe they will be announced as the last of the four national carriers to partner with Apple.
* The news report is based on the below image showing that the carrier is prepping their “iPhone Response — Phase 2″ for September 21 through October 1.

* The story arrives hot on the heels of yesterday’s report, also by TmoNews, saying T-Mobile is about to launch a “Bring Your iPhone to T-Mobile” campaign in an effort to bring unlocked iPhone customers into its retail stores.
* Though it has been buying some much-needed AWS spectrum from Verizon and testing its iPhone-friendly data service at WWDC, the Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier sadly remains the sole major U.S. wireless company lacking the iPhone presence.
* The Bellevue, Washington-headquartered carrier has nearly 40 million subscribers. Despite not being an official partner, T-Mobile USA sees a lot of business from unlocked iPhone users and they’re even offering support to unlockers.
* For example, it will be offering updated Micro SIM kits beginning August 29 to support unlocked iPhones on its refarmed 3G spectrum. At the same time, T-Mobile USA is telling its retail employees to sell against the iPhone.
* Hm, where have I heard that before?
* (AT&T, too, by the way).
* A T-Mobile USA engineer confirmed last month that his company hosts a cool million iPhones, stressing that Apple’s device is “a significant part of the modernization project”, adding that “once implemented, iPhones will work on U1900 at much higher speeds”.

* Beginning Wednesday, T-Mobile will start offering new unlimited, unthrottled data plans, unlike rival AT&T and Verizon which recently switched to shared data plans. These plans will work in conjunction with 4G data speeds, which in T-Mobile’s terminology means 3G HSPA+.
* Unfortunately, the carrier is behind AT&T, Verizon and Sprint in 4G LTE deployment. That being said, costly infrastructure upgrades is only half of the problem.
* Apparently, T-Mobile’s parent company is still looking to come to terms with Apple.
* As you know, doing business with Cupertino requires carriers to commit themselves to billions in upfront payments, a risk Deutsche Telekom is not willing to make, especially considering its financial woes and that failed merger with AT&T.
* Is T-Mobile going to land the iPhone this or next year, what do you think?
