* Apple’s Boot Camp utility, which allows Mac customers to boot directly into Windows, is getting an important update later today bringing full compatibility for Windows 10 to 64-bit Intel-based Mac notebooks and desktops.
* The update allows a wide range of Mac systems dating back to 2012 models to run Windows 10 natively, as opposed to running Microsoft’s operating system and OS X side by side using virtualization software like Parallel’s Desktop for Mac.
* Boot Camp 6 also includes updated Windows 10 drivers for the built-in SD or SDXC card slot, USB 3 slots, Thunderbolt I/O, the Apple keyboards, mice and trackpads, built-in or external Apple SuperDrives, as well as crucial drivers for the single USB-C port found on the new 12-inch MacBook.
* The following Mac models support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 when installed using the new Boot Camp 6 utility.
* You can identify your Mac model by choosing About This Mac in the Apple menu.
* To run Windows 10 on your Mac, you’ll need one of the Intel-based Mac models listed in the previous section. In addition, you’ll need to run OS X Yosemite and Boot Camp 6, which is available as an update within Boot Camp’s existing Windows partitions. The latest Boot Camp updated should also be available through the Mac App Store later today.
* Boot Camp 6 will download any necessary Windows 10 drivers upon upgrading to Windows 10 or installing a fresh copy of the operating system from scratch.
* And of course, you’ll need a copy of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 to upgrade to Windows 10 at no cost, or an authentic copy of Windows 10 if you plan on performing a clean install of Window 10 on your Mac.
* Windows 10 is available for $119 from the Microsoft Store as an ISO file download or in the form of a USB stick.
* Despite some teething issues, Windows 10 has largely received pretty favorable reviews following its release earlier this month.
* Will you be giving Windows 10 a whirl on your Mac?
