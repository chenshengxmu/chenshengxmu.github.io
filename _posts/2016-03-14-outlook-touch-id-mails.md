* After adding 3D Touch support for quickly viewing your calendar or composing a new event or email directly from the Home screen, Microsoft’s mobile Outlook app for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad has gained the ability to protect your emails, contacts and calendars within the app with your fingerprint, using Touch ID on supported iPhones and iPads. In addition, the Outlook 2.2.2 update packs in a few other refinements and enhancements.
* “You can now protect your inbox with Touch ID and get the privacy you deserve. Keep your messages away from prying eyes by requiring your fingerprint or device passcode in order to access your Outlook account,” as per release notes.
* To enable this feature, open in-app settings and then toggle on the Require Touch ID option under the app’s Preferences section.
* In terms of other enhancements, the pictures of attendees are now included below events in the agenda view. And there’s a nice little shortcut available, allowing you to press and hold a time slot to create a new event the in the day and three-day views.
* Grab Outlook for iOS at no charge in the App Store.
