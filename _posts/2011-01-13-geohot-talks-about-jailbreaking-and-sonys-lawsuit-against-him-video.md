title: Geohot Talks About Jailbreaking and Sony's Lawsuit Against Him [Video]
---
* Yesterday we told you about Geohot being sued by Sony for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3. Yes, even though jailbreaking your iPhone is legal, it still isn’t to jailbreak a PlayStation.
* Geohot was a guest on Attack of the Attack of the Show today. For a few minutes, you can see Geohot candidly talking about hacking, jailbreaking and more. This is not completely related to the iPhone but when someone like Geohot gets on camera, well, you just watch and listen…
* What do you think?
