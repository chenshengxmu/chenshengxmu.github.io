* iOS has at long last made it easy to share your iPhone voicemails with other people in Mail messages and Messages chats. Also, AirDrop lets you send voicemails to nearby devices and you can even save them as notes or voice memos. In this tutorial, you will learn how to share and forward your iPhone voicemails via Mail, Messages and AirDrop.
* To be clear, you don’t technically forward a voicemail from iOS’s stock Phone app to another voicemail app on your iPhone. Instead, sharing works by forwarding a copy of the voicemail file using iOS’s standard services, such as Messages, Mail and so forth, available in the multi-purpose Share menu.
* Step 1: Open the Phone app on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on the Voicemail tab at the bottom.
* Step 3: Select the voicemail message that you’d like to send to other people and then tap the Share icon in the top right corner of the app.
* Step 4: Select how you’d like to share the voicemail by tapping a share icon like Messages, Mail or Notes. Third-party apps on your device that accept audio files—such as WhatsApp, Viber and Documents—will appear in the Share menu, too.

* Step 5: Write an optional message and hit the Send button to share the voicemail using Messages, Mail or Notes. The voicemail gets sent as an audio file attachment in the M4A format.
* If the recipient has an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, they can press the in-line voicemail file to preview it with 3D Touch.

* While peeking at the voicemail, swipe up to Copy the audio file to the clipboard, Save it to Voice Memos or Forward it as an attachment via Messages or Mail.
* To share the voicemail with devices in your close proximity, tap the Share icon and select an AirDrop contact to share with. Make sure that AirDrop is set to Everyone in Control Center and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are enabled on both devices.

* Simply tap the Notes or Voice Memos icon in Phone’s Share menu to send the voicemail as an audio file to the stock Notes or Voice Memos app, respectively. Deleting a saved voicemail audio file in Voice Memos won’t remove it from the Phone app.

* The Phone app lacks audio editing options, but you can edit voicemails by sending them to the stock Voice Memos app using the Share menu. You can then use Voice Memo’s built-in audio trimming features to edit the audio, and then share it with others using Voice Memo’s share menu.
