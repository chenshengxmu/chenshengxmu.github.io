* Tweetie, a beloved Twitter client for the iOS and OS X, was first in many respects. It was first to introduce the pull to refresh feature, now a norm in iOS app design (even Apple borrowed it for iOS 6 Mail). The program set the tone for what a decent Twitter client should be long until TapBots’ Tweetbot came into full view.
* Tweetie was refined and refined until Twitter came along purchasing both iOS and Mac versions on April 9, 2010. And now its developer Atebits is back to iOS development with a game, another first for them. Called Letterpress and provided free of charge, it’s basically a word game with a simple, charming design and addictive concept that’s hard to put down…
* It’s “the perfect blend of fun and strategy”, writes Atebits.
* Letterpress introduces an interesting twist to the word game formula. Just as you’d expect, gamers must form words on the board, but asynchronous rather than turn-based gameplay really adds up to the addictiveness.
* Playing it with your friends using Game Center is even more fun.
* But why steer away from app development and venture into games?
* Enter Loren Brichter of Atebits, who told  The Next Web‘s Matthew Panzarino:
* It sort of just happened. I like that it’s in a totally different category than the things I did before. And it certainly doesn’t hurt that games have cemented themselves as the most popular category on the App Store (by a long-shot).
* I figured it would be a nice change of pace, and I’d learn something about a market that I’m completely unexperienced in, whatever the ultimate success of the app.
* MacStories editor Federico Viticci interviewed Brichter so check out his article for a little more background on what Brichter’s been up to since the Twitter adventure.
* You can grab your free copy Letterpress from the App Store right now.
* Let us know in the comments how you liked it.
