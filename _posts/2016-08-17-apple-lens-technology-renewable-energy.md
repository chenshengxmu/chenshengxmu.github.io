* Apple today issued a press release updating the public on its environmental progress in China while applauding its supplier Lens Technology, which in an unprecedented move has committed to utilize 100 percent renewable energy in all its glass production for the Cupertino firm by 2018.
* Lens will use wind energy to power its two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province which are used for Apple manufacturing. The move will avoid nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.
* This “unprecedented commitment”, in Apple’s own words, combined with zero waste compliance from all final assembly sites should help it lower its suppliers’ carbon footprint and reduce waste in China.
* Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through a power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple also said that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation.
* The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills.
* Lisa Jackson, Apple’s head of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, congratulated Lens for their “bold step” and expressed hope that its suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, “moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.”
* “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” she added.
