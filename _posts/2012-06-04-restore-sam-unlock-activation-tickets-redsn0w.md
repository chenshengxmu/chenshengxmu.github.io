* The latest version of RedSn0w now includes a new option nestled under the extras menu for restoring SAM unlock activation tickets. The iPhone Dev Team relates in the release notes that “you can now include your SAM tickets as part of your initial ramdisk jailbreak of iPhone 4 or earlier, or alternatively you can upload your SAM tickets to any device after its been jailbroken.”
* Previously, we posted a manual method to go about restoring your activation tickets, but this newer method is preferable due to its simplicity.
* Since the SAM ticket upload feature works universally with A5 and A4 devices, we suggest sticking with this method when it comes to restoring your unlock activation tickets. We’ve also posted a full video walkthrough; be sure to take a look inside…
* Note: First, your iPhone must be jailbroken, since this will transfer files to a native location in iOS. Secondly, in order to use this tutorial, you must have got in on the SAM unlock while the window was still open. You were also required to backup your activation ticket in order to restore it later.
* Step 1: Connect your iOS device to your computer.
* Step 2: Download and launch RedSn0w 0.9.12b1 or above.
* Step 3: Click Extras > Even more > Tickets and select your Lockdown.zip file that you created when you backed up your SAM unlock ticket. You can also just select the .plist file if you backed up your ticket manually.
* Step 4: You should see a message from RedSn0w saying that the Tickets uploaded.
* Step 5: Reboot your device, and try the SIM card associated with the ticket(s) that you restored.
* Are you currently using a SAM unlock? If so, what do you think about RedSn0w’s new easy restoral feature?
