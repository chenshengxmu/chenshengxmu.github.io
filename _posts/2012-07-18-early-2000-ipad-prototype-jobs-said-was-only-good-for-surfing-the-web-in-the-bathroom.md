* Wouldn’t you like to see what Apple’s earliest iPad prototype looked like? Now you can, thanks to NetworkWorld which uncovered a deposition by Apple’s design guru Jony Ive containing photos of a three dimensional mockup of a tablet that Apple produced as part of the discovery process some time between 2002 and 2004.
* It’s referred to as the 035 mockup and depicts a thick device made of plastic and without the physical home button. It’s a far cry from today’s iPad, but at the time must have been pretty futuristic. Looking at these pictures, we’re happy that Steve Jobs axed the tablet project a couple times due to weight, excessive power requirements and sluggishness exhibited by the early prototypes…
* NetworkWorld relays parts of Jony Ive’s deposition and quotes his response to questions regarding the 035 mockup.
* My recollection of first seeing it is very hazy, but it was, I’m guessing, sometime between 2002 and 2004, some but it was I remember seeing this and perhaps models similar to this when we were first exploring tablet designs that ultimately became the iPad.
* Asked whether the 035 mockup is a design he personally worked on, Ive said:
* It was the best of my recollection, this was a design that was modeled as a consequence of the way that we work, which is a team.
* Asked whether he recognized the 035 mockup as a mockup that the Apple model shop had produced, Ive responded:
* I actually don’t know which model shop made this, but I recognize this as a model that was produced during our exploration.
* Look Ma’, no home button on the face!

* And this is how Apple envisioned real-life use for this thick, bulky prototype.

* As MacRumors pointed out, drawings accompanying an Apple patent application from 2005 basically depict the same design, as seen below.

* The iPad of course influenced the tablet design as much as the iPhone defined the direction for all smartphones to come.

* Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs told journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher at the 2010 All Things D conference that Apple actually began work on a tablet prior to a smartphone project:
* I’ll tell you a secret. It began with the tablet. I had this idea about having a glass display, a multitouch display you could type on with your fingers. I asked our people about it.
* And six months later, they came back with this amazing display. And I gave it to one of our really brilliant UI guys. He got rubber band scrolling working and some other things, and I thought, ‘my God, we can build a phone with this!’
* So we put the tablet aside, and we went to work on the iPhone. 
* Nick Bilton reported last week for The New York Times that Apple’s early iPad prototype dates back to 2000 and was actually seven-inch, as the iPad mini is rumored to be.
* But the first tablet prototype Apple began developing in the mid-2000s had a seven-inch screen, said a former engineer at the company who helped build the smaller prototype and declined to be named to avoid upsetting people at the company today.
* Regardless of its size, Steve Jobs hated early prototypes.
* Mr. Jobs thought the device was too small and wondered aloud what it was good for “besides surfing the Web in the bathroom,” this person said.
* Jobs wouldn’t hesitate killing a bunch of early iPad prototypes that were ready for manufacturing, sending the engineers back to the drawing board.
* I imagine Jobs simply couldn’t envision people wielding such a bulky device with terrible battery life and unresponsive interface. The technology just wasn’t there yet and wouldn’t catch up until 2010, when the iPad came along.
* Good thing Apple had someone back then to make such important calls.
* Imagine what a shame it would have been had Apple released this prototype and it spectacularly flopped?
