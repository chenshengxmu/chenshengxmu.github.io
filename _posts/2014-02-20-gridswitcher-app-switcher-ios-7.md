* GridSwitcher is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows you to display the iOS 7 app switcher in a grid-based view. Most notably, you still retain the same app switcher functionality of the standard app switcher while in grid view.
* At this point in the tweak’s life, there are no options to configure how it works, just install it and start using it. Have a look at our video walkthrough of the tweak after the break.
* GridSwitcher allows you to use the same swipe-up gesture to dismiss apps in grid view. You can even dismiss multiple apps using multiple fingers—in this case up to four apps at once.
* On the iPad version of GridSwitcher, users are presented with a 3×3 grid to take advantage of the iPad’s extra screen real-estate. On the iPhone version, the grid is set at a 2×2 view.

* I anticipate that there will be many options added to GridSwitcher as the tweak matures, but as stated, the initial version will be devoid of any options at launch. You can expect GridSwitcher to touch down on Cydia’s BigBoss repo any day now for $1.50. Be sure to share your thoughts about the tweak down below.
