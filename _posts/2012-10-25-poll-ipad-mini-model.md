* Apple, as you know, starts taking pre-orders for the iPad mini tomorrow, October 26, through its online store in 26 different countries. Friday the following week, WiFi-only models are scheduled to land simultaneously on store shelves in 34 countries around the world with the WiFi + Cellular model arriving “a couple of weeks after the WiFi models”, according to Apple.
* You can place your pre-order for any iPad mini model, either cellular or WiFi-only, at midnight tonight. The device will also be available in the United States on carriers AT&T, Sprint and Verizon Wireless. The 16GB WiFi version starts at $329. The more capacious models each cost a $100 more than the previous one.
* Want 4G LTE capability? That’s a $130 extra versus its WiFi-only counterpart. So, which iPad mini is you?
* We’re asking people who decided to pass on the iPad mini to refrain from voting in order not to slant the results.
* Here, cast your vote now.

* Asked where the device should start at, about one-third of respondents told us that $199 was the magic price point and another third voted $249. Less then seven percent felt Apple could get away with a $329 iPad mini, which is exactly what the company priced the gizmo at.
* Another poll has seven out of each ten respondents saying they wouldn’t consider a non-Retina iPad mini. The iPad mini, of course, has the same 1,024-by-768 pixel resolution display as all iPad models prior to the third-generation Retina iPad.
* A poll we ran right after the announcement revealed approximately a third of respondents were disappointed with the device’s resolution, with another third saying they’d hoped the iPad mini would have been cheaper.
* Lastly, when we asked you yesterday if you were planning on getting one, four out of each ten respondents voted “Yes”.
* Feel free to explain your choice of iPad model down in the comments.
* As for me, I’m getting a 64 gigabyte white & silver model.
* I don’t need 4G LTE at this point because my current plan provides plenty of cellular data I can share with my other devices. Besides, I’ll jump on the LTE bandwagon this time next year, when telcos finally finish the commercial roll-out of this technology.
