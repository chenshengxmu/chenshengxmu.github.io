* I know, I know, Google runs the world’s greatest video streaming machine, YouTube, so why wouldn’t networks broadcast live TV there, no? Not so fast.
* For starters, Google might be interested in marketing a rumored live TV Internet service separate of its other offerings.
* Let’s also not forget Apple hasn’t had much luck persuading networks to license TV channels directly instead of going through operators.
* Be that as it may, the search giant is said to has been months into negotiating an over-the-top video service that would let customers stream live TV programming over the Internet, in turn totally bypassing cable operators like Comcast and Time Warner Cable.
* There’s no question cable-cutters should have a field day when, and if, Google’s live TV becomes a reality…
* Google in recent months has allegedly “made overtures” about the initiative to some programmers and in at least one instance has “provided a demonstration of the product,” according to a person who saw the demonstration.
* The Wall Street Journal has the scoop:
* Google Inc. has approached media companies about licensing their content for an Internet TV service that would stream traditional TV programming, people familiar with the matter say.
* If the Web giant goes ahead with the idea, it would join several other companies planning to offer such “over-the-top” services, delivering cable TV-style packages of channels over broadband connections.
* Though online video brands like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon offer on-demand TV, Google is reportedly focused on a game-changing deal that would allowing it to stream conventional channels, so folks could flip through them just as they would on cable.
* The article goes on to note that the existing ecosystem could be turned upside down if Google has its way. Due to the current landscape, cable-cutters are unable to, say, buy an online-only HBO subscription because the likes of Time Warner Cable that run the pipes don’t like being bypassed.
* The HBO Go iPad app.

* That’s exactly why watching ESPN or HBO Go on your Apple TV requires an existing subscription with a participating operator. Apple has been exploring various content agreements with major U.S. television networks for quite some time, to no avail.
* On a related note, GigaOM last week reported that Intel’s upcoming TV service dubbed OnCue (the name unearthed from Intel’s trademark sightings around the world) is going to launch by year’s end.
* With OnCue, the chip giant is apparently aiming squarely at traditional cable TV by augmenting live programming with a catch-up service and on-demand programming.
* The service will be available through a dedicated device, which the company is going to sell online as well as through traditional retailers.
* Intel hasn’t revealed the name of the offering yet, but the company has been quietly preparing to launch it under the OnCue brand.
* The Journal adds many media executives “are impressed at how slick Intel’s set-top box and guide are”.
* Meanwhile, Apple’s leadership continues to refer to the Apple TV as its hobby project. That’s despite the $99 device accounting for 56 percent of streaming set-top boxes sold – some “hobby,” indeed.

* Google’s existing set-top box initiative – dubbed Google TV and based around the Android software – has thus far failed to catch on with consumers.
* There’s also Google Play Video, YouTube (with some original programming and paid-for movies and TV shows) and Google Fiber so the search monster potentially has a lot to offer in this space, it just hasn’t figured out how to play its cards (yet).
