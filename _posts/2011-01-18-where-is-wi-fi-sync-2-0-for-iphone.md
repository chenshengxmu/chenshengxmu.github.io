* Back in the fall of 2010, we were promised a beta of the new version of Wi-Fi Sync by December. Here we are in 2011, and still the awesome wireless iTunes syncing app is nowhere to be seen.
* In a few recent tweets, the developer has announced that the app is still in development and should be available in two to three weeks. He also mentioned what some of these awesome features are, and from what I can tell, it will definitely be worth the wait…
* For starters, Wi-Fi Sync will work on all Apple devices, including the iPhone 4, the iPad and the iPod Touch 4G. It will also work over VPN and 3G, allowing a sync from anywhere. More importantly, the desktop client will have an off switch to allow us to restore our devices without frustrating errors.

* Apparently the client will run in virtual memory instead of modifying iTunes files. I’m curious if this delay is due to the upcoming CydiaSubstrate and Mac Cydia, since that sounds very similar to how Saurik described CydiaSubstrate.
* What do you think?
