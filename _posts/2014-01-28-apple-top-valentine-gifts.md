* It’s end of January which can only mean one thing: retailers are gearing up for the upcoming Valentine’s Day and Apple is no exception. Now available on the Online Apple Store and through the Apple Store shopping app for the iPhone and iPad (free in the App Store), the new ‘Top Valentine’s Gifts’ section has just launched sporting an Apple-currated selection of both its own products and third-party accessories for your significant other…
* Titled ‘Love is in the Air’, the new section predictable recommends buying an iPad Air or iPad mini with Retina display as a way “to your valentine’s heart”. Below is a quick look at Apple-recommended accessories, as seen in the Apple Store iOS app.
* Some of the highlights under the heading ‘Gifts they’ll love at first sight’ include the Nike+ FuelBand, Product RED cases, Marshall’s Stanmore Bluetooth speaker, the Anki Drive cars and lots more.

* There are no discounts – all products are full price.
* In line with past Valentine’s Day promotions, Apple is luring shoppers with free laser engraving and free shipping, with some caveats.
* For instance, to ensure gift arrival by February 14, all orders for the iPhone 4s/5s/5c and non-engraved iPad Air, iPad mini with Retina display, iPad mini and iPad 2 orders must be placed by February 5 when using the free shipping option.
* For guaranteed overnight delivery, you can wait until February 11.
* While engraved iPad Airs can be ordered by February 5 to qualify for free standard shipping, a laser-engraved iPad mini with Retina display, iPad mini or iPad 2 must be purchased by February 6 for free shipping.
* Apple provides similar deadlines for Mac, iPod and accessory purchases.
