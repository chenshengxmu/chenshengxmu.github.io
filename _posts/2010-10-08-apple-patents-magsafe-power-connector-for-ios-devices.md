* The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published an interesting continuation patent application from Apple yesterday. Apple’s patent says, “the connector 62 may be a power connector such as the MagSafe power connector manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. The MagSafe power connector utilizes a magnetic attraction to help retain a corresponding connector thereto.”
* Plenty of speculation could be made about what MagSafe charging means for iOS devices…

* The natural assumption is that Apple plans to abandon USB charging and syncing. Could Apple be working on implementing wifi-sync into the next major version of iTunes and iOS? I wouldn’t put it past them. If Apple implements wifi-sync, MagSafe would be the natural charging option for further unifying iOS into the entire Apple brand. Plus, MagSafe is just so much easier to use.
