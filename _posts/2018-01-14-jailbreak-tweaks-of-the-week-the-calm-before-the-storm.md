* It’s the calm before the storm in the jailbreak community as we await iOS 11 support for both Cydia and Mobile Substrate. That said, iOS 10 tweak development is stuck in somewhat of a lull as developers move forward with prepping their existing tweaks for iOS 11.
* In this roundup, we’ll outline the new jailbreak tweak(s) that showed up in Cydia this week.
* DebugTripAdvisor: Enables the internal debug settings inside of the Trip Advisor app (free via CydiaGeek’s repository)
* While the list isn’t impressively-long this week, try to maintain your patience. Things should kick back up again after iOS 11.1.2 gets a proper jailbreak with full Cydia and Mobile Substrate support. In the meantime, we’ll continue seeing sparse releases for jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks amid the slowness in the community as of late, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope. In the meantime, check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special from last week.
* We also have a plethora of dedicated roundups that can help you find new tweaks for tweaking your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
