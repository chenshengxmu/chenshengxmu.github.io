* Apple this morning sent out press invitations for a special event, set to take place on Monday, March 9th. The Loop shared the invite (shown above), which invites attendees to ‘Spring forward,’ and says it will be held in San Francisco at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.
* There’s no official word on what Apple will talk about during the event, but the consensus is the company will reveal further details about the Apple Watch. It’s also possible that Tim Cook and Co. could introduce rumored projects such as the 12-inch MacBook or iPad Pro.
* Unveiled last September, and scheduled to launch in April, there is still a lot we don’t know about the Cupertino firm’s highly anticipated wearable. Apple has yet to mention pricing beyond the starting price of $349, and has been fairly quiet regarding things like battery life.
* What we do know, however, is that the Apple Watch will come in three versions: Sport, Standard and Edition, and two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. It’ll support Apple Pay, app push notifications, fitness tracking, and a wide range of other functions, but it will rely on an iPhone.
* The last time Apple held an event in the spring was in 2012, when it introduced the third-generation iPad and Apple TV.
