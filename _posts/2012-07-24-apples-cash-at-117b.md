* Apple just announced its financial results for Q3 2012, and is now finishing up its earnings call. As promised, we’ve collected a list of some of the more interesting bits from the call to pass on to you.
* Among the list, is the fact that Apple added $7 billion to its growing cash pile last quarter, bringing its cash total to more than $117 billion. Also, there are now 410 million iOS devices in the wild…
* Apple’s overall iPhone sales and revenue numbers missed Wall Street’s projections, but the company says that it is still “extremely confident” in its strategy moving forward.
* The company also made sure to note that it has some “amazing new products in the pipeline.” And if recent rumors are any indication, we could see a number of those this fall.
