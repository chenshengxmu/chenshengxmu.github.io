title: Robin Williams Impersonates Siri as a Stereotypical Frenchman

* We love Robin Williams here at iDB. He’s just one of those comedians who clicks with us, and with a quick wit like his it’s hard not to laugh, especially when he’s working completely off the cuff.
* We also like Siri, so when you have one of your favorite comedians using Apple’s digital assistant in a gag, it’s always going to be something to spark our interest.
* When making an appearance on Ellen to promote his latest movie, Happy Feet 2, Williams ended up giving the audience the low-down on Siri in a way only Robin Williams can. The video is well worth watching, if just to watch Robin Williams’ genius at work.
* Ellen asks Williams about Siri at which point the comedian launches into a tirade, pretending to be a French version of the assistant we’re all coming to love.
* Williams himself recently admitted to being a fan of Apple’s iPhone 4S and Siri:
* “I’m fascinated by the new iPhone. I bought it and kept trying to use it in France. “Siri, what is a good restaurant?” (In a robotic voice.) “I’m sorry, Robin. I can’t give locations in France.” ”Why, Siri?” ”I don’t know.” It’s like she was upset with the French or something. “They seem to have an attitude I can’t understand. Should I look for Germans, Robin?”
* We knew Robin Williams was geeky – he named his daughter “Zelda” for heaven’s sake – but it’s great to hear he’s into his iPhones, too!
* It seems that he isn’t the only one, ether.
