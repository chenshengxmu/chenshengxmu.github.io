* This is interesting. Engadget has a screenshot of the UK Apple Store that shows iOS 4.1 scheduled to be released on Wednesday, September 8th.
* The US Website still shows the usual “Coming Soon” announcement so we’ll go out on a limb here and say that the 8th is the day. Any ideas on how this inconsistency of information happens?
* As usual when a new firmware comes out, make sure not to “accidentally” upgrade if you want to keep your jailbreak and unlock.
