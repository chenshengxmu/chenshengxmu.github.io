* Nearly nine months following its December 2013 debut, The Walking Dead: The Game — Season 2 by Telltale Games has reached its gripping conclusion with the release of the final chapter in the five-episode series.
* It’s titled “No Going Back” and available right now as a $4.99 In-App Purchase within the Walking Dead game, itself priced at $4.99.
* For those unfamiliar with Walking Dead: The Game, it’s based on the namesake comic book series by the Eisner Award-winning writer Robert Kirkman. The iOS title follows the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse.
* The penultimate episode titled “Amid the Ruins” became available a month ago, introducing new twists to the story of Clementine (with a cliffhanger ending).
* Telltale offers the following tease for the final episode:
* Winter is setting in. Time to find food and shelter is running out. And with a newborn infant to sustain, walkers are a greater threat than ever.
* As pressure builds and tensions reach breaking point, your choices will decide Clementine’s fate in the gripping conclusion of The Walking Dead: Season Two.
* Spoiler alert: the promotional trailer seen below offers plenty of hints regarding the final episode, as well as a recap of the major events from the previous episodes.
* Yesterday, the final chapter hit the Mac and Windows PCs and Sony’s PlayStation 3 and PS Vita consoles in North America. The edition for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PS Vita became available earlier today to fans in Europe.
* As we previously reported, Telltale is also prepping a brand new game based on AMC’s popular “The Walking Dead” television show. It’s titled The Walking Dead: No Man’s Land and set for release early in 2015.
* And, Telltale partnered with Skybound Entertainment and Zen Studios on an iPhone and iPad pinball game, The Walking Dead Pinball, which released yesterday in the App Store for $1.99.

* Walking Dead: The Game – Season 2 is $4.99 in the App Store.
* FYI: you don’t need to spend a dime on the initial download because Walking Dead is currently IGN’s Free Game of the Month, meaning you can download it for free by grabbing a promotional code on IGN’s promo page (the offer is available in 44 countries).
* The 532-megabyte download for the iPhone and iPad (iOS 6.0 or later required) includes the first chapter in the series, titled “All That Remains.”
* The remaining four episodes titled “A House Divided,” “In Harm’s Way,” “Amid the Ruins,” and “No Going Back” can be purchased within the game for $4.99 each. A one-time $14.99 season pass with all five episodes, a 25 percent discount, is also available.
* Have you played this game and if so, what did you think of it?
* And are you OK with chapter-based games that require you to buy new episodes?
