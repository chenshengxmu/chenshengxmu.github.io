* You might have noticed that your iPhone displays a spinner-like animation in the Status Bar whenever you access the internet or perform functions in specific apps. This spinner, which is commonly referred to as the activity indicator, lets you know that your device is actively doing something.
* For the most part, the activity indicator doesn’t get much attention, but a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed KITTLoader by iOS developer LonestarX gives it an entirely new look and feel.
* KITTLoader was created in response to a request thread on /r/jailbreak and replaces the traditional spinner with what looks like a ping-pong ball bouncing back and forth. The animated GIF below illustrates the animation in action:
* Once installed, KITTLoader adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure a host of options:

* Here, you can:
* The developer even includes a handy “Reset Settings” button at the bottom of the preference pane for restoring the settings to factory defaults whenever you feel like starting over.
* For the most part, KITTLoader is merely an aesthetic tweak that can make your activity indicator more fun and quirky at first glance, but it seems to have been positively accepted by the jailbreak community. That said, I too like how it looks and would recommend that you try it out if you are able.
* If you would like to try KITTLoader, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Bigboss repository. The tweak appears to work with all jailbroken devices running iOS 8, 9, 10, and 11.
