* With a new year always comes lots of new resolutions. The beginning of the year is also a great opportunity to make predictions on what’s going to happen. I am no Nostradamus but I’d like to share with you a few of my predictions for the iPhone in 2010.
* Apple will not divorce AT&T
* I know we all want the iPhone to be offered on more than just one network in the US (Verizon anyone?) but I doubt it will. As I said before, Apple has an exclusive agreement with AT&T and breaking it would cost too much.
* Fierce competition from Android
* Android will kick ass in 2010! I believe so much in Android that I am starting an Android blog soon. Oh and I am also getting the Nexus One as soon as I get back in the States. Apple knows that Google will give it all in this new phone, which is why Apple will have to step up its game.
* Improved battery life
* Let’s be honest, the iPhone battery sucks. We know it.  Apple knows it and they know they have to come up with a better battery for the next model.
* A 5MP camera
* There has been rumors that the next iPhone will be equipped with a 5MP camera. I believe this rumor is true. 5MP is still below the industry standards but it’s still better than the poor 2MP camera we have now.
* 64GB of storage
* This one is a no brainer. The next iPhone will come in either 32GB or 64GB of storage. That’s just normal evolution of things.
* A louder speaker
* What did you say? I said the new iPhone will have a LOUDER SPEAKER. Seriously, the sound on my iPhone is just pathetic. Once again, Apple knows it and will fix this.
* New design
* Let’s face it, the iPhone 3GS is just an intermediate product between the iPhone 3G and the next generation iPhone. Apple didn’t even bother giving the 3GS a facelift. I think 2010 will change. Be ready to see a breathtaking design for the new iPhone.
* No 4G for you!
* The name of the new iPhone will not be iPhone 4G. The iPhone will also not be 4G ready. Only a few markets offer a 4G cellular data network and it wouldn’t make sense for Apple to implement this at this time.
* 300,000 apps in the App Store
* It took a year and a half for the App Store to reach 100,000 apps. I predict it will take less than a year to reach 300,000. Everyone and your mom is developing iPhone apps now.
* Apps running in the background
* Just like they did with copy/paste, Apple will wait the last minute to give us this basic feature. They have to because all other major smartphones do it. I also predict Apple will rip off ProSwitcher and implement a very similar functionality in iphone 4.0.
* What are your predictions for the new iPhone in 2010?
