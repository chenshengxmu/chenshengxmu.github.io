* Fry’s, an American big-box store and electronics retailer, has beaten Walmart with a nice holiday discount on the iPhone 5. The entry-level iPhone 5 with sixteen gigabytes of storage and a two-year contract will set you back $126. That’s a buck less than Walmart and the lowest price we could find for Apple’s latest handset. If you’re in the market for a new iPhone, this could be the best deal yet to get your hands on the super fast, thin and light iPhone 5, arguably the best phone in the world…
* If you’re eyeing a more capacious iPhone 5 model, the 32 gigabyte version will run you $226 ($326 for 64 gigabytes of storage). Fry’s has both black and white model available and sales tax is added where applicable. Note this promotion is only valid in-store.
