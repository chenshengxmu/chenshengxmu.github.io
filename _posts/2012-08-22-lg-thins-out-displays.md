* We’ve heard several reports over the past few months that Apple is using a new, thinner display in its next iPhone. The tech is called in-cell, and will help slim down the handset.
* Interestingly enough, LG Display’s CEO Han Sang-beom announced today that his company has just started mass-producing a new line of thinner, smartphone display panels…
* Reuters reports on the CEO’s comments this evening, and it’s clear it believes that LG’s new display panels are going to be used in Apple’s next-generation iPhone.
* “Sources have told Reuters that the panels for the new iPhone will be 4 inches corner to corner — 30 percent bigger than current iPhones.
* The iPhone screens will also be thinner than previous versions with the use of so-called in-cell panels. The new technology embeds touch sensors into the liquid crystal display, eliminating the touch-screen layer found in current iPhones.”
* It’s worth noting that LG is a panel supplier for Apple, and the company was tapped as a next-gen iPhone display-maker by The Wall Street Journal back in May. So it’s possible that Reuters is spot-on, further confirming reports that the next iPhone will have a thinner, larger screen.
* As far as the specs of the displays, they’re said to have a resolution of 1136 x 640 and a PPI (pixels per inch) of 326. Essentially they’ll have the same width and PPI as the iPhone 4S.
* Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone at a media event on September 12. Pre-orders are said to start the same day, with the handset arriving in retail stores the following week.
