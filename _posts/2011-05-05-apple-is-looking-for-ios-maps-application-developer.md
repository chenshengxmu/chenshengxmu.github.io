* Are you the best navigation software developer you know? Do you love “innovative features” and “sophisticated user interfaces?” Then you may be what Apple is looking for.
* The folks at Cupertino have a new job posting for a talented iOS Maps Application Developer. Does this mean that we’ll see a revamped Maps app in the future?
* It’s been no secret that Apple has wanted to improve its native Maps application for quite some time, but not until recently have we actually seen evidence of things ramping up in the navigation department. Apple acquired two mapping navigation companies, called PlaceBase and Poly9, in 2009 and 2010.
* In a recent Q&A about the infamous location database, Apple stated that it was looking, “to build a crowd-sourced traffic database with the goal of providing iPhone users an improved traffic service in the next couple of years.”
* Apple currently uses Google’s backend for mapping and navigation data in the iOS Maps app. It will be interesting to see if Apple builds on top of Google’s infrastructure, or if it builds a totally revamped Maps app from the ground-up with its own technology.
* This job posting is similar to one discovered a couple months ago, so it’s obvious that Apple has big plans for navigation in the future.
* What do you think Apple will do with the Maps app? Will they abandon Google’s backend and rebuilt it from the ground-up?
