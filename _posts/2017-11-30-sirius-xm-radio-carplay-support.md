* After being quite the holdout, the popular Sirius XM app for iPhone and iPad was updated recently to include support for Apple’s CarPlay platform, bringing a bunch of radio channels to in-car infotainment systems that don’t support the app natively.
* Using the built-in display of your CarPlay-supporting vehicle, you can now tune to different radio channels, play on-demand episodes, view favorites and more.
* The app also recently got support for the new iPhone X.

* My car has Sirius XM integrated directly into the manufacturer’s user interface.
* However, the updated CarPlay app makes it much easier to navigate. You also don’t have to leave your CarPlay interface to switch stations as you would without it. The only downside is, of course, you would be using your phone’s data plan instead of the satellite your car utilizes.

* Earlier this year, we went hands-on with all the changes CarPlay brings with the iOS 11 software update, so give our video walkthrough embedded above a quick watch if you like.
* If you are a Sirius XM subscriber and haven’t tried the app, now is a good time to do so.
* You can find Sirius XM Radio on App Store for free.
