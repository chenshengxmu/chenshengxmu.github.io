* Apple has placed a straight-to-series order for the docuseries “Home,” reports Variety. Citing sources familiar with the iPhone maker’s plans, the outlet says the company has ordered 10, 1-hour episodes of the show, which offers a never-before-seen look at the world’s most extraordinary homes and their builders.
* The series will offer viewers a never-before-seen look inside the world’s most extraordinary homes, and delves into the minds of the people who built them. Apple has ordered 10, one-hour episodes of the new series.
* “Home” hails from executive producers Matt Tyrnauer and Corey Reeser of Altimeter Films, Matthew Weaver, Ian Orefice and Bruce Gersh from Time Inc. Productions, and Joe Poulin, CEO of Luxury Retreats. Tyrnauer also directs the docuseries. Altimeter Films, Time Inc. Productions, and Media Weaver Entertainment produce.
* This is just the latest move in Apple’s push for developing original content. The company recently announced it’s developing a drama series based on the book “Are You Sleeping” with Octavia Spencer, and it’s also working on a behind-the-scenes morning TV show drama with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.
