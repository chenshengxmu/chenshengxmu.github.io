* In addition to releasing the second major update to El Capitan and iOS 92 with  Safari View Controller enhancements, Arabic Siri support and other improvements, Apple this morning also posted a matching software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV.
* Marking the second software update since the new Apple TV’s debut in October of this year, tvOS 9.1 (build 13U85) is a bug-fix update which includes a couple of fixes for the most pressing issues reported by users.
* MacRumors reports that it features “improvements to networking and scrolling” and might include Siri search support for Apple Music, which was present in tvOS 9.1 betas.
* UPDATE: 9to5Mac has confirmed that Apple’s own Remote app now works with the Apple TV 4 and that Siri now works with Apple Music, meaning you can ask your box things like “What was the top song in 1995?” or tell it to “Play Adele’s latest single,” just like that.
* Depending on your settings, your set-top box should automatically prompt you to install the downloaded update, or it could automatically install it without user intervention. If you have opted to manually apply tvOS updates, go to System → Software Updates → Update Software on your device and the update prompt should pop up. To learn more about updating the Apple TV, check out this FAQ.
* Some users, myself included, are not seeing the update prompt yet, but this is expected in situations when changes are currently propagating through the Internet.
* The third-generation Apple TV and earlier are not supported by tvOS. We’ll update the article with other changes as soon as we encounter them.
