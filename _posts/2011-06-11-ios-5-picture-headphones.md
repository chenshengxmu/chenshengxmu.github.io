* We already knew it was possible in iOS 5 to snap a picture by pressing the Volume Up button, but iDB reader @MrSergioRamos now tells me you can also take a picture by pressing the Volume Up button of your iPhone headphones as well.
* Once again, this is not a killer feature, but a nice one to have, and a nice one to knowâ€¦
* Did you know about that trick?
