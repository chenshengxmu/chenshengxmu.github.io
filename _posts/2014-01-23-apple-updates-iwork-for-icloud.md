* Apple posted a major update for its iWork for iCloud app suite today. The web versions of Pages, Keynote, and Numbers all received a makeover with a flattened, iOS 7-inspired design, a handful of new features, and various other improvements.
* Among the new features is the ability to add passwords to iWork documents, and to share those password-protected documents with others. You can also now view a master list of iWork documents that others have shared with you, and more…
* Here are the change logs for each of the 3 web apps (via 9to5Mac):
* First introduced at WWDC last year, iWork for iCloud allows users to view and edit iWork documents using virtually any web browser. Today’s update brings the web apps more in line with their native Mac counterparts, with a touch of iOS 7 design.
* iWork for iCloud apps are available to all registered users for free through Apple’s iCloud.com web portal.
