* One of the things we see a lot of in the jailbreak community are tweaks that bring haptic feedback to the iPhone, and a new free release called Erie by iOS developer Sniper_GER follows in these footsteps.
* While most tweaks along these lines bring haptic feedback by way of screen taps, Erie takes a different approach by imposing haptic feedback whenever you press a button on your device.
* Out of the box, Erie supports the following actions:
* You can configure Erie in full from the tweak’s preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you get the following options:
* The developer includes a respring button in the preference pane so you can save any changes you make.
* Personally, I think it’s great how you can turn haptic feedback on or off on a per-button basis. The vibrations can be overwhelming if you repeatedly press the volume up/down buttons to get the right sound level or use Touch ID frequently. Conversely, it works great with the Home and sleep buttons because you don’t use these as often.
* If you use an iPhone 7 or an iPhone 7 Plus, then you already know what this feels like – you’ll get a small inkling of feedback as you press the button, and it feels similar (albeit not entirely identical).
* While the developer says Erie only works on devices with the Taptic Engine, I can vouch for the fact that it seemed to work just fine on my iPhone 6 Plus, which has a traditional vibrator motor instead. That said, it should work on any iPhone if it has a working vibration mechanism.
* Because I’ve always been a fan of haptic feedback tweaks, I’m inclined to say I like how Erie feels. Whether or not you enjoy haptic feedback will play an instrumental role in your choice to download Erie, but if you do, then I recommend giving it a shot.
* You can download Erie for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 iPhones, and the developer open-sourced the tweak on GitHub for anyone interested in learning about Erie’s inner working mechanisms.
