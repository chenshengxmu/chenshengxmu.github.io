* You know how Apple Pencil is weighted to prevent rolling and how it always stops rolling with the word “Pencil” facing upward on its metal band? Well, Apple’s attention attention to detail doesn’t stop at the stylus.
* Today, we have Apple’s brand new leather case for Apple Pencil put through its paces by our resident video editor Andrew O’Hara. In his hands-on video, Andrew finds that the case has been designed to prevent rolling and broken tips.
* And while you can put your stylus with the bottom part in first, it won’t be stuck inside the case because the body is soft: you just squeeze it down the tube until it comes out.
* And here it is.

* “This simple leather secures the cap, prevents it from rolling off your desk, and keeps the tip from being damaged,” says Andrew in the video.
* Apple’s case for Apple Pencil is available in Saddle Brown, Taupe, Midnight Blue and Black finishes. Priced at $29 a pop and currently shipping in 1-2 weeks, it can be grabbed from Apple’s web store. The price is a bit on the high-side, but then again—this isn’t an ordinary, sloppily designed stylus case.
