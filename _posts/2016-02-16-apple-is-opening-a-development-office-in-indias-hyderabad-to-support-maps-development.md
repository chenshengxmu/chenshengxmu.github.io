* The 1.25 billion people market of India is estimated to soon become the world’s top smartphone market and is already one of Apple’s most important markets despite the fact that the Cupertino firm is yet to open its first branded store in the country.
* But that’s not stopping Apple from investing in India. According to a statement Tuesday by an Apple spokesperson given to The Economic Times, the iPhone maker is opening a new $25 million development office in Hyderabad, where some 150 employees will be supporting Maps development.”
* “We’ve been investing to expand our operations in India and are thrilled to have passionate customers and a vibrant developer community across the country,” a PR person said.
* “We are looking forward to opening a new development office in Hyderabad that will be home to over 150 Apple employees supporting maps development,” Apple added. “The office will also have space for many contractors who will support our ambitious efforts locally.”
* Apple’s centre will occupy 250,000 square feet in Tishman Speyer’s WaveRock facility in the city’s IT corridor and is set to start in the latter half of this year.
* India is the world’s third market for smartphones and the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world. Apple’s revenue in India surged 38 percent in the holiday quarter versus the fourteen percent revenue rise recorded in Greater China, Apple’s second-largest market after the United States.
