* The QuickType predictive text functionality found in iOS 8 would be hard to mimic on a desktop interface that uses a physical keyboard, but Apple has come up with a good way to suggest words that you may want to type next in OS X Yosemite. Check out our video walkthrough after the break and see how.
* To use the QuickType-like feature in Yosemite, start composing a sentence, and press the ESC key on the keyboard to make OS X suggest the next word. In previous versions of OS X, you could use the ESC key to suggest a correction to a misspelled word, but in Yosemite, you can use the ESC to suggest a potential next word.
* Unfortunately, the scope of this feature is very limited. It only works in select apps, such as the Text Edit app. Nevertheless, it’s nice to know that such a feature exists, even if you probably won’t remember to use it, or if it doesn’t work with your text editing app of choice.
* What do you think about predictive text in OS X Yosemite? It’s a little half-baked, wouldn’t you agree?
