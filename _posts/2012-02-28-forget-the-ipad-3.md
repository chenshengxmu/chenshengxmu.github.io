* We know, we’re getting tired of all of the iPad 3 chatter today too. So we figured we would take a break from talking about that tablet, to talk about these tablets.
* The folks over at Aatma Studio, the creators of this awesome iPhone 5 mock-up, published a video today showcasing their new iPad 3 concepts. We’ve posted the video after the break, and highly recommend watching it. It’ll blow your mind…
* Wow. Holographic multiplayer video games? Multi-tablet widescreen videos? We can’t wait until this kind of technology becomes available in consumer products. Sadly, we don’t expect that to happen for several years. But here’s hoping that Apple is taking notes.
* What do you think of Aatma Studio’s concept video? Awesome, right?
