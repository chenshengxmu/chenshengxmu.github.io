* GoPhone, a prepaid wireless service from U.S. carrier AT&T, used to be a 3G-only affair. But not anymore.
* Just like clockwork, the carrier Friday announced that GoPhone customers can now enjoy fast data speeds not only on its third-generation HSPA+ network (unfairly billed as 4G), but also on the fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.
* Compared to 3G, 4G LTE offers ten times higher data throughput. The telco also added Samsung’s Galaxy Express to its GoPhone device portfolio and said folks can also bring their own HSPA+ or LTE smartphone…
* The refreshed GoPhone service includes the basic $35 a month plan with 500 minutes of nationwide calling, unlimited data and unlimited messaging and a a $50 unlimited talk and text plan, but with Wi-Fi data only.
* AT&T’s news release confirms they doubled the data available in the flagship plan: it now offers two gigabytes of data with unlimited calling/texting for $60 per month, with an option of adding a gigabyte more for an additional ten bucks.
* If you can cope with just 200MB of data per month, AT&T will happily sign you up for its $40 a month plan, which also includes 500 voice minutes and unlimited messaging. You’ll be paying five bucks per each additional 100 MB in this plan.
* And if you don’t need cellular data at all, AT&T will give you 250 voice minutes and unlimited messaging in exchange for $25 a month. Should you change your mind later in regards to data, $5 a month will but you 50 MB of data.
* All GoPhone monthly plans include international texts from the U.S. to Mexico, Canada and 100 other countries. These plans will kick into effect on June 21.
* This is a great option if you own an unlocked device purchased from AT&T as you’re not required to pay a deposit, sign a contract, put up with hidden fees or receive a bill – GoPhone is a pure pay-as-you-go service.
* AT&T continues expanding its LTE network, now live in 278 markets and covering 292 million people.
* For what it’s worth, Straight Talk offers unlimited everything for $45 per month. What Straight Talk doesn’t have is second-largest LTE network in the United States, also ranked as the fastest in a Rootmetrics survey.
* You should also consider AIO, another AT&T prepaid brand that launched last month, offering $40/$55/$70 tiers with unlimited talk/text and 250MB/2GB/7GB of data.
