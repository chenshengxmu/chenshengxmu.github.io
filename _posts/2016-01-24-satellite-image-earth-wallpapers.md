* Going all natural, today’s wallpaper selection contains satellite images of Earth. We found out galaxy wallpapers are extremely popular in the Wallpapers of the Week section, which led me to wonder, what if we looked the other direction?
* Featuring a website and dedicated app, WLPPR collects images from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency (ESA). Take a step inside for your downloads. 
* The images below were selected from a larger web gallery via the WLPPR website. Additionally, the self titled WLPPR app, contains a similar gallery and may be more easily uploaded to your device than the web.
* Wallpapers for the iDB Wallpapers of the Week section are collected from around the ‘Net or submitted by readers. If you have tips or submissions, find me on Twitter via @jim_gresham to share. To share images, make sure they are photo-quality and pre-formatted for the latest iOS devices.
