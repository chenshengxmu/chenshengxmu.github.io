* Apple has just seeded the first beta versions of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9. Registered iOS and Mac developers can log into Developer Center to access the betas, as well as release notes and other info. Apple says iOS 9 will be compatible with the same devices as iOS 8, so devices with A5 chips and newer should work.
* For those who missed the WWDC keynote this morning, Apple offered viewers previews of the future of both Mac OS and iOS platforms. OS X El Capitan brings about several under-the-hood improvements, as well as some nice new gesture and UI features, and iOS 9 includes a smarter Siri, better battery life and more.

* Both operating systems should see a number of beta releases over the next few months, as Apple prepares for a public release in the fall. We’re installing these initial betas now, so make sure you stay tuned to iDownloadBlog for more WWDC and iOS/OS X/watch OS coverage throughout today, and the rest of the week.
