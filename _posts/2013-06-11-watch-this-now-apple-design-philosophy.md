* Yesterday, we highlighted Apple’s mission-statement ad that deals with its famous signature, ‘Designed by Apple in California’.
* Today, the company has made WWDC commercials available on its YouTube page, among them a minute and 30 seconds long clip.
* The video is titled ‘Designed by Apple – Intention’ and Apple used it to open the WWDC keynote. In it, the company explains how it goes about designing its products so it’s definitely worth a watch from start to finish…
* “If everyone is busy making everything, how can anyone perfect anything,” says the opening line. “We start to confuse convenience with joy, abundance with choice.”
* The video’s central theme appears to be Apple’s focus on perfecting a few features that matter rather than confusing users with stuff they’ll rarely use. “There are a thousand no’s,” the video says in an obvious hint at Steve Jobs.
* Apple’s late co-founder used to say he was as proud of the things Apple hadn’t done as the things it had done. “Innovation is saying no to a thousand things,” Jobs told the WWDC crowd back in 1997.
* The video makes a smart use of simple phrases paired with elegant visuals to convey the thoughts and emotions that go into creating Apple products, have a look below.

* As a reminder, here’s the ‘Our Signature’ commercial.
