* A bug in Google’s YouTube app for iOS which caused excessive battery drain and overheating when watching video on your iPhone and iPad should be fixed in the latest update that’s now available on App Store.
* The YouTube team previously confirmed it was aware of this issue and working on a fix.
* “This is something we’re actively working on,” they wrote on Twitter last week. “Thanks for your patience.” Release notes accompanying YouTube’s version 12.45 note that this release has “fixed an issue with battery usage.”
* After updating to the latest version of YouTube for iOS, use it for a few hours then go to Settings → Battery to confirm that the app is no longer listed there as a battery hog.
* YouTube is a free download from App Store.
* Are you experiencing excessive battery drain when using YouTube for iOS?
