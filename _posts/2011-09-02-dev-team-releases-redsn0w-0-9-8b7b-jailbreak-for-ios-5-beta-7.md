* Hot on the heels of the release of iOS 5 beta 7, MuscleNerd announced on Twitter that he has updated RedSn0w to bring support for the latest beta firmware.
* Up until now, if you wanted to jailbreak iOS 5 beta 7, you had to point RedSn0w to beta 6. It worked, but it wasn’t ideal. By pushing RedSn0w 0.9.8b7b, the Dev Team makes things square, allowing you to jailbreak beta 7 by pointing the tool directly to beta 7…
* Additionally, MuscleNerd notes that he has made some improvements for iPhone 3GS owners with an older bootrom.
* “We’ve also added some overall improvements for old-bootrom 3GS owners (where the 24kpwn exploit applies):  on those devices, you can tell redsn0w to untether 4.3.5 and lower, or iOS5b7.  Old-bootrom 3GS owners can once again choose custom logos, and/or verbose booting (for the really nerdy iPhone3GS fans out there!).  And it allows 4.3.4 or 4.3.5 users to use ultrasn0w again (if they have a compatible baseband).”
* Finally, this version of RedSn0w also fixes some issues for Verizon iPhone 4.2.10 users.
* As usual, you can download the latest version of RedSn0w from our download section, and follow our RedSn0w guide to jailbreak.
* It’s important to note that this tethered jailbreak is mostly for developers, so stay away from it if you don’t want to mess things up on your device.
