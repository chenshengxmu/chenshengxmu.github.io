* As rumored earlier in the week, Apple has kicked off a new in-store iPhone upgrade program today. The company has put up signs and other marketing materials in its retail stores, and has begun emailing customers with older model handsets.
* The purpose of the event is to get those who still have an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s into a 5s or 5c, as Apple attempts to move remaining stock ahead of the fall’s anticipated refresh. The company has even upped its trade-in offers to sweeten the deal…
* 9to5Mac has the report:
* Apple is getting employees to check customers’ eligibility for an upgrade, inform them about the iPhone Reuse and Recycling program and push recently increased trade-in values for iPhone 4s and iPhone 4. Apple is now offering up to $99 for an iPhone 4 and $199 for an iPhone 4s. With that value put toward the purchase of a new iPhone 5s, Apple is promoting the deal as being able to upgrade to an iPhone 5s for as little as $0.
* It’s worth noting that there are a number of deals going on right now for new iPhones. Best Buy is offering 50% discounts on the 5s and 5c through the weekend, and both RadioShack and Target are running similar promotions (with contract of course).
* Again, the big push comes ahead of the next iPhone launch, which, according to recent reports, could happen as early as August. The so-called iPhone 6 is expected to be a significant update, with a new design and larger display likely to be in the cards.
