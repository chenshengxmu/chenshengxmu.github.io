* As mentioned, owners of the fourth-generation Apple TV can now have their device switch its display mode automatically to match a video’s native frame rate and dynamic range instead of forcibly upscaling everything to specific frame rates and HDR.
* TUTORIAL: How to use frame rate matching and dynamic range switching on Apple TV
* To turn frame rate matching on, open the Settings app, choose the section Video and Audio, select the sub-section Match Content and enable the option Match Frame Rate.
