* Most of us have had that dreaded moment when our iPhone slips out of our hands and goes flying across the room, crash-landing on the ground. If we’re lucky, the worst damage is a small ding on one of the corners. But, we’re not usually that lucky.
* Urban Armor Gear makes a rugged case for the iPhone 6s with high-level drop protection and reinforced corners for added safety when trying to avoid the unavoidable.
* The case is made from a hard composite shell with a honeycomb TPU interior. It is also fairly thin, relatively speaking, measuring just a scant 0.5 inches. The company claims the honeycomb structure helps provide added shock resistance, while keeping the case thin and light.
* There is a lip that raises above the iPhone 6s edge, which keeps the screen from being vulnerable to scratches while laying flat on a surface. There are also corner bumpers and rear skid pads, which give added grip while in your hand and extra protection if it slips out of your hand.
* Your iPhone 6s volume control buttons are protected from dust with heavy-duty covers, while the ports and speaker are exposed for easy access. They also have oversized cutaways, so you can easily plug in any type of cable or headphone.
* The case is certified to meet military drop test standards from four feet. It comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty.
* The Urban Armor Gear Case comes in a variety of colors and is available on Amazon for between $20 and $30, depending on your choice. There is also a version for the iPhone 6s Plus for between $30 and $40.
