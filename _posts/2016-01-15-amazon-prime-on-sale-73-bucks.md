* Amazon is currently offering a significant discount on its popular Prime service, cutting the one-year membership fee from $99 to $73. The promotion is in celebration of the company’s success at the Golden Globes earlier this week, and is good from  now through 11:59 p.m. Sunday night.
* For those of you who aren’t particularly familiar with Amazon Prime, the service includes a number of benefits. There’s free 2-day shipping (and same-day in some areas) on millions of products, and free access to Prime Video, Prime Photos, Prime Music and the Kindle Lending Library.
* You’ve probably heard of Prime Video. It’s Amazon’s Netflix-like streaming video service that allows users to watch a wide range of syndicated TV shows, movies, and original Amazon content like The Man in the High Castle. Similarly, Prime Music offers access to streaming radio and music.
* Honestly, these two features alone, in conjunction with the free shipping, would be worth the annual cost. But you also get unlimited photo storage via Cloud Drive, and one free rental per month on any Kindle device from a library of over 800,000 books courtesy of Amazon’s Lending Library.

* Amazon’s original series Mozart in the Jungle took home 2 awards at this year’s Golden Globes: Best Musical or Comedy Series and best actor in a Musical or Comedy Series for show star Gael García. That makes 4 total Golden Globe wins for Amazon, who also won two last year for Transparent.
* Again, the $73 promotion is for new members only and is good from now through 11:59 p.m. Sunday night. You can take advantage of the deal here. Additionally, Amazon is offering free access to Mozart in the Jungle this weekend, which you can find here or via the official Amazon Video app.
