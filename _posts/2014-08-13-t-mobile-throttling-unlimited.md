* It looks like Verizon isn’t the only carrier planning to throttle select unlimited LTE customers in the near future. A leaked internal memo surfaced today, confirming that T-Mobile will also begin slowing down the connections of some of its subscribers later this month.
* According to the memo, throttling will only apply to heavy data users that are using their connection for peer-to-peer file sharing and unapproved tethering. Like Verizon, the carrier claims the move is part of a larger effort to improve its overall network performance…
* Here’s an excerpt from the internal memo, provided by TmoNews:
* “T-mobile has identified customers who are heavy data users and are engaged in peer-to-peer file sharing, and tethering outside of T-Mobile’s Terms and Conditions (T&C). This results in a negative data network experience for T-Mobile customers. Beginning August 17, T-Mobile will begin to address customers who are conducting activities outside of T-Mobile’s T&Cs.”
* This only applies to T-Mobile customers on the old $70-per-month unlimited plan, or the new $80 Simple Choice plan. 4G/LTE data usage is already being capped with other offerings. For those that are on one of these plans, check out T-Mobile’s Terms and Conditions page.
* The move shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as Verizon and other providers have long been throttling their unlimited data users. T-Mobile has positioned itself as the ‘uncarrier’ though, so it’ll be interesting to see what its customers think of this very me-too carrier policy.
* Following Verizon’s throttling announcement last month, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler sent out a letter to the company asking for clarification on its initiative. He has since asked for thoughts from all US carriers on the matter, but it’s unclear if any further action will be taken.
* T-Mobile is expected to begin throttling customers on August 17.
