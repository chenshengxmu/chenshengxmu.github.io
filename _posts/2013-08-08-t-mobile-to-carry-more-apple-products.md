* I haven’t forgotten what T-Mobile said last December about selling Apple products in 2013. “T-Mobile USA has entered into an agreement with Apple to bring products to market together next year,” the carrier’s parent Deutsche Telekom wrote in a press statement back then.
* Four months later, the nation’s fourth-largest telco finally landed the iPhone and is now looking to add additional products to the mix. According to its outspoken CEO John Legere, T-Mobile is looking forward to carrying “a whole array of Apple product.”
* It’s kinda expected that T-Mobile should next start offering iPad and perhaps iPod touch devices as well. The way Legere framed it sounds like the company may be eyeing non-iOS gear, too, such as Mac notebooks and perhaps even Apple’s AirPlay wireless appliances…
* Ina Fried, reporting for AllThingsD, has a quote attributed to the T-Mobile CEO:
* I think there’s a whole array of Apple products that we look forward to carrying. We will expand what we offer from them.
* And expand they will, that’s for sure. Since landing the iPhone 5, the carrier has managed to revert the customer defection trend.
* During the June quarter, T-Mobile reported its strongest customer growth in four years, adding 685,000 branded postpaid phones, 1.1 million customers altogether and selling 4.3 million smartphones, a whopping 71 percent annual increase.

* Though it wouldn’t say exactly how many of those 4.3 million smartphones were iPhones, T-Mobile revealed the iconic handset accounted for approximately 29 percent of its branded gross customer additions and upgrade smartphone sales.
* A study by the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners has estimated that landing the iPhone saved T-Mobile from losing at least 300,000 customers as one out of each four customers said they were looking to jump ship before learning about the iPhone.
* Are you looking forward to checking out “an array of Apple products” at T-Mobile stores later this year?
