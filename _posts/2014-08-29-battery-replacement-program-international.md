* Apple started rolling out its Battery Replacement Program internationally today, offering free battery replacement for a subset of iPhone 5 devices that were sold between September 2012 and January 2013. The company notes that “a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently.” iPhone 5 users that are experiencing these symptoms can go to a dedicated page on the company’s website to check their device’s serial number and see if they are eligible for a free battery replacement.
* This marks the second and final phase in the roll out of the Battery Replacement Program, which was first initiated last week for customers in the US and China. Now open worldwide, the program allows any iPhone 5 found to be in the subset of defective devices to have its battery replaced at no cost.
* In order to check for eligibility, iPhone 5 owners should go to this dedicated website, select their country, and enter the serial number of their device. If eligible, users will be able to choose one of three service options to have their battery replaced. They will either be able to make an appointment at an Apple Store, or visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or contact Apple Technical Support.
* The company explains on its website that if an eligible iPhone 5 has damages that could impair the replacement of the battery, such as a cracked screen, this issue will have to be taken care of first, likely at the owner’s cost. If a user has already paid for a battery replacement before, and it was found that the device was eligible for a free replacement, then the user may contact Apple to get a refund.
* Finally, Apple notes that this battery replacement doesn’t extend the warranty coverage of the device. This program is open to affected iPhone 5 devices for two years after the date of purchase, or until March 1, 2015, whichever offers the longest coverage period.
