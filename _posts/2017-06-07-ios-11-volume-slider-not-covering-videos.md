* One of the most interesting changes in iOS 11 that hasn’t been talked about at all during Monday’s WWDC 2017 keynote is going to make a lot of you happy: the volume indicator on iOS 11 no longer obstructs the center of the screen obnoxiously.
* As noted by users on Twitter, the redesigned slider only appears when playing video in fullscreen mode. In other words, the good ol’ volume control centered on the screen isn’t going anywhere, it’s just that playing video in fullscreen mode replaces the standard volume control with an unobtrusive slider that sits in the top-right corner of the screen.

* This is actually part of a bigger update for iOS 11’s system video player.
* The iOS 11 video player has controls for subtitles (including YouTube’s auto-generated subtitles), AirPlay and more. Plus, it supports full keyboard control so you can control video playback with more than a dozen shortcuts via your physical wireless keyboard.
* iOS 11’s new minimalist volume slider does not appear in apps and on websites that implement their own custom video player. As an example, many video-streaming apps, including HBO NOW and Netflix, override the system video player and use a bespoke one.
* Google’s mobile YouTube app also recently updated its video player with a thin volume slider positioned unobtrusively at the very top of the currently playing video.
* iOS 11 is compatible with all 64-bit iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices. The software update will release as a free download to all customers this fall.
