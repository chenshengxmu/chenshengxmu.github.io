title: Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it
---
* Bloomberg published an article today about Samsung’s plans to release a device with a display that wraps around the edges. Why would you need such a feature, you may ask? As Van Baker, director of research at Gartner, explains, it’s all about throwing a bunch of s#@& against the wall and see what sticks.
* Curved screens may be a technology in search of a problem to solve, said Gartner’s Baker. Samsung may provide a test case because they have shown a willingness to release products into the market to see if they gain favor with customers, he said.
* “There are enough companies out there that are very fond of throwing whatever hardware they can out into the market, just to see if anybody will bite,” he said.
* Of course, Samsung will sell this to us as true innovation.
* By definition, innovation is the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, inarticulated needs, or existing market needs. Innovation must solve an existing problem, not just be a demonstration of what can technically be done.
* Just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should do it. But Samsung likes to prove it can be first. Not first at creating a new innovative product. Just first at creating a product.
