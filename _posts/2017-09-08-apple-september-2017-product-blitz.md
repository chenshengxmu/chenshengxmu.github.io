* With just a few days left until Apple’s big reveal on Tuesday, speculation as to what the company may or may not announce has pretty much approached fever pitch. Without further ado, this is what we expect at Apple’s landmark September 12 Steve Jobs Theater event.

* This is the easiest thing in the world to guess because Apple usually unveils new phones in September, barring a few exceptions. Aside from the iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus device with LCD screens and updated internals, most of the rumors revolve around the so-called tenth anniversary iPhone (the original iPhone debuted in 2007).

* Here are some of the key features we think are coming to iPhone 8:
* Aside from the aforementioned goodies, Apple may surprise us with a one more thing, a feature no one saw coming.

* If we had to make an educated guess, we’d say that perhaps the company would build on the tremendous ARKit momentum by previewing a dedicated augmented reality glasses for iPhone 8, which is rumored to arrive in 2018.
* The next Apple Watch won’t look radically different than Series 1 or Series 2, and we don’t expect it to get any thinner. That’s because Apple will add LTE connectivity, meaning it will have to squeeze more chips in an already tiny device. The band mechanism should not change in Apple Watch Series 3 so all your existing straps should work like a charm.

* While Apple Watch Series 3 might lack cellular phone calling at launch, this feature should be added later via a software update. Aside from cellular connectivity, expect increased dust and water protection, a faster Apple-designed S3 chip, updated display and touch technologies and maybe some new casing materials and color options.
* What to not expect from Apple Watch Series 3: a FaceTime camera.
* The fourth-generation Apple TV was released two years ago and it’s now overdue for update.
* The biggest news should be a major resolution boost to support 4K video output and several wide color video standards such as HDR, HDR10 and Dolby Vision to make it compatible with a wide range of HDR-certified television sets.
* Like wide color photography on the iPhone 7 series, HDR video brings higher contrast and a richer set of colors capable of reproducing finer detail than the traditional HD (1080p) standard. Apple is actually catching up to competition here because even Google’s Chromecast supports 4K while other media streamers, like Roku, also support HDR video.

* The upcoming tvOS 11 software update packs in only a few minor improvements, but Tim Cook hinted at WWDC 2017 that we’ll be hearing ”a lot more about Apple TV later this year”. What exactly that might entail is anyone’s guess, but we like to think that Apple may have a few surprises up its sleeve (for what it’s worth, Siri Remote is now on a serious backorder in many countries).
* For instance, the next Apple TV could also sport an all-new form factor, built-in Microsoft Kinect-like motion sensors and beefier graphics with a lot faster CPU with more RAM (to support console-quality gaming in 4K), but don’t quote us on that.
* As is its wont, the Cupertino giant during iPhone events usually announces precise release dates for its major OS updates. iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, watchOS 4 and tvOS 11 are all currently advertised with a vague release date “this fall”.

* New iOS updates always drop ahead of new iPhones and this time should be no different.
* That doesn’t mean all OS updates will release simultaneously: iOS 11 and watchOS 4 should hit on the same day (because Apple Watch requires a paired iPhone), but tvOS 11 and macOS High Sierra could arrive at a later date, especially if we’re looking at another event in October dedicated to the next Apple TV and maybe some new Macs (Mac mini, anyone?).
* As always, your guess is as good as ours and your opinion does matter.
