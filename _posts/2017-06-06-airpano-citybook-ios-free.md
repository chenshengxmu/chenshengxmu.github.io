* Just like City Book’s sibling app Travel Book ($4.49), it offers delicious views and angles on your favorite places in the world, which can be zoomed, panned and also experienced in a virtual reality mode. Moreover, each city accommodates a nicely presented City Guide comprising conventional tips on food and culture as well as more unorthodox talking points such as urban legends, lifehacks and more.
