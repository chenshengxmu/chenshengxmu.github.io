* According to well-connected blogger Mark Gurman, an aluminum-clad backplate that leaked yesterday pretty much matches the iPhones being tested internally. If true, this would be another indication that a sixth-generation iPhone will sport a metal back akin to the original model that launched five years ago…
* Gurman, writing for 9to5Mac, explains, citing “sources in position to know” who claim that:
* the structure of the shells do match up with what is being tested internally. Namely, the redesigned bottom portion of the iPhone with the moved headphone jack and smaller dock connector are present on at least one of the longer iPhones that Apple is testing internally.
* So, metal backplate.
* Is this what you expected from Apple’s next iPhone design-wise?
