* Following Staples’ lead earlier today, Target has updated its mobile app with support for Apple Pay payments. Those with compatible devices can now pay for everything in their carts with a single tap of Touch ID without having to signup for a Target account or enter credit card info.
* The update also brings about in-app product reviews, so you can see what customers think of their purchases. This is something every retailer needs to implement, if they haven’t already. as shopping trends continue to indicate that more consumers are researching before buying.
* Here’s your full 7.1 change log:
* This is a big update for Target, as it prepares for the busy holiday shopping season. Apple Pay support is important, as it lowers the barrier of entry for folks wanting to make purchases through the mobile app, and both mobile coupons and improved search are also welcome changes.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of the Target app in the App Store for free—you’ll need an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 to take advantage of Apple Pay. Also, be sure to check out our post on the deals Target will be offering on Black Friday.
* Thanks Matt!
