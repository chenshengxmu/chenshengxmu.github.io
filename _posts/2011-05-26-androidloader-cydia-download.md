* A couple days ago we told you about AndroidLoader, an upcoming jailbreak application that replicates the way Android lets you see all your apps on one single page. AndroidLoader is now available in Cydia for $2.99.
* Looking at the comments left on our previous post about AndroidLoader, it is my understanding that you guys wouldn’t find it very helpful and that it might be a bit overpriced for what it does…
* While I like the concept, I’m not sure about its implementation. I might have to wait for this app to be updated before giving it a try.
* Have you used AndroidLoader? What do you think?
