* As noted by Cult of Mac, AT&T has announced that it has added two more major markets to its high-speed LTE network. The carrier flipped the switch this morning for its next-generation network in both St. Louis and Staten Island, NY.
* The news comes just a week after AT&T activated LTE in Indiana and Bryan-College Station, Texas, reiterating its commitment to rolling out its long term evolution network to 12 new markets before the summer…
* AT&T now has LTE coverage in 32 markets — not bad for a company that just started rolling out its network a few months ago. The carrier says it expects its LTE deployment to be largely complete by the end of 2013.
* Make no mistake though, AT&T’s 4G coverag is still miles behind Verizon’s, who currently has LTE in over 200 markets. LTE coverage has become a major factor for folks buying Apple’s new iPad, as the Verizon model seems to be, by far, the most popular.
* And you can bet it will become an even bigger factor when an LTE version of the iPhone hits later this year.
