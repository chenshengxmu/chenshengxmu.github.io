title: Final Fantasy V hits the App Store
---
* Twenty years following its original release on SNES, Square Enix’s Final Fantasy V has landed on the iPhone and iPad. The game invites you travel the lands commanding a band of four in search for the mysterious crystals that control the four elements – earth, water, fire and wind – thereby bringing peace and prosperity to the world.
* These things have lost their power and are on the verge of destruction so you must find a way to restore their power. The iOS version also includes The Sealed Temple from the 2006 release, the Tetsuya Nomura-designed optional boss Enuo and an all-new soundtrack…
* Your heroes include Bartz and his chocobo companion, Princess Lenna of Castle Tycoon, the mysterious Galuf and the pirate captain Faris.
* You can customize each character to your heart’s desire, tapping the ability system to explore 26 unique job classes.
* Square has even tapped its resident character designer Kazuko Shibuya to recreate the characters and graphics for the best possible mobile experience.
* The game’s predecessor, Final Fantasy IV, became available on Apple’s mobile platform last December while Final Fantasy III landed on the App Store in March 2011.
* The universal binary download supports all form factor iDevices and is available now from worldwide App Stores, priced at $15.99 a pop.
