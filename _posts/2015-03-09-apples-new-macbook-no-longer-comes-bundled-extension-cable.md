* Sad news for those of you who use the power extension cable that comes with the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro: Apple’s newest addition to the venerable notebook line no longer comes bundled with said cable.
* That’s bad news for those of you who aren’t always in a situation where it’s easy to use plug the power brick directly into the wall outlet. It also means that your MacBook is now on a much shorter leash when it comes to charging.
* This change, coupled with the device’s lack of a MagSafe connector, could spell trouble for those of you who need to, you know, work while charging your MacBook. It seems to me like this combination would greatly increase the potential for an accident.
* But there is some good news in all of this. Apple will sell you an extension cable separately for only $19.00.

* This is the power adapter extension cable that goes from the Power Adapter to the wall outlet. It looks very similar to the power adapter that ships with the currently available MacBooks, but it no longer comes standard with the new MacBook. It will cost $19.00.
* To be honest, I’m having a hard time spotting any differences between this extension cable, and the one that currently comes with the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air. It says it’s currently unavailable, which indicates to me that it’s a new SKU.

* Older MacBooks come bundled with an extension cable
* Here are the other accessories that relate to the new MacBook’s power consumption needs. Although they’re not available now, these accessories will presumably be ready for sale once the MacBook launches on April 10th.

* This is a replacement USB-C cable for the one that comes bundled with the MacBook. Like the bundled cable, it’s 2 meters long. The USB-C Charge Cable will be available for $29.00.

* This is a replacement power brick for the one that comes with the new MacBook. It’s 29W, just like the bundled adapter, has a USB-C connection, and it will set you back $49.00 upon launch.
* So with all of this in mind, a fully equipped spare charger (minus the extension) would set you back $78 plus tax. That’s $1.00 cheaper than spare MagSafe chargers for previous MacBooks.
* What do you think about this news? Are you sad to see see the extension cable being sold separately?
