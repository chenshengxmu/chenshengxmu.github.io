* Apple may generously replace some iPhone 6 Plus models which may require a whole-device replacement with iPhone 6s Plus units through March of this year.
* According to an internal document distributed to Apple Authorized Service Providers last weekend, a copy of which was seen by MacRumors, the document says that “orders for whole unit service inventory of some iPhone 6 Plus models may be substituted to an iPhone 6s Plus until the end of March 2018.”
* From the article:
* Apple and most Apple Authorized Service Providers can replace an iPhone’s display, battery, speakers, rear camera or Taptic Engine individually, while a defective Lightning connector, faulty logic board and most other repairs are generally eligible for a whole-device replacement, our source said.
* The company does not specify which iPhone 6 Plus models are eligible.
* Notably, the company recently experienced a shortage of the $29 replacement batteries for the device until late March to early April so this may be the reason behind the new service policy.
* The publication got hold of another internal document stating that the company no longer manufactures iPhone 6 Plus units.
