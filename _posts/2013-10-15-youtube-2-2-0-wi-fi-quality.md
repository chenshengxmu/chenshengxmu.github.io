* Hot on the heels of its update to Maps, Google has rolled out a new update to YouTube which brings a much needed video quality option to the table. The setting, which is only applicable while connected to Wi-Fi networks, is ushered in along with the obligatory “compatibility” and “accessibility” improvements.
* This latest update brings the YouTube version number up to 2.2.0. The download is available on the App Store right now, and rings in at cellular network friendly 12.5 MB.

* To use the new quality settings, you’ll need to tap the vertical elipsis button that appears near the upper right-hand corner of a playing video. Once your do, the video will dim, and you’ll be presented with a settings cog icon. Tapping the cog will invoke the quality menu, and from there you can select from several quality settings.
* It’s also possible to continue using YouTube as is, and remain on the automatically adjusting quality settings, which is default.
* It should be noted that popular jailbreak tweaks like YourTube and ProTube have been allowing this for some time now. It’s a step in the right direction for the YouTube app, but it would be nice to have these same settings be applicable when watching video over cellular connections.
* What do you think? Are you happy to finally have quality settings available, even if it’s only available while on Wi-Fi?
