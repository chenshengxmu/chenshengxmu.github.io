* Making good on its promise, Apple has started stocking its U.S. retail outlets with cellular versions of the fourth-generation iPad with Retina display. According to web reports, Apple yesterday instructed its retail staff to stock these units and to wait until Mothership instructs them to begin sales because a launch date has not yet been communicated.
* By all accounts, the company should officially start selling these tomorrow, November 16. In a media release announcing opening weekend sales of three million iPads, Apple noted that cellular versions of both the iPad mini and the fourth-generation model will be available in the US on AT&T, Sprint and Verizon “in a few weeks”…
* News of LTE fourth-gen iPads hitting U.S. Apple Stores was first reported yesterday by Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac.
* Apple has begun stocking its U.S.-based retail stores with LTE versions of the fourth-generation iPad. The product is not on sale yet, but they could go on sale at anytime. Stores have been instructed to wait until word from corporate comes through to begin sales.
* Apple also earlier in the week has begun shipping first pre-orders of Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad mini, with some customers seeing delivery dates of this Friday, November 16, or even today, November 15.
* Does your local Apple Store has full-size LTE iPads?
