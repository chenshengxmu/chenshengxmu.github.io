title: Microsoft amps up Surface advertising with new ad titled 'Groove'
---
* Microsoft’s inaugural ad for the Surface tablet initially captured our attention, with its pro dancers performing all sorts of crazy moves with their tablets certainly helping a great deal with that. The software maker then followed up with the somewhat subdued teaser on the eve of Surface’s launch.
* On Cyber Monday, Microsoft has stepped up its game with a new television commercial seen above. It kinda looks familiar. Pretty sure I saw a similar concept involving jumping gadgets somewhere before…
* Regardless of your feelings toward the Surface, the ad is charming and effective, no?
* Or perhaps Microsoft should have considered a sensible marketing advice from a fan?
