* A recent survey of 70,000 US consumers by the American Customer Satisfaction Index shows that Apple is once again holding a comfortable lead in customer satisfaction over other computer OEMs.
* This won’t come as a surprise if you’re a Mac owner. Having made a complete switch from PC to Mac myself over a year ago, I can’t even fathom the idea of ever owning a PC again…
* According to Claes Fornell, founder of the American Customer Satisfaction Index:
* “In the eight years that Apple has led the PC industry in customer satisfaction, its stock price has increased by 2,300%. Apple’s winning combination of innovation and product diversification—including spinning off technologies into entirely new directions—has kept the company consistently at the leading edge.”
* Innovation and diversification might not be the only reason Apple ranks so high in customer satisfaction. If you ask me, this success is due to a mix of beautifully designed and engineered products, simple, and reliable products, topped by a clever marketing/branding strategy and outstanding customer support.
* Listen to me speaking like a fanboy!
