* Online retail giant eBay is celebrating its 20th anniversary today. To mark the occasion, the company has released a long-expected revamp to its iPhone and iPad bidding app in the App Store.
* For starters, eBay 4.0 for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, a free download, sports a revamped appearance along with an all-new app icon. At long last, the app is now universal and provides an easier access to top deals, promotions and events, “balanced with streamlined ways to access the powerful eBay features you’ve come to rely on.”
* The new experience offers a more customized, personalized and simplified way for eBay fans to browse, shop and sell. “eBay for iOS v4.0 is designed to simplify buying and selling, and place the best of eBay front and center,” notes the company.
* The new app learns from your interests to deliver a tailored shopping and selling experience based on activity. As the video embedded below attests, the app’s commonly used features like bidding and search are now featured more prominently than before.
* If you cannot see the embedded video, watch it on Vimeo.
* The app’s Home screen has been thoroughly redesigned and now offers three personalized channels:
* eBay 4.0 for iOS also offers more information to help first-time and new sellers be successful, with a new dashboard providing more regular sellers with at-a-glance activity updates.
* Like before, you can use eBay for iOS to search, bid, buy or make offers on unique items from sellers worldwide, list your own items for sale on eBay, use the built-in barcode scanner to find items, compare prices or start a new listing, receive push alerts about your eBay items and activity and more.

* Read eBay’s press release for the full list of features in the new mobile app.
* The 63.7-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. The app is fully optimized for native display resolution of the tiPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and includes a WatchKit component with an Apple Watch app for bidding directly on your wrist.
* The app is localized in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. eBay used to offer an iPad app as a separate download but it’s no longer found on the App Store following today’s release of the new universal eBay 4.0 software.
* Grab eBay for iOS at no charge in the App Store.
