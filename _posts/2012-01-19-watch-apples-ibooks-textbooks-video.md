* Apple has posted a promotional video for their recently launched iBooks Textbooks feature, and you can watch it right now.
* As you’re no-doubt aware of, Apple hosted a media event this morning in NYC to unveil their new education initiative.
* We’ve tried the iBooks Textbooks ourselves, and we liked what we saw. Now you can head over to Apple’s website to see a video of their new take on educating the masses via the iPad and iBooks.
* To view the video, hop over to this page on Apple’s website and enjoy. You will need Quicktime installed and enabled in your browser to watch.
* You can also view a full web page outlining their new educational plans and apps; it’s extremely verbose.
* How much of an impact do you think this will have on education in the classroom? Are you a student, if so, what are your thoughts?
