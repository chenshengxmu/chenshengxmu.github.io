* If you’re in the market for an iPad Pro and are considering purchasing Apple’s $99 Pencil or the $169 Smart Keyboard to take full advantage of the tablet’s new features for creatives and mobile workers, you’re in for some serious waiting as shipping times for these accessories have slipped to 4-5 weeks on the Apple Online Store.
* In a statement to Mashable, the company did acknowledge limited supply of the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard in its own retail stores and promised “regular shipments”.
* An Apple spokesperson told Mashable:
* Customers are very excited for iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard. We have limited supply of Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard in Apple Retail stores. Our stores will continue to receive regular shipments and we encourage customers to visit Apple.com for online availability and delivery dates.
* A quick look at the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil product pages on the Apple Online Store quickly reveals that customers are now faced with waiting times of four to five weeks. This is no doubt bad news for those who have pre-ordered their keyboard and stylus for use with the iPad Pro.

* In addition, the in-store pickup option is unavailable for these accessories. As for the iPad Pro, the 32-gigabyte entry-level model is listed with a shipping delay of four to five days. The 128GB Wi-Fi-only model is showing shipping times of 7-10 days, same as the flagship 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model which now appears sold out in some areas.
* Unlike the accompanying accessories, iPad Pros are for the most part available with in-store pickup in select areas.
* For a company well regarded for its supply chain efficiencies, it’s both surprising and disappointing to see them miscalculating demand for these essential accessories.
* Have you pre-ordered a Smart Keyboard or Apple Pencil yet?
