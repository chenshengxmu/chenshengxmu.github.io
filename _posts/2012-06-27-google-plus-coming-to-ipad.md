* It looks just gorgeous on that Retina display, Google’s Vic Gundotra said, just announcing a brand new native Google+ client for iPad. It’s coming “very, very soon” to Apple’s tablet and it’s available now for Android devices…
* The executive bragged about the app being snappy, seamless, beautifully designed (“this stream just feels great to use”) and demoed a few features and remarked how “actions are not just prominent, but playful”.
* “Hangouts enables a kind of intimacy that’s not possible on other devices”, Gundotra said demoing a multi-video chat.
* Here’s what Hangouts in the Google+ for Android app look like.

* You can pin videos, swipe left and right to see who’s in room and it’ll automatically switch view to focus on the person doing the talking and more.
* Other features include brand new Google+ Events with deep integration with Google Calendar, enhanced notifications, brand new profiles and what not.
* According to Google:
* Inviting someone to your home, your wedding or your favorite restaurant is a deeply personal act. You’re handpicking who’ll be in the room, after all, so invitees should feel part of something special. That’s why Google+ Events offers meaningful ways to build and send beautiful invitations.
* Here’s how beautiful the invitations can be.
* The new Party mode is interesting, letting a bunch of people take photos and automatically share them with members of a certain event (i.e. weddings, parties, etc.). All photos get uploaded and stored in the same place, sorted in chronological order, with comments, face tags, profile links and everything you’d expect.

* Here’s Party mode in action.
* Gundotra also updated us on some important Google+ metrics.
* Google’s social thing now has 250 million users worldwide, a quarter of Facebook’s billion active user base. Over 150 million users are active at least once a month, and fifty percent of them sing in daily and spend approximately twelve minutes on average in the Google+ stream.
* Way more information is available in a post over at the official Google blog.
* Do you use Google+ at all?
