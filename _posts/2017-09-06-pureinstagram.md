* Instagram tries to display ads in your feed as non-intrusively as possible by designing them in such a way that they look like regular Instagram posts. Nevertheless, some people just hate seeing them in every capacity.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak called PureInstagram by iOS developer snakeninny, you can hide these seemingly-harmless ads from Instagram for good.
* The tweak starts working from the moment you install it, leaving you with an uncluttered news feed that only contains posts from the accounts you choose to follow.
* With no options to configure, PureInstagram mitigates confusion and gets right to the point, proving to be the perfect solution for those who are frustrated with ads showing up in the Instagram app.
* Because the tweak alters the Instagram app, we recommend closing the app via the App Switcher and restarting it after you’ve installed the tweak from Cydia to ensure a seamless experience.
* PureInstagram can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices with the latest version of Instagram (13.0) installed. If you don’t already have Instagram installed, it’s a free download from the App Store.
* If interested in learning about what makes PureInstagram tick, the developer open-sourced the code for the tweak on GitHub for public viewing.
* Are you happier using Instagram without any ads popping up in your news feed? Let us know in the comments below.
