* Apple released iOS 5 Beta 6 to developers last Friday, and the latest beta software has already been jailbroken with Sn0wBreeze. The Dev Team has now released RedSn0w 0.9.8b6 “Jetblue Edition” for a tethered jailbreak on iOS 5 Beta 6.
* iOS 5 Beta 6 is one of the last beta verisons expected to be released before the final GM build of iOS 5 next month.
* We’ve released redsn0w 0.9.8b6 to jailbreak iOS5 beta6 (point it directly at the beta6 IPSW).
* Two important notes about this version:
* Due increased sensitivity to abrupt filesystem shutdowns in IOS5b6, it’s very important that you do a clean shutdown before running redsn0w.
* Click here to learn about what’s new in iOS 5 Beta 6.
* Make sure to follow the Dev Team’s above instructions if you do plan on jailbreaking iOS 5 Beta 6. In a nutshell, no boot logo support, and you should power down your iPhone completely before proceeding to ensure a clean jailbreak.
* RedSn0w 0.9.8b6 is available on both the Mac and PC, and you can find both versions in our downloads section.
* To learn how to jailbreak with RedSn0w, refer to our tutorial. The steps haven’t changed; just make sure to point RedSn0w directly to the iOS 5 Beta 6 IPSW.
* For Windows users, Sn0wBreeze will allow you to jailbreak Beta 6 without a registered developer UDID. All beta versions of Apple software are intended for developer use only, however.
* Have you taken the plunge yet, or are you waiting it out for the inevitable untethered jailbreak once iOS 5 goes public?
