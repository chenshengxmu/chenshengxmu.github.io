title: 'RSSWidget' Brings Your Favorite RSS Feed to Notification Center

* Notice I said favorite RSS feed, and not feeds. Yes, RSSWidget works great, but it’s ridiculously restrictive when it comes to the number of feeds you can have.
* In fact, you can only have one feed. Besides that obvious limitation, RSSWidget is a decent little Notification Center jailbreak widget. Check inside as we take it for a spin on video…
* RSSWidget works wonderfully, but it’s much too limited to be a viable RSS option. Perhaps there will be a more fleshed out premium version in the future. At this point, I’d have to call it nothing more than a concept, though a good concept it is.
* If your device is jailbroken, and you want to give it a try, head over to the BigBoss repo on Cydia.
* What do you think?
