* The list of additions in iOS 5 seems to get longer by the minute. While Apple’s WWDC keynote stated that there are over 200 new features in the upcoming software update, Scott Forstall and company only touched on 10 of them.
* The remaining 190+ features are left for developers and beta testers to stumble upon, as everyone else awaits the software’s official release this fall. The latest find seems to suggest that iOS 5 will give users the ability to capture panoramic photos…
* Apple discussed the updates to the Camera and Photo applications at the developer’s conference, but they didn’t mention anything about a new panorama mode. Luckily, the folks over at 9to5Mac were able to uncover the feature buried deep within iOS 5 code.

* Though this doesn’t give us much to go on, it does hint that Apple is at least toying with the idea of allowing users to capture panoramic photos from the stock Camera app. But besides the code, there’s currently no other evidence of the feature in iOS 5.
* There are several 3rd party applications that enable users to snap wide-angeled photos, typically by stitching together multiple snapshots – it’s a tedious process. It would be interesting to see how Apple would implement the technology in iOS.
* What do you think? Are your fingers crossed that this feature shows up a future release?
