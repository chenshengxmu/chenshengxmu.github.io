* Shawn “Jay Z” Carter has banded together a formation of artists looking to take on the music streaming industry with Tidal, the music streaming company he bought for $56 million. With fierce competition from Spotify, Google, Rdio, and soon Apple, Jay Z has put together an elite list of artists that want the value of music to be recognized again. The group detailed their plans at a media event on Monday evening.  
* “The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value,” Jay Z told the New York Times. “Water is free. Music is $6 but no one wants to pay for music. You should drink free water from the tap — it’s a beautiful thing. And if you want to hear the most beautiful song, then support the artist.”
* Jay Z’s version of Tidal will have two subscription tiers: $10 per month for a compressed format and $20 per-month for CD-quality streams. There is no free, ad-supported membership like offered by other services. Tidal offers more than 25 million tracks and apps across all systems, including the web.
* Artists Jay Z has on board as part owners includes Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Jack White, Deadmau5, Daft Punk, Usher, and others. The group hopes to have a music streaming service that benefits both the consumer and artists. The star-studded announcement is available to view on Tidal’s website.
* In recent years, artists have spoke out about not making much money from the streaming industry. Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify in the fall. Jay Z calls the current system “criminal.” TechCrunch reports Tidal is paying out twice as much to artists.
* With Tidal, Jay Z hopes to garner subscribers by offering exclusive content before any other service – similar to Beats Music’s original plan. The New York Times says Jay Z is courting new artists to join the service by offering Tidal special material and “windows,” or limited periods of exclusive availability.
* Still, even with exclusive content, Jay Z and his band of artists have a battle ahead of them. Before Jay Z purchased Tidal from Swedish technology firm Aspiro, it had 512,000 paying users in the fall. Spotify, in comparison, has 60 million users, with 15 million of them paying.

* Business Insider took a look at the current version of Tidal, and found it to be wonky. Jay Z didn’t detail if Tidal will see a user interface revamp for the web and mobile apps to take on other services.
* It’s been reported Apple has plans to unveil a revamped music streaming service later this year, with exclusive content also in its focus. Does Tidal stand a chance?
* You can give Tidal a try on its website with a 30 day free trial.
