* Wow, that was fast. The iPad mini hasn’t landed on store shelves yet and already Amazon has removed a comparison ad on its home page which painted the device in unfavorable light to its own Kindle Fire HD tablet. I guess they didn’t like mostly raving  reviews that describe the device as being beautifully constructed, fast, fluid and hard to resist – price be damned. Or perhaps alarms were raised at Amazon when another report suggested that Apple’s marketing boss clarified that the iPad mini does have stereo speakers where in Amazon’s ad claimed it didn’t? What goes around comes around, Amazon…
* Reviewers noted that the iPad mini has two separate audio channels found on the bottom of the device, to the left and right of the Lightning port. Prior iPads only had one speaker on the right of the bottom I/O port, including the latest fourth-gen model. Of course, hooking up external speakers or headphones to any iPad produces stereo sound.
* People of Earth: Apple confirms iPad mini has STEREO SPEAKERS. As I note in my review.

* Previously, a quick visit to Amazon’s homepage would yield this Kindle Fire HD vs. iPad mini comparison.

* That ad is nowhere to be seen now.
* Maybe Amazon planned all along to have it up briefly to make some noise about its Kindle Fire HD. Or, they may have concluded that the ad isn’t really working.
* Be that as it amy, you’d be hard-pressed not to connect the dots and conclude that the online retailer figured it should prevent a backlash stemming from falsely claiming that Apple’s tablet has a mono speaker.
* What’s your take on the situation?
