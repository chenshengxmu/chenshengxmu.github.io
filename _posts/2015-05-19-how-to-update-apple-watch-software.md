* The very first Apple Watch software update launched today, bringing Watch OS from version 1.0 to version 1.0.1, this update, as we reported earlier, is a fairly significant upgrade to Watch OS, and every Apple Watch owner should update.
* But since no one in the public has ever updated an Apple Watch prior to today, you may be a little hesitant to update due to being unfamiliar with the process. Don’t worry, as we have you covered. In this walkthrough, we’ll show you how to update your Apple Watch from A-Z.
* Note: Make sure that your Apple Watch is in range of its paired iPhone
* Step 1: Charge your watch to at least 50%
* Step 2: Connect your watch to the inductive charger
* Step 3: Launch the Apple Watch app on your paired iPhone
* Step 4: Tap My Watch
* Step 5: Tap General
* Step 6: Tap Software Update to check for a new update
* Step 7: If a new update is found, tap Download and Install (enter your iPhone passcode if requested)
* Step 8: Tap Agree on the Terms and Conditions page and the software will begin downloading to your Apple Watch
* Step 9: Tap Install once the update is downloaded to the watch to start the installation process (enter your iPhone passcode if requested)
* Note: Be patient, as the update take about 10-15 minutes or so to complete
* Once your device is updated, go back to Apple Watch → My Watch → General → Software Update in order to see if you’re on the latest Watch OS firmware.
