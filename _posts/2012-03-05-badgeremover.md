* If you’re looking for a way to remove your app notification badges in one fell swoop, there are many options to do so. Just search for “badges” in Cydia, and you’re bound to come up with a few options for suppressing those annoying badges.
* And then there are tweaks like Springtomize 2, which removes badges, along with about a million other functions.
* But if you just want a tweak that will silence your app badges, and nothing else, then there’s a new option called BadgeRemover…
* BadgeRemover requires no configuration, and has no options in the Settings app; it’s a strictly install-and-go affair.
* You can download BadgeRemover for free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo.
* What do you think?
