* Apple just seeded iOS 8.4.1 beta 1 to members of its developer program. Seeing that this release is a minor version release, there’s a good chance that it contains bug fixes, and perhaps even a fix for the exploits used in the iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4 jailbreaks.
* While details are currently scarce about what the update contains—there are no release notes at this time—we’ll be sure to update you once we gather more info.
* The iOS 8.4.1 beta 1 release comes in with a build number of 12H304, and is available for all devices capable of running iOS 8.4.
* If you’re a jailbreaker, you’d be advised to stay away from this beta release, although you can almost certainly downgrade back to iOS 8.4 if the need happened to arise.
* This update comes along at the same time as the OS X 10.10.5 beta for the Mac. You can find this update and the OS X update on the Apple Developer Center.
