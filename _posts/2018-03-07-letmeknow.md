* If you make and receive phone calls on a regular basis, then you may have something to gain by installing a new free jailbreak tweak called LetMeKnow by iOS developer Kiran Patil.
* LetMeKnow provides iPhone users with an ounce of haptic feedback whenever a phone call connects or disconnects. It works regardless of which party disconnects the call, and it can prevent you from having to plaster your phone to your face until someone picks up your outgoing calls.
* In some cases, you can become unknowingly disconnected from calls while using speakerphone or CarPlay because it becomes harder to hear the audible tone your iPhone makes when a call ends. In these instances, LetMeKnow becomes a powerful asset for understanding everything that happens during a phone call.
* Personally, I’ve had problems in the past where I call a customer support line and get disconnected after an extended hold or while being transferred from one representative to the next. LetMeKnow can be useful in these scenarios by better communicating the call disconnection with the user and ensuring that you won’t stay on the line waiting for nothing.
* LetMeKnow doesn’t have any options to configure after installation. It begins working immediately after installation and the only way to disable the tweak is by uninstalling it from Cydia.
* If you’d like to augment your iOS calling experience with LetMeKnow, then you can download the tweak for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Citing the Cydia description, it works only on jailbroken iOS 11 iPhones, such as those pwned with CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2.
* Do you think LetMeKnow will streamline your calling workflow? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
