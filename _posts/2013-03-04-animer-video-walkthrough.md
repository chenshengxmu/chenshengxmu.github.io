title: Animer video walkthrough
---
* We’ve already done a written review of Animer, but now it’s time to bring you our traditional video walkthrough. Animer, as we already told you, is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to add different styles of animation to the app switcher, banner notifications, and the HUD. It’s available for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and if you’re viewing this from an iOS device, you can click here to be taken directly to the Animer page on Cydia. Be sure to let us know how you’re digging it in the comments section.
