* Facebook’s annual developers conference, F8, is underway this week and the social networking firm just announced that its mobile Messenger app is gaining a new tab to help users find their recently used bots, nearby places and businesses to message. Titled Discover, the new tab has started to roll out to a few people in the US today ahead of wider availability.
* “We wanted to find a way to make it easy and simple for people to find the businesses they care about in Messenger,” wrote Facebook in explaining why it built the new tab. The Discover section lets you see what’s popular, featured or nearby.
* You can also see and browse broader set of categories like News, Entertainment, Finance and more, or tap the search field to find exactly what you are looking for.
* Developers can apply to have their bot included in the curated tab.
* As part of the F8 conference, the social network also unveiled all-new chat extensions for Messenger, with Spotify integration available at launch and Apple Music arriving soon.
* To stay in touch with the latest from F8, be sure to check out the official F8 website, download Facebook’s F8 app for iPhone from App Store or add the F8 bot from within Messenger.
* Facebook Messenger is a free download from App Store.
