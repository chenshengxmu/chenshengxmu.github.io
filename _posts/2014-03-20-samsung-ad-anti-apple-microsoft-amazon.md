* Samsung’s just posted a new ad to its YouTube channel inviting viewers to “do more” on the new multi-tasking Galaxy Tab Pro series tablet, featuring three different scenes dedicated to bashing Apple’s iPad, Microsoft’s Surface and Amazon’s Kindle tablets. The ad is actually humorous, which is a refreshing change change for Samsung.
* The commercial’s anti-Apple scene envisions sending email on the Samsung tablet while on a video call, using snapping two apps side by side. Have a look at it after the break and tell us what you think in the comment section…
* Another scene features a girl asking a dude to move his tablet a little bit, to which he fumbles with a Surface and keyboard cover in his hands.
* Here it is.

* I actually love the part where four girls chat about a book until one pulls her Galaxy Tab Pro to check out a video on YouTube, her friend remarking she can’t do that on her Kindle, to which the Samsung woman sarcastically quips, “What can it do?”
* Also: notice how the Samsung woman disses the iPad’s “Retina thingy”.
* “So, your Samsung looks better than my iPad because it has got more pixels?”, a woman asks.
* “Right,” her friend responds.
* “But mine has got the Retina thingy,” the iPad owner argues.
* As a reminder, the iPad’s “Retina thingy” maxes out at 2,048-by-1,536 pixels versus the Galaxy Tab Pro’s 2,560-by-1,600 pixel resolution.
* I love good advertising as much as the next guy and Apple bashing has been a recurring theme for Samsung so this ad is a continuation of the series which started 2 years ago.
* I don’t find the commercial insulting or in bad taste.
* Remember, Apple’s successful Mac vs. PC ad series, which similarly called out the Windows giant, didn’t mince any words to portray the Mac in positive light.
* What did you think of this ad?
