* Two days ago, French blog NowhereElse.fr passed along a batch of photos of an alleged iPhone 6 dummy unit that appear consistent with earlier mockups, photos of supposed cases, molds, front panel parts, schematic drawings and more.
* “Evidence” – and I use the term loosely – seems to point to an ultra-thin device with a slim 6mm body with various physical changes such as a relocated sleep/wake button, redesigned volume buttons and so forth.
* Give the video included after a break a watch and join us in the comment section…
* The video below was first shared on the Chinese technology blog 86Digi and reposted by Steve Hemmerstoffer of NowhereElse.fr [Google translate]. It’s said to depict a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 variant with a thin 6mm profile, as evidenced before.
* The biggest takeaway: a pair of antenna cut outs on the back.
* According to a source, this is because Apple has adopted a three-stage aluminum design for the iPhone 6’s back, corroborating a recent Macotakara report indicating that the company is in fact getting rid of the current glass antenna windows found on the iPhone 5/5s.
* Other things shown off in the clip seem to match up with previous reports. For example, the sleep/wake button has been relocated to the top right side, presumably to enable users to wake up the device easily while holding the phone in a hand.
* The volume buttons on the left side are now rectangular rather than circular, matching up with a photo that was posting on the MacRumors forum on Monday.

* Note that the model shown in the video has a circular LED flash on the rear rather than a pill-shaped design on the iPhone 5s, prompting speculation that Apple may have found a way to build dual-LED flash as a single component.
* Also, the back camera module is flush with the chassis, versus the purported production images that have pointed to a camera bulge on the back.
* The iPhone 6 is said to come in two sizes: a 4.7-inch variant that could have the same 640-by-1,136 pixel resolution as the iPhone 5s so all existing apps could run out-of-the-box and a 5.5-inch phablet with a full HD resolution of 1,920-by-1,080 pixels – or higher.
* The phones are expected to be powered by Apple’s in-house designed A8 chip and include an eight-megapixel camera on the back with a wider f/1.8 aperture and software-based image stabilization, in addition to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, a slimmer chassis and more.
* The larger iPhone 6 was apparently pushed back into 2015 because Apple’s battery cell suppliers LG Chemical and Samsung are apparently having issues producing thin battery components measuring 2mm or less.
* Again, the video shows a dummy iPhone 6 unit that spread across the blogosphere two days ago. It actually looks like a 3D printed model and should not be confused for a genuine Apple part so take it with a pinch of salt.
* That said, what do you think?
