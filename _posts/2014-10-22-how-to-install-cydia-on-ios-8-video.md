* As you know, the Pangu jailbreak came out this morning and enabled the ability to jailbreak iOS 8-8.1. Unfortunately, the jailbreak wasn’t bundled with Cydia, so it’s not much use to the general jailbreak users by itself.
* Thankfully, Saurik quickly compiled a working version of Cydia for iOS 8, which is pretty easy to install if you follow our 8 steps. We show you how in this hands-on video walkthrough.
* Step 1: Jailbreak iOS 8
* No items found.
* Step 2: Install OpenSSH on your device from the Pangu app
* Step 3: Download and install CyberDuck SFTP client
* Step 4: Find your iOS device’s Wi-Fi IP address via Settings → Wi-Fi → ‘i‘
* Step 5: Launch CyberDuck and connect to your iOS device’s IP address
* Step 6: Download the needed Cydia files, and place them on your iOS device via CyberDuck
* Step 7: While CyberDuck is open, click Go → Send Command and paste the following command and click Send: dpkg --install cydia-lproj_1.1.12_iphoneos-arm.deb cydia_1.1.13_iphoneos-arm.deb Step 8: Click Go → Send Command again, and type reboot and click Send. This will reboot your iOS device.
* Upon reboot, you should see the Cydia icon on your Home screen. Launch Cydia to initialize and enjoy your new jailbroken iPhone with Cydia!
* What do you think? Did this work for you? How does it feel to have Cydia running on iOS 8.1?
