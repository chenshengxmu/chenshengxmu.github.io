* Apple slipped a minor update under the radar with a few new additions to their Apple Watch band and iPhone X case lineups. It includes three new silicone band colors, and three new silicone iPhone X cases.
* On the Apple Watch front, we have Flash Sports Band, which previously was only available as a Sport Loop style. There is also the Spicy Orange Sports Band, which previously existed as an Hermés exclusive. Lastly, we have the Dark Teal Sports Band.
* The other changes we saw were to the iPhone X Silicone Case.

* The changes largely mirror what we saw on the Apple Watch bands. Both Flash and Spicy Orange are now available, as well as Cosmos Blue. Cosmos Blue has been around for a little while as a leather case option, and now is available as silicone as well.
* Of the new colors, which ones is your favorite? Do you think you will be picking up a new colored case or watch band? Why don’t you let us know down below!
