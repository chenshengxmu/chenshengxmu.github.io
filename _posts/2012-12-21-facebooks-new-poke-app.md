* Facebook is building up quite the app library on Apple’s mobile platform. There’s the official app, and then there’s several subsidiaries like Camera, Pages, and Messenger. And today we’re adding another one to the list.
* This afternoon, Facebook has announced the release of Facebook Poke, an app that, as you might have guessed, allows you to ‘Poke’ your friends, by sending them a quick message, photo or video. More details after the fold…
* Facebook explains the purpose of the new Poke app via a blog post:
* “With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you’re up to in a lightweight way. You can poke an individual friend or several at once. Each message expires after a specific time you’ve set, either 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When time runs out, the message disappears from the app.”
* And that’s really all there is to it. It’s kind of a strange release actually, considering how limited the feature is. You would think that, if nothing else, Facebook would have just added this feature to the actual Facebook app.
* But nevertheless, it’s here. And who knows, maybe this will become a big hit. After all it’s essentially the same thing as SnapChat. If you would like to check it out for yourself, you can find Facebook Poke in the App Store for free.
