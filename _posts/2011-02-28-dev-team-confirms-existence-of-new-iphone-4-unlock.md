title: Dev Team Confirms Existence of New iPhone 4 Unlock
---
* Following up on the report we brought you last night concerning the status of an iPhone 4 Unlock, the Dev Team has essentially confirmed those reports today.
* @MuscleNerd, an integral member of the Dev Team, tweeted today that along with an iPhone 4 unlock, an unlock might also be possible for the 3G and the 3GS on some of the newer basebands.
* The good news is that he went on to say that “[the iPhone 4] is 1st priority…”

* Judging from the tweets listed above, it looks like the rumors are true, and that we can expect an unlock on the horizon any day now for iPhone 4’s running basebands 3.10.01 or 2.10.04. They are even working on an unlock for 04.10.01 basebands for 4.3b3 firmware.
* As you’ve probably heard, the unlock will likely come after the release of iOS 4.3, as @MuscleNerd stated earlier in the year.
* It’s getting closer and closer to reality folks, all of you with iPhone 4 paper weights will soon be able to rejoice!
* Are you pumped, or what?
