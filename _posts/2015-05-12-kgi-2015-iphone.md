* Revered KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo arguably has the most prescient track record in forecasting Apple’s plans. In a note issued to clients Tuesday, obtained by MacRumors, Kuo makes a number of predictions regarding the next iPhone refresh, many of which have already been rumored, but some never heard before.
* He is expecting ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ handsets to be powered by Apple’s next-generation A9 processor with 2GB of RAM, twice as much as the current iPhone lineup. The RAM will be of a speedier LPDDR4 variety versus the LPDDR3 RAM in current iPhones. More RAM coupled with a faster, more power efficient processor, should result in smoother performance and better multitasking.
* The camera is likely to receive a pixel upgrade and should be twelve megapixels while Force Touch pressure sensitive screen will be “the biggest upgraded selling point”.
* However, the analyst warned that force sensing could also prove one of the main bottlenecks of the supply chain, potentially limiting the next iPhone’s availability at launch.
* Nevertheless, Force Touch can enhance user experience due to “more input methods and support of handwritten signatures, which is beneficial for expanding in the commercial market”.
* He doesn’t see a brand new four-inch model, as previously rumored, because 2015 iPhones will remain at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, like the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, respectively. Also, screen resolution will remain unchanged from the current-generation iPhones.
* He’s expecting a new casing color, rose gold, “matching the rose gold Apple Watch Edition”. Assuming Apple resolves drop test issues, fans can also expect “a limited number” of 5.5-inch units with sapphire screen protection.
* There should be an additional microphone near the speaker to enhance voice quality and the controversial bending issue will be addressed “by using different casing materials and internal mechanical design changes.”
* He is likely talking about Series 7000 aluminum, the same aluminum flavor used for the Apple Watch Sport casing. Apple claim its Series 7000 aluminum is approximately 60 percent stronger than the material used in current iPhones.
* A more accurate Touch ID is also in the cards, as is “gesture control support.”
* Mass production of the handset should kick off in mid-to-late August, in time for a presumed fall launch. The analyst is project total shipments in the range of 80-90 million units in 2015, with a 2:1 ratio of 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models.
