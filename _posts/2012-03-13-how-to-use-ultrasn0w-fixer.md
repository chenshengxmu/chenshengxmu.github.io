* When Apple released iOS 5.1 last week, the update didn’t just break the previous jailbreaks. It also broke the software unlock for the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 known as Ultrasn0w.
* While this may not be a very big deal to most people, it’s rather inconvenient for folks who need to use their iPhone on multiple networks. Luckily, a temporary fix has surfaced in Cydia known as Ultrasn0w Fixer. And even luckier, we’re going to show you how to install it…
* Before we get started, you’ll want to make sure your handset is on one of the following basebands: 01.59.00, 04.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.13.01, 05.12.01, 06.15.00. You can check this by going to Settings > General > About > Modem Firmware.
* Your must also make sure that your device is jailbroken and running iOS 5.1 (click here for our tutorial on how to do that).
* Now, onto the tutorial:
* Step 1. Ultrasn0w Fixer isn’t in a default repo, so you’ll have to add it. To do this, open up Cydia > Manage > Sources > Edit > Add, and type in the following URL: http://repo.iparelhos.com.
* Step 2. Once the repo is done loading, search Cydia for Ultrasn0w Fixer. Locate it and install it like a typical package.
* Step 3. After the Fixer is done installing, you need to grab the latest version of Ultrasn0w. This is in a default repo, so all you have to do is search for and install it.
* And that’s all there is to it!
* Keep in mind that the jailbreak for iOS 5.1 is tethered and a bit unstable. It’s also worth noting that the Dev Team is expected to release an updated version of Ultrasn0w in the near future — so we recommend waiting for that if possible.
* Any questions?
