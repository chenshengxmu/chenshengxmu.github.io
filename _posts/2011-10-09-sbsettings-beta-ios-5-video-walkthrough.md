* Without a doubt, SBSettings is the de facto must have tweak among all jailbreak tweaks for the iPhone. I think if you took a poll of 100 people, 90 of them would claim that SBSettings is the one tweak that they could not live without.
* With that being said, imagine my excitement when I heard that the iOS 5 beta version of SBSettings was ready for testing! I’m happy to report that it comes with tons of new settings, and beautifully integrates into iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* Check inside for a full video walkthrough of the new and improved SBSettings…
* There are a few bugs that need to be squashed, mainly revolving around the power options, and the Notification Center dock option. But this is beta, and bugs are expected.
* As of now, SBSettings is totally usable and functional on iOS 5 GM, and I highly recommend it to anyone running a jailbroken iOS 5 installation.
* To access the beta version of SBSettings, add the following repo to Cydia: http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/
* What do you think about the new SBSettings? Are you as excited as I am? Let me know in the comments section below.
