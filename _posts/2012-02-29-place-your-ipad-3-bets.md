* After months of rumors, Apple has finally confirmed that there is a new iPad on the way. The company sent out media invitations yesterday to what we can only assume is its iPad 3 event next week in San Francisco.
* At this point, you might feel like you know everything about Apple’s new tablet. The Retina display is practically a sure thing, as are improved processors and higher resolution cameras. But are you confident enough about these predictions to put money on them?
* Apparently, there’s quite a few folks that are. So SkyBet has decided to take advantage of them. As noted by 9to5Mac, the gambling branch of the UK’s Sky network is now accepting bets on which features will make it into the new iPad.
* As you can see in the above image, the folks at SkyBet have obviously been keeping up with the latest iPad 3 rumors. But if you put enough money down, you could still turn a nice little profit — if that sort of thing is legal in your area.
* Do you think you know enough about the iPad 3 to bet on it?
* UPDATE: SkyBet took the page down. No more betting on the next iPad.
