* As with all of Apple’s major software updates, macOS Mojave includes a number of privacy and security enhancements. Among them is a new feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which essentially makes it more difficult for data companies to track users.
* “Data companies are clever and relentless,” Apple says, pointing out that when you browse the web, your device can be identified by little things like fonts and plug-ins. Thus it’s taken steps in macOS Mojave to make your particular device look like everyone else’s.
* In Safari, enhanced Intelligent Tracking Prevention helps block social media “Like” or “Share” buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. Safari now also presents simplified system information when users browse the web, preventing them from being tracked based on their system configuration.
* Safari now also automatically creates, autofills and stores strong passwords when users create new online accounts, and flags reused passwords so users can change them. It also has new data protections that require apps to get user permission before using their Mac’s camera or microphone, or accessing personal data like user Mail and Messages history.
