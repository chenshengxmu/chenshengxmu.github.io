* Gene Munster is out this weekend with an earnings preview for Apple, which is slated to announce its Q4 financials on Monday. The Piper Jaffary analyst sees the company reporting big numbers, and has them at a $640 price target.
* But perhaps more interesting in Munster’s note is that he says he expects the iPhone 6 to be out next summer—months before the now-usual September refresh. He thinks it’ll feature a larger display, and is going to be a “blockbuster.”
* BusinessInsider has the note:
* “But even more important than the 5S, says Munster, is the iPhone 6, which he expects to be out in the Summer, sooner than expected. The 6 is going to have a bigger screen, and Munster thinks it’s going to be a “blockbuster.”
* Enthusiasm about the iPhone 6 should more than offset any concern about 5S sales inevitably slowing, says Munster.”
* In addition to a larger iPhone, Munster is also calling for an iWatch next year. He believes Apple is currently working on a wearable electronic device, possibly a wristwatch, that will seamlessly pair with other iOS devices for convenience.

* It’s worth noting that Gene Munster is the same guy that has been beating the proverbial ‘iTV drum’ for more than 2 years now, with zero results. The analyst has, on several occasions, wrongly predicted the arrival of a full-size Apple TV set.
* That being said, outside of his crazy ‘summertime’ launch date, his iWatch and iPhone predictions line up with a number of recent reports. The Wall Street Journal, DisplaySearch and other credible outlets have made similar forecasts.
* Despite the fact that Apple is having a huge fall, its 2014 is shaping up to be even bigger. In addition to an iWatch and larger iPhone, the company is also expected to unveil all-new Apple TV hardware, and possibly a larger 13-inch iPad.
