title: Introducing the HiPhone 4G
---
* Ladies and gentlemen, please let me introduce you to the HiPhone 4G… A Chinese knockoff never looked that good! Starting at about $100, the HiPhone 4G is probably as close as you will get to an actual iPhone, while saving you a few hundred bucks in the process.
* Wifi, dual SIM, TV, FM radio, dual camera, this thing is the real deal. Not only the hardware looks similar but they also replicated the iPhone iOS (in a much worse way though). Check out the pictures below…
* Ok, we’re real far from the quality of the iPhone’s Retina Display, but for a hundred bucks, you don’t get too complain.

* My favorite feature of them all? The freaking antenna! If you don’t get 25 bars on this thing, then there’s something wrong.

* Available at Light in the Box… What’s your thoughts?
