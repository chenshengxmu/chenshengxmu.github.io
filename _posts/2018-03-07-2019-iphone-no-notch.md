* A new report out of Korea suggests that Apple’s next iPhone X update will feature a smaller TrueDepth camera resulting in a smaller notch, too, with 2019 models potentially removing the notch entirely.
* ET News reported Wednesday that Apple is working on a brand new iPhone design where the screen would completely fill the front of the device, ditching the notch entirely.
* “Apple decided to get rid of the notch design starting from 2019 models and is having discussions with relevant companies,” an unnamed industry source told the publication. To achieve a design where a display fills the front of the device completely, Apple will need to find a way to put the whole TrueDepth camera system behind the screen.
* Given that 2019 iPhones are expected to feature Face ID, the infrared transmitter and receiver, the infrared camera and other sensors will still need to be present… somewhere. The report goes on to note that some display experts think that Apple could drill physical holes in the OLED panel for the sensors or use Black Matrix area within the OLED panel itself.

* Apple has long been looking to implement fullscreen smartphone design. “Our vision has always been to create a iPhone that has its front completely filled with a display,” the firm said at the iPhone X announcement last year.
* If Apple achieves a truly fullscreen iPhone design, Android OEMs will be pissed.
* According to the rumor-mill, Apple is planning to release three iPhone models this year: a second-generation iPhone X with a 5.8-inch OLED display, a new Plus-sized model with a 6.5-inch OLED panel and a third model with a 6.1-inch panel based on the ubiquitous LCD screen technology, serving as the most affordable option in the lineup.
* All three models are said to feature Face ID, smaller notches and even thinner bezels.
* Thoughts?
