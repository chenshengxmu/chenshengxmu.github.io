* In addition to the new iPad, Apple introduced a couple of new accessories on stage during today’s event. The two more notable mentions were from Logitech: a stylus, which they are calling the Crayon, and a rugged keyboard—both of which obviously work with the new iPad.

* Here’s a blurb from Logitech’s website:
* Logitech Crayon is a versatile, pixel-precise digital pencil that elevates the way teachers teach and students learn in K-12 classrooms. Designed specifically for iPad 6th-generation and its large Multi-Touch Retina display, Logitech Crayon brings another dimension to learning and opens up new avenues of creativity for any class or curriculum. With Logitech Crayon and iPad together, the only limit to what’s possible is a student’s imagination
* And here’s what you need to know about it:

* Again, we have a blurb from Logitech:
* iPad brings lessons to life with thousands of educational apps, books and courses. Designed in collaboration with educators, administrators and IT specialists, Rugged Combo 2 is the perfect partner for iPad in the classroom – a secure case that protects iPad against drops, spills and scratches combined with a durable kid-friendly keyboard. Rugged Combo 2 lets you easily bring iPad into any classroom to better support students’ learning no matter the grade level or assignment.
* And your highlighted points of interest:
* We couldn’t find details on pricing and availability (outside of Apple announcing the Crayon’s $49 price tag) and Logitech’s website says all sales and samples are handled through the Apple Education channel. We’ll update this post if we discover more information.
