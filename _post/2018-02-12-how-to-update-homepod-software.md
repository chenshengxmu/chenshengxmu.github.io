* Like other Apple devices, HomePod runs its own software that can be easily upgraded as soon as a new firmware becomes available to download over the air.
* Like with other Apple devices, future HomePod firmwares will bring new features and fixes.
* HomePod software updates are handled by Apple’s stock Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or newer. You cannot install new software on your HomePod unless your iOS device is signed in with the Apple ID that you used to set up the speaker.
* HomePod defaults to automatically installing new firmwares as they become available. However, you can turn automatic updates off and manually check for new HomePod firmwares.
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 2) Tap the arrow icon in the upper-left corner.
* 3) Choose the Software Update option.

* TIP: If you have multiple HomeKit-compliant homes set up in the Home app, choose the option Home Settings after tapping the arrow icon, then select a home to check for updates.
* 4) If there’s a new software update available for your HomePod, tap Install and follow onscreen instructions to apply the new firmware to your Siri-driven speaker.
* NOTE: Tapping the Install option will deploy the most recent software update across all of your HomePod speakers you have set up in your home.

* While the ability to install a software update on multiple HomePod devices in your home at once saves you from having to update each HomePod individually, it would be nice to have the option to install new software on one of your HomePods and not the others.
* If you’d like to turn off automatic updates for your HomePod, slide the toggle labeled Install Updates Automatically in the Home app to the OFF position.
* TUTORIAL: How to find your HomePod’s serial number and iOS software version
* The current version of your HomePod’s firmware is shown in iCloud settings on your iOS device (choose your speaker from the list of devices) or you can see it in the Home app: tap the Home tab, press your HomePod with 3D Touch (or tap and hold), then choose Details.
