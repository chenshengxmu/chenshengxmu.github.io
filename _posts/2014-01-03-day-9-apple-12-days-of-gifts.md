* We are now on day 9 of the big 12 Days of Gifts event, meaning Apple has removed the Diary of a Wimpy iBook and has posted a new free item for download. Today’s gift is an EP (or extended play) from the American rock band Kings of Leon.
* The band is widely popular in the UK, and more recently the US, taking home 3 Grammy Awards in 2010 thanks to hits like ‘Use Somebody.’ And today’s free EP includes some of those hits, which it played at Apple’s iTunes Festival this year…

* From the iTunes description:
* “Comprised of three Followill brothers — Caleb (guitar), Nathan (drums), and Jared (bass) — as well as first cousin Matthew Followill (guitar), Kings of Leon formed in 2000. The Followill siblings had spent their youth traveling across America’s heartland with their evangelist father, decamping at Pentecostal churches and tent revivals for several days at a time before moving onward. When their father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music (not to mention the accompanying lifestyle) they’d previously been denied. […]
* The audio tracks on this EP are Mastered for iTunes. This EP was recorded at the iTunes Festival—a month of exclusive live performances at the legendary Roundhouse in London. The first iTunes Festival launched in 2007, bringing out a wide array of amazing music every night for an entire month. Check out more EPs like this one and go to www.itunes.com/festival for more information.”
* The EP includes what appears to be 2 audio tracks: Black Thumbnail and Sex On Fire—both of which are live performances. And then there’s 2 music videos of the band’s performances from the 2013 iTunes Festival of songs Family Tree and Wait for Me.
* Again, the gift will only be available for 24 hours, and varies depending on your country or region. And we have just 3 days to go in Apple’s gift-giving event this year, so make sure you take advantage of it while you can. You can find the free app here.
