* Phew, today is an accessories day. Logitech owned the morning with its iPad mini Bluetooth keyboard, then Cody blogged about Mophie’s 1500mAh Juice Pack Helium for the iPhone 5.
* Shortly after came word of Griffin’s artsy Designer Series cases which add a little bit of flair and wit to your iPhone 5.
* Not to be outdone by its rivals, OtterBox has launched a case customization program for owners of the iPhone 4/4S/5 and Samsung’s Galaxy S III. What’s this for, you ask. How about 35 different combinations of polycarbonate and silicone cases for your iPhone 4 or 4S and a remarkable 72 combinations of different designs for the iPhone 5?
* All you’re required to do is choose from a bunch of color combinations at the OtterBox web site.
* The company wrote in a media release that each case has a built-in screen protector and a holster style-belt clip. The shell is a two-piece polycarbonate part while the outer slipcover is made from silicone.
* Three layers of defense include a plastic shell that cushions the iPhone 5 while a built-in screen protector prevents scratches and smudges.
* The rubber outer slipcover wraps around the inner shell, creating a practically indestructible iPhone 5 case. A holster is included and doubles as a viewing stand.
* Here’s an example case I customized.
* Yes, red is my favorite color.

* The OtterBox Defender Series Build Your Own program is available, for a limited time.
* Last but not the least: if you own a Samsung Galaxy S III, OtterBox will treat you to 42 different designs for your handset.
* And just like that, all of a sudden life gets a little more exciting.
