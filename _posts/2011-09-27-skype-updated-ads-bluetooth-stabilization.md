* Skype has updated its iPhone and iPad apps in the App Store with several new changes and features. Bluetooth headset support has finally been added to Skype for iOS. A “bugfix for security vulnerability” has also been added, making us think that the privacy vulnerability from earlier has been patched.
* Anti-shake technology has also been introduced to help stabilize users’ video streams during a call. Skype has also added in-app advertisements for those who haven’t purchased Skype credit…
* “Skype for iPhone/iPod touch version 3.5.84
* Skype for iPad version 3.5.84
* According to Skype, “advertising will be shown to users that do not have Skype Credit, a calling subscription or premium subscription.” Those that haven’t purchased credit will undoubtedly hate this change.
* Skype also noted that its iPhone app has been downloaded a staggering 60 million times. Bluetooth and image stabilization are welcomed additions to the app.
* Here’s a video demo of Skype’s anti-shake feature in action:
* You can download Skype for iPhone and Skype for iPad in the App Store.
* Are you upset that Skype is adding advertisements to its iOS app?
