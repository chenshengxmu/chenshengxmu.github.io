* Apple’s Calendar application for the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Mac and iCloud.com makes it simple to share events and to-dos with select people, or let anyone with a link subscribe to a read-only calendar.
* For example, you could share a “To Do” calendar with your significant other, create a calendar for your entire family so every member can put errands on it, invite your wife to a shared “Kids” calendar to keep parents in the loop about school activities and more.
* Not only do shared calendars increase your productivity in the workplace, they help those who use them become more organized in everyday life. You can assign edit privileges to invitees, adjust how participants access the calendar and more.
* Invitees have a myriad of options at their disposal to view shared calendars, including the iCloud Calendar web app, the stock Calendar app on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac or Microsoft Outlook on a Windows computer.
* In this tutorial, you will learn how to share a calendar privately or publicly on iPhone, iPad, Mac and iCloud.com. You will also learn how to manage calendar sharing by adding or removing participants, changing privileges, adjusting calendar notifications, and more.
* For the purposes of this tutorial, we’re going to assume that you want to share calendars with iCloud-enabled friends and family. To create an iCloud calendar that you’ll be sharing with other people, launch Apple’s Calendars app on your iOS device, tap Edit, then tap Add Calendar in the iCloud section.
* You can also share an Exchange or CalDAV calendar with co-workers, but this option is limited to people who use the same calendar service as you and isn’t covered here.
* You can share a calendar privately with other iCloud users, who must accept your invitation by clicking a link in an email taking them to the iCloud login page. They can accept your invitation in the Calendar app on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Mac, too.
* Either way, they need an iCloud account to accept.
* Participants can view privately shared iCloud calendars in the iCloud Calendar web app, the stock Calendar app on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac or in Microsoft Outlook on a Windows computer.
* A privately shared calendar can only be edited by its creator and people on your Share With list whom you have assigned edit privileges.
* 1) Launch Apple’s Calendar app on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Calendars.
* 3) Tap the “i” button next to the iCloud calendar you want to share.
* 4) On the next screen, scroll down to the bottom and make sure that the switch next to Public Calendar is set to the OFF position.

* Sharing a read-only calendar publicly allows anyone to see it, provided they have a link.
* Visitors can access your public calendar using the stock Calendar app on their iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac, in Microsoft Outlook on a Windows computer or via any other app that supports the iCalendar file format.
* An invitee doesn’t need to be an iCloud user to accept an invitation to view a shared public calendar. Invitees who subscribe to your public calendar can view it in read-only mode as only the calendar creator is permitted to make changes.
* 1) Launch Apple’s Calendar app on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Calendars.
* 3) Tap the “i” button next to the iCloud calendar you want to share.
* 4) On the next screen, scroll down to the bottom and make sure that the switch next to Public Calendar is set to the ON position.

* 6) Tap Done to save the changes and get back to the previous screen.
* Tip: You can invite specific people to a public calendar: tap Add Person and enter the name or email addresses of people you want to shared the calendar with. This lets everyone with a link see your calendar, but only specific people are allowed to make the changes.

* Here are a few things you should keep in mind that will help you increase your productivity and make the most from shared calendars.
* Email invitations to shared iCloud calendars are sent from your iCloud email address. If you disable your iCloud account, any calendars you have shared will become unavailable for everyone, with each participant receiving an automatically generated email notifying them that the calendar is no longer shared.
* You may be wondering if shared calendars and collaborative editing play nice. In a word, yes! Every change the calendar owner or a participant with edit privileges makes will be reflected on the devices of other participants.
* RELATED: How to access list view in Calendar on iPhone
* However, if multiple participants try to edit a shared calendar at the same time, the changes that are saved first are kept and reflected in the calendar and the guy whose changes arenʼt saved sees a message saying their updates had not been saved.
* There are many ways you can take advantage of shared calendars. My boss, for instance, has shared with me a calendar of upcoming tutorials. We both add articles to it and move things around, which helps us plan iDownloadBlog’s tutorial coverage.
* You might want to create a calendar for your junior’s sports team and share it privately with just the coaches so they can edit it, or share it publicly with all the parents to let them view it whenever they want.

* Or, you could create a shared “Kids” calendar to keep family members in the loop about school and weekend activities. Speaking of which, when you set up Family Sharing to start a new family group, the “Family” calendar will be automatically created and all family members will be added to it.
* Every family member can add, view or change events and reminders related to family matters such as camping trips and violin recitals. Family members cannot be removed from the “Family” calendar except by leaving or being removed from Family Sharing.
* Apple’s current restrictions limit the total number of calendars, events and reminders per iCloud account to 25,000 items. You can have no more than a hundred combined calendars and reminder lists and their combined size (excluding attachments) cannot exceed 24MB.
* You can invite up to 300 attendees to an event and share a private calendar with up to a hundred invitees.
