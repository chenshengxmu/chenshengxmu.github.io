* With iTunes 11, Apple’s music software received a complete, much-needed, makeover. Unfortunately, it also removed some much-loved features like Cover Flow and the ability to find your duplicate track listings.
* Well today, users can get at least one of those features back via a new update. Apple has just released iTunes 11.0.1 to the public, and as expected, it includes the duplicate item finding feature and other fixes…
* Here’s the iTunes 11.0.1 release notes from Apple’s support website:
* “This update to the new iTunes addresses an issue where new purchases in iCloud may not appear in your library if iTunes Match is turned on, makes iTunes more responsive when searching a large library, fixes a problem where the AirPlay button may not appear as expected, and adds the ability to display duplicate items within your library. This update also includes other important stability and performance improvements.”
* If you haven’t tried iTunes 11 yet, you should check it out. It features a redesigned UI, revamped iTunes Store, and some new features like UpNext. It also has a new MiniPlayer, and enhanced iCloud integration.
