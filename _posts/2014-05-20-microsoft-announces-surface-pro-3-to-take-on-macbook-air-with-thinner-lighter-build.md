* Microsoft has announced the Surface Pro 3 at a media event in New York City on Tuesday, setting its sights on not only Apple’s iPad, but the MacBook Air as well.
* The Surface Pro 3 busts past the 10.1-inch norm to a 12-inch display with a 2160 x 1440 resolution. It’s not a 16:9 aspect ratio, but rather a more comfortable 3:2 aspect ratio with a HD screen – a first for Microsoft’s Surface line. But the thinness and lightness is where Microsoft is hoping to sell you. 
* Microsoft is touting the Surface Pro 3 as being the thinnest-ever product to run a laptop-grade Intel Core processor. It weighs 800g (1.76 pounds) and is 9.1mm thick. Press at the event are claiming it’s a very light tablet, and of course, Microsoft’s Surface team thinks its your ideal laptop replacement, even going as far to pit it against the MacBook Air on stage.
* “This is the tablet than can replace your laptop,” Panos Panay, Surface boss at Microsoft, said at the event on Tuesday.
* Compared to the last two versions of the Surface Pro, you still get the same Surface feel. There’s a kickstand on the back for when you want to put it in laptop mode, and a Type Cover keyboard that will allow you to type like on a traditional laptop. Microsoft has upgraded the Type Cover with a better design and more accurate trackpad, as well.
* The Surface Pro 3 will start at $799 and $129 for the keyboard. There will be Intel i3, i5, and i7 processor options available when it starts selling on May 21.
