* Here’s more from the Hickory Daily Record:
* The City of Claremont approved Monday night a development agreement with Apple Inc. to annex land into the city for a new solar farm.
* Apple’s initial investment in the 100-acre, 17.5 megawatt solar farm is $55 million. And the tech giant’s project will create 75 indirect jobs during construction. City Manager Doug Barrick said Apple agreed to use source jobs locally, if possible.
* The outlet goes on to say that Apple plans to have a grading permit submitted for the property by the end of the year, pending the acquisition of the land and other factors. The company hopes to complete the project within 5 years.
* The North Carolina campus is just one of Apple’s many ongoing data center projects. It is also working on centers in Prineville, Oregon and Reno, Nevada, and it likes to tout that all of its data centers run on 100% renewable energy.
