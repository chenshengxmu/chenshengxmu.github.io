* Following a report that T-Mobile is canceling vacations for store employees between September 20 and September 22, another story has affirmed that rival AT&T is now following suit. Specifically, the carrier is said to be blacking out vacation days for the second half of September, seemingly in preparation for the iPhone 5S/5C launch date.
* That’s a tell-tale sign of an impending iPhone launch: carriers want to ensure enough staff is on hand to handle an influx of customers at launch. Notably, AT&T did the same last year ahead of the iPhone 5 launch, as well as every single year starting with the original iPhone launch back in 2007.
* Putting these pieces together, new iPhones are very likely going on sale in the United States and a few major international markets on Friday, September 20, which would be ten days after the official unveiling…
* This one comes from Jonathan Geller, who runs BGR.
* We were also told that AT&T will not be launching any other high-profile devices during the second half of September, again confirming that this time period is for the upcoming iPhones. 
* Though Geller’s track record has been on a somewhat of a downward spiral, he does have solid carrier sources and has usually been right with these things most of the time.
* Note that the September 20 launch has previously been reported for Japan by the prominent Japanese business newspaper Nikkei and for Greece by Techmaniacs.
