* Every week iDownloadblog brings a roundup of awesome apps for you to check out and enjoy. We try to vary our picks, but a lot of these apps usually come from the App Store. If an interesting web or jailbreak app catches our eye, we’ll include that in our picks as well.
* This week, we’ve got three new apps from the App Store for music lovers, Google+ users, and trekkies. Make it so!
* Spotify

* Spotify is a music streaming service that’s already seen massive success in Europe for quite some time. Only until this past week did Spotify finally make its way to the US, and it’s been met with a range of criticism and praise.
* The power of Spotify is that it’s all of your music with you wherever you go. The iPhone app launched in the US App Store a few days ago, and the app itself is an essential part of a paid Spotify customer’s music arsenal.

* If you’ve subscribed to the Premium Spotify plan for $9.99/month (or are interested in doing so), make sure to check out the free iPhone app. The Spotify app’s design and interface looks really great, and it’s got all of the features you’d ever need from a cloud-based media player. Hopefully Apple will be able to compete with iCloud this Fall.
* Piconhand

* If you’re one of the lucky ones to get into the new Google+ social network, then you may be scratching your head as to why Apple hasn’t approved an app for it yet. While we don’t have an ETA on the Google+ app, we do have Piconhand.

* Piconhand allows you to easily upload photos from your iPhone to Google+ through Google’s photo service, Picasa. Once you’ve installed Piconhand for free from the App Store, head over to your iPhone’s Location Services panel in the Settings app. Make sure Location Services for Piconhand is turned on, and you should be good to go.
* We assume that the official Google+ app will have photo sharing capabilities, but Piconhand will have to hold you off for now.
* Star Trek PADD

* Make it so Number One! Star Trek now has its own official iPad app. Star Trek PADD brings the entire Star Trek universe straight to your iPad’s screen with everything you could ever care to know about your favorite characters, places, etc. If you’re a Star Trek fan and you own an iPad, you need to download this app. Simple as that.

* Star Trek PADD’s design mimics the look and feel of Star Trek, and there’s all kinds of interactive elements to gawk at and mess around with. Pick up the app for $4.99 in the App Store, and prepare to spend the next hour or so immersed in the Star Trek universe.
* That’s it for this week’s picks! We’ll be back next week for more awesome apps to share with you guys.
* Developers: Get in touch with us! We want to see what app creations you’ve been working on, and we love sharing useful and fun apps with our readers. Drop us a line to get in touch.
