* Apple has launched a new spot on its homepage to show images shot on the iPhone 6, interestingly following the announcement of the Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9 on Sunday.
* The “shot on iPhone 6” section shows images taken by iPhone users, with a description and the apps used to make the photo happen shown, including the default camera app, Instagram, and VSCO Cam.
* “People take incredible photos and videos on iPhone 6 every day,” Apple wrote on its website. “And here are some of our favorites. Explore the gallery, learn a few tips, and see what’s possible with the world’s most popular camera.”
* The iPhone camera has often become a substitute for many people’s DSLRs. Apple overtook Nikon for the second place spot in 2014 on Flickr, a photo enthusiast site. The iPhone 5, 4S and 4 were the top three for both 2013 and 2014.
* You can visit Apple’s website to see the collection of images. They’re pretty good.
