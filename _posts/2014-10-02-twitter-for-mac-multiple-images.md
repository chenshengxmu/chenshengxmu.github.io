* After refreshing its iPhone and iPad app with support for Interactive Notifications on iOS 8 and revamped profile pages, the micro-blogging platform Twitter on Thursday issued an update to its Mac client implementing a pair of new photo features.
* The first allows you to add an image to your direct messages and the other introduces support for attaching up to four images to a single tweet.
* Twitter for Mac 3.1 is available free in the Mac App Store.
* The new version at last makes it possible to enjoy tweets with multiple photos on your Mac. As indicated by the screenshot below, the Mac client previously showed only the first image in your timeline and wouldn’t let you browse the other images.

* With Twitter for Mac 3.1 installed, that tweet at the top of my timeline which promotes my article about Samsung’s bend-stress Galaxy Note 4 video is now showing the four attached images correctly. Tapping on any thumbnail brings up the full size photo.

* Twitterrific, the popular alternative to Twitter’s own mobile app, received an update earlier this week enabling 1Password integration and other enhancements.
* And just yesterday, Tweetbot by Tapbots got refreshed with native display support on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, in addition to support for iOS 8 Extensions, Interactive Notifications and other perks.
* Twitter for Mac 3.1 changelog:
* The 4.1-megabyte application supports any Mac with OS X 10.7 or later.
* [Mac App Store]
