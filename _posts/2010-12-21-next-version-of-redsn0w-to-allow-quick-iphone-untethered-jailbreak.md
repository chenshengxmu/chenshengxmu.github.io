* If you decided to update to iOS 4.2.1 and jailbreak using RedSn0w, you most likely have a tethered jailbreak, which requires you to plug your iPhone in and kickstart it with RedSn0w every time you reboot. Very inconvenient.
* We’ve had words for a while that the Dev Team was working on an untethered jailbreak, which MuscleNerd confirmed would be available before Christmas.
* Today, the Dev Team’s frontman gave us more information about this untethered jailbreak via a tweet in reply to someone asking if we’ll have to fully restore the iPhone and run RedSn0w again in order to benefit from all the untethered goodness…
* According to MuscleNerd, the process shouldn’t require a restore. You’ll most likely have to run RedSn0w on top of your current install and it should take care of it for you. That’s pretty good news. A restore can be a painful process, especially if you have lots of jailbreak apps and themes to reinstall.
* We’re now days away from Christmas and it hasn’t been confirmed again whether we’ll get this untethered jailbreak before the 25th. iPhone hackers do celebrate Christmas too, so a delay in the release of the RedSnow untethered jailbreak wouldn’t be surprising.
* I bet many of you are waiting for this untethered jailbreak, am I wrong?
