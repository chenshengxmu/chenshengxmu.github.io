* TetherMe is a new jailbreak application that brings native tethering to the iPhone. According to the app description, it should work for any carrier without the need for customized bundles or preferences.
* TetherMe has been tested to work on all iOS versions from 3.0 to 4.0.1 and works by telling the iPhone to allow tethering on any APN that is used for iPhone data. As a result, you should not be charged extra from your phone company as all tethering data appears to come from the phone itself.
* TetherMe also bypasses signature checking and allows you to edit your carrier bundle manually if you so desire. This is required to enable MMS functionality on T-Mobile. TetherMe does NOT enable the loading of APN configurations from .mobileconfig profiles at this time.
* This app is different from my favorite jailbreak app MyWi, which allows to turn your iPhone into a wifi hotspot. Instead, TetherMe allows for native tethering as Apple intended it to be, using Bluetooth or USB.
* There is no icon for this item. After installation and reboot, you’ll be able to turn tethering ON in Settings > General > Network, or install the Tethering Toggle for SBSettings.
* Available for $1.99 in Cydia, this might be a good alternative to the more expensive MyWi if you don’t want to share your Internet connection with other devices. If however you want to use your iPhone as a hotspot, then MyWy will still be your best bet.
* Please let us know what you think of this application by leaving a comment below.
