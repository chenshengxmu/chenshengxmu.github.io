* Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far the easiest way to get Siri running on your older devices like the iPhone 4, or iPod touch G4, and it requires no proxy server or meticulous setup.
* As long as you have a generous friend that’s willing to send you a file from their jailbroken iPhone 4S, you can have Siri running on an older device in just a few minutes.
* Inside, we’ll walk you through how to use AssistantConnect and AssistantConnect4S on video. It’s extremely simple, just follow this brief tutorial…
* Step 1: Install Spire on your iPhone 4, or other older device. Once installed go to Settings > General > and enable Siri.
* Step 2: Install AssistantConnect4S on an iPhone 4S device, open the AssistantConnect4S app, and reboot your iPhone 4S.
* Step 3: Install AssistantConnect on the iPhone 4, or other older device.
* Step 4: After your iPhone 4S reboots open AssistantConnect4S, and then invoke Siri, and ask it anything. Once Siri responds, tap the “Email Siri Data” button, and email the data to the iPhone 4, or other non 4S device. Make sure the attachment has a file size (mine reports 0.9kb) to ensure that it’s not empty.
* Step 5: On your iPhone 4 or older device, open the email sent from the iPhone 4S with the attachment, and open the attachment. Tap the button that says Open in “AssistantConnect”. AssistantConnect will open to a dialogue that says “File Copied” and “AssistantConnect File Loaded Successfully”. Tap Dismiss, go to your Home screen, and respring or reboot your device.
* Step 6: Once your iPhone 4 or older device is back up, hold your Home button to invoke Siri and ask her a question. It should work just like on an iPhone 4S!
* And that’s it. This is by far without a doubt the easiest way to get Siri outside of buying your very own iPhone 4S.
