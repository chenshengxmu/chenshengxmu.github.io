* The popular open-source, cross-platform BitTorrent client, Transmission, today received its first major update in more than a year and a half. As first noted by Softpedia, the surprise update makes the free of charge app fully compatible with the user interface on Macs running OS X 10.9 Mavericks and later.
* Transmission can now trim potential URIs from clipboard and supports downloading from HTTP servers on OS X El Capitan. Transmission’s daemon, web client, Qt client and GTK+ client have also received various fixes. All told, there are over 50 changes in this release of Transmission.
* Across platforms, Transmission now does a better job at torrent renaming with a common prefix. Additionally, the refreshed application now supports a bunch of cryptographic backends such as PolarSSL, CyaSSL and WolfSSL.
* Transmission’s Qt client has gained improvements, too, among them better handling of magnet links and a new contextual menu on the Files tab of the Torrent Properties dialog.
* As of this version, Macs with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or earlier are no longer supported. Be that as it may, I am particularly glad that Transmission to this date continues to be free of in-app advertising, unlike its rival uTorrent which is full of adware.
* Here’s everything that has been improved and fixed in Transmission 2.9.
* All platforms:
* Mac client:
* GTK+ client
* Qt client
* Daemon
* Web client
* Again, this is the first major update to this free of charge, cross-platform BitTorrent client in nearly two years (the previous update is dated May 18, 2014).
* I’m glad they’re keeping this awesome app alive. It’s very fast, reliable, feature-packed and better than BitTorrent’s official client or the ad-infested uTorrent, if you ask me.
* You can download Transmission at the official website.
* What’s your favorite BiTorrent client for the Mac?
