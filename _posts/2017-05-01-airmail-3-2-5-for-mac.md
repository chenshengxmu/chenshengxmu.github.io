* Italian developer Bloop today updated its excellent Mac email client Airmail with a bunch of new features, third-party integrations and other enhancements. Airmail 3.2.5 for macOS, a free update for existing users, introduces new integrations with the information management app DEVONThink and Bear, a beautiful writing app for notes and prose. Other new features include HTML user templates, out-of-office auto responders, enhanced privacy and more.
* The app now supports Gmail legacy authentication.
* In Airmail 3.2.5, it’s now possible to set your out-of-office auto responders. Setting out of office replies for Gmail accounts will result in the app refreshing your Gmail access token.
* Privacy-minded users can protect their privacy better with the newly added ability to prevent Airmail from loading external resources. Other minor fixes in this release of Airmail include the Send Later option for plain text messages, custom folders and other under-the-hood tweaks listed on the official website.
