* Software maker Microsoft has announced that Sway for iPhone and iPad will be removed from App Store on October 19 and discontinued fully on December 17, 2018.
* A Microsoft employee shared the news on the company’s forums yesterday.
* Microsoft is retiring the Sway for iOS app on December 17, 2018.
* With this change, we’re consolidating our Sway experience. Sway online provides the same, most up-to-date feature set across platforms and devices.
* All Sways that you have created or edited on Sway for iOS will continue to exist, and you access them on Sway online.
* You can use the iOS app until December 17, 2018. After that date, when you open the app you will be greeted with a message directing you to Sway online.
* We want to extend the biggest thank you to our iOS users. We appreciate your support of Sway for iOS and look forward to seeing your Sways online.
* The Windows giant is advising customers use Sway online at sway.office.com.
* Microsoft has added that, in addition to sway.office.com, your Sway projects will continue to be accessible through the Windows 10 app, which is available free in Microsoft Store.
* The timeline for retirement for the Sway iOS app is as follows:
* Sway for Windows 10 will continue to exist because it’s a web-hosted app.
* Sway was quite an interesting piece of software.
* Launched on App Store in January 2015, the business-focused app permitted users to create visually striking newsletters, documents and interactive presentation complete with images, captions, headers and styled text in minutes.
* I’ve played with Sway a number of times and was pleased with its features that let you do things like share interactive reports, stories, presentations and more. It’s a good thing that Sway lives on as a web app, but I would much rather prefer a native experience.
* Have you used Sway and if so, how did you like it?
* Let us know in the comments!
