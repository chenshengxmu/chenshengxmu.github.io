* Chances are you probably heard about Siri coming with the iPhone 4S. Many current iPhone 4 users were bummed when Apple announced that it would be a iPhone 4S-only feature.
* The jailbreak community is already working on porting Apple’s revolutionary Siri technology to the 4G iPod touch. Thanks to iH8sn0w and Gojohnnyboi, hackers have somewhat ported Siri to the previous generation iPod touch already…

* As seen in the picture above, it is not fully functioning. According to iH8sn0w, it is a “work in progress.” This still has a long way to go, but it may be successfully ported once iOS 5 is officially released. According to iH8sn0w’s twitter, Apple might have left out crucial files for Siri in the iOS 5 GM.

* It’s nowhere near perfect. But it’s getting there.
* What do you think? Are you excited to potentially have Siri on your jailbroken 4G iPod touch? Here’s hoping that will see it on the iPhone 4, too!
* Here’s a statement from iH8sn0w about the process, courtesy of Josh Tucker:
* “It’s definitely not just a plist value that you have to change in order to get Siri. Thus far, it has required a lot of searching and digging. After sending all the known information to John, I’m beginning to find that it is much harder than expected. We’re using an iPod touch 4G now but our aim is to port it to all devices that Apple won’t support. At this point, we’re unsure of whether Siri requires certain hardware components or not. At this point, we can’t say but are still trying. After buying the iPhone 4S myself, I will be looking to see if there are any new files that are not available on the current iOS 5 version. This might be our stopping point.”
* UPDATE: We were originally under the impression that iH8sn0w was working on the iPhone 4, but he reached out to us and said that he was testing the 4G iPod touch instead. We have removed all references to the iPhone 4 in the article. Sorry for the misleading information.
