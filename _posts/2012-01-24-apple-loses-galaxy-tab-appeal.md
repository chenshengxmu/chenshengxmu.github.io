* Apple today lost the latest round of its legal battle with Samsung, with a Dutch appeal court siding with the Korean tablet and smartphone maker.
* Apple had claimed that Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet had infringed upon some of company’s iPad patents, and sought a ban of the infringing hardware. At an appeal hearing today however, a Dutch judge at The Hague deemed the Galaxy Tab 10.1 to be a legal device, saying that it does not infringe on Apple’s patents…
* This decision now clears the way for Samsung’s tablet in the country, with Apple having previously requested an outright ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 due to the claimed patent infringement.
* People who can read Dutch can check out the whole decision online here, should that kind of thing get the juices flowing. If you don’t read Dutch then FOSS Patents, as always, has an extremely detailed look at the ruling here, too.
* This is just the latest in a long line of legal battles between the two giants, and we’re sure we haven’t heard the last of it either.
