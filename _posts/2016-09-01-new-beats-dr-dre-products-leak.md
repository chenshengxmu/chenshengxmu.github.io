* Beats emailed French media earlier this morning to inform them that “a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled” at the iPhone 7 event on September 7. However, it would seem that Beats’ public relations department sent the email prematurely as at least one French outlet, iGen.fr, was contacted by Beats PR and asked to take down the screenshot from the email, which they did.
* Now we at least know that other hardware will be announced at the iPhone 7 event.
* At any rate, it would seem that new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled at the iPhone 7 event. And if that’s the case, I would go as far as to speculate that one of those products is a Bluetooth-enabled version of the EarPods, that will probably be marketed as ‘AirPods’, which “confirms” once again the headphone jack is gone.
* For what it’s worth, Russian website Mobiltelefon.ru (Google Translate) recently discovered a series of regulatory filings published by the Eurasian Economic Commission, suggesting Apple is readying a pair of wireless headphones dubbed ‘AirPods’ alongside three other models to be marketed under the Beats brand, as well as two new iPhone models and a total of ten Apple Watch models.
* Back in November 2015, multiple international trademark applications for an “AIRPODS” audio accessory were filed by a shell company the Cupertino firm had likely set up.
* Thoughts?
