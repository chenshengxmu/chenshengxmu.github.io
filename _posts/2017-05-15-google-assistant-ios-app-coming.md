* After unveiling Assistant at Google I/O a year ago, the search giant is now expected to bring its AI conversational helper to iPhone and iPad in the form of a standalone app, AndroidPolice reported Monday. The app should be announced at Google’s annual developers conference, which kicks off on Wednesday, May 17, at Shoreline Amphitheatre Mountain View in California.
* Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, said a trusted source cited in the report. Assistant’s SDK  was just made available to developers so bringing the app to Apple’s mobile platform could encourage more developers to integrate with its functionality.
* Here’s an excerpt from the article:
* The app would likely feature a blend of the “chat” style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant.
* Rather than roll out Assistant as a standalone app, Google could fold its functionality into the existing search app for iOS, which supports Google Now cards but not Assistant.
* A company executive hinted two months ago that Google’s general philosophy is that “we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible.”
* After debuting exclusively on Google’s Pixel line of smartphones in October of last year, Google Assistant soon after made its way into into Google’s voice-activated speaker, called Home, the latest version of Android Wear and a few devices from third-party vendors.
* It powers AI features in Google’s messaging app Allo and will be at the heart of the new Android operating system for touchscreen car consoles and in-car infotainment systems.
* You can expect the feature to become integrated over time into virtually every major device Google makes, as well as into its most important consumer-facing services and mobile apps.
