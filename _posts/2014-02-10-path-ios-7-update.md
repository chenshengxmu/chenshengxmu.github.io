* The once popular private social network, Path, has finally received today its way, way overdue iOS 7 refresh. I mean, the 2014 Valentine’s Day is looming and Apple released iOS 7 back on September 18, 2013.
* If you’re still using Path – I don’t as I’m pressed for time – you’ll immediately notice a revamped appearance making the software adhere to the overall iOS 7 aesthetics.
* Controls in Settings have been simplified, you can now use the iOS 7 swipe gesture to navigate the menus and browsing the Shop is now cleaner and more streamlined than it used to be.
* The team says they’ve made the new version (3.4) simpler and easier to “do the things you do every day with Path”. Jump past the fold to see some nice screenies and learn more about the app. Or, if you’re impatient you can just go ahead and immediately grab Path 3.4 free in the App Store…
* Here’s the old (left) vs. new (right) Home screen icon.

* Yes, you can now finally use the system-wide iOS 7 swipe gesture to quickly get from any messaging thread back home. In addition to a fresh coat of paint, the new Path has reorganised the Settings interface with the more detailed controls being grouped under the Account, Notifications and Sharing sections.
* Account lets you update your profile photo, cover photo, email and other personal information. Notifications is where you can manage notifications for your Inner Circle and your Friends. Finally, Sharing allows you to manage and control all of the networks used for posting to from Path.

* The team says they revamped the in-app Shop “to showcase our premium stickers and filters in a more simplified way.
* What does that mean?
* In a nutshell, the four buttons on the bottom navigation bar act as your shortcuts to browse premium stickers and filters, upgrade to Path Premium, browse or restore your purchased packs and shop items.
* On top of the new look and UI changes, you’ll hopefully notice some performance improvements in Path 3.4.
* Path 3.4 is available free of charge in the App Store.
* Surprisingly enough, the universal binary continues to support any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.0 or later.
* Do you at this point care about Path at all?
