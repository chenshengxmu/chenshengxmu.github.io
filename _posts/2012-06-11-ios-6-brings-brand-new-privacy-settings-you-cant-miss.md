* You might remember the privacy fiasco that started earlier this year when it was discovered that Path was uploading your whole address book to its servers. Of course, Path wasn’t the only app to do that, but it was the first to get the backlash that followed, forcing Apple to slightly change what the company requires app developer to do with your data and how they notify you.
* Because privacy is such a hot topic these days, Apple has gone the extra mile in the beta release of iOS 6, giving “privacy” its very own tab inside the Settings app…

* As you can see, Privacy settings are broken down into 4 sections: Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Photos.
* Every application that have requested access to any of those 4 sections will now be clearly listed in here.
