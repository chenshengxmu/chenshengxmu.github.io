title: Untethered iOS 5.0.1 Jailbreak Confirmed as Working, Safe to Update
---
* Got an untethered iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1. Feel free to update.

* We’ve received more information regarding the current status of the iOS 5 jailbreak. Famous hacker pod2g has just announced that he has successfully jailbroken his iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1.
* More importantly, the jailbreak is untethered — something we were previously concerned about regarding 5.0.1. We found out that an untethered jailbreak was possible a few days ago, and now it’s been confirmed as working on the iPhone 4.
* You may recall that, when Apple first seeded the latest iOS update, we warned jailbreakers to stay away. The new software was pushed out to patch a major exploit in iOS that we thought would be crucial to an untethered jailbreak.
* But it turns out that jailbreakers need not worry. Pod2g gave us video proof of an iOS 5 untethered jailbreak last week and has just confirmed that it works on the iPhone 4. Pod2g told his Twitter followers that folks with an iPhone 4 are now ok to update. Keep in mind that this does not apply to users looking for a SIM unlock.
* If nothing else, this is a good sign that an official iOS 5 jailbreak is nearing completion. Unfortunately, there still is no word on iPhone 4S-compatibility. Stay tuned to iDB for the latest jailbreak news.
