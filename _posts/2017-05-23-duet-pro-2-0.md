* Duet Display, an app billed as the first solution to turn your Apple tablet into a second display and a high-performance drawing tablet for your Mac or Windows PC, was updated on App Store today with some new features.
* The new Duet Display now lets you have the drawing experience on your iPad with the speedy rendering and sheer hardware power of a desktop.
* The update brings out a number of enhancements and new customizations, including a customized pressure curve, advanced gesture support, a more fluid drawing experience, improved color quality and more.
* Here are the key highlights in this release of Duet Display:
* Duet Display works over a USB connection as wired connections are significantly faster and far more responsive than wireless solutions. The app’s speedy rendering engine has a much lower latency than Apple’s AirPlay technology.
* Duet Display has proven to be very valuable to artists, designers and video editors as it essentially replaces a Wacom drawing tablet with your iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.
* The app supports finger drawing, too.

* Aside from drawing support, Duet Display can be used to turn your iPad into a second screen for your Mac or Windows PC. For instance, you could use your iPad Pro to keep tabs on your social media feeds while editing a document on your Mac’s primary display.
* The ability to turn a supported iOS device an external monitor for a Mac should be especially handy while you’re traveling or if you cannot afford an eternal display for your computer.
* Duet Display for iOS is a $19.99 value on App Store.
* To celebrate today’s update, the app is on sale today for $9.99.
* A pro-level upgrade which unlocks the ability to use your Apple tablet as a drawing tablet for your computer costs an additional $19.99 per year as an in-app subscription.
* Duet Display 2.0 for Mac or Windows is available directly from the official website.
