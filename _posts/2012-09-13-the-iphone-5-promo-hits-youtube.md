title: The iPhone 5 promo hits YouTube
---

* Apple’s promotional video detailing the biggest iPhone 5 features went live shortly following yesterday’s series of announcements, but you need QuickTime, Apple’s media software, to watch it in your browser.
* Many hate QuickTime, especially Windows PC users. The QuickTime for Windows installer is nearly a hundred megabyte download and the software has become infamous for its resource hoginess (is that even a word?).
* Luckily, two hours ago the company uploaded the clip to its YouTube channel and we’ve embedded it here for your viewing pleasure…
* Don’t forget that you can also stream the iPhone 5 keynote video directly from Apple.com (yes, QuickTime is required) or download the entire presentation in high-definition as an iTunes video podcast.
* Apple released another video on YouTube which details its in-ear headphones called EarPods. The clip explains some of the new solutions Apple’s acousticians came up with to achieve the richer bass and crisper highs.
* Surprisingly enough, the awesome ad for the colorful new iPods is nowhere to be found on Apple’s YouTube channel (but don’t worry, we have you covered!).
* What do you think of the iPhone 5 promo clip?
* Are you sold yet?
* By the way, don’t you love Jony Ive’s British pronunciation of the word ‘aluminum’ (in his version: ‘aluminium’)?
