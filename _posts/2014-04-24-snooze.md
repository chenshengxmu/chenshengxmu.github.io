* Snooze is a new jailbreak tweak by prolific jailbreak developer Julian Weiss. It’s a tweak that allows you to change snooze times for each alarm that you have set in the stock Clock app.
* Snooze was the subject of Weiss’ talk at JailbreakCon 2014, and it’s a tweak that’s been highly anticipated by users in the jailbreak community. We’ve taken the $0.99 jailbreak tweak for a spin on video. Does it live up to its billing? Have a look inside for all of the details.
* After installing Snooze, venture into the stock Clock app, and tap the Alarm tab. Create a new alarm, or edit an existing alarm, and you should see the new Snooze Time panel at the bottom of the page. Tapping this panel invokes a pop-up box, which allows you to type in a desired snooze time for the alarm.

* Snooze times can be broken down into fractions of a second for smaller times, and can go up to over three hours in length. The snooze time will be reflected on the Lock screen snooze countdown when you snooze your alarm.

* Although you won’t find tons of settings or custom options, Snooze is a fine tweak that does its job exceptionally well. If you’ve ever wanted to change the stock 9-minute snooze time established by Apple, then this is the tweak for you.
