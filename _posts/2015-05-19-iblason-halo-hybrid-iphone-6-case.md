* Nothing says “minimalist” more than nothing at all. However, most people don’t want to risk scratching up their beautiful iPhone 6 by leaving it completely unprotected.
* iBlason’s Halo Hybrid case is a mix between a cover and a bumper for the iPhone 6. It is thin, simple, and comes in clear, making it hard to tell that you have a case on your iPhone 6 at all.
* The case is a hard plastic, but flexible 3H rated scratch-resistant shell that snaps onto your iPhone 6. All ports are exposed including the back microphone and bottom speaker. Volume and power controls are covered with specially designed buttons that are slightly raised for easy access.
* The edges are surrounded by a soft, rubberized bumper for added drop protection. The material is anti-slip for better grip in your hand and on smooth surfaces. The front edges of the bumper are just slightly raised so your screen will not touch the surface when laying flat.
* The case comes in clear, which is minimalism at its best, and is available on Amazon for $9.99. However, if you want to add a splash of color, you can also get it in blue, yellow, black, green, and pink for $12.99. It is also available for the iPhone 6 Plus for $13.99 and up.
