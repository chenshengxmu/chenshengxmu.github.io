* Thursday, Apple seeded a sixth beta of the upcoming tvOS 9.2 software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV to the members of the Apple Developer Program.
* The new tvOS 9.2 beta 6 has a build number of “13Y5232a” and is available as an over-the-air update on new Apple TVs with a configuration profile installed.
* The restore image to side-load tvOS betas on Apple TVs via iTunes or Apple Configurator using a USB-C to USB-A cable is on Apple’s portal for developers.
* tvOS 9.2 will address some of pain points customers have had with the original software that shipped on fourth-generation boxes. The upcoming update, for instance, will let you organize Home screen apps into folders, like on iOS.
* Siri can now directly search the App Store and users can take advantage of the Dictation feature in text fields and for spelling out passwords in password fields. Siri has also gained support for US Spanish and French Canadian.
* tvOS 9.2 supports Bluetooth keyboards, has a redesigned app switcher that resembles that in iOS 9.0 or later and brings support for iCloud Photo Library and Live Photos.

* Apple TV apps using the new APIs can render maps on the big screen. Last but not least, tvOS 9.2 packs in a new firmware for the Siri Remote which improves sensor accuracy and brings support for additional sound bar and receiver hardware.
* We’ll update this post with any changes in tvOS 9.2 beta 6 as we encounter them.
