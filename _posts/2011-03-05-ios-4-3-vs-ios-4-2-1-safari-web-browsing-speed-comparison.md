* At Apple’s iPad 2 Event earlier this week, one of the major improvements in iOS 4.3 was Mobile Safari performance.
* Steve Jobs claimed that Apple has included the new Nitro JavaScript engine in iOS 4.3 which now powers Safari. According to Apple, the new Nitro JavaScript engine, not only improves web browsing responsiveness, but also runs JavaScript up to twice as fast as iOS 4.2.1, resulting in web pages and interactive features loading faster than ever before.
* Well, the folks over at iSpazio decided to test it out and see exactly how much faster Safari is on iOS 4.3 GM compared to iOS 4.2.1. The results yielded iOS 4.3 to be a a few seconds faster. Although it isn’t a huge difference, faster is always good, right? Check it out for yourself in the video below!
* Update: We’ve added benchmarks of Google’s V8 Benchmark Suite below. The benchmark results indicate that the iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3 GM is 3x and 2.4x faster the an iPhone 4 on iOS 4.2.1. The tests were done running iOS 4.3 on two different benchmark tests, in which each benchmark test was ran three times and the results were averaged.
