* I’ve only had the iPhone X for about a week, but I began a full-blown accessory scavenger hunt long before I had the new handset in my grasp.
* In this piece, I’ll outline some of what I think are the best accessories to use with the iPhone X.

* A strikingly-obvious choice for this list is Apple’s AirPods, which are some of the best wireless Bluetooth earbuds that I’ve ever used.
* I’ve been rocking the AirPods since they launched, and even though I used them previously with my iPhone 7 Plus, they’re still a match made in Heaven for the new iPhone X.
* Seamless integration with iOS, incredible sound quality, and convenient portability are just some of the highlights you can expect with AirPods.

* Apple only endorsed a select few Qi-enabled wireless chargers for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X at the most recent keynote, but the one that stood out to me the most was the sleek new offering from Mophie.
* Not only does it come with support for 7.5W wireless charging out of the box, which Apple says they will enable on all compatible iPhones in a future iOS 11 software update, but it keeps a small footprint on any tabletop you set it on.
* A subtle LED charging indicator, battery over-charge protection, and an included AC adapter encompass some of this wireless charger’s high points.
* You can pick this nifty thing up on Amazon for $59.99.

* With wireless charging becoming one of the most notable features in all of Apple’s latest handsets, Qi-enabled accessories are a big deal. The wireless charging base above is useful at home, but you still need something for your travels, and the Fonesalesman QiStone+ is an excellent choice for that.
* The QiStone+ is one of the few Qi-enabled wireless charging battery packs on the market today. It can both charge your iPhone with Qi and be charged with a Qi-enabled charging base. Even if you prefer to use a cable, it includes USB in/out ports for your convenience.
* The accessory’s stone-like aesthetic, 4,000 mAh power capacity, and convenient travel size are just some of the primary reasons to consider the QiStone+.

* I’m picky when it comes to cases, especially when handling a handset as stunning as the iPhone X. Mujjo’s Full-Leather case, on the other hand, stuck out to me like no other; not just because it’s sleek, but because it speaks volumes about my personality.
* Mujjo’s Full-Leather case for the iPhone X fits like a glove and the leather has a ‘harder’ feel to it, so it doesn’t feel as sticky in the palm of your hand as competing leather cases do. Most importantly, it keeps the minimalist look and feel that an iPhone user wants, and it does so in a classy way.
* Between the vast assortment of color choices, an optional back pocket for credit cards, and the apparent attention to detail, it’s hard to go wrong with Mujjo’s Full-Leather case for the iPhone X (unless you’re clumsy and need more protection).

* You can purchase a Mujjo Full-Leather case from Amazon for $44.95.

* The iPhone X takes away the bezels, offering a beautiful edge-to-edge OLED display. With so much screen in the palm of your hand, there’s a lot to go wrong during a drop, so the InvisibleShield Glass+ screen protector from ZAGG was an obvious choice for me.
* Glass+ retains the clarity of your iPhone’s naked display, and its tempered glass construction is scratch, shatter, and smudge-resistant. More importantly, if an InvisibleShield Glass+ screen protector ever cracks, ZAGG will replace it for free (just pay the shipping).
* The ultra-thin profile, the precision around the iPhone X’s notch and rounded corners, and the lifetime replacement guarantee are just some of the reasons to consider an InvisibleShield Glass+ screen protector over the plethora of others.
* You can pick one up on Amazon for $38.89.

* Whenever I listen to music around my house or watch a movie with the family, I turn to the battery-powered Marshall Stockwell Bluetooth speaker to fill my home with rich acoustic sound. Inspired by the design of traditional guitar amplifiers, the Marshall Stockwell looks stunning, and it sounds even better than it looks.
* When listening through the Marshall Stockwell, the audio is so crisp that you forget you’re using a Bluetooth speaker. I’m also a fan of the knurled metal knobs at the top, which offer a full range of bass, treble, and volume adjustability.
* With incredible 24-hour battery life, sound quality you wouldn’t believe, and a built-in USB port to charge your iPhone on the go, the Marshall Stockwell is a speaker you won’t want to pass up.

* With Star Wars: The Last Jedi on the brink of release, it only seems customary to include Sphero’s exclusive BB-8 remote controlled droid on this list.
* You can control BB-8 with the free companion app from the App Store. There are multiple ways to direct BB-8, whether you prefer an old-fashioned joystick or drawing a line for BB-8 to follow. BB-8 can also interact with voice commands or explore his environment autonomously.
* With its excellent aesthetics, handy wireless charging base, and interactive companion app, I couldn’t recommend this product more – especially if you’re a Star Wars fan.

* The Apple Watch Series 3 seems like a prominent staple in this list because I use it almost every day to perform tasks on my wrist without having to yank my iPhone out of my pocket every five minutes.
* I use the Apple Watch to respond to text messages, take phone calls, and check odds and ends from various other apps. I’ll even use it occasionally to get an answer from Siri or check the time during my busy day, all while reducing the battery strain on my iPhone X in the process.
* With its much faster processor, help from Siri Voice, and optional LTE capability, I think the Apple Watch Series 3 is a must-have companion for any iPhone X owner.
* You can get an Apple Watch Series 3 from Apple’s website for $329+.
* There are many more accessories I’d like to include in this list, but to keep things short and sweet, I limited the list to what I believe are the absolute essentials. I’ll be sure to update it if I come across any other goodies that are worth mentioning.
* Because everyone shares a different opinion about the best accessories for their unique lifestyle, I invite you to share your favorite iPhone X accessories in the comments section below.
