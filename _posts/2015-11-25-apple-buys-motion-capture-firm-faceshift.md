* Apple has acquired a Zürich, Germany-based startup FaceShift which provides a proprietary technology for real-time motion capture that was used in the latest Star Wars film and in production of a number of high-profile video games. Apple has officially confirmed the deal in a prepared statement to TechCrunch.
* Speculation is rife as to how Apple might be taking advantage of such a sophisticated motion capture technology in its own products, including potentially using it to power real-time avatars for FaceTime video chats.
* As mentioned, FaceShift’s real-time motion capture allows characters in games and movies to closely mimic the features and facial expressions of human actors.
* “Faceshift studio is a facial motion capture software solution which revolutionizes facial animation, making it possible at every desk,” according to Faceshift’s website which was taken down following news of the deal.
* “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” a spokesperson for Apple told the publication. The site has learned that several Faceshift employees are now working for Apple out of Europe.
* Here’s a video showing off Faceshift’s technology (they provide plug-ins for Maya and Unity) in conjunction with RealSense 3D cameras.
* Apple previously made similar acquisitions related to motion-capture and virtual reality technologies, including buying European startups PrimeSense, Polar Rose and Metaio.
