* Another European reseller is claiming that it’s privy to when Apple’s $159 AirPods wireless headphones will start shipping after German authorized reseller Conrad told a customer a week ago that it would be kicking off AirPods sales tomorrow, November 18.
* French retailer Fnac has apparently started the pre-order process for the wireless earphones.
* Fnac reportedly told customers who pre-ordered their AirPods that the accessory would start shipping on or around Wednesday, November 30, Mac4Ever said Thursday.
* Additionally, AppleInsider has learned that some Apple retail stores already have demo units and are “awaiting word from Cupertino to start demonstrating the product.”
* It seems no one really knows the exact AirPods shipping date.
* If you ask DigiTimes, they won’t start shipping before January 2017, but AppleInsider was allegedly told that there was “no way that these are getting pushed to January.”
* Meanwhile, Barclays analysts believe mass-production is scheduled to kick off in December in time for Christmas.
* Apple originally said that the AirPods would be arriving in “late October” before delaying launch because “we don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready.” The company explained it needed a little more time before AirPods were ready for customers.
* The earphones are currently listed on Apple.com as “coming soon”.
* Each AirPod packs in a six-hour battery, but the included case extends their run time to up to 24 hours before the battery inside the Lightning-outfitted case needs recharging.
* The accessory uses Apple’s in-house designed W1 wireless chip that enables smart features such as invoking Siri by double tapping one of the AirPods, zero-configuration pairing with multiple Apple devices through iCloud and more.
