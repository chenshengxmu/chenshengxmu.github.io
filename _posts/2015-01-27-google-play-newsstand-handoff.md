* Google’s Play Newsstand iOS app (formerly Google Currents) was updated Tuesday with a few new features and several bug fixes.
* The software now implements support for Handoff, a technology Apple built into iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite to make it easy to seamlessly transition between Macs and iPhones/iPads in apps.
* With Handoff support in Google Play Newsstand, it’s now easy to resume reading on your Mac running OS X Yosemite or an iPhone or iPad running iOS 8. Jump past the fold for other changes in Google Play Newsstand 3.1.
* If you bookmark an article, the app will download it to your device so you’ll be able to read it later even without an Internet connection.
* People who use iOS’s Dynamic Type feature will be pleased to know that articles in Google Play Newsstand now honor their font size choices in Settings.
* The Explore tab now includes international topics and the app supports an additional sixteen languages.
* Google Play Newsstand 3.1 changelog:
* The 3.1-megabyte app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Google Play Newsstand free in the App Store.
