* Hot on the heels of Apple’s big HealthKit unveiling comes word that Google is building a health platform of its own. The news comes from Forbes, who says the service—dubbed Google Fit—will be announced at Google’s upcoming I/O conference.
* According to the report, Google Fit will closely resemble HealthKit in that it will collect and aggregate data from popular fitness trackers and health-related apps. And Google is believed to have already forged partnerships with wearable device makers…
* Here’s Forbes’ Parmy Olson with more:
* Google GOOGL +0.12% is planning to launch a new health service called Google Fit to collect and aggregate data from popular fitness trackers and health-related apps, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the company’s plans. […]
* Google Fit will aggregate data through open APIs, instruction sets that allow apps to share information, and will also announce partnerships with wearable device makers at its I/O conference, Forbes understands. One source with knowledge of Google’s plans said Google Fit would allow a wearable device that measures data like steps or heart rate to interface with Google’s cloud-based services, and become part of the Google Fit ecosystem. Google could not be reached for comment at the time of writing.
* This wouldn’t be Google’s first foray into the medical field. In 2008, the search giant launched Google Health, a short-lived collation service for personal medical records. The service didn’t garner much traction though, and Google shuttered it in 2012.
* It’s unclear if Google Fit will be built into the next version of Android, or launch as a standalone app, but it’s sure to tie into the new Android Wear platform. Google has been mum about I/O sessions thus far, but it does plan to talk about wearables.

* Apple, for its part, is believed to be working on a wearable device of its own. The so-called iWatch is expected to feature various health/fitness-tracking sensors, and integrate closely with iOS 8. It’s been reported that the device will launch in October.
* Google’s I/O conference is slated to take place on June 25 and 26.
