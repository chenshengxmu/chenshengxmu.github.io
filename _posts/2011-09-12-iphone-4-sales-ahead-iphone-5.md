* Apple has been building up to a climactic event set to take place in the next 4 weeks. In the past, new iPhone hardware had always been introduced during the summer at Apple’s WWDC conference, but 2011 has proved to be a totally different year in terms of Apple’s product cycle.
* The Verizon iPhone 4 in February helped to throw everything off, and more factors seem to be at play. Apple is up to something different this year, and the company is expected to unveil the iPhone 5 alongside a second model this Fall.
* With all of the rumors and heated speculation, average consumers are still perfectly content with the iPhone 4. In fact, last year’s iPhone model is still selling better than ever…
* You’d think that even the everyday consumer would know that a new iPhone is set to come out soon. But people don’t seem to care. The iPhone 4 is still one of the best smartphones on the market.
* Stern Agee analyst Shaw Wu told AllThingsD that iPhone 4 sales have remained strong and consistent in the months leading up to Apple’s next event:
* “The biggest surprise we are picking up is unexpected strength in Apple’s iPhone business,” Wu said in a note to clients. “The reason why this is remarkable is demand for iPhone 4 remains fairly robust despite it being well known that there will be an upcoming iPhone 5 refresh. We had modeled a sizeable quarter-to-quarter decline to reflect a pause and inventory drawdown ahead of a refresh and we now think this is conservative.”
* It’s been reported that Apple will produce over 17 million iPhone 4s in the last quarter of 2011, and sales are projected to stay strong in the months to come, despite the looming threat of the iPhone 5.
* The iPhone 4 topped the J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey again this year, adding the 6th consecutive win to Apple’s track record. With the products that Apple is set to bring to market soon, the Cupertino company is expected to sell more smartphones than anyone else in 2011.
* It’s been reported from supply chains overseas that Apple is already churning out 150,000 next gen iPhone units per day in anticipation of consumer demand this holiday season. Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley says:
* “During the holiday season, we anticipate strong sales of the iPhone 5, as we anticipate a strong global launch with increased distribution to new carriers including Sprint in the U.S. market.”
* Do you find that your friends and family are satisfied with the iPhone 4? Do you think that people will continue to buy last year’s iPhone after the iPhone 5 comes out in the next few weeks? If Apple lowers the iPhone 4’s price point, the smartphone could continue to sell well through 2012.
