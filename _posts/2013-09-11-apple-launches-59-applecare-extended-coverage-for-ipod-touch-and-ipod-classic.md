* Hot on the heels of yesterday’s iPhone 5s/5c introduction, Apple has quietly brought its premium $99 AppleCare+ iPhone coverage to the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The extended coverage plan – previously limited to customers in the United States, Canada and Japan – covers up to two incidents of accidental damage from handling of your device.
* Not only is Apple taking the AppleCare+ coverage to more places, but more devices as well. Today, we learn that AppleCare+ is now available for two iPod devices: the iPod touch and the iPod classic…
* The new Apple Care for iPod webpage explains that iPod touch/classic buyers can now purchase a $59 AppleCare+ coverage which extends Apple’s standard one-year warranty (with 90 days of free telephone support) for two years of support and coverage.
* Two incidents of accidental damage coverage are included in the plan as well:
* Every iPod comes with a one-year limited warranty and 90 days of complimentary telephone technical support.
* AppleCare+ for iPod extends your coverage to two years from the original purchase date of your iPod and adds up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a $29 service fee plus applicable tax.
* The $59 AppleCare+ for the iPod touch and iPod classic is available now from the online Apple Store in the United States.
* As for the AppleCare+ coverage for the iPhone, the $99 plan costs €69 in France and Italy and £55 in the United Kingdom and covers two occurrences of accidental damage from handling of your device. Apple has also cunningly jacked up the incident fee for iPhone and iPad devices from $49 to $79 – and that’s on top of the plan’s one-time payment of $99.
