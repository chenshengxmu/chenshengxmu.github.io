* Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of Steve Jobs has become Amazon’s best-selling title of 2011. The book made its debut on October 24th, and in less than 2 months it has already outsold many popular titles, including Heaven is for Real by Todd Burpo, and StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath.
* The total sales of the bio haven’t been released, but the book did remarkably well in its first week, selling more than 379,000 copies. You can find the book in a hardcover edition on Amazon or digitally on the Kindle Store. You can also grab a copy on Apple’s iBookStore…
* Sony Pictures has also bought the movie rights to the authorized biography, and both George Clooney and Noah Wyle are reported to be in the running to portray Steve Jobs. No official word on the film has been released at this time, but we hope that it will be just as good as the book, as Aaron Sorkin is also “strongly considering” writing the screenplay for the film.
