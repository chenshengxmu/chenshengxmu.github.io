* Earlier in the day we covered BrowserChooser, a jailbreak tweak developed by Ryan Petrich, which allows you to assign Google Chrome as your default web browser.
* It’s a great tweak, and works exactly as expected; it was even recently updated with a few new additions such as the ability to have a dialogue to select your browser of choice when opening a link, and the ability to make the dialogue sheets say “Open with Chrome” instead of “Open with Safari”.
* One thing BrowserChooser doesn’t do, however, (at least for the time being that is) is allow you to open Home screen shortcuts/bookmarks created via Safari with Google Chrome. Browser Changer is a tweak that’s been around for a very long time, and it was recently updated to allow you to do just that.
* Check out our hands-on walkthrough inside…
* Browser Changer is a free jailbreak tweak that’s available for download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. The tweak will also, like BrowserChooser, allow you to set Chrome as the default web browser for links, and it includes a handy kill-switch for moments when you want to quickly disable the tweak. Along with that, it retains support for many other browsers that you may choose to use as well.
* Which tweak do you prefer? BrowserChooser, or Browser Changer? Both retain the same basic functionality, but there are enough differences that you may want to try each one separately, or maybe even combined. I found that using a combination of both gave me the best of both worlds. You gain the Home screen shortcut Chrome compatibility, and you also update the dialogue sheets with “Open With Chrome”.
* What do you think?
