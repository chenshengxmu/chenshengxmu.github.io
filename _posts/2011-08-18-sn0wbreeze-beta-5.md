* Sn0wBreeze 2.8 Beta 5 has been released by iH8snow for Windows users. This version jailbreaks iOS 5 Beta 5, and also includes a few handy features along the way.
* This is a tethered jailbreak. A notable feature in this release is the abiltiity to install iOS 5 and skip the UDID developer check, meaning you don’t have to be a developer to install the iOS 5 beta (providing you have the firmware downloaded)…
* Here’s the full change log:
* Supported Devices & Tethered?
* Although iOS 5 Beta 5 is fairly stable, we still would not recommend the use of beta software for your personal iDevices. If you have to Google search to learn how to install Apple beta software, you’re probably not intended to have access to the iOS 5 betas.
* If you’re interested in downloading the latest version of Sn0wBreeze, you can find it in our downloads section.
