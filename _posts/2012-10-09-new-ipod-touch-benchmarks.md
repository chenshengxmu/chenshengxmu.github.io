* Folks who pre-ordered, or are thinking about ordering, the new iPod touch might be interested to hear that some screenshots containing purported benchmarks for the device have surfaced.
* If the images are legitimate, then they offer up a few new details about the fifth-gen iPod touch. For example, it appears it has an A5 chip with CPU speeds on par with last year’s iPhone 4S…
* Macotakara (via 9to5Mac) reports that the ARM-based Cortex-A9 Apple A5 chip is a dual-core processor, and has the same clock speed and on-board PowerVR GPR used in the iPhone 4S.
* Its memory, at 512MB, and rear camera, at 5 megapixels, are also on par with last year’s iPhone, suggesting that users can expect the new iPod touch to perform much like the year-old handset.
* The screenshots also confirm that the new iPod touch’s display is the same 1136 x 640 screen Apple is using in the iPhone 5, and that the battery is slightly smaller with 3.7 volts delivering 930mAh.
* In addition to these benchmark photos, it’s worth noting that Apple has posted the official user guide for its fifth generation iPod touch. It’s available as a free download now in the iBookstore.

* Customers who pre-ordered the new touch are reporting that they have started to receive emails that the device has shipped. But Apple’s website still shows a vague ‘October’ estimated ship date.
* Are you planning on getting the new iPod touch?
