* Good news this morning for jailbreakers. Following the release of the new Mobile Substrate for iOS 7, Saurik has updated Substrate Safe Mode to be more friendly with the newer firmware and newer A7 devices like the iPhone 5s and iPad Air.
* For those unfamiliar with it, Safe Mode is what prevents your device from entering a permanent crash cycle by giving you a chance to uninstall problematic packages. And until now, it wasn’t behaving nicely with the Mobile Substrate update…
* Here’s the description of Safe Mode in Cydia:
* “Safe mode is a feature of MobileSubstrate that prevents your device from entering a permanent crash cycle by giving you a chance to uninstall malfunctioning extensions without a complete device restore.”
* Saurik notes that “As of version 0.9.4000 this package is even safer on iOS 7 (and on ARM64).” This is good news, as uninstalling Substrate Safe Mode was one of the steps in our guide to correcting issues folks were having with Cydia Substrate.
* Whether you were having problems or not, I’d recommend updating to the new Substrate Safe Mode. As usual, you should see it listed at the top of the ‘Changes’ section in Cydia. For more information about jailbreaking your iOS device, click here.
* Thanks Luxuria!
