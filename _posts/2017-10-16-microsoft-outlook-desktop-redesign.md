* Microsoft is giving its desktop Outlook apps for Mac and Windows computers a major facelift in order to make the productivity software resemble its iOS counterpart more.
* The Verge reported Monday that the new design will at long last support multitouch trackpad gestures to make email triage faster with features like swiping to delete messages.
* Microsoft admits that “MacBooks are popular amongst key influencers and decision makers,” and that the company “needs to win these users by delivering the best Outlook has to offer.”
* Other changes coming to Outlook for Mac include:
* Among the key aims of the redesign effort, Microsoft wants to reduce complexity and make it easier for new and existing Outlook users to navigate the app.
* The Windows maker is currently testing this design internally. They’ll eventually make it available to Office 365 subscribers first, and then in Office 2019 updates.
