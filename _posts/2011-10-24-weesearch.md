title: WeeSearch- Search Google, YouTube, And Wikipedia From Notification Center

* WeeSearch is a recently released Notification Center jailbreak widget for iOS 5, which allows for YouTube, Google, and Wikipedia searches right from the convenience of Notification Center.
* It’s free, and it works to a certain extent, but it’s obvious that the widget was rushed in its development. It’s missing a few fundamental features, and not everything works as expected.
* Check inside for a full rundown on what’s good and bad about WeeSearch…
* While YouTube and Google searches performed okay for the most part, I had some trouble getting Wikipedia search to work at all.
* Also, there’s no way to simply clear out a previous search term; you actually have to delete your searches using the keyboard’s delete key.
* Lastly, you can’t search if you have a space in your search term. For instance, “SteveJobs” works fine, but try to search for “Steve Jobs” and you get nothing. This can be worked around by using a simple “%20” where the space would normally reside, but no one’s going to want to do that in the heat of the moment.
* If all of that wasn’t enough, it doesn’t appear that the tweak’s touted “slim” mode works either, as you saw from the video.
* In the end, WeeSearch is a jailbreak widget that has tons of potential, but suffers greatly due to its many flaws and oversights. Even though it’s free, I recommending waiting a while for it to be updated, before giving it a go.
* Have you tried it out yet? What did you think?
