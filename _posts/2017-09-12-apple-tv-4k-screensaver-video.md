* Apple is expected to debut a fifth-generation Apple TV with support for the native 4K resolution and streaming, Dolby Vision, HDR10 and more. As you can imagine, the box will come preloaded with Apple’s new default Aerial screensaver shot in the glorious 4K resolution.
* As our own video editor Andrew O’Hara states, an HDR version of this clip isn’t able to be uploaded to YouTube so this is something to keep in mind. Props to Jeff Benjamin of 9to5Mac for first sharing this new screensaver uncovered from Apple’s latest tvOS 11 firmware.

* That looks amazing, don’t you agree?
* This new default screensaver comes in both HDR and non-HDR versions in 4K resolution. The non-HDR version is encoded using H.265/HEVC at 3,840-by-2,160 UHD resolution.
* To fully appreciate the video, watch it on youtube.com in Google Chrome on your desktop and be sure to click the wrench icon in the video’s bottom-left corner and choose 4K (2160p).
* 4K streaming won’t work in Safari so you’ll have to use Chrome. Keep in mind that you must have a fairly speedy system to stream YouTube videos in 4K resolution.
* TIP: to set this video as a screensaver on your Mac, use the free SaveHollywood app.
* How do you like the new Apple TV screensaver and are you looking forward to Apple TV 4K?
