* The jailbreak community has been quiet out of anticipation as we await the completion of jailbreak tools like Electra for iOS 11.0-11.1.2, but some developers continue to push iOS 10-compatible tweaks that hold many of us over for now.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the new jailbreak tweaks that popped up in Cydia this week. As always, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites first, and then we’ll cap things off by outlining the rest afterward.

* Most modern iPhones and iPads come with some sort of biometric authentication like Face ID or Touch ID, but there might be times when you want to turn biometric authentication off temporarily.
* BioLockout is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you do that with an Activator action. From the moment you invoke it, you’re asked to enter a passcode instead. Notably, you won’t be able to unlock with biometric authentication until the passcode gets entered correctly at least once.
* Depending on the situation, this can help prevent someone from accessing your personal information against your will.
* You can learn more about BioLockout in our full review.

* In case you haven’t already heard, there’s a significant new bug in town that impacts most iOS devices running iOS 11.2.5 or earlier. When someone so much as sends you a specific Telugu character via email or text message, it can crash your device and throw it into a boot loop.
* Apple plans to fix this in a future software update for iOS devices, but that isn’t an ideal solution for anyone with a jailbreak. NotTodaySatan is a simple tweak that helps prevent these crashes on jailbroken devices. In other words, an update is no longer necessary to stay safe.
* The tweak accomplishes this by replacing the troublesome Telugu character system-wide with something different. In doing so, iOS never renders the troublesome character, and hence your device won’t crash when someone with ill intentions sends it to you.

* NoWALimitsRevoke: Removes the delete/revoke limit in the WhatsApp Messenger app for all messages (free via CydiaGeek’s repository)
* SpotifyAllowSettings: Unhides some additional options in the Spotify Music app (free via BigBoss repository)
* Most of these tweaks were made with iOS 10 or earlier in mind. Many developers are prepping their tweaks for iOS 11 considering that Electra RC1 will include a patched version of Cydia. Furthermore, Saurik is working on an official update for Cydia and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks to try, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special. We also have a plethora of dedicated roundups that can help you find new tweaks for tweaking your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
