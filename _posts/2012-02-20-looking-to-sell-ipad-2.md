* With Apple expected to unveil the iPad 3 on March 7th next month, it’s time to start thinking about what you’re going to do with your current tablet. As you may know, if you plan on purchasing the new iPad, you can sell your old one to help cover the cost.
* For those of you that are planning on selling your current tablet, you’re going to want to put it up for sale as quick as possible. Because according to Gazelle, a popular electronics re-seller, iPad prices are at their peak right now…
* Gazelle is reporting that rumors of a March-bound iPad 3, accompanied by a possible iPad 2 price drop, have made the current versions of Apple’s tablet popular trade-in items. AT&T 3G models are particularly popular because they can be used on GSM carriers worldwide.
* Interestingly enough, Gazelle has also noticed a 50% increase in Android tablet trade-ins, and — get this — a 25% increase in Amazon Kindle Fire trade-ins over the last month as well.
* The moral of the story is that now is the best time for you to sell your iPad. Gazelle is currently paying out $260 for 16GB iPad 2 Wi-Fi models, and $320 for 3G versions. And if you think that’s low, just wait until your tablet is another generation old.
* Of course, you can get more money out of your iPad if you don’t mind selling it yourself. On eBay, for example, used iPads are bringing in at least $100 more per model than Gazelle is offering. But you can expect these prices to fall substantially by next month as well.
* Do you plan on selling your current tablet to get the iPad 3?
