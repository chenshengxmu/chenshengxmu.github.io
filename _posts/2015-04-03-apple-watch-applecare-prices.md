* While Apple did confirm during its second Apple Watch media event on March 9, 2015 that it will be offering its AppleCare+ extended coverage plan for the wearable device, it did not present pricing for the extended support plans tailored specifically to the Watch.
* Friday, MacRumors shared some purported AppleCare+ pricing information for the Apple Watch models, obtained from a source. According to writer Juli Clover, AppleCare+ for each version of the Watch will be priced differently, with the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition commanding the highest premium in terms of extended warranty coverage.
* Internal screenshots shared with MacRumors, included below, suggest that the following AppleCare+ tiers will be offered for the various Watch models:
* These protection plans will be available for purchase as an add-on from the online and brick-and-mortar Apple Store at the time of purchase.
* They include accidental damage (at a per-incident service fee) and extend standard one-year coverage of the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models to two years from the date of purchase, or three years in the case of the Apple Watch Edition.
* “It is unclear from the information we have received whether band choice will affect AppleCare+ pricing, as band prices vary significantly,” wrote Clover.

* The publication couldn’t determine the veracity of the information given, but underscored that “other sources at Apple” have indicated they are hearing unconfirmed word of similar pricing.
* AppleCare+ is an optional coverage service offered for other Apple products as well. For instance, the $99 AppleCare+ for the iPhone extends your warranty to two years while covering two cases of accidental damage with a $79 service fee.
* Like pretty much every Apple gadget, both the entry-level aluminum Apple Watch Sport and the mid-tier stainless steel Apple Watch will be covered by a standard limited one-year warranty for hardware repairs and 90 days of complimentary support.

* The pricey, gold-plated Apple Watch Edition will treat customers to a higher level of service and will come with a two-year warranty and complimentary 24/7 support.
* I think $59 is a fair price to pay to extend the warrant coverage of the entry-level Apple Watch Sport (which I’ll be buying) to two years.
* What do you think of these prices?
