* Personal Pickup, a handy option which makes it easy for customers to order an Apple product online and have it delivered a few hours later to a specific retail store for pickup, is now available in the following major markets within the European Union: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, as first reported by German blog Macerkopf.de.
* Buyers in the aforementioned countries should see Personal Pickup as an option for supported products during checkout, both at the Apple Online Store and within the company’s official iPhone and iPad shopping application. Some, but not all products can be ordered with Personal Pickup, including the various Mac, iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Apple TV and Apple Watch models.

* When selected, Personal Pickup usually makes a customer’s order available for in-store pickup the same, more rarely the next day. Customers shall be notified via email or SMS when their order is ready for pickup (a driver’s license, a government-issued ID or other photo ID is required).
* The latest expansion of Personal Pickup follows the original launch of the service in the United States back in 2011 and its introduction in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom last month.
