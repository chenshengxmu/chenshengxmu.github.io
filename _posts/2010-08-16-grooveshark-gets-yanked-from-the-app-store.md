title: Grooveshark Gets Yanked From the App Store
---
* Well that didn’t last long, did it? Just this week iDB reported that popular streaming agent Grooveshark had been added to the App Store for download. It was noted that the potential of the rights of music being violated existed, and it seems that very issue is the reason behind the short lived app.

* Mac Life has the direct quote from the companies official blog, which states:
* Earlier this afternoon, Apple sent us a letter notifying us that, due to a complaint they received from Universal Music Group UK, Grooveshark for iPhone has been, strangely, pulled from the App Store.
* This comes as an absolute surprise to us, and we are not sleeping until we figure out exactly how to fix this—and get Grooveshark for iPhone back in the App Store. Above all, our biggest concern is damaging the service we provide to all of you guys—our loyal (awesome) users.
* I have beaten this horse nearly to a corpse, however I feel another jab is in order. How the hell does Apple (again) validate an application without fully knowing if it is even legal? Did the responsible party just think that because Grooveshark’s website runs without consequence, that all the necessary permission slips had been signed? If I were Universal, I would be drafting a threatening letter to not just Grooveshark, but to Apple alike. Maybe that happened, and maybe it didn’t.
* For those of us who managed to get the app downloaded promptly, Grooveshark tells us we should be able to continue to use it without incident. How come? Not that I’m complaining, but it would seem that if anything legit was violated then Apple should pull the plug, which is something they have the ability to do. Right?
* Anyway, I think while the sort the legality of this out, they should figure out how they plan on charging $3 once the 30-day trial is up, without even providing background capabilities. Let’s hope it doesn’t take another year. Until then, enjoy Pandora!
