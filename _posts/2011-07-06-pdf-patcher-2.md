* Now that you are finally able to hack Apple’s latest tablet with JailbreakMe 3.0, what’s your next move? For starters, you may want to consider closing that hole that Comex’s exploit used to break into your iDevice. Think about this:
* JailbreakMe 3.0 is extremely easy to use. You simply navigate to a website on your iDevice, and within a few screen taps you’re jailbroken. But if Comex can design web software that can gain root-level access to your iDevice so easily, why couldn’t someone else?
* Comex’s PDF exploit highlights a very serious security flaw in iOS, and could be extremely dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands.  And wouldn’t you know it, word on the street is that Comex is publishing the JailbreakMe source code online for educational purposes.
* Don’t worry though, just like with his previous jailbreak, the iDevice hacker has provided us with a solution. Along with JailbreakMe 3.0, Comex also released PDF Patcher 2. The utility patches the PDF vulnerability that is used in his new jailbreak tool.
* We highly recommended that you install this utility once you’ve jailbroken. Like most patches, it takes just a few seconds to download and you’ll never know it’s there. After all it’s your iDevice, shouldn’t you use protection?
* PDF Patcher 2 is available in Cydia among the default repos and of course is free.
* Any Questions? Do you plan on downloading PDF Patcher 2?
