* Apple has begun offering a 32-inch Sharp Ultra HD LED monitor in its European web stores. The 4K monitor, which retails for £3,499.00 (or roughly $5,700 USD), has been available since November, but this is the first we’ve heard of Apple selling it.
* The display uses Sharp’s IGZO technology (Indium gallium zinc oxide) and has a resolution of 3840 x 2160. It offers a 1.07 billion color palette, an 800:1 contrast ratio, and comes with DisplayPort support (though it doesn’t include the Mini DP adapter)…
* From the Apple Store description (via MacRumors):
* “With its 32-inch class (31.5-inch diagonal) screen size, 3840 x 2160 high definition resolution and energy efficient edge-lit LED backlight, the Sharp PN-K321 monitor is ideal for professional applications where it’s essential to view detailed information displayed with precision. This super-high resolution display allows you to view the content of four full HD screens on a single seamless display. It also features IGZO* technology, which supports increased pixel transparency and reduced current leakage, thereby making the monitor more energy efficient.”
* And here’s what the side of the display looks like:

* The listing comes at an interesting time, amidst rumors that Apple itself is working on a 4K monitor. Its Thunderbolt Display hasn’t seen an update since 2011, and both its Retina MacBook Pros and its upcoming Mac Pro support the Ultra HD technology.
* But the barrier for entry thus far has been pricing and available content. It’s hard to find anything with a 4K display for less than $2000, though Dell is said to be working on a sub-$1000 model, and there is little media available to consumers in 4K resolution.
