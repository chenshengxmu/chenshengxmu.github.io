* The Internet giant Google on Monday announced its dedicated YouTube application for kids. Dubbed YouTube Kids, the app is now available for the iPhone and iPad as a free download from the App Store.
* Billed as “the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind,” it’s been designed as a safe place for kids to experience YouTube content deemed “kid-appropriate” such as family focused clips.
* Because it’s focused on children, the software includes a set of options that help parents control the experience for their kids.
* YouTube Kids lets your children browse channels and playlists in four categories — Shows, Music, Learning and Explore — as well as search for videos deemed safe for families.
* Curated content includes favorites from DreamWorks TV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends, National Geographic Kids, Reading Rainbow, Thomas the Tank Engine and more.
* “Plus, more new videos are coming soon from beloved YouTubers like the Vlogbrothers and Stampylonghead,” said the search firm.
* Check out the promotional video below.
* Built-in parental controls include:
* The 45-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. The softer is available in the United States, with no word of a possible expansion to other territories.
* Along with the iOS app, YouTube Kids for Android is available in Googe’s Play store and they’ll be soon launching versions for the Kurio and nabi kids’ tablets.
* Download YouTube Kids free in the App Store.
