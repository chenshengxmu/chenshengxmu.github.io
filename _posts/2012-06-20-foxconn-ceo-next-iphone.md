* So this is rather interesting: Apparently Foxconn’s CEO Terry Gou has been sharing some of his famous words of wisdom lately, advising consumers to wait a bit before making their next smartphone purchase.
* Speaking at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, Gou told investors to hold off on buying the new Samsung Galaxy S III, claiming that Apple’s next smartphone would put the handset to shame…
* The China Times reports:
* “Gou also urged consumers to wait for the launch of Apple’s iPhone 5, saying that the new model would put Samsung’s Galaxy III to shame.
* With Hon Hai’s marketing and manufacturing strengths and Sharp’s key technologies, the two will be able to defeat their arch-rival Samsung, the chairman said.”
* That’s a pretty confident statement, to say that a device — which isn’t expected to be announced for several months — is already better than one that reportedly pre-sold more than 9 million units.
* What’s Gou thinking? Perhaps he’s being a corporate cheerleader — Apple is one of Foxconn’s largest partners. Or maybe the CEO has already seen the next iPhone, and is simply speaking the truth.
* Whatever his reasoning, we have to agree that folks in the market for a new smartphone should wait a couple of months before purchasing. With rumors of a larger display, LTE compatibility, and an almost-certain redesign, this year’s iPhone is shaping up to be one of the most significant in the handset’s history.
* What do you think?
