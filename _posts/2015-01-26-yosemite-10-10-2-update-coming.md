* Despite all the talk of a problematic decline in software quality, Apple is feeling your pain and isn’t standing still.
* Currently in testing, a second update to OS X Yosemite is due later this week. First of all, Mac OS X 10.10.2 apparently squashes that annoying bug which manifests itself annoyingly as intermittent Wi-Fi issues.
* Another one resolves a bug preventing your Mac from reconnecting to a Wi-Fi network after waking from sleep, causing you to manually disable and re-enable Wi-Fi, which gets old fast.
* Next, iCloud Drive should be now accessible directly in Time Machine, including the ability to track changes to files and documents.
* Moreover, 10.10.2 prevents the so-called ‘Thunderstrike’ hardware exploit which targets Macs equipped with high-bandwidth Thunderbolt ports and also includes other important fixes.
* The software addresses the recently discovered omission where Spotlight would load remote email content when the preference was disabled in Apple Mail, thus potentially exposing some private data to spammers.

* And most importantly, as iMore discovered, OS X 10.10.2 fixes that nasty Thunderstrike exploit which lets attackers inject malicious code into a Mac’s boot ROM via the Thunderbolt port.
* “To secure against Thunderstrike, Apple had to change the code to not only prevent the Mac’s boot ROM from being replaced, but also to prevent it from being rolled back to a state where the attack would be possible again,” the website explains.
* The Retina 5K iMac and 2014 Mac mini were previously updated with Thunderstrike fixes and now 10.10.2 will fix the problem for all recent Macs running Yosemite.
* And last but not least, the software update will fix three vulnerabilities that Google disclosed via its Project Zero research program.
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman obtained 10.10.2 release notes via Apple employees:
* I just want a way more reliable Safari because not a day goes by that I don’t have to restart my Mac at least twice.
* This is mostly due to Safari eatening up all system resources and refusing to quit or some random piece of web content slowing my machine to a crawl because the WebKit layout engine is riddled with bugs.
