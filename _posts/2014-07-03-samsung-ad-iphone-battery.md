* Samsung’s marketing department is no stranger to Apple-bashing and its most recent advertisement for the Galaxy S5 flagship proves the point.
* Titled ‘Wall Huggers’, it depicts iPhone users in a series of everyday situations with a recurring theme being them chained to a wall socket. “There they are,” the voiceover opens the 60-second commercial.
* “Clustered around power outlets, recycling bins and bathrooms, tethered to the wall.” The ad is embedded for your viewing pleasure right after the break…
* The ad goes to the extreme suggesting that the iPhone’s battery life deprives its users of the “freedom to enjoy even the most basic things” such as “grabbing a drink” or “sharing a laugh with your co-workers” or “sitting with someone you know.”
* It then cuts to a scene depicting a young couple – their iPhones tethered to a wall socket – as a guy expresses hope that the next iPhone will have a better battery.
* The commercial sings praises to a Samsung-developed power-saving software feature called Ultra Power Saving Mode and the handset’s removable battery, both positioned as Samsung’s competitive advantages versus the iPhone.
* Here it is.

* From the commercial’s description on YouTube.
* That moment when your phone conveniently chooses the most inconvenient time to run low on juice. Switch your Galaxy S 5 to Ultra Power Saving Mode or swap in a fresh spare battery and say goodbye to the wall huggers for good.
* Samsung isn’t the first to attack the iPhone’s battery life.
* Back in March, BlackBerry’s then freshly-minted CEO John Chen likened iPhone users to wall huggers because the handset’s battery would run down before the end of the end of the day, forcing them to search for power outlets.
* The commercial will be aired in the United States, where Samsung is trailing Apple.
* Be that as it may, the iPhone’s battery life certainly is a legitimate concern – that’s why iOS 8 includes technologies that help extend battery life.
* For instance, there’s a feature which makes it easier to detect battery-hog apps. Extending battery life is also among the key themes of Google’s upcoming Android L refresh.
* The Google software has a feature called Project Volta which automatically kills apps, shuts off Wi-Fi or dims the display when the device hits 15-percent battery, for an additional 90 minutes of battery life.
* According to a barrage of tests conducted by ArsTechnica, Project Volta in Android L Preview gave their daily-driver Nexus 5 two extra hours of runtime.
* Would you say that the iPhone’s battery life is sub-optimal?
* Abysmal?
* And what’s more important to you regarding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 6, screen size or battery life?
