* It appears, according to several other gadget blogs, that the black version of the new iPhone will be the only one available on launch day.
* The white version will not be offered for another several weeks. In fact macrumors has confirmed that Deutsch Telecom, a German wireless company, will only be carrying the black iPhone as well on launch day.
* What does this mean? Well, for a lot people, myself included, this means we might not be participating in the launch day madness if the white iPhone will not be available. Ever since I saw the white iPhone 3G I have been saying to myself that the next iPhone I get will be white!
* Now it’s not that I’m discriminating against black phones, my current iPhone 3G is black. I think I like the white one because it looks and feels more exclusive, less common than the black one, thus making me look cooler right?
* Hah, truth be told I buy Apple products not for the status but because they make everything I like doing easier. In fact, in a few weeks I will be setting up a small media network with airport express’, possibly a Mac Mini, in my apartment. I’ll keep you posted and will probably detail my experience in an article.
* But the real question here is, do I want to join in on the launch day activities and head down to the Apple Store, and be cheered for as I purchase the black iPhone 4? Or do I want to wait weeks, read other hands on reviews with jealousy while I wait for a white iPhone announcement? What are you guys planning to do?
