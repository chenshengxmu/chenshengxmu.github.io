* Have you ever wanted to know who is sending you a text message or calling you without even looking at your phone? This is when a custom text tone or ringtone comes in handy.
* Whether you want to hear a cheery tone when your spouse texts you or dramatic ringtone when your boss calls, you can set up both of these quickly and easily.
* To assign a specific tone when you receive a text message from a certain contact, just follow these steps:
* 1) Open your Contacts app and select the contact.
* 2) On the top right of the contact screen, tap Edit.
* 3) Scroll down to and tap the Text Tone section.
* 4) Tap your selection in the Alert Tones section. Note: as you tap each alert tone, you can hear what it sounds like. You can also tap Classic at the bottom of the list for additional alert tone options.
* 5) Tap Done.
