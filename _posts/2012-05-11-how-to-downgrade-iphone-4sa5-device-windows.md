* We love our Windows readers and viewers, and to prove it we’ve created a video tutorial that shows you how to downgrade an iPhone 4S or iPad 2 using RedSn0w 0.9.11b1 on Windows.
* The process is basically the same as what we showed you with the Mac version of RedSn0w, but this time around we downgraded an iPhone 4S instead of an iPad 2. The iPad 2, iPhone 4S and the New iPad — all being A5 devices — can be downgraded using this method….
* Note: This particular method only works for A5 devices, and you will need your SHSH blobs saved locally or on Cydia in order to downgrade.
* Important: If you rely on a software unlock or SIM interposer, beware! This method will update your baseband, and you could permanently lose your unlock.
* Step 1: Download RedSn0w 0.9.11b1 from our downloads page.
* Step 2: If you don’t already have the necessary firmware available on your computer, download iOS 5.0.1 (9A405) for your device and iOS 5.1.1 for you device as well.
* Step 3: Run RedSn0w as an administrator and click Extras > Even more > Restore. Under the IPSW section click the IPSW button and select your iOS 5.0.1 (9A405) firmware. Once verified, select your iOS 5.1.1 firmware.
* Step 4: After your firmware has been verified, click the Remote button under the Blobs section. This will pull your blobs directly from Cydia if you have jailbroken and saved your blobs to Cydia in the past. If you haven’t, select local and point to you blobs on your computer if you saved them with a tool like TinyUmbrella. If you haven’t saved your blobs you cannot downgrade.
* Step 5: Now sit back and let your device restore completely. It will start by installing a hacked 5.1.1 firmware, followed by the downgraded iOS 5.0.1 firmware. This takes about 10 minutes so be patient.
* Once these 5 steps are complete, go through your device’s initial setup, and you should be back on iOS 5.0.1. Now you can use the Corona-A5 untethered jailbreak if you wish to do so.
* Were you able to downgrade successfully?
