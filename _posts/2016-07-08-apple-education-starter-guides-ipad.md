* Integrating the iPad into curriculum just got easier as Apple yesterday released a collection of guidebooks on the iBooks Store that its educational teams designed to help educators learn how to use iPads and first-party apps in the classroom. The new Education Starter Guides for iPad series consist of six interactive guidebooks with photos and videos.
* Created and published published by Apple’s in-house Education team, the new e-books are promoted in an email blast to iTunes U users and on the Education section of the iBooks Store.
* The six-series guidebooks are also available standalone, each covering specific topics.
* The iPad Starter Guide, for instance, was designed for educators who are not necessarily familiar with the iPad and in-class deployments. Other educational guides deal with Apple’s first-party apps like the iWork suite and GarageBand.
* Each starter guide is a free download from the iBooks Store via these links:
