* Microsoft has joined Disney’s Movies Anywhere initiative so that customers who made movies and TV show purchases via their Xbox console or Windows 10 system could also access them on Apple devices through iTunes and other linked Movies Anywhere accounts.
* Microsoft is joining the Movies Anywhere service this week, The Verge reported today.
* As mentioned, Microsoft’s own Movies & TV app on Xbox consoles and Windows 10 computers will permit customers to access their purchased content from any supported service, including the likes of iTunes, Google Play Movies, Vudu, Amazon Video and more.
* To get started, simply link your Microsoft Account to an existing or new Movies Anywhere account and you’ll be able to synchronize your movie and TV show purchases.
* Any movies purchased using a Microsoft Account on an Xbox or Windows 10 PC will sync to the Movies Anywhere service and be available on other platforms through the linked accounts.
* For a limited time only, Microsoft will gift a copy of the movie “X-Men: Days of Future Past” to all customers who sync their Microsoft Movies & TV account with Movies Anywhere.
* Not all devices and movie studios support this service, but most do.
* At the time of this writing, for example, Disney, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. were supporting Movies Anywhere.
* Movies Anywhere is a US-only service.
* Have you used this service so far, and if so, what were your initial impressions?
