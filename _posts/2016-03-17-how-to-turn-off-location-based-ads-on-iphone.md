title: How to turn off location-based ads on iPhone and iPad
---
* People who diligently manage apps that are permitted to use their location on the iPhone and iPad may still see the purple Location Services icon in the iOS status bar, indicating something is continuing to use their location—most likely location-based ads which are enabled by default.
* 1) Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* 2) Go to the Privacy → Location Services section.
* 3) Now scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen and tap the System Services entry.
* 4) As the last step, flip the Location-Based Apple Ads switch to the OFF position.
