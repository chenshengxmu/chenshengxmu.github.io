* Following the release of Mac OS X Lion earlier today, Apple pushed an update to iTunes as well by bringing it to version 10.4. iTunes 10.4 was designed to work well with Lion. Among a few bug fixes, iTunes 10.4 gets full-screen mode support with Lion.
* I tested iTunes 10.4 with my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone and I can report that it is safe. So, if you have Lion and see an iTunes update, don’t be scared, you won’t lose your jailbreak…
* “What’s new in iTunes 10.4
* iTunes 10.4 is now designed for OS X Lion.
* You can now use iTunes with OS X Lion’s new Full-Screen App capability, which allows you to use iTunes and other apps without distractions. Navigate between your full-screen apps with a simple gesture.
* Note: iTunes is now a 64-bit Cocoa application on OS X Lion and includes a number of important stability and performance improvements. Some iTunes plug-ins may no longer be compatible with this version of iTunes. Please contact the plug-in developer for an updated plug-in compatible with iTunes 10.4.”
* You can download iTunes 10.4 via iTunes > Check for Updates.
* Have you downloaded iTunes 10.4 yet? Have you noticed any new features worth mentioning?
