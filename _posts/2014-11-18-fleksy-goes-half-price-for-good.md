* Fleksy keyboard, among the first soft-keyboards for iOS 8, broke the Guinness World Record for fastest texting six months ago and now they’ve done it again.
* As announced Tuesday, following September’s release of its iOS 8 keyboard Fleksy has now made the iPhone 6 Plus the fastest phone for typing by clocking in a new typing speed record on the device.
* Brazilian teenager Marcel Fernandes Filho, who is seventeen years old, used Fleksy’s iOS keyboard to break his previous record of 18.19 seconds with a new time of 17.00 seconds.
* Fleksy Keyboard is a 99-cent download from the App Store.
* Guinness’ rules required Filho to type the following standard test message:
* The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human.
* See if you can type that under seventeen seconds.
* With May 2014 and November 2014 Guinness World Records under its belt, Fleksy is now officially the fastest smartphone keyboard in the world.

* And to celebrate breaking a second Guinness World Record for texting speed, developers have reduced Fleksy for Android by 50 percent on a permanent basis, bring the software from the previous price of $3.99 to $0.99.
* Fleksy Keyboard is available for $0.99 in the App Store.
* Note that you should update to iOS 8.1 or the latest iOS 8.1.1 to fix key known issues with custom keyboards and improve your Fleksy experience.

* As I mentioned last week, Fleksy Keyboard can now use  your typing shortcuts as defined in Settings > General > Keyboard > Shortcuts.
* Fleksy combines speed, beautiful design and rich customization options. Featuring a proprietary prediction technology, it’s heavy on gestures such as swiping to delete a character and redo.
* It was the first keyboard to enable blind typing on a smartphone (Access Award by the American Foundation for the Blind), the first keyboard to be deployed on a smartwatch and the first keyboard to enable typing in a 3D augmented reality platform (Leap Motion).
