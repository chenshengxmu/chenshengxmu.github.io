* Starting with the release of iOS 9, Apple has introduced a new standalone application called iCloud Drive. The app acts a document folder of sort, allowing you to access your document created from various applications and stored in iCloud. The iCloud Drive app isn’t installed by default, and you’ll have to enable it for it to show on your Home screen. Regardless of whether it is installed or not, as long as you use the iCloud Drive feature, you are now able to attach documents from iCloud Drive to emails.
* Step 1: Create a new email.
* Step 2: Tap on the screen once to bring up the action menu. Tap on the right arrow until you see the Add Attachment option.

* Step 3: Tap Add Attachment. This will take you to iCloud Drive, from where you can select what document you want to attach to your email.

* Step 4: Select the document you want and it will be attached to your email. If necessary, repeat the process for each document you want to attach.

* Step 5: Finish up your email and hit the Send button. Your document will be sent along with the rest of your email.
* Being able to easily send email attachments without any sort of silly workaround is definitely a nice addition to iOS. Now we just wish we would have the option to embed multiple items at the same time.
