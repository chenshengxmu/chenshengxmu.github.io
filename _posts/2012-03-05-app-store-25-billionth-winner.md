* Where’s My Water? How about “where’s my $10,000 iTunes Gift Card?” That’s likely what a fortunate person from Qingdao, China is thinking after being revealed as the winner of Apple’s App Store Countdown to 25 Billion Apps.
* Winner Chunli Fu’s perfect timing when downloading Where’s My Water? Free yielded a virtual goldmine by App Store standards. Something tells me they’ll have no problem purchasing the $0.99 version of Where’s My Water? now…
* “We’d like to thank our customers and developers for helping us achieve this historic milestone of 25 billion apps downloaded,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “When we launched the App Store less than four years ago, we never imagined that mobile apps would become the phenomenon they have, or that developers would create such an incredible selection of apps for iOS users.”
* This isn’t the first time that Apple has paid out big money in the form of iTunes Gift Cards. Back in January of last year, a woman hung up on a call informing her that she was the App Store’s 10 billionth app giveaway winner.
* Eventually that was all straightened out, and she got her hands on the prize. In that case, the downloaded app was non other than Paper Glider, and guess what; that was free too.
* No photos have been released of Chunli Fu, but if any come to light we’ll be sure to let you know.
