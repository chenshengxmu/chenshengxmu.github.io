* Encouraged by strong response to April’s 99-cent sale of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the Japanese games maker Sega has put in effect a massive Sonic games sale.
* Valid for a limited-time only, as many as seven Sonic releases have been slashed from a few bucks to just 99 cents, including Sonic Jump, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic CD, to mention a few.
* Go past the fold for the full list of discounted games along with their download links…
* The following Sonic iOS titles have been slashed to 99 cents apiece:
* All Sonic titles support iOS gaming controllers.  Note that you can also pick up Sega’s free-to-play Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing Transformed.
* Can’t get enough of Sonic?
* Worry not, Sega is gearing up to launch a Sonic Jump follow-up in the App Store soon and has a brand new Super Monkey Ball game in the works, coming later this summer.
