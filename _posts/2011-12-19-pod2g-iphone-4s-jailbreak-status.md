* For those of you waiting for an iPhone 4S untethered jailbreak, we’ve got good news and bad news.
* The good news is that skilled hacker pod2g is working hard and making definite progress on an iPhone 4S untether. The bad news is that he’s hit a stumbling block on his way to finding a solution…
* From pod2g’s blog:
* The untether fails right now because I’m having processor cache issues.
* I’m close, but I can’t figure out what happens. It certainly has something to do with the multicore cache management.
* Update: pod2g has changed the “multicore cache management” statement to the below:
* I’m close, but I can’t figure out what happens. It certainly has something to do with the Cortex-A9 cache management.
* pod2g says he will have an updated status tomorrow, so there’s no doubt that he’s working mighty diligently to make the 4S untether happen as soon as possible.
* As of now, there is no jailbreak — untethered or otherwise — for the iPhone 4S, but we presume it’s only a matter of time before it happens. If you can remember, it took a similar period of months before we had an iPad 2 jailbreak, and this appears to be a similar situation from a time perspective.
* Are you optimistic that we could see the iPhone 4S jailbreak before the end of the year?
