* Every week, iDB brings you a handful of our favorite device backgrounds in our ‘Wallpapers of the week‘ series. Now, typically these images consist of solid-color graphics, textures, or gradients—a popular post-iOS 7 brush.
* But for those looking for something a little more edgy than all of that, you might be interested in these new wallpapers from iFixit. These hi-res images show the guts of your iPhone 5s or 5c, giving you a sort of see-through effect…
* iFixit, who as most of you know specializes in device teardowns and repairs, posted these two images a few days ago. They’re very hi-res, at 1,280 x 2,272, and they show components like the battery, A7 processor, and more.
* You know the drill: to download these wallpapers, simply tap or click on one of the photos below to blow it up to full size. Then just tap or right-click on the image to save it.

* If you’re interested, iFixit has an iPhone 5 version, as well as internals wallpapers for other Apple devices like the iMac, which you can find here.
