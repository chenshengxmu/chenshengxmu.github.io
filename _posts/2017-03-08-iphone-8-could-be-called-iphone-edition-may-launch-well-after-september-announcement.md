* Japanese blog Mac Otakara is reporting that Apple’s OLED-based iPhone 8 may be marketed under the “iPhone Edition” moniker, saying the flagship handset may hit store shelves well after an announcement in September. The story corroborates prior rumors and analyst reports suggesting that iPhone 8 might launch later than expected and cost upwards of $1,000.
* Mac Otakara expects the LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus iterative updates to go on sale shortly following the announcement.
* The outlet claims that iPhone 8’s features haven’t been finalized as of yet with the exception of three features: wireless charging, dual cameras and a display based on power-sipping organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted iPhone 8 would have an OLED-based screen measuring 5.8 inches diagonally, with a 5.1-inch usable display area and the rest being used for a function area at the bottom providing quick access to virtual buttons.

* As per Mac Otakara, the Cupertino firm is currently testing multiple iPhone prototypes.
* Some of them feature LCD displays while others use OLED screens. Among the prototypes in testing are units with and without Home buttons. Apple is also experimenting with different materials for the chassis, including glass, aluminum and white ceramic, in order to determine an optimal material for mass-production processes.
* Multiple prototypes are reportedly being tested in parallel with engineering validation testing. The Wall Street Journal first said back in November that Apple was prototyping as many as ten different variations of the next iPhone.
* At any rate, marketing its next flagship handset as “iPhone Edition” should signal to would-be buyers that the device is a top-of-the-line model, similar to how Apple Watch Edition is the flagship model in Apple’s smartwatch lineup.
* If you were Apple, how would you call iPhone 8?
