* Great news gamers! Apple has just named Gameloft’s recently-released ‘Asphalt 8: Airborne’ game the App of the Week. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to grab the popular racer for your iPhone or iPad, for free.
* Asphalt 8, which as the name suggests is the eighth installment in the popular racing series, made its debut in late August. The game features over 40 licensed cars, an extensive Career mode, and an impressive physics engine…
* Here’s Apple’s App Store Notes on the game:
* “Each week, we select a great app and bring it to you, for free, as our App of the Week. (In-App Purchases sold separately.) Conquer street and sky in Gameloft’s fastest racing game yet, a mix of high-octane driving and incredible jumps that harkens back to the age of San Francisco Rush and classic Burnout. Pairing white-knuckle action with an array of career and online modes, it sets a new standard for arcade racers on the App Store.”
* And the official Asphalt 8 gameplay trailer:
* Sure, Asphalt 8: Airborne is normally just $0.99, and it does have some in-app purchases (though they aren’t required to play). But we still think that at $0, it’s worth downloading. To find the universal game in the App Store, click here.
