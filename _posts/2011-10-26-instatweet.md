* If there’s one thing we all love, it’s Twitter. There’s just something about those short little bursts of wisdom that compels us all.
* If you’re an iPhone user, you’re certainly not short on choice when it comes to Twitter apps for your beloved phone, so you don’t need another one, right? Well, if it offers something a little different, you just might.
* Instatweet does just that by giving users a fast way to send out tweets in iOS 5…
* Instatweet leverages the new Twitter API that is built right into iOS 5 and simply pulls up the operating system’s Twitter pane. No fancy animations, no bundles of features that nobody actually uses.
* In fact, Instatweet is so bare-bones that there isn’t actually a way to read any of your timeline, it is purely for sending your own messages out.
* That’s why we like it so much.
* When you have the urge to tweet – and let’s be frank, we all do – you just want to get it typed out, or even dictated these days, and have it sent off for your followers to enjoy. Problem is, even the official Twitter app isn’t the quickest, and you have to wait for your timeline to refresh while you’re trying to tap the ‘new tweet’ button. It all takes time, and that’s where Instatweet offers something new.
* For just $0.99, and if you’re a Twitter fan like we are, then you really can’t go wrong with Instatweet. It’s available in the App Store as a universal app for the iPhone and iPad.
