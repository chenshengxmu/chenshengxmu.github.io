* Looking to pick up a new iPad this holiday season? iDB has you covered. We’ve rounded up all of the top promotions going on this Black Friday weekend regarding the popular tablet, so you don’t have to spend hours digging through the sales ads.
* Unsurprisingly, we haven’t seen any deals related to the just-released iPad Pro, but all other iPad models are being significantly discounted. The Air 2 can be found for as much as $150 off, the mini 4 is $100 off, and older models are on sale as well.
* Note that while Black Friday technically starts early Friday morning, many retailers will be open on Thanksgiving night, so look for most of these deals to go live then. In fact, a few promotions are already live, which we’ve labeled accordingly below.
* Best Buy
* eBay
* Target
* Sam’s Club
* Walmart
* Staples
* Stay tuned to iDB for more Black Friday sales coverage.
