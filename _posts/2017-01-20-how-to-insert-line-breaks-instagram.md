* Adding emojis sure is the best way to spice up your Instagram profile, comments, and photo descriptions, but what if you want to go back to simpler things, like adding line breaks?
* Although Instagram doesn’t make it obvious, you can insert line breaks. You just have to know how to do it. In this post, I will show you a very basic trick that will let you insert line breaks inside the Instagram app, for your photo captions and comments, as well as for your bio.
*  
* If you want to insert a line break in your Instagram profile bio, or in a photo caption, or in a comment, you will first have to type that text (line breaks included) in any text editor (I use the Notes app), and then copy/paste that text into Instagram.

* By copy/pasting the text, your line breaks will be preserved and will be visible to anyone visiting your profile, viewing your photo, or reading your comment.
* Not a life changing tip here, but definitely one that can help make your Instagram photo descriptions, comments,  and bio stand out a little bit.
