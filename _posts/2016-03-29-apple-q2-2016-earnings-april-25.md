* Apple has scheduled an earnings call to discuss its second fiscal quarter results for Monday, April 25, 2016 at 2:00pm Pacific Time, 5pm Eastern Time, according to a note on the Apple Investor website. The conference call will discuss Apple’s financial performance during a three-month period ending this month following its lucrative holiday quarter.
* The quarterly earnings statement will be released thirty minutes in advance of the conference call. The company provided revenue guidance of $50 to $53 billion for the quarter and gross margin between 39 and 39.5 percent, prompting concern among investors as these numbers represent Apple’s first revenue decrease in thirteen years.
* We will also get our first glimpse of any potential impact of the new iPhone SE, which goes on sale this Thursday, and the iPad Pro, which launched in October 2015, on Apple’s bottom line. But don’t count on seeing official numbers for the Apple Watch: the company has maintained from the beginning of Apple Watch sales that it won’t be divulging the number of units sold for competitive reasons.
* First and second calendar quarters are typically quiet periods for the company as sales of latest iPhones begin to show decelerate because many people hold off purchasing the handset in anticipation of a new model.
* Apple is widely expected to announce an ‘iPhone 7’ this fall.
* During the holiday quarter, the company moved 74.8 million iPhones and reported $18.4 billion profit on $75.9 billion in revenue.
