* Twitter’s live-streaming software, Periscope, was released in the App Store a week ago and today the app has received its first feature update. Periscope 1.0.1 fixes issues with chat not working sometimes and addresses performance concerns when watching broadcasts with many users.
* Now people you follow who are live-broadcasting appear at the top of your feed, allowing you to jump into the action with just a tap. Video streaming and in-app maps showing broadcaster’s location have been enhanced as well.
* “We’re completely blown away by the reception Periscope has had,” noted developers. “You’ve inspired us to keep building and improving.”
* Indeed, it seems Meerkat’s two-week run in the App Store is coming to an abrupt halt as Periscope takes over. As noted by Dan Fommer, Meerkat’s fall from more than 35,000 tweets per day to 20,000 tweets per day coincides with Periscope’s App Store debut.
