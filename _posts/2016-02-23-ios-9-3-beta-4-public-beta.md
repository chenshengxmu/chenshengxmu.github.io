* A day after it has released a fourth beta of iOS 9.3 and a fourth beta of OS X 10.11.4 to its registered developers, Apple today has made both software updates available to users who are signed up for the Apple Beta Software Program.
* Public beta builds of both iOS 9.3 beta 4 and OS X 10.11.4 beta 4 can be downloaded directly on devices that are enrolled in Apple’s beta program through the Software Update mechanism.
* iOS 9.3 is going to be a significant update with several user-facing new features and improvements including Night Shift mode, password-protected Notes, new 3D Touch actions and much more.
* As for the latest El Capitan beta, it will bring out a few new features such as support for Verizon Wi-Fi Calling, Live Photos, password-protected Notes and an updated Messages app, among other refinements.
* It appears that it’s going to fix the frustrating Twitter link bug in Safari, too.
* Apple also released watchOS 2.2 beta 4 and tvOS 9.3 beta 4 yesterday, the former including a much improved Maps app and the ability to pair multiple watches to a single iPhone via the companion app.
* tvOS 9.3 includes support for Bluetooth keyboards, app folders, a redesigned iOS 9 like app switcher, App Store search via Siri, Dictation input in text fields and more.
* Apple currently does not provide watchOS and tvOS betas as part of its public beta program. The final versions of iOS 9.3, tvOS 9.3, watch OS 2.2 and OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan software updates should release for public consumption shortly following Apple’s rumored iPhone 5se event on March 15.
