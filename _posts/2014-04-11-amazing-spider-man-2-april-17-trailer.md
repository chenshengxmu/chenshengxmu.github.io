* We recently told you about Gameloft’s upcoming movie tie-in mobile game, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Building on the original Amazing Spider-Man, the sequel is said to offer flashier and more detailed graphics, improved controls and of course updated movie-based content.
* Both the game and the movie are slated to land on the same day and now Gameloft’s given us a firm release date: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is coming to iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms next Thursday, April 17, 2014.
* Unlike many triple-As these days, Spider-Man 2 is a premium title, Gameloft has confirmed, so we expect it to cost a few bucks and (hopefully) not include any in-app purchases. Gameloft today posted a new trailer showing in-game action and I’ve included it right after the break…
* Featuring “a massive open-world New York,” the game puts you in the shoes of Spider-Man and involves a combination of action and adventure elements. It’s going to be spiced up with a dose of combo-based fighting, web-slinging, wall-crawling and fluid aerobic combat “like never before on your mobile device.”
* Can’t wait!
* Your character can use special Spider-Man suits, including the Symbiote Spider-Man, Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider, Iron Spider and Superior Spider-Man.
* And this is the original announcement trailer from last month.
* To learn more, check out the game’s official Facebook page.
* Who’s looking forward to playing this?
* I’m not a huge fan of movie tie-ins as they generally suck, but this looks like a really nice game worth playing. I hope they won’t mess up the controls.
