* Apple is introducing a new privacy feature for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV.
* I was installing the new betas on my devices last night and saw for the first time a new screen during Apple’s standard setup process which advertises a new Privacy icon. “This icon appears when an Apple app or feature is asking to use your personal information,” says the prompt.

* Your Apple TV is getting the new Privacy icon, too!
* “This privacy icon gets around that by appearing at the system level—likely in the top menu bar, but that’s not yet clear—when it’s definitely Apple asking you to enter a password or something else deemed personal,” The Verge wrote.
