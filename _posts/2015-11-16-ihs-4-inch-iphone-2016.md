* Apple’s rumored refresh of the four-inch iPhone lineup is yet again being pegged for a summer 2016 launch in another analyst note.
* Kevin Wang, IHS’s Technology Research Director in China, wrote in a post on Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo that the new handset, reportedly branded as ‘iPhone 6c,’ is expected to be released in mid-2016 featuring the same four-inch form factor as the iPhone 5c.
* He did not, however, share other details pertaining to the rumored handset.
* This particular analyst lacks an established track record so take his prediction with healthy dose of skepticism. Earlier this year he said the iPhone 6c would be launching by year-end, with both DigiTimes and Commercial Times picking up the rumor.
* Be that as it may, Wang’s post matches up nicely with a recent note KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent to clients, in which he said that the new four-inch Apple handset will be arriving next year.
* Kuo is adamant that the iPhone 6c will be outfitted with the Apple-designed A9 processor which powers the iPhone 6s, have iPhone 5s-style looks and use Touch ID for fingerprint verification.

* “As there is still demand for a 4-inch iPhone, we believe Apple will upgrade this product line,” Kuo wrote.
* “Because the iPhone 5s is more popular than the iPhone 5c, we think Apple is likely to launch an upgraded iPhone 5s. We predict Apple will mass-produce this new 4-inch iPhone in 1H16 with metal casings. In order to make the current iOS 9 or next-generation iOS 10 run smoothly, Apple may adopt an A9 chip for this new phone.”
* Conspicuously, the device won’t include 3D Touch support, as per Kuo, likely because Apple wants to retain this particular feature as an iPhone 6s exclusive for the time being.
* According to Kuo, Apple’s longtime contract manufacturer, Foxconn, will assemble the forthcoming four-inch iPhone 6c, with shipments estimated to reach 20-30 million units through the end of 2016.
