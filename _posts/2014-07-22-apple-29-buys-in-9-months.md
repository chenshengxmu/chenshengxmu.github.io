* One of the more interesting tidbits from today’s earnings call was a revelation about Apple’s recent acquisitions. Tim Cook said the company has purchased 5 companies since the end of the March quarter, and a total of 29 companies during the past 9 months.
* Apparently these numbers do not include the Beats Electronics deal—Apple’s largest acquisition to date—because it has not completely finalized yet, and isn’t expected to until later this quarter. So who are the other companies? These are the ones we know about…
* Of course, these are all of Apple’s known 2014 purchases, and only Spotsetter and LuxVue were reported on after April. So that means it’s acquired at least 3 companies since April that we don’t know about, and countless others since the beginning of its fiscal 2014.
* Additionally, Cook talked about the Beats purchase today, saying Apple felt it was getting an incredible subscription service, rare talent, and access to a fast-growing headphone business. He also said the firm is still very much in the market for ‘strategic’ acquisitions.
