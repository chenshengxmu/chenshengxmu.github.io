* Responding to the Apple TV 4 launch day and the warm reception the device has received from reviewers thus far, online retail giant Amazon has now removed all Apple TV models from sale on its online stores.
* Earlier this month, Amazon warned customers that it would stop selling both Google’s Chromecast HDMI dongle and Apple’s set-top box in an effort to prevent “customer confusion” over devices that don’t “interact well” with its Prime Video service.
* “Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime,” the company said in an email to marketplace vendors, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg.
* ”It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion.”
* It’s interesting that Amazon did not detail what compatibility problems Prime Video might have. Amazon’s existing Video app for iPhone and iPad supports Prime Video and AirPlay so it’s unclear why the company hasn’t created a dedicated Prime Video app for the new Apple TV (hint: they probably are not excited about sharing 30 percent of subscription revenue with Apple).
* Streaming devices like the Roku, as well as consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, support Prime Video so these devices will continue to sell on Amazon. Prime Video is of course supported on Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices, and on other non-Amazon devices.
* In addition to its own retail stores, the new Apple TV is now available from retailers like Best Buy, MacMall and Target.
* Did Amazon shoot itself in the foot by pulling Apple TVs from online sales?
