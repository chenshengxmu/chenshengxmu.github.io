* According to a report published this morning by DigiTimes, Apple’s suppliers are being told to start preparing materials in order to initiate production of two of their most popular products — the iPhone, and the iPad.
* While it’s obvious that after breaking their normal summer release schedule we’ll see a new iPhone this fall, the iPad 3 news is interesting to say the least.
* Another interesting point of note included in the report, is that Apple will only release one new iPhone instead of the rumored two….
* The sources pointed out that Apple only plans to launch one model of the new iPhone, while iPad 3 has just recently been added to the production schedule with both set to be produced in small volumes in August and the volume will start picking up in September and October.
* The report also notes that the actual launch of the devices will be October, instead of the rumored September launch date.
* This could be true if Apple wants to retain the focus on the iPod lineup for its annual music event, otherwise an iPhone announcement at the event would surely overshadow a new iPod launch.
* To me, an October launch somewhat makes sense, but it’s hard to imagine Apple having an event in September, and then turning around and having another back-to-back.
* As far as the iPad 3 is concerned, some are speculating that Apple will release it early in an effort to fend off increasing competition. To that I say, what competition?
* What do you think about all of the iPhone and iPad rumors? Do you think we’ll see both released this fall?
