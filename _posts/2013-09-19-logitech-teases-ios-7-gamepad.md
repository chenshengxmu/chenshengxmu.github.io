* In addition to its new design, and new features, iOS 7 includes a number of new tools for developers to take advantage of. And one that we’re really excited about is support for third party game controllers.
* Games in iOS 7 will be able to tie into Apple’s Game Controller framework, allowing for the universal use of authorized ‘MFi’ devices. And today, Logitech and others began teasing their first MFi gamepads…
* As noted by MacRumors, Logitech has posted the above photo to its Facebook page, clearly teasing a Made for iPhone controller. And judging by the positions of the hands, this leak from June was spot on.
* Additionally, ClamCase has posted this trailer for its new ‘GameCase’ iOS controller, which connects wirelessly, includes its own battery, and supports all Bluetooth-enabled, iOS 7-compatible devices.
* Unfortunately, neither gamepad is on the market yet, nor do they have ETAs. But if you’d like to get an email when they do become available, you can set that up for Logitech here and the GameCase here.
