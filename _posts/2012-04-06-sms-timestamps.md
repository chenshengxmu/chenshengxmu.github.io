* Want an easy way to track when your text messages were sent or received? SMS Timestamps is a jailbreak tweak that may be up to the task.
* With SMS Timestamps installed, you can force a timestamp to created with every new message, or you can set specified timestamp intervals of 1, 5 or 10 minutes.
* It’s nowhere near a groundbreaking idea, but if you’ve been looking for a standalone timestamp solution, then SMS Timestamps does the job adequately…
* SMS Timestamps is a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you decide to try it be sure to let us know how your experience was.
