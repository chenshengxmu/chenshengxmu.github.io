* We’ve seen a lot of iPhone news reader apps surface in the last month. First there was Flipboard, the popular iPad-turned-iPhone app. And then Zite, another prominent iPad news application, surfaced.
* But my favorite news reader for both the iPhone and the iPad still has to be Pulse. Its image-driven interface is both attractive and user-friendly. And the app just got even better with the latest update…
* Pulse’s update contains several UI enhancements that make the whole app seem much speedier. But where the improvements are really noticeable is in the source discovery screen. This is the part of the app that lets you add news sources.

* You can access it by tapping the Gear icon in the upper lefthand corner of the app, and then selecting Add Source. Thanks to the new update, RSS feeds are now presented in cover flow form. This makes it easier than ever to view and add the content that interests you.
* Finally, the update also adds a new Smart Dock (see above photo) component. This feature recommends news sources to you based on the content you read. It’s tucked out of the way, at the bottom of the app, but if you are ever looking for suggestions it’s there.

* If you want to try the new Pulse, it’s available for both the iPhone and the iPad for free. If you already use Pulse, you can download the new update through the App Store.
* What do you think of Pulse?
