* For those who are unaware, Pangu launched a new jailbreak for iOS 9.2-9.3.3 over the weekend. Now, an iOS developer from the jailbreak scene has made it possible to jailbreak your iOS 9.3.3 device directly from your iOS device itself without the need for a computer.
* It’s officially JailbreakMe-style, and in this tutorial, we’ll show you how to do it!
* This is a semi-untethered jailbreak, which means you have to re-launch the jailbreak app on the device after every reboot in order to make Cydia functional again. Nevertheless, it works like any other jailbreak and lets you customize your device to your liking with jailbreak tweaks and extensions.
* If you’re eager to get jailbroken again, you can now do it right from your iOS device without the need to run any software on your computer. This is especially useful if you don’t have Windows at your disposal.
* To jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 on your device, follow these steps:
* 1) Update your iOS device to iOS 9.3.3. I highly recommend this step because iOS 9.3.3 has all the latest bug fixes and security improvements, yet it can still be jailbroken.
* 2) Disable your passcode and disable Find My iPhone on your device for the greatest chance of jailbreak success.
* 3) Launch Safari on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad and visit the following URL:  imokhles.com/pangujb/.
* Update: developer tells us to use this link going forward:  http://totoateam.com/pangujb.
* Update 2: Previous links are all broken. You may use this link from now on. Screenshots in this post may be slightly different, but the process is identical.

* 4) Tap on the Install button just below the first image on the website.
* 5) You will be prompted to install the jailbreak on your device. Tap on the Install button.

* 8) Tap on the profile that appears here, and then tap on the blue Trust button that appears with the downloaded certificate.
* 9) In the pop-up prompt, tap on the red Trust button, and then go to your Home screen after you’ve successfully trusted the profile.
* 10) Launch the Pangu/PP app and allow push notifications from the app by tapping on the OK button.

* 12) Press the lock button on your device to put it to sleep, and you should soon see a storage getting full notification, as well as a notification from the Pangu/PP app:

* 13) Wait a little while longer, and your device should respring. This is Cydia being added to your device and preparing its filesystem. When it boots back up, you should see Cydia on your Home screen:

* 14) Launch Cydia, and all your repositories will sync so you can start downloading jailbreak tweaks.
* You’re all set! You now have a jailbroken iOS 9.3.3 device without even having to use a computer for any of it!

* The fact that the jailbreak was semi-untethered was a turn-off for many people, but honestly, it’s not that bad. How often do you really need to turn your device off completely anyways?
* Now that you can jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 directly from the device itself, it just makes the jailbreak that much more convenient to perform, and we hope more people who’ve been waiting jump on board.
