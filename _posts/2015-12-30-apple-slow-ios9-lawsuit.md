* Apple is under fire over planned obsolescence concerning the iOS 9 software update, with a new class-action lawsuit accusing the company of intentionally slowing older iPhone models with the update, AppleInsider reported Wednesday.
* Filed with a New York district court on Tuesday, the lawsuit also accuses Apple of deceptive trade practices and false advertising which assured customers that iOS 9 would run fine on older handsets dating back to four-year-old iPhone 4s models without stating that the upgrade would cripple legacy handsets severely.
* “In actuality, the complaint reads, iOS 9 significantly interferes with iPhone 4s performance, and because Apple security protocols prevent users from downgrading, owners were forced to choose between an inoperable device or spending hundreds of dollars on a new version,” writes AppleInsider.
* Indeed, Apple’s advertising, including the official iOS 9 website, hails iOS 9 features such as faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life and other perks, but fails to warn older device owners of potential compatibility issues.
* Plaintiffs wrote that iOS 9 “significantly slowed down” their handsets, “interfered with the normal usage of the device,” exhibited “slow response to touchscreen input” and showed other problems.
* As a result, plaintiffs had to put up with a “slow and buggy” phone that “disrupts everyday life”. The filing claims that Apple through “internal testing and other means” knew that iOS 9 performed poorly on the iPhone 4s.
* They are seeking over $5 million in damages. No hearings have been set at this time.
* Apple’s closed iOS ecosystem, the filing continues, discourages iPhone owners from switching platforms because they cannot use their iPhone apps and nontransferable media on a non-iOS device.
* “When iPhone 4s owners are faced with the dilemma of continuing to use a slow, buggy phone or spend hundreds to buy a new phone, Apple often benefits because consumers will often buy a new iPhone to keep their investment in the App ecosystem,” says the suit.
* The class, which includes more than 100 members, claims that plaintiffs felt that Apple’s planned obsolescence tactics were designed to push them toward spending hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.
* “There is no learning curve and no delays and trouble that accompany new information input,” reads the document. “Thus Apple stands to benefit financially when older iPhones are slowed down and owners are forced to purchase a new phone.”
