* Misfit, a wearable products company, on Thursday announced its most affordable activity tracker yet, the $20 Flash Link, and a brand new Link app that can turn the new activity tracker into a multi-function smart button.
* “We’re focused on making products everyone can use. Flash Link is not just a more affordable wearable, it’s a more powerful one,” said Tim Golnik, Misfit’s Vice President of Product and Design.
* The good news doesn’t stop here as the firm’s discounted its Shine and Flash accessories which now cost $70 and $30, respectively, down from their respective prices of $100 and $50.
* The $20 Misfit Flash Link doubles as an affordable activity tracker and a smart button compatible with the Misfit Link app, much like the existing Misfit Flash. It achieves its low price by using a cheaper plastic, as opposed to the aluminum-clad Shine.

* It offers the same tracking functions like the Shine and the Flash, including activity and sleep tracking, and even resembles the Shine’s design. Unlike the Shine and the Flash that include a bracelet, the Flash Link is outfitted with a handy clip.
* At just $20, the Flash Link is arguably the most affordable multifunctional and modular wearable product on the market.
* The new Flash Link is available for purchase on misfit.com and will be available later in the summer in retail locations worldwide.
* The new Misfit Link app is compatible with both new and existing Misfit Flash devices.
* It can be used to control your Flash or Flash Link wearable gizmo in some interesting ways, basically turning your wearable device into a Bluetooth-controlled smart button which can perform a variety of functions remotely.
* For instance, you can use any Flash to control music (pause, play, skip songs, adjust the volume) in apps like Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Soundcloud or iTunes, advance slides in a presentation and more.
* Your wearable can even act as a remote shutter for your favorite iPhone camera app.

* “Additional functionality is coming soon, including IFTTT and Logitech Harmony integrations,” the company noted in a blog post.
* The new Link app is available free in the App Store.
* The 24.1-megabyte download requires an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later and is optimized for the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes.
* Link for Android version will be released next month.
* For those wondering, Misfit was founded in 2011 by Sonny Vu, former Apple and Pepsi CEO John Sculley and AgaMatrix co-founder and former CTO, Sridhar Iyengar.
