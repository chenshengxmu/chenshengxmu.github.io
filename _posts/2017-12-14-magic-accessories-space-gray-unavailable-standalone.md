* If you fell in love with Apple’s stunning new dark gray finish for its wireless mouse, keyboard and trackpad, you’re definitely not alone as we think they’re badass, too..
* Too bad those who want these stealthier looking accessories will need to buy the newly released iMac Pro, which starts at $4,999 for the baseline configuration, to get them.
* That’s because Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 are for the time being available separately in Apple’s standard Silver finish only. “Space Gray accessories are available only at the time of your iMac Pro purchase,” reads a notice on the Buy iMac Pro webpage.

* As we said previously, Magic Trackpad 2 is an optional accessory.
* Every iMac Pro configuration ship with Apple’s Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse included in the box. However, customers can use configure-to-order features in Apple’s online store to order the computer with a Magic Trackpad 2 (+$50) or the Magic Mouse 2 + Magic Trackpad 2 combination for an additional $149.
* iMac Pro also comes with a black version of Apple’s USB-A to Lightning cable.

* As you know, Apple sells the Lightning cable in standard snow white finish only.
* The black Lightning cable that comes with the computer is used for charging the included Magic accessories. To a trained eye, it’s essentially similar or same as the black cable which the firm ships with certain Beats headphones.
* Should Magic accessories be available separately?
