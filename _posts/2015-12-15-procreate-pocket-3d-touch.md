* Procreate Pocket, an iPhone and iPod touch edition of the drawing and illustration app that started out as an iPad-exclusive, was updated this morning with a bunch of 3D Touch goodies and other enhancements.
* Procreate Pocket 1.6 includes support for pressure-sensitive painting with 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The refreshed app claims double the frame rate across all supported devices and includes an all-new native Apple Watch app on watchOS 2 that improves the battery life and responsiveness.
* Pressing Procreate’s Home screen icon lightly brings up a quick shortcuts menu with two options: New Artwork and New 4K Artwork. Within the app, you can paint with your finger with support for pressure sensitivity on 3D Touch-enabled iPhones.

* In addition, the app lets you use any regular capacitive stylus. With a stylus or 3D Touch, you can adjust the brush size or opacity by adjusting the pressure of your stroke.
* A new two-finger gesture will undo your last action. There’s also three-finger tap Redo, and four-finger tap to toggle fullscreen. On iPhones from the iPhone 5 onward, the app now sports the full toolbar from Procreate for iPad in landscape orientation.
* As a nice bonus, iPhone users can now tap or drag layers while the Alpha Lock feature is now accessed via the Layer Options menu rather than the swipe gesture.
* Procreate Pocket requires an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 9.1 or late. The native Procreate Palette app for the Apple Watch requires watchOS 2 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Traditional Chinese and Turkish.
* Procreate Pocket is $2.99 in the App Store.
