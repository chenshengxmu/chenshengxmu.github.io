* It seems like jailbreak tweak releases are picking up slightly compared to the last few weeks, which is great news for jailbreakers who like to get their hands on new and innovative ways to modify their devices.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the new jailbreak tweaks that made it into Cydia this week. As always, we’ll start by showcasing our favorites, and we’ll outline the rest of them afterward.

* BounceReachability is a slick new animation mod for jailbroken iPhones with Reachability capabilities. After installing this tweak, your Reachability interface exhibits a quirkier bounce animation, like the one shown above.
* The tweak does an exceptional job of adding character to your boring iPhone. Anyone who enjoys tweaking iOS modifications will feel right at home with this tweak; particularly those who use Reachability more frequently than others.
* In our full review, we show you how this compares to the stock Reachability animation and discuss how you can get it.

* HapticTwiter quickly became one of my favorite jailbreak tweaks of all time for the Twitter app.
* This tweak brings haptic feedback to the official Twitter app for iOS, and it does so in a subtle fashion such that you won’t get overwhelmed by constant buzzing.
* You will feel the subtle haptics any time you favorite, re-Tweet, share, or respond to others’ Tweets.
* HapticTwitter works best with the iPhone 6s and later, but a future update will ensure compatibility with older devices as well. In our full review, we discuss how HapticTwitter elevates the Twitter app experience.

* Stylish is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you personalize the look and feel of iOS to make your iPhone look different from everyone else’s. While it’s not as involved as Springtomize might be, you’ll find that it still includes a decent number of options to configure.
* The tweak can modify the look and feel of elements on the Home screen, Lock screen, widgets page, Control Center, and much more. Best of all, you can select the options that you apply, one by one, to get precisely the look you’re aiming for.
* You can learn more about what Stylish can do for you in our full review, where we go over all the tweak’s features and show you each of the options it has to offer.

* That wraps things up for this week’s jailbreak tweak releases, but there are others still in development that should get released soon. As usual, stay tuned to iDB throughout the week to ensure you don’t miss anything you might like.
