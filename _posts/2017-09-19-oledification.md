* OLEDification is a new jailbreak tweak by iOS developer Shyam Lad that captures the notification experience of various devices with OLED displays and brings it to the Lock screen of your jailbroken iPhone.
* Once installed, the Lock screen interface disappears when you receive notifications. Instead, you’re shown an immersive full-screen experience in which the background is dark, and the notification content itself makes up the only color you see on your display.
* From the moment I saw the tweak, it looked reminiscent of the way notifications are displayed on the Apple Watch, just on a larger scale. After some testing, I discovered that my suspicions were right, except that OLEDification includes a few additional features under the hood.
* Above, you can see an example of how the tweak transforms the Lock screen notification aesthetic. The effect is polarizing if you’re used how iOS notifications look out of the box and will take some getting used to.
* OLEDification adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking. As a quick note, all of the settings are enabled by default, so we recommend configuring the tweak before using it:

* Here, you can set up a bevy of options like:
* With the privacy feature(s) enabled, you’ll only see the app name and its respective icon until you perform one of the selected gestures to reveal the notification text, like so:

* It’s useful for deterring snoopers, especially since you’re the only one who will know about the gesture, but some might prefer to keep the privacy features turned off for convenience’s sake.
* Resprings aren’t necessary to save your changes. Everything you change here takes place on the fly.
* Personally, I’m partial to the way iOS notifications look out of the box, but if you think you could get used to the new aesthetic better than I could, then you can download OLEDification for $1.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with all jailbroken iOS 9 and 10 devices.
