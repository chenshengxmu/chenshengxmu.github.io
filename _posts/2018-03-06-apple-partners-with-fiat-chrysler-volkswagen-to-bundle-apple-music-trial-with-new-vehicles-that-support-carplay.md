* Apple has partnered up with Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen to offer a six-month subscription to Apple Music when purchasing a new vehicle with CarPlay. The new promo will start on May 1, 2018.
* If you are already a current Apple Music subscriber, you will only get three free months of service rather than the full six. Don’t worry though, as it equates to the same amount of free time regardless, as Apple offers three months free if you sign up through the Music app.
* If you subscribed through the app already, you get three months free, then another three when purchasing the vehicle. If you haven’t signed up at all, you will get the six months right away.
* This promotion, which runs through April 30, 2019, applies to new Chrysler, Dodge, FIAT, Jeep, or Ram vehicles with CarPlay support for those in the US.
* If you are in Europe, the deal applies to any VW vehicle with CarPlay.
* This is a similar approach to what Sirius XM takes, usually offering somewhat of a free trial period when purchasing a new vehicle that supports it.
* It is important to note that this applies only to individual plans, and not family plans.
