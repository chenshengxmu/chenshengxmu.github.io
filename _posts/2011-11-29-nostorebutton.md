* Apple is really trying to push iTunes music purchases on its customers; evident by the “Store” button located in the upper left-hand corner of the Music app.
* I’ve used iTunes before, but the times I do use it are generally few and far between. This means that the Store button located in the Music app is more of a nuisance than a help.
* If you’re like me and would like to get rid of it, you should try NoStoreButton, a nifty jailbreak tweak for jailbroken iDevices…
* NoStoreButton is as simple as it comes, just installed it, respring, and the Store button disappears.
* I’m certainly not an iTunes hater, it just annoys me when I inadvertently tap the Store button while in the Music app. This will ensure that it never happens again.
* If you’re interested in trying NoStoreButton, you can get it for free on Cydia.
* What do you think?
