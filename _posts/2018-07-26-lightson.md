* If you have an iPhone X or 8 Plus, then you might be familiar with the Portrait Lighting feature that Apple conveniently bundled into your handset’s stock Camera app. It applies professional lighting effects to your photo subject with the help of your device’s dual camera setup and powerful processor.
* The iPhone 7 Plus also sports a dual camera setup and a powerful processor, but Apple uses software to limit Portrait Lightning to the iPhone X and 8 Plus. Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed LightsOn by iOS developer Voltized can fix that.
* Upon installing LightsOn, you’ll be able to access the Portrait Lighting feature on your iPhone 7 Plus from the stock Camera app by swiping to it just like you would if you were switching from photo mode to video mode.
* Portrait Lighting is undoubtedly optimized for Apple’s latest handsets with the A11 Bionic chip. That said, it’s a bit less performance-friendly on the previous-generation A10 Fusion chip. Nevertheless, it’s usable and can yield exciting results in your photos with a bit of practice.
* Notably, LightsOn doesn’t enable Portrait Lighting on any handset besides the iPhone 7 Plus, and this is because of hardware limitations. That said, it can’t port the feature to the iPhone 8, iPhone 7, or older; sorry folks!
* If the tweak doesn’t seem to be working for you after installation, the developer recommends force-quitting the Camera app from your App Switcher and restarting it to solve the problem.
* If you’re interested in giving LightsOn a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak supports all jailbroken versions of iOS 11 and doesn’t have any options to configure.
* Have you tried Portrait Lighting on your iPhone 7 Plus with LightsOn yet? Let us know in the comments.
