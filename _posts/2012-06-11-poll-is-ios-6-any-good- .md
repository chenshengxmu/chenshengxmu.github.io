* Though it’s too early to tell if it’s any good until we get our hands on it, iOS 6 was definitely the star of the show at Apple’s WWDC keynote that just got wrapped up. While we’re still digesting the announcements ourselves, iOS 6 definitely seems to be another worthwhile upgrade.
* Granted, it’s an evolution of the world’s most popular mobile operating system rather than a revolution, but no one said it would be in the first place.
* We also noticed that Apple really stick it to Google with the new Maps app which comes fully loaded with all the features one would expect from a mapping app.
* So what about you, did you like the announcements? Please take a few second of your time to cast a vote in our poll, should be fun…
* So we’re asking whether today’s announcements got blood pumping through your veins?
* Feeling a bit underwhelmed, are we?
* Here, cast your vote.
* Is iOS 6 everything you hoped for?
* We’d love to hear your comments on iOS 6 as well so feel free to join the discussion right below.
