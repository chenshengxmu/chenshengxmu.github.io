* Apple today seeded a third beta of iOS 11 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to its registered developers and members of the Apple Developer Program. To deploy iOS 11 beta 3 (build number 15A5318g), use the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app on your device with an appropriate configuration profile installed, which can be obtained from Dev Center.
* iOS 11 was originally released as a developer-only preview at WWDC in June, followed by iOS 11 beta 2 on June 21 and the iOS 11 public beta on June 26. The first public beta of iOS 11 has the same features as developer-only iOS 11 beta 2.
