* T-Mobile must have rattled some cages when it introduced its $99 iPhone 5 last month, because we’re starting to see more competitive pricing from the other carriers. Sprint is currently offering $100 off the iPhone 5 for new customers, and it looks like Verizon is about to launch a promotion of its own…
* 9to5Mac points to a tweet from its red-hot industry source evleaks this morning that claims Big Red will begin knocking $100 off Apple’s latest handset “mid-month.” The information is pretty vague, but given evleaks’ recent track record with mobile rumors, the potential for savings is definitely worth noting.
* Upcoming Verizon promotion: $100 off iPhone 5 beginning mid-month.

* Assuming the discount applies to all models, it would drop the 16GB iPhone 5 down to $99, the 32GB to $199 and the 64GB to $299. Keep in mind, though, that all of these prices include a new two-year contract with the carrier—something T-Mobile and other regional providers seem to be moving away from.
* Also keep in mind that we are likely just a few months away from Apple unveiling the iPhone 5S. So, despite the deal, it may be worth holding out a little while longer. Reports suggest we will see the next-gen handset, with a better camera and built-in fingerprint reader, sometime between late summer and early fall.
