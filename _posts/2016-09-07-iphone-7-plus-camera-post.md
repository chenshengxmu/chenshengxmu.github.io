* As rumored, the iPhone 7 Plus features a significantly better camera system than that of the iPhone 7. It comes with dual 12MP rear cameras, with a wide-angle and telephoto lens, that make the handset capable of taking noticeably better photos.
* With the two 12MP cameras, the iPhone 7 Plus is capable of 2x optical zoom and 10x software zoom. This means that you’ll be able to get closer to your subject than ever before. You’ll see a new button overlay on screen that says 1x, which you can tap to jump to 2x.

* In addition to zooming, Apple says it gave its engineering team an “extra credit project” regarding the iPhone 7 Plus: depth of field (see ‘bokeh,’ defined as the visual quality of the out-of-focus areas of a photographic image, especially as rendered by a particular lens).
* Coming later this year, the dual 12-megapixel cameras also enable a new depth-of-field effect, using both cameras on iPhone 7 Plus to capture images, while sophisticated technology including Machine Learning separates the background from the foreground to achieve amazing portraits once possible only with DSLR cameras.
