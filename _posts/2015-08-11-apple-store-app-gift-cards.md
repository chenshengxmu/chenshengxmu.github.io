* Apple on Tuesday pushed out an update to its Apple Store app, bringing the mobile client for its online store to version 3.4. The update adds support for making purchases using gift cards.
* In the change log, Apple says “you can now make purchases with an Apple Store Gift Card. Use the built-in Camera to scan new Gift Cards, or import existing Gift Cards from the Passbook app.
* The change is a welcomed one for customers, who previously had no way to use gift cards within the app. Apple often gives out gift cards as part of its promotions, and they are popular gift items.
* Apple has added quite a bit of functionality to its Apple Store app this year. In May, it added support for Touch ID and two-factor verification. You can find Apple Store in the App Store for free.
