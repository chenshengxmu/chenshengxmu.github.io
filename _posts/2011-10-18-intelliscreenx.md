* If you’ve been jailbreaking for a while, you’ll likely recognize the name Intelliborn. The group is responsible for popular jailbreak utilities like MyWi and My3G. Now the talented developers have a new jailbreak tweak in the oven for iOS 5 — and it’s awesome.
* The utility is called IntelliScreenX, and it sits in the new Notification Center found in the latest iOS update. No, it’s not simply a widget. This could take the place of 10 widgets (and so much more). And we just happen to have a video of it in action…
* The amount of features that the developers have packed into IntelliScreenX is incredible. You can do everything from read full emails, to send and reply to tweets, all from within the utility in your Notification Center. And yes, it’s accessible from your Lock screen.
* The guys at Intelliborn tell us that a beta version of the app will be available in a couple of days, so expect Jeff to give us a full walkthrough. The public release of IntelliScreenX should be out in Cydia sometime next week. We’ll keep you updated.
* IntelliScreenX certainly seems like it could be the tweak to have on your jailbroken iOS 5 device. What do you think?
