* Battery Status is a jailbreak tweak that will keep you informed about the status of your iOS device’s battery. Battery Status provides either a spoken or pop-up alert, or a combination of the two — with both outlaying your current battery life situation.
* This $0.99 tweak will tell you how much battery life you have remaining, how much you need to get to 100%, and how long it will take you to get to a fully charged battery. Take a look at our video walkthrough inside for a full synopsis of how it works.
* The settings panel for Battery Status can be used to pick the type of alert you wish to receive: Spoken, Text, or a combination of both, along with the actions required to invoke said alert. There are three actions to choose from: plugging your iDevice in, removing the iDevice from power, and an activator action — which in itself can be a variety of different actions.
* I do wish there were more options for Battery Status, like the ability to make it tell you the status at certain time intervals, or the ability to increase or limit the amount of information spoken to you. Besides that small gripe, I do think it is a well designed tweak, and I experienced no bugs while testing it out.
* For $0.99 on Cydia’s ZodTTD & MacCiti repo, you too can have battery alerts spoken to you. I guess it just depends on how much of a battery hawk you happen to be. I’m usually always near a charger, so I’ll have little use for Battery Status in the real world. But for those who remain concerned about their battery life throughout the day, it is a nice tweak to have at ones disposal.
* What do you think? Would Battery Status help you to batter manage your battery?
