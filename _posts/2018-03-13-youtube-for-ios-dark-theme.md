* Google was spotted testing the Dark theme with a subset of users of the app as far back as late last year. With an optionally darkened interface, the Dark theme is perfectly suitable for late-night video streaming and should look especially good on your iPhone X—even help save the battery power due to the way OLED technology works.

* To enable this new style in YouTube for iOS, tap your account icon in the app and choose Settings from the menu, then select the new Dark Theme option to have the white background swapped with a blacked-out, more cinematic style. This will also invert many of the UI colors.
