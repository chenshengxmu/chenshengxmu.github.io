* Since we first started hearing reports that Apple was working on a smartwatch, designers have been churning out concepts left and right showing what their visions are for the device. And we’ve seen some good ones too, see here and here.
* But this new one from Federico Ciccarese, of Ciccarese Design, might be the best yet. Designed with a flexible touchscreen display, it looks more like a futuristic, high-end fashion accessory than it does a smartwatch, and it even runs iOS 7…

* The name Ciccarese should sound familiar. Federico and co have been responsible for a number of popular past Apple product concepts, including one for the 4-inch iPhone, these life-like iPad 5 mockups and he’s even done an iWatch or two.
* This time around, Federico’s concept is based on Apple’s ‘Bi-stable Spring with Flexible Display’ patent. Much like a slap band bracelet, a popular accessory in the 90’s, the patent calls for a snap-on bracelet with a flexible touchscreen display.
* Rumors regarding Apple’s smartwatch have been plentiful over the past 6 months. Bloomberg says there are over 100 designers working on the project, and multiple reports have claimed the company has brought in outside talent to help out.
* Actual details regarding the device have been slim thus far, but it’s believed that it will run iOS and feature a wide range of sensors for tracking health and fitness stats. There’s also been no word on a launch date, but it’s not expected until next year.
* What do you think of the concept? Would you buy one?
