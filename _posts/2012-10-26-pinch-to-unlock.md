* If you’re looking for an alternative way to unlock your iOS device, there’s no shortage of tweaks available on Cydia for you to do so. In fact, pinch to unlock is a recently released tweak that allows you to do just that. Instead of sliding to unlock, the tweak allows you to perform a two finger gesture as a means to unlock.
* Interestingly, you don’t have to actually perform a pinch gesture in order to unlock your device. Pinch to unlock readily accepts any two finger gesture on your Lock screen as a means to gain access to your device. Check inside for the full video…
* As stated, pinch to unlock can easily accept any kind of two finger gesture on your Lock screen. It’s a very simple and straightforward tweak, with no settings or options to configure.
* If you want to try out pinch to unlock, then take your jailbroken iOS device over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo, where you can download it today free of charge. What do you think?
