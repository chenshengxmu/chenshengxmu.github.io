* In addition to teaming up with World Wildlife Fund on a praiseworthy money-raising initiative, Apple is also honoring Earth Day 2017 with a new activity challenge for Apple Watch owners. MacStories, which first spotted Apple’s notification, explains that Apple Watch owners are being challenged to complete at least half an hour workout on Saturday to earn a new medal in the Activity app and unlock special iMessage stickers.
* “Get outside and celebrate Earth Day on April 22 and earn this award,” reads a message in the Activity app on iPhone and Apple Watch. Apple wants you to go for a walk, run, cycle, wheelchair or swim workout of 30 minutes or more in the Workout app or in any third-party app that writes workouts to Health.
* Do that and you will earn the special award in the Activity app and unlock iMessage stickers for the Messages app. This is Apple’s third special activity challenge. The first challenge was issued was for Thanksgiving, but it was U.S. only.
* Then, ahead of the start of 2017, the company challenged Apple Watch wearers to close all three Activity rings each day for an entire week in January to bag a special “Ring in The New Year” medal and unlock a few new iMessages stickers.
* So, who’s up for Apple’s new Earth Day challenge?
