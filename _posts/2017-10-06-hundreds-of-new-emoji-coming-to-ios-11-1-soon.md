* Apple just announced that hundreds of new emoji will make their way to iOS 11.1 in the near future. Including gender-neutral characters, various clothing options, mythical creatures, and more, these new emoji are adapted from approved characters in Unicode 10.
* These new emoji will debut in a beta preview of iOS 11.1 next week, and will be available to everybody later this year for iOS, macOS, and watchOS.
