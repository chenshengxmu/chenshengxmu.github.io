* Last week, a couple of photos popped up on the web of an alleged next-gen iPad mini with a gold shell. If legit, the leak would seemingly confirm reports that the new tablet will be offered in the same 3 colors as the iPhone 5s.
* But as usual, the underground photos didn’t do a very good job of showing off the device in its entirety—in fact, you can only see the bottom. But never fear, Martin Hajek has drawn up some concepts to give us all a closer look…

* I really like the above mockup because it shows how well a gold-colored iPad mini would pair with the gold iPhone 5s. I do think, though, that the all-gold shell might be a bit too gaudy for my taste. Anyway, back to the Martin show.
* Hajek, a well-known designer with a bulging portfolio of impressive concepts, writes:
* “I’ve been rendering the iPad mini 2 for a while now, even before certain Australian ‘leakers’ showed us that it would come in gold. The question that I asked myself is; will Apple follow a similar S / C strategy for the iPad (mini) as it has for the iPhone 5? In any case – nice to see such a colorful iPad mini!”
* While we’ve seen zero supply chain evidence that Apple is bringing its bright iPhone 5c colors to its next-gen tablet, there was a report from The Wall Street Journal back in July that claimed they were contemplating doing just that.
* I would also call your attention to a recent note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes that in addition to an A7X iPad mini with Retina display, Apple is also working on a cheaper A6 version. And that’d be perfect for 5c colors.

* Of course, this is all pure speculation at this point. Hopefully we’ll learn more soon as Apple is expected to unveil the new iPad mini alongside a redesigned iPad 5 later this month. But for now, let’s just look at the pretty pictures.
* What do you think of Hajek’s concepts? Would you buy a brightly-colored iPad mini?
