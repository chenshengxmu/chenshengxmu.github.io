* In my previous post today I was telling you the Dev Team was working on a patch for the PDF exploit found in iOS and not fixed by Apple on older iPhones and iTouch. The PDF Patch has been released in Cydia for free and you can install it now.
* PDF Patch will fix the security hole that was used by JailbreakMe and could potentially be used to inject malicious softwares on your device.
* If you have updated your iDevice to 4.0.2, there is no point using this patch. However, if you’re still on an older iPhone 2G or iPod Touch 1G, or if you don’t want to update to 4.0.2, then this patch will be for you.
