* Instagram has been testing a Drafts feature with a subset of its users since this summer. Today, the company has rolled out Drafts to everyone. With Instagram Drafts, you can save any half-finished photo edits and work on them later, which is handy for those times you get too busy to pos right away. And if you run an Instagram account for your business, letting your social media manager save a post as a draft makes it easy for you to review it in advance of publishing.
* 1) Tap the Instagram camera in the tab area at the bottom of the screen, then take a photo or video or choose existing media from your library.
* 2) Apply effects or filters, add a caption and optionally tag the post with your location.
* 3) Now tap the back arrow in the top left corner to go back to the filtering and editing step.

* 4) Instagram puts up a prompt asking if you’d like to save the post in your Drafts or discard. “If you go back now, your image edits will be discarded,” reads the message. Tap Save Draft to save the post as a draft.
* If you don’t edit the post, tag people or add a caption or location, you won’t be able to save the post as a draft.
* To see posts saved in your Drafts, tap the Instagram camera icon at the bottom of the screen, then select Library.. Your save posts will appear at the bottom of the screen below the Drafts heading.
* You can keep multiple unfinished posts in Drafts. Any posts saved in Instagram Drafts are stored locally on your device. I’m liking Instagram Drafts so far. The ability to save half-finished photo edits along with any captions and tags in Drafts to work on them later is very convenient, don’t you think?
