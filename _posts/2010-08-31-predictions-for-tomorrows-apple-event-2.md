* Unless you’ve been underneath a rock for a few weeks you’re aware that Apple will be holding their annual September event this Wednesday. With such an event so close, you can pretty much find a rumor for any wild idea you could think of. We figured here at iDB we’d toss around some ideas and let you add your own.
* I’ll start with the casualties:
* The maybe list is always the longest for events like this so I’ll try to avoid taking the middle road as much as I can:
* The new features you can expect to see are always the least interesting because we all figure we saw them coming, but nevertheless here you go:
* All in all this event seems to be fairly predictable, especially with the music insinuated theme that the invitation displayed. Having said that we should all expect one more thing!
* My wild card prediction is the white iPhone 4. Having been eerily quiet the whole month of August about anything related to the iPhone, I can see Apple using a negative such as a late arrival and turning it around as a “look how hard we’ve worked to get you this”.
* I showed you mine now you show me yours. Give us your predictions in the comment box below.
