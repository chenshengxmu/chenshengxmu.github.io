* A couple of days ago, we highlighted FavoriteContacts — a new jailbreak widget that allows you to dial, text, and email your favorite contacts, right from Notification Center.
* Today, we bring you a similar tweak, with a few noticeable differences. Like FavoriteContacts, WeeSpeeddial allows you to dial contacts from Notification Center, but it relies on a custom set of contacts configured in a dedicated settings panel.
* How does this tweak stack up to FavoriteContacts? Check out the video walkthrough inside…
* The answer to that question is “not too well.” For one, WeeSpeeddial forces you to create a whole new set of “favorite” contacts, instead of just relying on the favorites you already have configured in your Phone app.
* Secondly, unlike FavoriteContacts, you can only dial from WeeSpeeddial; as of this writing, there are no options to text or email.
* While WeeSpeeddial is a competent jailbreak widget, FavoriteContacts is vastly more practical for anyone seeking to use it on a day-to-day basis.
* Another point to note is that you can pick up FavoriteContacts for $1.00 on Cydia — $0.49 cheaper than the competition.
* Which widget do you think you’ll prefer? Sound off in the comments below.
