* If the rumors pan out, the fifth-generation iPad should have an all-new design that borrows heavily from the iPad mini, down to the skinnier side bezels, a thin-film touchscreen tech and a much thinner profile. Based on a purportedly leaked iPad 5 backplate, MacRumors has commissioned graphics artists over at CiccareseDesign to create a nice batch of renders depicting how the device should stack up against the iPad 4, iPad mini and the iPhone 5 in terms of the size and industrial design…
* According to MacRumors, the designers worked on the renders based on the leaked iPad shell, which was shown alongside an iPad mini enclosure.
* “We believe the relative sizes shown in the following images offer an accurate view of how the upcoming iPad 5 will compare in size”, the blog wrote.
* The image top of post represents an iPad 5 next to a mini.
* And here it is on top of an iPad 4.

* Notice the slightly narrower appearance and the much skinnier side bezels. If the Japanese blog Macotakara is right, the iPad 5 should be 4 mm shorter, 17 mm narrower and 2mm thinner compared to the iPad 4.
* Another one: iPad 5 vs iPad mini vs iPhone 5.

* Below is the current-generation iPad 4 next to a rumored iPad 5 and an iPad mini. Clearly the upcoming iPad is poised for some design changes in order to fit the look of the iPad mini.

* Most rumors point to the fifth-generation iPad adopting the iPad mini’s anodized aluminum shell with its chamfered edges.
* CiccareseDesign is behind some of the finest mockups we’ve seen in the Apple rumor biz, including this beautiful iPod nano-like iPhone concept, iPad mini renders and more.
* The renders look just about right, don’t you think?
