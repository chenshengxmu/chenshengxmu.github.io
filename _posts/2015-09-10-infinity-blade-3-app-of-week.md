* Heads up gamers, Apple has just named “Infinity Blade III” its App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to download Chair’s epic blockbuster slasher for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving you $6.99.
* As the third and final installment in the brilliant Infinity Blade franchise, this game really needs no introduction. Playing as either Siris or Isa, you are tasked with exploring beautiful dynamic 3D worlds, picking up items and slashing enemies along the way.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* We’re blown away by this incredible conclusion to the Infinity Blade trilogy, complete with two playable chapters, intelligent crafting elements, a new in-depth perk system, and platform-defining visuals. Developer Chair Entertainment has once again proven its skill, meticulously sculpting a beautiful and engaging role-playing game that feels right at home iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
* And a video clip of the game in action:
* If you don’t already own this game, there’s no question that you should grab it while it’s free. Just do it. Even if you aren’t a fan of this genre, you’re still getting a premium title that—despite the fact that it’s two years old—is still considered one of the best available.
* You can find Infinity Blade III in the App Store for free.
