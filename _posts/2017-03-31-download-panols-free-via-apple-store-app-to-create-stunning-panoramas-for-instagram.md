* Apple is giving away Panols for a limited time, a $1.99 savings, but only through its official Apple Store app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Created by Juan Arreguin, Panols allows you to share the panoramic photos taken with your iPhone, as well as other photos stored in your photo library, with Instagram users everywhere. Taking advantage of Instagram’s profile grid, Panols showcases your panoramas to their full effect in the standard three-across display view.
* You can edit the name, description and geolocation of all your photos and be assured that your original photo will remain intact as the app uses a copy for all edits.
* To claim your free copy of Panols, get the official Apple Store app on App Store.
* Launch the Apple Store app, tap the Discover tab at the bottom and scroll halfway down until you spot the Panols offer underneath the Featured App heading. Tap “Download now for free” and you’ll see the screen with basic information about Panols.

* Tap the blue Download now for free button at the bottom. A prompt pulls up, asking if you’d like to finish redeeming your gift inside the App Store app. Tap Continue, then hit Redeem in the upper-left corner of the item’s App Store page.
* Once you’ve successfully redeemed your code, tap Done.
* With Panols, you can split any photo from your photo library into three squares to post into Instagram. With the ability to see metadata information, you can edit and organize your photos with tags, descriptions and titles.

* The app accurately splits your panoramic photos into three separate shots that fit Instagram’s standard three-across display view. And with non-destructive editing, edits to photos sync with your Photos library without effecting the original.
* Here’s a scrollable panorama I posted to Instagram using Panols.
