* When you have the marketing history that Apple does, you don’t anticipate many mistakes. The company has a long list of successful TV spots, such as the popular “I’m a Mac” campaign.
* But obviously, Apple feels it messed up on its latest string of Mac ‘Genius’ commercials. Because it just pulled the three month-old ads from both its website, and its YouTube channel…
* MacRumors makes the discovery:
* “Apple has removed the controversial ‘Genius’ TV spots from its YouTube channel and from the Apple.com marketing page for the Mac…
* …Apple stopped airing the ads on television soon after they were introduced during the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics, with Apple’s ad agency saying they “were intended only for a ‘first run’ during the Olympics.” They remained on YouTube and Apple’s website for several weeks, and only in the past few days were they removed entirely.”
* There’s no doubt that Apple has taken some heat over the commercials, a set of 3 which featured the same male actor playing an eager-to-help Apple Genius. Some folks wondered if it was a good idea for Apple to make its potential customers seem clueless, which it did in the spots. Watch:
* As MacRumors points out, Apple does have a tendency to remove older ads from its website and YouTube. But there are still clips up in both locations from as far back as 2010.
* What did you think of Apple’s ‘Genius’ commercials? Were they bad enough to pull?
