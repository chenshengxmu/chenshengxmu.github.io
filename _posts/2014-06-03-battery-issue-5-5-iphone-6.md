* In the world of iPhone 6 rumors, the narrative thus far has been that Apple is working on two models: one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch display. Both would feature similar specs, much like the iPad Air and Retina iPad mini.
* Unfortunately, for those wanting the latter model, supply chain chatter has indicated that battery issues may push the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 launch into next year. But according to a new report, Apple has solved the issues and is back on track…
* GforGames (via MacRumors) passes along the report from Chinese site Laoyaoba:
* Reportedly, Apple intends on creating an extremely thin device, and in order to achieve this, the 5.5-inch iPhone needs to be fitted with a very slim battery. Sadly, Apple’s main battery supplier, Dynapack International Technology Corporation, hasn’t managed to keep up, but the good news is that Apple has now allegedly teamed up with a different battery supplier in order to beat the odds.
* Based on these fresh reports, Sunwoda is the one who will now have the task of supplying the company with the necessary batteries, and based on these reports, Sunwoda will have the responsibility to produce roughly 20 million batteries (each at 40 yuan -> roughly $6.4 ).
* Previous reports have said Apple is looking to build a total of 80 million iPhone 6 units in 2014. If true, that would mean a majority of them would be of the 4.7-inch model—which, for what it’s worth, was the most popular in our non-scientific poll.
* In addition to larger, higher resolution displays, the iPhone 6 is said to feature a new iPad-like design, a faster A8 processor, an improved camera with image stabilization, and various new sensors. The handset is expected to be unveiled in September.
