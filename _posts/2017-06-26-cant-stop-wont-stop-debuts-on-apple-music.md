* As promised back in April, the hip-hop documentary “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story” has made its exclusive debut on Apple’s music-stremaing service.
* Directed by Daniel Kaufman and available for streaming to all Apple Music members, the documentary chronicles the precipitous rise of Sean “Diddy” Combs aka Puff Daddy and his record label in the mid-90s to the top of the music business.
* To watch the documentary, fire up the Music app on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, then enter the Browse section and tap TV & Movies and find the movie listed there.
* Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music chairman and CEO, said:
* I went to the Bad Boy Reuion concert and thought it was incredible. I think Puff and Bad Boy’s story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he’s at today and the documentary shows that.
* Here’s Apple Music’s official blurb:
* In 1993, Sean “Diddy Combs, a.k.a. Puff Daddy, founded Bad Boy Records and changed popular culture forever. In 2016, the Bad Boy Family reunited in Brooklyn, New York for the biggest homecoming in hip-hop history. Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story explores the passion and personalities behind the empire, and goes inside the making of a movement and the staging of an unprecedented musical event.
* This is an intern-to-CEO story — a raw behind-the-scenes look at the legacy of Bad Boy through a complex portrait of its mastermind as Combs reunites the Family over a frantic three-week rehearsal period. The film traces the label’s emergence in Harlem and Brooklyn, follows its meteoric rise, reflects on the tragic killing of Biggie Smalls, and celebrates Bad Boy’s influence — all while reveling the love and commitment that binds every member of the Family together.
* The film covers the trials and tribulations that Combs faced in putting together last year’s 20th anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows in two weeks time, with artists who hadn’t performed in years. Apple Music will have the exclusive rights to the documentary for at least the next year.
