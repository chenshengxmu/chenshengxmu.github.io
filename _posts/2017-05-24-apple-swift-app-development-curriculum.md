* Apple on Wednesday announced a new app development curriculum targeting U.S. high school and college students who are eager to learn the secrets of mobile app development with the Swift programming language.
* Titled “App Development with Swift”, the new curriculum is now available as a free download from iBooks Store. It’s an extension of Apple’s existing K-12 Everyone Can Code curricula, which has been downloaded 430,000 times.
* Noting that the app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America, Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company is thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding.
* “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love,” said Cook.

* The full-year course focuses on app design and development with Swift, the company’s modern programming language. It includes various Swift Playgrounds exercises and Xcode tutorials, as well as homework projects, a teacher guide with solutions, grading advice and more.
* Starting this fall, the following community college systems serving nearly 500,000 students nationwide will teach the new curriculum, among others:
* Houston Community College will be opening an iOS Coding and Design School to teach the new curriculum.
* “We are thrilled Apple is offering this incredible opportunity to advance student learning, which will especially help us bridge the gap in computer science training for minorities and women,” said Houston Community College Chancellor Cesar Maldonado.
* “We can’t wait to see what these students will do and already have local businesses offering mentoring and internship opportunities.”
* Apple says that select high schools will teach the curriculum as well. At many campuses, local businesses will also offer students mentoring and internships, added the firm.
* More than a thousand schools across the US plan to teach with Everyone Can Code materials in the fall. Feel free to check out Apple’s existing free coding materials on iBooks Store.
