* Apple raised more than $20 million this holiday season to benefit Product Red, an organization that partners with companies to fight AIDS in Africa.
* Recode obtained a copy of an email from Apple CEO Tim Cook to employees on Wednesday, congratulating them on their charitable work, which now totals $100 million total to Product Red in recent years.
* “I’m thrilled to announce that our total donation for this quarter will be more than $20 million — our biggest ever — bringing the total amount Apple has raised for (PRODUCT) RED to over $100 million,” Cook wrote. “The money we’ve raised is saving lives and bringing hope to people in need. It’s a cause we can all be proud to support.”
* This holiday season Apple partnered with major app developers to donate proceeds to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. A portion of Apple’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales were given to the cause, Apple Stores displayed a red Apple, and Apple gave away free gift cards with the purchase of select products on Black Friday to raise awareness.
