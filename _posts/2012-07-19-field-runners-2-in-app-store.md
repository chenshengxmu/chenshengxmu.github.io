* Nearly four years ago, a tower defense game by the name of Fieldrunners landed on iOS. The game was an instant hit, and has since been ported to a number of other platforms and consoles.
* Last night, Subatomic Studios returned to its roots, and released Fieldrunners 2 in the App Store. The long-awaited sequel includes upgraded graphics, and several new gameplay elements…
* From the app’s release notes:
* “The fieldrunners are back! With legions of soldiers and a gaggle of new tricks, they’re ready to conquer the globe. Or so they think! Our top scientists at SubaLabs have built a bleeding-edge arsenal of devastating weapons for any heroes willing to stop these dastardly invaders.”
* And if that’s not enough to pique your interest, here’s a list of some of the game’s new features:
* It looks like the folks over at Subatomic have another hit on their hands. At the time of this writing, the game already has 75 reviews, and 5 stars from over 100 ratings.
* Word is that the iPad version is still in the works. But for now, you can grab Fieldrunners 2 for your iPhone and iPod touch from the App Store, for $2.99.
* Have you tried Fieldrunners 2 yet? What do you think?
