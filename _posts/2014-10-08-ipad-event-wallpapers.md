* As with all Apple event invitations, we rush to provide you with a way to celebrate on your own device! Almost right on cue, we were able to receive wallpapers from our consistent iDB reader, Jason Zigrino. The imagery is extremely simple in this invitation, unlike some other more developed invites. The term “It’s been way too long” will certainly keep some armchair analysts awake at night pondering over its hidden meaning.
* We are fairly certain the event will contain new iPads and some second device, which leaves people guessing Apple TV, new MacBooks, iMacs, or maybe retina iMacs. Currently, the guessing game is available for anyone to play, as the invitation leaves everything open for interpretation.
