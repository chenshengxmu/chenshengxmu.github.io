* The City of Cupertino has released a new set of high-resolution technical drawings for Apple’s upcoming ring-shaped Campus 2 facility. The official documents depict the iSpaceship building, including underground parking space for nearly five thousand cars and a massive auditorium where Apple will hold media events.
* So if you thought past media events were magical and spellbinding, Apple’s future press conference are bound to knock your socks off once Campus 2 officially opens some time in 2015…
* The City of Cupertino just released a new set of renderings and drawings related to Apple’s Campus 2 facility.
* These include the following material, provided as downloadable PDF documents:
* We noted last month that the all-glass structure won’t replace Apple’s main corporate headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California. Instead, it’ll become research facility office space for an additional 13,000 employees and will provide an additional 300,000 feet of expansion space for future growth.
* One of the intricacies detailed in the newly released drawings include a massive underground auditorium with just one purpose we can think of: media events.
* So come 2015, when the building is scheduled for completion, this is where Apple will likely hold keynotes to announce future products.
* Here’s this auditorium.

* You can see the stage, backstage and auditorium sections on the left and a huge circular exhibition space on the right.
* And this below is the cross-section look at it.

* Architectural design is credit to four design studios: London-based Fosters + Partners, San Francisco-based Arup North America, Philadelphia-based OLIN Landscape Architecture and Urban Design and Santa Clara-based Kier & Wright.
* More information about the Apple Campus 2 project can be found at the official City of Cupertino website.
* If these drawings are anything to go by, Apple’s future media events are bound to capture audiences worldwide unlike any other venue before.
* Agreed?
