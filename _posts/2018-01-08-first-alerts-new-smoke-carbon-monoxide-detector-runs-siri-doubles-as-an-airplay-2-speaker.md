* First Alert’s latest HomeKit-compatible OneLine Safe & Sound smoke and carbon monoxide detector will be upgraded with AirPlay 2 support upon availability, allowing users to enjoy multi-room audio and manage music playback through the Home app.
* First Alert already has a few HomeKit compatible products on the market.
* Their new device works with Apple’s HomeKit framework, allowing you to get notifications and trigger scenes which are based on the air quality in your home.
* The accessory includes a built-in speaker that First Alert says delivers omni-directional audio with “crisp vocals and powerful bass.”
* It also supports multiple voice assistants via its integrated noice-cancelling microphones, letting you ask Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri or Google’s Assistant different queries even when you’re speaking over the sound of music.
* Though obviously they cannot build Siri directly into the device itself, Apple users still get a neat feature in the form of upcoming AirPlay 2 compatibility.
* As you know, AirPlay 2 is currently unavailable. Once Apple releases it, First Alert says, the new protocol will be added to the OneLine Safe & Sound line so users could control multi-room audio through the stock Home app on their iOS devices.
* The new in-ceiling accessory from First Alert should be available in April, priced at $249.
