* The Notes app on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac is a handy little app for jotting down notes of all kinds. So, if you use the app to keep private notes that you want to make sure no one sees, there’s an easy way to keep them secure. You can set up a password for the Notes app on your devices in just a few steps and here’s how.
* 1) Open your Settings app.
* 2) Scroll to and tap Notes.
* 3) Select Password.
* Enter the password you want to use, enter it again to verify it, include a hint in case you forget it, and optionally enable Touch ID. Tap Done.

* Once you set up a password in the Notes app, any note you create and lock will require that password to view.
* 1) With the note open, tap the Share button.
* 2) Select Lock Note.
* 3) Enter the password you created to lock the note.
* 4) Tap OK.
* You will see a confirmation that the lock was added. The note will remain unlocked until you finish with it. Then, tap the lock icon from the top.

* 1) With the note open, either click the Lock button from your toolbar or click File > Lock Note from the menu bar.

* Keep in mind that the password you set will not apply to all notes created. You must go through the steps to lock the note for it to apply.
* Notes that are locked will display with a lock icon next to them on both iOS and macOS.

* Setting up and using a password with the Notes app on any of your devices is simple. And remember, if your Notes app is synced with iCloud and you lock a note on your iOS device but then want to view it on your Mac, you’ll need the password you set up when you originally locked the note on iOS.
* Do you use the Notes password feature for certain notes?
