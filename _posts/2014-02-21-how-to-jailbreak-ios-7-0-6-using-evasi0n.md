* iOS 7.0.6 was just released earlier today, and it contains a fairly serious SSL bug fix that everyone should upgrade to. Unfortunately, the latest build of Evasion7, build 1.0.5, is not yet compatible with iOS 7.0.6. But don’t worry, we have you covered. We’ve uploaded a custom Hex-edited version of Evasi0n7 1.0.5 with the proper build numbers so that you can easily jailbreak iOS 7.0.6 after updating. Check out our full video tutorial after the jump for the proof.
* Update: the evad3rs have released evasi0n7 1.0.6 with support for iOS 7.0.6, so the hex-edited file is no longer needed, you can download the proper Evasi0n 7 1.0.6 file from our downloads page. Note that the steps described in this post still work. Just make sure to download the latest official version of evasi0n7.
* The first thing you’ll need to do is download our hex-edited version of Evasi0n7 from our downloads page. You can rest-assured that this file is fine. It was downloaded directly from evasi0n.com and hand-edited by yours truly with Hex Fiend, a hex editing utility for OS X. This means that this tutorial, as of right now at least, is only for Mac users, but we will hopefully have a Windows file and tutorial in the near future. The same premise applies to whatever OS you use, however. All I did was update the supported build number in Evasi0n7 to support iOS 7.0.6.
* Step 1: Download Evasi0n7 1.0.6 from our downloads page
* Step 2: Connect your iOS device running iOS 7.0.6 to your Mac
* Step 3: Double click on Evasi0n7 to run. It should recognize your iOS 7.0.6 device
* Step 4: Click jailbreak and follow the on-screen instructions
* Step 5: Once the jailbreak is completed find the Cydia icon on your Home screen and open it to setup your device
* Jailbreaking iOS 7.0.6 is extremely straightforward, and it’s highly recommended that you update to this latest firmware issued by Apple due to the security implications. If you have any questions or comments, leave a note down below.
* Have you updated to iOS 7.0.6 on your device yet? If so, do you plan on jailbreaking?
