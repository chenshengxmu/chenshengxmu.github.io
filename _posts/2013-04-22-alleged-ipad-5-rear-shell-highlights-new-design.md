* Case maker Tactuc is on a roll lately. After the vendor, in what some people likened to a PR stunt, last week released a batch of photos purported to depict a polycarbonate shell for a rumored less-pricey iPhone model, the company is back at it today with a new leak claimed to represent the rear shell of a fifth-generation iPad. There isn’t much to glean from the photograph and, of course, we have no way of telling whether or not this is the real deal, an early prototype or a shell for some other product. However, the image does bear resemblance to iPad molds Tactus leaked earlier…
* Tactucs posted the new photo Monday on its blog.

* The blog post also mentions the rumoured A7X chip, an eight-megapixel iSight camera, the choice of 16/32/64/128GB storage and a 9.7-inch Retina screen based on Sharp’s IGZO technology that uses up 90 percent less power compared to the traditional LCD IPS tech.
* Apple are finally supposed to be using IGZO displays with their retina resolution screen, which means a thinner iPad is definitely on the cards.
* And here are the alleged iPad moulds Tactus leaked earlier in the month.

* The shell appears to be consistent with another leak from January, right down to the mic opening on the back and the slimmer and sleeker design, depicted below.

* Most rumors point to the iPad 5 adopting the iPad mini’s design, including the skinnier side bezels and chamfered edges.
* Now, Asian vendors tend to have some well-informed sources who provide them with manufacturing specifications for Apple devices, so they could build and sell cases for new Apple products from day one.
* That being said, however, due to a lot of guessing work involved readers are advised to take such leaks with a few pinches of salt.

* Accessory manufacturer MiniSuit, for example, made an iPad 5 case based on specifications received from what it believes to be a reliable source, seen above.
* The iPad 5 is believed to incorporate a new display assembly design which calls for reducing the size of LED backlighting to allow for a thinner and lighter appearance.
* Apple is believed to have delayed upcoming iDevice launches until Fall amid various technical and manufacturing challenges and a fire at LG Display’s subcontractor’s plant.
* Most recent supply chain talk points to a July-August timeframe for iPad 5 production.
