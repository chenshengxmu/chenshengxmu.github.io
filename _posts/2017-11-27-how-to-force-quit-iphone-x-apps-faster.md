* Force-quitting apps on iPhone X is a multi-step procedure.
* First, you must swipe up from the bottom edge of the display and pause in order to bring up iPhone X’s app-switching interface. Next, you must swipe to find the app you’d like to force-quit and then tap and hold its card until the minus sign appears—only then can you actually kill it.
* Thankfully, you can shorten this convoluted process a bit.
* If you’re currently using an app, you can force-quit it as follows:
* 1) Swipe up from the bottom edge of the iPhone X display and pause to show the app switcher.
* TIP: Alternatively, swipe right from the bottom left corner of the display at a slight upward angle or swipe up and over in one continuous motion in order to enter the app switcher.

* This undocumented gesture takes some time getting used to, but do give it a try. Once you master it, you’ll be able to access the app switcher on your iPhone X faster than before.
* 2) With the app switcher activated, let go of the finger then tap and hold the app card until the red minus sign appears on all the cards. Without releasing your finger, drag the card upwards in one continuous motion to force-quit the app immediately.

* This method doesn’t require that you let go of the finger after the minus sign appears.
* As we’ve said many times before, there is typically no reason to force-quit an iOS app unless it misbehaves badly or drains your battery excessively. As Apple itself acknowledges, force-quitting apps that function properly doesn’t save battery power.
* The old app switcher let you force-quit multiple apps at once.
* Here’s how to do that on your iPhone X.
* 1) Swipe up from the bottom edge of the iPhone X display and pause to show the app switcher.
* 2) Tap and hold the card of the first app you’d like to kill until the minus sign appears in the upper-left corner of all the cards in the app-switching interface.
* 3) Without releasing the finger, hold up to two additional fingers on any adjacent cards you’d like to dismiss, then swipe up simultaneously.
* That’s how you force-quit up to three apps at once.

* This works in both portrait and landscape mode.
* TIP: Swipe left/right across the Home indicator to quickly switch between apps.
* To boost your productivity further, you’re wholeheartedly recommended to memorize a secret gesture for faster app switcher access on iPhone X (swipe right from the bottom left corner of the display at a slight angle) and another one for summoning Reachability more easily (swipe up an inch or so from the bottom edge before swiping down without lifting the finger).
