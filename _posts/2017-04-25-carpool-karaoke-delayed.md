* “Carpool Karaoke”, Apple’s first original series based on the popular segment of “The Late Late Show” with James Corden, has been officially delayed until later this year, Reuters was able to confirm Tuesday. The show was supposed to make its debut on Apple Music this month and Apple has even created a star-laden trailer for it ahead of launch.
* According to Reuters’ sources, a premiere party for the series was originally scheduled for March in Los Angeles, but got postponed without explanation days before it was to take place.
* After rescheduling the launch party, Apple unexpectedly postponed it again this week.
* In a statement issued to media, the Cupertino company has confirmed that “Carpool Karaoke: The Series,” as the show is officially called, will premiere on Apple Music “later this year.” A CBS spokesperson said they look forward to everyone seeing the show later this year.
* Apple’s adaptation of “Carpool Karaoke” features a different host every episode and revolves around various celebrities riding along in a car together as they sing different tunes.
* Some of the celebrities scheduled to appear on the show include Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena and Shaquille O’Neal.
* Apple has another incoming show—“Planet of the Apps”—focused on apps and their creators which should premier on Apple Music this spring, barring any unforeseen delays.
