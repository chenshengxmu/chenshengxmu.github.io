* In the interesting Korea Times article we mentioned earlier today, a Samsung executive was quoted in saying that the company was looking to ban all iPhone 5 sales in Korea once the new device launched.
* He claimed that Samsung was going to take Apple to court over its violation of the company’s patents related to wireless technology. But thankfully, the senior level executive didn’t stop there with the information…
* The source went on to say that Apple’s new smartphone will feature an LG display, an LG Innotek 8 megapixel camera, and an NFC (Near Field Communications) chip. The executive also confirmed it will make use of a Samsung-made A5 processor.
* I’m pretty sure that violates some kind of non-disclosure or trade agreement, but we’re glad he did it. This is the second time in the last 5 days that NFC technology has been mentioned as an iPhone 5 feature.
* Last week, The New York Times quoted an Apple employee as saying the upcoming smartphone would support the wireless payment platform. I don’t know about anyone else, but buying gas with my iTunes-connected iPhone sounds strange.
* What do you think about NFC?
