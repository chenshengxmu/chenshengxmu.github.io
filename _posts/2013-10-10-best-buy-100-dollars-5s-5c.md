* It appears that Best Buy is on the verge of launching another smartphone trade-in promotion next week. According to a new report, the retailer will begin offering a minimum of $100 for select older, working handsets.
* The catch here is that this trade-in money must be used to purchase a new iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c at the subsidized price—meaning you’ll have to sign a new two-year agreement with one of Best Buy’s carrier partners…

* TechnoBuffalo has more details:
* “A trusted source has provided us with a screenshot of an internal Best Buy document that states the retailer will be running a promotion from Oct. 13 to Oct. 19 that will allow you to trade-in select smartphones and receive a minimum of $100 in credit. The phones must be in working condition and be free of cracked screens or water damage to qualify.”
* The site warns that as with all promotions, not all stores will be participating. And, it says, your trade-in value may be impacted by original packaging or accessories, so make sure to take everything you have with you when you go.
* Best Buy has already run a number of trade-in promotions this year, and at one time it was offering a free $50 gift card with the purchase of an iPhone 5c or 5s. But it appears that it has ended that deal as it prepares this new offer.
