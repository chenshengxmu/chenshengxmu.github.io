* Apple’s chain of retail stores have seen unprecedented success over the past decade. They make more money and see more foot traffic than just about any other store on the planet.
* Unfortunately, more foot traffic means longer wait times and other inconveniences for shoppers, which can lead to a poor customer experience. But Apple is looking to change that…
* 9to5Mac is reporting that it has learned about several new changes coming to Apple Stores in the near future, in an effort to “streamline” the customer experience and trim wait times.
* Among these changes is a completely redesigned Concierge Genius Bar application that will make it easier for employees to check in customers and view upcoming appointments. The app also features an all-new Session Manager system that will streamline the way Genius Bar employees are assigned customers, which should effectively reduce wait times.

* While these changes might not seem like a big deal, they should equate to a much better retail experience both for shoppers and those looking for help with their Mac or iOS devices. And as evident in its latest round of TV ads, Apple is clearly looking to step up its game in this particular area.
* The first of these changes went into effect yesterday, and several more are expected to roll out on August 6th.
* What are your experiences with Apple Stores like? Good, bad?
