* With Apple holding an iPhone event next Tuesday, 4th of October, the world’s tech press is gearing up for a busy week of announcements and reactions. Apple will be holding its event at its main campus in Cupertino, California, meaning that members of the press living outside the United States are out of luck.
* Unless they happen to be in the UK, that is…
* MacRumors reports that the Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden (one of the largest Apple stores in the world) has been told to close early this Tuesday. The store will livestream Apple’s iPhone event from California for the UK press to attend. It’s not the first time Apple has streamed a keynote across the pond, but it’s the first time they’ve decided to use one of the company’s stores as a venue.
* “Hello Team,
* As we begin to start a very exciting quarter in Apple Retail, I am pleased to let you know that our Covent Garden Store will be hosting a keynote streaming event next Tuesday 4th October. This event will be a press only event and currently we have no further details on what will be presented. The store will be closing at 3.30pm to accommodate this.
* This is a really exciting event for our store and we are passionate about delivering an outstanding Covent Garden experience.”
* Apple clearly believes that whatever its going to announce is important enough to warrant closing one of its busiest stores. Bearing in mind the Covent Garden store usually closes its doors at 9PM, that’s quite a bit of potential customers Apple could be losing. With over $60 billion in the bank, we’re sure Apple can take the hit, though.
