* As suspected, Apple today announced a refresh to its all-in-one desktop, refreshing the 21.5-inch model with a brand spanking new screen with 4K resolution versus a 1080p screen on the previous-generation model.
* In addition, the Retina 5K display is now available on every 27-inch iMac as Apple has removed the non-Retina 27-inch models from sale.
* The updated all-in-ones come outfitted with more powerful processors and graphics, two Thunderbolt 2 ports and new storage options that make the high-performance Fusion Drive even more affordable.
* Last but not least, the Cupertino firm has refreshed its keyboard, mouse and trackpad accessories with rechargeable batteries, Bluetooth 4.0 networking and more, with the Magic Trackpad 2 featuring Force Touch technology.
* “From the first iMac to today, the spirit of iMac has never wavered — deliver the ultimate desktop experience with the latest technologies, gorgeous displays and cutting-edge designs,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

* “These are the most stunning iMacs we’ve ever made. With our gorgeous new Retina displays, more powerful processors and graphics and all-new Magic accessories, the new iMac continues to redefine the ultimate desktop experience.”
* In addition to improved screen technology, the refreshed iMacs run faster chips for even smoother performance than before.
* The new 21.5-incher with Retina 4K display features a fifth-generation Intel Core processor and enhanced Intel Iris Pro Graphics.
* The 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display is powered by Intel’s sixth-generation Core processors (the latest “Skylake” platform) and the latest AMD Radeon R9 discreet graphics that deliver up to 3.7 teraflops of compute power.
* Both models now feature a pair of Thunderbolt 2 ports by default and 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking supporting a theoretical maximum of up to 1.3Gbps wireless data transfer speeds.
* In addition, customers can now configure their Fusion Drive with a 1 TB hard drive and 24 GB of flash storage or a 2TB/3TB HDD with 128 GB flash storage. Previously, Apple’s 1TB Fusion Drive was a 1TB hard drive with a 128GB SSD. All-flash 256GB and 512GB storage options are available as build-to-order choices through the Apple Online Store.
* The new 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display has a screen resolution of 4,096-by-2,304 pixels, resulting in a total of 9.4 million pixels. That’s 4.5 times more than the standard 21.5-inch iMac display.

* By comparison, the previous-generation 21.5-incher had a 1080p screen maxing out at 1,920-by-1,080 pixels, which works out to a little more than two megapixels.
* On the downside, the standard $1,499 model has a 5,400 RPM 1TB Serial ATA hard drive. Upgrades to a 1TB or 2TB Fusion Drive are available for $100 and $300, respectively.
* Its bigger sibling, the 27-inch iMac, now features a Retina 5K display across all models. As before, the Retina 5K screen maxes out at 5,120-by-2,880 pixels resulting in a stunning 14.7 million pixels, or seven times more pixels than an HD display.
* These new Retina screens feature even more advanced technology than before, offering a wider P3-based color gamut that provides a 25 percent larger color space. As a result, the new iMacs have more available colors to render than standard sRGB screens, resulting in images that are more vivid, with greater detail and more lifelike colors.

* Both the 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display and 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display are available today at Apple.com, Apple’s retail stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* The 21.5-inch iMac is available in $1,099 and $1,299 flavors, while the new model with Retina 4K display is priced at $1,499. The 27-inch iMac comes in three models starting at $1,799, $1,999 and $2,299.
* Every new iMac comes standard with the new $99 Magic Keyboard and the $79 Magic Mouse 2. The new $129 Magic Trackpad 2 is an optional purchase.
