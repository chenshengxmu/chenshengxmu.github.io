* Apple Music has passed 50 million paid and free trial accounts combined.
* The fresh new data point was revealed by none other than CEO Tim Cook during his interview with Bloomberg Television earlier this morning.
* The previous milestone was revealed about a month ago when Cupertino’s music-streaming service passed 40 million paying accounts and eight million people on a 90-day free trial.
* By comparison, Spotify had 75 million paying subscribers as of March 31, 2018 and a combined 170 million listeners if you add up everyone on Spotify’s free ad-driven tiers.
* While the Cupertino technology giant still has to cover a lot of ground before it will be in a position to overtake Spotify, Apple Music has been growing slowly but surely and is now projected to match or surpass Spotify before year-end.
* It would be unfair to Spotify not to mention that Apple Music has the key advantage of being heavily promoted and seamlessly integrated into Apple’s ecosystem.
* Thanks in part to the strong rise of Apple Music subscriptions, Apple’s managed to rake in a whopping $9.1 billion revenue in services revenue last quarter, a 31% year-over-year boost.
* Which service is better, Spotify or Apple Music, do you think?
