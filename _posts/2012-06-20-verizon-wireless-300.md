* One of the most common questions we get asked regarding the third-generation iPad is, “which carrier should I go with?” Here in the US, the tablet is available on both AT&T and Verizon networks.
* Depending on you’re location, we generally recommend the Verizon model. The carrier has had its LTE network up and running for nearly two years. And it’s now available in more than 300 markets…
* Verizon Wireless announced today that, thanks to its latest round of LTE rollouts, its 4G network is now available in more than 300 US markets. That’s almost 10x the size of AT&T’s LTE footprint.
* But at least AT&T is in the game. Neither Sprint nor T-Mobile have yet to launch their LTE networks. Sprint is expected to do so sooner rather than later, but T-Mobile appears to be waiting until 2013.
* LTE coverage is starting to become fairly important to iOS device owners. Because not only does Apple’s latest tablet support the 4G technology, but the company’s next smartphone is expected to as well.
