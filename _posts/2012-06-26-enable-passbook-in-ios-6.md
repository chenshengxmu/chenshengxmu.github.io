* One of the more intriguing iOS 6 features that Apple announced at WWDC was the new Passbook application. The app is essentially Apple’s first go at a digital wallet.
* But unfortunately, Passbook is broken in the developer beta — it’s just a splash screen. So there’s no way to play with it. That is, unless you follow these few easy steps…
* All that you need for this tutorial is an iPhone on iOS 6 beta 1. Yeah, unfortunately it looks like the beta 2 update Apple released yesterday broke Passbook’s APIs. But you’re still welcome to try it, of course.
* Step 1. Launch Safari on your iOS 6 device and visit passsource.com. This website will allow you to create Passbook passes, for free.
* Step 2. You’ll see several fields where you can customize the card’s info, but we just left everything as default, and pressed Create.
* Step 3. Once you tap Create, a preview of the pass will pop up. Press the Add button in the top right hand corner, and then open Passbook. Voila!
* Obviously, the passes aren’t usable or anything. But it’s still cool to play around inside the application — it seems very well done. We particularly like the ‘delete-a-pass’ animation:
* Passbook’s success will ultimately depend on whether or not companies use it. But after playing with it for a little bit, it seems like they’d have to be crazy not to. It’s so simple.
* What do you think?
