* Apple on Monday shared a trio of new videos through its official YouTube channel, titled ”Safe”, “Ease” and “Apple Support,” inviting Android people to switch to an iPhone.
* The videos highlight the strong security and foundation of iOS, plus the free Move to iOS app for Android devices that makes it simple to move music, photos and other items to an iPhone.
* “Upgrade to iPhone,” Apple says in the description. “The Move to iOS app makes it simple to move your music, photos and more to iPhone. Switch today.”
* “Frequent iOS updates help keep your iPhone more secure. Life’s easier on iPhone.”
* As you can see for yourself, these newly shared videos follow the previously established format for the “Switch to iPhone” campaign and, unlike the previous ads from the series, are shot in portrait orientation.
* Additionally, Apple Support shared a similarly-themed video through it own channel highlighting the fact that iPhone buyers also get support from a real person.
* “Get world-class support from a real person at an Apple store, on the phone or online.”
* “iPhone is assembled in facilities that send Zero Waste to landfills,” Apple writes.
* The new video clips link to Apple’s webpage dedicated to switching.
* How do you like these new advertisements?
* Let us know in the comments!
