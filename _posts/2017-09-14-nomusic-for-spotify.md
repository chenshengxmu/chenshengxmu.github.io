* The Spotify app keeps a running history of all the things you search for; on the other hand, not everyone wants to have their search history recorded.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed NoHistory for Spotify by iOS developer Squ1dd13, you can prevent the Spotify app from remembering your previous searches.
* Once installed, you’ll no longer have to waste time and energy clearing your search history manually because the tweak takes care of everything automatically behind the scenes.
* Working as a history management engine for someone who would regularly clear their search history manually, it’s a convenient add-on if you don’t want others knowing what you jam to on your free time.
* Admittedly, I don’t really don’t have a problem with people seeing my music search history myself, but some people out there take their privacy to whole new levels and might find this tweak fitting for them.
* For example, some people get embarrassed and defensive when you tease them for listening to Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber; but everyone’s different and will have their own motives to hide what they do.
* Use of NoHistory for Spotify requires the free Spotify Music app from the App Store, so it won’t work with any other music app on the iOS platform.
* If you’re interested in trying NoHistory for Spotify, it’s a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices. The tweak doesn’t have any options to configure, so it’ll start working right after you install it.
* Do you have a reason to hide your music search history? Share why in the comments!
