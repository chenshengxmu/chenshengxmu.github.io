* Apple again was named the most-innovative company. For the ninth year in a row, the iPhone maker topped a survey of senior executives polled Boston Consulting Group.
* South Korea-based rival Samsung was No. 2 and Android’s Google was listed as No. 3. Microsoft and automaker Toyota rounded out the top five…
* “But measuring innovation remains difficult, and BCG doesn’t ask survey respondents to explain exactly how they’re defining it,” reports the Wall Street Journal.
* “The bar is continuing to rise for what it means to be a world-class innovator,” says Andrew Taylor, a BCG partner. The survey polled 1,500 senior executives for the most-innovative companies outside their industry.
* Three-year stock performance, revenue and margin gains were also considered.
* Other tech firms making the top 20 list of innovative companies include IBM (No. 6), Amazon (No. 7), Sony (No. 11), Facebook (No. 12) and HP at No. 16.
* Of course, this isn’t the first time this year Apple has been crowned as innovative. Earlier, Apple was listed in 79th place by Forbes, a drop from previous years. However, Apple increased in standings among the Fortune 500.
* By proxy, Apple’s latest iPhones and new operating system have shined prestige upon the company that until recently some felt had lost its mojo. First, Apple announced selling 9 million new iPhones during the first weekend the handsets were available.
* Then iOS 7, controversial for its flat redesign, was named the most user-friendly mobile operating system, as well as lightening fast adoption rates.
* Turns out, defining “most-innovative” may be easier than first thought.
