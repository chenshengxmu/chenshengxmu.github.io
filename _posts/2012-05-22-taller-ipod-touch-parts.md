* Reaffirming the widely reported and credible rumor claiming the next iPhone will sport a taller four-inch display, a part leak has surfaced today indicating that the next iPod touch will also adopt a taller, 3.95-inch display.
* As you can see, a claimed front panel from the next-generation iPod touch is taller compared to the current-generation iPod touch which has the same 3.5-inch Retina display like the iPhone 4/4S. This particular part measures in at 4.1 inches diagonally and has a hole for the physical home button right where you’d expect it…
* It was leaked by a parts supplier and MacRumors got hold of it.
* The publication also pointed to the home button flex cable and front and rear camera parts, seen below. These are said to belong to the next iPhone, though they warn a supplier hasn’t yet confirmed their authenticity.

* Unfortunately, the image is too small and we couldn’t decipher what the label says in order to eventually determine the camera brand.
* It’s been assumed the next iPhone will increase the back camera resolution to at least ten megapixels, but thus far no evidence emerged to substantiate this specualtion
* Back in January, Sony unveiled a new tiny 13-megapixel CMOS image sensor with HDR Video that could be a perfect fit for an ultra-thin iPhone 5.
* Here’s a demo of the HDR Movie function it provides
* According to a press release, Sony’s new CMOS uses their unique “RGBW Coding” function which allows images to be captured with low noise and high picture quality even in low-light conditions. The new  HDR (High Dynamic Range) Movie function allows brilliant color to be captured even in bright settings.
* 9to5Mac today chimed in with some new info pertaining to the iPhone 5, or whatever it ends up being called.
* The publication has it on good authority that Apple is already testing prototypes of the next iPhone which sport a 3.95-inch display with a 1,136-by-640 pixel resolution.
* Despite concerns that changing the form factor will break third-party apps, developers reportedly aren’t too concerned, believing Apple will either use the extra pixels for new interface controls or provide tools to make the transition as painless as possible.
* In theory, most apps would automatically adapt themselves to a taller representation by simply scaling up their content canvas a bit. Only graphics-intensive 3D games would need to be re-written with a taller display in mind.
* We should find out more about the next iPhone at Apple’s annual developers conference, which kicks off on June 11 at San Francisco’s Moscone West.
* According to our poll (take it now), nearly one in two readers wouldn’t object to a four-inch iPhone whatsoever, while one in five preferring a 4.3-inch display like on the Samsung Galaxy S II.
* Excited?
