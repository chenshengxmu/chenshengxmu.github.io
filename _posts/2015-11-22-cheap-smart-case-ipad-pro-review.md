* Earlier today, I got my hands on the JETech Smart Case for iPad Pro. The JETech is an uber-cheap iPad Pro case offering that’s currently available for purchase on Amazon.
* As you’re probably aware of, Apple hasn’t produced an all-in-one Smart Case solution for the iPad Pro. Instead, users wanting full 360° coverage will need to opt for both a Smart Cover and a Silicone Case. That combination, while certainly premium feeling, also comes with a premium price at around $140 before tax. In contrast, I was able to pick up the JETech case for a hair under $10.
* The JETech isn’t perfect, but its exceptionally low price will tempt more than a few iPad Pro adopters. Of course, you do tend to get what you pay for, so should you even bother?
* After unpacking and using this case with my iPad Pro for a few hours, I can easily recommend it. My recommendation primarily stems from the fact that this thing is $130 less than the equivalent case/cover combination that Apple sells! But it’s also decent enough to where many of you may deem it to be a solid purchase.
* The cover portion of the case features a soft-touch pseudo-suede cover, similar to the official Smart Cover, with the inside featuring micro fiber-like material to keep the iPad Pro’s glass protected. The case, which the iPad Pro snaps into, isn’t as nice feeling. The outside of the case features the same soft-touch material, but the inside of the case, the portion of the product that the iPad actually comes into contact with, is made of hard brittle plastic.
* My main complaint with the JETech case is that its lip doesn’t cover the entire perimeter of the iPad Pro. The lip does cover the corners and the landscape edges of the tablet, but leaves the top and bottom portions exposed to the elements.

* My second concern is more on the nit-picky side of things. The speaker hole cutouts sit too close to the speaker grills on the iPad Pro. It’s hardly noticeable, and just a fractional overlap, but it’s still not a clean cutout. If you’re not overly picky about things like this then you probably won’t even notice, and I don’t think that it will have any bearing on sound output.
* The bottom line is that the JETech costs way less than the official coverage solutions from Apple, and at the end of the day, most will find this case to be adequate.
* If you feel like your iPad Pro only deserves the best and most premium protection that money can buy, then obviously opt for Smart Cover+Silicone Case combo from Apple. For those of you looking for the cheapest way to sufficiently protect your iPad Pro, then the JETech case isn’t a bad option, and it’s available in more colors than just black and white.
* Again, you can purchase the JETech for less than $10 on Amazon. What do you think? Would you consider buying it?
