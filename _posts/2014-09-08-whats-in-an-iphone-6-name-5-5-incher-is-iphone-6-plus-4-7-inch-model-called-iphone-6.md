* According to the Japanese blog MacOtakara [Google Translate] Monday morning, Apple will use ‘iPhone 6’ and ‘iPhone 6 Plus’ monikers with respect to a 4.7 and 5.5-inch edition of the upgraded smartphone.
* The French blog NowhereElse.fr said last week that the bigger iPhone 6 model will be marketed under the ‘iPhone Air’ moniker. Unlike ‘Air,’ Apple’s never used the ‘Plus’ suffix to market an iPhone, or any other product for that matter. If true, this’ll be a first.
* The article calls for the same iPhone 6 colorways as its iPhone 5s counterpart, meaning Space Gray, Gold and Silver finishes. There should be three storage sizes — 16, 32 and 64GB — though the author cautions that he heard absolutely nothing about the rumored 128GB tier.
* Just to be sure we’re on the same page, Macotakara is credited with accurately predicting the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c names last Fall.
* For the sake of completeness, Macotakara — at least to my knowledge — was the first publication to have called for a five-inch iOS device with a high-resolution display, and that was as far back as March 2012.
* MacOtakara has a decent track record, but I’d still take the report with a grain of slat. At least to me, the ‘iPhone 6 Plus’ moniker just doesn’t have that familiar Apple ring to it.
* Thoughts?
