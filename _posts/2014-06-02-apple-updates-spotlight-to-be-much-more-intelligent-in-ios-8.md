* Like its OS X brethren, Spotlight has been updated in iOS 8 to be more intelligent. As it stands now, Spotlight is pretty bland, dumb and can only search for apps and content stored directly on your device.
* In iOS 8, Spotlight can provide live search suggestions for apps, Wikipedia entries, movies, songs from iTunes radio, news and more. Itâ€™s a much more powerful way to perform smart searches on iOS.

* Prior to iOS 8, Spotlight would not perform live searches out on the web to update you with dynamic search suggestions. Taking the cue from OS X Yosemite, Spotlight just go a whole lot more useful in iOS. What do you think about Spotlight in iOS 8?
