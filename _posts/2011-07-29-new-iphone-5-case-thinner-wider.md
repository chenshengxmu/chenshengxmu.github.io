* There have been a lot of rumors floating around about the iPhone 5, especially this close to the alleged launch date. The rumors have been that new iPhone will be slimmer, have a bigger screen, and have a curved design.
* With all the leaked iPhone case pictures making the rounds, it certainly seems that way. Today we have new pictures from 9to5mac that give you a pretty good look at the potential design…

* The pictures indicate that it will indeed be slimmer as well as wider, and feature a curved design. The ringer select is on the opposite side of the volume keys which is a change from the previous models.
* According to 9to5Mac’s sources, the case is 5 inches tall and 2.8 inches wide. The iPhone 4 is 4.5 inches and 2.31 inches wide if that gives you any idea on the size difference.
* What do you think of these specs? Is a bigger iPhone a better iPhone?
