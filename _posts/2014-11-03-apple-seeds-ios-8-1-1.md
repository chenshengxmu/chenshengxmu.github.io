title: Apple seeds first iOS 8.1.1 beta to developers

* Apple has seeded the first beta of iOS 8.1.1 this evening, with build number 12B432. The release comes just a few hours after Apple pushed out the first beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.1, and roughly two weeks after it officially launched iOS 8.1 to the public.
* Folks who are jailbroken may want to hold off from updating, until it’s clear that this won’t hamper the Pangu Untether in anyway. Otherwise, feel free to check it out, although you’ll likely disappointed—we’re not expecting much more than bug fixes here.
* We’re currently installing the beta, though, and will update this post if we find anything. If you notice any changes from previous versions, be sure to email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a comment below, preferably with a screenshot of the change.
* Additionally, Apple has also released new beta software for Apple TV.
