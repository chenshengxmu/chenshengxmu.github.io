* Another Sunday, another opportunity to show you what’s new in Cydia for the week!
* Ranging from free to paid, this week’s jailbreak tweak releases in Cydia have been few and far in between; that is, until the Updates tab blew up over the weekend with tons of new releases. Still, there have been some noteworthy releases that we think some jailbreakers will get excited about; others will improve security, and some are even utilitarian.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you everything that’s new in Cydia this week, and we’ll also be pointing out our favorite releases.

* Meteor is my favorite jailbreak tweak release this week; it allows you to see your weather information right from the Weather app’s icon from the Home screen. The app icon will show the temperature outside, as well as the weather conditions.
* You can configure the update interval so this tweak is as battery-friendly as you’d like it to be, and you can even have Weather information shown in the Status Bar.
* For more information about how Meteor works and the options you can configure to make it work how you’d like it to, you can check out our full review.

* QuickClear is another great jailbreak tweak that was launched this week that makes it really easy to clear any notification badges you might have on apps with a 3D Touch gesture. From the Quick Actions menu, this tweak lets the user remove those badges with a single tap of a button.
* I find that this implementation is much less intrusive than BadgeCleaner, and it’s well-built to suit the 3D Touch menu. Since 3D Touch only appears when you invoke it, it’s not going to bug you every time you launch the app like BadgeCleaner would.
