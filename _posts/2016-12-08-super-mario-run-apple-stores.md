* Ahead of its scheduled December 15 debut, Nintendo’s upcoming platformer Super Mario Run can now be experienced firsthand in your local Apple Store. That’s because the iPhone maker has installed Super Mario Run demo stations at its brick-and-mortar retail locations for pre-release play, as announced during Wednesday evening’s “The Tonight Show” starring Jimmy Fallon.
* “I feel like Mario was what introduced millions of people to video games and interactive entertainment, and I think that Mario will continue to serve that role,” Miyamoto told The Verge. “And I think with Super Mario Run that’s exactly what’s going to happen.”
* In Super Mario Run, players tap anywhere on the screen to make Mario jump (the longer you tap, the higher Mario jumps). Wednesday evening’s “The Tonight Show” starring Jimmy Fallon showed off a playable version of Super Mario Run for iPhone.
* The video below features President of Nintendo of America Reggie Fils-Aimé who can also be seen debuting the Nintendo Switch game system by playing The Legend of Zelda in front of creator Shigeru Miyamoto.
* Super Mario Run, an endless runner, features Nintendo’s signature Mario graphics style. Similar to the game mechanics in games like Canabalt, Super Mario Run has you hitting various obstacles, clearing gaps and jumping to avoid obstacles.
* Super Mario Run will be free to download, with an optional one-time $9.99 In-App Purchase to unlock all three game modes (sign up via the App Store to be notified when the game launches or download Super Mario Run iMessage sticker pack). One of the game modes is Toad Rally where you must collect as many coins as possible while trying to beat the “ghost” of your competition.
* If you want to get an early taster of the upcoming game, visit your local Apple Store and give Super Mario Run a whirl ahead of its December 15 launch on the App Store.
* Engadget has a hands-on of the game, if you’re interested to learn more about it.
