* Some new photos surfaced this afternoon, showing what is believed to be a partially assembled iPhone 6. We’ve seen shots of standalone parts, like the front panel and rear shell, but this is the first time we’ve seen what they look like put together.
* Assuming the parts are legitimate, these photos give us the best look we’ve seen thus far of Apple’s latest flagship smartphone. The iPhone 6 is much thinner than its predecessor, with rounded corners, and various aspects of it have been redesigned…

* Today’s images come from luxury modified iPhone vendor Feld & Volk (via MacRumors), who has been responsible for several leaks in the past. The firm claims it has an in with some Apple suppliers, enabling it to get a head start on modifications.
* In terms of design, there isn’t much to talk about here that we haven’t seen already. Gone are the two rows of tiny speaker/mic holes alongside the Lightning port, in favor of a single row of larger holes, and the two volume buttons have been elongated.

* Other design differences we continue to see in the leaked parts include a relocated Power button, which has been moved from the top of the device to the side to make it easier to access on the larger handset, as well as a rounded (not pill-shaped) rear flash.
* Obviously these parts are in pretty rough shape, and the finished product will be far more polished, but should the current consensus hold true, the iPhone 6 should greatly resemble what you see above. Yeah, Apple’s September 9th event can’t come soon enough.
