* Apple’s mobile payment service is pushing into e-commere with news that the Cupertino company is partnering with Volusion, an e-commerce platform for small businesses, to create a “Buy With Apple Pay” button for its merchants.
* PYMNTS reported that the partnership, announced earlier this week on Tuesday, makes it possible for Volusion’s merchants to accept Apple Pay payments.
* With Apple Pay support, shoppers no longer need to enter their payment, shipping or contact information every time they make a purchase online. This is major news: Volusion builds e-commerce websites for over 40,000 US-based small businesses that accept orders globally.
* Kevin Sproles, CEO and founder of Volusion, said:
* In our daily conversations with the merchants we serve, we’ve learned that seamless and secure payment options are top priority, and we are happy to announce that Volusion merchants can now provide Apple Pay as an option to meet that need.
* We know merchants using Apple Pay see two to five times higher conversion at checkout compared to other payment options and see more than 50 percent faster checkout times. We are excited to be able to provide this for our merchants and their customers.
* The new button is embedded on the product pages on Volusion-powered e-commerce stores.
* The Cupertino technology giant will be testing out other partnerships with Discover, Hilton, Lowe’s and Wells Fargo, according to the report. iOS 11.3, due this Spring, will cater to small businesses with a new Business Chat feature in the Messages app.
