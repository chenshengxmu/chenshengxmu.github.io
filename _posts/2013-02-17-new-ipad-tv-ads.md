* Apple has posted two new TV ads for the iPad and iPad mini on its YouTube channel this evening. The two spots, entitled ‘Alive’ and ‘Together,’ showcase some of the 300,000+ apps made specifically for Apple’s tablet.
* The adverts themselves seem to be of a very different style than previous iPad (or iPhone, for that matter) commercials. Between app demos, several action and descriptive words are flashed across the screen. Here, watch…

* What do you think about the two new iPad spots? Effective?
