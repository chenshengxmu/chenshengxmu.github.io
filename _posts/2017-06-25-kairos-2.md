* Have you ever thought to yourself, “I wish I could schedule iMessages or text messages to send at a future date?” Well, now you don’t have to just sit and wish for such functionality anymore.
* A jailbreak tweak called Kairos 2 by iOS developer CP Digital Darkroom enables iMessage and SMS scheduling right from the stock Messages app on your jailbroken iPhone or iPad.
* Once installed, the tweak adds new features to the Messages app that you’ll notice when you launch it for the first time.
* For starters, when you tap on the Send button after composing a message, you’re presented with a new scheduling carousel wheel that lets you pick between sending the message now or choosing a future date for the message to send instead. When you choose a time, it gets stored on your device until the specified time comes along, at which point, the message is finally fired off to the recipent.
* Speaking of message storage, you’ll also notice a new Calendar-shaped button in the message thread view, which takes you to your list of scheduled messages. The list conveniently shows the date and time that the message is scheduled to go out:

* Kairos 2 supports repeating scheduled messages as well, so if you want to repeat messages for instances such as “Happy Birthday” or “Happy Holidays” on an annual basis, you can certainly do that. It even randomizes the times on repeating schedules so you don’t come off as a robot every single year.
* Kairos 2 puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking:

* Here, you get options such as:
* Being able to change the way the scheduling interface appears is handy because it can get annoying to have a two-step process to send a message right now. For that reason, I think the double-tap Send button option is a good choice.
* The Airplane Mode auto-toggling is also useful, as it automatically disables Airplane Mode when the time comes around that you have text messages scheduled to ensure they’re sent.
* Lastly, the low battery smart setting will be a godsend because when you’re run low on battery, you never really know when you’ll be able to juice back up. This function automatically sends scheduled messages when your device reaches a designated low battery percentage to ensure they’re sent before your handset dies.
* Kairos 2 is the message-scheduling solution iPhone users wish they’ve had for eons, and it’s available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $2.99. The tweak is a complete re-write from the original Kairos jailbreak tweak and is compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
