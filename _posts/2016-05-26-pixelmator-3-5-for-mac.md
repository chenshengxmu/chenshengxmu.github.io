* My favorite Photoshop alternative, Pixelmator, was updated this morning on the Mac App Store with some notable new features, bug fixes and enhancements. Pixelmator 3.5 for Mac, a free update for those who own the app, includes the new Smart Selection and Magnetic Selection tools, a new Retouch extension for Photos which provides a full set of powerful retouching tools, and more.
* The new Quick Selection tool is smart in that it lets you select even the most challenging areas with a few simple brushstrokes. You simply paint over an area you want to select and the advanced algorithm detects the object you want to select.
* The new Magnetic Selection tool lets you select objects precisely in just a few clicks. After choosing the Magnetic Selection tool in the tools palette, simply start your selection by clicking anywhere on the edge of an object you want to select.
* As you move the pointer, the tool automatically snaps around the object, making precise object selection ridiculously easy.
* First, you must enable this extension.
* Go to System Preferences → Extensions, then click Photos in the lefthand column and in the righthand column tick the box next to “Pixelmator Retouch”.
