* Apple Calendar for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and iCloud.com doesn’t just keep track of all your events and appointments in one place, but shows the birthdays for your friends and contacts as well. Here’s how to set up birthdays in the Apple Calendar app on your devices.
* Apple Calendar includes a Birthdays calendar that can display all birthdays that you have in iCloud Contacts. This special calendar also shows any birthdays for your Facebook friends and Google contacts, provided the app is set to use calendars from those accounts.

* Not only will people’s birthdays show up on your calendar, the Calendar app even tells you how old they are and notifies you about their birthday. Here’s how to set up and use Apple Calendar birthdays on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and iCloud.com.
* Apple Calendar birthdays are off by default, here’s how to turn them on.

* macOS lets you enable or disable the Birthdays calendar separately on each device.
* As the stock Calendar app is available on iOS across iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, as well as for your Mac and as a web app on iCloud.com, we’re going to cover each platform separately.
* To show or hide the Birthdays calendar on an iPhone or iPad, do the following:
* 1) Open the Apple Calendar app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* 2) Tap Calendars at the bottom of the interface.

* That’s because it takes time to synchronize your changes through iCloud to all of your devices.
* If you don’t want to know when your friends’ birthdays are coming up, disable Apple Calendar birthdays. I love seeing these notifications because I always forget people’s birthdays.
* iCloud Calendar also informs you that any changes in Contacts will be reflected in the web app within one hour. In a support document, however, Apple states that changes made in iCloud Contacts are reflected in iCloud Calendar within a day.
