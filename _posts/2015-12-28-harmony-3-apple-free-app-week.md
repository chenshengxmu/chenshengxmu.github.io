* Apple has named the puzzle game Har•mo•ny 3 from BorderLeap its new Free App of the Week in the App Store, meaning you can download the $1.99 iPhone, iPod touch and iPad game at no charge until this coming Thursday.
* Released seven months ago as a third game in the series, Har•mo•ny 3 is framed as a challenging puzzle game of “beautiful colors and captivating music, unified in perfect harmony”.
* The relaxing mind-bending sequel is basically more of the same, but better, featuring a total of 170 brand new levels. Like the previous games, Har•mo•ny 3 has you strategically rearranging subtly morphing blocks to reassemble each palette to its correct order.
* With a rapidly increasing difficulty level, the game will offer you hints after level 11 to help you get started on tough levels.
* The game packs in nearly three full hours of ambient music, including some of the most-loved music from the previous games as well as six brand new tracks featured only in the sequel.
* After solving each level, you can save its richly colored backdrop to your device to use as a wallpaper. The most recent content update has brought out 50 holiday-inspired levels complete with new effects, new music and a few other festive surprises.
* Read Lory’s review of Har.mo.ny and Har.mo.ny 2.
* The game requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 6.0 or later and is localized in English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
* Grab Har•mo•ny 3 for free in the App Store until Thursday.
