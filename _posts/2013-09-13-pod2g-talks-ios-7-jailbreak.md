* Good news on the jailbreak front this evening, as pod2g has just tweeted out that he is becoming “more and more confident about an iOS 7 public jailbreak.” He’s careful to note, however, that this doesn’t mean one is coming soon.
* Still, this is a great vote of confidence from pod2g, as there has been little said about the state of the iOS 7 jailbreak since word got out last week that the evad3rs were looking into it. Well, planetbeing provided a minor update on Wednesday…
* Here’s the tweet:
* . @pimskeks being more and more confident about an iOS 7 public jailbreak 😉 [ that does not mean soon ]

* iOS 7 has yet to receive the public jailbreak treatment, even though developer versions of the software have been floating around for nearly three months. Last year there was a tethered iOS 6 jailbreak available throughout its beta process.
* But nevertheless, it’s good to know the evad3rs are on it. The team—which is made up of pod2g, MuscleNerd, planetbeing and pimskeks—was responsible for the public iOS 6 jailbreak, which was responsible for hacking over 20 million devices.
