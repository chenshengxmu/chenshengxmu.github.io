* Eddy Cue is on stage right now, at Apple’s WWDC keynote, talking about the new Maps app in iOS 10. The stock mapping application gets a lot smarter in the upcoming update, with improved search, en route traffic information and a new feature called Quick Controls.
* “We’re making Maps do more for you in advance,” says Eddy Cue. The new Maps app can proactively deliver directions to where you most likely want to go next, based on your routine or appointments on your calendar. Once a route is planned, Maps can search along the route for gas stations, restaurants, coffee shops and more and provides an estimate of how the stop impacts the length of your trip.
* En route traffic conditions info gives you a heads up of any kind of gridlock up ahead. In turn-by-turn Navigation mode, you can pinch to zoom out on your device’s display, to see traffic conditions down the road from you.

* The Quick Controls feature is nice, as it gives you quick access to controls while in Navigation mode. Note in the screenshot above, these shortcuts include points of interest like gas stations, food and coffee places, and app settings like overview, details and audio. The buttons and text are big to make them easy to use while you are en route.

* Finally, Apple has opened up iOS 10 Maps to developers with new extensions. This means apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps, and services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.
