* As it promised a few weeks ago, Facebook today has released a major iOS SDK update for developers. SDK 3.0 Beta is chock-full of features that will enable iOS developers to start taking advantage of Apple’s newfound relationship with the social network.
* During its WWDC keynote last month, Apple announced system-level Facebook integration into both Mac OS X and iOS 6. Not only does this give users an additional outlet to share content, but it also means there will soon be no more need for OAuth…
* What’s OAuth, you ask? It’s when an app asks you to authenticate yourself through Facebook, forcing you into the Facebook app or some poorly-designed website. In iOS 6, however, Facebook login credentials will be available system-wide.
* But perhaps the most exciting thing about SDK 3.0 for iOS, as MG Siegler points out, is the fact that there’s not a lot of talk about HTML5. It’s all “Native” and “Objective-C,” reiterating earlier reports that Facebook’s app is going to be getting a much-needed makeover.
* Obviously, this SDK is still in Beta, as is iOS 6. But come this fall, we imagine we’ll be seeing an onslaught of Facebook-dependent applications.
