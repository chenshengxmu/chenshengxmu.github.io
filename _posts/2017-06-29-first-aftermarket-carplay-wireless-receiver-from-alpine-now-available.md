* The car audio and navigation systems company Alpine today announced that its first aftermarket CarPlay wireless receiver, dubbed iLX-107, is now available for purchase in the United States, priced a bit on the high side at $900 a pop.
* “The award-winning iLX-107 wireless Apple CarPlay system offers even more convenience in accessing Maps, Phone, Messages and Music from the iPhone in-vehicle without ever needing to connect a cable,” the company notes.
* The unit packs a seven-inch VGA revolution capacitive touchscreen in a mech-less body. It integrates with rear view camera systems and your car’s steering wheel controls.
* The conveniently located Volume, Track, Home and Siri hard keys are accessible for quick access and simple control.
* Alpine was one of the first firms to offer aftermarket CarPlay receivers for owners of older vehicles than lack CarPlay integration. However, today’s new is significant as the iLX-107 represents their first aftermarket CarPlay receiver that supports wireless connections.
* This lets you use CarPlay with your iLX-107 without needing to connect an iPhone via a USB cable. To set it up, you just pair your wireless Apple CarPlay unit from your iPhone. Of course, wired connectivity via the standard Lightning cable is supported, too.
* Connecting an iPhone to your iLX-107 via a Lightning cable for the first time automatically sets up wireless connectivity, which is great. The accessory uses the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band to optimize wireless connectivity performance, Alpine has said.
* While Alpine does not sell the new receiver directly, you can purchase it from a network of authorized dealers who won’t just sell you the accessory but install it for you as well.
* Check out Alpine’s store locator online tool to find a dealer nearest to your location.
* Wireless CarPlay requires iOS 8.3 or later.
