* Most publications are agreeing on most of the specs for the upcoming iPad 3. The consensus seems to be that the iPad 3 will feature a Retina display, larger battery, upgraded cameras, iOS 5.1 w/ Siri support, and LTE. However, the main question lingering is if the iPad 3 will feature the rumored upgraded dual-core A5X processor or quad-core A6 processor.
* AllThingsD has published a report on the latest out of analyst Steve Mullane. Mullane says he’s been hearing from supply chains that the iPad 3 will feature the dual-core A5X processor…
* BlueFin Research Partners analyst Steve Mullane says information coming out of the semiconductor supply chain suggests that Samsung, Apple’s chip fab partner, isn’t equipped to manufacture 28-nanometer quad-core chips, as the A6 is presumed to be….we believe the 32-nanometer ramp validates the recent rumors that the iPad 3 will likely use a higher speed, die-shrink version of the A5 dual-core processor, named the A5X processor, as opposed to the next-generation A6 quad-core processor.”
* Mullane’s findings back up earlier claims that the iPad 3 will feature an A5X processor. However, 9to5mac’s Mark Gurman reported over the weekend that Apple is currently working on both the A6 processor and A5X processor. One possible scenario the report gives, is the A6 processor being featured in the iPad 3, while the A5X will be featured in the rumored Apple TV that’s set to launch in March.
* At this point, it’s hard to tell.
* Apple is rumored to announce the iPad 3, at an event hosted in California, during the first week of March. US retailers have already slashed the priced of the iPad 2 and have begun removing the iPad 2 from their shelves, welcoming the arrival of the iPad 3. The iPad 3 has also reportedly begun shipping from China.
* We want to hear from you guys. Do you think the iPad 3 will feature an A5X processor or A6 processor?
