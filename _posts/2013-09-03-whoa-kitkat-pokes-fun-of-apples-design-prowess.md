* You’ve likely learned by now about this morning’s surprise Google announcement, clearly conceived as a novel way of busting up Apple’s news and diverting attention from the brightening of your day.
* I’m talking about the upcoming Android version 4.4, code-named KitKat after the famous chocolate-covered wafer biscuit which has apparently “been a favorite candy” on the Android team.
* The though process behind the delicious partnership has now unravelled itself in a cringeworthy KitKat clip.
* Not only does it spoof Apple’s elaborate product videos, it does so by ridiculing the way Jony Ive and his industrial design team go about agonizing over the minutiae. Wait, a confectionery maker is parodying Apple’s presentation mojo? What has this world come to?
* The video, available on KitKat’s YouTube channel resembles the overall style and shininess of Apple’s promotional clips.
* “Every corner, every edge, every finger of every bar has been carefully considered and crafted to create a beautifully immersive and multi-sensory experience,” the video says in an attempt to derail Apple’s design process.
* Meet Chris Catlin, KitKat’s Chief Breaks Officer.
* My favorite line: “And it really does taste as good as it looks”.
* I also happen to like their take on Apple’s ‘there’s an app for that’ campaign.
* I think it’s funny, though die-hard fans may find it the dumbest thing they’ve seen in a while. At any rate, it’s a novel PR ploy, you have to give them that – Google and Android are in the headlines today.
* Don’t forget that KitKat is hugely popular so you’ll soon start seeing that Android-themed product packaging cropping up at your nearest department store.

* According to a media release by KitKat’s parent Nestlé, they will distribute more than 50 million specially branded KitKat bars in nineteen countries, including Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Dubai, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
* A small number of Android robot-shaped KitKat bars will be offered as prizes (below).

* I’m expecting some innovative television advertising around this cross-promotion.
* The tie-up is such that neither party paid each other, BBC News has learned. Nestlé isn’t exactly stranger to digital marketing: earlier in the year, the company bought its first-ever piece of online content property, the U.S. website Petfinder which helps prospective adopters with adoptable pets.
* Expect more KitKat cross-promotion as Android 4.4 gets closer to prime time.
* For now, there’s now a link at the bottom of Google’s Android 4.4 web page which takes you to the official KitKat homepage where they’re currently running a promotion for the chance to win a free Nexus 7 2013 or Google Play Store credit.
* For those wondering, here are Google’s sweet Android code-names:
* • Android 1.5, Cupcake • Android 1.6, Donut • Android 2.0, Eclair • Android 2.2, Froyo • Android 2.3, Gingerbread • Android 3.0, Honeycomb • Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich • Android 4.1, Jelly Bean • Android 4.4, KitKat
* About that promo: was it funny or did it come across as crossing the line?
