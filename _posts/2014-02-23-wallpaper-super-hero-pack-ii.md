* In response to the feminine pink wallpaper from several weeks ago, the Wallpapers of the Week section turned in a masculine direction. It is known to us, a majority of the readership is male, but who knew a pink wallpaper would upset so many readers.
* In an effort to, well, make up for my mistake, I turned to hyper masculine super heroes. Last week I featured a small pack of hero wallpapers to much reader satisfaction. As promised, if the first pack was a big hit, this is the follow up. We listen to our readers and encourage you to keep the feedback comingâ€¦
* Super heroes bring out excitement in everyone. Although the interest typically begins when we were children, heroes are timeless and ageless. As we get older they become even more nostalgic and bring back great memories. Below is a collection of parallax ready wallpapers for your iPads and iPhones to help kindle your childhood memories.

* Tap the corresponding device link below the image you would like to save. Once the full resolution image loads, tap hold, and save to Camera Roll. Once saved, head to Photos.app or Settings.app, either of which will allow you to set the picture as wallpaper. Alternately, save the image on your desktop computer to the iTunes sync folder.
* As always, readers are encouraged to submit wallpapers for the section. The images no longer need to be original works of digital art or photograph. Any wallpaper you think is a great option, send it my way. The easiest ways to catch me digitally are via Twitter @jim_gresham or embed the image in an email to jim@idownloadblog.com.
