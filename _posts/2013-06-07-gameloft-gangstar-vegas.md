* Your wild trip through Las Vegas starts today: French games maker Gameloft has just released the latest Grand Theft-inspired open world action game on the App Store. Gangstar Vegas has you rolling up on a new trip through the City of Sin, the outrageous Las Vegas.
* There are 80 missions in the initial release and maps are nine times the size of previous Gangstars. You can play either in a story mode, with challenges like races, fights, carnage missions and breaking the bank in casino games. Oh, and you get to play as a mixed martial arts fighter…
* But wait, there’s more!
* Ganstar Vegas makes use of the Havok physics engine which takes care of the realistic ragdoll effects during fights and stunts.
* And as you could imagine, the game comes packed to the gills with a bunch of weapons like like Molotov cocktails, flamethrowers and an electric guitar (!).

* And don’t worry, you’ll be able to sit behind the steering wheel of all sorts of crazy vehicles such as monster trucks, muscle cars and fighter jets, to name just a few.

* Here’s a nice launch trailer.
* The game allows for character customizations that include both appearance and skill upgrades.
* The massive 1.4GB download costs seven bucks and runs natively on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. For the impatient types, an additional $2 in-app purchase buys you a Puny Cash Bundle to spend on those upgrades.
* The app is “coming very soon” to Android devices.
* To learn more, visit the official Gangstar Vegas web site.
* Gameloft has several titles in the Grand Theft Auto series on the App Store.
* Most notably, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City hit the App Store last December and Grand Theft Auto 3: The 10 Year Anniversary Edition has just been updated with cloud saves, iPhone 5 support and custom iTunes playlists.
