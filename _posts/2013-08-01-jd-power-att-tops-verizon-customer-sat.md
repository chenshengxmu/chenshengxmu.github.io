* Although AT&T was the first U.S. carrier that sold the iPhone when Apple introduced the smartphone in 2007, Verizon Wireless quickly overshadowed the telecom giant. For the first time, AT&T has stolen the spotlight back, outranking rival Verizon in customer service satisfaction.
* No, hell did not freeze over. And, yes, this is the AT&T that late last year was voted having the worst voice and data service, had all the tethering issues and is constantly sniping with about everyone…
* Still, the carrier scored the highest of the last three previous J.D. Power’s customer service surveys, according to new data. The research firm found AT&T scored 795 out of a possible 1,000. Verizon, which used to be the customer satisfaction champion, slipped to No. 2 with 790 points.
* Both Sprint and T-Mobile ranked below 786 average for contract carriers.
* After weeks of declaring itself better than Verizon for speed and reliability, AT&T Thursday touted its efforts to boost the wireless experience.
* Along with scoring high for its retail service, “AT&T also scored the highest in the industry for its online experience, which had the biggest improvement over hte past six months,” the carrier wrote in a media release.

* AT&T pointed to its 24/7 online service, the ability to schedule store appointments online, as well as increasing the number of AT&T chat representatives. That last item seems to be increasingly important when it comes to determining carrier customer satisfaction.
* “J.D. Power found that customers are increasingly contacting their carriers online, versus over the phone or in the store, when they have a service issue,” GigaOM noted.

* That point was driven home recently when I had to endure multiple sales pitches while picking up an iPhone at the local  Verizon store.
* Here’s a video AT&T put together to promote its new store design and customer experience.
* Of course, this ranking by AT&T is unlikely to last.
* Then again, we may be seeing a turning point where a carrier’s retail location – and all the effort poured into sumptuous surroundings – are less important to customers. So much of brick-and-mortar retail now is to showcase products, not sell them.
* Isn’t it time smartphone carriers of all people understood that, as well?
