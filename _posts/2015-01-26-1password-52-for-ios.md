* 1Password, the popular password-manager application for iOS and OS X, has just received a nice refresh in the App Store and Mac App Store, respectively.
* Available as a freemium download, 1Password 5.2 brings out a new Login Creator feature available to all users, a one-time Password tool for Pro users, a bunch of syncing improvements and several other enhancements that improve your experience.
* Login Creator, which you can see in action right below, is a new tool for adding existing logins to 1Password to “get a feel for how much time it can save you.” It streamlines the process for hundreds of popular sites and services, developer AgileBits noted.

* The new One-Time Password tool for Pro users is designed to work with online accounts protected with two-factor authentication, such as Amazon, Tumblr and many more. After adding an account, the feature will generate a one-time two-factor authentication code to verify your identity.

* This is actually pretty useful because no longer do you have to switch between 1Password and a third-party authenticator like Authy and Google Authenticator to generate your temporary codes.
* Other additions available to Pro users: the ability to delete attachments from the item editor, adding new custom field types like addresses, dates, month/year and more.
* Last but not least, 1Password’s extension has seen improvements in terms of functionality, design, syncing, accessibility and localization.
* The full changelog is too long to include here, but you can check it out over at the AgileBits website. The Mac edition of 1Password has been refreshed, too.
* The list of enhancements in the Mac version, among other items, includes the ability to sync secondary vaults to iOS via Wi-Fi Sync, exclude secondary vaults from syncing at all, syncing of Master Password changes across devices using iCloud sync and much more.
* Download 1Password free in the App Store.
* The Mac edition will set you back $50 a pop.
