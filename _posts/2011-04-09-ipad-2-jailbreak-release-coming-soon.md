* If you have jailbroken your iDevice before, you should recognize the name Chronic Dev. Much like the notorious iPhone Dev Team, Chronic Dev plays a large part in the jailbreaking community.
* Their software, GreenPois0n, made jailbreaking as easy as plugging in your device to a computer.
* Although they’ve been relatively quiet lately, it appears they plan to come back in a big way. Chronic Dev team member Joshua Hill, aka @p0sixninja, mentioned on Twitter yesterday that his team was focused on finishing their iPad 2 jailbreak.
* Since a jailbreaking solution has yet to become available for the iPad 2, this is pretty big news. The 4.3.1 exploit released last Sunday by the Dev Team does not work on Apple’s latest tablet, and there has been no word from Comex on his current progress.
* When will the iPad 2 jailbreak be finished? @p0sixninja tells a Twitter follower that they are in early stages, and jokes that progress depends on which way the winds blowing. Since he uses the word “finishing” in his early Tweet, I have to assume he was just kidding.
* Tech site Redmond Pie believes the iPad 2 jailbreak will be packaged in with the new version of GreenPois0n, which is expected to be released soon and work on all iDevices.
* Keep checking back and we will keep you updated on the latest iPad 2 jailbreak news.
* Anyone dying to jailbreak their iPad 2?
