* Following iFixIt’s ritual teardown of Apple’s new iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c and a detailed chip analysis of the former by Chipworks, research firm IHS Suppli ran their spreadsheets to guesstimate just how much Apple may be paying for the parts.
* According to a research note, the pricier top-of-the-line iPhone 5s commands a bill of material of $199.
* Its polycarbonate plastic brother costs less to build, with part costs pegged at $173. The full breakdown is right after the break…
* AllThingsD has managed to get hold of the IHS iSuppli report a day early.
* The crux:
* According the findings of an IHS report coming tomorrow (but shared with AllThingsD today), Apple spends at least $191 on components to build a 16-gigabyte iPhone 5S.
* The cost rises to $210 for a 64 GB unit. The cost of assembly adds another $8 per unit, bringing the range to between $199 and $218.
* These costs only cover parts and assembly and exclude manufacturing, distribution, advertising, packaging, research and development, royalties and licenses and so forth.
* As you know, Apple sells the unsubsidized iPhone 5s for $649 to $849, depending on storage capacity. The off-contract iPhone 5c is a $549/$649 value for 16/32GB model. Despite charging an extra $200 for a 16-to-64GB storage bump, in reality the extra flash storage sets Apple back just $19.
* The iPhone’s four-inch Retina display assembly costs a whopping $41 in parts.
* Other cost-saving measures, according to iSuppli:
* Apple seems to be spending a lot of time and money combining RF chips. Where other phone companies would be using whatever chips its various vendors sell off-the-shelf, Apple seems to be pushing its RF suppliers to do things they don’t do for anyone else.
* The iPhone’s wireless internals are sourced from a number of companies, including Qualcomm, Skyworks, Avago, RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor.
* The iPhone 5 supported no more than five LTE bands. The 5s and 5c can support as many as 13, and that’s unique. Unlike other phones designers, Apple has spent a lot of time collaborating with the RF chip companies to find novel solutions that its competitors don’t have.
* iSuppli notes that both new iPhones use the same unique combination of RF chips at a combined cost of $32. By the way, iSuppli’s estimates are for the entry-level 16GB iPhone 5s/5c models.
* iSuppli last year estimated each 16GB iPhone 5 cost $199 to build.

* The $26 difference between last year’s iPhone 5 and this year’s iPhone 5c stems from Apple’s unmatched economies of scale: it’s had a full year to learn how to build the iPhone 5 and is now now able to keep costs at a minimum by perusing the iPhone 5’s components for the iPhone 5c.
* It also blows my mind that sophisticated parts for the top-line iPhone 5s cost just $26 more. Keep in mind that this estimated difference covers the cost of the new 64-bit A7 chip, the M7 motion coprocessor, upgraded camera hardware, dual LED-flash, Touch ID fingerprint sensor and more.
* Speaking of which, iSuppli pegged a Touch ID cost at just seven bucks. The fingerprint sensor is likely built by AuthenTec engineers that Apple acquired last year. As for the Apple-designed, Samsung-built A7 chip, it costs an estimated $19, a $6 premium over last year’s A6 found inside the iPhone 5c.
* Oh, and just as we suspected, the A7 chip has a faster LPDDR3 RAM versus the 1GB LPDDR2 in the A6 package (these memory chips are supplied by SK Hynix, Elpida and Samsung).
