* HomeSpringPage is a new jailbreak tweak that will allow you to add an empty first page to your Home screen. This is great, because it allows you to have dedicated real estate for adding Dashboard X widgets.
* If you’re a Dashboard X user, HomeSpringPage is a natural fit to accomodate your needs for space. Take a look at our full video walkthrough inside for the proof…
* There are no options or settings to configure with HomeSpringPage. After installation, you’ll notice a new first page on your Springboard that’s completely devoid of any app icons.
* You can still add app icons to the first page if you choose to do so, but I see it as more of a dedicated space for your favorite widgets.
* HomeSpringPage is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. There’s a lot that you can do with a blank Home screen page, so tell us, how would you go about using this tweak?
