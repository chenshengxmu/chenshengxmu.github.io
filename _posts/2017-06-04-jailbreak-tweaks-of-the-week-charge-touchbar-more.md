* After installation, you get a fully-customizable battery charging interface any time your device is locked and plugged into a power source. Complete with a beautiful background blur and a simplistic interface, it’s perfect for minimalists that are looking for a simpler UI.
* You can customize what kinds of information appear alongside the battery information, as well as the colors of the indicator.

* TouchBar is a sleek new jailbreak tweak that attempts to replicate the Touch Bar experience from the 2016 MacBook Pro on jailbroken iOS devices.

* You can choose the main page the TouchBar tweak and configure where it does and doesn’t appear in iOS.
