* It’s been a long wait, but it’s finally here. Real Racing 3 has officially landed in the US App Store as a free download. A couple of weeks ago, we spent some hands-on time with the game, and came away blown away by the graphics. Some of you guys might not dig the game’s new freemium approach — an approach that ditches paying up front in favor of paying for in app purchases — but only time will tell if this negatively impacts the game’s reception.
* Real Racing 3 features tons of new cars, tracks, and all sorts of upgrades for your vehicle of choice. It’s a polarizing title due to the fact that iOS’ most popular racing game franchise has taken an abrupt turn towards the freemium model. But even if you don’t appreciate the new approach, you owe it to yourself to download this game just to take in the visuals. Real Racing 3 is eye candy in its most concentrated form.
* Head over to the App Store now to download Real Racing 3. The app is universal, working both on the iPad and the iPhone. Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments below, and be sure to check out our video hands-on.
