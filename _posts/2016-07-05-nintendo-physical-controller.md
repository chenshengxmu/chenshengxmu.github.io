* Nintendo plans to push further into development for smart devices, and is exploring the idea of hardware, the company said during its annual shareholders meeting. Polygon passes along comments made by Nintendo’s GM of entertainment planning and development during the meeting, in which he said the game-maker is considering building physical controllers for smartphones and tablets.
* One of the biggest takeaways from Nintendo’s annual general shareholders meeting was its decision to dedicate a large portion of its efforts on developing new software for smart devices, like smartphones and tablets. Takahashi is leading the smart device development team at the company, and said Nintendo is looking into both hardware and software development for different types of games and experiences. 
* “Physical controllers for smart device applications are available in the market and it is possible that we may also develop something new by ourselves,” Takahashi said. “I believe Nintendo’s way of thinking is to look at whether action games are really not impossible (without a physical controller for smart device applications) to create and how we can make it happen to create such a game.”
* Industry watchers have long called for Nintendo, who has been struggling to sell consoles in recent years, to focus more resources on mobile titles. The company initially rebuffed the thought, but is obviously beginning to warm up to the idea. Earlier this year, it released its first game on iOS called Miitomo, and it has other titles coming this fall from its Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem franchises.
