* When you’re half awake, tapping the tiny “tap to snooze” button on the Lock screen can be a daunting chore. Fortunately, if you’re a jailbreaker, it’s much easier to snooze an overzealous alarm
* By turning your Lock screen into one giant button, SnoozeHelper (free) makes it super easy to snooze a pesky alarm clock. Watch our video walkthrough inside to see what I mean.
* Once you install SnoozeHelper, there are no options to setup or configure. Once your alarm goes off, simply tap anywhere on the screen (outside of the clock) to silence your alarm temporarily.
* Again, SnoozeHelper is a free jailbreak tweak available for download right now on the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think about SnoozeHelper? Do you think it would make your mornings a bit easier to deal with? Drop us a line down below with your thoughts on the matter.
