* Something I like about the iPhone and just about any Apple product is their simplicity. You can just pick up any of their device, and without much technical knowledge, you’re usually able to figure things out pretty quickly – my mom is the living proof of this.
* Simplicity usually comes with trade offs though, and the iPhone is no different. For example, have you ever tried to precisely resize an image on your iPhone? While you can crop the image, effectively reducing its size, you can’t change the resolution of a picture to a specific size.
* This is where third-party apps come into play. There are many apps out there that will let you change the size of a photo on your iPhone so I’m not saying the one I used in this post is the one and only, but it’s one that I’ve found to work particularly well.
* In this post, I will show you how to resize a picture on your iPhone using Image Resizer+, no computer needed!
* UPDATE: we have published another tutorial showing how to batch resize iPhone photos and videos. Because it is a newer application, we definitely suggest checking it out as it might perform better than Image Resizer+, which hasn’t been updated in a while.
* Step 1: Download Image Resizer+ from the App Store (other options are provided below, but Image Resizer+ is my favorite)

* Step 2: Launch the app, and tap on the “Photos” option. It will bring up all the albums on your device, including Camera Roll and My Photo Stream (as you can tell from the above screenshot, you can also load an image directly from your Dropbox). Select the album and then pick the photo you want to resize.
* Step 3: Once the image has been loaded into the app, slide to the right in order to bring up the resizing options. At this point, you will have the option to resize the picture in percent or in pixels.

* Adjust the resolution in percent (left screenshot above): If you want to resize in percent, just use the slider to reduce the image size to your liking. You will notice that as you slide to increase or decrease the size, the width and height of the image will be adjusted automatically.
* Adjust the resolution in pixels (right screenshot above): If you want to get exact control over the size of the picture, you can choose to resize in pixels. This will let you type in the exact width or height you want your image to be resized to.
* Note that by default, the app is set to resize the image proportionally, but you have the option to make it unproportional, as you can see on the screenshot above.
* Step 4: Once you’re done resizing your image to your liking, hit the “Resize” button. As you can tell from the screenshot below, not only the picture has been shrunk to a smaller size, but the file size has also dropped from 8.7 MB to 3.2 MB, while keeping the same aspect ratio.

* Step 5: Once the image has been resized, hit the Share button and select what you want to do with it. You can of course save it to your Camera Roll, but you can also share it to various services including Twitter, Facebook, etc.

* It’s as simple as that. Of course, as I mentioned above, there are many different applications that can allow you to change the size of a photo on your iPhone, so here are a few other options:
