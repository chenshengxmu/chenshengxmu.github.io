* For those who haven’t heard the news yet, the iPhone isn’t just a popular smart phone, it’s also a popular camera. In fact, studies show that Apple’s smartphone is among the most-used point and shoot cameras in the world.
* If you too love your iPhone camera, but find yourself missing your old 32mm, Cydia has a tweak for you. Stampr gives your iPhone photos a touch of nostalgia by adding the time and date stamp to the bottom of each snapshot…
* Not only does it allow you to keep track of when you took the photos, you can even add custom text. There a few options that make this more than just a time and date stamper for your iPhone.

* Just install Stampr from Cydia and pop into your Settings app. Here you’ll find cool customization options like changing the color and size of the text that shows up on your photograph.
* While it may not be for everyone, this tweak could really come in handy for a couple with a newborn (cough, Sebastien) that might take daily photographs with their iPhone. Stampr is a free download and available in the default BigBoss repo in Cydia.
* Have you used Stampr?
