* Good news this afternoon for Real Racing fans. Electronic Arts has released the massive ‘Dubai’ update we told you about earlier this week, and it is now available in the App Store. The update features everything you’d expect from a franchise racer, including new car-makers, new car models, and new tracks…
* Here are the release notes from EA (version 1.1.2):
* Real Racing goes to the Middle East! Race around the challenging Dubai Autodrome at twilight in a brand new range of Lexus and Dodge cars.
* • New Track – Dubai Autodrome: 6 track layouts with day and twilight racing • New Manufacturer – Lexus • New Cars – Lexus IS-F, Lexus LFA, Dodge Charger RT, Dodge Charger SRT8 • 50+ new events
* And here’s the official trailer for today’s Dubai update:
* Real Racing has long been considered the gold standard for mobile racing games, thanks to its superior graphics, host of car (thanks to extensive licensing agreements) and track choices, and in-depth gameplay. And it almost seems to have gotten more popular since it went ‘freemium’ in version 3—which is hard to do.
* Anyway, enough talking, get downloading! You can find the latest version of Real Racing 3 in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
* Have you tried the Dubai update yet? Thoughts?
