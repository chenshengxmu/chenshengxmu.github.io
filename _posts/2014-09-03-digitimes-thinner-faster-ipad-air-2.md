* According to DigiTimes, a hit-and-miss Taiwanese trade publication, Apple’s suppliers are ramping up production of components for a second-generation iPad Air, which sources describe as being thinner, faster and incorporating the widely expected Touch ID fingerprint scanning feature.
* The report Tuesday doesn’t shed more light on the matter beyond stating the obvious, that the device will run the upcoming A8 processor and be thinner than the current-generation iPad Air, which itself is 7.5mm (about 0.29 inch) thick.
* DigiTimes writes that touch panel makers TPK, GIS and other suppliers have now received orders for full-lamination units. Even though the iPad Air 2 should remain unchanged in terms of size and resolution, sources that spoke to DigiTimes expect a “thinner” device equipped with “an enhanced processor” and sporting ”improved fingerprint recognition” features.
* As the current iPad Air lacks fingerprint scanning, the ”improved fingerprint recognition” likely refers to a second-generation Touch ID that’s expected to make its debut on the iPhone 6 at the September 9 event.
* The report also adds that Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display are seeing orders increase for the iPhone 6 screens. Should Apple stick to its release schedule, expect the next-generation iPad lineup to be unveiled at a separate media event in October.
* In addition to the aforementioned features, the iPad Air 2 should incorporate a new anti-reflective coating making the screen easier to read, subtle design changes and 2GB of RAM to power the rumored split-screen multitasking.
* A 12.9-inch ‘iPad Pro’ model is said to be in tow for an early-2015 introduction, according to the rumor-mill and big media like Bloomberg.
