* Apple has seeded the first OS X 10.9.2 beta to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The release comes just three days after the public version of OS X 10.9.1 hit the Mac App Store.
* The new build is available to registered developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what specific changes are coming in the update, or when it’ll be available. But Apple asks developers to focus on Mail, Messages, VPN, Graphics Drivers and VoiceOver.
* Update: as noted by 9to5Mac, OS X 10.9.2 includes support for FaceTime Audio and it is now integrated into both Messages and FaceTime apps.
