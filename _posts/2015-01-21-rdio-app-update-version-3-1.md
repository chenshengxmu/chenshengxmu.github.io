* Popular streaming music service Rdio posted an update for its iOS client today, bringing the app to version 3.1. The update brings about a new station for hot, just-released music, enhanced sharing capabilities and various other new features and improvements.
* The New Music Weekly Station is a handpicked selection of the week’s hottest tracks from Rdio’s New Releases section. And as for the enhanced sharing, users can now quickly share music with a press-and-hold while listening to any track, album, playlist or station.
* Rdio also made some changes to its website today regarding favorites, which should trickle down to its other apps. Users can now multi-select favorite tracks, sort their favorite tracks by most-played, build a playlist from their favorites, and explore their friends’ favorites.
* Like other music services, it’s clear Rdio is working to improve the music discovery experience—a goal that could lead to more users, more plays, and of course more money. You can find the latest version of Rdio’s app for both iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free.
