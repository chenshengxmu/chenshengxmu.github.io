* In Apple’s Q1 earnings call, the company released very impressive numbers for its sales in the first three months of 2011. The iPhone’s fastest growing market is China, with an over 250% increase in iPhone sales since this time last year.
* China is a major hub for technology and smartphone innovation, and most iPhone knockoffs are Chinese-made. 10% of Apple’s revenue comes from China (to the tune of about $5 billion). The iPhone is doing extremely well; now accounting for 8.3% of China’s 850 million mobile customers.
* Macworld reports,
* “It’s unclear, however, where in China the device is selling the most. Cook’s reference to Greater China includes the mainland, Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan, said Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu.
* But analysts have said that in mainland China, Apple is seeing a major shift with how consumers are viewing the iconic smartphone. When Apple’s iPhone 4 launched there in late September, it was a hit with Chinese consumers, quickly selling out and leading to shortages.”
* The iPhone is seen as a status symbol in China (as it is in the U.S.), and the wide range of fake iPhones available point to the device’s influence on the Chinese culture.
* China didn’t get the iPhone until 2009, and Apple originally had to sell the smartphone without Wi-Fi to comply with Chinese regulations. The iPhone 4 was able to be sold with Wi-Fi capability, and the iPhone has gained a 2.8% increase in market share since its release. That may not sound too significant, but when you take into account 850 million customers, the numbers are rather impressive.
* Macworld shares some insight from the managing director for a Beijing-based research firm,
* “The iPhone 4’s appealing features and user interface have made it an attractive smartphone for buyers in China, Natkin said. Furthermore, the device is a status symbol in China, he added.
* “If you look at the Apple experience store in Beijing, it’s packed everyday,” he said. “People have a very high regard for the Apple brand and for its ability to innovate.”
* Apple is definitely happy that the iPhone is doing well in China, but they’re probably not too happy about the vibrant black market that exists for knockoff devices.
* What do you think? If you live in China, let us know how you see the iPhone’s influence in your community.
