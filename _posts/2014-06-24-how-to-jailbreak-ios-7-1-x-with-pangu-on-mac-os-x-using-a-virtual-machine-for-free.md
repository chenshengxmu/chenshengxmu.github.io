* So it’s kind of a bummer that there isn’t a Mac version of Pangu just yet. This is especially true for those of us who only have Macs and don’t own any Windows machines (raises hand).
* But just because Pangu is only available for Windows doesn’t mean that you’re dead in the water. There is an easy, if not a teeny bit time consuming, way to jailbreak iOS 7.1.x on a Mac right now. It can be accomplished by means of using a virtual Windows instance.
* Check inside to see how you Mac users can jailbreak your iOS 7.1.x devices with Pangu using a Windows virtual machine instance. It’s probably a lot easier than you imagined, and most importantly, it’s absolutely free!
* Step 1: Download and install Parallels Desktop 9. Parallels offers a free 14-day trial, which is plenty of time to jailbreak iOS 7.1.1 with Pangu.
* Step 2: Download the Windows 8.1 Enterprise evaluation. Microsoft offers a free 90-day trial for Windows 8.1.
* Step 3: Install Windows 8.1 using Parallels Desktop 9. The install process is extremely straightforward. After you download Windows 8.1, launch Parallels, go to File > New > and click Install Windows from DVD or Image File. Point to the Window .ISO file you downloaded, and the install process should begin.
* Step 4: Once you are running Windows 8.1 instance on Parallels, install iTunes for Windows.
* Step 5: After iTunes is installed, follow our Pangu jailbreak tutorial to jailbreak your iDevice running iOS 7.1.x!
* For the record, this is the exact thing that I did when recording our Pangu jailbreak tutorial. It may be a bit time consuming to download and install Windows, but after that, it’s pretty much smooth sailing from there. I’d say that in less than an hour you can have a fully jailbroken iOS device, even if you don’t have a “real” Windows machine.
* What do you think? Have you used a virtual machine to jailbreak using Pangu on a Mac? Sound off down below in the comments section.
* Update: An official version of Pangu has now been released for Mac OS X. We’ve created a walkthrough video and tutorial for jailbreaking iOS 7.1.x on a Mac.
