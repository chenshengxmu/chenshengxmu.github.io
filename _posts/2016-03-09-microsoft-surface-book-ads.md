* Microsoft is back at it with new commercials that build up to the “I can’t do that on my Mac” tagline.
* The Windows giant kicked off the new theme with commercials for Windows 10 that highlight some of the things “Macs can’t do” such as its built-in Cortana personal digital assistant, support for inking and drawing on notebooks with built-in touchscreens and the ability to log in to Windows with your face.
* Yesterday, Satya Nadella & Co. posted new commercials for its Surface Book, a device marketed as “the ultimate laptop” because it’s performant and versatile. The commercials, first spotted by The Loop, gush over Surface Book features such as a high-resolution screen and the responsiveness and precision of its stylus.
* The ads feature wildlife photographer Tim Flach, a first-time Surface Book user who’s made his animal portraits look almost human using the device and Microsoft’s stylus.

* And two more ads, these ones detailing the Microsoft stylus with 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity and the Surface Book’s high quality 3,000-by-2,000 pixel resolution screen. Both ads close with a ”I just can’t do that on my Mac” tagline.

* “No matter what you’re creating, do it better on Surface Book,” reads the description. “With the power to run the software you need in an incredibly light body, plus a Pen and beautiful touchscreen, Surface Book is revolutionizing the way you work.”
* As observed by The Loop, Microsoft’s ads also use a version of “Song” by Kidstreet which Apple used in its 2012 commercial for the Retina MacBook Pro.

* Now, the Surface Book is definitely an interesting machine, but it’s also very pricey. At $1,899 for the mid-range model with half the GPU memory and a Core i5 dual core processor, it’s no match for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with its high-quality Intel series i7 quad core processor and two gigabytes of video RAM.
* The flagship Surface Book model with 1 TB of flash storage and a Core i7 processor is $3,200, by the way. It is true, however, that the Retina screen on Mac notebooks does not quite match up the Surface Book’s high-resolution display.
* Besides, I think the real competitor to the Surface Book here is the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. So, what’s your opinion about Microsoft’s new ads?
