* Apple has debuted an interesting new mini-film on its YouTube channel dedicated to its $349 HomePod wireless speaker, directed by Spike Jonze. Aptly titled “Welcome Home”, the four-minute video also stars musician and dancer FKA Twigs.
* The ad is set to Anderson Paak’s new song “Til It’s Over” and shows a lively dance number from Twigs after she gets home from a rough day and asks HomePod to “play something I love.”
* Adweek praised the mini-film:
* Spike Jonze has directed a new four-minute short film for Apple’s HomePod speaker featuring yet another marquee collaborator—the English musician and dancer FKA twigs.
* The result is a stunning piece that’s charming, surreal, emotional, playful, theatrical and utterly compelling—one of the most remarkable ads of the year so far.
* The publication learned that a shorter 60-second edit will air during primetime network TV.
* What do you think of the HomePod mini-film?
