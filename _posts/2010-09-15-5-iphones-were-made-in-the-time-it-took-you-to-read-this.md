* Yes, by the time you finished reading the title of this post, Foxconn produced about 5 iPhones. Now I let you imagine how many iPhones are made in the time it’s going to take you to read the rest of this post.
* Last week we shared with you an article about where the iPhone is made, in which the CEO of Foxconn said his company makes 137,000 iPhones per day. If you do the math, that’s almost 1.6 iPhone per second…
* I don’t know about you but I think that is an incredible number. Now if only Apple could make 1.6 white iPhone per second, that wouldn’t be too bad either.
* What says you?
