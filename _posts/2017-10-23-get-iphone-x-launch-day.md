* The big day is coming soon! On October 27th, Apple will open up pre-orders for iPhone X, and on November 3rd, the device will be available for sale in no less than 56 countries around the world. Facing high demand and apparently low supply, the chances to score an iPhone X on launch day are slimmer than ever.
* To put all the chances on your side, we’ve put up together this simple guide filled with tips to help you prepare for the event, and make sure you get an iPhone X on launch day, whether it is in your mailbox or directly in store.
* You basically have two options to get an iPhone on launch day. You can either pre-order it and hope you do it quick enough to get a delivery date of November 3rd, or you can stand in line in front of an Apple Store or an authorized reseller.
* Personally, I prefer to pre-order and avoid getting in line for hours, but that’s just me. Some people like to make an event out of it and hang out with other fanboys all night.
* My strategy is to go for the pre-order first, and if I’m too slow and can’t get my pre-order through with a delivery date of November 3rd, I will then line up in front of an Apple Store.
* The following tips are specifically targeted to people placing a pre-order, but we’ll also have a few tips for people who will have to line up at the door of a store.
* Maybe the most crucial information about iPhone pre-orders are the date and time they officially start. History has showed that being one minute too late can set your order back several weeks, so it is primordial that you know exactly when the pre-orders will open in your specific time zone.
* For those living on the best coast of the US, pre-order time will start at the usual 12:01 a.m. PDT on October 27th. To make it easier for you to figure out what time that is in your location, we have created an event time announcer that lists the exact time and date of the pre-order launch in hundreds of cities across the globe.
* That might sound obvious but think of this as a reminder to make up your mind. Don’t go into pre-orders still on the fence about the finish or storage capacity of the iPhone X you want. Figure it out once and for all and don’t waste one second on this decision the day of.
* I’m going for a Space Gray iPhone X with 64GB of storage.
* Demand is expected to be high and supply is rumored to be extremely low for the iPhone X. As the old adage says, beggars can’t be choosers, and by the time you go through the pre-order process, the exact model you want might already be on back order. If you really want an iPhone X on launch day, decide on a backup iPhone variant in case your preferred model isn’t available.
* A Silver iPhone X with 64GB of storage is my backup variant.
* You can already go to Apple’s website or use the Apple Store application to select your preferred models and save them as favorite. This could save you a considerable amount of time the day of as you won’t have to go through the entire device selection process.
* Insuring your shipping and payment information is up to date prior to placing your order is another step that can help you shave precious seconds during the pre-order process. My advice is to log in to your Apple account and verify not only your payment information but also your shipping details so you don’t have to fill that out manually comes the time to pre-order.
* Instead of clicking on Refresh every 2 seconds to reload Apple’s website on Friday, use the Apple Store application instead. It has proven to be more reliable than the website in the past, and despite having the same features as its browser-based version, the app just feels faster and more practical.
* If you’re going to buy from the Apple Store app or online using Safari, it is also important you make sure your Apple Pay details are up to date. Make sure the credit card you want to use is set up as the default one, and make sure your default shipping address is also filled out correctly.
* On iPhone or iPad, you can go to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay to verify that. On your Mac, go to  > Preferences > Wallet & Apple Pay.
* Once again, this will save you some precious seconds and could be the difference between receiving an iPhone X on November 3rd and receiving it on December 12th.
* Apple’s website is sure to be slammed on Friday morning, but Apple isn’t the only company selling the iPhone X. There are authorized resellers in each country that will likely have iPhone X for pre-order, albeit in very limited quantity.
* I always prefer going through Apple’s website, but if for some reason the site and the app don’t work for you, it might be a good idea to check out other places. Ideally, you would identify these places before Friday and bookmark them for quick and easy access, just in case.
* Let’s assume your pre-order went through. Now you have to wait for it to be delivered at your door. Nonsense! You didn’t stay up late and spend a thousand bucks to sit at home nicely. Take the matter in your own hands and go pick up that iPhone at the shipping facility first thing on November 3rd.
* This is a little known secret but when Apple ships your iPhone via UPS or FedEx, you can put the package on hold at a nearby shipping hub and pick it up early in the morning.
* We’ve put up a guide about how to get your iPhone on Friday morning at 8am sharp which I invite you to consult for more details and step by step instructions.
* If all else fails, then you might want to stop reading this, pack yourself a sandwich, a blanket, a battery pack, and a comfortable beach chair because you’re going to have to get in line at a physical store.
* Figuring out where to get in line is a real conundrum. On one hand, you have Apple Stores that probably have a larger inventory that other retailers, but who likely have a larger crowd lining up in the store fronts. On the other hand, you have carrier stores and other electronics retailers such as Best Buy who might attract a lesser crowd, but who also probably have less inventory than an Apple Store.
* It’s a tough situation that only you can figure out. Personally, I’d go for a carrier or a retailer. Drive by their stores on Thursday night and assess the situation. Some people will likely already be there waiting for the doors to open the next day. Figure out what your plan should be: stay up all night to get in line, or wake up early on Friday morning to line up at the store. Again, only you can make that decision.
* I feel like these tips will help you cover the basis and put all the chances on your side so you can get your precious on November 3rd. As a veteran iPhone buyer, do you have some tips of your own that you’d like to share with other iDB readers?
