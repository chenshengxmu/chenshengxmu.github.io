* SliderWidth is a jailbreak tweak that does exactly what its name states — allows you to adjust the width of your iDevice’s “Slide to Unlock” bar.
* But that’s not the only trick in this tweak’s bag; it also allows you to use custom slider text, remove the Lock camera button or photo frame button, along with being compatible with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

* SliderWidth is nothing groundbreaking, but with the right settings combo, I found it to be fairly pleasing to the eyes.
* Head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo if you’re interested in taking this free jailbreak tweak for a test drive.
* What do you think?
