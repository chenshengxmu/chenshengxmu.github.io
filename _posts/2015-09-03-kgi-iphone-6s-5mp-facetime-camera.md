* Apple’s upcoming ‘iPhone 6s’ and iPhone 6s Plus’ smartphones were previously rumored to incorporate a five-megapixel sensor out the front and now a revered analyst is reaffirming those rumors.
* Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, arguably the most reliable Apple analyst in the world, is reporting in a note to clients, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, that aside from upgrading the back shooter to twelve megapixels, the front-facing camera on the new phones will be five megapixels.
* He surprisingly wrote the devices won’t feature sapphire cover because it’s failed drop tests, forcing the new phones back to ion-strengthened glass. “The new iPhone may not be equipped with sapphire cover lens, as it still has quality issues on the drop test,” reads the analyst’s note to clients.
* Kuo also reaffirmed that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will indeed be offered in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage capacities, the same sizes available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Well-known gadget leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer first alluded that the 16GB tier won’t be going away anytime soon based on a leaked photo of purported iPhone 6s packaging.
* Back in July, a supposed internal document posted on Chinese microblogging website Weibo first suggested a five-megapixel front camera upgrade on the upcoming iPhones.
* I must say that I’m way more excited about the front-camera boost than the vastly improved back-facing 12-megapixel shooter with 4K video capture. I’m sick and tired of grainy selfies due to the iPhone’s sub-par front camera which shoots 720p video but takes only paltry 1.3-megapixel photos.
* The new iPhones should include Force Touch screens, a more reliable Touch ID, a new rose gold color option to match the Apple Watch, faster processors and wireless, enhanced cameras and other perks.
* The phones are up for an announcement at Apple’s event next Wednesday, alongside the iPad Pro, iPad mini 4 and a vastly improved Apple TV set-top box.
