* Today, Apple released the developer preview of its latest mobile operating system, iOS 10. With great new improvements to iMessage, Apple Music, and Maps, the new iOS 10 will be available to the public this fall. You can see a full round up of the new features from our WWDC coverage.
* As quickly as the round up ended, I began getting requests for the new wallpapers via @jim_gresham, which I use to gather images for iDB’s Wallpapers of the Week. If you have any leads, send them my way.
* Thankfully, due to the Twitter community, we are able to present you with the iOS 10 wallpapers for iPhone and iPad, in the article below.
* Thanks to the handy work of @hori_42, he was able to extract the image from an Apple product image on the website and optimize it for iPad. We received a link to the same, for iPhone, from @chrisalcntra.
