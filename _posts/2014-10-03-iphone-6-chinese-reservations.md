* Reservations for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in China have already topped 4 million, reports Tencent. The Chinese media outlet says that demand for the two new handsets is strong in the country, with reservations hitting 2 million in just 6 hours, and 4 million in within the first day.
* Note, this number does not include official iPhone 6 pre-orders, which haven’t started yet. Apple announced on September 29 that it had picked up the necessary approval to sell its two new smartphones in China, and told customers that pre-orders would begin Tuesday, October 14.
* Both new iPhones will support TD-LTE and FDD-LTE, and be offered by China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom across mainland China. China Mobile and China Unicom are among the top largest carriers in the world, with 800 million and 300 million subscribers, respectively.
* The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus officially launch in China on October 17, one month after going on sale here in the US. A lot of eyes will be keeping watch of the sales numbers there, as the country is a very important market for Apple, and the two devices have been extremely successful thus far.
