title: New Apple Watches registered on Eurasian database ahead of possible refresh
---
* French outlet Consomac has spotted several unreleased Apple Watch devices that were recently added to the Eurasian Economic Commission’s (EEC) database. This is one of the ways worldwide that companies must register new products that use encryption before releasing them to the public. In total, six new Apple Watch devices were discovered.

* The findings include new wearable devices with model numbers of A1977, A1978, A1975, A1976, A2007, and A2008. The devices run watchOS 5, which was first announced by Apple in June. The filings are for devices set to be sold in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.
* Apple’s likely to announce an all-new Apple Watch in just a few weeks alongside 2018 iPhones and iPad Pros. The new wearable device is expected to feature the first design refresh since the product was first released in 2015.
* The company is also expected to announce updated Macs in the coming weeks, including a next-generation MacBook, iMac, and Mac mini.
* When new Apple products are discovered on the EEC database, it typically takes about 30 days before they are released to the public. Earlier this year, the 2018 budget iPad was found in the database in February. The new product launched a month later.
* Last month, leaks were discussed just days before Apple announced the 2018 MacBook Pro lineup.
* Which 2018 product are you most excited about seeing? Let us know below.
