title: Cydia repos buckle under evasi0n traffic

* Earlier today, planetbeing announced that evasi0n saw over 100,000 downloads within 10 minutes of its release. The pent-up demand for the iOS 6 jailbreak was clear, as an influx of visitors crashed the evad3rs’ website.
* That excess traffic has also seemingly crippled Cydia this morning. Although the app itself loads fine, we’re finding it nearly impossible to access our Store accounts, or download any apps or tweaks from the main repos…
* If you have problems with Cydia sources, it’s ok, it’s just that they are under heavy load at the moment. Try again later.

* The biggest problem appears to be with previously purchased and paid apps. Their Cydia pages aren’t fully loading, and they show either an infinite spinning ‘loading’ icon, or an Install button that leads to a blank or error page.
* Here are some of the most common errors we’re seeing:
* Of course, some users are saying that it’s been working fine for them albeit running slower than usual. Either way, it appears that Cydia and its repositories are no match for the million+ people that are expected to jailbreak today.
* Our best advice? As pod2g says, your best bet is trying again a little bit later. There’s nothing, that we know about anyway, that can be done from the user-end that will fix this problem.
* How’s Cydia been working for you?
* Update: Saurik has commented on the Cydia outages:
* “So, the thing that is different about this jailbreak is that @evad3rs provided a specific time; normally, usage follows a wave of discovery. However, with the help of David, the on-call support agent from@CDNetworks, I was able to rapidly rearchitect my repository setup: it’s up!”
