* Without mentioning sources, DigiTimes reported Wednesday that the widely expected shift from LCD to OLED screens will necessitate a thin-film solution for iPhone 8’s 3D Touch module instead of the older glass solution adopted for 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s/7 series. Suppliers behind the new 3D Touch modules are dropping big bucks on advanced factories to retain the precision that Apple demands.
* Apple suppliers and touch panel makers General Interface Solution and TPK Holding have reportedly allocated millions of dollars to expand capacity to produce next-generation 3D Touch panels for 2017 iPhones, with the former spending about $163 million, and the latter allocating a budget of $152 million towards fab facilities.
* Because the manufacturing process for the film-based pressure-sensing 3D Touch module is more complicated, cost will rise from about $9 for the existing glass-based 3D Touch sensor to more than $15 for its thin film-based counterpart.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously estimated that the production cost of iPhone 8’s 3D Touch solution may increase by up to $5 per unit. The new 3D Touch module should enhance user experience with such perks as increased sensitivity and a wider range of pressure levels, said the analyst.

* Kuo also expects all three 2017 iPhones to feature wireless charging technology.
* A recent report said iPhone 8 might cost upwards of $1,000 due to new technologies such as a curved OLED screen, wireless charging, an advanced augmented reality camera system with facial recognition and 3D sensing and more.
* Major Apple analysts, supply chain sources and various publications predicted that iPhone 8 may not enter volume production before September while the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus devices are expected to be mass-produced starting in July, like prior iPhone generations.
* If true, Apple will find itself in a unique situation where iPhone 8 could be pre-announced in September before its arrival later in the year.
* As per Mac Otakara, iPhone 8 won’t launch until well after a September announcement.
