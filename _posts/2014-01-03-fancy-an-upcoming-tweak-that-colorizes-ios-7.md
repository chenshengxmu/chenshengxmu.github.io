* It’s tweak paradise for jailbreakers right now; tons of tweaks and apps have been hitting the wire as of late, and there’s no sign of it slowing down any time soon. You know that things have gotten back to normal when you start to see previews of tweaks—unreleased items that are teased as they’re being worked on.
* One of the first unreleased tweaks that I’ve gotten to play with is Fancy. Fancy is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows users to colorize certain prominent iOS 7 features. This means that you can colorize things like Notification Center, Control Center, banner notifications, Volume HUD, the dock, and more.
* Fancy is one of those tweaks that may not seem very cool when hearing it described, but changes your mind completely after seeing it in action. For that reason, I urge you to have a look at our full video walkthrough that’s been posted after the break.
* After installing Fancy, which will presumably be available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo after its release, a new Settings panel will be placed near the bottom of the stock Settings app. Here, you can configure colorization for the various pieces that make up iOS 7.

* Fancy features the ability to set a global tint color that will apply one color to all areas influenced by the tweak. While this is the best way to ensure tint uniformity, some may desire to have different colors of tint apply to different sections of iOS. For instance, you may wish for Control Center to have purple tint, while the Notification Center has yellow tint. That’s totally feasible with Fancy, as long as you take advantage of the individual section overrides.
* Included with Fancy is the ability to add color overrides to the following sections:
* Each of these sections can take on any of the following colors:
* These colors can be applied as a global tint color, or can apply to the individual sections mentioned above on a section-by-section basis. As you might imagine, none of the tint changes require a user to respring his or her device, the color changes are instantaneous and made in real time.

* If there’s one thing to take away from my hands-on time with Fancy, it’s that it looks much more compelling when you get to try it hands-on. I also hope that the developer considers implementing RGB sliders, so that users may come up with a custom palette of colors to use along with the canned colors.
* Speaking of the developer, this tweak is from a very well-known member of the community. It’s from Mitch Treece. While that name may not ring a bell, the name SBCoders just might. Mitch is behind SBCoders, the same name behind awesome tweaks like Dash, Deck and Aero. It’s good to have Mitch back into camp jailbreak, even if he’s no longer using the SBCoders name as prominently.
* Fancy will be available in the coming days for jailbroken iOS 7 devices. Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
