* Bad news for Samsung as rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been predicted to account for a cool 100 percent of orders for Apple’s next-generation A10 processor expect to serve as the powerful engine for 2016 iPhones and iPads.
* Taiwanese media quoted a JP Morgan analyst as saying that Samsung will be left out entirely from the lucrative contract to build these chipsets. The current A9 and A9X processors are being built by both TSMC and Samsung.
* As you have probably heard by now, it’s been discovered that TSMC-built iPhones are a bit more power efficient than the ones outfitted with the Samsung-built A9 chipset.
* According to the report, it’s this gap in performance and battery life between the A9 chips manufactured by TSMC and Samsung which has prompted Apple to source the A10 chipset exclusively from TSMC.

* The A10 chips are said to be manufactured using TSMC’s InFO architecture.
* As for the current A9 and A9X chipsets, these packages are being manufactured on Samsung’s 14-nanometer process and TSMC’s 16-nanometer FinFET process technology.
* Apple has confirmed that battery performance between the Samsung and TSMC variations of the iPhone 6s differs by two to three percent.
