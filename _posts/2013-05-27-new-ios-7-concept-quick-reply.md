* With WWDC now just a few weeks away, and more details about iOS 7 coming light, anticipation for Apple’s next-gen mobile operating system is  almost through the roof. Everyone wants to know what the company has planned for the future of its platform.
* Well if these two designers get their way, iOS 7 will include a number of new features like support for panoramic wallpapers and quick reply for messages. Here’s a new iOS 7 concept from Christian Lue of ChanluChannel and Ran Avni of ConceptsiPhone…
* Overall I really like the ideas proposed in the concept. I’ve been longing for a stock quick reply feature for a long time, and who doesn’t want to see new Siri features added? I also like the idea of redesigned folder icons and action menus in the Music app.
* As for panoramic wallpaper support, it’s never been on my personal wish list. But I know that it’s been on Android for quite a while, and a lot of folks have been asking for it on iOS. The good news is, rumor has it that Apple has finally added it this time around.
* And as for the rest of iOS 7, it’s expected to look substantially different from its predecessors with less skeuomorphism and more of a flat UI design. Of course, we won’t know anything for sure until Apple unveils the new mobile OS at WWDC next month.
* What are your thoughts on today’s concept?
