* Old Apple Watch apps built with legacy watchOS SDKs produce a warning when launched in watchOS 4.3.1. On watchOS 5 and later, such apps refuse to open at all.
* The obvious goal here is removing legacy WatchKit apps that are built with the outdated watchOS SDK versions that don’t take advantage of the latest hardware and software technologies.
* In November 2017, Apple gave developers a heads-up warning that it would soon stop accepting updates to watchOS 1 apps. “This app will not work with future versions of watchOS,” reads the warning message in watchOS 4.3.1.
* Apple completely dropped support for those apps in watchOS 5.

* A warning when launching a legacy watch app in watchOS 4.3.1
* As of April 2018, the Cupertino technology giant is no longer accepting any updates to existing apps that are built with the watchOS 1 SDK, as well as new apps built with the watchOS 3 SDK. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing because those apps were very slow,  relied on a connected iPhone and didn’t support cellular on LTE-equipped watches.
* TUTORIAL: How to identify legacy Mac apps
* If you’re still on watchOS 4.3.x, you may have seen this warning already. If not, here’s how to see if the apps on your watch have been built with the watchOS 4 SDK or later to ensure they’ll run properly after updating to the watchOS 5 software.
* Here’s how.
* To see if you have any outdated watchOS apps, do the following:
* 1) Open the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone.
* 2) Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom.
* 3) Now scroll all the way to the bottom of the list of available apps.

* 4) If you see the entry labeled Unavailable Apps, some of the apps installed on this watch (or those installed on your iPhone that came with a watchOS component, ready to be installed on your watch) won’t open on watchOS 5. Tap Unavailable Apps to proceed.

* Any legacy apps built with the watchOS 1, 2 or 3 SDK are listed here.
* 5) Choose an unsupported app from the list, then tap it.
* 6) From there, tap Delete App & Associate Data if you’d like to do just that.
* And that’s how you identify any deprecated apps on your Apple Watch.
* “These apps don’t work with watchOS 5 and must be updated to continue using them,” reads Apple’s description. “If no update is available, contact the app developer for more information.”
* TUTORIAL: How to identify legacy apps on iPhone and iPad
* You could reach out to the app developer in question and ask them if they are planning on releasing a compatibility update anytime soon, but good luck with that.
* That’s because major apps—like Google Maps, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, Twitterrific, Instagram and others—no longer offer a watchOS component because their developers can no longer justify spending time and pouring resources into their development and maintenance.
* iOS 10.3 and up included a similar message about a pending shift away from 32-bit apps in favor of 64-bit apps. Beginning with iOS 11, Apple no longer supports 32-bit iPhone and iPad apps.
