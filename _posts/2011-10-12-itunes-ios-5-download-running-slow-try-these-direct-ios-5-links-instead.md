* My iOS 5 iTunes download has been stuck on 4 minutes remaining for about 15 minutes now, with no signs of budging. Thankfully, the direct download firmware links are usually a lot faster than going through iTunes itself.
* Head over to our downloads page for direct downloads for every supported iOS 5 device…
* To use these files, just download and choose “Restore” in iTunes while holding Option (Mac) or Shift (Windows) key.
* Where these direct download links faster for you?
