* Google wants to make it even easier for Apple fans to switch from iOS to the Android platform so it’s turning the mobile Google Drive app into a migration tool of sorts with new features that let you upload and synchronize your contacts, photos, videos and calendar events.
* The search giant also provides a Quick Switch Adapter with its Pixel smartphones that allows users to quickly transfers data directly from an iPhone to their Pixel phone.
* Google Drive is available at no charge from the App Store.
* The new wizard that allows you to back up your content is available by selecting Menu → Settings → Backup in the updated Google Drive app. Simply choose the content that you want to back up or tap Start Backup to back up everything: your contacts, calendar events, photos and videos.
* Contacts are backed up to Google Contacts, calendar events to Google Calendar and photos/videos to Google Photos. Google says backing up may take several hours so you’re advise to connect your device to power and Wi-Fi. Due to iOS limitations, you must keep the app open and on screen until the backup process is complete.

* Then, on your Android device, sign in with the same Google account that you used to back up your iPhone to access your content. To make the migration process even easier, Google published a new webpage detailing how switching to Android works.
* Google Drive is available in the App Store for free.
