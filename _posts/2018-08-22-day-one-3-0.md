* Day One, the superb journaling app for iPhone, iPad and Mac, was bumped to version 3.0 yesterday. The iOS-focused update introduced several new features, including a new Dark Mode-like option, the ability to record up to 30 minutes of audio, a whole new editor and more.
* The Dark Mode option and audio recording require Day One Premium.
* You can now switch between the default light look and the new darkened interface within Day One’s settings. Tip: look for a new option to have Day One automatically switch between Light and Dark Mode based on your current location and time. Users can now record up to 30 minutes of audio, and the app now also supports transcription via macOS’s dictation feature.
* The new editor, which developer Bloom Built says was designed and built from the ground up “for a superior writing experience,” has seen major improvements.
* You can now just tap anywhere you’d like to position the cursor to immediately start editing. There’s a new menu for adding images, audio, tags, photo grids and checklists.
* Want to quickly apply some formatting to your posts?
* No problem, just tap the “Aa” icon to bring up a popup menu with your header styles, indents, lists and formatting features like bold, italics, underline, code block, rule line and more. Markdown support has seen some improvements as well, with automatic conversions of headers, lists, bold and italic into richly formatted text.
* The new editor is available to both free and paid users.
* Here’s everything worth mentioning in Day One 3.0 for iOS.
* By the way, developers noted on Twitter that the new version contains a bug that may make accounts appear as downgraded. They are advising users to force-quit, then re-launch the app.
* Day One for iOS and Day One for macOS are free to download, with optional subscriptions available via the In-App Purchase mechanism priced at $34.99 per year.
* Day One users who previously paid for the app before it adopted a subscription model get a lifetime discount on the yearly subscription for $24.99 per year.
