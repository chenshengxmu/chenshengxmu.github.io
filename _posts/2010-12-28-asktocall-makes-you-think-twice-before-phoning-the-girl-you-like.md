title: AskToCall Makes You Think Twice Before Phoning the Girl You Like

* If you have a hard time asking out that girl that you’re interested in, then definitely stay away from AskToCall, otherwise you’ll never call her.
* AskToCall is basically the phone version of AskToSend, another jailbreak tweak that helps you second guess your sending of SMS and email messages.
* Once installed, there are no apps or settings to configure, but you will notice a new prompt every time you dial from your favorites, recents or contacts…
* Whereas I can see the practicality of an app like AskToSend, since I send many more emails and text messages than I do phone calls, I just can’t see where AskToCall would be beneficial in the majority of people’s circumstances.

* Obviously, there are times when I’ve inadvertently dialed a number, but those occurrences are few and far between. If you’re like me, I find it’s much easier to catch foot-in-mouth syndrome with a text message or an email.
* Perhaps if there was an app that allowed you to verify the words you spoke prior to doing so, then we’d be talking about something really useful.
* In essence, AskToCall will help you second guess whether or not you want to call someone, but it can’t do much for you once that someone picks up on the other end.
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone, AskToCall can be downloaded for free on Cydia.
* Does it sound like something you would use?
