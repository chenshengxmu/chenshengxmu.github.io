* Apple tonight posted a new commercial to its YouTube channel showcasing the recently-launched iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The ad is entitled ‘Voice Text’ and it highlights the new voice messaging feature found on iOS 8 and of course the new iPhones.
* Coming just a few days after the last two spots, the ad once again stars Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake. In similar fashion to recent ads, the pair provide comedic voiceovers as they demonstrate the benefits of voice messaging.

* It seems like Apple is going to be sticking with this Fallon-Timberlake format for a while, even with the holidays rapidly approaching. What do you think of the recent iPhone ads?
