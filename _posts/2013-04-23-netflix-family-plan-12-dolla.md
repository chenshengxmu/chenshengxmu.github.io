* Following the version 4.0 release of its iPhone and iPad app yesterday, Netflix announced that it was going to be rolling out a host of new “family friendly” features over the next few months. And it looks like the first is going to be a new family plan.
* Traditionally, folks pay $8 per month for Netflix’s service, which allows for unlimited streaming of its content to up to 5 devices—2 devices simultaneously. But with the new family plan, families can stream to up to 4 devices at the same time…
* From Netflix’s letter to shareholders:
* “A few members with large families run into our 2-simultaneous-stream limit. To best serve these members, we’re shortly adding a 4-stream plan, at $11.99 in the U.S., and we expect fewer than 1% of members to take it.”
* The company also noted that it has been testing a new “profiles” feature, which separates activity between individuals. This allows users to login to the service to view their own Queues, viewing history and more. And it’ll be rolling out in a few months.
* In addition to its new family-oriented initiative, Netflix announced that it now has 29.2 million active users in the United States. Interestingly enough, as Quartz points out, that’s bigger—for the first time ever—than HBO’s domestic subscription base.
* Netflix is available on practically any electronic device these days, offering up access to thousands of movies and TV shows from all genres. And over the last 6 months, it’s even begun releasing its own content with ‘House of Cards’ and ‘Hemlock Grove.’
