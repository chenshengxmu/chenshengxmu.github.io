* Alongside the new iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display, Apple announced a small update for the first-gen iPad mini on Tuesday. The (non-Retina) tablet has been given a small price reduction, and a new ‘Space Gray’ colorway.
* And according to a new report, some retail stores have quietly begun stocking these new minis on their shelves—meaning they’re now available for purchase. So if you’re interested, it might be worth checking your local Apple Store…
* Citing anonymous sources, 9to5Mac is reporting that several Apple retail locations have begun receiving non-Retina iPad minis in Space Gray. They only come in one flavor, 16GB, but both Wi-Fi and Cellular models are available.
* Of course, the Space Gray has been available on Apple.com since Tuesday

* The Space Gray option replaces the previous black/slate combination, but the white and silver version is still available. Both tablets will run you $299 for the 16GB Wi-Fi model ($30 off previous price), and $429 for Wi-Fi + Cellular.
* In addition to the non-Retina mini, Apple will also be keeping the iPad 2 around for $399. And in November, these two slates will be joined by the all-new iPad Air (November 1) and iPad mini with Retina display (late November).
* I think the Space Gray mini looks pretty sharp, what about you?
