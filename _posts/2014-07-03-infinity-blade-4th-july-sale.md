* Tomorrow is the Fourth of July, also known as Independence Day, a federal holiday in the U.S. commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain.
* ChAIR Entertainment, the brains behind the Infinity Blade series, an iOS-exclusive elegiac masterpiece, has now discounted all three Infinity Blade games.
* In celebration of Independence Day, you can now grab all three games for as little as six bucks compared to their combined regular value of twenty bucks…
* “Celebrate Independence Day with the Infinity Blade 1, 2 and 3, for the 4th Brand Sale,” wrote ChAIR in iTunes release notes. “All three of ChAIR’s blockbuster iOS games are on sale this holiday weekend.”
* Infinity Blade 1 normally costs six bucks, but now it’s available for just 99 cents. The download comes in at 624 megabytes.
* Infinity Blade 2 is now available for $1.99, down from its normal asking price of $6.99. The game back in May went temporarily free as Apple’s Free App of the Week. The download comes in at 1.1 gigabytes.
* Infinity Blade 3 will set you back $2.99, as opposed to its normal price of $6.99. The download comes in at a massive 1.82 gigabytes.
* Here’s a trailer for the Infinity Blade 3 ‘Blade Masters’ pack, which introduces The Collector, a new character who stalks Siris and Isa throughout the game.
* All three games are universal, with the the third installment in the series specifically optimized for Apple’s speedy A7 chip powering the iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display.
* Moreover, ChAIR is regularly expanding these games with massive content packs, provided free of charge to those who’ve purchased the games.
* Powered by Epic Games’ Unreal Engine and exclusive to iOS devices, the Infinity Blade series is the equivalent of system-sellers on consoles and among the apps you should keep on your device to showcase the power of iOS hardware to your Android-totting friends.
