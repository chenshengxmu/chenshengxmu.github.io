* Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour made its way into the App Store last December and today French developer Gameloft is teasing a forthcoming update. Titled ‘Meltdown,’ the content update is of course free to players who bought the game and will be available on iOS starting Thursday, June 19, and “coming very soon” to Android.
* The trailer included right below the fold mentions three new maps (Fracture, Extraction and Backfire), two new game modes and a brand new specialization (Demolition)…
* Oh, and there will be two new weapons, the portable 40mm Thor GLP grenade launcher and the SFS CTK-12 sniper rifle.
* From YouTube description:
* Get ready to be blown away by Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour’s Meltdown update. Discover tons of explosive new content: New maps from Antarctica to Barcelona, new modes, new weapons, and a new Demolition specialization!
* Here’s the trailer.
* Earlier, Modern Combat 4’s first update brought us the Tygr X3 automatic SMG and the Compakt-665 solid multipurpose automatic assault rifle.
* Modern Combat 4, as the name implies, is the fourth installment in Gameloft’s widely successful first-person shooter series. Powered by the new Havok Engine, the game delivers life-like animations, dynamic objects and console-quality visuals.
* Perhaps most importantly, there’s a redesigned multiplayer mode with all-new ranking and a new loadout system with more than 20,000 weapon arrangements.
* Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour will set you back seven bucks via Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play store. In the case of Apple’s platform, the universal binary weighs in at a massive 1.54GB.
* If you’re a fan of the genre, you may also want to check out an E3 trailer for the upcoming Modern Combat 5.
