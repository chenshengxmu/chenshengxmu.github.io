* A third-generation Apple Watch with LTE has reportedly entered the “final testing phase” in the manufacturing process ahead of its planned September reveal alongside iPhone 8.
* According to a new Chinese-language Economic Daily News report yesterday, cited by DigiTimes, both the Wi-Fi and LTE cellular models have now entered the final testing phase.
* The devices will come in 38mm and 42mm sizes, like the current models, indicating that the Apple Watch Series 3 family will retain full compatibility with all of the existing bands.
* The report added that the next Apple Watch would come with enhanced battery life and the much expected phone calling function without the need for a paired iPhone nearby.
* OPINION: Why cellular Apple Watch could be a game changer
* However, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that LTE models won’t support cellular voice calling at launch, instead focusing on delivering data to users faster.
* The cellular voice calling feature will be enabled via a software update next year, he said.

* Kuo separately wrote that the device won’t look much different from the existing models.
* While Apple will likely announce LTE Apple Watch alongside iPhone 7s/Plus and iPhone 8 in September, the wearable device probably won’t start shipping until later in the fourth quarter.
* Indeed, today’s report states that the sole Apple Watch manufacturer Quanta Computer will begin shipping Series 3 models to Apple in the fourth quarter of 2017 at the earliest.
