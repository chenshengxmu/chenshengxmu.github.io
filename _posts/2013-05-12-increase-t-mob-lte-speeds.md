* T-Mobile subscribers are still getting used to having access to the iPhone, and those with existing AT&T unlocked iPhone 5 received a carrier update to add LTE support for T-Mobile’s frequency. Unfortunately, that’s not all it did.
* Turns out that update may have also limited the bandwidth available to T-Mobile customers using one of those unlocked handsets, leaving them with something of a gimped LTE service. Bummer, right?
* Well, remember the guy that worked out how jailbroken iPhone users could enable T-Mobile’s LTE before the aforementioned carrier update? That same clever man has also worked out how to give T-Mobile the bandwidth you’d expect from one of the hottest LTE handsets on the market. And you don’t even need to be jailbroken for it to work…
* The process is actually relatively easy to follow, and involves forcing a new carrier update onto the phone in question. The whole thing is laid out courtesy of TmoNews, and it covers both Windows and Mac users so you should be set.
* For those who like the geeky stuff, the new carrier update actually enables Release 9 DC-HSPA+ on the iPhone 5. T-Mobile doesn’t actually support that, but switching it on on an iPhone 5 has the affect of opening it up to the increased bandwidth that we’re after. Simple, isn’t it? No, we wouldn’t have worked it out for ourselves, either.
* You can find these instructions on TmoNews.
* Good? Good!
* Have you noticed any improvement after giving this a whirl?
