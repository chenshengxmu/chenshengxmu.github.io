* Earlier this week, we told you that a big update for the popular emulator GBA4iOS was coming soon. The developers said that it would be launching today, February 19, and they have delivered on that promise. GBA4iOS 2.0 is now available for installation.
* Among the many additions to the Game Boy emulator is iPad support, iOS 7 controller support and Dropbox integration. More importantly, the app is now much easier to install, as it does not require you to be jailbroken or to change your device’s date…
* Using the new GBA4iOS, gamers can play ROMs for Game Boy Advanced, Game Boy Color and originally Gameboy games. There are a number of titles available that support this media, and the app includes a built-in web browser for finding them.

* GBA4iOS 2.0 also supports various cheats, including Game Genie and Action Replay. It also offers full iOS 7 controller support and third party controller skins, and if you have a Dropbox account, you can store game saves and load ROMs using the cloud service. 
* So where can you get it? Well given Apple’s track record for removing emulators from the App Store, GBA4iOS decided to go with a workaround solution and let users install the app directly from their website. Just click here to install it while on an iPad or iPhone.
* Note: Though GBA4iOS 2.0 doesn’t require a data change, the developers say that the device may need to be set back to 2/19/14 if the app fails to open.
