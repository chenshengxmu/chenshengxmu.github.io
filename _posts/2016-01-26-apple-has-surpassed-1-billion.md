* “Our installed base recently crossed a major milestone of one billion active devices,” Tim Cook said in a statement for the company’s Q1 2016 earnings press release. The news comes on the back of a record-breaking quarter, where Apple sold 74.8M iPhones and garnered nearly $76 billion in revenue during the 3-month holiday period.
* Here is his full quote from the press release:
* “Our team delivered Apple’s biggest quarter ever, thanks to the world’s most innovative products and all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The growth of our Services business accelerated during the quarter to produce record results, and our installed base recently crossed a major milestone of one billion active devices.”
* This is the first time Apple has shared such a figure, although it’s not surprising. In October, Tim Cook announced that it had sold over 300 million devices during the previous 12 months. It’s unknown, however, which products he is counting as part of the 1 billion+ total, which could include everything from Apple Watches to MacBooks.
