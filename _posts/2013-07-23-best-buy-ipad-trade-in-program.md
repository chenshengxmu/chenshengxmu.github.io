* Best Buy is set to bring back its iPad trade-in program today, according to a new report. The retailer debuted the program earlier this month as part of a two-day promotion, which allowed iPad owners to trade-in their devices for late generation models.
* The deal is very much the same this time around, with Best Buy offering iPad 2 and 3 owners gift cards for their tablets, starting at $200, to be used towards the purchase of a fourth gen. We’ve posted the leaked internal employee memo after the fold…
* Here’s the memo posted by 9to5Mac:

* The site notes that the move is a part of the retailer’s campaign to close out the fiscal quarter strong—it’s also been offering $50 gift cards with iPad purchases this month. The promo will run through August 3, and all non-damaged iPad 2 and 3 models apply.
* As usual, it’s worth noting here that Apple is widely expected to be on the verge of launching a new version of its iPad. The tablet, which is said to feature an all-new, thinner design, will likely debut sometime in the next few months alongside the iPhone 5S.
