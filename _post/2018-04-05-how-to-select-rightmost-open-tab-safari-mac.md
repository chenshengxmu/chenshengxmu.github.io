* If you’re going to make the most of Safari as your desktop browser, it might make sense to memorize some of the best keyboard shortcuts to supercharge your browsing workflow.
* This is especially true for folks who have dozens of open tabs at any given time. Safari for Mac provides you with many productivity-infused keyboard shortcuts that save time, including a trio of essential keyboard combinations for quickly switching between your open tabs.

* The macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 software update brought out yet another powerful shortcut for quickly getting to the rightmost tab. This is a handy productivity feature for those times when you have more tabs than fit Safari’s tab bar.
* It’s only available on Macs that run macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 or higher so be sure to update your copy of macOS to the latest version available by choosing App Store from the Apple menu, then click the Updates tab.
* To get to the rightmost open tab in Safari for Mac, press Command (⌘)-9 on the keyboard.
* Again, this particular shortcut requires that macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 or later be installed on your Mac. If you have an older macOS edition, pressing the same shortcut will select your ninth tab from the left. In case you didn’t know, you can jump quickly to any of your first eight tabs by pressing Command (⌘)-1 to Command (⌘)-8.

* macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and up allows jumping to the rightmost open tab using Command-9
* You can cycle through your open tabs even faster with a trackpad gesture: when there are more tabs than fit in Safari’s tab area, use your trackpad to swipe left or right over the tab bar to scroll through your open tabs like a pro.
