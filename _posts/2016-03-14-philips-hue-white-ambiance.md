* Philips today announced it’s expanded its Hue smart lighting system with a brand new light bulb that focuses on the many shades of white light in order to encourage better sleep cycles, helping you wake up naturally and drift to sleep more peacefully.
* The Apple HomeKit-compatible, color-tunable bulb gives you 800 lumens at the color temperature range from 2,200k to 6,500k, imitating the changing daily brightness and color temperature of natural sunlight. Philips also offers a starter kit that includes a pair of white ambiance bulbs, a bridge and a dimmer switch.
* Inspired by the sun, the new bulb can gradually brighten to help you wake up naturally and gently dim to help you drift to sleep more peacefully.
* “By having every shade of white light at your fingertips, you can choose the perfect light you need to feel better, whether you want an energizing light for exercising or a dimmed nightlight for winding down to sleep,” said the firm.

* The starter kit makes it easy to control all your Hue lights via the mobile Hue app, using Siri voice control and your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch. And with the portable Hue dimmer switch, everyone can turn the lights on, off or access the light recipes.
* The mobile app also has a feature called “Wake Up” which gently increases the smart bulb in brightness to naturally wake you up in the morning on time.
* Similarly, the “Go to sleep” setting gradually dims the light until it is off, preparing your body for falling asleep. And last but not least, a new light recipe called “Nightlight” delivers a low level of light whilst also minimizing exposure to blue light, lessening the disturbance to your sleep cycle.

* Hue hardware integrates with the Nest Learning thermostat, Nest Cam, Nest Protect and other home devices such as Amazon’s Alexa. In addition, more than 600 third party apps are now compatible with the Hue, like the SleepCycle alarm clock and many others.
* The new white ambiance lamps will be available from spring 2016. Integrated luminaires will be available from fall 2016 across Europe and North America.
* Pricing is yet to be determined.
