* We’ve all been there before. It’s late, and it’s dark, but you still have to get a few more things to get done. You set your iPhone’s screen to its lowest possible brightness via Control Center, and you quickly realize that even at the lowest setting, the screen is way too bright for your eyes in such a dark environment.
* What can you do in a situation like this? You could jailbreak and install a jailbreak tweak like Dim, but that’s not always an option, nor is it always desirable.
* Fortunately, there is a way to quickly adjust screen brightness levels even lower than what’s possible via Control Center’s brightness slider. By leveraging some of iOS’ built-in accessibility features, you can set your iPhone’s screen brightness levels much lower than you think.
* Step 1: Open Settings → General → Accessibility
* Step 2: Tap Zoom → and enable the Zoom switch
* Step 3: Triple-tap the screen with three fingers to invoke the overlay
* Step 4: Tap Full Screen Zoom
* Step 5: Slide the zoom slider all the way to the left to zoom out completely
* Step 6: Tap Choose Filter → Low Light
* Step 7: Tap on a portion of the screen to dismiss the overlay
* Step 8: Go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Accessibility Shortcut and tap Zoom
* Step 9: Triple click on the Home button to switch between lower brightness and normal brightness
* You can now use this triple-click gesture to quickly switch between brightness levels on your iPhone. You’ll notice that you can make the screen significantly dimmer with the shortcut enabled. In fact, if you enable the shortcut while in a bright room, the screen becomes almost unreadable.
* Needless to say, this is a great way to save your eyes when using your iPhone in a dark environment. It’s also handy when you wish to quickly switch between two differing brightness levels on the fly without invoking Control Center.
* Yes, quite a few steps are required to get this set up, but once it is, you’re pretty much set going forward. As someone who’s been using this method since I willingly relinquished my iPhone 6s jailbreak last month, take my word for it when I say it’s well worth the time investment.
