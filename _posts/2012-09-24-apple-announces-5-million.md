* Apple has announced that it sold a record-breaking 5 million iPhone 5s during its three day launch weekend, besting its previous record set by the iPhone 4S last year by more than a million.
* The numbers shouldn’t surprise anyone, considering the amount of demand we’ve seen for the device thus far. Apple said last week that it sold more than 2 million units in its first 24 hours…
* The news comes by way of a press release (via MacRumors) issued by the company early this morning:
* “Demand for iPhone 5 has been incredible and we are working hard to get an iPhone 5 into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “While we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date. We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone.”
* The iPhone 5 is currently only available in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and the UK, but it is slated to launch in 22 more countries this Friday.
* Additionally, Apple also announced that more than 100 million iOS devices have been updated to iOS 6 — which is huge considering it’s only been available to the public for what, five days?
