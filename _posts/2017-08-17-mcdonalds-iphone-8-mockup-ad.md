* Fast food giant McDonald’s lit up social media around the world today with an interesting email campaign promoting its mobile-ordering app in Australia that wouldn’t be worth a mention if it weren’t for the fact that the ad is based on an iPhone 8 mockup image.
* Even better than that, smartphone leakster Benjamin Geskin has confirmed on Twitter that they actually took his own iPhone 8 rendering for the email campaign, likely without permission.
* As firs noted by MacRumors, the company on Thursday sent out that email to many of its customers in Australia.
* As you can see for yourself top of post, the message uses unofficial iPhone 8 graphics complete with that infamous notch at the top of the device’s OLED display.
* It didn’t seem to bother advertising teams at McDonald’s that the rendering shows circles for the cellular signal strength indicator which Apple switched to bars in iOS 11.
* Is this just a smart PR stunt on the company’s part or has some overzealous designer from their marketing department really messed up, do you think?
* Post your thoughts in the comments!
