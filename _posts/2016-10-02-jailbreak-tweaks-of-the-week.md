* With the launch of the new iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, and the release of iOS 10 not too long ago, the jailbreak is in a bit of a lull right now. Nevertheless, Cydia is still surprising us with new jailbreak tweak releases throughout the week, and we’ve been covering them as they’ve been launched.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you all the jailbreak tweaks that were released this week, starting with our favorites.
* Vinculum – $0.99
