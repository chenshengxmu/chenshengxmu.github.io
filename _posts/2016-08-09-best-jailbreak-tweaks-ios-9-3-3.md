* Ever since the jailbreak for iOS 9.2-9.3.3 was released by Pangu, there has been a lot of confusion about the jailbreak. Slowly, but surely, the answers to everyone’s questions are coming out into the light, and we’ve made a jailbreak FAQ posting to answer most of them.
* On the other hand, one of the biggest benefits to jailbreaking is being able to install jailbreak tweaks to modify your device to your liking. In this piece, we’ll talk about some of the best jailbreak tweaks you can install on iOS 9.3.3 right now.
* Let’s face it. There are a myriad of jailbreak tweaks in Cydia; so many, that I can’t even remember them all. Nevertheless, these are some of the best that I can remember reviewing over the years I’ve spent covering jailbreak tweaks that work on iOS 9.3.3 as of this writing.

* Activator has been an instant classic for iOS since what feels like the beginning of jailbreaking. This extension lets you perform actions from your device with various gestures that you could only dream of Apple ever implementing in the stock operating system. You can then assign those gestures nearly any action you want to. If you don’t like Activator, then there might just be something wrong with you.

* For those of you who get bored using the same-old stock iOS folders for everything, and just want a cleaner way to group similar apps, such as Facebook with Facebook Messenger, or all your Google apps under the Google Search app, Apex 2 is a great way to get this done. This tweak hides all the similar apps behind the main one and makes it easy to expand and collapse the related apps so they’re not taking up precious Home screen space.

* Without a doubt, Auxo is probably one of my favorite jailbreak tweaks for iOS 7+ of all time, and Auxo 3 works on iOS 9.3.3, as it was recently updated by its developer. The tweak integrates the App Switcher and Control Center interfaces into one, and even includes a useful ‘kill all’ feature for all the apps that appear there. The tweak also provides a useful Hot Corners function, as well as a quicker way to multitask.

* Barrel is one of the most popular jailbreak tweaks of all time, and allows you to animate the Home screen app icons in many ways. It’s one of my all-time favorites, and it works with iOS 9.3.3 without even having needed to be updated. You should definitely consider adding Barrel to your device if you like fun and quirky animations.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CallBar-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* CallBar completely revolutionized the incoming call interface when it was originally launched back in the day, and as iOS has evolved, so has CallBar. The tweak is now compatible with iOS 9.3.3 and allows you to take or decline calls, whether they’re by Phone or FaceTime in a convenient and non-intrusive manner that doesn’t fill the entire screen. It’s still one of my favorites to this day.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Callisto-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Callisto lets you hide the security of your iPhone or iPad in plain sight by letting you use the current time as the passcode to unlock your device. Most people are never going to think to use the time as your passcode because it’s forever changing throughout the day, and a passcode is usually interpreted as a static value that must be the same each and every time. It’s a very clever way to unlock your device and Callisto is compatible with iOS 9.3.3.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CameraTweak-4-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Why ever deal with the features of the stock Camera app in iOS ever again? CameraTweak 4 brings a lot of professional photography and videography features straight to your stock Camera app so you don’t have to install third-party apps from the App Store to get the camera functionality you want. The features are seemingly endless, and we would recommend this tweak to anyone who takes photograph or videography with their iPhone seriously, or even semi-seriously.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CircleIcons-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* CircleIcons is an amazingly simple tweak that makes the icons in the Settings app circular instead of square. The effects of CircleIcons are purely aesthetic, but the effects look more like what you’d see on the Apple Watch, giving the Settings app an improved look and feel with a much more modern appearance. It’s a nice thing to have and works great with iOS 9.3.3
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Eclipse-3-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Dark mode is something that many iOS users wish they had, and with a jailbreak, it’s something you can have. A popular tweak known as Eclipse 3 is fully compatible with iOS 9.3.3 and lets you enable a dark mode throughout any iOS apps that you want to have it in. It also changes the look of the Home screen Dock to look more like the dark mode Dock in OS X.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FaceDown-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* FaceDown is a nice little jailbreak tweak to have because it lets you lock your iPhone by just laying it face down on a table. Such functionality might be useful for snoozing alarms and ending phone calls among other things. When you pick your device up again, the tweak will automatically wake your device up again. FaceDown doesn’t have a huge impact on battery life, so no worries there.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fingal-animations.gif)
* Fingal is a fun add-on for your jailbroken device that animates various app icons on your Home screen. You could call Fingal a theming platform, but it’s more or less just an animation tweak. Fingal is fully compatible with iOS 9.3.3 and we think it adds character to your Home screen. You can also also make or add your own animated themes. I like it, but maybe that’s just me.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/iFile-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* An absolute must-have for any jailbreak of any iOS version is iFile. This is a file browser for your iOS device that lets you go in and modify, add, or delete files from your device’s file system. It’s more of a utility than a tweak, but it works on iOS 9.3.3, and it’s one of my favorite jailbreak extensions of all time.
* If you love playing Pokémon GO, then you absolutely need a way to keep the game from seeing you have a jailbreak, or else it will crash. Masterball is a great jailbreak tweak for doing this because it hides your Pokémon GO app from knowing you’re jailbroken, and hence it will no longer crash when you go to play it.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Masterball-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Update: Masterball is no longer required to run Pokémon GO on a jailbroken device. This post was drafted prior to the update that allowed Pokémon GO to run on jailbroken devices.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/OneHandWizard-Home-screen.png)
* Because Apple’s Reachability feature sucks, OneHandWizard is the ultimate jailbreak tweak in making your larger-screened iPhone easier to use with one hand. It impressively improves the usability of devices like the iPhone 6s Plus, which are difficult to use with one hand. OneHandWizard also has shortcuts for various system functions, which makes it not only easier to control your iOS 9.3.3 device, but easier to configure it and access apps as well.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Power-Tap-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Sometimes you don’t want to slide to power off your device; sometimes you’re more in a slide to respring or slide to reboot mood. Whatever floats your boat, a jailbreak tweak called Power Tap lets you tap on the slide to unlock slider and it changes the slider’s functionality based on what you might need it for. It’s definitely worth checking out in my opinion.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/RecordPause-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* RecordPause is an excellent jailbreak tweak that comes in handy when you use your device all the time for recording video. This tweak lets you tap on the time indicator at the top of the Camera app interface to pause video capture, and you can tap on it again to resume. This lets you keep separate clips in the same media file for your Camera Roll. When paused, the record button and time turn yellow. Check RecordPause out if you haven’t already.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Springtomize-3-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Without a doubt, Springtomize was yet another of Cydia’s game-changing tweaks. It allowed you to customize so much of your iOS device without the need to download so many individual jailbreak tweaks. And now, Springtomize 3 is fully compatible with iOS 9.3.3, which means you can go right back to customizing just about any aspect of your device’s SpringBoard to your own tastes.

* A lot of carriers don’t give you the ability to use your iPhone as a Personal Hotspot because they want you to subscribe to their more expensive data plans, such as those for family sharing. If you’re like me, and you get fed up with these expensive little rules, and want to be able to use your data for whatever you want, then you should have TetherMe, a tweak that enables the native Personal Hotspot feature on your iPhone. It now works with iOS 9.3.3, so enjoy, folks!
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TypeStatus-2-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* One of the nice features about iMessage when compared to SMS is that you can see when other people are typing to you. Unfortunately, if you leave the Messages app, you lose that convenience. TypeStatus 2, which was recently updated for iOS 9.3.3, puts this information in the Status Bar so you can see it from anywhere, and it even shows you the person’s name!
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VolumePanel-iOS-9.3.3.png)
* Since you probably use all of your different iPhone and iPad apps fir different purposes, you may or may not want the volume level to be the same for each. VolumePanel is an add-on for Control Center that lets you control your device’s volume level on a per-app basis. Small vertical sliders make it super easy to configure the volume levels.
* There are certainly many more jailbreak tweaks that are compatible with iOS 9.3.3, and we wish we could cover them all in one post, but Cydia is a vast and ever-expanding.
* Saurik has enabled purchases on the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak, which means you can finally purchase and enjoy paid jailbreak tweaks on the new jailbreak. Don’t be afraid to try new things either; if something doesn’t work right, you can always request an automatic refund within 24 hours.
