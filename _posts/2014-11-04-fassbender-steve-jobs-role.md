* The tumultuous casting process of Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic continues, with Michael Fassbender now reportedly in talks to play the Apple co-founder. Variety reports today that following the departure of Christian Bale, the actor has begun “early talks” with director Danny Boyle and Sony execs.
* Although not as well known as Bale, Fassbender has starred in a number of high profile movies, including Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds and Ridley Scott’s Prometheus. He also received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, for his performance in 12 Years a Slave.
* This is the third actor we’ve seen attached to the Steve Jobs role, following the aforementioned Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio. Seth Rogen’s name has also been tossed around as a potential Steve Wozniak for the film, and word has it that Zero Dark Thirty’s Jessica Chasten is being eyed for a part.
* The movie, which is based on the New York Times Best-Seller Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, is a highly anticipated feature for folks in both Silicon Valley and Hollywood. The script is being penned by Aaron Sorkin, and the film is being directed by Slumdog Millionaire’s Danny Boyle.
* Production was initially expected to begin this winter.
