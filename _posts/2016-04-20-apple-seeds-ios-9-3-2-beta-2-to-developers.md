* Two weeks after Apple released the first beta of iOS 9.3.2 to its registered developers, the company today released iOS 9.3.2 beta 2 to members of the Apple Developer Program. The new beta has a build number and can be applied over-the-air on devices running an iOS 9 beta in Settings → General → Software Update or you can download the full installer from the Apple Developer Center, which requires a paid membership in the Apple Developer Program for full access.
* It doesn’t seem this new build has any new features aside from performance and bug fixes, including a fix for a longstanding Game Center bug. Apple continues to single out Dictionary, iBooks, Safari and Simulator as the focus areas.
* According to reports on Twitter, in iOS 9.3.2 beta 2 it is possible to use Night Shift and Low Power Mode at the same time, which was supported on the initial release of iOS 9.3 before Apple removed this feature in the minor iOS 9.3.1 software update.
* We’ll be updating this post with any new features and enhancements found in iOS 9.3.2 beta 2 as new information becomes available.
