* Apple has issued a special challenge to U.S.-based owners of the Apple Watch on Monday, inviting them to walk, run or wheelchair a workout distance of at least 3.1 miles, or 5 kilometers, this Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, November 24. Those who successfully complete the challenge shall be awarded a special Thanksgiving-themed Activity achievement.
* And to let you brag about your completed challenge and earned achievement, Apple will also unlock a special iMessage sticker which you can send to friends via Messages.

* A similar message appears in the iOS Activity app for those who own the wrist-worn device and are based in the United States:
* Earn this special achievement on Thanksgiving Day, November 24th when you complete a walk, run or wheelchair workout of at least 5K (3.1 mi) in the Apple Watch Workout app, or any app that records these workouts into the iPhone Health app. You’ll also earn a special Messages app sticker!
* Users who accept Apple’s challenge can capture their workouts via the stock Workout app or using any HealthKit-compatible third-party app. If you complete the challenge, a special medal appears on your watch and in the iOS Activity app’s Achievements tab.
* Thanks, Carlos!
