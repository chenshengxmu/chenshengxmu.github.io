* Apple has seeded another beta for OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The update comes just one week after the seventh beta was released, which brought about few notable changes.
* The new build is available to developers via an update in the Mac App Store or as a download on Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s new Beta Seed program yet…
* We’ve seen a number of enhancements in 10.9.3 thus far, including the addition of a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays and the restoration of the ability to sync local contacts and calendar info.
* Today’s build is labeled 13D55, and Apple continues to ask developers to focus on Graphics and Audio Drivers, Mail and Safari. As always, we’ll be sure to let you know if it also adds any new features worth note.
