* With precisely nineteen days until the alleged September 9 iPhone 6 unveiling (notably, Apple hasn’t denied the rumor) and three days after refreshing its Family plans, the nation’s third-largest wireless carrier, Sprint, has introduced a potentially disruptive and new unlimited plan.
* Specifically, the new plan is offering unlimited talk, text and data in exchange for sixty bucks per month. How cool is that?
* Quickly, do the math in your head — that’s $20 less compared to Sprint’s closest competitor T-Mobile. By the way, T-Mobile promptly responded to Sprint’s announcement by promising to treat switchers to a year of free unlimited LTE data.
* Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* According to Sprint’s press release, the plan goes into effect starting Friday, August 22.
* Available to both new and existing individual accounts, it requires eligible users to bring their own smartphone/tablet or buy a new device via Sprint’s Easy Pay program.
* As a reminder, Easy Pay allows customers to split the cost of hardware into monthly installments, similar to T-Mobile’s policy.
* Sprint’s chart sums it up best.

* As you can see, Sprint’s $60 per month is $20 less than the comparable offering of its closest competitor, T-Mobile. On an annualized basis, this translates into a savings of $240 a year over T-Mobile.
* In the meantime, T-Mobile announced earlier today that it will be luring AT&T, Verizon and Sprint castaways with one full year of free unlimited LTE data. All you’re required to do is talk a friend into switching over and each of you will be awarded with free unlimited data on T-Mobile’s fast LTE network, for twelve months.
* And what happens if you’re already on T-Mobile’s unlimited data plan? Simple, you’ll instead receive a $10 per month credit.
* In other Sprint news, the Sprint Spark enhanced LTE service program today launched in 27 markets, offering increased download speeds of 6-15Mbps on compatible devices.
* Also, the Kansas-based carrier said Sharp’s five-inch Aquos smartphone will be arriving exclusively at select Sprint, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile locations.
* And last but not least, as of this Monday businesses can buy Google Apps for Business from Sprint.
* Is Sprint’s $60 pe month unlimited data plan impressive, do you think?
* I for one will be monitoring with great intent how AT&T and Verizon react to Sprint’s announcement because neither offers unlimited data.
