* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Busy Shapes. This means that for the next seven days you can download the hit interactive title for free for both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $3.
* Busy Shapes is an award-winning children’s app that helps kids of all ages improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles. It’s a digital playground of sorts, chock full of positive guidance and motivation.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Slide a shape in the correct hole—easy, right? It is, at first. But what makes Busy Shapes so clever is the way it gently gets more challenging, motivating little kids to find solutions to each puzzle through experimentation. From shape-changing to color-mixing to hidden holes, we’re impressed with how the gameplay spurs out-of-the-box thinking, stimulating curious young minds.
* And here is a clip of the game in action:
* Busy Shapes is available in the App Store for free.
