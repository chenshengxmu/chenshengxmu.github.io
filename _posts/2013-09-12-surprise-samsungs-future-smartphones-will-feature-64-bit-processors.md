* Kim Yoo-chul reporting for the Korea Times:
* The co-CEO implied that upcoming Samsung Galaxy-branded smartphones will be more powerful and faster by confirming that they would have 64-bit processing capability. […]
* “Not in the shortest time. But yes, our next smartphones will have 64-bit processing functionality,” Shin said, adding he followed the media coverage of Apple’s new iPhone.
* Notice the "not in the shortest time." Of course, it will take them a minute to adapt to the new standard Apple just set.
