* NoTodayView is a new free jailbreak tweak for iOS 10 devices that can disable the Spotlight widget page on both the Home screen and Lock screen, which depending on how you use your device, can be very useful.
* While most people like to use the Spotlight and widget page system that comes stock, it gets in the way when you try to use some other Home screen-modifying jailbreak tweaks like Mobius, which allow you to scroll infinitely through all of your Home screen pages and folders without coming to any dead-ends.
* NoTodayView’s goal is to breathe new life into the popular Mobius jailbreak tweak by eliminating the factor that broke Mobius after iOS 10.
* Because the tweak lets you enable or disable the Spotlight widget page from the Home screen and Lock screen individually, you can continue to use the highly-functional page from the Lock screen and still enjoy a Home screen complimented by Mobius.
* It’s also worth noting that the tweak won’t disable the Spotlight widget page from Notification Center, so you’re not 100% locked out from this functionality if you disable it on the Home screen and/or Lock screen, which is kind of nice because sometimes the widgets you might use can be pretty useful.
* To choose where NoTodayView takes action, you can head over to the tweak’s preferences pane in the Settings app after you install it:

* Here, you’ll find individual toggle switches for the Home screen and Lock screen, and the rest is pretty self-explanatory.
* NoTodayView isn’t for everybody, but if you liked Mobius or any other Home screen modification tweak with similar functionality that is broken post-iOS 10, then this tweak is a good way to rejuvenate the jailbreak experience on iOS 10.
* Because NoTodayView requires iOS 10, it’ll only work on devices that have been jailbroken with Luca Todesco’s beta jailbreak for iOS 10.1.1. If you’re already jailbroken, you can check the tweak out, but if you haven’t jailbroken yet, we still recommend holding off until the jailbreak comes out of beta for the sake of keeping your jailbreakable firmware.
* NoTodayView is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and is recommended if you ever want to use Mobius on iOS 10 ever again.
