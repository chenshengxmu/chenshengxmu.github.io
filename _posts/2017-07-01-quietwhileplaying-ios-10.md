* If you have a pet peeve for incoming notifications interrupting your music when you’re trying to sit back and enjoy a song, then installing a new free jailbreak tweak called QuietWhilePlaying (iOS 10) by iOS developer ijapija00 should be next on your to-do list.
* This tweak silences the alert sounds and vibrations associated with incoming notifications, no matter which app they’re coming from, whenever you’re actively listening to media.
* Without the tweak, your music volume would normally be reduced temporarily while the notification sound is played; it would return to its normal level after the sound completes, but what did you miss in the meantime? Was it a lyric? A beat? You won’t know unless you rewind.
* This method is typically acceptable, except for some instances where someone keeps messaging you and won’t leave you alone. When this happens, it can be bothersome, especially when you’re right in the middle of listening to a rad guitar solo and the volume suddenly drops repeatedly.
* After installing the tweak, notification banners will still appear on your display normally, but they’ll so do silently to prevent interruptions to your music playback. This ensures that you hear every beat and rhythm of your music at full volume throughout incoming notifications.
* QuietWhilePlaying (iOS 1o) seems to be the best solution for listening to media throughout the onslaught of continuous notifications, and if you listen to music frequently, then this tweak is probably a worthwhile addition to your device.
* QuietWhilePlaying (iOS 10) is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices. The tweak has no options to configure.
