* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Hyperburner. For the next 7 days you can pick up the hit arcade racer for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $3.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, Hyperburner is a high-speed space flier set in a distant solar system. Players must guide their ships through increasingly dangerous courses, striving for the high score.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* There sure is a lot of debris in space. So if you want to survive as an intergalactic pilot, you’ll need to think fast. Thankfully, dodging and weaving through Hyperburner’s gorgeous levels is pure exhilaration. We love how beating stages “rewards” us with faster ships—it means the better we get, the harder the game gets.
* And here is a clip of the game in action:
* Again, Hyperburner is available in the App Store for free.
