* Contrary to prior rumors, 9to5Mac is reporting that Apple’s long-expected oversized ‘iPad Pro’ will be formally announced at the iPhone 6s press event after all. The event’s been confirmed to take place a week from today, on next Wednesday, September 9, at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
* The publication learned from sources that the forthcoming presentation is set to be one of largest events in Apple’s history. In addition to the iPad Pro and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, it should serve as a launchpad for a fourth-generation iPad mini, a substantially refreshed Apple TV set top box and new Apple Watch Sport bands.
* Citing trusted sources, reported Mark Gurman learned that “Apple is currently planning to debut a pair of new iPads at next week’s event: the long-rumored iPad Pro, and a refreshed version of the iPad mini.”
* The iPad mini 4 will be thinner than its predecessor and powered by a faster A8 chip with support for split-screen apps via iOS 9. “It will likely also include a pair of upgraded cameras,” states Gurman.
* The iPad Pro is “actually the planned name of the device.” Rumored iPad Pro features include a higher-resolution screen measuring 12.2 or 12.9 inches diagonally, support for a Force Touch-based stylus, speakers on two sides for a more pronounced stereo effect and iOS 9.1 software with optimized versions of the Siri and Notification Center interfaces.
* The report goes on to mention that Apple will start taking pre-orders for the iPad Pro toward the end of October before it hits retail outlets in November.
* The massive 7000-seat Bill Graham building was chosen due to the event’s scope, said to include an “unprecedented” blitz of product introductions. New Macs are “unlikely” to appear next week.

* No word on a third-generation iPad Air though.
* Several sketchy reports based on unproven sources have said that the iPad Air 3 may not be announced this year due to engineering issues and production bottlenecks, but their veracity couldn’t be determined.
* For what it’s worth, the publication mentioned that the iPad Air 3 “is also in the works, but sources confirm that it won’t be released until 2016.”
