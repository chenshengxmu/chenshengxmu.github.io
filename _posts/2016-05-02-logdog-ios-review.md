* LogDog, a service originally made popular on the Android platform for keeping your various online accounts safe from unauthorized activity, is now launching for iOS.
* With LogDog, you can actively monitor your online accounts and keep an eye on where the most recent logins came from, what operating system and web browser was used, and more.
* If you’re always worried about your security, or even your privacy, this is an app you’ll want to check out.
* As soon as I learned this service was coming to iOS, I got excited. I’ve had my Facebook account compromised more than once, and I’ve always wanted to be able to monitor where the breaches were coming from. Fortunately, LogDog, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store, provides all this information to you.
* The free version of LogDog supports monitoring your Facebook account, Dropbox account, and Gmail account. Soon, an in-app purchase will be available that lets you unlock additional content in the app.
* Among the various kinds of information you can monitor from the LogDog interface are:
* As you can see from this list, you can keep tabs on quite a bit of useful information types that could not only help you prevent your online accounts from being compromised, but also to potentially find out who was behind the breaching in the first place.
* From the main interface of LogDog, you can see I’ve signed in with my Dropbox, Facebook, and Google account and am allowing the service to monitor them.
* You will be providing LogDog with access to the details on your account for this to work, but your credentials are never stored by LogDog, so your security always comes first. LogDog also will never access more information than it has to – it’s only looking for information related to log in activity so it can show it to you in a convenient interface.

* I’ll show you my Facebook account for example, in the screenshot below. I’ve blurred out or removed some personally identifiable information, such as my email, IP address, and location, but I’ve left the rest of the information for your reference.

* As you can see, my Facebook account was most recently accessed from Firefox on a Mac running OS X El Capitan from a Verizon FiOS IP address, and it shows the date and time it was accessed, as well as the top devices I use to access my Facebook account.
* If at any time there was any suspicious activity, LogDog would tell me under the Alerts banner, but because everything looks kosher, there are no alerts at this point in time.
* You can remove any account you have stored in LogDog from the cog button at the top right of the account interface, or you can add more by tapping on the + button at the top right of the main interface.

* As we noted earlier, LogDog will never store your passwords, and it never accesses your information without your permission. Moreover, you do have the option to remove any account you add at any time.
* LogDog is a well-established service on the Android platform already, so nothing sketchy is going on here, but keep in mind, LogDog does anonymously crowd-source information the same way Apple does, such as online service usage habits.
* None of this information is personally identifiable and will have an impact on your privacy, but it’s something you may want to consider if you were thinking about using LogDog to monitor who’s accessing your online accounts.
* LogDog appears to be a very useful app that lets me keep track of my online accounts and ensure I’m the only one using them. Having been affected by online account hacks in the past, this is a great way for me to monitor where my logins are coming from and cross reference those with my known activity.
* For those that are less tech-savvy and don’t know how to access this information from the services themselves, LogDog is a great way to keep track of everything in one easy-to-follow interface, and I would recommend it to everyone, especially considering it’s free in the App Store.
