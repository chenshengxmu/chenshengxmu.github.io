* As many of us use our iPhones a whole lot more than others do, we find ourselves combating the ongoing issue with conserving battery life, and that’s why Apple introduced a handy little feature known as Low Power Mode.
* Although it’s useful at times, it still requires you to dig through the Settings app to get to it, which is not only cumbersome, but also inconvenient. To fix that problem, a new free jailbreak tweak made especially for iOS 10 called CCLowPower will let you enable Low Power Mode via a new toggle button in Control Center.
* As shown above, the new toggle button appears at the far right of the top of Control Center. It’s the button with what looks like a solid dot in the center.
* When toggled on, the Low Power Mode button appears green, but it appears just like any other disabled toggle button whenever it’s turned off.
* Because launching Control Center requires nothing more than a simple swipe up from the top of your display, it’s far more convenient to use this toggle method rather than having to navigate to Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode (or use the 3D Touch shortcut to it) every time you want to save a little extra juice.
* CCLowPower is a pretty simple tweak and what you see is essentially what you get; there are no confusing settings to configure. After installing it on your device, you’ll see the new toggle button in Control Center immediately and can start using it.
* Because CCLowPower only works for iOS 10, those of you who are jailbroken on iOS 9.3.3 with Pangu are out of luck. The look and feel of Control Center was completely changed in iOS 10, so it wouldn’t be very easy to port to the older operating system in its current form.
* The iOS 10 jailbreak is currently in beta, so we recommend holding off for the time being, but if you’re already jailbroken, it looks like there are a number of awesome tweaks to try on iOS 10 already and several more are still to come.
* You can grab CCLowPower for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. What are your thoughts about CCLowPower? Share in the comments!
