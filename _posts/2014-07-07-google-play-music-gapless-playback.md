* Google’s Play Music client for the iPhone and iPod touch recently picked up some useful new capabilities such as the ability to filter Downloaded Only tracks, edit playlists on the go, Shuffle Artist and more. Today, Google has pushed another update making the application even more useful than before.
* The new Google Play Music version 1.3.0.2190 includes a few bug fixes and improvements, as well as three new features. For starters, you can at last enjoy albums such as Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” precisely the way they were meant to be heard – with gapless playback…
* Next, the app allows you to download whole playlists that you’ve subscribed to, straight to your device for offline listening. Finally, you can now view all of your downloaded music and enjoy improved Listen Now recommendations, with the ability to dismiss them easily.
* The full list of changes includes the following:
* Download Google Play Music free in the App Store.
* iOS 7.0 or later is required. The app still hasn’t exposed its native iPad interface.
