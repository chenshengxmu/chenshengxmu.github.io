* Apple is among a group of tech giants vying for the rights to stream Thursday night NFL games, reports Variety. The NFL said on Monday it has reached a two-year agreement with CBS and NBC for broadcast rights, and it’s been in active discussions with potential partners for digital rights.
* According to Variety’s sources, Apple is among those potential partners, as are Amazon, Google and Verizon Communications. The League is said to be considering a variety of scenarios, including potentially selling the rights to more than one distributor, and mixing in games played overseas.
* Tonight’s report follows a similar one from Reuters in early January, in which the outlet claimed that Apple was in talks with the NFL over the rights to live-stream 3 London games next year. A deal for Thursday night games, however, would be far more significant, given that they’re primetime.
* It’s not hard to imagine why Apple is interested in streaming live NFL games. The company just released a new set-top box and is said to be working on its own over-the-top television service. The average audience for Thursday Night Football games in 2015 was estimated to be 17.6 million viewers.
