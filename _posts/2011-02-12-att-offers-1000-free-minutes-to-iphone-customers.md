* Yesterday AT&T started sending text messages to its iPhone customers, offering them 1,000 bonus rollover minutes. After waiting a few hours for my SMS to come in, I kinda forgot all about it until I saw a tweet from TUAW’s Victor Agreda confirming AT&T’s “gift”.
* Don’t you think AT&T has been very generous lately? First they offered unlimited data to some special customers, then they changed their texting plans to give us more for less, then they gave 20% off iPhone accessories and 2GB of free data to tethering customers, and finally, they are offering free mobile to mobile calling to some of their customers.
* If I didn’t know any better, I’d think that AT&T is trying to prevent us from switching to Verizon…
* Of course they are trying to keep us away from Big Red, and you can’t really blame them for that. The best part of this competition between AT&T and Verizon is that we, customers, end up with more options, usually at a lower price.
* If you haven’t received your text message from AT&T offering you 1,000 minutes, you can enroll simply by texting “Yes” to 11113020. I can confirm it worked!
* So, what do you think about AT&T’s extra kindness towards its customers? Don’t you enjoy the results of this competition between the 2 carriers?
