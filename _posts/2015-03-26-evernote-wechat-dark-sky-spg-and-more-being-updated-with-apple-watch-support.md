* Twitter
* Tweet, Retweet, reply and favorite in a flash. Quickly see recent Tweets and top trends. Share your location, a song, or your thoughts with a flick on the wrist. It’s Twitter, but littler.
* Evernote
* Evernote’s iOS app refresh allows fans of the note-taking software to actually dictate notes into their Watch. Evernote’s WatchKit extensions running on your phone then transcribes your spoken notes and sends them to the service.
* You can also view recent notes, set reminders, find notes made near you and see content related to an upcoming meeting, all from your wrist.
* WeChat

* Redfin
* The real estate app by Redfin makes it easy to find nearby real estate listings, view photos, map their locations, get prices, number of bedrooms, square footage, days on the market and other information, on your Watch. It also supports dictation to record your thoughts and lets you share accounts with family members and even contact a real estate agent to schedule a tour with a tap.
