* Recode reported Sunday that Apple is considering offering a “premium TV bundle” with content from the networks HBO, Showtime and Starz.
* As I’m sure you’ll recall, the Cupertino company’s long been rumored to have been interested in creating a $30-$40 per month skinny bundle of top TV programming from multiple content owners.
* While App Store offers apps from each of those channels individually, Apple has reportedly approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package, as conventional pay TV operators sometimes do.
* Apple currently sells subscriptions to HBO for $15 per month, Showtime for $11 per month and Starz for $9 per month, meaning customers who subscribe to all three channels are looking at a combined monthly subscription fee of at least $35.
* The price Apple might be seeking for the proposed bundle is unknown. A source who spoke to Recode said no deal has been reached as of yet. Notably, Apple doesn’t have a bundle deal in place with any of the premium networks, as per industry sources.
* Unlike traditional pay-TV operators which require you to subscribe to a basic level of TV channels before you can upgrade to a premium bundle, Apple could sell the bundle as a standalone product delivered via iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV.
