* Vimeo, the popular YouTube alternative founded by Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein in November 2004, has an excellent iPhone and iPad app which a year ago received a major makeover and has been the choice of many videographers who demand higher quality with less restrictions than Google’s video sharing service.
* The company today pushed another interesting feature update finally bringing AirDrop video sharing between compatible devices, plus a new Incoming feed. As you could imagine, there are usual bug fixes and performance improvements in this update and a useful option where you can choose to have Vimeo use Wi-Fi or cellular connection when syncing videos…
* Vimeo version 4.0.5 includes a new Incoming feed.
* Basically a social inbox for Vimeo video activity, Incoming is the place where you’ll find everything your contacts have been doing on the service in one continuously updating, well, feed (pictured in the top right screenie).

* Vimeo now supports AirDrop, an Apple technology allowing for easy content sharing between iPhone, iPad and iPod devices running iOS 7. AirDrop is hardware dependent so not all devices support it. The good thing about AirDrop is that it’s a direct device-to-device sharing protocol permitting users to share Vimeo clips without an Internet connection or a local Wi-Fi network.
* In addition to “general memory and performance enhancements” and “Watch Later stability improvements”, Vimeo now includes the Wi-Fi or Cellular option in Sync Settings, which could be very useful if you’re on a metered cellular data plan.
* A month ago, Vimeo brought back the search feature.
* Because Vimeo is also one of the built-in sharing services in OS X Mavericks and iOS 7, you can easily upload your clips to the service from any third-party app which implements the standard Share Sheet.
* Vimeo is available free of charge in the Apple App Store.
* The 11.5MB download runs natively on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 7.
