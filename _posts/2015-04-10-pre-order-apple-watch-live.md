* Heads up everyone, the Apple Watch is now available for pre-order. You can grab yours from either Apple’s online store or the Apple Store app on your iPhone or iPad. Some of us are able to get through, while others aren’t, so be patient. As usual, it seems the Apple Store app is your best bet.
* As a quick reminder, the Apple Watch comes in three models: Sport, Apple Watch and Edition; two sizes: 38mm and 42mm; and with various bands. The Sport is aluminum and starts at $349, the Apple Watch is stainless steel and starts at $549, and the 18K gold Edition starts at $10,000.
* For those still on the fence about pre-ordering the Apple Watch, the following links may prove useful:
* If you do order an Apple Watch tonight, be sure to let us know what model, size and band you decided to go with down in the comments section below!
* Update: as many have noted in the comments, pre-order inventory for many models went very quickly. The 42mm Space Gray Sport model, for example, is showing ‘June’ shipping estimates at just the 30-minute mark. There’s talk that these dates may be a bit off, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.
