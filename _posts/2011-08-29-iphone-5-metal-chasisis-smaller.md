* We’ve already shown you photos of what appears to be the rear plate of a next gen iPhone today, but new claims from infamous industry blog DigiTimes could throw even more confusion onto an already mind-bending situation.
* In a new report, DigiTimes has set about debunking a supposedly leaked video claiming a 4.2″ iPhone 5 is imminent. The problem? The video they’re so upset about was clearly a fake…
* “Despite rumors about iPhone 5 featuring a 4.2-inch panel circulating within the IT market for a while, following a leak from Apple’s website in Switzerland in early August”
* If we disregard the video, DigiTimes’ sources suggest that the iPhone 5 will sport a 3.5-3.7″ screen, “with a design to allow the bezel of the panel to become thinner and make the screen look larger.”
* The most interesting claim is that the new model’s ear plate will be made from a metal construction, which doesn’t entirely jive with our iPhone 5 photos. This may be more evidence that Apple will unveil two new iPhones in the coming weeks, or just that the Cupertino company has been experimenting with different materials.
* If yet more rumors are to be believed, we might not have too long to wait before we find out just what Apple has up its sleeve. A late-September or early-October announcement is becoming increasingly likely, with a release coming a few short weeks after that.
* At this point, it’s becoming so hard to know who to believe that we’re just as confused now as we were a couple of months ago, but the idea of an iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 coming to market in the next few weeks is beginning to make sense, with Apple possibly killing off the iPhone 4 once and for all.
* Given the choice, and depending on specifications, would you rather go for an iPhone 4S or iPhone 5?
