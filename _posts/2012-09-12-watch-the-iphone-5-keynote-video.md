* Although Apple posted an iPhone 5 video earlier today touting all the incredible features of their new smartphone, the company had yet to publish the full keynote video.
* The full video of the keynote is now online for your viewing pleasure. All you have to do is go to Apple’s website, sit back, and enjoy the show….
* Looking the way Apple went about it in the past, it’s safe to assume that the keynote shall soon be available on iTunes and YouTube.
* We’ll keep you posted!
