* The Sn0wBreeze jailbreak tool has been updated to version 2.8b6 with support for iOS 5 Beta 6. This jailbreak is Windows only.
* If you don’t know how to use Sn0wbreeze, check out our tutorial. This jailbreak is mostly tethered, except for the old-bootrom iPhone 3GS. This version of Sn0wBreeze will also let you install the jailbreak on a copy of iOS 5 Beta 6 without a registered UDID.
* As noted in the last version of Sn0wbreeze, you have the ability to install iOS 5 without a developer account. Along with that, the expiration date for iOS 5 Beta 6 has been removed. For users that need to keep their unlock, this version also preserves the baseband.
* Here is the change log for this version of Sn0wbreeze:
* Supported Devices and Tethered?
* iOS 5 Beta 6 has some new changes, and it’s definitely more snappier. iOS 5 is currently a beta, so installing it on a device you use daily wouldn’t be a good idea.
* You can download Sn0wBreeze 2.8b6 from our downloads section. You’ll have to find a copy of iOS 5 Beta 6 on your own.
* Let us know how it went jailbreaking iOS 5 Beta 6 with Sn0wBreeze. Run into any problems?
