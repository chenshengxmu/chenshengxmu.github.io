* Apple’s iPad mini with Retina display is great until the reality hits you in your face with a lofty price tag of four hundred bucks for the entry-level model with just sixteen gigabytes of storage and no cellular connectivity. From time to time, Apple makes good-as-new gear such as iPads and MacBooks available for purchase at reduced prices via the refurbished section of its Online Apple Store.
* And now, for the first time the company’s iPad mini with Retina display is available refurbished, too, starting at $419 for for the Wi-Fi model with 32 gigabytes of storage. That’s sixteen percent off for a cool $80 savings over the list price. The 64GB Wi-Fi refurb costs $509, or $90 less versus standard pricing for brand new models…
* Don’t worry, these are good-as-new devices: Apple always tests and certifies all refurbished products and sells them with its standard 1-year warranty included. All refurbished iPads also include a brand new battery and outer shell as their new counterparts.
* And to give you a piece of mind, Apple is kindly offering free shipping and free returns on all refurbished products.
* “Availability is guaranteed upon receipt of full payment,” notes the firm.
* As of this writing, LTE-capable Retina iPad minis were nowhere to be found on Apple’s official refurbished store.
* The iPad mini with Retina display has the same hardware as its larger sibling, including the A7 processor with the M7 motion coprocessor and the high-resolution 2,048-by-1,536 pixel resolution screen. The only difference between full-size iPad Airs and Retina iPad minis is the display size.
* If you’re interested in refurbished Retina iPad minis, go check out Apple’s Refurbished Online Store now because these things typically sell like hotcake.
