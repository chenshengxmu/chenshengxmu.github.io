* This is probably one of the more intuitive ways to adjust your iPhone’s brightness from anywhere. Swipebright allows you to adjust your device’s brightness by means of a simple swipe of the status bar.
* It may not sound all that exciting, but it’s a fairly convenient tweak to have, and it only costs $0.99 to add it to your jailbroken iPhone.
* Take a gander inside for a full video demo of Swipebright in action…
* The developer could have easily stopped at creating a bare, yet functional tweak, but as you can see from the Settings panel it’s quite robust in features.
* Swipebright can be purchased from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Would you consider using this tweak as a replacement for your current means of adjusting your iDevice’s brightness?
