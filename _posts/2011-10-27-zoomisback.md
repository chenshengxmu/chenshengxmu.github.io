* Missing iOS 4’s double tap to zoom feature? If so, ZoomIsBack! is the jailbreak tweak you’ve been needing.
* As its name not-so-subtly implies, ZoomIsBack! regurgitates the zoom present in iOS 4 — a feature that was ditched in favor of pinch-to-zoom in iOS 5.
* The good news is that once you install ZoomIsBack, both zooming methods work. Check inside for a video walkthrough of the tweak in action…
* ZoomIsBack is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and of course you will need an iOS 5 enabled device to yield any benefits.
* Which zooming method do you prefer; tap-to-zoom, or pinch-to-zoom?
