* In a surprise move today, satellite television provider Dish Network unveiled a brand new smartphone repair service for customers in the United States who can ask for a technician to visit them and fix their iPhone’s screen or battery. The service is called ‘Smart Phone Repair On Your Turf’.
* Dish has deployed its nationwide fleet of technicians who can reach homes or businesses in any of the 50 U.S. states to repair iPhones for consumers whether or not they are Dish customers.
* So, what kind of prices does Dish charge for screen and battery repairs?
* For starters, there’s a minimum $35 “Drive to Me” fee involved which covers a technician coming out to your location. An iPhone  battery replacement commands a $74.99 price tag with a “Drive to Me” fee included.
* Other repair costs depend on the service you need and your iPhone model and can vary between $40 and $190, with a combined cost of a screen and battery replacement on an iPhone 6 Plus as high as $224.98.
* “Instead of paying $650 or more to replace a phone, our technicians step in to extend the life of the phone when a screen shatters or a battery loses its charge,” said Dish.
* They use high-quality replacement parts from “respected third parties”.
* Dish also said that the new service is available for large-scale repairs of enterprise smartphones and employees’ personal devices.
* Dish’s technicians will repair cracked screens and malfunctioning batteries on any iPhone from the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The new four-inch iPhone SE and the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models are not currently supported.
* In the coming months, the company intends to expand the service to include additional devices and smartphone accessories. Dish’s new service is available starting today.
