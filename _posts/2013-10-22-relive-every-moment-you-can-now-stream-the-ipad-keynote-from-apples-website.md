* Apple’s iPad keynote video is now available for streaming straight from its website. It works on mobile or desktop, and through a web browser, but you’ll need the QuickTime plug-in installed in order to enjoy the presentation on beige Windows boxes. If history is an indication, the clip should hit YouTube and iTunes in a couple days tops.
* Until then, block out the next 86 minutes of your life, sit back and relax, grab some popcorn and enjoy as Apple CEO Tim Cook and his sidekicks Phil Schiller (SVP of Worldwide Marketing), Craig Federighi (SVP of Software Engineering) and Eddy Cue (SVP of Internet Software and Services) deliver the latest on the Retina iPad mini, iPad Air, 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros, the next-gen Mac Pro, OS X Mavericks and iLife/iWork…
* The video runs 83 minutes and 47 seconds long.
* To begin streaming, visit the Apple Events web page on your device and choose the October 2013 Apple Special Event thumbnail. As a reminder, streaming quality is dependent on the network conditions, server load, your bandwidth and other factors outside your sphere of influence.
* System requirements include Safari 4 or later on OS X v10.6 or later, Safari on iOS 4.2 or later or QuickTime 7 on Windows. Streaming via the Apple TV requires second or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.
* I’ll be making sure to give you a heads-up once Apple uploads this presentation to YouTube and make it available as a high-definition downloadable iTunes video podcast.
* I’ve also re-encoded the company’s splashy iPad Air promotional video into the YouTube format for easy embedding, give it a watch right here.
