* Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet Software and Services, is reported to have fired Richard Williamson, an executive who oversaw the team that created Apple’s own and troubled iOS 6 mapping service. The development marks the second high-ranked management departure of an Apple executive over so-called Mapgate, following the ouster of iOS boss and Steve Jobs confidant Scott Forstall last month after a CEO apology over the glaring flaws in Apple’s mapping software.
* “We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make maps better”, Cook wrote in lat month’s letter of apology. In an effort to win back trust of its users, Apple is now understood to be seeking outside help to fix Maps. Jump past the fold for the latest info…

* A full report went live shortly after, claiming Apple hasn’t chosen a replacement for the departing executive, indicating the firing may have come abruptly.
* Richard Williamson, who oversaw the mapping team, was fired by Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information wasn’t yet public.
* Cue, who took over last month as part of a management shakeup, is seeking advice from outside mapping-technology experts and prodding digital maps provider TomTom NV to fix landmark and navigation data it shares with Apple.
* A source said that Cue wants to “install a new leadership team” for Apple’s Maps team and firing Williamson is seen as a step in that direction.
* The article mentions Apple is focusing on the most glaring problems most responsible for bad press.
* “The satellite imagery over the U.K. has been improved and labels for popular U.S. landmarks such as the Washington Monument have been corrected”, the article notes.
* As you know, Apple’s boss Tim Cook added Siri and Maps to Cue’s already impressive list of responsibilities that encompass the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore and iCloud.
* “This group has an excellent track record of building and strengthening Apple’s online services to meet and exceed the high expectations of our customers”, Cook said.
* A lengthy profile by Cnet calls Eddy Cue Apple’s Mr. Fixer, indicating he’s the right guy to fix Maps and Siri.
* Somebody fire Eddy Cue

* The iOS 6 Maps apologists are gonna have a lot of on their plate today.
* Here’s my point: Maps is getting better, but it has issues.Bending over to convince yourself they aren’t real is just as flawed.

* This way or another, Cue and Co. seem determined to fix Maps and put the fiasco behind them. It’s gonna be a long road ahead as it took Google Maps seven years to become a reliable service it is today.

* If that means firing more executives who were responsible for Maps woes, so be it.
* Thoughts?
