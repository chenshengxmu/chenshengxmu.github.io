* Coupons.com makes a living from distributing digital coupons, including online printable, social, mobile and loyalty card promotions, in Sunday newspapers. Yesterday, the company rolled out Passbook integration for 20 big-box retailers, allowing you to save a selection of its coupons to your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.
* The system is pretty straightforward. First, you add a coupon to the Passbook via the mobile app or web site. It comes with the expiration date, a scannable barcode and a description of the offer. Cashiers can scan the code or use a numeric code on the back of a Passbook card to process it and apply the offer to your purchase…
* Visiting Coupons.com on your device yields the following message:
* Users of iPhone 5 or iOS 6 simply visit www.coupons.com on their mobile phone, select the Passbook button, and tap Add to Passbook for the coupons they want. Then, just show the offers in Passbook at the cash register for instant discounts.
* At press time, the company’s free iOS app hasn’t yet been updated with Passbook integration.
* TechCrunch reports that a list of participating big-box retailers includes the likes of Macy’s, Old Navy, PETCO, Barnes & Noble, Jo-Anne Fabric, ULTA Beauty, Yankee Candle, Michaels, Sears, Sweet Tomatoes and PetSmart.
* The complete list of supported retailers and brands: Avenue, Barnes & Noble, Bon-Ton, Carter’s, Champion, Gordmans, Harbor Freight Tools, Jo-Ann, Lane Bryant, Macy’s, Michaels, Old Navy, OshKosh B’gosh, PETCO, PetSmart, Shopko, Spirit Halloween, Sweet Tomatoes, ULTA Beauty and Yankee Candle.
* Some of the offers with Passbook integration available right now on Coupons.com include:
* • Old Navy – save $10 off purchase of $50 or more (expires October 24) • Yankee Candle – save $20 off any purchase of $45 or more (expires October 28) • Spirit Halloween – 20 percent off one item (expires October 31) • Jo-Ann Fabric – save 50 percent off one regular price item (expires November 21) • PETCO – free Natural Balance Delectable Delights dog or cat stew (expires November 30) • ULTA Beauty – save $3.50 off purchase $10 or More (expires December 11) • Barnes & Noble – save 20 percent off the list price of one teen book (expires August 31, 2013)
* According to CNET, a pass does not include location information:
* It won’t alert you or automatically pull up once you get close to the store. But, a discount is a discount, and if you have to work a bit more for it by actually unlocking your device and opening Passbook, so be it.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook said yesterday that iOS 6, which has been out for a little longer than a month, has already been installed on more than 200 million iOS devices, nearly half the iOS install base.
* That’s a lot of devices being able to take advantage of Passbook coupons right now.
* And you thought Passbook was a fad…
