* Despite the ongoing legal battles going on around the world between Apple and Samsung, it seems that the firm from Cupertino has decided to stick with the Korean electronics giant for the production of its upcoming A6 chip.
* According to Korea Times’ informers, the chip will be manufactured in Samsung’s plant in Texas…
* “Apple has been in talks with Samsung over shipment of its A6 quad-core mobile processor (AP) chips to be used in the next iPhone. It appears that Apple clearly has concluded that Samsung remains a critical business partner,” an executive from an Apple parts supplier based in Korea said on condition of anonymity.  He said that Samsung has been increasing the output of the Apple-designed A6 chips in its manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas.
* This will help warm up relationships between the two companies? Probably not, but we can always hope.
