* After introducing of the new iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display yesterday, Apple lowered the prices of its refurbished iPads across the board. The entry-level (first-gen) iPad mini, for example is now just $249.
* That’s down $30 from where it was before the new iPad announcements, and $50 less than a new one, which Apple dropped down to $299 yesterday. And don’t worry, Apple has discounted its full-sized tablets as well…
* As noted by MacRumors, Apple’s fourth-generation iPad with Retina display is now available for as low as $379. Again, we’re talking about refurbished units here, and this price is obviously for the 16GB Wi-Fi model.
* At that price you’re looking at a $120 discount. Not bad. And for those wanting a Cellular model, they start at $409, which totals $170 in savings. Apple also has iPad 2s on hand, which start at just $319 for Wi-Fi only.

* If you’re unfamiliar with Apple’s refurbished program, it’s actually quite reputable. The company gives you a brand new shell, and battery, and protects it with the same one-year warranty that it offers on all new devices.
* We realize these are older models, but for folks who don’t care about the latest and greatest, looking to score a solid tablet on the cheap, these are some of the best prices we’ve seen. Act fast, supplies are usually limited.
