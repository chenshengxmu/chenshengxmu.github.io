* If you’re on the lookout for a not-to-be-missed freebie for your iPhone and iPad, look no further than IGN’s latest Free Game of the Month, Radiation Island by Atypical Games.
* This open-world survival adventure game puts you in the shoes of a WWII military scientist who seem to be experiencing some sort of radiation poisoning and must survive on an island inhabited by weird creatures.
* Radiation Island sells for $2.99 in the App Store and has never gone free since its App Store debut this summer. It currently has a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars based on nearly 4,000 App Store reviews.
* The game sports first and third-person perspective modes and is basically like Lost mixed with Minecraft and The Walking Dead.
* “As part of the Philadelphia Experiment you have become stranded in a parallel, alternate reality,” reads the blurb. “Discover this new and mysterious world, with all its surprises. Use everything you find to survive it and solve its puzzle to get back to the real world.”
* In Radiation Island, your main challenge is to survive on an island.
