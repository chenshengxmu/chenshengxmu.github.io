* A quick note to let you know that the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson is now available in the iBookStore for $16.99. The release date was officially scheduled for November, but it was moved ahead when Steve passed away 18 days ago.
* The book is also available right now for Kindle on Amazon. As of tomorrow Monday October, 24th, you’ll also be able to buy this book from your local bookstore…
* If you don’t fell like reading, you can always buy the audiobook for $17.95.
* I originally pre-ordered a copy of the book via Amazon, but I quickly canceled when I found out I would not receive it for another week. Instead, I will go to Barnes & Nobles tomorrow to buy a hard cover copy of the book. I encourage you to do the same.
