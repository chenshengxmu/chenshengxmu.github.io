* It’s been another quiet week for the jailbreak community as we continue on without a fresh jailbreak of any sort.
* Nevertheless, there have been some new jailbreak tweak releases this week that are worth pointing out. In this roundup, we’ll talk about them starting with our favorites and then move on to the rest.

* With NCapps, you get the ability to launch apps right inside of Notification Center.
* There’s finally a great way to get app functionality right inside of Notification Center even when there’s no widget available to the Today tab, and NCapps lets apps run natively at a scaled down size right in Notification Center with the same gestures and buttons you’d use in full-screen mode.
* This is a great tweak from a multitasking perspective, but also lets you access apps quickly when you don’t want to waste time looking for them on your Home screen.
* To learn more about NCapps, you can read our full review.
* iTransmission: A Bittorrent client for iOS (free – review)
* PassConnect: Remembers your login password in the Cisco AnyConnect app for iOS (free)
* This week wasn’t all that impressive for jailbreak tweak releases, but there’s always a chance next week could have something better in store.
* If you’re looking for more jailbreak tweak releases for your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad, you can also read last week’s jailbreak tweaks of the week roundup.
