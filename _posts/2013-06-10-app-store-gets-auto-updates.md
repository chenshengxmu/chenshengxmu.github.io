title: App Store gets auto updates and more in iOS 7
---
* Folks hoping that Apple would make some changes to the dark-themed App Store in iOS 7 will be happy to hear their wish has come true. In line with the rest of the UI design changes in the new software, App Store is now flat, white and easier to read.

* In addition to the makeover, the App Store also receives several enhancements in iOS 7. Perhaps the most compelling change is the fact that users can now opt to have their applications automatically updated. Keep reading for more on the update…
* Apple is adding a new ‘Kids’ section to the App Store, sortable by age, to make it easier for parents to discover new games and applications for their children:

* And Apple has also added a few new (and very handy) location-based app discovery options that will give users recommendations for different apps based on either their location, or what local events they’re attending (for example, a pro sports game or a music concert).
