* Cover Flow is a nice feature, but that’s more due to its visual appeal than actual functionality is concerned. If you hate Cover Flow, then you’ll be happy to know that it can be easily disabled by means of this new jailbreak tweak.
* NoCoverFlow is a tweak from jailbreak developer, Ryan Petrich. With a quick installation, it will easily rid your stock Music app of Cover Flow if you so desire to do so. Take a look at our video walkthrough inside to see NoCoverFlow in action.
* NoCoverFlow is a simple tweak that will allow you to view content in a traditional list view while perusing content in landscape mode. The tweak is a simple install and go, as there or no options or settings to deal with.
* If you’ve been looking for a way to disable CoverFlow on your jailbroken device, then look no further — NoCoverFlow just works. You can find it on Cydia’s BigBoss repo free of charge. Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
