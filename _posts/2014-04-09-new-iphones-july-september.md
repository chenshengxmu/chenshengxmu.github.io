* It used to be that 2014 would see a simultaneous double-iPhone launch until Reuters earlier this week asserted the larger model could get delayed due to production issues with 5.5-inch screens. As a result, only the rumored 4.7-inch model is said to be ready for a launch in September.
* A new report from Japan echoes this notion. Apparently mass production of the 4.7-inch iPhone has been tipped to start in July. As for the 5.5-inch model, the story claims the bigger handset is scheduled to enter full production in September, meaning Apple may not be able to release its phablet before the holiday quarter…
* G for Games passed along a report by Japanese blog EMSOne [Google translate] which cites supply chain sources who claim Tim Cook & Co. will release two new iPhone models at different times this year.
* The EMSOne story is based on a report by the Industrial & Commercial Times, one of Taiwan’s biggest newspapers. Such turn of events is probably unfortunate, but this is business as usual for Apple.
* The company typically employs the waiting tactics until the technology is ready rather than rush out products which aren’t up to its self-imposed standards of quality. When asked about bigger iPhones earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook basically acknowledged this notion.
* What we’ve said is that until the technology is ready, we don’t want to cross that line. That doesn’t say we’ll never do it.
* We want to give our customers what’s right in all respects – not just the size but in the resolution, in the clarity, in the contrast, in the reliability.
* There are many different parameters to measure a display and we care about all those, because we know that’s the window to the software.
* Reuters recently attributed the delayed 5.5-inch iPhone production to unspecified manufacturing difficulties associated with in-cell production technology for the larger screen size.
* Apple first started using in-cell screens for iPhones with the iPhone 5 in 2012.
* Suppliers have recently begun making components for the new iPhones, like Touch ID sensors and chips for liquid-crystal drivers, according to Nikkei.
* Japan Display, Sharp and LG Display have all been reportedly tapped to make the 4.7 and 5.5-inch screens for the new handsets, with Japan Display ostensibly first starting production at its main plant in Mobara, in May, with the others ramping up in June.
