* One of the iPhone models coming in 2019 is said to include a triple camera setup out the back, highlighting the handset’s potential for long-exposure shots and nighttime photography.
* According to a new rumor published Monday by Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, at least one of the iPhones Apple is planning to release in 2019 is thought to come outfitted with a 6P lens featuring 5x zoom without specifying whether it be optical or digital zoom.
* As you know, latest iPhones use a two-lens rear setup for up to 2x optical zoom and up to 5x digital zoom (iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus) or up to 10x digital zoom (iPhone X).
* I’d take this rumor with a grain of salt because the source may have mistaken a three-lens setup for a rear-facing TrueDepth camera system that Bloomberg’s sources recently claimed would come to future iPhone models introduced in 2019.
* Having three lenses versus two would enable the following advantages:
* A 2019 iPhone won’t be the first smartphone with a triple-lens camera setup.

* That honor goes to P20 Pro, Huawei’s 2018 flagship smartphone (pictured above) that features a 20-megapixel f/1.6 monochrome lens, an 8-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto lens and a whopping 40-megapixel f/1.8 RGB main lens for the combined 92 megapixels of image-processing might.
* Here’s South China Morning Post’s hands-on overview of Huawei’s triple-camera technology.
* Having reviewed the new Huawei phone, The Verge’s Vlad Slavov explained that it basically combines all the pixels from the three rear cameras into one ten-megapixel shot with the combined light information from the whole sensor (this is similar to what Nokia previously did with its PureView cameras on the 808 and 1020 phones).
* What do you guys make of this rumor?
