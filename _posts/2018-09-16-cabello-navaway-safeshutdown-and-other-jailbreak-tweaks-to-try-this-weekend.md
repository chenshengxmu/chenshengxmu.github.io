* Having the power to modify your iOS 11 device outside of Apple’s parameters is the primary reason to use the Electra jailbreak. For those that are already using it, finding exciting add-ons to install can be challenging.
* In this roundup, we’ll help you discover new jailbreak tweaks and add-ons for your handset by consolidating all the previous week’s releases into one post. This roundup will encompass all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from September 10th to September 16th.

* Cabello is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you tweak the behavior of your handset’s physical buttons with custom sounds and haptic feedback.
* Out of the box, Cabello brings a myriad of different sounds to the table, and future updates will add even more. The tweak’s haptic feedback works on iPhone 6s and newer.

* NavAway is a sleek new jailbreak tweak that intelligently hides the navigation bar in relation to the direction you scroll inside of apps.
* In addition to providing a full-screen experience in almost any app you choose, the tweak offers an aesthetically-pleasing transition from seeing the navigation bar to not seeing the navigation bar.
* You can learn more about NavAway and why it’s such a great add-on for your jailbroken device in our full review.

* There’s nothing worse than being without your semi-untethered jailbreak all because your iPhone ran out of battery. Fortunately, a new jailbreak tweak called SafeShutdown prevents this from happening.
* SafeShutdown kicks your handset into an ultra-low power mode when your device reaches a specific percentage. When this happens, the device becomes unresponsive to conserve as much battery as possible, similarly to as if your device had shut down from a dead battery. After your device is charged back up, SafeShutdown releases its clutch on your device, allowing you to use it again.
