* Apple’s next flagship handset, dubbed by many to be the iPhone 7, will ship with standard 3.5mm EarPods and an adapter for the Lightning port, reports Mac Otakara. Of course, the device is widely rumored to be shipping without a headphone jack.
* Should the rumors materialize, a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter would allow users to connect any standard-jack headphones to the new iPhone. Such a move may help appease customers who are expected to be disappointed about the hardware change.
* At Computex Taipei 2016, many manufacturers showcased their new Lightning audio adaptors, and it seems there has been rumors that the EarPods with Remote and Mic to be included with the new iPhone 7 series will still come with its own headphone jack as usual, and that a Lightning headphone jack adaptor will also be included in the package. 
* The site goes on to reaffirm rumors that the iPhone 7 will feature two speakers, one on each side of the Lightning port, set up in a monaural system. It also notes that a 256GB model is expected. Mac Otakara has a fairly accurate record in Apple intel.
* In addition to no headphone jack and dual speakers, the iPhone 7 is also believed to sport an improved camera with dual lenses (on the larger ‘Plus’ model), a touch-sensitive Home button and dual SIM. The handset should land sometime in the fall.
