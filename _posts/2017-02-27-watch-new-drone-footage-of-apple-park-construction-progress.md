* Drone pilot and YouTuber Matthew Roberts today published a new 4K drone footage of Apple’s upcoming 175-acre campus, officially named Apple Park, which will open doors to employees in April. Recorded using a DJI Phantom 3 Professional, the crisp 4K footage provides a breathtaking birds-eye tour of Apple’s particle accelerator—that is, mega headquarters. Watch the video and let us know what you think of the progress being made at the site.
* The video shows that the solar panels on the main ring-shaped building are still being added while the ones on the rooftops of vehicle garages seem to have been completely installed now.
* Additional trees have been planted on the site, including drought-resistant trees in the center of the main building. Landscaping work at the maintenance facility has now started, too, and the secure research and development facility is “as polished as ever”.
* Here’s the video.
* When finished, Apple Park will provide two miles of walkways for employees.
* How do you like the new iSpaceship drone video?
