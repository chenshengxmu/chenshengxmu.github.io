* Apple has boosted its Affiliate Program that enables website owners to earn commissions on qualifying iTunes sales. Now, the iPhone maker is inviting developers to join the party.
* According to an email communique the Cupertino company sent out to the registered iOS developers, makers of iPhone and iPad applications can now earn commissions, too, by promoting paid music, apps, books and other items via iTunes, App Store, iBooks and the Mac App Store affiliate links provided within their apps through the iOS Store Kit Share Sheet.
* Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* According to Apple’s email to developers (thanks, Carlos!), the Store Kit Product Sheet is now affiliate commissionable on iOS 8.
* The Store Kit, which made its debut in iOS 6, allows an iOS app to bring up a handy description for any iTunes item — be it an app, a movie or an electronic book — in a nicely done overlay, without yanking users out of the app.
* From Appe’s email:
* Store Kit Product Sheet allows app developers to promote the purchase of music, apps, books and more directly from a sheet within your app and earn the standard affiliate commission on all sales within 24 hours.
* The Store Kit lets users, say, check out an app and even buy it, all without leaving the currently running app.
* Apple is urging developers to implement the Store Kit Product Sheet in order to provide ”a superior user experience and keep users in your app longer”.
* To learn how to integrate your own affiliate token into the Store Kit Product Sheet, check out Apple’s Developer Documentation.
* The Apple Affiliate Program micro-site offers additional information related to getting your own affiliate link, including availability by country, a FAQ, information pertaining to linking and other tools such as Link Maker, Auto Link Maker, Widget Builder, Banner Builder, RSS Feed Generator and advanced tools like the Search API and Collection Builder, which allows programmers to build dynamic playlists inside the store.
* Disclosure: our own articles make use of affiliate iTunes links.
* When you click/tap these links and buy a linked app, movie or other iTunes content, iDownloadBlog earns a tiny commission.
