* Apple during last night’s Grammy Awards ceremony aired a trailer for its upcoming Carpool Karaoke spinoff, saying it’s coming soon without committing to a specific air date for the show. It will be exclusively distributed to Apple Music members.
* The show will feature unlikely celebrity pairings, like Metallica and game show host Billy Eichner or wrestler John Cena and cager Shaquile O’Neal.
* Based on the segment on “The Late Late Show” with James Corden that’s become a viral video sensation, Apple’s spinoff features sixteen celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don’t expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over.
* The show will feature James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal and other celebrities.
* Carpool Karaoke will have a different host every episode.
* The series is being produced by CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73, with James Corden and Ben Winston serving as co-creators and executive producers along with executive producer and showrunner Eric Pankowski.
* “We love music, and Carpool Karaoke celebrates it in a fun and unique way that is a hit with audiences of all ages,” Apple’s Senior Vice President Eddy Cue said recently.
* “It’s a perfect fit for Apple Music.”
* The new series is coming soon, only on Apple Music.
