* When will the white iPhone 4 be available? That’s the eternal question that hopefully will get an answer sooner rather than later. Maybe even sooner than we thought. If you go to Vodafone UK’s website right now, you can see an iPhone 4 in white color labeled as “coming soon”.
* So what is this? A marketing stunt from Vodafone to get a little attention, or a clear sign that the unicorn white iPhone 4 is right around the corner? Your guess is as good as mine…
* So what do you think?
