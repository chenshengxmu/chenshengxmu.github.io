* If you’re a fan of the JellyLock jailbreak tweak, which brings an Android inspired Lock screen launcher to then iPhone, then boy, do I have a tweak for you. JellyLockClock7 is a brand new jailbreak tweak that’s currently in beta, and it allows you to compliment your Android inspired Lock screen launcher with an Android inspired Lock screen clock.
* As someone who’s a big fan of JellyLock, I have to say that this is the perfect compliment tweak. We’ve got more details, a video, and the download information inside.
* First and foremost, you’ll need to add developer @magn2o’s repo to your list of Cydia sources in order to download JellyLockClock7 for free. His repo address is as follows: http://repo.fortysixandtwo.com

* Once you have the repo added to Cydia, search for JellyLockClock7 and install it. After installation, venture into the stock Settings app, where you’ll find a preference panel for the tweak.

* The tweak’s preferences allow you to customize the time delimiter, and the style of the time and date assets. For instance,  you can change the text style, make the text bold, or add upper or lowercasing.

* Of course, I think the tweak looks best and most like Android using its default settings. If that’s your primary concern, just make sure that the kill switch is disabled in the tweak’s preferences, and be done with it.
* JellyLockClock7 is still technically in beta, and not yet available on Cydia’s default repos. Even still, I find that the tweak runs decently on my iPhone 5s, and as you can see from the screenshots and video I’ve included, it goes perfect with JellyLock.
* What do you think?
