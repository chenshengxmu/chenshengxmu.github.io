* Last December, a Turkish website claimed Tim Cook would travel to Turkey to met with President Abdullah Gül to discuss a potential multi-billion dollar iPad deal in education. It would be worth up to $4 billion and would entail an order for fifteen million tablets over the next three years, the story went.
* This bold educational project known as FATIH, would put tablets in over 40,000 Turkish schools, representing a major win for Apple and education. The government of Turkey, home to 74 million people, has now confirmed that the meeting will take place later today…
* As first noted by 9to5Mac, a Presidental schedule posted on the government’s website reveals that Tim Cook is scheduled for a chit-chat with the Turkish President Abdullah Gül at 11:00am local time today. The timing of the meeting would precede grand opening of Apple’s rumored first retail store in Turkey.

* The iPad deal between Apple of California and Turkish government has been in the making for quite a few months now. At first, the government would not commit to Apple before exploring potential deals with other tablet vendors.
* It would seem now that Tim Cook & Co. were able to outclass their competitors with a more complete package. Aside from the actual hardware, Apple’s offer for educational institutions typically includes support and standard services such as curriculum and network upgrades.
* Speaking of education, the company has also won a contract to deploy iPads to 38 Los Angeles campuses ahead of state tests in the spring.
