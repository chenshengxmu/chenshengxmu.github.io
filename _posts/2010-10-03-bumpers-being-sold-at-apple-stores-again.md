* I know when Apple announced that they would be handing out free bumpers to anyone who bought an iPhone 4 that the masses would be up in arms over the possibility of Apple deciding to discontinue the case. It wouldn’t shock this bruised up author a bit if it came out someday that the cases were made strictly as a bandaid to be given out for the antenna issue.
* 9 to 5 Mac is reporting that the beloved protective measure is currently being sold at Apple stores. Apple just recently stopped their free case giveaway on September 30th as planned and now plans to turn a profit off of all those pesky freebies…
* The one worthy part of this is those who *gasp* ever thought of putting a different color than black on their phone should be able to purchase the variety of colors Apple is offering. I can say that my $3 knockoff bumper off eBay protected well against a dreaded phone drop, so the $29 Apple is still charging is worth it, right?
* How many of these things will Apple sell? I do think they are one of the sleekest cases out for the iPhone 4. But are there people really assuming the case as a necessary accessory to avoid antenna issues? Let us know if you plan to buy a colorful bumper.
