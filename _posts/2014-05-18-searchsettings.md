title: How to easily search the contents of the stock Settings app

* As a recent Galaxy S5 adopter, one of the features that I immediately appreciated was the ability to perform a search within the phone’s Settings. Granted, Samsung is notorious for packing its phones with so many settings that a search is almost a requirement, but it’s still a nice feature to have.
* Needless to say, ever since I laid my hands on the GS5, I’ve been wanting for a similar feature on iOS. Well, that feature arrived just a few minutes ago, and it’s, unsurprisingly, brought to us by the prolific developer Ryan Petrich.
* SearchSettings is a new jailbreak tweak available on Ryan’s beta repo, and like on the GS5, you can perform searches within the settings app. Have a look at our video demo of the tweak in action after the fold.
* Once SearchSettings is installed, you can venture to the stock Settings app, locate the search bar at the top of the interface, and just start searching for items within the Settings. Searches are quick, and allow you to interact with the search results to quickly navigate through the settings.
* The only downside to SearchSettings is that there’s no option to search within all available fields at every hierarchical level within the settings. Searches are only performed within the current hierarchy, so you can’t, for example, search for Siri’s settings if you’re at the very top level of the Settings app. You’d need to first go into the General tab to successfully search for the Siri panel.
* I’m sure there are reasons (probably speed) why SearchSettings doesn’t allow for deep searching within the Settings app, or perhaps Ryan is just waiting to implement the ability on a future update (remember this is beta). Regardless of the reason, I’m just happy to finally have the ability to search within the Settings app on some level, even if it’s not as deep as it is on Samsung’s flagship smartphone.

* What do you think about SearchSettings?
