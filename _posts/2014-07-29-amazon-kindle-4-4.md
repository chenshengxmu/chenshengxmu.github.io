* Hot on the heels of announcing a standalone all-you-can-eat subscription for books and audiobooks costing ten bucks per month, the online retail behemoth Amazon has issued an interesting update to its free Kindle for iOS app.
* In addressing customer complaints, the company has brought out several new features that make sync and navigation easier. For starters, Kindle 4.4 lets you create placeholders to explore other areas of the book without losing your current place.
* I’m exited about Wikipedia integration: you can now easily learn more about a word by selecting it to read an entry from Wikipedia in the Info Card at the bottom of the page…
* And, students will love the ability to export their notes, highlights and other items from “Print Replica” textbooks via email.
* Kindle 4.4 for iOS changelog:
* Download Kindle free in the App Store.
* The 58.4MB universal app requires iOS 6.0 or later.
