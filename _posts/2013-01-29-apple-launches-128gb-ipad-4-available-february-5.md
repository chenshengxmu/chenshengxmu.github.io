* Just days after a new ‘Ultimate’ iPad SKU was discovered in iOS code strings, Apple on Tuesday launched the rumored 128GB fourth-generation iPad with Retina display. Corroborating retail sources, Apple said that the new storage option carries a $100 premium over the 64GB full-size iPad, which starts at $699 for the Wi-Fi-only version. In other words, a 128GB Wi-Fi-only iPad 4 will set you back $799, or $929 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. Both are available in black or white starting Tuesday, February 5, via Apple’s online and brick-and-mortar stores as well as through select Apple Authorized Resellers…
* I love Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller’s comment in a media release that pitches the iPad as a replacement for your “old PC” (emphasis mine):
* With more than 120 million iPads sold, it’s clear that customers around the world love their iPads, and everyday they are finding more great reasons to work, learn and play on their iPads rather than their old PCs.
* With twice the storage capacity and an unparalleled selection of over 300,000 native iPad apps, enterprises, educators and artists have even more reasons to use iPad for all their business and personal needs.
* The tablet comes preloaded with iOS 6.1 that launched yesterday as a free software update for existing iDevices.
* Apple also reiterated how virtually all of the Fortune 500 and over 85 percent of the Global 500 corporations are currently deploying or testing iPad.
* We also learned that Apple now has over ten million iWork users, 800,000 App Store apps, of which more than 300,000 apps are designed specifically for the iPad, more than 5,000 newspapers and magazines in Newsstand and north of 1.5 million books on the iBookstore.
