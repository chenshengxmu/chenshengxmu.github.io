* Dropbox posted an update to its iOS client this afternoon, bringing the app to version 3.1. The update features a number of improvements, such as new illustrations, several bug fixes, and some SSO enhancements for Dropbox for Business users.
* Users will be happy to hear that a few major bugs have been addressed in version 3.1 including the sync issue that would often cause some photos to fail to load, and the sorting problem that wouldn’t group items properly when you sorted by date…
* Here’s the full change log for 3.1:
* What’s New in Version 3.1
* • Updated illustrations • Improved SSO for Dropbox for Business users  • Fixed an issue where some photos would fail to load • Fixed an issue where sorting by date wouldn’t group items properly • More bug fixes and improvements 
* Last week, Google put some serious pressure on Dropbox and other cloud services by announcing some drastic price cuts for Drive. Where Dropbox charges $10 per month for a 100GB plan, Drive now costs just $1.99—$10 on Drive actually gets you 1TB.
* Dropbox is still leading the pack however, in terms of consumer cloud services, thanks in part to its well-designed, easy to use Mac OS X and iOS apps. If you don’t have it yet, you can find the Dropbox app for the iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free.
