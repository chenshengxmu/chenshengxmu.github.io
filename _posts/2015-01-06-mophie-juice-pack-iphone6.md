* Renowned accessory maker Mophie is out of the gate with the first ‘Made for iPhone’ licensed battery cases for Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Their new Juice Pack protective battery cases promise to boost the run time of your iPhone 6 by 120 percent, or up to sixty percent in the case of the larger iPhone 6 Plus which already packs a notably stronger battery than its 4.7-inch sibling.
* The California-based company said the new cases for Apple’s last handsets are now available for pre-order.
* Juice Packs incorporate edge-to-edge protection, rubberized support points on the inside to protect the handset from drops and falls, quick-charge and pass-through technology to charge and sync the phone simultaneously at a rapid rate, as well as forward-ported speakers.
* When connected to a computer, your iPhone 6 recharges first, and then the Juice Pack case recharges itself.
* As an added bonus, the integrated standby switch lets you choose when to charge or save some juice for when you need it most and of course there’s the LED power indicator to indicate the battery levels and charge status.

* Depending on the model, these new cases provide up to 17 more hours of talk time, up to 12 more hours of web browsing, up to 13 more hours of video playback and up to 60 more hours of music playback, said Mophie.
* Each Juice Pack ships with a micro-USB cable for charging and a headphone jack extender. Appropriate docks and clips will be announced at a later stage.

* An updated version of its predecessor, the $99.95 Juice Pack Air for iPhone 6 features a built-in 2750mAh battery for up to a 100 percent longer run time.
* The $119.95 Juice Pack Plus for iPhone 6 features a stronger 3300mAh battery for a 120 percent longer run time, in exchange for a slightly bulkier appearance compared to the Juice Pack Air.
* Lastly, the $99.95 Juice Pack for iPhone 6 Plus includes a 2600mAh battery, enough to boost the phone’s already strong battery by as much as an additional 60 percent.
* Color-matched to fit your Space Gray, Gold or Silver device, the new Juice Packs are available in Black, White and Gold finishes and can be pre-ordered now through the Mophie webstore, with 3-4 weeks shipping.
