* Apple is preparing to launch a new 4-inch iPhone this spring, reports 9to5Mac. The oft-accurate Mark Gurman claims he has it on good authority that the device, codenamed N69, will publicly be called the “iPhone 5se,” and should begin shipping by March or April.
* Gurman says the device that made headlines yesterday, which looked identical in design to Apple’s current smartphones, is a fake, and the real 4-inch iPhone looks a lot like the iPhone 5s. He also notes that contrary to recent rumors, the handset has a headphone jack.
* The new device is internally codenamed “N69,” but the launch name will likely be the “iPhone 5se.” The “se” suffix has been described in two ways by Apple employees: as a “special edition” variation of the vintage 4-inch iPhone screen size and as an “enhanced” version of the iPhone 5s. Indeed, the upcoming “5se” features a design similar to 2013’s flagship but upgraded internals, software, and hardware features that blend the old design with modern technologies from the past two iPhone upgrades.
* As for that hardware, he believes the 5se will feature an 8-megapixel iSight camera, 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera, and the A8 and M8 chips from the iPhone 6. And although its screen won’t be pressure-sensitive, he has heard that the phone will support Live Photos.
* It’s believed that Apple is planning an event for March, similar in date to its keynote last year, to introduce this new iPhone, as well as new Apple Watch hardware—although a recent report pointed to supply chain evidence that suggested it may not be a major refresh.
