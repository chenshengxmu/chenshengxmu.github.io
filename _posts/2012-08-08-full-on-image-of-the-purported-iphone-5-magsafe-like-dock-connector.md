* Both big media and bloggers agree that with the next iPhone release come this September, Apple is going to debut a brand new dock connector to replace the aging 30-pin thing present on existing devices. The company will allegedly deploy the new dock connector across all future iOS devices.
* Built with space in mind, the new connector was originally said to have 19 pins or fewer. A new report surfaced today sporting a crisp shot of the new dock connector with a metal ring inside the casing cutout, suggesting an exciting possibility: that the cable could attach magnetically, just like the MagSafe connector for Apple’s notebooks…
* NowhereElse, a French blog, has the story (human-translated from French):
* One of the two other pictures we were sent in high resolution shows us that the new dock connector that should be on the iPhone 5 seems even smaller than what we thought, even tiny compared with the current dock connector.
* This shot is the first to show a metal ring around the connecting dock integrated to the frame of the phone […]. Does this confirm the MagSafe dock connector?
* The big question pertains to the number of pins this purported connector might have.
* It was first reported that the new dock connector will carry 19 pins inside it, but that may not be the case after all.
* iLounge was first to claim that Apple’s smaller dock connector may have fewer pins than originally thought. 9to5Mac followed up, digging through the fourth beta of iOS 6 to discover “9Pin” mentions that suggest something along the lines of a 9-pin connector.
* What do you guys think, how many pins will the new connector have?
* And is Apple going to market it as MagSafe?
