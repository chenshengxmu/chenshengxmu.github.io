It has become one of the most popular searched products on BestBuy.ca,” said Tony Sandhu, Senior Vice President of Merchandising at Best Buy Canada. “We’re excited to bring the highly coveted Apple Watch to more Canadian consumers, especially with the holidays coming up.”
* The publication was also able to obtain the confirmation statement from an Apple spokesperson, saying that “Customers love Apple Watch, and we are thrilled to begin offering it at Best Buy locations across Canada starting August 14.”
* According to Apple itself, “More than 50 Best Buy stores will carry Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models in time for the holiday shopping season.”

* For the time being, Best Buy won’t be carrying 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition models.
