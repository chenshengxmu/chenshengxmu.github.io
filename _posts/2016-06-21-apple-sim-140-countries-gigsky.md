* GigSky, a mobile technology company offering a global mobile data service and an important Apple SIM partner, announced on Tuesday a major service expansion making the Apple SIM available this summer in more than 140 countries worldwide, up from more than 90 countries and territories.
* The company will offer cellular data plans for iPad travelers with the Apple SIM in any supported country. For details on enhanced coverage and pricing, check out the GigSky website.
* The newly added markets include top travel destinations and countries like Ecuador, Argentina, Jamaica, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Isle of Man and The Virgin Islands.
* “We’re thrilled to be adding more countries, more LTE coverage and more data at the same price,” said GigSky CEO, Ravi Rishy-Maharaj.
* Today’s announcement should be of particular importance to world travelers who own a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which features an embedded Apple SIM, avoiding the hassle of buying a local SIM when they roam the world.
* Of course, customers are free to purchase GigSky international data plans on other devices that support the Apple SIM, like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 and iPad mini 3. The GigSky service is separately available on other iOS devices via the GigSky SIM and app.
