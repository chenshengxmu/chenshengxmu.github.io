* German magazine Curved.de recently published an interesting mockup which envisions an iPad Pro dock with vintage Macintosh look complete with a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Released in the early 1990s, the Macintosh LC (“LC” stood for “low-cost color”) was the company’s low-end, inexpensive Mac which due to its Apple II compatibility was adopted primarily in the education and home markets.
* “For such a concept to prove beneficial, Apple would have to implement a modified version of its desktop operating system OS X on its Pro iPads,” writes the magazine.
* “The LC series sold well and was coined ‘pizza box’ by fans. With its initial sixteen-megahertz processor and ten megabytes of RAM, the computer definitely proved to be competitive,” writes the magazine.

* Fast forward sixteen years later and we now have a personal computer with a 2.26-gigabherz dual-core chip with four gigabytes of RAM packed inside the iPad Pro’s thin and portable form factor.

* Curved’s concept would make the iPad Pro even more useable as a professional graphics tablet, combining the Mac’s two USB ports and an SD card reader to the iPad Pro’s internal Flash-based storage and its powerful CPU/GPU.

* The Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse would connect to the Mac via Bluetooth while an iPad Pro connection would be realized via the Smart Connector.
* At the end of the day, it’s only a concept but one that does a terrific job of imagining how cool disguising a cutting-edge computer in retro look would be.
