* As first noted by Jim Dalrymple of The Loop, Apple has added Kendrick Lamar to its star list of performers at the upcoming iTunes Festival SXSW next month in Austin, Texas.
* Support acts ScHoolboy Q, Isaiah Rashad, Band of Skulls and Capital Cities have also been added to the list of performers.
* Lamar, 26, is a popular American hip-hop artist who first gained major attention in 2010, after the release of his fourth mixtape, ‘Overly Dedicated’.
* The Los Angeles based lyricist also delivered a flawless set during last year’s iTunes Festival at London’s historic Roundhouse venue, where more than 400 artists performed in front of more than 430,000 fans, according to MTV…
* For the first time ever, this year’s iTunes Festival will be held in the United States, Apple announced earlier this month.
* “We’re excited about the incredible lineup of artists performing and SXSW is the perfect place to debut the first iTunes Festival in the US,” Apple’s Eddy Cue said.
* The music event runs March 11-15, 2014 at ACL Live at the Moody Theater, the home of Austin City Limits. Some of the confirmed acts include Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Pitbull, Keith Urban and ZEDD, with “more to come”.
* Just yesterday, Apple confirmed that the popular Seattle, Washington rock band Soundgarden will be performing live at iTunes Festival SXSW, marking the 20th anniversary of one of the band’s best albums, ‘Superunknown’.
* The legendary Willie Nelson was previously added to iTunes Festival SXSW.
* All five nights of the show will be available live and on-demand for streaming via the iTunes Store on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac/PC devices, with high-definition streaming available through the iTunes Festival app on iOS devices and the Apple TV.
