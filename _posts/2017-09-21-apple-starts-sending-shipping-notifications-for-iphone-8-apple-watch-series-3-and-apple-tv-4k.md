* If you were worried you hadn’t received a notification from Apple yet for your iPhone 8, Apple Watch Series 3, or Apple TV 4K order, you may relax as the company has just started sending them out.
* Several iDB readers from the US, and myself from France have indeed received shipping notifications under a combination of email, push notification, or just good old SMS.
* If you haven’t received your notification quite yet, and your order notes you should receive your product on September 22, don’t stress out just yet as you will probably receive that notification in the next few hours. Historically, Apple has been extremely accurate in its shipping promises, so I wouldn’t worry too much if I were you.
* If you haven’t ordered a new iPhone 8, or Apple Watch, or Apple TV 4K, your chances of being able to score one in store on Friday is pretty good as it seems Apple has plenty of inventory for these devices.
* Have you received your notification yet? Excited?
