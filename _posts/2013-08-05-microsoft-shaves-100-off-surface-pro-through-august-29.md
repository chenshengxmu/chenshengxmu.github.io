* In another sign that Microsoft’s Surface tablets are failing to hit the ground running, the Windows giant has slashed the Surface Pro lineup by $100 through August 29. The Microsoft-branded tablet family was unveiled last October so it’s only logical the company now wants to get rid of unsold inventory as it gears up to announce a second-generation Surface later this year. Both the 64GB and 128GB flavors of the Surface Pro are now a $799 and $899 value, respectively…
* According to The Verge, the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are now showing price cuts on both Surface Pro models. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that customers in these countries can buy a $100 cheaper Surface Pro between August 4 and August 29.
* Of course, Microsoft put its expected spin on the development:
* We’ve been seeing great worldwide success with Surface RT pricing and keyboard-cover promotions over the past several months and are proud to offer Surface Pro at more affordable prices starting today.
* The cheaper Surface RT is based on ARM architecture while the Surface RT runs Intel chips, allowing it to run legacy Windows programs and be marketed as a cross-over between a tablet and a notebook.
* The official Surface website is advertising the price cut.

* The news arrives following Microsoft’s unexpected deep 30 percent discount on Surface RT tablets after Geekwire estimated the Windows maker sold a mere 1.7 million Surface RT units to date, prompting a massive $900 million write-off over unsold inventory.
* According to its annual Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Surface family of tablets had raked in only $853 million in revenue for the company.

* Even the outspoken Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer couldn’t spin the news in a positive direction and has reportedly told troops that “we built a few more devices than we could sell”. Despite this unusual admission of failure, I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that iPad-bashing in Surface commercials will continue unabated.
