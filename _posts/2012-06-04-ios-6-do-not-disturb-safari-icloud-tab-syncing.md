* iOS 6, the next major release of Apple’s mobile operating system slated for unveiling at the WWDC keynote next Monday, will likely bring a few new features already present in the latest build of OS X Mountain Lion.
* My personal favorite: The new Do Not Disturb mode in Notification Center that should at least help alleviate that iMessage alert conundrum…
* Mark Gurman over at 9to5Mac relays what trusted sources told him, that iOS 6 will include iCloud Tabs support, Mail VIPs and a handy Notification Center enhancement.
* As for the Do Not Disturb option, Gurman explains:
* Sources say, that while the option is present directly in the Mountain Lion Notification Center, the Do Not Disturb toggle is stationed like the Airplane Mode button in settings.
* The mockup below depicts this toggle.
* iCloud Tabs, as the name suggests, will automatically synchronize open tabs across iOS devices and Macs, accessible via the iCloud Tabs button hidden behind the Bookmarks toolbar on an iOS 6 device.
* When the iCloud Tabs button is clicked on an iOS 6 device (or Mac), all the tabs opened on each device are simply shown in a synchronized list. From here, users can quickly pickup individual tabs that they were working on across their Apple devices.
* Here’s the new iCloud Tabs button in desktop Safari.

* Mail VIPs is a new feature Apple announced in OS X Mountain Lion that works in a manner similar to Gmail’s Priority Inbox in that it automatically collects your important email messages.
* Mountain Lion’s implementation checks incoming email against a dedicated list of VIP recipients (for example, your boss and co-workers, family members and so forth).
* VIPs assigned to iCloud accounts will sync with iCloud across iOS 6 iPads, iPhones, iPod touches, and OS X Mountain Lion Macs.
* Given how Apple’s been working to make the next versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems work coherently, I think we’re likely to see those capabilities in iOS 6.
* I really like this feature parity. It’s not aimed at us geeks, granted, but imagine
* iOS 6 will allegedly enable Siri on the iPad 3 and Siri support in third-party apps, also bringing out system-wide Facebook integration while carrying over certain new features from OS X Mountain Lion. Major enhancements to stock apps are to be expected across the board, including breathtaking 3D view in the revamped Maps app that uses Apple’s own tiles.
* What do you think of Do Not Disturb, iCloud Tabs and VIP mail recipients in iOS 6?
