* Apple took the wraps off its promised new Battery Health capability in beta 2 of iOS 11.3. This new feature lets select iPhone users see the health of their battery, as well as disable Apple’s performance management features (read: CPU throttling) if they so choose.
* The new section can be found under Settings → Battery → Battery Health (Beta). Since the new feature is still available only in beta form, watch our hands-on video to check it out.

* The performance-smoothing feature is off by default, but will activate once your phone starts experiencing unexpected shutdowns because of an excessive draw on a worn-out battery.
* Once it’s triggered, you can go in and tap on a (tiny) Disable button in the Settings app. This will keep your phone operating at full speed, but at the risk of unexpectedly shutting down.
* What do you make of Apple’s battery management feature?
* Do you plan to use it?
* Let us know down in the comments.
