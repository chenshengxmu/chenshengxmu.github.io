* Unveiled in October, Google announced Monday that its Home Max wireless speaker with built-in Assistant is now available in the US from electronics retailer Best Buy, carrier Verizon., retailer Walmart and Google’s own webstore.
* Best Buy is accepting Google Home Max orders with an optional next-day delivery option for those who’d like to buy one now and have it delivered tomorrow.
* Priced at $399, the device is $50 more expensive than Apple’s upcoming HomePod. Sweetening the deal, each Home Max purchase comes with a free 12-month subscription to YouTube Red, which includes an ad-free YouTube Music subscription.
* The smart speaker was originally set to arrive on December 11, but Google has decided to move up the launch, likely in order to exploit HomePod’s delay to its advantage.
* Available in two distinct colors—Chalk and Charcoal—the accessory sports a pair of custom 0.7-inch tweeters and dual 4.5-inch high-excursion woofers that offer room-filling sound, with a Smart Sound feature analyzing the room and adjusting automatically for optimal sound.
* According to Google’s description:
* Google Home Max sounds pretty amazing right out of the box because it’s our first speaker with Smart Sound. Powered by Google’s artificial intelligence (AI), Smart Sound means Max can automatically adapt itself based on where it’s placed in the room. There’s no extra setup or testing required. Even if you move Max from one spot to another, it’ll continuously tune itself to the room, so your music will sound one step closer to the studio.
* Like many other smart speakers, Home Max lets you stream music from apps like YouTube Music, Pandora and Spotify, talk to your Google Assistant, manage smart home accessories, set reminders and do other things with just your voice.
* Here are the key feature highlights:
* The AI-powered audio accessory is compatible with iOS.
* The device can be used horizontally or vertically.
* It also supports wireless stereo pairing and multi–room grouping using Home Max along with Home Home Mini or a speaker with Chromecast Audio plugged in.
