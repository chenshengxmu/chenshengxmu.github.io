* Apple late Wednesday night issued a statement to several news outlets regarding launch day supply of its new iPhone 7. We’ve got the full text below, but the gist of it is that it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to walk into an Apple store on Friday and buy an iPhone 7 Plus or any model in the new Jet Black colorway.
* We couldn’t be happier with the initial response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and we are looking forward to beginning sales through our retail stores and partners around the world.
* Beginning Friday, limited quantities of iPhone 7 in silver, gold, rose gold, and black will be available for walk-in customers at Apple retail stores. During the online pre-order period, initial quantities of iPhone 7 Plus in all finishes and iPhone 7 in jet black sold out and will not be available for walk-in customers. Availability at partner locations for all finishes may vary and we recommend checking directly with them.
* Customers can continue to order all models in all colors on apple.com. We sincerely appreciate our customers’ patience as we work hard to get the new iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible.
* Apple indicated that it expected demand to outstrip supply during the iPhone 7 launch, and inventory for its new handsets are typically limited during the first weeks, but this is the worst shortage in recent memory. Shipping estimates for iPhone 7 Plus models slipped to November just minutes after pre-orders began last Friday.
