* Honda on Thursday debuted the 2016 Accord at its research facility in Mountain View. While car makers typically reserve new car unveilings for major auto shows, Honda says that it chose the location to highlight the role Silicon Valley is playing in the industry.
* The ninth-generation Accord features a thorough refresh for 2016, with a big focus on technology. All EX and above models will include a Display Audio infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen display and support for both CarPlay and Android Auto platforms.
* “Customers want their vehicles to be more intelligently integrated with their smartphone-powered lives,” said Honda VP John Mendel. “And we are committed to delivering that experience starting with Accord, retail car buyers’ most popular vehicle the past two years.”

* The 2016 Honda Accord will be one of the first high-volume vehicles to support both Android Auto and CarPlay when it goes on sale in August. There’s no official word on pricing yet, but it’s expected to be similar to the current model, which starts at $23K for the sedan.
* Apple introduced CarPlay in the spring of 2014 as a “smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car.”
