* We’ve talked quite a bit about Tim Cook’s comments at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference today. Tim Cook had talked at this same conference several times in the past, but it was his first time there as CEO of Apple.
* We already published a recap of the event where Tim Cook proved once again that he is The Man for The Job, but the guys over at MacRumors have the full transcript…
* My favorite extract:
* Now, just about every company is launching a tablet. When we look at the competitive landscape, no one really made a dent in Apple’s market. We see some innovative models, Amazon for instance. Companies undercutting the iPad. I know it’s not all about price, but what do you think about that?
* Price is rarely the most important thing. A cheap product might sell some units. Somebody gets it home and they feel great when they pay the money, but then they get it home and use it and the joy is gone. The joy is gone every day that they use it until they aren’t using it anymore. You don’t keep remembering “I got a good deal!” because you hate it!
* What happened last year, everybody that was in the PC industry and everybody in the phone industry decided they had to do a tablet. There was 100 tablets put on the market last year! They aimed at iPad 1 and by the time they came out with something we were on iPad 2. We wound up with 170,000 apps and I’m not sure there is 100 yet on the other platform. At the end of the day, people want the great product. Amazon is a different competitor. They have different strengths. They’ll sell a lot of units. They have and they will.
* But, the customers that we’re designing our products for are not satisfied with limited function types of products. I think the real catalyst of the tablet market will be innovation and pushing the next frontier. Honestly, we’ll compete with everybody. I love competition. As long as people invent their own stuff, I love competition.
