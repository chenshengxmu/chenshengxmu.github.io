* People who have busy lives often need to have a way to organize their upcoming plans so they don’t forget them, and that’s where your iPhone’s Calendar app comes in handy.
* Unfortunately, the Calendar app only lets you see upcoming events when they’re coming up very soon, and for some things, “soon” isn’t enough time to get prepared, and that’s why a jailbreak tweak called Calendar for Lockscreen 2 by VladMax Soft was developed, attempting to make everyday life easier.
* If the tweak sounds familiar, that’s because it is. It has been around for a little over three years now, but it keeps getting better with every update.
* After you install Calendar for Lockscreen 2, your upcoming Calendar events will begin to appear on the Lock screen in the order that they’re scheduled to happen. They’ll appear in a grouped notification bubble like you see above, separated only by headers and containing a brief description of the event, the place (if included), and the time.
* Perhaps my favorite part about this tweak is that it’s persistent and doesn’t go away. I also like how Apple-esque the developer made the Calendar events look on the Lock screen, because it really blends in nicely with other notifications you’ll get throughout the day.
* This is the kind of tweak that forgetful people should really consider installing, as it enables you to have a view of your calendar events on the Lock screen in front of your face at all times. After all, you see your Lock screen every day, so you should have no problem seeing your Calendar events too, and this will keep your memory jogged throughout the day.
* The tweak subliminally pounds your upcoming events into your head as you use your device so that you have plenty of heads-up notice and you can’t make up the, “I totally forgot” excuse.
* Calendar for Lockscreen 2 is going to add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure your own personal settings for the tweak:

* Here, you get the following options:
* Not only are you given a fair-sized plate of functional options, but for those of you that like to make your devices look different than everyone else’s, you’ll find beefy number of aesthetic settings too.
* Personally, as a minimalist, I think things look the best when they’re stock so that they look as close to Apple’s own design as possible. Of course, your opinion may vary depending on how heavily you’ve modified your device up to this point.
* Because I have so much going on throughout the week, being able to see all of my upcoming calendar events anywhere from one to two weeks in advance is an invaluable feature. If my daily driver iPhone were still jailbroken, I’d have to say this is would be one of my must-have tweaks just so I could have a constant reminder of what’s coming up day-by-day on a screen that I see all the time.
* If you’re interested in trying Calendar for Lockscreen 2, you can download it on your jailbroken iOS 10 device for $1.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. If you own the previous version of the tweak for iOS 9 and earlier, then the tweak is 50% off (a $0.99 upgrade).
