* Google said on Twitter this morning its machine learning-powered visual search tool, called Lens, is coming soon to its image-management app for iPhone and iPad, Google Photos.
* The feature began rolling out today to English-language Android users, who can try Lens in the Google Photos app to do things like create a contact from a business card or get more info about a famous landmark, just by pointing their camera at an object.
* If you’re on Android and are currently unable to use this feature on your device, it’s because it’s being rolled out on a gradual basis.
* The company said at Mobile World Congress 2018 that Lens would expand to Google Assistant later this year, just as with the version included in Google’s Pixel smartphone lineup.
* “We’ll add support for more devices over time,” they promised.
* Aside from automatically creating contact information from a business card and creating events from a photo in one tap, Lens will soon be able to identify the breed of a cute dog you saw in the park via expanded recognition of common animals and plants.
* Google Lens is currently a preview.
* How do you like this cool feature?
* Let us know in the comments!
