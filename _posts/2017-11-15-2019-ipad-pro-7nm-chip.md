* Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are developing a next-generation mobile chip that will make its debut in an upcoming iPad Pro revision next year.
* According to a report Wednesday by Chinese outlet MyDrivers, the chip tentatively named “A11X Bionic” set to power 2018 iPad Pros is an enhanced version of the A11 Bionic processor in the iPhone 8 and iPhone X series with more cores and, presumably, higher clock frequencies.
* Specifically, the octa-core system-on-a-chip is said to pack in three high-performance cores and five energy-efficient cores. The current A11 Bionic processor is a hexa-core chip with two high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores.
* The upcoming A11X Bionic chip will also benefit from TSMC’s seven-nanometer process technology versus the ten-nanometer process technology used to fabricate the A11 Bionic silicon. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the upcoming iPad Pro models will feature the TrueDepth camera and Face ID systems from iPhone X.
* Given the computational requirements for Face ID, the A11X Bionic chip should also integrate Apple’s neural engine for processing facial data.
* TSMC’s co-CEO CC Wei said recently that an improved version of TSMC’s seven-nanometer technology using extreme ultraviolet technology will be ready for volume production in 2018.
* TSMC board just passed a $4.29 billion budget for capacity expansion, with an additional $800 million earmarked for an “accelerated build-up for 7nm capacity,” as per CFO Lora Ho.
* It’s unclear when the new iPad Pros will be announced. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro was unveiled at WWDC in the summer although Apple up until recently used to refresh iPads in October.
