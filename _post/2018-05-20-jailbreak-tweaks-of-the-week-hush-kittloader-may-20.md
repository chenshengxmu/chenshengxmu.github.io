* While Electra for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 remains the latest jailbreak solution for Apple-branded handsets, there’s been some talk lately about new exploits that impact some of Apple’s latest firmware versions. Nevertheless, nothing has materialized just yet.
* In the meantime, anyone with a jailbroken device may take an interest in tweaking it outside of stock parameters. This roundup encompasses every jailbreak tweak released in Cydia from May 14th until May 20th. As usual, we’ll start by showcasing our favorites and then outline the rest afterward.

* CCAlarmETA is a new jailbreak tweak that adds a countdown indicator to the alarm module in Control Center whenever you have an active alarm.
* Not only is te tweak aesthetically-pleasing at first glance, but it can come in handy when you’d like to quickly discern how much time you have left before your next active alarm goes off.
* You can learn more about CCAlarmETA and how to get it in our full review.

* Many take advantage of Do Not Disturb to make their handset(s) a bit less disturbing during specific times, but now you can augment the Do Not Disturb experience with a new jailbreak tweak called Hush.
* With Hush, you can quickly enable Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone by placing the device face-down on a flat surface. It utilizes your device’s internal sensors to detect this orientation, and you need not worry about false positives because you can configure a custom delay.
* You can learn more about Hush and why you might want to give it a try in our full review.

* KITTLoader is a new free jailbreak tweak that enhances the look of your iPhone’s Status Bar-based activity indicator.
* It replaces the traditional spinning wheel with an animation that looks tantamount to a ping-pong ball moving from left to right. The animation appears when your device performs any application or internet activity, just like the stock activity indicator would.
