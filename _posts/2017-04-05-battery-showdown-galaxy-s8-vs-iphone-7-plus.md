* Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy handsets are typically outfitted with some of the best-performing batteries. That said, you could imagine our surprise when we learned that the battery in Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S8+ performed worse than the cell powering Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, as per a new test carried out by review website PhoneArena.
* Samsung’s device beat flagship Android phones in battery-life tests and bested Apple’s regular-sized 4.7-inch iPhone 7. PhoneArena discovered that the 3,500 mAh battery inside Galaxy S8+ lets it run for exactly eight hours before needing recharging.
* Samsung’s phone has a massive display measuring 6.2 inches diagonally that uses AMOLED display technology which requires a fraction of the power consumed by traditional LCD screens because it doesn’t need a power-hungry backlight.
* Galaxy S8+ also comes outfitted Samsung’s powerful in-house designed Exynos 8895 chip (some versions come with Qualcomm’s processor), but it, too, uses less power than its predecessor as the chip is fabbed on a smaller ten-nanometer process technology.
* iPhone 7 comes with a 1,960 mAh battery rated for a capacity of 7.45 watt-hours, which is a notable increase from the 6.55 watt-hour battery in last year’s model.
* iPhone 7 Plus has a bigger 2,900 mAh battery for a total of 11.1 watt-hours, representing a slight upgrade over the 10.45 watt-hour battery in iPhone 6s Plus and on par with the 2,915 mAh, 11.1 watt-hour cell found inside iPhone 6 Plus.
* Here are the test results:
* Many Galaxy devices feature Samsung’s praised Fast Adaptive Charging technology.
* Galaxy S8+ is no exception: as per PhoneArena, charging the device from 0 percent to 100 percent takes about one hour and forty seconds. “This is not the fastest we have seen, but it is not too far off,” reads the article.

* Although Galaxy S8+ also supports fast wireless charging, charging times are way longer when using a wireless charger. PhoneArena’s standard battery tests compare all devices on equal grounds by using common settings, including setting the screen brightness at 200 nits, which is comfortable for indoor use.
