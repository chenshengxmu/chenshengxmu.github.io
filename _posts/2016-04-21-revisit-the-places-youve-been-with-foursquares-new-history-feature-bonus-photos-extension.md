* Since launching in 2009, there have been over nine billion check-ins on Foursquare across the globe. Celebrating its seventh anniversary, the startup pushed an update to its mobile application on the App Store which includes a handy new history features.
* Similar to location history on Google, the updated Foursquare app makes it simple for users to browse any place they’ve been and checked into via a new History tab.
* In addition, Foursquare now has its own Photos extension which makes it super easy to share a photo as a tip, right within the context of the Photos app.
* “Sometimes, we’re not sure if you’ve been somewhere or if we just think you have, so the new tab makes it easier than ever to set the record straight,” release notes read. “By knowing the places you’ve been, we get better and better at recommending places we know you’ll love.”
* Just tap the History tab at the bottom to get started. You will be presented with an scrollable list of the places your previously checked into, grouped by date. To search your history by place, category or location, tap the magnifying glass icon at the top.

* Adding places to history tells Foursquare about the types of places you like to go, which in turn helps them make better recommendations for you. In settings, you can elect to badge the app’s icon for new places. If you do that, a badge will appear on the Foursquare app icon on your Home screen when there are new places to add to your history.
* The history feature is also available in Foursquare’s Swarm app.
* Foursquare 9.16 for iOS includes a Photos extension for sharing a photo as a tip on Foursquare. Simply tap a photo within the Photos app, tap the Share icon and then tap the Foursquare icon in the menu, labeled “Leave a tip on Foursquare”.

* You may need to tap the More icon located at the rightmost side the Share menu and turn on Foursquare’s Share action. After you select Foursquare in the Share menu, a sheet pops up.
* At this point, you should write a short description of the photo and tap Pick a place to choose a location where you took the image. If you snapped a photo with your iPhone and it has embedded location information, Foursquare will automatically list nearby places that match the photo’s geographical coordinates.

* As the last step, tap Post and your tip will be published on Foursquare.
* In celebrating its anniversary, the company’s data gurus have put together a cool side-by-side visualization of all check-ins posted from 2010 through 2015. Today, the service sees an overage of more than eight million check-ins a day on the platform.
* Foursquare requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later.
* It offers a native app for your Apple Watch and is localized in English, Catalan, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Turkish.
* Foursquare is available at no charge in the App Store.
