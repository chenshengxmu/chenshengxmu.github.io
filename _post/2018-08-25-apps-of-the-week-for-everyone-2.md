* This week’s edition of our Apps of the Week roundup includes an app for throwing and finding parties, a photo editor with an ink-resting twist, and an app for taking short, looping videos. And as always, we’ve selected two great new games for you to check out.

* So this is pretty interesting. Rendevous is essentially Tinder for parties. Whether you are hosting an event and would like to invite people outside of your social circle, or you’re looking for something fun to do on a Friday night, it seems like this app is worth checking out. Obviously there are going to be some safety concerns here, but the host has full control, and event details remain private until a guest has been confirmed.

* Discover your photo’s inner art. Inkwork instantly transforms your photos into unique and expressive ink drawings. Choose from over 90 style variations, select your ink and paper color, then share your creation on your favorite social network. Want to hang your new art on the wall? Inkwork has teamed up with CanvasPop to deliver your artwork in a quality print right to your doorstep.

* This one’s kind of cool. Flip is a way to seamlessly capture and upload video while on the go. Simply open the app, hold down the Record button to capture a short engaging video, and the clip is automatically uploaded so it can be shared. I know, there are thousands of apps that record video, but there’s something intriguing to me about one that’s focused on short, looping videos. Plus Flip has editors that hand-pick their favorite clips and post them to the app’s Explore page.

* Between The Walls is a Pong inspired single player arcade with a twist. Bounce between the walls and survive as long as you can. Pick up modes, avoid obstacles and master your reflexes on various levels. Score as many points as you can and be first in the leaderboards. You can even collect coins to use in the shop to buy new skins. This is one of those pick-up-and-play type of games, which are always a good time.

There are 60 interesting puzzles, which vary in difficulty, and a strange science fiction story told without words. What’s the big Mars mystery? You’ll have to play to find out.
