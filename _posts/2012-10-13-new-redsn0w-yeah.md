* The iPhone Dev-Team has released a significant update for its popular jailbreak utility known as RedSn0w tonight. The update brings the software to version 0.9.15b1, and includes a number of new features.
* A4 device owners will be happy to hear that Cydia is now included in the tethered iOS 6 jailbreak, so no more SSH work, and you can now restore devices to earlier firmware without the lengthy stitching process.
* We’ve got the full change log after the break…
* From the Dev-Team’s blog:
* And as for those iOS 5 restores on A5+ devices:
* 1. Redsn0w now lets you restore an A5+ device from any iOS5 to any other iOS5 as long as you have correct 5.x blobs for the starting (current) and ending points of the restore
* 2. You DO NOT QUALIFY for iOS5-to-iOS5 restores if you got to your current 5.x via an OTA update
* 3. Unlike the A4 devices, redsn0w can’t (usefully) prevent the baseband updates of A5+ iPhones and iPads.
* 4. iPad2 owners (all three models) with saved 4.x blobs can use those instead, even from 6.x
* We realize that this is a lot of information to take in, but rest assured that we’ll be covering the major features in greater detail soon. And Jeff should be along anytime now with his signature video tutorials.
* Also remember that the iOS 6 jailbreak is still very much in beta, and isn’t ready yet for many devices. If you have questions on that, click here to read our post on the state of the iOS 6 jailbreak. It should help.
* If you are looking to jailbreak iOS 6, we do have a step-by-step guide on how to do it. And as always, you can find the latest version of RedSn0w both PC and Mac computers in our Downloads Section.
* Stay tuned.
