* Dutch 3D artist Martin Hajek has become something of a household name in the Apple community with his painstakingly designed mockups imagining unreleased Apple products.
* Today, Hajek published his latest renderings depicting what a massive 6.7-inch iPhone X Plus model would look like next to today’s iPhone X. The best bit: Apple could easily fit a 6.7-inch OLED panel inside a Plus-sized chassis by taking advantage of a near fullscreen design.

* To create renderings of an imaginary Galaxy Note-sized Apple smartphone, Hajek used his own 3D files for the 5.8-inch iPhone X model as a starting point to see “what would happen if the screen size would be increased by the same factor as the iPhone 8 to iPhone 8 Plus ratio.”
* The results are pretty convincing, as you can see for yourself.
* I’d actually say it’s inevitable.

* Mind you, his renderings aren’t just wishful thinking.
* As a quick refresher, several supply chain sources have said that Apple would most likely expand the iPhone lineup as soon as next year by adding at least one new X-style device to the mix, outfitted with a massive 6.46-inch edge-to-edge display.
* Some sources, like The Korean Herald, even predicted that there would be two new OLED iPhone sizes next year, 5.85 and 6.46 inches, basically putting the flagship 2018 iPhone X model on par with Samsung’s Note series in terms of screen size.
* I think there’s nothing wrong with that because people love options.
* How about you?
* Should Apple offer us even more choices beyond the regular and Plus-sized iPhone models, do you think? Do we really need a larger iPhone X or does the one-size-fits-all approach work when it comes to iPhone X design?
