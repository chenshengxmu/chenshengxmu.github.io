* Folks with an iPhone on T-Mobile might be interested to hear that there’s a new hacked carrier update available that promises a number of enhancements. It was created by the same folks who brought us that slew of carrier update hacks for Sprint, Verizon and AT&T iPhone models last summer.
* This time around, the developers say that the modded update includes a variety of things like boosted data speeds and signal reception (depending on your location). It also adds several native T-Mobile features to your iPhone like the ability to view account balance, texts sent and other usage info…
* Here’s the list of the update’s features and improvements:
* Before you get too excited, note that your iPhone must be jailbroken and support for the features listed above will obviously vary depending on your model. Additionally, there’s no guarantees you’ll see significant improvement in your device’s performance—your success will depend on various factors.
* It’s also worth mentioning that the process for installing this new hacked carrier update seems far more complex than previous versions, so it’s definitely not for the faint of heart. But if you’re feeling froggy, go ahead and leap. Joe has a full step-by-step tutorial and video walkthrough over at iTweakiOS.
* Admittedly, we haven’t tried the new hack out for ourselves yet, but readers have reported success with similar hacks in the past.
