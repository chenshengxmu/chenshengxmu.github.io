* For those who still have their jailbreaks, it’s been pretty slow in terms of jailbreak tweak releases recently. The lack of a recent public jailbreak for everyone paired with the loss of interest in iOS 9 is, without a shadow of doubt, making things rough for jailbreak developers.
* Regardless, we put together a roundup every week to showcase everything new in Cydia, so following that tradition, we’ll be doing the same this week, starting with our favorites and moving on to all the rest afterwards.
* Quickify – FREE

* Quickify is a new free jailbreak tweak that brings the ability to save music to Spotify right to Control Center and the Lock screen.
* As you will see, the tweak adds a button just to the right of the fast-forward button of your music controls, which makes it possible to add or remove a song you’re listening to into your “Songs” section of the app.
* Because it’s available on the Lock screen and in Control Center, you never really have to stop what you’re doing to save a song. You can do it from anywhere in iOS, and that’s what makes it really convenient.
* You can read our full review of Quickify to learn more about how it works.
* AntiTracker: Notifies you every time someone tracks you with Find My Friends (free – review)
* Speak This Flipswitch: A flipswitch toggle for the Speak Selection option on your iPhone (free)
* Although that wraps it up for this week, a continuation of the slow times upon us, the jailbreak certainly isn’t dead just yet. We’ll be updating you throughout the week as new jailbreak tweaks surface and we’ll see you back here again next Sunday.
