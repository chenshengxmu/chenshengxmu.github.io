* Micro-blogging startup Twitter on Tuesday announced a major expansion of native video length, with users able to upload videos to the service which can now be up to 140 seconds long, or two minutes and twenty seconds. Before today, Twitter video uploads were capped at thirty seconds. This change is scheduled to go into effect soon and will require an updated mobile app.
* “Now, everyone can post videos up to 140 seconds long,” said the firm. “We can’t wait to see the amazing videos you create and share.”
* According to Twitter’s own stats, video tweets on the service have increased by over fifty percent since the beginning of 2016. Like before, select publishers can post videos up to ten minutes long through Twitter’s dedicated publisher tools.

* The firm is also making it easier to explore the videos with the ability to tap a video tweet or Vine on your timeline to go into a new, full-screen viewing experience. In this mode, other relevant videos and Vine tweets are suggested at the bottom of the screen.
* Longer video uploads are also coming to Twitter-owned Vine video-sharing app. Last but not least, Twitter launched a brand new analytics app, called Twitter Engage, which provides real-time data and insights into how your tweets are performing.
* Twitter is available at no charge on the App Store.
