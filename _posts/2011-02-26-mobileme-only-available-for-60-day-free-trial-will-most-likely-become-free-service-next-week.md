* Apple has removed the paid version of MobileMe from its retail stores and website. You can now only sign up for a free 60-day trial on the web.
* Apple is holding an event next week, and MobileMe will most likely be revamped alongside the introduction of a new iPad model. Up until now, MobileMe has cost $99/year. There’s a good chance that Apple will make their cloud-based service free for customers, or introduce some type of tiered, “pro” pricing alongside the standard MobileMe package.
* We expect MobileMe to be a much bigger part of iOS if Apple does in fact make it free for all users. A free, cloud-based service from Apple would most likely include some form of the iDisk for internet data storage that syncs between the desktop and other iDevices.

* It is worth mentioning that Apple’s website still says MobileMe will cost $99/year after the trial, but all indications point to a new, cheaper version of MobileMe coming very soon.
* Services like DropBox already do a great job of syncing data across platforms, but a revamped Apple solution would definitely be a viable contender. MobileMe hasn’t been doing so hot lately, and Apple’s cloud-based data storage has been buggy and sluggish for users.
* If you don’t already have a MobileMe account, we advise you to hold off on starting a free trial until Apple’s event on Wednesday. Even though the trial is free, it would be wise to wait and see what Apple has up its sleeve.
