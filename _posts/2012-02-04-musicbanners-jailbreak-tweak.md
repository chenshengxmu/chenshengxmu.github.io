* If you use the iPod app on your iOS device as much as I do, then you’re going to love the new jailbreak tweak: MusicBanners. The tweak, made by popular developer Ryan Petrich, brings your music to iOS 5’s notification system.
* So what does it do? Essentially, MusicBanners sends you a notification every time a new track comes up on your iPod app. This means that you receive a notification with the track’s name, album and cover art after every song change…
* As usual, Petrich’s tweak works flawlessly — both banners and notifications look and act like native iOS elements. And for those wondering, it doesn’t appear to be limited to the default iPod app. I can confirm that the tweak works with Pandora, and am assuming it works with other apps as well.
* Even if you don’t think you’ll end up keeping it, MusicBanners is definitely worth a look. You can download the tweak from Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for free.
* What do you think of MusicBanners?
