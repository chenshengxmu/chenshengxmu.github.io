* Google’s YouTube app for iOS is undergoing some changes amid a broader redesign and rebranding effort reflected in the service’s revamped logo and icon, announced earlier today.
* The new logo is now part of YouTube’s recently overhauled Material Design look on desktop, which the search company said is available to all users around the globe starting today.
* As we reported earlier, one of the best features of this new desktop design is Dark Theme, which turns the background dark while you watch for a more cinematic look.

* In fact, the refreshed YouTube experience looks cleaner and more consistent across both desktop and mobile, with shared features like Dark Mode and adjustable speed playback.
* Get a feel for the changes coming to YouTube for iOS in Google’s video below.
* The mobile YouTube app is scheduled to gain the following improvements.
* Last but not least, the redesigned YouTube logo does away with the “Tube” part of the branding, relocating the logo’s TV-like icon to the left of the brand name.

* The updated logo combines a cleaned up version of the YouTube wordmark and icon which it says creates a more flexible design that works better across a variety of devices.

* On the tiniest screens, for example, the brightened up icon serves an abbreviated logo. “You’ll see the new logo and icon roll out across mobile and desktop today, and across all our other apps and services soon,” said the Mountain View-headquartered firm.
* YouTube for iOS is available free in App Store.
