* Microsoft Canada on Friday published an interesting commercial on its Facebook Page depicting “the world’s first wireless orchestra” comprised of New York City’s celebrated subway musicians kept in sync with a remote conductor thanks to Skype.
* The video features a bunch of Apple’s MacBook Pro notebooks that run the Skype software, while iPhones make a few notable appearances as well.
* Someone in Cupertino should send marketing wizards in Redmond a thank you note for advertising for Apple.
* “We searched NYC for a variety of subway musicians to unite for a live experiment,” explains the firm. “We stationed them at nine different subway stops with Wi/Fi and had them simultaneously connect to composer Ljova.”
* The composer then led the orchestra in a performance of “Signal Strength,” an original piece he wrote for them. Check out the world’s first wireless orchestra in Microsoft’s Skype ad below.
* The point of the ad is not Apple, it’s Skype and its low-latency video chatting capabilities. Speaking of Skype, Microsoft just announced a web version of Skype with chatting, audio and video running directly in any modern desktop browser, no plug-in needed.
* I like that the musicians in the ad are all using iPhones. In fact, I challenge you to find a single non-Apple device in the commercial, Bose headphones excluded.
