* Good news for would be jailbreakers running iOS 8.1.1: MuscleNerd, the famous hacker and one of the leaders of the jailbreak movement, has granted his blessing to the TaiG jailbreak.
* As you’ll recall, this weekend, TaiG came out of nowhere to release and iOS 8.1.1 jailbreak. As a result, and because relatively little is known about TaiG, many people felt it better to wait before some of the more well-known hackers could take a look at the package.
* In a series of tweets, MuscleNerd has vouched for the safety of the TaiG jailbreak, effectively opening the floodgates to the masses. Have a look inside for the details.
* Nothing too unsettling with that TaiG JB…just some light device fingerprinting. To see that, create an empty debuglog.cfg file next…

* After taking a look at the code, MuscleNerd states that there is “nothing too unsettling” with regard to TaiG’s work. He even states that TaiG’s work is “much more transparent than Pangu”. This is good news, as TaiG’s name had previously been linked with a Chinese pirated app store that came bundled with the initial versions of the Evasi0n7 jailbreak for iOS 7. As a result, the group’s reputation was sullied, leading many to question whether or not they should trust their devices in the hands of TaiG.
* The untether is much more transparent than Pangu (unobfuscated, and kernel is left open to inspection via "standard" task_for_pid0 patch)

* I should note that the TaiG jailbreak does still include some sort of alternate “store” which users will need to opt out of before jailbreaking. You can download TaiG and see our full iOS 8.1.1 jailbreak tutorial for directions on how to do that.
* With MuscleNerd’s comments, has your opinion changed at all about the TaiG jailbreak? If you were sitting on the fence, has it changed your stance at all? Sound off down below in the comments section.
