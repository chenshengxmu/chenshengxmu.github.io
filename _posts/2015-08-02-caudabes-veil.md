* Some people take such good care of their mobile devices that, for the most part, they don’t really need any protection. Those people tend to prefer their iPhone 6 to be completely uncovered to show off Apple’s beautiful design.
* But, there is always the slightest chance that the soft aluminum of the iPhone 6 could be exposed to minor scuffs and scratches, providing a need for the thinnest of protection. The Veil fits into this ultra thin market with its ultra thinnest design.
* So far, the thinnest case that I’ve found in my research measures just 0.35mm, although I’ve heard rumors that there is a 0.3mm one on the market, but I’ve yet to confirm that. The Veil is one of those cases that do indeed boast a 0.35mm skin.
* It is made from polypropylene, which is hard enough to snap tightly into place around your iPhone 6, but flexible enough to make it easy to put on.
* Although it can proudly claim to be one of the thinnest iPhone 6 cases, it does also provide protection around the protruding camera lens. A ridge around the back-facing camera and flash measures .7mm thick to keep your lens rim protected when lying flat.
* The volume buttons, mute switch, and Sleep/Wake button all have cutaways so you can easily access your iPhone 6 controls. The bottom of the case is exposed, except for the corners, to allow unfettered use of the speakers and ports.
* The Veil comes in Wisp Black or Blue and is available on Amazon for $15. There is also a version available for the iPhone 6 Plus in Wisp Black or Frost for $16.
