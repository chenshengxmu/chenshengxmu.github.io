* With watchOS 5, Apple Watch owners can finally rearrange the Control Center toggles to their liking. Last year, iOS 11 treated iPhone users to a customizable Control Center. But unlike iOS, watchOS 5 lets you reorder the toggles so this is a major win for the Apple wearable.
* Highlights:
* Let’s get to it.
* To adjust the order of the various Control Center toggles so they suit your needs, do the following on your Apple WATch with the watch OS 5 software or newer:
* 1) Swipe up from the bottom of your watch face to invoke Control Center (in case you didn’t know this, watchOS 5 also lets you access Control and Notification Center from inside apps).
* 2) Scroll down and tap the Edit button.
* 3) When the icons start wriggling like they’re dancing, rearrange them by way of dragging.

* 4) Tap Done to save the changes.
* And voilà, say hello to your newly personalized Control Center!
* Keep in mind that you cannot do this through the companion Watch app on your iPhone.
* The layout of the Control Center toggles varies from one Apple Watch model to another.
* As an example, the original Apple Watch doesn’t have the Expel Water toggle. Similarly, LTE-enabled watches feature a Cellular toggle in their Control Center that doesn’t show up on non-LTE models. Different people have different needs so making watchOS’s Control Center your own is contingent upon your daily usage patterns.
* If you happen to own an LTE-enabled watch but don’t use LTE connectivity much, you may want to drag that Cellular toggle down the list to make room for a more frequently-used item.
* Frequent moviegoers, on the other hand, might want to move the Theater Mode toggle higher than the Expel Water button for quick access.
* Conversely, those who rarely use Theater Mode may reorganize their Control Center so that their most frequently-used toggles, like Do Not Disturb or Battery, are found at the very top of the Control Center overlay.
