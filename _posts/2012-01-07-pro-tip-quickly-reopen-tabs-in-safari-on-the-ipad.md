title: How to reopen recently closed tabs in Safari on iPhone or iPad
---
* While this tip may seem a little trivial, it will most likely solve an annoyance that many of us have experienced when surfing the web on the iPad or iPhone.
* When you’re browsing in Safari and you accidentally close a tab, it can be a pain to try and find that URL again in your history or search recommendations. That’s why there’s a handy little option for opening recently closed tabs on iPhone and iPad.

* Step 1: In Safari, tap and hold on the ” + ” icon for a couple seconds
* Step 2: A list of recently closed tabs will pop up. Tap on the link you want to reopen.
* The principle is pretty much the same on iPhone, except that the New Tab icon isn’t as easily accessible.
