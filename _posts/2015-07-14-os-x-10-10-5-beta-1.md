* In addition to posting iOS 8.4.1 beta 1, Apple on Tuesday released the first beta of what would become the fifth major Yosemite software update. OS X 10.10.5 beta 1 is now available for download to members of the Apple Developer Program through Apple’s portal for developers.
* It’s unclear what new features, if any, the pre-release OS X 10.10.5 software (build number 14F6a) may bring to Mac fans when it launches for public consumption.
* The official release notes for OS X 10.10.5 beta suggest this is primarily a bug-fix release as the document makes no mention of any new features.
* “The OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac,” reads the changelog.
* Members of Apple Developer Program can install the software through the OS X Software Update Seed Configuration Utility, by choosing Software Update from the Apple menu.
* If the new OS X Software Update Seed Configuration Utility is not installed on your Mac, first log into your Apple Developer account and download this app.
* The Mac App Store will open automatically after the app has been installed on your Mac. Now click on the Mac App Store’s Updates tab and the new OS X 10.10.5 build will be available for download.
* The Mac App Store will push a notification alert when a newer seed build is available. To stop receiving new seed builds, choose App Store in System Preferences and click the Change button next to “Your computer is set to receive pre-release Software Update seeds.”
* We’ll keep you updated as we learn more about the full contents of this update.
* OS X 10.10.4, which Apple released on June 30 alongside iOS 8.4 with support for Apple Music, has resolved much of the Wi-Fi woes by replacing the problematic ‘Discoveryd’ network process with the old, way more reliable ‘mDNSResponder’ process.
