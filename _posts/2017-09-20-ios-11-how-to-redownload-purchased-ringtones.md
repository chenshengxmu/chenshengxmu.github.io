* Have you ever purchased a ringtone from Apple only to forget to back it up in iTunes on your computer? If so, chances are you couldn’t sync your ringtone back after setting up your iPhone or iPad from scratch because you no longer had the original audio file in the first place.
* The good news is, your purchased ringtones are still yours.
* iOS 11 comes with the new ability to redownload any ringtones you’ve previously purchased using your Apple ID, here’s how. Note that this feature is not available on older iOS editions.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your device.
* 2) Touch Sounds or Sounds & Haptics in the list.
* 3) Now tap on any sound in the list.
* 4) If you’ve purchased ringtones from iTunes in the past and they’re still available on the store, you should see the option labeled Download All Purchased Tones at the top of the page.

* Tap it and iOS will redownload all ringtones and alert tones purchased from iTunes using your Apple ID account and make them available right away through Settings → Sounds & Haptics.
* And just like that, I got that Jessie J ringtone back that I bought years ago!
* Apple cautions that you might not be able to redownload some of your purchased tones, which usually happens if the owner has pulled them from iTunes Store for whatever reason.

* You can use these tones to customize your ringtone, text tone, new mail alert sound, calendar alerts and more, as well as set a ringtone or text tone for a specific contact to know who’s messaging or calling you even when an iPhone is in your pocket.
* Apple has brought about some major changes to desktop iTunes with the release of iTunes 12.7 for Mac and Windows. As a result, the ability to browse and download ringtones from iTunes Store is no longer available in the app.
