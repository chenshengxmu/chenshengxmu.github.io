title: Readdle revamps Documents for iPad with cloud integration and powerful media management
---
* If you use your iPad even occasionally to edit Office documents on the go, chances are you were disappointed hearing that Google snapped up Quickoffice, the maker of the popular mobile productivity suite of the same name. Worry not, Readdle comes to the rescue. Depicted above is their freshly updated Documents software which in this new incarnation becomes the perfect document and media manager for your iPad.
* It’s tightly integrated with iCloud and other popular cloud-based storage solutions for seamless experience across multiple devices. While Documents won’t let you edit your stuff, you can view your media and documents and it’s a pretty decent file manager. Best of all, it’s free of charge…
* Other features include the ability to read and annotate PDF files, search inside documents and read books and articles. Though you can view Office documents on your iPad, Documents only allows you to edit plain text files.
* As for media management, Documents lets you enjoy your photos, watch movies and listen to your music and provides a nice file manager to copy documents from your desktop to an iPad, with built-in password protection for the files.
* The app can also sync your stuff across iCloud, Dropbox, GoogleDocs and other services, even download documents from the web, save pages for later reading and store email attachments.
* I previously used Documents, but version 4.0 is a whole new app and you’re highly recommended to check it out.
* Matt Brian has a nice review up on The Next Web, if you’re interested to learn more.
* At $0, you really can’t go wrong.
* Let me know down in the comments what you guys think of the software.
