* It looks like Verizon is going to add to its already impressive LTE coverage map next week. The carrier announced on Thursday that it plans to flip the 4G switch on in more than 20 new markets on May 17.
* Folks with an LTE-flavored iPad will be able to take advantage of Verizon’s Long Term network in Myrtle Beach, SC, Jersey Shore, NJ (fist pump) and other northeast areas. Keep reading for the full list…
* It’s seriously mind-blowing how far ahead Verizon is of the other US carriers in terms of LTE deployment. AT&T isn’t even in 50 markets yet with the technology, and Sprint is even further behind. And T-Mobile isn’t even thinking about LTE until 2013.
* Well, at least you’ll know which carrier to go with when Apple releases its LTE iPhone.
