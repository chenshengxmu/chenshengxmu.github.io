* As most of you know, Apple released a new version of iOS 7.1 for developers yesterday. Itâ€™s the fourth beta for the next major update to iOS, and as you can imagine, weâ€™ve been asked a number of times if it kills the month-old evasion7 jailbreak software.
* Well we donâ€™t know for sure, which is why weâ€™ve been holding off on reporting about this, but weâ€™ve received word that itâ€™s likely it does. And iH8sn0w added weight to the theory this morning, saying that it looks like beta 4 patches evasion7â€™s kernel exploitâ€¦
* So the code sign bug that evasi0n7 uses still exists in 7.1b4. Kernel exploit looks patched though ðŸ˜›

* .@riznare meaningâ€¦ Donâ€™t expect an evasi0n7 update for 7.1b4+ support.

* And hereâ€™s a tweet from jailbreak developer CoolStar:
* It seems the patches 7.1b4 makes to the parts evasi0n7 exploits wonâ€™t do anything. Hereâ€™s dyld.patch, for example. pic.twitter.com/PNdtKy3Rps

* If any of this is true, then it would spell bad news for evasi0n7 and future jailbreakers. You would think that the softwareâ€”which was first released on December 22â€”would either have to be reworked to use different exploits, or completely scrapped and rebuilt.
* The bottom line is: weâ€™re still holding out on confirmation from pod2g or one of the other evad3rs that iOS 7.1 beta 4 patches a key exploit, but itâ€™s still probably a good idea for jailbreakers to stay away from the beta and make sure theyâ€™re on firmware 7.0.4.
* Update:Â it looks like we were right to have our reservations. MuscleNerd just added to the conversation:
* To all the newer JBers: we rarely comment on whether exploits are closed in betas. Thereâ€™s no advantage..if anything, it just helps *Apple*

* Now, this doesnâ€™t mean that beta 4 doesnâ€™t patch evasi0n7, it just means we donâ€™t know anything for sure yet.
