* The Force Awakens trailer releases are causing a great disturbance in the Force. If you are particularly interested in seeing additional sneak preview details, any Star Wars fan would tell you to view the Disney release Japanese trailer that contains footage not released to English speaking audiences.
* With the movie just more than one month away, the Wallpapers of the Week section is hoping to help celebrate the excitement. Inside this week’s installment are a few images from and inspired by The Force Awakens. Of course, we must also pay homage to the original trilogy.
* The following collection was gleaned from iDeviceArt, which has a large library of download-ready wallpaper images for iPhone and Desktop. Also catch @iDeviceArt on Twitter for previews of the collections.

* Currently, we are looking for The Force Awakens wallpapers. With the movie still unreleased, there should be a growing collection of images appearing over the next month. Hopefully, we will have a great collection to release just before the box office opens in mid-December. To submit images, make sure they are pre-formatted for the latest iOS devices and photo quality. There are a lot of garbage resolution versions out there.
* Update: Here are a bunch of Star Wars: The Force Awakens iPhone wallpapers
* Send them my way on Twitter via @jim_gresham. Remember, twitter compresses imagery. Upload them first to dropbox or a similar service, then shoot them my way! A direct link to the download will work too, if it is already hosted online.
