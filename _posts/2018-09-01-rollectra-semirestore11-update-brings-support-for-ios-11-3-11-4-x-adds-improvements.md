* Electra is the primary way to achieve a jailbreak on iOS 11 these days, but it’s still a great idea to have an un-jailbreak tool handy just in case something goes wrong. Rollectra/SemiRestore11, released in July by former Electra Team member Pwn20wnd, quickly filled these shoes. It utilized APFS snapshots to revert any device pwned with Electra to a stock state.
* As of this week, however, Pwn20wnd released an updated version of the tool. Version 1.1-2 is available both as an upgrade in Cydia and as a separate jailed package that can be side-loaded even when you aren’t in a jailbroken state.

* It shouldn’t matter which version you install, as they’re merely different means of achieving the same result.
* For those on iOS 11.2.x, just sit tight. Pwn20wnd is working on another update for Rollectra/SemiRestore11 that will bring official support to your neighborhood shortly. Of course, we’ll update you when that happens.
