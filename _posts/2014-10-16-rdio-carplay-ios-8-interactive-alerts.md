* Following a recent overhaul with new features, free streaming in more than two dozen countries and other perks, Rdio, the popular Internet service, on Thursday pushed a major iOS 8 focused update.
* Following in the footsteps of rival Spotify which two weeks ago added support for CarPlay, Apple’s in-car iPhone entertainment system, Rdio has now jumped on the automotive bandwagon, too.
* In addition to music playback and navigating your favorites and playlists from the built-in display in CarPlay-enabled cars, Rdio 3.0.4 has a handy new control to adjust streaming quality (should prove indispensable to those concerned about cellular data usage).
* Moreover, this update adds support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, iOS 8’s Interactive Notifications (you can play music and follow other users directly from an alert) plus other nice-to-haves mentioned after the jump.
* Rdio 3.0.4 changelog:
* Rdio is available free of charge in the App Store.
* The 52-megabyte iPhone and iPad app requires iO 6.0 or later. Not in one of the markets supported by Rdio’s free streaming? Not a problem, subscriptions are just tap away through In-App Purchases, starting at a very competitive eight bucks per month.
