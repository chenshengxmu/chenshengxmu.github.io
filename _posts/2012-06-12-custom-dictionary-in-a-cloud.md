* While we already know a ton about the major new features in iOS 6,  we are still learning about the update’s lesser-known enhancements. Things that didn’t make it into Apple’s keynote yesterday.
* The latest one we’ve come across, as pointed out by Gizmodo, is that your customized (personalized, whatever) dictionary gets the iCloud treatment in iOS 6, syncing it across all devices…
* Gizmodo explains:
* “If you repeatedly use a word that’s not in Apple’s standard dictionary—like “duckface,” or calling your girlfriend “scootboooty,” your phone will stop trying to correct you and just add it to the list of real words. Now this list of all your slang, inside jokes, and abbreviations, will be stored on iCloud forever.”
* While this may not be a groundbreaking feature, it’s a nice little touch that will make life easier for folks who communicate with others across multiple iOS devices. Bazinga.
