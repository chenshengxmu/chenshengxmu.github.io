* Even though Siri has received mixed reviews, a majority of the public seems to like the digital assistant. Folks are chomping at the bit for the feature to be ported to the iPhone 4 and other non-approved devices. And some are even hoping it finds its way to the Mac.
* While we wait for Siri to arrive on the desktop by way of either Apple or hackers, this workaround might help fill the void. It allows users to dictate text on their desktop computers (Mac or PC) using Siri. It doesn’t cost any money, and it’s actually really easy to do…
* TUAW passes along the obvious tip, which suggests that iPhone 4S owners use a remote application to dictate text on their desktops. Apps like Mobile Mouse connect to a desktop client over Wi-Fi, allowing users to remotely type on their computers using their phone.
* We tested the theory using Mobile Mouse Lite (a free application) on an iPhone 4S and a MacBook. Setup involved installing Mobile Mouse’s desktop client — and that’s it. After launching the iPhone app, we were dictating text to the Mac within seconds. We found the process to be both speedy and accurate.
* Sure, there is dictation software available for desktops, but those apps can run upwards of $50. If you want to try this free method out for yourself, you can download Mobile Mouse Lite from the App Store. Even the pro version (more features, no ads) only costs $2.00.
