* It’s been a pretty big night for iOS gamers. Hot on the heels of the release of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour has gone live in the App Store. This is the 4th [obviously] title in Gameloft’s successful first-person shooter series, and it features the same great gameplay with some upgraded graphics…

* The first thing you’ll notice about Zero Hour is its visuals. The new Havok Engine gives the title life-like animations, and dynamic objects. Gameloft, in fact, feels confident enough to describe the game’s graphics as “console-quality.” You may also be able to tell that the game has improved sound effects and voice acting.
* The real star of Modern Combat 4, though, is its redesigned multiplayer mode. The campaign mode stays mostly the same, albeit the fact that you now get to play the villain, Edward Page. But the multiplayer mode features an all new ranking system, and a new loadout system with more than 20,000 weapon arrangements.
* If all this sounds appealing to you, you can find Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour in the App Store for $6.99. It’s universal, so you’ll only have to pay for the game once and you’ll be able to play it on all of your iOS devices.
* Have you tried Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour yet? What’d you think?
