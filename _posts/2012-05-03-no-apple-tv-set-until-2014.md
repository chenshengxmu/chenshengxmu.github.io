* Despite the fact that Apple hasn’t given any indication that it’s working on a TV set, and a glaring lack of any concrete evidence, the Apple-branded television is one of the most highly anticipated products of 2012. It seems like everyone thinks it’s coming.
* Everyone except JP Morgan’s Mark Moskowitz, that is. In a note to investors this morning, the analyst said that he doesn’t believe that economic conditions are right for Apple to release a TV set this year. And he doesn’t think we’ll see one until at least 2014…
* AppleInsider reports:
* “According to the analyst, the TV industry is experiencing “strained” economics, despite the fact that several television makers offer “suitable solutions. “We are not sure that the Apple premium could prevail in the TV market, unless there is a radical change of the user interface, integration of the TV programming and data content, and use of gesture or voice control,” he said.”
* Admittedly, Moskowitz has a point. Putting together an innovative TV set by itself is a tall order, never mind trying to secure content deals with the ruthless executives of Hollywood. Add in the aforementioned weak economy, and you have a couple of solid reasons for why we won’t see an Apple television this year.
* The analyst does believe, however, that we will eventually see a full-fledged TV set from the Cupertino company. But until then, he thinks that we’ll continue to see steady refreshes of the popular set top box with additional content and features.
* Here’s your chance to be the pundit. Is Moskowitz right, or will we see an Apple television within the next 12 months?
