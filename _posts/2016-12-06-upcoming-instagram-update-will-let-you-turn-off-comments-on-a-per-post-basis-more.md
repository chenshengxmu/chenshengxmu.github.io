* In its never-ending fight to curb abuse on its service, Instagram today said an upcoming new tool will let you completely turn off comments on individual posts.
* As reported by The New York Times this morning and confirmed by Instagram itself, in addition to being able to turn off comments on individual posts users will be also permitted to remove followers on private accounts and like other people’s comments as well.
* Back in September, Instagram launched keyword-based comment moderation as another measure to fight spammers and abusers who have been harassing honest users with unwanted comments and marketing messages.
* “Sometimes there may be moments when you want to let your post stand on its own,” said Instagram. To turn off comments for a specific story, tap Advanced Settings before you post and then select Turn Off Commenting.
* You can also tap the ellipsis menu any time after posting to turn commenting back on. This feature used to be limited to a small number of accounts, but Instagram has now promised to roll it to everyone “in a few weeks”.

* Also launching in the coming weeks: the ability to like comments by tapping a heart icon next to any comment. And in addressing an issue that prevented you from undoing approving a follower without blocking them, you can now remove followers provided your Instagram account is set to private: in your list of followers, tap the … menu next to a person’s name (they won’t be notified that you removed them as a follower).
* Lat but not least, the company is expanding privacy options by making it easier for users to access Instagram’s support options within the app and reporting anonymously friends who may be thinking about injuring themselves.

* Instagram will connect people in a need to organizations that offer help. “We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to review these reports,“ said the firm.
