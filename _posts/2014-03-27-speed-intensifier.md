* Speed Intensifier is a tweak that’s been around for some time, but was just recently updated to play nice with iOS 7 and arm64 devices like the iPhone 5s. The effect, especially when you take into consideration the drastic animation changes present within iOS 7, is nothing short of startling.
* If you’re looking to speed up, at least in perception, the speed of your device, then look no further. Speed Intensifier allows you to significantly increase the speed of animations found within iOS 7, and it does so while allowing you to keep iOS 7’s trademarked style. Check out our full video walkthrough inside, which showcases Speed Intensifier in action.
* Once you install Speed Intensifier, head over to the stock Settings app and open up the tweak’s preferences. Inside the preferences, you’ll find a section for custom speed. The custom speed section has several settings, ranging from zero all the way up to infinite—the faster speed possible.

* The animation speed changes are enacted in real time, so no resprings are required. I find that the x5 speed is a comfortable animation speed to go with, while the infinite setting is mind-boggingly fast. In fact, the infinite speed is probably way too fast for most tastes, and makes it so that the animations within iOS 7, which are useful for gaining context, are virtually nonexistent.

* The last setting you’ll find within Speed Intensifier’s preferences, is a toggle for keeping the wiggle mode animation normal, even when you have Speed Intensifier enabled. The wiggle mode is already fast with normal animation settings, so increasing its speed with Speed Intensifier can cause the wiggle animation to just freeze up completely. This toggle eliminates this issue while allowing you to enjoy the animation speed increases in other areas of iOS.
* Although I’m a firm believer that tweaks like this don’t really help you to work faster, there’s no denying that, at least from a perception standpoint, that Speed Intensifier speeds up your device. It makes it seem like your iPhone is supercharged and raring to go. It may be all in the mind, but who cares?
* Check out Speed Intensifier today on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. It’s a free download, so you really have no excuse not to try it. Once you take it for a test drive, be sure to let us know how you fared down below in the comments.
