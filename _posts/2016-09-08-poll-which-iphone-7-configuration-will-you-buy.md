* There are two new iPhones in Apple’s iPhone lineup: the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Both are power-houses, but each has its differences. With that in mind, we’re curious about what iPhone configuration you’re planning to buy.
* There are a lot of factors related to the type of iPhone you’re planning on buying, including the size, storage option, and color. So we’ve embedded three separate polls in this post so you can be heard.
* It should be interesting to see what the most popular outcome is going to be.
* Will you get the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus?
* What finish will you get?
* What storage size are you going to get?
* Note: Keep in mind that the Jet Black color option for the iPhone 7 is not available in a 32GB storage option like the other colors are.
* Personally, I will probably be going with a 128GB Jet black iPhone 7 Plus. I like the new color a lot, and I’m more of a fan of the camera features on the larger model. Unfortunately, because Apple won’t offer a 32GB option for the Jet Black color, I’m pigeon-holed into buying the higher-tier storage option.
* Let us know what you chose and why in the comments below!
