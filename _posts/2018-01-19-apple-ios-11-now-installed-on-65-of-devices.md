* That number is up 6 percentage points since the last update was given in December of last year, where it came in at 59%. As for older versions of iOS, Apple says that iOS 10 is still installed on 28% of compatible devices, and just 7% of devices are on iOS 9 and older.
* True, iOS 11 adoption is growing slower than iOS 10—it was at 76% adoption this time last year—but it’s still moving significantly faster than Android. According to recent data, the adoption rate of the last 3 versions of Android combined is only at 56%.
