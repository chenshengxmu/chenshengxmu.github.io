* The first beta of watchOS 5 is plagued by installation issues that could brick Apple Watch devices so Apple’s decided to pull the software from its Dev Center portal for developers.
* According to Reddit posters, some people have experienced an unexpected freeze halfway through their watchOS 5 installation, rendering their device inoperable. The problem appears to be particularly pronounced on Apple Watch Series 2 models.
* This issue cannot be resolved without contacting AppleCare.
* Until this issue is resolved, the watchOS 5 beta will remain unavailable. As a precaution, Apple has already pulled both the over-the-air watchOS 5 beta 1 installer and the appropriate configuration profile from its portal for developers until they get to the bottom of this.
* “Seed 1 of watchOS 5 is temporarily unavailable,” reads a message on Dev Center. “We are investigating an issue that occurs while updating. If you’ve experienced any issues, please contact AppleCare.”
* We’ll make sure to let you know when the beta returns.
