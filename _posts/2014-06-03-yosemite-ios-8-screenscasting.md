* Capturing a real-time screencast of apps and games running on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad used to require juggling with various devices/cables.
* As our own Jeff Benjamin would explain, a typical solution would involve using a pro camcorder to physically record the screen of an iOS device and taking advantage of one of Lightning digital A/V adapters to feed live video from your iOS device to a computer or a specialized video capture device.
* Starting this Fall, iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite will greatly simplify the process by allowing you to capture a screencast by connecting an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad to a computer using a Lightning cable, no A/V adapters or HDMI capture cards needed whatsoever…
* It’s real easy, as explained by Benjamin Mayo.
* You just hook up an iOS 8 device to a computer using a Lightning cable and it will show up as a video input source in QuickTime. You can then use QuickTime to capture anything you’re doing on-screen and store it as a video file to your Mac.
* Apple confirms:
* With iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, you can capture real-time footage of your app directly off your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.
* Just connect your device to your Mac using the Lightning connector and it will be automatically available as a video camera.
* Screencasts are especially relevant in light of the App Store improvements Apple mentioned yesterday, including so-called App Previews.
* Basically, App Previews stand for device-captured promotional footage “showcasing what’s great about your app to help users decide if it’s right for them”.
* Developers can start uploading their App Previews to iTunes Connect this Fall.
* Just like screenshots, Apple will review these videos and include a single App Preview per each app, alongside screenshots in the App Store on iOS 8 or later.
* Apple explains:
* • Just like screenshots, each App Preview is device specific. • Submitting or viewing App Previews requires an iPhone or iPod touch with a 4 inch Retina display or iPad. • You may only submit a single set of App Previews designed for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad against one language localization. App Previews will appear in all countries where your app is available.
* It’s going to be a killer feature for games makers, I’m sure.
* If you’re jailbroken, there are jailbreak tweaks specifically dedicated to recording a live iOS device screencast via AirPlay Mirroring.
