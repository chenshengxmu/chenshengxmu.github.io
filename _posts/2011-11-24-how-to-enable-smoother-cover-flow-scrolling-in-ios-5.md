* Cover Flow has always been more eye candy than it is useful, but the usefulness it did have has always been hindered by its lagginess.
* SmoothCoverFlow is a free jailbreak tweak available on Cydia that aims to eliminate the choppy feel that you get when scrolling through a large Cover Flow library. Does it work? Check out our video demonstration inside for the answer…
* Indeed, SmoothCoverFlow works just as stated, eliminating virtually all choppiness present prior to the tweak’s installation.
* I’m not sure what the tweak changes, but the change is certainly for the better, and hopefully Apple’s engineers are taking notes.
* SmoothCoverFlow can be download for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo if you have a jailbroken iDevice running iOS 5.
* Have you tried it out yet? Did you notice a reduction in lag?
