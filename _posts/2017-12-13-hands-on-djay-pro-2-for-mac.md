* Algoriddim yesterday released its djay Pro 2 for Mac, a major release bringing, aside from other enhancements and new features, a brand new AI-driven Automix mode that works like magic.
* Automix AI allows for seamless cross-genre mixes with varying tempo.
* This powerful new feature was trained using real sets from human DJs to intelligently detect rhythmic patterns and the best intro and outro sections of a song. By calculating optimal fade durations, Automix AI then adjusts equalizers and filters in real time to achieve seamless transitions.
* By default, Automix AI uses the Morph effect to ensure a song’s BPM is maintained during a transition. Needless to say, you can choose between other effects at any time.
* Check out Automix AI in action in our hands-on video embedded below.

* Andrew also mentions other enhancements in djay Pro 2, like a redesigned interface, new organizational features, beat-matched photo visualization, enhanced Spotify integration, as well as new beats, samples and other in-app content.
* The best way to enjoy Automix AI is to create a custom playlist beforehand. Then, lean back and enjoy your Automix with on-the-fly manual control and the ability to change the source music at any time.
* If you use Spotify, Automix AI even allows you to take advantage of Spotify’s song-recommendation engine, called Match, in order to supply a continuous queue of songs for auto-mixing, based on parameters like danceability, BPM, key and music style.

* You can even watch the knobs turning as Automix AI does its magic.
* This feature is especially great for those times when you need to take a short break in between sets or simply want to enjoy your custom playlist with seamless transitions.
* djay Pro 2 is compatible with any Mac running macOS El Capitan 10.11 or later. A Spotify Premium subscription is required to access the Spotify music catalog from within the app.
* djay Pro 2 for Mac is $39.99 on Mac App Store, but the standard price will be $49.99 after the sale ends. A free trial of the app can be downloaded from the Algoriddim website.
