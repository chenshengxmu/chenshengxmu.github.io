* The Unicode Consortium, the organization which develops the Unicode standard that specifies the representation of text in all modern software, officially announced Unicode 9.0, the next major revision to the Unicode standard.
* The Unicode 9.0 specification is now available to vendors with 7,500 new characters for a total of 128,172 characters, including six new scripts and 72 new emoji characters.
* “Unicode 9.0 adds several characters intended to complete gender pairs, and there are ongoing efforts to provide more gender choices in the future,” reads the post. Among other important symbol additions, Unicode 9.0 includes nineteen new symbols for the new 4K TV standard.
* Unicode 9.0 also adds variation sequences for every emoji character with a default text presentation and two new mechanisms for globally controlling the emoji presentation: using language tags with locale extensions and using special script codes.
* “Though these are new mechanisms and not yet widely supported, vendors are encouraged to support the locale extension for most general usage such as in browsers,” writes the organization.
* The 72 new emojis in Unicode 9.0 are as follows:
* It’s interesting that a “rifle” emoji and a “modern pentathlon” one were excluded from Unicode 9.0 over objections from Apple and other members of the Unicode Consortium voting committee.
* Apple’s software platforms currently include Unicode 8.0 emojis. The 72 new emoji added to the just-released Unicode 9.0 standard should be deployed across iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10 and watchOS 3 when they release this fall.
* The new scripts and characters in Unicode 9.0 add support for lesser-used languages:
