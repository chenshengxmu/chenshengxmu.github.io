* Remember that beautiful, one-of-a-kind red Mac Pro designed by Apple’s Jony Ive and Marc Newson we told you about last month? Well it and several other items designed by the pair sold this weekend at their Sotheby’s (RED) Auction in New York.
* And as with most high-profile charity auctions, the selling prices for most of these items were pretty ridiculous. The Mac Pro, for example, was expected to sell for between $40,000 and $60,000, but it ended up selling for just shy of a million dollars…

* Here are the selling prices for some of the more popular items from the auction (via 9to5Mac):
* The sale total from the auction was a staggering $12,883,000 (US).
* The good news is that all (or most of) this money is going to charity. Ive and Newson are donating the proceeds from the auction to the (Product) RED, an organization that fights preventable and treatable diseases like AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
