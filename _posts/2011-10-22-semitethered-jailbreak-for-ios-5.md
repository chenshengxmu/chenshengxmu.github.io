* What’s the next best thing to an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5? A Semitethered Jailbreak of course!
* Just a few minutes ago BigBoss released Semitethered Jailbreak, a new Cydia package that lets you reboot your iOS 5 jailbroken iPhone at will while away from your computer!
* It’s not without it’s caveats, but it’s a whole lot better than a normal tethered jailbreak. Details inside…
* Step 1: Tether Jailbreak your iOS 5 device with RedSn0w.
* Step 2: Add http://thebigboss.org/semitether to your Cydia sources.
* Step 3: Install SemiTether and reboot!
* Note: You can also follow our full video tutorial, here.
* That’s it. Now you can reboot your iPhone, even away from your computer!
* As mentioned, there are a few pluses and minuses though.
* That’s a pretty good compromise, and sure beats having a looping apple logo if your phone happens to crash or reboot while away from the computer.
* Let’s just call it really good jailbreak life insurance, shall we? Video coming shortly!
* Have you used Semitethered Jailbreak yet? Are you excited?
