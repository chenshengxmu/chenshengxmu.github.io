* Bad news for would-be jailbreakers of iOS 8.2 beta 1 or beta 2—both firmwares are no longer being signed. There seems to be conflicting reports going around about whether or not Apple has killed access to beta 1, beta 2, or both beta firmwares, but I can personally confirm that Apple has shut down access to both.
* Why is this significant? It’s significant because iOS 8.2 beta 1 and beta 2 were the only firmwares available that allowed users to jailbreak using PP Jailbreak on Mac or TaiG on Windows.
* So what to do now? The only option right now is to wait it out. There are rumors flying around that TaiG may be holding on to an iOS 8.2 jailbreak, and if the past six months are indicative of anything, I’d say that that’s a distinct possibility.
* Reports are stating that Apple may drop iOS 8.2 this Monday, so I guess we will see whether or not the TaiG iOS 8.2 jailbreak rumors are true sooner than later.
* Obviously, if you’re on iOS 8.1.2, or iOS 8.2 beta 1 or 2, you want to stay right where you are. If you’ve updated to iOS 8.1.3, you’re going to have to wait it out for a while.
* What’s your current iOS 8 firmware status? Are you currently jailbroken? Share your experiences down below in the comments section.
