* After seeding iOS 9.3.3 beta 2 and OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 beta 2 to the registered members of the Apple Developer Program yesterday, these new betas are now available to public beta testers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program.
* Public beta testers can apply these updates through the Software Update mechanism on devices enrolled into the Beta program that run a prior iOS/OS X beta.
* These new betas don’t provide any new user-facing features as Apple is getting ready to preview the next major versions of its software platforms at WWDC next week.
* iOS 9.3.3 beta 2 comes with a build number of “13G21” while OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 beta 2 has a build number “15G12a”. In addition, Apple yesterday also seeded tvOS 9.2.2 beta 2 (build “13Y816”) and watchOS 2.2.2 beta (build “13V601”).
* watchOS and tvOS betas are not currently available for public beta testing.
