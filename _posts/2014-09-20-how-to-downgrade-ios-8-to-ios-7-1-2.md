* If you’re interested in downgrading your iOS device from iOS 8 back to iOS 7.1.2, you can still do so for a limited time. Obviously, your device must be capable of running iOS 7.1.2 in the first place, so devices like the newly released iPhone 6 and its larger brethren, the 6 Plus, do not qualify.
* Downgrades are only possible when Apple is signing the firmware that you wish to downgrade to. Traditionally, Apple is fairly fast with its cutoff point, as it usually stops signing firmware that’s not the current release, in short order.
* As of this post, Apple is still signing iOS 7.1.2, so if you wish to downgrade, you better act fast. Inside, we’ll walk you through downgrading to iOS 7.1.2 on an iPhone 5s, but the same rules apply to any device that is currently running iOS 8, but is capable of running iOS 7.1.2.
* Step 1: Download the iOS 7.1.2 firmware for your device via our download page.
* Step 2: Turn off Find My iPhone on your device if you have it enabled. Go to Settings → iCloud, and disable the Find My iPhone switch.
* Step 3: Connect your device to a Mac with iTunes installed.
* Step 4: Open the device page on iTunes, and hold the Option key while clicking the Restore button. Find the IPSW firmware file that you downloaded in Step 1, select it, and click Open.
* Step 5: A pop-up box will warn you that the restore will delete all data from the device. If you are okay with the restore, click the Restore button. Wait until your device restores, and enjoy your iOS 7.1.2 firmware.
* Again, this is valid for a finite amount of time. At any point in the coming hours, days, or weeks, Apple will stop signing iOS 7.1.2, and you will not be able to downgrade.
* If you’re planning on downgrading, please let us know why, down below in the comments.
