* Every once in a while the Auto-Lock setting on my iPhone would get stuck on thirty seconds even though I clearly remember setting it to 1 minute. And occasionally, I can’t change the timing for the automatic lock feature in Settings → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock because the option appears greyed out.
* Has that happened to you in the past? If so, proceed reading this article to learn about a remarkable simple fix for this issue and learn what’s causing it.
* This is what I’m talking about.

* If the Auto-Lock options is greyed out on your device, too, that’s because your iPhone is in Low Power Mode. “When in Low Power Mode, Auto-Lock is restricted to 30 seconds” to help conserve power, according to the official description which appears when the device is in Low Power Mode.

* When Low Power Mode is off, you can interact with Auto-Lock settings. To turn Low Power Mode on and off, go to Settings → Battery and flip the Low Power Mode toggle.
* Your iPhone also enters Low Power Mode when the battery level falls below the twenty percent mark so keep that in mind, too.

* In addition to enforcing the 30-second Auto-Lock option, Low Power Mode also enables manual fetching for Mail, disables automatic downloads and background app refreshes, throttles your CPU, reduces network speed and disables motion—all in the name of extending your run time.
* You’ll know Low Power Mode is active when the battery icon in iOS’s status bar changes to a yellow color.
