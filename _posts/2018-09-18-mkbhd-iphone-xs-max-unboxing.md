* Apple’s new phones put iPhone X design in a trio of form factors, and our friend MKBHD has unboxed the regular iPhone Xs and a device that’ll be on many wish lists, a gold-colored iPhone Xs Max with half a terabyte storage and a massive 6.5-inch OLED display.
* For those wondering, this flagship iPhone will set you back $1,449 before tax.
* But first, watch the unboxing.
* There isn’t much to see in terms of user experience or the feel of wielding a 6.5-inch fullscreen smartphone in one’s hand. For that, we’ll have to wait until MKBHD’s in-depth review arrives.
* That’s right, you read that right.
* The iPhone 6s and iPhone SE lines were the last Apple smartphones that featured a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack, but those models are no longer available because Appel quietly killed them off after announcing the latest models for 2018.
* “All this previous iPhones with no headphone jacks have always come with the little Lightning to headphone jack dongle in the box—very considerate,” he said. “This year it’s gone.”

* Where did the headphone jack dongle go?
* “If you’re buying a thousand-dollar phone, or even a $1,450 phone like we have here, you wouldn’t blink twice at buying a little eight-dollar adapter,” MKBHD continued.
* “It’s clearly done on purpose,” he uttered the same thought that was on our mind, too.
* “Apple can afford to put the dongle in there, but they choose not to this time trying to nudge people again towards wireless headphones.”
* The irony of this?
* The best-selling product in Apple Store, by volume, for the last two years: dongles.
* Here are some additional highlights:
* We’ve partnered with MKBHD on two sets of branded wallpapers for Apple devices.
* I use my AirPods all the time and love them a lot so I don’t mind that Apple hasn’t included that headphone jack adapter in the box. As a matter of fact, I cannot honestly remember if I have ever used the adapter that came with my iPhone 7.
* TUTORIAL: How to fast charge your iPhone
* To me, the major issue is the fact that Apple is acting like a cheapskate when it comes to fast charging. iPhones have long supported faster charging via the 10W or 12W iPad brick. iPhones from iPhone 7 onward have included a handy fast-charging feature that takes the battery from dead to 50% in 30 minutes.
* To take advantage of fast charging, however, customers must spend an extra $68 just because Apple in its great wisdom chose not to include a USB-C power brick and a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. This exclusion is patently Apple—they don’t include a wireless charger either.
* ROUNDUP: The best fast-charge USB-C power bricks for your iPhone
* The 5W bricks included in the boxes with the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xr models still support just 1A. In case you’re wondering, you need a USB-C cable and a USB Power Delivery-compatible 15-watt or stronger power adapter to fast charge an iPhone.
* A rumor said Apple would ditch its proprietary Lightning connector from 2019 iPhone and replace it with the industry-standard USB-C port, which might explain why there’s no fast-charge equipment in your iPhone box.
* If it’s any consolation, you do get a faster Qi wireless charging with the latest iPhones.
* So, boys and girls, what do you make of MKBHD’s unboxing video?
