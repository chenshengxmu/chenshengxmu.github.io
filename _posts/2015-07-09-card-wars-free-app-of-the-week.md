* Apple has just named Cartoon Network’s “Card Wars – Adventure Time Card Game” its App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to download the card combat game for free—a solid savings of $4.
* In Card Wars, players are tasked with commanding an army of awesome warriors to destroy their opponent’s forces. You can collect new cards to level up your creatures, spells and towers, or choose to fuse them together to make them more powerful.

* From Apple’s Editors’ Notes:
* Play a real-life version of the Adventure Time gang’s favorite pastime in this fast-paced, easy-to-learn card battler. Defend your territory against characters from the show, commanding monsters and unleashing spells in a campaign full of zany animation and hilarious voice acting. Under the silly surface, powerful strategic options and deck-building features deliver a delightfully deep experience.
* Here’s a video of the game in action:
* Even if you’re not a fan of the Adventure Time show, or you’ve never seen it, there’s enough depth and features here to make this game enjoyable—provided you don’t mind a little crude humor. At the very least, I suggest picking this up for a rainy day.
* You can find Card Wars – Adventure Time Card Game in the App Store for free.
