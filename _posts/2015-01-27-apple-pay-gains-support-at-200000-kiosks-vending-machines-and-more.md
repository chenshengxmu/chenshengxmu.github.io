* USA Technologies announced on Tuesday that it will be bringing Apple Pay support to 200,000 acceptance points, which includes owners and operators of coffee brewers, vending machines, kiosks, laundry equipment, parking pay stations and other self-serve appliances.
* USA Technologies is a company behind payment technology all over the country. It began building NFC capabilities into its cashless payment products and services approximately ten years ago, and sees Apple Pay’s NFC capability worthy of support.
* It could be the boost Apple Pay needs for customers to use it in their daily lives, and in turn, push Apple Pay over Google Wallet and other mobile payment solutions. USA Technologies represents a lot of smaller ticket items.
* “Our customers are excited to accept Apple Pay at the self-serve locations they operate,” Stephen Herbert, Chairman and CEO of USA Technologies, said. “We anticipate that the millions of consumers who frequent these locations will appreciate the convenience and security of using Apple Pay for their everyday purchases, and we believe that Apple Pay will help to drive additional sales for our customers.”
* Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on the company’s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday that $2 out of every $3 spent using contactless payments are being made with Apple Pay at the big name banks. Furthermore, 750 banks and credit unions are now supporting Apple Pay.
