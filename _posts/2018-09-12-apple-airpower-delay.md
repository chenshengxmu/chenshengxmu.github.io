* Apple never announced a launch date for the AirPower wireless charger. However, it’s probably safe to assume no one at the company figured it would still be missing in action one year after it was first teased. Now, despite a rumor to the contrary, the folks over at MacRumors are now suggesting the device won’t be released after today’s event,
* The AirPower was first announced on Sept. 12, 2017, and was designed to inductively charge multiple Apple devices at once, including many that were also announced on that date, such as the third-generation Apple Watch, iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus.
* Exactly one year later, Apple has yet to release the AirPower.
* Back in June, Bloomberg said Apple planned on releasing the wireless device before the end of September. Next-generation AirPods, which were also teased last year, includes a case that’s also designed to work with the AirPower. It too was expected to launch after Apple’s event today.
* As MacRumors rightly pointed out, besides not mentioning new iPad Pro tablets and Macs, the leaked Apple product sitemap highlighted earlier today also didn’t have anything to say about the AirPower and next-generation AirPods. In other words, neither product is probably going to be mentioned at today’s “Gather round” event that begins at 10 a.m. PDT.
* In Bloomberg’s June post, it said continued problems with AirPower’s multi-device charging mechanism was the reason for the device’s long delay. That could certainly still be the case. Still, one has to wonder who’s idea it was to announce the product in the first place given its complexity.
* Hopefully, we’ll hear something about both products soon.
* You can stream today’s event live on Twitter, Apple TV, and through a web browser. Come back to iDB for updates and analysis.
