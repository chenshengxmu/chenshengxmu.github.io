* For weeks, Pebble has been hinting that it had a big announcement coming up at CES, and today it finally let the cat out of the bag. The smartwatch-maker unveiled its next generation wearable, the Pebble Steel, with an all-new band and face design.
* The Steel features a stainless steel body with a leather or steel band—a huge upgrade from the plastic used in the previous model— and a face covered with Gorilla Glass. The new Pebble is lighter, and has a thinner profile thanks to slimmer bezels…
* Why Pebble Steel? CEO Eric Migicovsky explains to CNET:
* “CEO Eric Migicovsky describes Steel as a more formal version of Pebble: “I’m going out for dinner, I’m wearing a suit, I’ve got a position that doesn’t allow me to wear a plastic watch on my wrist. How do I benefit from a smartwatch? How do I get notifications and run all the apps that Pebble offers without having to put something that I don’t prefer on my wrist. We took that as an industrial design problem. It wasn’t really a software problem…We just had to build an aesthetically different Pebble.” 
* In addition to brushed stainless steel, the band is also available in matte black steel, and of course black leather. The Steel can last for up to a week on a single charge and there’s an LED indicator for battery life. And like the first Pebble, it’s waterproof.

* I have to say, the new Pebble looks a lot better than the previous version, but other than appearance, I don’t think there are many differences between the two. It appears to use the same E-ink display, and looks like it runs the same 3rd-party apps.
* The Steel will begin shipping on January 28 for $249, a $100 more than the current model, and you can pre-order it today. Pebble also announced that its app store will be available this month with high profile launch partners like ESPN and Mercedes.
