* HomePod, Apple’s Siri-powered wireless speaker, won’t be arriving next month after all.
* The company told CNBC on Friday that it’s delaying the HomePod launch until next year.
* “We can’t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple’s breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it’s ready for our customers,” Apple said.
* “We’ll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia in early 2018,” it added.
* Apple’s employees in China and California have been testing HomePod for weeks now. Apple has also released a few HomePod firmware updates.
* HomePod is compatible with iPhone 5s and later, running iOS 11.
* Originally announced during WWDC in June, the $349 wireless speaker was supposed to land on store shelves in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia this December ahead of the important holiday shopping season before seeing a wider rollout across 2018.

* Before HomePod, Apple also delayed AirPods last year, arguing it doesn’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready whilst providing the same “need a little more time” explanation.
* Were you planning on buying HomePod next month? And, would you still be willing to get one now that you know it’s been delayed until some time in 2018?
* Sound off in the comments!
