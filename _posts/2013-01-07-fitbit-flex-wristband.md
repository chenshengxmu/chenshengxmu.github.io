* Looking to one-up Jawbone’s Up wristband, Fitbit today at CES unveiled a new fitness-tracking accessory for your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, the Flex. This tiny tracker fits comfortably around your wrist and arrives as the first wristband on the market to sync with low-power Bluetooth Smart devices.
* It has a built-in battery that last up to seven days and will track steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned and even figure your sleeping habits…
* Upon syncing your data, the Fitbit dashboard app for iOS and Android drills through it with graphs and tools like leaderboard, badges and so forth. Specifically, you can use the software to set your goals, see stats updated, and track progress when you’re out and about. The app also uploads data to your free account up in the Fitbit cloud.
* The wristband will send notifications to your device wirelessly when you’re close to your goals in order to keep you motivated. Another nice touch: it’s got LED indicator lights “that give you immediate feedback on your progress to a goal throughout the day”.
* This being a Bluetooth 4.0 accessory, it requires an iPhone 4S/5, iPad 3/4, fifth-gen iPod touch or select Android devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy S III or Note II.
* A QuickTime video of the product is available here.
* Features include:
* Know your stats: Tracks steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutes
* Getting good ZZZs: Tracks quality of sleep (# of hours, how many times you wake up, sleep efficiency index) and uses a silent alarm that vibrates to wake you up gently
* First and only wristband to: Sync to select mobile devices via Bluetooth 4.0 (first all-day wristband tracker to offer this capability). It also syncs wirelessly and automatically to your computer.
* Multi-platform: Syncs to select iPhone and, now, select Android devices
* With you all the time: Comfortable enough to wear all day. Water-resistant. Wear it in the shower.
* Match your mood or personality: Flexible, interchangeable tracker with a variety of colorful wristbands (Black, Slate, Teal, Tangerine, Navy)
* Rich mobile and online offerings: iPhone and Android App and Online tools – shows activity charts, leaderboards and more. Set goals, view progress and earn badges.
* Social motivation: Connect with friends and family for support or friendly competition
* Even more health and fitness tools: Log food, weight and more on Fitbit’s website or apps
* If you’re into monitoring your lifestream, this thing is worth a look.
* Fitbit released other life tracking products in 2012, including the Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale, Fitbit Zip and Fitbit One Wireless Activity + Sleep Trackers.
* The Flex is available in a range of colors (black, slate, teal, tangerine and navy) and is available for pre-order starting today over at the Fitbit web store.
* It’s gonna run you $99.95 a piece and will ship in Spring 2013.
