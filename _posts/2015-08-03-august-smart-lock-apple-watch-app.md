* The popular Smart Lock accessory by August now makes it easy to lock and unlock your door right from your wrist with a brand new Apple Watch app, announced Monday.
* Available as a free update to the existing iPhone application, the WatchKit component provides an Apple Watch app and a glance which can be used to operate your August Smart Lock and view its logs, view your most recent activity, receive instant notifications and more.
* If you own a Smart Lock by August (purchase it on Amazon.com) and have the latest August Smart Lock for iOS app installed on your device, you’ll be able to lock or unlock your Smart Lock from your wearable device with a swipe and a tap.
* This is another useful feature the Apple Watch app provides. By providing access to a log of your Smart Lock’s most recent activity on your wrist, it’s easy to see if someone has entered or exited your home and when, without taking your iPhone out of your pocket.
* In addition to locking and unlocking your Smart Lock and checking out its most recent activity, the Apple Watch app will show you real-time notifications when your door is unlocked, so you can act swiftly if someone is trying to break into your home.
* Like any other app for the wearable device, installing August Smart Lock on your Apple Watch is a simple matter of downloading the most recent version from the App Store and turning on the Show App on Apple Watch and Glances switches inside the August section in the Apple Watch companion app on your iPhone.
* The 22-megabyte app requires an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab August Smart Lock free in the App Store.
