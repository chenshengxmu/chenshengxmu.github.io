* Apple is in the early stages of building its long-rumored television set, working with glassmaker Corning, Foxconn, G-Tech Optoelectronics, Foxconn, and Innolux, according to a new report out of Taiwan this morning.
* Citing supply chain sources, the outlet says that the companies all met two weeks ago in the US to discuss the production of Apple’s so-called iTV. The set will come in 55″ and 60″ models, and be available early next year…
* From Economic Daily News (via MacRumors):
* “According to sources in the industry, Apple, Corning, Foxconn, and G-Tech Optoelectronics met two weeks ago in US to discuss the production of iTV. Foxconn is seeking for knowledge transfer of Gorilla Glass from Corning to GTOC, so GTOC can perform surface treatments needed for iTV manufacturing.
* iTV is scheduled for release during the first half of 2014. 55″ and 60″ models will be released first, and will incorporate panels from Sakai City, Japan. Due to the weakening relationship between Foxconn and Sharp, Foxconn may eventually turn to Innolux to fulfill the large quantity of display panels needed for iTV orders.”
* Economic Daily News has had a mixed track record in predicting Apple’s future product plans. But it did correctly name 2 iPad mini display suppliers in advance, so it does appear to have solid sources in the panel industry.
* Rumors of an Apple-branded television have been bouncing around for years now, with the latest chatter suggesting that the company is in talks with LG Display and other panel suppliers in search of 4K Ultra HD screens.
* But there’s also been talk of Apple forgoing a TV set in favor of an advanced set-top box. Earlier today, a report surfaced claiming that it could be looking to make a TV-related announcement as early as November this year.
