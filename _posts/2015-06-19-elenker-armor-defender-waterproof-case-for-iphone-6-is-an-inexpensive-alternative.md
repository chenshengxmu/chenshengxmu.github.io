* When it comes to waterproof cases for the iPhone 6, we are often faced with spending a lot more than we want to for solid protection. Either that, or we are stuck with the pouch style option, which works great, but doesn’t look as good.
* Elenker’s Armor Defender is a low-cost waterproof case that protects your iPhone 6 underwater, in a sandstorm, and while skiing down the mountainside. Plus, it has a handy kickstand so you can prop it up while lounging poolside.
* The case is made from hard polycarbonate material for durable protection against drops and other accidents. It is waterproof rated for 6.6 feet deep for up to 30 minutes. The touch sensitive clear screen cover allows for use with the iPhone’s screen. It has a special Touch ID compatible membrane covering the Home button. The back-facing camera cover features a double AR-coated optical glass lens for clear pictures.
* The backside of the case features a flip out kickstand so you can set up your iPhone 6 in landscape mode for watching movies or other relaxing activities while sipping margaritas by the pool.
* Elenker’s Armor Defender for iPhone 6 only costs $10 on Amazon. There is a version for the iPhone 6 Plus for $15.
