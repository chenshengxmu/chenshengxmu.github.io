* After sharing blurry photographs of the supposed plastic iPhone 5C showing the devices’s packaging and printed manual, the same Chinese source is back at it and now has posted a pair of new images. The photos appear to picture the blue, white and yellow iPhone 5C units in their boxes and a close-up shot of the blue iPhone 5C.
* The latter is especially interesting as we’re treated to a nice scene of the device’s supposedly rounded edges, part of its Unibody enclosure in matte finish. It’s quite compelling, have a look below…
* Top of post: the cheery pastel hues of blue and yellow, and white. I’m loving the iPod touch-style boxes.
* Right below: the blue iPhone 5C closeup.
* The two images were posted by the Chinese blog iapps.im.

* Note the Lumia-esque fit and finish and general hints of the Lumia 620 design.
* It’s interesting that the images appeared briefly online before being taken down at the request “of a relevant party”, via CNET. The same website over the weekend shared the following images allegedly representing the supposed iPhone 5C packaging and a Quick Start guide.

* Color-matched wallpapers seem to be a thing.

* Earlier today, the Chinese technology blog C Technology published the first video  believed to depict the fully assembled iPhone 5C, powered on and running the stock iOS 7 Safari browser. The same website additionally shared the shot below of a green iPhone 5C in its packaging.

* Apple’s plastic iPhone 5C is expected to be introduced alongside the iPhone 5S at a media event on September 10, with availability pegged at September 20. The $300-$400 device should include most of the iPhone 5’s internals, re-packaged inside a polycarbonate plastic body.
* Moreover, the iPhone 5C is expected to phase out the iPhone 5, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
* So, what do you guys think?
