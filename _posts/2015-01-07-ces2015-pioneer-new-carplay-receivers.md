* Shortly after Kenwood went head to head with Pioneer with its own aftermarket receivers with CarPlay integration, the company responded by announcing a second-generation Networked Entertainment eXperience (NEX) in-dash receivers with CarPlay support.
* Building on the features introduced in the previous NEX series (the $1400 AVIC-8000NEX, $1200 AVIC-7000NEX, $900 AVIC-6000NEX, $750 AVIC-5000NEX and $700 AVH-4000NEX), the updated receivers offer better displays, support for Bluetooth connectivity and are Sirius XM-Ready.
* Consisting of the $1,400 AVIC-8100NEX, $1,200 AVIC-7100NEX, $900 AVIC-6100NEX, $750 AVIC-5100NEX and $700 AVH-4100NEX, these new in-dash receivers support both Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, giving users the freedom to use their device in the car regardless of their smartphone platform of choice.
* The upgraded models also offer Pioneer’s AppRadio Mode, MirrorLink compatibility, Pandora internet radio, iDatalink Maestro support and FLAC audio file playback (up to 192kHz/24 bit).

* CarPlay is supported across all models while Android Auto is supported on the AVIC-8100NEX, AVIC-7100NEX and AVH-4100NEX. The top-of-the-line AVIC-8100NEX offers a capacitive WVGA touchscreen display, with the remaining models sporting an improved clear resistive WVGA touch panel that provides brighter, more vibrant colors and increased touch sensitivity.
* The AVIC-8100NEX, AVIC-7100NEX and AVH-4100NEX have seven-inch screens and the AVIC-6100NEX and AVIC-5100NEX feature a smaller 6.2 inch display sizes. Bluetooth connectivity has been improved by way of support for Bluetooth AVRCP 1.4 and HFP 1.6 with wideband audio for clearer sound quality.
* For those wondering, labeling a product as Sirius XM-Ready simply means that it provides fully integrated satellite radio experience. In practice, this means that after adding a compatible tuner to the receiver you’ll be able to use the receiver’s touchscreen to search and navigate SiriusXM.

* In addition to commercial-free music, SiriusXM’s premier sports and live events, comedy, news, exclusive talk and entertainment programming (subscription required) is received through the new SiriusXM SXV300 Connect Vehicle Tuner, sold separately, including:
* All models except the AVIC-5100NEX have built-in HD Radio for high quality audio broadcasts with the HD Radio Artist Experience providing information on the artist, song title, album art, station logos and more.
* The new receivers will be available in March.
