* As they said they would, the evad3rs have spoken out about the dramatic release of their evasi0n7 jailbreak earlier today. The jailbreak which was first welcome with open arms, was quickly seen as a greedy move from the evad3rs to make a quick buck through a deal with an unknown Chinese company that would facilitate piracy.
* Following conversations with reliable sources close to the evad3rs, we tried to clear up the confusion ourselves earlier today when we explained what Taig was and why the evad3rs released their jailbreak today.
* In a statement published on their website, the evad3rs give us the full story, greatly corroborating what we published ourselves earlier in the day…
* We handpicked a few pieces of the statement and turned them into digestible bullet points. We do suggest you go to the evad3rs’ site and read the full statement for the complete details:
* Again, please make sure to read the whole statement to get a better feel of their point of view.
