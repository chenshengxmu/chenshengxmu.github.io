* Looking to add some additional functionality to the iPhone’s volume HUD? If so, then you might want to take a look at HUD Pro — a new jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s MacCiti repo.
* At $1.50, I feel HUD Pro is a bit pricey for what it offers. It features things that venture more toward the gimmicky side than actually being useful, but perhaps this video will make it easier for you to decide on that…
* HUD Pro allows you to customize the HUD’s title and subtitle with things like date, time, battery life, and WiFi network name. There is even an option to add custom text to both fields.
* Along with the title and subtitles, you’ll find various Activator inspired gestures that can be performed directly on the HUD. These gestures allows you to lock your device, skip a now playing song, and various other miscellaneous functions.
* There are a few more arbitrary settings included with HUD Pro, but they become more gimmicky as you scroll down the list of options. Make no mistake, HUD Pro is an interesting tweak with a few neat features, but none of it is worth the $1.50 asking price.
* What do you think?
