* With the recent release of iOS 6, many jailbreakers have held back on the update so they can keep enjoying their favorite tweaks. Looking at conversations on iDB and Twitter, it appears that most jailbreakers are anxious to get on iOS 6, but not at the expense of their jailbreak. Those that find themselves in this situation are now patiently waiting for a jailbreak to be released.
* Though there is definitely encouraging news on the iOS 6 jailbreak front, an untethered jailbreak as yet to be released. Pouring some cold water on everybody’s hope, iOS hacker pod2g confirmed on Twitter today that he is not working on a jailbreak for iOS 6…
* Podg2, who’s mostly responsible for Absinthe iOS, the 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak, says he’s currently focusing on his job, but doesn’t discard any future involvement in an iOS 6 jailbreak, especially considering that JailbreakCon is right around the corner.
* Last week, iOS hacker and jailbreak developer Chpwn teased the world with a jailbroken iPhone 5. There is no indication at this time whether it is a tethered or untethered jailbreak. That’s about as much as we know so far.
* For more information about this topic, please make sure to check our jailbreak news archive, or our iOS 6 jailbreak tutorial.
* Cody and I will be at JailbreakCon this weekend, and we’ll make sure to let you know about any development.
