* The pocket edition of Minecraft is now available for the iPhone and iPad in the App Store. We told you that Minecraft was coming to the iOS platform a couple of months ago, and now it’s finally here.
* Fans of the popular game will be pleased to know that the iOS version looks and feels just like its desktop counterpart. Minecraft for iOS lacks online play support, but there’s still enough world-building fun to make it an attractive download.
* Imagine it, build it. Create worlds on the go with Minecraft – Pocket Edition
* Minecraft – Pocket Edition allows you to build on the go. Use blocks to create masterpieces as you travel, hangout with friends, sit at the park, the possibilities are endless. Move beyond the limits of your computer and play Minecraft everywhere you go.
* * Randomized worlds * Build anything you can imagine * Build with 36 different kinds of blocks * Invite and play with friends to your world (local wireless network) * Save multi-player worlds on your own phone
* Mincraft lets you build worlds made up of just about anything with all sorts of materials. While many of the game’s features are present in the iOS version, animals and creepers are not included in the gameplay. The app does have a multiplayer mode that lets you create worlds with friends on the same Wi-Fi network, which is fun.
