* Apple held a conference call yesterday, shortly after announcing its Q4 financial results.
* The results made interesting reading, with Apple falling just short of the expected revenue figure of $29.41 billion, making a not-inconsiderable $28.3 billion instead.
* The iPhone sold just 17.1 million units against the expected 22 million. But why such a difference between the two numbers, when the iPhone usually sells so strongly? According to Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer, the rumor mill is to blame…
* When asked why he thought the results were so disappointing, Oppenheimer suggested that the iPhone 5 rumors may be to blame for people deciding not to buy iPhones so close to a refresh. If you remember, many news outlets were predicting a new, teardrop-shaped design to be unveiled at Apple’s iPhone event. This, according to Oppenheimer, caused people to not purchase the iPhone 4.
* “Oppenheimer appears to be attributing at least part of the blame for poorer sales of the iPhone 4 on the rumors of a redesigned iPhone 5. “Apple’s secrecy creates a certain amount of vacuum, which, as we all know, the Internet abhors,” Oppenheimer said, “and then fills with rumors.”
* The claim makes even more sense when you consider the stellar sales figures coming from the iPhone 4S launch. Did people decide against buying an iPhone 4 with the expectation that Apple would make it obsolete soon after? While the iPhone 4S is indeed a new handset, and it does carry features the iPhone 4 does not, the differences between the two handsets are not as profound as the rumors suggested.
* So, there we have it folks: confirmation from Apple itself that our own expectations are to blame for its lower sales figures.
* Our bad, Apple!
