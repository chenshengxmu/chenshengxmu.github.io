* Black Friday is next week, and for those unfamiliar with the term, it’s the Friday after Thanksgiving that kicks off the busiest shopping weekend of the year. Retailers open their stores early and offer significant discounts on their products in hope of luring in holiday shoppers.
* And it looks like Apple will be participating in the festivities this year. While we haven’t yet received word on the company’s Black Friday deals, it does appear that many of its retail stores in both the United States and Canada will be opening early to accomodate the crowds…

* While it looks like my local Apple Store will only be opening up 2 hours early, there are some in the US that will be opening up as early as 6 am. Obviously you’ll want to check out Apple’s Retail Store Locations page (via MacRumors) to see what time your local store is opening.
* Apple’s Black Friday sales are usually more tame than other retailers. For instance, last year it only took $101 off select Mac computers, and $40-$60 off its iPads, while Best Buy and other chains offered discounts of nearly twice that. But obviously that could well change this year.
