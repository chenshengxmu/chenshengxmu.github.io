title: More Lines in Notification Center- Read Entire Messages Directly From Notification Center
---

* By default, Notification Center only displays 4 lines of text in any of your messages. This is okay, but for longer messages like email, it forces you to open the message to read its entire contents.
* With More Lines in Notification Center, a jailbreak tweak available on Cydia, you can display up to 12 lines of text at a time, which is usually enough to read the body of an entire (moderately sized) email or text message…
* I reviewed a similar tweak a while back entitled NotificationCenter Enhancer. By and large, that tweak did the same thing, but the difference is that this one is free.
* If you have a jailbroken device, and you want to check it out for yourself, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download it for free.
* Do you think this tweak is useful, or do you prefer to just open the full message in its native app?
