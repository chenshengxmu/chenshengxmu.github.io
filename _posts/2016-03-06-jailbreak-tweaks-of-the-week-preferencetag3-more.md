* Every Sunday we come at you with a roundup of all the jailbreak tweaks that get released in Cydia, and this week will be no different.
* This week we haven’t had any groundbreaking new tweak releases, but there have been some worth talking about. We’ll go over our favorites first and then give you an outline of the other new releases.
* PreferenceTag3 – $1.99

* It’d be hard not to recommend PreferenceTag3, which is easily my favorite jailbreak tweak release of the entire week.
* This tweak lets you clean up all of the clutter of the Settings app so that only the preference cells that mean anything to you appear and show up first in the app. You can organize preference cells in any order that you want to, hide ones that don’t matter, organize them into folders, and even passcode protect preference cells.
* With all of these options available to you, you can finally control how your Settings app looks and have more leverage over making your iOS device more how you want it to be instead of how Apple wants it to be.
* You can read more about the inner workings of this tweak and how to download it in our full review and you can also watch our in-depth video on how to use it.
* AllByeTweaks: Groups all your ‘bye’ tweaks in one preferences pane in the Settings app (free)
* Calverter: Lets you copy and paste hex and octal representation in the Calculator app (free)
* Ensemble: Adds Control Center controls to your Notification Center (free)
