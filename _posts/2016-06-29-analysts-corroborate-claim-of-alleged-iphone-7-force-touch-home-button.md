* Cowen and Company analysts have corroborated an unconfirmed story which two days ago reiterated prior reports that the next iPhone would sport a Home button with haptic feedback to simulate a click, using the same approach as Force Touch on the Apple Watch.
* Citing “field checks” to back up its research and projections, the analysts were quoted by Business Insider as saying that this new Home button will sit flush with the rest of the iPhone 7. They also expect the device will lack a headphone jack and will be waterproof, as previous rumors have suggested.
* The notion of an all-digital Home button that would sit flush with the front face of the phone was illustrated earlier this month by a blurry leaked picture that was published by MobiPicker.
* DigiTimes was first out of the gate with a story back in April 2016 claiming that the iPhone 7 would come outfitted with a touch-sensitive Home button and use various tapping gestures to simulate different button presses, like invoking the app switcher, Reachability and more.
