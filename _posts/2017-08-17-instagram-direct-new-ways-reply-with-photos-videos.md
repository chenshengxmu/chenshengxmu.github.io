* Instagram on Thursday announced new ways to reply with photos and videos in Direct that the company hopes will help users conduct fun conversation with their friends in a more visually appealing manner, including one feature that permits you to send a split-screen reply.
* The mobile app for iOS and Android now lets you reply with a photo or video to specific photos, videos and reshared posts in Direct, which is Instagram’s direct messaging feature for private sharing with friends and family. Just tap Reply to open the Instagram camera to take a photo or video, then use the app’s built-in creative tools to apply effects before sending.

* Your reply will include a sticker of what you’re replying to, and you can draw on the sticker.
* As I mentioned, you can even send a split-screen reply by tapping on the sticker. “Add your own perspective by drawing on the sticker, whether you’re painting a mustache on your friend’s selfie or doodling on a beach photo,” said the company.
* These new capabilities require Instagram version 10.34 for iOS.
* This is a staggered release so not all users will get the new Direct features at the same time. According to the company, these updates will be rolling out globally over the coming weeks.

* And lastly, the Facebook-owned photo-sharing service has rolled out a customizable face filter that brings the style of the 1960s to your photos with virtual hats, glasses and outfits.
* Simply mix and match the accessories to create your own look that’s uniquely you or, if you’re a lazy type, tap the background for some kaleidoscopic-style psychedelic surprise.
* Grab Instagram for free from App Store.
