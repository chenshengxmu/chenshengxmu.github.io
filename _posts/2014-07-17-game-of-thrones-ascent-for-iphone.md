* HBO, the premium cable and satellite television network owned by Time Warner (which itself could get acquired by Rupert Murdoch-owned 21st Century Fox) today has enabled iPhone owners to enjoy the worlds from the successful Game of Thrones book and television series.
* Having originally launched on the iPad in time for Season 4 debut in late-March, developer Disruptor Beam once again teamed up with Kongregate, having bumped the game to version 2.0 and adding native support for the iPhone and iPod touch.
* Jump past the fold for the specifics…
* The companion app lets you immerse yourself beyond the Game of Thrones books and show, living the life of a noble in Westeros and working with or against other players in an authentic game world.
* Taking part in thousands of story-driven quests, players delve deeply into the lore and develop their own lands and reputation among the Great Houses.
* Players explore an expansive world filled with deep political and social play involving diplomatic agreements, pacts, marriages, and betrothals.
* Through Alliance challenges, players work with hundreds of others to accomplish great tasks and rise to the top of the Power Rankings.
* Check out additional iPhone screenshots below.
