* LG’s UltraFine 5K Display, the external ultra high-resolution display Apple didn’t want to make, is now available to order through Apple.com. The display can be ordered with Apple’s in-store pickup option (availability of in-store pickup may vary from one store to another). First orders were scheduled to deliver on December 27 or 28, with in-store pickup availability on December 29. However, estimated delivery times quickly slipped to 2-4 weeks.
* Many locations, like Apple Fashion Valley, won’t receive them before January 20, 2017.
* To check availability of in-store pickup for the display, visit the product listing on Apple.com and click the “Check Availability” link underneath the Pickup heading in the lefthand column. After selecting a desired store from the list, you will get an estimated delivery date for that particular store.
* Following its recent decision to exit the standalone display business, Apple teamed up with LG to offer customers a pair of brand new monitors from LG: 21.5-inch UltraFine 4K Display and $1299.95 27-inch UltraFine 5K Display.
* Both products are available with a 25 percent discount for a limited time.
* UltraFine 4K Display is currently listed with a $524 price tag while its 5K counterpart will set you back $974. Discounted pricing for these displays was set to return to LG’s suggested retail prices on December 31, but it’ll remain in effect until March 31, 2017.
* Apple’s price cuts for USB-C adapters and accessories were also extended from year end to March 31, 2017.
* If you order your 5K UltraFine Display from Apple.com with in-store pickup, you will receive a notification email when your shipment is ready to be picked up. You can pick up the order yourself or have someone else pick it up for you.
* LG’s 5K display has a 5,120-by-2,880-pixel resolution screen with 14.7+ million pixels.
* It measures 27 inches diagonally, just like Apple’s phased-out Thunderbolt Display, supports P3 wide color gamut and uses the Thunderbolt 3 protocol to drive 5K video, stereo speakers, a built-in camera, three USB-C ports on the back at USB 3.1 speeds and up to 85 watts of charging power over a single cable.
* 15-inch MacBook Pro models are capable of driving four 4K external displays or two 5K external displays at 60 Hz, in addition to their built-in screen.
* Yesterday, Apple began offering in-store pickup for AirPods ordered online via Apple.com with February 8 availability.
