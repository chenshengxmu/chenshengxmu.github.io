* Nearly a week following its official launch in the United States, New Zealand and Australia, Nintendo’s incredibly successful Pokémon GO on Tuesday received its first update on the App Store. The freemium app was bumped to version 1.0.1, bringing out much-needed bug fixes whilst resolving an issue which caused the app to crash after attempting to catch any discovered pokémon. More importantly, full Google Account access is no longer needed for those who use this sign-in option.
* Pokémon GO is a free download from the App Store.
* This edition of the game includes the following fixes:
* If you signed in to the game with your Google Account, you’re advised to revoke full access rights using Google’s My Account web app.
* Log in with your Google Account at security.google.com/settings/u/0/security/permissions, then click Pokemon GO Release in the list of connected apps and revoke access to the app.
* Don’t worry, your saved progress will be kept intact.

* Now relaunch the game on your iPhone, choose Google as your preferred login method and provide your Google Account credentials when asked. On Google’s permissions screen, choose Allow and you’re good to go.
* Folks concerned that full Google Account access gave developer Niantic Labs permission to access their Gmail messages, contacts and other account data needn’t worry—Niantic confirmed that only the basic Google profile information has been used to log players into the game as asking for full access was a mistake on their part.
* Pokémon GO is a free download from the App Store with optional In-App Purchases.
