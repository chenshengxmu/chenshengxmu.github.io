* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app Streaks Workout. For the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pick up the popular fitness aide for free for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV—a solid savings of $3.
* From the App Store Editors’ notes:
* Sometimes we get so intimidated by complex exercise plans that we just give up and seek solace in the snack cupboard. Streaks Workout, like its to-do list sibling, eases us in by breaking down workouts into fun, easy-to-tackle chunks. In as little as six minutes—or more if we’re feeling ambitious—we’ve done our daily exercise and charted our progress. Why didn’t anyone tell us it could be this simple?
* And a few more screenshots for good measure:
