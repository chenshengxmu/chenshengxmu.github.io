* Seriously, Microsoft has plans to officially sell a whopping 80-inch tablet, their VP has confirmed. This beast of a ‘tablet’ is powered by Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8 operating system and is currently hung on the wall in CEO Steve Ballmer’s office.
* It’s apparently become Ballmer’s whiteboard, email and phone replacement and the company plans to market it for office use initially. No word on pricing or availability yet.
* I’d sure love to have such a Minority Report-style display adorn my office walls. The closes thing to this outrageous display in the Apple world? That non-TV TV from Apple that Forrester dreamed up yesterday…
* This is not a joke.
* Microsoft vice president Frank Shaw told Wired UK yesterday that Ballmer’s been loving this massive 80-inch multi-touch display driven by Windows 8.
* Steve Ballmer has an 80-inch Windows 8 tablet in his office. He’s got rid of his phone, he’s got rid of his note paper. It’s touch-enabled and it’s hung on his wall.  It’s his whiteboard, his email machine and it’s a device we’re going to sell.
* Just don’t count on Microsoft targeting average consumers with this monstrosity.
* It’s not a consumer thing now, but we know historically that that’s how all things start. The idea that there should be a screen that’s not a computer, we’ll laugh at that in two years.
* The device showcases the ability of Windows 8 to scale from the smallest smartphone and tablet screens to screens of 80 inches and beyond.
* Every screen should be touch, every screen should be a computer and should be able to see out as well as see in. That is the way the world is heading [and] those screens are going to be big, small, wall-sized and desk-sized.
* The company demoed Windows 8 Consumer Preview on this very display in February.
* Now, I’ve always been a big fan of Microsoft’s Surface concept.
* As much as Apple has mainstreamed multi-touch user interfaces on small-screen mobile devices, Redmond has done the same for jumbo-sized display with their Surface technology.
* Having had a chance to play with Surface 2.0 extensively, I walked away very impressed, even if the system lacks the polish and smoothness of iOS.
* You’ve probably seen Microsoft Surface devices installed in banks, certain AT&T retail stores and airports.
* They’re still far from cropping up everywhere, but the technology does have tremendous potential.
* Now, combine Surface and Windows 8 into a single product and price it within average small businesses’ reach and presto – you have a winner.
* These things are bound to take over whiteboards in offices.
* I can certainly see huge wall-mounted displays powered by Windows 8 software used extensively in a lot of places, from banks and conference rooms to trade shows, retail stores and other high-trafficked points of sale.
* Wouldn’t you want to hang this thing up on your wall?
