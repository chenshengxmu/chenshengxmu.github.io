* Mac notebook and desktop computers purchased in Australia or New Zealand now come with warranty coverage for up to three years from the original date of purchase, effectively bypassing the need for an extended AppleCare coverage.
* An internal document distributed to Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, seen by MacRumors, acknowledges that the Cupertino firm has updated its warranty policy to comply with consumer law in Australia and New Zealand. Now the company will offer warranty coverage on most Mac parts for up to 24 months after its limited one-year warranty period.
* “Apple is complying with Australia and New Zealand laws that give consumers the right to ask for a repair or replacement free of charge if a product experiences failure within a ‘reasonable’ amount of time after purchase,” the publication wrote Wednesday.
* The new warranty coverage period is effective from December 13, 2017.
* Eligible parts include:
* Previously, getting warranty coverage for up to three years required purchasing an optional AppleCare extended warranty coverage. AppleCare provides global repair coverage, both parts and labor, from Apple-authorized technicians around the world for your Mac’s battery, RAM, AirPort, accessories and other parts.
* AppleCare prices in the United States range from as low as $99 for a Mac mini to $169 for an iMac, or as high as $249 in the case of an Mac Pro. Most importantly, AppleCare includes coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for any other damage.
