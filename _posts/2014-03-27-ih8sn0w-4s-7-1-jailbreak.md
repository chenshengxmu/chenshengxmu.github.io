* Despite our warnings, a number of folks have updated their devices to iOS 7.1 within the last few weeks, and they’ve quickly learned that the update kills the iOS 7 jailbreak. Many have asked us if we think evasi0n7 will be updated to work with the new firmware, but it doesn’t seem very likely.
* That doesn’t mean it’s impossible though. Last week, winocm posted a video of his fully jailbroken iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1, and yesterday iH8sn0w one-up him. Amidst a flurry of responses to questions regarding the state of the jailbreak, the hacker confirmed his iPhone 4s is jailbroken on 7.1…
* Here’s the referenced tweet:
* @NGeary14 well my 4S is jailbroken on 7.1 atm.

* Unfortunately, reading through iH8sn0w’s feed (and wow, props to him for putting up with what he does), it doesn’t sound like he’s working on a public release. At one point he says “I don’t have any intentions of working on a 7.1/8 jb atm,” and notes that any claims of a public iOS 7.1 jailbreak are false.
* Note: we have seen several jailbreak-related scams pop up for iOS 7.1, like this one. Remember if we haven’t reported on it, it hasn’t happened yet.
* So for now it would appear that although jailbreaking iOS 7.1 is possible, there are no current plans to release a consumer-friendly version. And to be honest, that’s what we were expecting anyway. Typically hackers like to hold onto their exploits for use in major releases—such as the upcoming iOS 8.
* We’ll obviously let you know, though, if this changes.
