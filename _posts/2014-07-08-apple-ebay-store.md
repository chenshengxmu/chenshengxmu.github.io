* Back in November 2012, a secret mini-store popped up on eBay with officially certified, little-used Apple products, similar to those found on the company’s own refurbished section at the Online Apple Store.
* However, since selling through the initial allotment of good-as-new gear the Apple Certified Refurbished Products section on eBay has seen little activity in terms of deals on iPhones, iPad, MacBooks and other products.
* Today, Apple reportedly launched a brand new secret store – again on eBay, but this time around offering certified and unlocked GSM iPhone 5 units, with prices starting at $449 with free shipping…
* These prices compare very favorably to Apple’s $549 price for the baseline iPhone 5c model with sixteen gigabytes of storage.
* The store, dubbed the “Factory Outlet eBay Store” and available here (via AppleInsider), is devoid of Apple branding though the layout appears to be a carbon-copy of Apple’s previous store-within-a-store on eBay.
* The products seem to be factory-refurbished by Apple itself, having received complete burn-in testing. Additionally, the iPhone refurbs on eBay come with a brand new battery and the company’s standard 1-year warranty.
* The phones have been professionally repackaged with a “final quality inspection performed by Apple.”
* Note that Apple has never offered – directly or indirectly – refurbished iPhones.
* For what it’s worth, Apple’s first eBay store – which sold refurbished iPads at $100 less than on Apple’s own online store – was part of a three-month pilot program that the company chose not to renew, as per AppleInsider.
