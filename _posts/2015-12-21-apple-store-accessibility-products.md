* According to the Japanese blog Macotkara, Apple Stores are expected to start stocking accessibility-related accessories and peripherals in the fiscal 2016 second quarter, which works out to the January-March timeframe. The report doesn’t detail which accessories Apple’s retail stores might carry beyond stating that they will be iOS/OS X-compatible.
* Apple has done a lot in years past to make its products appeal to people with disabilities. Its efforts were recognized by The American Foundation for the Blind which gave the company a Helen Keller Achievement Award for its Voice Over feature.
* The president of the National Federation of the Blind thinks that the iPhone maker “has done more for accessibility than any other company.”
* In addition to Voice Over, Apple’s Accessibility technologies in iOS and OS X include features such as Guided Access, high-contrast interfaces, full-screen zooming and more. Back in October 2015, the Cupertino firm was involved with the NDIS New World Conference 2015 which was held in Australia.
* The App Store recently highlighted apps for Global Accessibility Awareness Day and also celebrated the anniversary of Americans with Disabilities Act.
