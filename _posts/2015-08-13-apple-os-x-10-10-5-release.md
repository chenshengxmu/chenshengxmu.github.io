* In addition to iOS 8.4.1, Apple on Thursday also seeded OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, a free update for Macs. The release comes after two developer betas and a month of testing, and you can find it in the Updates tab of the Mac App Store.
* Most notably, the update features a patch for the DYLD privilege escalation bug that was discovered earlier this month. Apple says in the release notes that the software includes fixes for both Mail and Photos apps, as well as QuickTime.
* 10.10.5 is likely one of the last updates for OS X Yosemite, as Apple is expected to release its successor, El Capitan, within the next couple of months. Because it fixes a security issue, we recommend that everyone download it immediately.
* Introduced at Apple’s developer conference in June, OS X El Capitan eschews major new features in favor of performance and stability improvements. There are a few changes, though, such as a revamped Mission Control with Split Screen.
