title: iOS 4.3.1 to Improve Battery Life?

* As we reported last week, iOS 4.3 comes with serious battery drains for some users. While I haven’t updated my iPhone 4 to 4.3 yet (I need my unlock), I can tell that the battery on my iPad 2 4.3 isn’t that great at all.
* The guys over at BGR got their hands on a 4.3.1 build and were didn’t see anything new in there, besides the fact that battery life seems a bit better. They didn’t conduct any kind of scientific test on it so it’s hard to verify if battery is indeed better…
* Apparently iOS 4.3.1 will be released to fix bugs but won’t bring anything new to the table. It’s still expected to ship in 1-2 weeks, as we previously reported.
