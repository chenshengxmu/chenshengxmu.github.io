* Developer Riley Testut, the brains behind a Game Boy emulator for iOS called GBA4iOS, said on Twitter yesterday that he is now focusing his energies on a brand new software designed to emulate the hardware of popular SNES, Game Boy and Nintendo 64 consoles. He’s calling it Delta and it’s launching this December in beta although a teaser website does not reveal if this will be an app that you’ll be able to sideload onto an iOS device without jailbreaking.
* Visiting the deltaemulator.com website currently displays no information aside from blurry images of controllers for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo 64 as well as photos of the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color consoles.
* Twitter user Dario Sepulveda responded to Testut’s tweet by confirming he had seen an early version of the forthcoming emulator, saying “it’s going to be amazing”. Many other Twitter commenters have said the same. “Riley showed me an early build months ago at WWDC and let me tell you, y’all are gonna be amazed,” another commenter wrote.
* Going through the tweets, it would seem that Delta won’t require a jailbreak. Asked if there will be an Apple TV version of Delta, Testut responded by saying that “there are some technical issues right now standing in the way, so we’ll see”.
* More information is coming soon, including how to become a beta tester next month. Stay tuned as we bring you more tidbits pertaining to Delta as they become available.
