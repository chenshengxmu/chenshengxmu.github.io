* Have you ever wondered what your iDevice’s springboard would look like if your icons didn’t have any labels? Think of how much less cluttered your home screen would feel without all of that text.
* There are already packages in Cydia that could help you go label-free, but there’s a new kid on the block. Alphacon allows you to change the transparency level of your icon labels, or make them disappear all together…
* The nice thing about this utility is that it’s free-standing, meaning it doesn’t require Winterboard. It also doesn’t add any extra icons to your homescreen, and can be tweaked from within the stock Settings app.

* Once downloaded, you’ll have to pop into your Settings app to enable Alphacon. From there you can select the alpha (transparency) level of your icon labels, or you can just flat out hide them.
* The customization extends far beyond the homescreen. You can customize transparency levels of app icon labels in your folders, dock, and even your multitasking bar.
* I have to say I’m really diggin’ the clean, no-label look I have going on. I might just keep Alphacons around for awhile. If you’re thinking you might want to go label-free, Alphacon is available for free in Cydia.
* Have you tried it yet?
