* Yesterday, 9to5Mac reported that it had heard from reliable sources that Apple was on the verge of releasing a new Apple TV. The site claimed that there’s a good chance that we could see the product unveiled alongside the new iPad next week.
* The report makes sense, considering the previous proof we’ve seen that an ATV refresh was on the way. But in case you needed any more convincing, AppleInsider has uncovered some new evidence…
* “For three consecutive weeks, the Cupertino-based company has failed to make good on its promissory to restock indirect channel partners with fresh inventory of the existing $99 Apple TV product, say people familiar with matter.
* Instead, partners and channel members have seen Apple push back deliveries each consecutive week by one additional week — a practice that almost always foreshadows a formal discontinuation of a product ahead of new models.”
* The new Apple TV is expected to feature a new processor (possibly the A5 or the A5X) and Bluetooth 4.0 technology. The upgraded components would allow the device to stream 1080p content and play fullscreen HD games.
* The jury is still out on Apple’s full-scale television set. It’s starting to seem more likely that we won’t see it until sometime next year. But don’t dismiss what the company is doing with its set top box. It still has to convince people that Apple belongs in the living room.
