* Apple today posted a nicely done television commercial featuring blind musician Stevie Wonder and soul, R&B, jazz and blues singer Andra Day. The holiday-themed ad cleverly promotes the Mac and VoiceOver and Accessibility features.
* In the video, the two musicians can be seen performing Stevie Wonder’s 1967 holiday classic, “Someday At Christmas”. The 90-second commercial is now available on Apple’s YouTube channel and we’ve embedded it right below for your viewing pleasure.

* I like how the ad closes with a “Love, Apple” message.

* If I had to pick my favorite Apple holiday ad, I would be torn between the beautifully done 2011 iPhone 4s ad featuring Santa Clause and Siri and last year’s Misunderstood commercial, both of which perfectly evoked the Christmas spirit in me.
* Here’s the iPhone 4s one.
