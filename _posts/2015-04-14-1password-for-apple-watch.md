* Developer AgileBits on Tuesday announced an update to its freemium password-management app for the iPhone and iPad, 1Password, which now includes Apple Watch compatibility.
* So, what’s managing passwords, secure notes and other confidential information is like on your wrist? According to developers, “it only takes a couple of taps” to retrieve your stored items such as a combination for your gym locker or garage door, look up your credit card number or even retrieve a one-time password on websites that use two-factor authentication for stronger security.
* As a reminder, 1Password recently rolled out support for two-factor authentication codes in both iOS and Mac edition of the software.
* And in addition to Apple Watch support, 1Password 5.4 features several refinements on the iPhone and iPad, like a button to mark everything as read in the Message Center and a toggle to remove the unread badge from the settings tab.
* Lastly, the app now keeps track of whether you were viewing Favorites or Categories and takes you back there when you reopen the app. 1Password 5.4 will be rolling out across App Stores around the world later today.
* Download 1Password at no cost in the App Store.
