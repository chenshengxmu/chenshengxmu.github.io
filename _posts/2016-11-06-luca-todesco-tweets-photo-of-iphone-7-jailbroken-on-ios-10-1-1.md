* At the end of last week, a demo video surfaced on Reddit revealing what appeared to be an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.1 that was jailbroken.
* There was a lot of skepticism surrounding its legitimacy, but now the established iOS hacker Luca Todesco is sharing photographic evidence of his own iPhone 7 jailbroken on iOS 10.1.1 via Twitter.
* iOS 10.1.1 is currently Apple’s latest public firmware for iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads, and it has closed a ton of security holes that could have been used for jailbreaking.
* Todesco’s personal jailbreak isn’t linked to the one from last week. Each were made by two different individuals who would more than likely be using different exploits to get to the jailbroken state.
* Creating a jailbreak for Apple’s latest iOS firmware requires getting around new security measures to thwart jailbreaking, like KPP (kernel patch protection). Todesco says he’s managed backwards compatibility with iOS 10.1, in addition to iOS 10.1.1:

* For what it’s worth, Saurik already shared his opinion about these jailbreak teases in the Reddit thread of the demo video from last week, particularly pointing out the sketchiness of having to use a custom-built library instead of Cydia Substrate to run tweaks.
* According to Saurik, a custom library should be unnecessary and Cydia Substrate should run fine on iOS 10, so something is certainly fishy and these demos should be taken with a grain of salt whenever you see them.
* On the other hand, Todesco has a long track record of releasing teaser videos and pictures on Twitter and he’s pretty well-known in the community.
* The rapid releases of new iOS firmware from Apple is putting a lot of pressure on jailbreak teams who are undoubtedly researching the feasibility of a public jailbreak. The cat and mouse game between Apple and hackers is swaying heavily in Apple’s favor.
* Releasing a jailbreak to the public requires a lot of resources, including tons of beta testing across the broad range of iOS 10 devices, programming a stable tool for both macOS and Windows, and then keeping up with bug fixes and improvements even beyond the initial public release.
* These tasks are a lot for a single person to take on, which has played a huge role in why these teases have never been released to the public. Teams like Pangu and TaiG have the greatest likelihood of releasing a jailbreak for iOS 10; according to Pangu, the team has already been working on trying to get something together.
