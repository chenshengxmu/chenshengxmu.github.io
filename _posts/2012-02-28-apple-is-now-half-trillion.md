* Apple’s marketcap has just hit $500 billion dollars, with the help of the flurry of iPad 3 news today. Along with such an accomplishment, Apple has also just set a new 52-week high of $536.39 in after-hours trading.
* Today’s stock surge is due in part to Apple sending out invites to the media for its iPad 3 event, taking place on March 7th in California. This morning there were also rumors of what the iPad 3 might be packing…
* Also due in part to high price of Apple stock, is the explosive holiday quarter the company just came off of. Apple sold a record 37 million iPhones and 15.7 million iPads.
* With a $500 billion marketcap, this gives Apple an almost $90 billion lead as the world’s most valuable company over oil-giant Exxon. Also in comparison, Google has a $200 billion marketcap.
* Apple closed the day at 535.41 points, but quickly rose to 536 points in after hours trading. This gave Apple it’s remarkable half-trillion dollar accomplishment.
* When the stock exchange opens tomorrow morning, we should continue to see Apple’s stock price rise. With excitement building over the iPad 3 due out early March, investors are ready to put their money in Apple.
