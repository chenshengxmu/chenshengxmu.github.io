* Black Friday, a one-day shopping stampede, is the day after Thanksgiving which is celebrated each year on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States (on the second Monday of October in Canada). As Black Friday officially marks the start of the Christmas shopping season, retailers fall over each other in offering not-to-be-missed discounts. Apple just announced on its Australian online store the one-day Apple shopping event on Friday, 23 November…
* First discovered by MacRumors, the page reads:
* Get ready to give. Shop online or visit your favourite Apple Retail Store. We’ll help you make the most of the day, no matter how you shop.
* We’re expecting the teaser to appear on the online US Apple Store shortly.
* The one-day shopping event in Australia is valid on 23 November, 2012, from 2:01am to 24 November, 2012, 1:59am local time.
* Promotional pricing cannot be combined with any other offers and sale prices are limited to stock on hand and while supplies last. The discounts are meant for end-users only and are not available to Apple’s distributors, dealers or resellers.
* I won’t be keeping my fingers crossed for eyebrow-raising discounts because Apple’s Black Friday deals are usually nothing to write home about.
* Last year, for example, Apple shaved between $41 and $61 off of its iPads, depending on the model. The iPod touch was also discounted according to capacity, with savings between $21 and $41.
* Last week, Apple also launched its 2012 Holiday Gift Guide, basically a special page on its web site highlighting a range of first and third-party gadgets and accessories that Apple hopes might make for a nice holiday gift.
* What’s your favorite Black Friday retailer for Apple gear?
