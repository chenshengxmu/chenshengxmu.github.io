* Notice the interesting aspect ratio of this photo? This was done on the fly using PhotoRes, a free new jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* PhotoRes allows users to select from over a dozen pre-defined aspect ratios along with adjusting the resolution of photos taken with the stock Camera app. Once the settings are established, you can begin taking photos using the changes immediately, as no pesky resprings are required.
* As mentioned, you’ll find lots of canned aspect ratios included in PhotoRes’ preferences. You’ll find common ratios like the iPad-centric 4:3 ratio, along with more obscure ratios (for iPhone photos at least) like 2.39:1, which is usually used for film releases.

* Along with the aspect ratio adjustments, users can also establish a custom resolution using the tweak’s preferences. But don’t get any funny ideas when it comes to resolution, as the tweak maxes out at the stock max resolution of the device. You’ll also have to deal with some visual distortion when tweaking the resolution to any serious degree, as demonstrated in the photo below.

* You can insert lower resolutions for some funny looking pictures.
* I really like PhotoRes. It’s a super-simple tweak with well laid out preferences. It makes customizing both the aspect ratio and resolution of photos a breeze, and it integrates perfectly with the stock Camera app.
