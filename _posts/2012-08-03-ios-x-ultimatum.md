* If you’re searching for one of the best looking themes for the iPhone, then search no further than iOS X Ultimatum. The sequel of sorts to the original OS X Lion Ultimatum, this theme seeks to merge the desktop and the small screen into one environment.
* Does this theme perform just as well as it looks? Check inside for the full scoop…
* Themes, whether it be WinterBoard or DreamBoard, aren’t normally praised for their efficiency or familiarity from a usage standpoint. People use themes because they look unique.
* iOS X Ultimatum is no different in this regard; it looks great, but the performance is hit and miss.
* The main issue I encountered while using this theme was failing to get my taps to register on screen. I found myself having to tap multiple times on the same item for it to actually pick up my input.
* Seeing as that one of the iPhone’s hallmarks is its responsiveness, this isn’t a good thing. All other gripes besides that are just limitations to the DreamBoard theming platform itself, and not necessarily a fault with the theme.
* Visually, though, iOS X Ultimatum is hard to beat. The graphics are sharp, and the dock and menu bar are easy to make out. It genuinely looks like OS X Mountain Lion was ported to the iPhone.
* If you’re a fan of themes and DreamBoard in particular, then you won’t want to miss this theme. It’s not as good as the original, but it’s a fine addition to the DreamBoard library.
* On the flip side, as I always say; if you don’t like themes, then this one won’t be the one to sway your opinion.
* DreamBoard is a free download on Cydia, but the theme itself is $2.00. Unlike most purchases, this theme is available via the ModMyi forums.
* What do you think? Would you consider using iOS X Ultimatum?
