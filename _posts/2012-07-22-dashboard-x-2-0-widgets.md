* The original Dashboard X was a fairly monumental tweak for jailbroken iOS devices, because it brought true widgets to the iPhone and iPad’s Home screen.
* Dashboard X 2.0, the follow up to the hit release, is aiming to build on all of the things the original Dashboard X did well, while fixing the things it didn’t do so well.
* This time around you can resize widgets using pinch gestures, and you can position widgets on both portrait and landscape orientations independently of one another.
* Simply put, this is an awesome follow up to an already great jailbreak tweak. Check inside for the full video walkthrough…
* One thing you should know is that Dashboard X 2.0 was completely re-written from the ground up, so it’s not just a pile on of new features on top of non-optimized code.
* Along with the two previously mentioned big features, there’s also a brand new pop up menu that replaces that somewhat archaic sheet menu present in the original version. I find that this new pop up menu takes a lot of the pain out of adding new widgets, it’s not nearly as cumbersome as before.
* I also like the fact that there is a new “replace background” option that will ditch the background of the widget in favor of one that’s deemed more appealing for the Home screen.
* Last but not least, I really appreciate the new animations, which make the overall experience seem more complete and Apple like.
* As you’ll no doubt come to realize after using it, this, and many other more changes grace the upcoming release of Dashboard X 2.0. Here’s the full change log for your enjoyment:
* Indeed, as you can see, Dashboard X is a absolute marvelous update, and speaks volumes for how hard the developer (@cjori) has been working away to prepare a great release. Honestly, Ori is quickly becoming one of my favorite developers. If you ask me, his tweaks firmly put him in an elite class of Cydia developers.

* Dashboard X 2.0 isn’t out yet, but once it is released it will be a free upgrade for existing users. For those who haven’t purchased it yet, don’t worry, the price remains the same as the initial version — $1.99 on Cydia’s ModMyi repo.
* What do you think about the latest Dashboard X update? If you haven’t purchased it before, would you be willing to consider it now?
