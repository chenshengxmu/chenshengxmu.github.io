* Rockstar Games has refreshed Grand Theft Auto 3: The 10 Year Anniversary Edition for the iPhone and iPad today, adding several notable features that enhance the experience. Like Electronic Arts’ Real Racing 3, the Grand Theft Auto game now supports cloud saves for hassle-free gameplay across devices.
* Now you can start playing on your iPhone and continue right where you left off on the iPad, and vice versa.
* This is tremendously useful in today’s multi-device world and it’s a shame other game makers don’t support cloud saves out of the box. Grand Theft Auto 3 also now plays nice on the iPhone 5’s taller screen and you can use your own iTunes playlist…
* To listen to your own music in Grand Theft Auto 3, simply create a playlist in iTunes titled GTA3 and the game will use it automatically.
* The mobile game features fully scalable and customizable user interface and includes upgraded textures, greater resolution and draw distance, new mission replay and more.
* Here’s your changelog.
* • iPhone 5 widescreen support • iCloud save game support for seamless progression across all your iOS devices. • custom playlist support • various stability and bug fixes
* This update is free for existing users.
* Otherwise, Grand Theft Auto 3: The 10 Year Anniversary Edition is a $5 download from Apple’s $App Store and Google’s Play store for Android.
* Rockstar Games is scheduled to release Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 17 across platforms and is now accepting pre-orders.
