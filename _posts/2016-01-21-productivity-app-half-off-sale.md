* Folks in the market for a good productivity app will want to head over to the App Store as soon as possible. Apple kicked off a new “Get Productive” promotion on Thursday that takes 50% off some of the most popular titles in the category.
* Among the apps included in the sale are Duet Display, which allows you to use an iPhone or iPad as an extra display, the highly respected PCalc calculator, Readdle’s PDF Expert 5, and the celebrated task, reminder and to-do list app Clear.
* You can check out the sale in its entirety here.
* In an unrelated sale, 1Password for Mac has been discounted down to $24.99 ( $49.99).
* We don’t know how long these prices are good for, but given that Apple typically changes promotions every week, we’re guessing they should at least be around through next Thursday. These are great deals though, so don’t wait too long to act!
