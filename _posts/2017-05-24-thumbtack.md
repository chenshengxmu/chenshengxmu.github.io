* Your iPhone comes equipped with a Notes app right out of the box so you can write things down without forgetting them. On the other hand, people tend to jot down a large number of things, and this makes it hard to differentiate between regular and important notes.
* One of the features the stock Notes app lacks is the ability to pin the most important notes so you can tell them apart, and that’s precisely that a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Thumbtack by iOS developer Evil Penguin aims to fix.
* Once installed, you can tap and hold on any note via the list view in the Notes app to pin it. Pinning a note has the same effect has marking a thread as sticky on a message board; in other words, it stays at the top of the list at all times.
* It’s worth noting that you can pin as many notes as you want. Pinned notes not only stay at the top of the list, but they also display a red thumbtack icon to the left of the note description in the list view of the Notes app, as shown above.
* You can easily un-pin a note by tapping and holding on it for a second time. This process removes the red pin icon from the note and allows it to be buried by new notes once more, just as it would be had it not have been pinned in the first place.
* Thumbtack doesn’t have any options to configure, as the functionality of the tweak is pretty straightforward out of the box. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices and is only compatible with the stock Notes app (it will not work with third-party note apps from the App Store).
* If you’re interested giving Thumbtack a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
