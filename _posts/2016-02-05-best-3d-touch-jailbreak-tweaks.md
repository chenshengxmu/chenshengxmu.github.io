* 3D Touch is the flagship new feature of Apple’s iPhone 6s handset. It’s a part of the display that is capable of capturing forceful touches and performing actions based on how firmly you’re pressing, and Apple has done a great job creating a range of features throughout iOS that take advantage of this display technology.
* But for those that feel iOS leaves a lot to be desired, the jailbreak community has come up with a variety of new uses for 3D Touch, whether your iPhone supports 3D Touch or not. And in this roundup, we’re going to show you a number of tweaks that we think really help compliment the 3D Touch experience on a jailbroken iPhone.
* These won’t be in any specific order, but these are my personal favorite jailbreak tweaks that utilize the iPhone 6s’ 3D Touch display in creative new ways.
* Tether – $0.99

* When I first saw Tether, it was something of creative genius that I wanted to try immediately. It uses the 3D Touch display to let you configure an alarm, reminder, or calendar event based on the time you choose. You can 3D Touch anywhere on the Home screen, and then drag around to select a time.
* The tweak is unique and original, with a very distinct and simplistic interface that draws the eyes and your mind’s curiosity. Although the function of the tweak is relatively simple, we’ve found the user interface of the tweak is intuitive and fun to use.
* Our full review of Tether, which is $0.99 in Cydia’s BigBoss repository, goes over how the tweak works and how to use it.
* Snakebite – $0.99

* Multitasking tweaks always interested me since the day I started jailbreaking, and when Snakebite came out, my response was no different, but what’s unique about Snakebite is how it utilizes the 3D Touch display on your iPhone 6s to let you quickly get to all your favorite and recently-used apps on the left side of the screen.
* Of course, Snakebite doesn’t require 3D Touch; if you don’t have a 3D Touch display, you can use a different gesture instead, but the point is this is a really nice tweak that takes advantage of the 3D Touch display, and I’d recommend giving it a try if you haven’t already.
* In our full review of Snakebite, which is $0.99 in Cydia’s BigBoss repository, we take you through how to use it and what it can do, so check that out too.
* 3D Touch Notifications – $1.49

* When I stumbled upon 3D Touch Notifications, I was amazed to realize that Apple didn’t have this feature implemented in iOS 9 already, but after installing it, I was sure that this was something Apple needed to, or would, add in a future iOS 9 update.
* The tweak lets you peek and pop your incoming notifications from the Lock screen or Notification Center. You can press firmly on your screen and then drag up slightly to reveal a whole conversation history for Messages, Mail, and other supported apps. You can then perform actions, such as replying, marking as read, and more.
* The tweak also works on non-3D Touch iOS devices, but you have to use a tweak called revealMenu to do this. For more information on how 3D Touch Notifications works, which is free in Cydia’s BigBoss repository, but requires the purchase of a $1.49 license, head over to our full review.
* Forcy – Free

* Forcy is a must-have jailbreak tweak for anyone who has a non-3D Touch iPhone, but still wants to take advantage of 3D Touch Quick Actions from the Home screen.
* This tweak makes it so you can tap and hold on app icons to reveal the Quick Action menus that you would normally only see if you had a 3D Touch display and could press firmly on individual app icons on your Home screen.
* Forcy is compatible with a wide variety of aftermarket 3D Touch jailbreak tweaks we’ll be discussing in this post, and if you don’t have a 3D Touch display, it’s a great way to still take advantage of those features.
* For more information about Forcy, which is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository, you can head over to our full review where we demonstrate the tweak and show you how it works.
* In addition to my favorites above, there are also some other good jailbreak tweaks in Cydia that utilize the new 3D Touch gesture built into new iPhones. Here are some additional tweaks, apart from my personal favorites, that you might be interested in taking a peek at:
* 3D Touch to Clear Notifications – Free

* Appendix – Free

* Appendix allows you to use 3D Touch on folder icons from your Home screen to reveal a Quick Action menu full of the first four apps within the folder.
* CalculatorCopy – Free
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/calculatorcopy-review.png)
* CalculatorCopy brings the ability to press firmly on your Calculator app icon to reveal a Quick Action for copying your last result to jailbroken devices. This is a feature that launches with iOS 9.3, and is currently in the beta releases.
* CamTouch – Free

* CamTouch is a tweak that uses the UnlimShortcuts tweak to provide you with additional camera options in the 3D Touch Quick Action menu when you press firmly on the Camera app icon via your Home screen. Those options include taking a panorama and recording video in time-lapse mode.
* Grams – $0.99

* Grams is a tweak that lets you utilize your 3D Touch display to measure the weight of light objects weighing up to 385 grams. The tweak requires the use of a capacitative object, such as a spoon, but can give accurate weight amounts for certain items.
* Point-And-Shoot – Free
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/point-and-shoot.jpeg)
* Point-And-Shoot is a tweak that uses the 3D Touch Quick Actions menu of the Camera app icon from the Home screen to act as a viewfinder and make it easy to snap photos or record videos without having to actually launch the app.
* revealMenu – Free
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RevealMenu-2.png)
* RevealMenu, just like Forcy, is a jailbreak tweak capable of bringing 3D Touch-like functionality to older iOS devices that don’t have a 3D Touch display. This means enabling Quick Actions and Peek-and-Pop functionality throughout iOS with the use of touch screen gestures instead of firm presses.
* Tactful – Free
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tactful.jpeg)
* Tactful allows you to use 3D Touch on the Cydia app icon to reveal Quick Action options, such as refreshing all your sources, adding a new source, viewing your recent Cydia installations, and even searching the Cydia Store for new packages.
* There are a lot of 3D Touch jailbreak tweaks in Cydia that are worth checking out – some are paid and some are free, but seeing how third parties can take advantage of features Apple would otherwise have locked down on a non-jailbroken device is not only inspiring, but hopeful, in that hopefully one day Apple will add some of these features to iOS themselves for everyone to use.
