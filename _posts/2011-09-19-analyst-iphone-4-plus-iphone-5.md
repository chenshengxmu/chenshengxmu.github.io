* Analysts predictions are a dime a dozen, especially these days, when we’re getting soo close to the new iPhone launch. Still, as a news site, it is our duty to report on all of them so you can make your own opinion.
* Reiterating some of the rumors we’ve been hearing for awhile now, JP Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz claims that Apple is just about to launch two new devices this fall: the iPhone 4+ and the iPhone 5.
* We’re not learning anything new here. According to the analyst, the iPhone 5 will be a world phone sporting a dual GSM+CDMA chip, it will have a larger display and an 8MP camera…
* According to Moskowitz, Apple is expected to launch an updated iPhone 4-like model dubbed as iPhone 4+:
* The iPhone 4-plus device is anticipated to be based on the current iPhone and subsume the iPhone 3GS as the lower-end offering.  Mr. Moskowitz thinks it could target one or more network carriers in China, but is unlikely to be exclusive to the region.
* So really, nothing we hadn’t heard about before. If you ask me, I believe this dude has absolutely no clue what’s going on and just wants a little attention.
* Thoughts?
