* Rdio users, rejoice!
* The popular song-matching service, SoundHound, has updated its iOS application with the ability to connect with Rdio and add matched songs to an Rdio playlist.
* You can then listen to them instantly in the Rdio app. The free SoundHound mobile client is available in the App Store. But SoundHound seems to be playing a catch-up game to rivals such as Shazam.
* As a reminder, Shazam implemented Rdio integration last December. But unlike SoundHound’s, Shazam’s implementation not only lets you play recognized tracks through Rdio, but also play back full songs without switching apps…

* Last December, SoundHound picked up support for iTunes Radio letting you listen to tagged tracks on Apple’s free Internet radio service.
* SoundHound 6.2 changelog:
* SoundHound is available free in the App Store.
* The 17.0MB download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.1 or later.
* The $6.99 paid version removes ads while adding a number of advanced features, including the ability to listen to songs you’ve identified instantly with Rdio and Spotify, or add to a playlist. Spotify playlist creation was added to SoundHound apps last February.
* Other capabilities of the pro version: faster music identification, singing and humming recognition, a LiveLyrics feature, news headlines, a built-in music player, real-time Facebook and Twitter updates from artists, geotagging, iTunes links, YouTube videos, Pandora station launching and much more
