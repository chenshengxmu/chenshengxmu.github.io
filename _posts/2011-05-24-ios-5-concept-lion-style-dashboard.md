* Graphic artist Jan-Michael Cart is on a roll these days with his iOS 5 concept videos. After imagining how speech recognition and fast app switching might work on iOS 5 Jan-Michael is now sharing with us his vision of a Lion-style dashboard on Apple’s next iOS update.
* As Cart explains, when you slide over to the old Spotlight Search screen, the wallpaper shifts and you’re taken into a Dashboard screen similar to the kind found in Mac OS X. You can have many pages of widgets…
* I have to say that this concept looks really sexy. I hope someone is watching and taking note over at Cupertino.
* What do you think?
