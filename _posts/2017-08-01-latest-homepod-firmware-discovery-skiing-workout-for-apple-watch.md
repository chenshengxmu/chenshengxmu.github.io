* The unreleased HomePod firmware that Apple “accidentally” published on its servers this past weekend has become a real treasure trove of information about not only iPhone 8 and the speaker itself, but also new fitness features that are possibly coming to Apple Watch.
* As noted by MacRumors, a new skiing workout has been unearthed from the HomePod files.
* Diving deep into the HomePod firmware code, developer Jeffrey Grossman yesterday publicized his findings on Twitter. Apparently, the HomePod’s IPSW firmware files contain strings and references to stuff like “Skiing Workout”, “Downhill Snow Sports Distance”, “Ski Data” and “Workout Activity Type”, among others.

* It’s too early to draw conclusions, but the mention of skiing workout sessions is an indication that Apple is continuing to expand the fitness features of the Apple Watch software.
* The previous watchOS 3 update brought out new swimming exercises while watchOS 4 will include support for calisthenics sessions, also known as High Intensity Interval Training.
* If the skiing workout is coming to Apple Watch, we fully expect Apple to introduce this feature via a point update to watchOS 4 later this fall, ahead of the winter.
