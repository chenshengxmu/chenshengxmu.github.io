* Apple’s Magic Mouse 2 comes standard with your iMac Pro purchase, but you can instead choose a Magic Trackpad 2 if you’d like.
* Designed in Space Gray exclusively for the new iMac Pro, which launched today, both Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 ship in the box. Magic Trackpad 2, however, is optional.
* Replacing your Magic Mouse 2 with a Magic Trackpad 2 will add $50 on top of the price of your iMac Pro. If you’d like both Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2, that’ll be an extra $149.

* Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 are all wireless and use a rechargeable lithium-ion cell so you won’t have to replace any batteries.
* The mouse supports multi‑touch gestures on its surface, allowing you to swipe between webpages, scroll through documents and more. The trackpad gives you the full range of multi-touch gestures and brings Apple’s force-sensing Force Touch technology to the desktop.
* Sensors underneath the trackpad surface detect subtle differences in the amount of pressure you apply, bringing useful shortcuts and enabling a deeper connection to your content.
* Space Gray accessories are available only at the time of your iMac Pro purchase and cannot be purchased separately. By the way, iMac Pro ships with a full-size Magic Keyboard, not the narrower one that lacks the numeric keypad, plus a black-clad USB-A to Lightning cable (also unavailable standalone) for charging your Magic accessories.
