* You know it’s getting close to Christmas time when outlets start publishing gift guides, and Apple updates its ’12 Days of Gifts’ application. The 2013 version of Apple’s free-download-a-day app went live this evening, ahead of its December 26 kickoff.
* Folks in European countries have become accustom to this yearly ritual, but it’s never been available to those of us here in the US. I’m happy to announce, though, that this year, Apple has finally opened up the program to iOS users in the United States…
* From the App Store description:
* “From 26 December – 6 January, you can download a gift each day—songs, apps, books, movies, and more—with the 12 Days of Gifts app. Each day’s gift will only be available for 24 hours, so download the free app to make sure you don’t miss out. Please note: Not all content is available in all countries.”
* You can find the ’12 Days of Gifts’ app, for both the iPhone and iPad, in the App Store for free (if it’s available in your country). Keep in mind that it won’t do much until the 12-day event kicks off later this month, and runs through January of next year.
