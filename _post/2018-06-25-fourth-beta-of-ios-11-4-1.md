* Apple on Monday released a round of new betas to developers. The fourth betas of iOS 11.4.1, tvOS 11.4.1 and macOS 10.13.6, as well as the third beta of watchOS 4.3.2, are now available to registered developers. The updates can be installed through Apple’s dev center, or via each platform’s respective OTA mechanism.
* With iOS 12, and Apple’s other major platform updates, already in beta 2, it’s easy to overlook today’s releases. After all, they are extremely minor by comparison—while the former brings about new features and dramatic performance improvements, the latter contains more bug fixes and under-the-hood changes.
* Nevertheless, we are installing the new software and will be sure to report back with any notable changes or findings.
