* Great news today for Hulu Plus users. The popular streaming service has announced this morning that it has created a brand new app for the Apple TV that will make it easier to find new content and play it back on your favorite set-top box.
* Hulu says it has “redesigned the Plus experience from the ground up” with a new content section, a new “Shows You Watch” tray for quickly accessing your favorite shows, and a more streamlined playback feature, with new Play button…
* From Hulu’s blog post:
* “At Hulu’s development center in Seattle, we spend our time focusing on making the Hulu Plus living room experience delightful for our subscribers. We’ve redesigned the Hulu Plus experience from the ground up – making it even easier to find your favorite current season TV episodes and discover a new favorite show.”
* Perhaps the most noticeable change are the new content categories listed across the top navigation bar, such as TV, Kids, Latino, Search, etc. Here you’ll be able to see the newest additions to Hulu’s library, making it easy to discover new programming.
* If you’d rather just jump into your favorite shows right away, you can access the new “Shows You Watch” tray. Hulu says it built this new feature to make sure that you never miss a new episode or lose your place in your favorite television series.
* You’ll have to be on the latest iOS firmware to get the new Hulu app (find this by going to Settings > General > Update Software), and you’ll need to have an account registered at huluplus.com/appletv in order to start streaming video content.
* Edit: Warning! The latest version of Apple TV firmware will kill your jailbreak. Click here for more information.
* Hulu launched its Plus app on the Apple TV in July of last year. The service is $7.99 per month, and comes with a one week free trial.
* Have you tried the new Hulu app yet? What do you think?
