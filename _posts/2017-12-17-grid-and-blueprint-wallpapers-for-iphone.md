* For a long time, blueprint wallpapers were popular on earlier iPhone devices. However, the precision required to make a blueprint style wallpaper prevented an iPhone X version from surfacing for some time. Earlier I was asked on Twitter if I found any and the search began. I am happy to report, there is a complete stash of blueprint, grid, and outline styled wallpapers for you to download. 
* Before diving into the downloads, note that these wallpapers will not work if you move them around when setting them as your wallpaper. Also, if you have parallax effect on, you will be able to see the icons slide out of their gridded box, as you move your iPhone around. The ones for iPhone X do perfectly fit, as I’ve checked the blueprint myself. (I know the mockup at the top of the article isn’t exact, but when you set the image on your background, it will line up)
* I found the iPhone X versions on “Mysterious iPhone Wallpaper,” which you should visit for a whole lot more. The site contains many more colors and additional designs that I did not chose to curate in this article. There are links to additional galleries below the corresponding images.
* Additionally, there is one blueprint wallpaper at the bottom for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. I did not test these, as I only own an iPhone X. These additional images were found on iOSHacker, which also includes additional colors and designs.
* Finally, if you have any great wallpapers or come across an amazing gallery find me via @jim_gresham. Also, follow along for mid-week downloads, tips and tricks!
