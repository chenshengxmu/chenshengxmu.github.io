* For as long as I’ve owned an iPhone, I’ve always sort of wondered why Apple never bothered to integrate any type of visualizer into the iOS interface.
* But now, anyone that may have wanted a visualizer in iOS can use a new free jailbreak tweak called MitsuhaXI by iOS developer Ominousness to get one.
* One thing that stood out to us about MitsuhaXI right off the bat is how it works in a universal fashion. Not only does it decorate the stock Music app with media playback animations, but it also does the same with the Lock screen’s Now Playing interface.
* But if that wasn’t enough, the developer went a step further and added support for several third-party Music app alternatives, such as Deezer, Spotify, and SoundCloud.
* As you might’ve expected, MitsuhaXI adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure a few options:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a convenient respring button in the preference pane that you’ll need to use when you want to save any changes to the settings.
* At first glance, MitsuhaXI looks like an awesome way to bring waveform-like animations to the iOS music-listening experience. Anyone that might enjoy these visualizations is advised to check it out, especially since it’s a free download from Cydia’s Packix repository.
* Notably, MitsuhaXI works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices, and the developer open-sourced the tweak on GitHub for anyone that might be interested in learning about how it works.
* Do you like audio visualizers when listening to music? Let us know in the comments section below.
