* Whenever you search for stuff using Spotlight on your iPhone, a history of what you’ve searched for is kept just below the Siri app suggestions.
* If you’re concerned about the privacy of your web search history via Spotlight, then you might want to download a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Spotlight No Suggest by iOS developer ichitaso.
* As shown above, this tweak serves the simple purpose of behaving like a private browsing mode for Spotlight web searches.
* After installation, your web search history will be hidden from the Spotlight search interface and all new web searches will continue to be hidden until the tweak is uninstalled from your device.
* If you use the Private Browsing feature in Safari and you find it to be a bit of a nuisance that the Spotlight search bar doesn’t behave in the same way, then this is certainly the jailbreak tweak for you.
* Spotlight No Suggest doesn’t have any options to configure and is available as a free download right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices only.
* Do you like the idea of being able to conceal your Spotlight web search history? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.
