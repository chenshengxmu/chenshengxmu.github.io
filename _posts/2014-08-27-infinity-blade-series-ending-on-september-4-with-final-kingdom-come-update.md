* The iOS-exclusive Infinity Blade series will conclude on September 4, the video game production company ChAIR Entertainment, the brains behind the game, confirmed in a blog post.
* The elegiac masterpiece and one of my favorite games on the iOS platform is set to come to its inevitable conclusion in the final content update, dubbed ‘Kingdom Come.’
* Free to all Infinity Blade III players, ‘Kingdom Come’ will reveal some new secrets, answer more questions and “set you on a quest to defeat one very pissed off dragon,” as ChAIR put it.
* According to the post, the epic conclusion to the Infinity Blade saga delivers a stunning new environment, in addition to dozens of new items and weapons, and new enemies to defeat, including the new dragon mentioned above.
* As the series reaches its end, the folks at ChAIR have put together a nice little Infinity Blade tribute trailer that takes a look back at the trilogy.
* If you’re a fan of the series, watch the video closely as ChAIR says it contains glimpses of upcoming new content sprinkled throughout.
* Also, ChAIR will be sharing more details soon as they’ll be “looking for ways to expand the Infinity Blade universe further”.
* An iOS exclusive and the closest thing to a so-called system seller, the Infinity Blade series taps Epic Games’ powerful Unreal Engine to deliver console-quality graphics on the iOS platform.
* Apple would typically invite Epic to share details of upcoming Infinity Blade games at its media events. For example, Infinity Blade 3 was unveiled at the double-iPhone launch in September of last year.

* Given that the rumored September 9 iPhone 6 launch is now less than two weeks away, and with the Infinity Blade trilogy concluding five days earlier, my gut feeling is telling me that a brand new ChAIR game will be demoed during the iPhone 6 unveiling.
* It will be powered by the latest Unreal Engine 4 and show off the processing and graphics power of the handset, methinks.

* Folks attending PAX Prime will have a chance to play the new ‘Kingdom Come’ content early as ChAIR will be demoing the update at the Epic Games booth #7505 on the sixth floor from Friday, August 29 through Monday, September 1.
* “The first 100 players each day will get an exclusive PAX Prime t-shirt,” the team teased. “We’ll also have temporary tattoos and some other surprises.”

* Infinity Blade III is $6.99 in the App Store.
* The massive 1.82-gigabyte download runs on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad supported by iOS 6.0 or later. It’s a resource-intensive game so best thing you play it on A7 devices like the iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display.
