* Like it or not, video on Instagram video is here to stay. And with five million videos uploaded to Instagram in the first 24 hours and given the Instagram brand strength, small wonder that Vine shares on Twitter have plummeted since Instagram video debut.
* Not resting on its laurels, just this past weekend Instagram received a small update adding support for the Cinema video stabilization feature for your iPhone’s front camera, previously available on the rear camera only. Not only that, you can now shot video holding the Instagram camera in landscape orientation…
* Release notes confirm that landscape support includes both Instagram photo and video.
* In addition to this and support for Cinema stabilization via a front-facing camera, the new Instagram version 4.0.2 includes “many other improvements and bug fixes”.
* The Cinema feature automatically stabilizes a shaky video, after you take it. You can disable stabilization by tapping the shaky camera icon on the filters screen.

* And if you’re on a metered data plan, you’ll want to set Auto-Play Videos to Off in Instagram > Settings.
* You can grab the free app from the App Store.
* A few popular iOS apps have already been updated with Instagram video support, including Twitter client Tweetbot and social news reader Flipboard.
