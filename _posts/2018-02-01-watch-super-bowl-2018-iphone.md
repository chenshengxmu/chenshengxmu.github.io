* On Sunday evening, tens of millions of people will gather around their TV sets to watch Super Bowl 52. The New England Patriots are taking on the Philadelphia Eagles for the coveted Vince Lombardi trophy, and Kickoff is set for 6:30PM ET (3:30PM PT).
* For years, the rights to the Big Game have rotated between the three major networks (NBC, FOX and CBS), and this year it’s NBC’s turn. So if you do happen to be in front of a TV on Sunday, use your cable/satellite box or OTA antenna to tune into your local NBC affiliate to catch all the Super Bowl coverage
* For those of you who aren’t going to be in front of a TV set, never fear—iDB has you covered! We’ve rounded up the best ways for you to follow the action on your iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and other devices.

* Live streaming the Super Bowl to your iPhone will be, for the first time in recent memory, available to everyone. Verizon’s long-term exclusivity deal on mobile streaming rights ended in January, meaning anyone can watch the game on the go using either Yahoo Sports or the NFL Mobile app—regardless of carrier.

* Watching the game on your iPad will also be super easy. NBC has decided that it’s going to stream the Super Bowl to its NBC and NBC Sports apps for free, no credentials required. So even if you don’t pay for a premium cable or satellite service, you’ll be able to catch the game.

* The same holds true for Apple TV (and other set-top boxes) where the NBC and NBC Sports apps are available. Obviously if you’re in front of a TV, you might as well watch the NBC TV channel. But if you don’t have access to it this is the next best thing.

* Want to watch the Super Bowl on your computer? You guessed it, simply just open your browser and navigate to NBC.com or NBCSports.com and you’ll be able to catch the live stream.

* Twitter
* Twitter has over the years evolved into the place to follow live sporting events. There are great hash tags and people to follow, or you can let the social network do the work for you with its Moments feature. Here you’ll find a variety of content including video highlights, up-to-the-minute scores and stats, breaking news, and commentary from past and current professionals in the industry—all in a single, digestible stream. Even if I’m watching a game live, I often check Twitter after a big or controversial play to read other people’s realtime reactions.
* ESPN
* Honestly, you could probably replace ESPN with any top sports news app, but I prefer this one for its design and feature set. The content available here is nowhere near what you can find on Twitter, but it checks all of the boxes including stats, scores, news, highlights and even play-by-play coverage.
* YouTube
* For those who don’t really care about the game, but want to watch the commercials everyone is going to be talking about, check out YouTube’s AdBlitz page.
* And that should just about cover it! Again, the Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 ET at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. If you think we missed a notable streaming method, particularly for overseas viewers, be sure to let us know about it down in the comments!
