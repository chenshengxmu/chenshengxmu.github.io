* In addition to adding support for Accelerated Mobile Pages to Chrome for iOS, Google also this morning issued a refresh to its native search app on the App Store, which supports Google Now cards. Google 17.0 for iOS, a free download, packs in improvements to help you get things done more quickly in the app such as the addition of a Forward button (what took them so long, really?), a more reliable voice search, the ability to revisit recent pages for a full seven days and a few local search results improvements.
* “Based on your feedback, recent pages and searches are now accessible longer,” says Google. To revisit your recent pages up to seven days back, hit the Recents icon on the top right corner of the homepage or to the right of the “G” button centered alongside the bottom.
* Previously, your recently visited pages were available for 24 hours.
* They also added a new Forward button and voice search now works better in noisy environments. Google also mentioned that local search results for gas stations now include gas prices, with hotel search now providing useful information about amenities such as Wi-Fi, gyms, pool, laundry service and so forth.
* Grab Google for iOS for free from the App Store.
