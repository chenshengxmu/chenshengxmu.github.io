* The iPhone 4S is better than its predecessor in several ways. It has a faster processor, better camera, and of course the popular new Siri feature. And apparently, all of these upgraded components have affected the new iPhone’s battery life.
* Reports have been pouring in over the last few days regarding the new handset’s poor battery performance. Some folks believe that the device’s battery isn’t living up to the expectations Apple set. So iLounge decided to do some investigating…
* In the midst of its exhaustive 7 page review, iLounge talks about the iPhone 4S’ battery life. The site performed several tests on multiple handsets (including the iPhone 4), and the results might just surprise you.

* In the end, it appears that the iPhone 4S’ battery life really depends on your individual usage. Here is what iLounge concluded from its experiment:
* “If you spend much of your day near a Wi-Fi network and only rely upon the iPhone 4S for web browsing and phone calling, you won’t notice a major difference—unless you’re thinking of switching to Sprint, in which case we’d be a little concerned. Similarly, if you use 3G data, plan to record or play videos, or want to listen to hours of audio during the day, you can expect greater battery drain from the iPhone 4S.”
* It’s not surprising that the iPhone 4S uses more power while shooting movies or surfing the web on 3G, considering both of those areas received major upgrades on this year’s handset (8MP 1080p, HSPA+). But it’s interesting that none of the devices reached the projected 6 hour mark for web browsing on 3G.
* If you’re looking for a way to squeeze a little more juice out of your new iPhone’s battery, you might try checking out some of these battery-saving tips. Apple also has a support page setup with some useful pointers.
* How is your iPhone 4S battery compared to your previous handset?
