* The UK smart home company Hive has released their latest product, a stylish home security camera known as the Hive View.
* This tiny camera is all baked into the small cube, that is easily detachable from its base.
* It has a wide 130º field of view, and a built in battery to move it around your home for periods of time.
* It requires no hub or bridge to get connected, and can can be setup in minutes via Bluetooth.
* There are two different color options available, and both look pretty great in my opinion.

* For me, the biggest downside is the lack of HomeKit support, though with Apple’s new lax policies, it is always possible it could be added in the future.
* The app gives you 24 hours of video playback, which will be good enough for most people, though if you want to upgrade to 30 days of history, it will cost $5.99 a month.
* Notably, the camera gets its good looks from the designer Yves Béhar, who is known for designing some of the most stunning products out there, including the August Smart Lock.
* There are getting to be many home security camera options out there on the market, but if you would like to pick up the Hive View, you can do so from their website for $199.
