* Yesterday we told you about chpwn’s new jailbreak tweak entitled Zephyr. It’s a tweak that can easily enable iPad-esque multitasking gestures on all iOS devices running iOS 5.
* Inside, we personally demo how easy it is to get multitasking gestures on iOS 5. It’s as simple as jailbreaking your device, and installing chpwn’s excellent tweak. You don’t want to miss this…
* Step 1: Jailbreak your iPhone or iPod touch using RedSn0w. See our tutorial for more details.
* Step 2: Open Cydia and install Zephyr from the BigBoss default repo.
* Step 3: Restart your springboard, and start using multitasking gestures. You can change the way Zephyr works by adjusting the settings found in the Settings app.
* We’ve personally used Zephyr ourselves, and we wholeheartedly approve. It’s very responsive, smooth, and feels like a native Apple implementation. It’s also great for you guys with malfunctioning Home buttons, just in case our Home button “recalibration” trick didn’t work for you.
* At $2.99, Zephyr is a worthwhile purchase, and we can vouch for its awesomeness. Have you tried it out? What did you think?
