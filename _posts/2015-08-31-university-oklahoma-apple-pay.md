* Notch up another victory for Apple’s mobile payment platform as the University of Oklahoma announced Monday that it will begin accepting Apple Pay across its entire campus. The initiative will allow students to pay with Apple Pay using their NFC-enabled devices like the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch at any of the four-hundred service locations scattered across the campus, including restaurants and bookstores.
* “Starting this week, Sooners are now able to pay for items at any one of OU’s 400 point-of-service locations — everywhere from Couch Restaurants to the One University Store and the OU Bookstore,” reads the press release.
* In noting why buying textbooks, technology and food on campus with Apple Pay is cool, the organization amusingly provided the following benefits:
* Apple’s “If it’s not an iPhone, it’s not an iPhone” campaign recently debuted a whole new iPhone 6 commercial which highlights Apple Pay.

* Apple’s boss Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts last month that Apple Pay will soon roll out to more than 700 universities and colleges across the United States, including the University of Kentucky and Auburn University.
* Available in the United States and the United Kingdom and arriving later this year in Canada, China, Australia and other major markets, Apple Pay requires an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus or Apple Watch for in-store purchases.
* In-store Apple Pay transactions are disabled on the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, which support Apple Pay in apps. Owners of older iPhone models from the iPhone 5 onward can pay with Apple Pay through their Apple Watch.
