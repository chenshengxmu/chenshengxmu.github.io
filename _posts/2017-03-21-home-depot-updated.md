* Today saw the release of an updated version of jk9357’s 32-bit jailbreak tool for iOS 9. The jailbreak, which is named Home Depot, was first released several weeks ago with support for a smattering of devices on various firmwares, and we wrote a piece about its launch at the time.
* The updated version is labelled Release Candidate 1, indicating its increasing compatibility and proximity to a final iteration.
* Update: RC 1 had an issue that would cause Cydia to fail to install. All users please download RC 2 instead.
* On the tool’s official site can be found the changelog for today’s release, but I’ll reproduce it here for convenience’s sake. Have a gander:
* As you can see, many of the changes revolve around the tool’s bundled mixtape player, making it more user-friendly and stable. However, a couple of jailbreak-related changes of great importance have also made their way in. The re-extraction of Cydia in the absence of the “/.installed_home_depot” file should prevent a few unwanted restores, and the improved reliability on the iPod touch 5 is also welcome.
* Of course, for most the biggest improvement is in the supported devices list, which now spans every 32-bit device on every iOS version from iOS 9.1-9.3.4 inclusive. This is an impressive support list, and something which was patchy in the original betas due to missing offsets. I myself was forced to restore an iPhone 5c due to issues at this time (though I should add that my iPad 2 running a Home Depot beta version has been as solid as a rock).
* Now however, your device should not encounter these issues no matter the model or firmware version, so now would seem a good time to try out the tool if you’ve been holding out thus far.
* If you’d like to try out the tool, it can be downloaded from the Home Depot website, and side-loaded with Cydia Impactor from Mac, Windows, or Linux. If you need a guide on how to use Impactor, feel free to follow our guide for Yalu, the process will be the same.
* I will definitely be making use of Home Depot RC 1, as soon as my current week’s certificate expires; I’m currently running Home Depot Beta 7.
* Do you have any 32-bit devices on iOS 9.1-9.3.4 which have been awaiting a jailbreak? Are you already using Home Depot, and if so, how are you finding it? Do let me know, in the comments below.
