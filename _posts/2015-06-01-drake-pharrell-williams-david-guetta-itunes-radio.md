* Apple is reportedly in talks with some more A-list names to add as gust DJs to its Beats Music revamp, including Drake, Pharrell Williams and David Guetta, The New York Post learned yesterday.
* These well know names in music should join the likes of BBC Radio 1 DJ personality Zane Lowe who was recently confirmed as leaving the radio giant for a job at Apple in March.
* A deal with Drake alone is said to be worth around $19 million.
* According to the story, Apple is now trying to persuade record labels to offer a three-month free trial for its upcoming subscription-based music service, tentatively named Apple Music that should cost ten bucks per month, price-matching rival Spotify.
* The Cupertino company apparently wants “the moon and the stars” as its position is that the labels should give it rights for free during the three-month trial.
* “As for music publishers, we hear Apple wanted to offer lyrics as part of Apple Music, but didn’t want to pay extra — again, free is nice if you can get it,” reads the story.
* In addition to Toronto-based raper Drake, hip hop artist Pharrell Williams (who touted the Apple Watch on The Voice last month), electronic music DJ David Guetta and former BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe, Apple’s music efforts should be bolstered with a little help from Irish rock band U2, the company’s longtime partner, as well is its in-house roster of talents such as Trent Reznor, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine.
* Apple Music should be formally announced at WWDC next week, barring any unforeseen circumstances.
* The service is said to stream both music and music videos and include artist pages, lyrics, a revamped version of iTunes Radio, iOS Music integration, a YouTube-style sharing section called Apple Connect, an Android app and more.
