* It’s been a week since our last jailbreak tweak recap, and with that in mind, and with that in mind, it’s about time that we make another one.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks released from July 30th to August 5th. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites and then we’ll outline the rest of them afterward.

* Your iPhone comes with display dimming functionality out of the box, but the features provided by Apple leave a lot to be desired.
* Dimid, on the other hand, provides users with a slew of new display dimming options, providing you with the features you might have been desiring for some time.
* In our full review, you can learn more about the types of dimming features the tweak provides and why it’s an improvement over Apple’s stock settings.

* Notchification makes incoming notification alerts more interesting on jailbroken iOS 11 devices, especially the OLED display-equipped iPhone X.
* The tweak includes several animation types that compliment the display when a notification awaits your attention and includes many options for making the animations appear how and when you want them to.
* You can learn more about Notchification and why it’s a great tweak in our full review.

* The AirDrop receiving interface can be somewhat intrusive in iOS. As you begin receiving files, a pop-up appears in the middle of your display and interrupts everything you’re doing. What’s worse is that the pop-up can’t be dismissed without canceling the transfer.
* SilentAir solves this problem by doing away with the intrusive pop-up and implementing a Status Bar-based progress indicator for AirDrop instead. Additionally, the tweak is fully-customizable.
* You can learn more about SilentAir and how it improves the AirDrop receiving feature in iOS in our full review.

* While I enjoy my iPhone X, one of my biggest complaints pertains to App Switcher usage. More specifically, Apple made it to where you need to hold down on an application card before you can swipe up on any to force-close them.
* No other iPhones or iPads provide this workflow interruption as the iPhone X does, and that’s why a new free jailbreak tweak called SwipeUptoKillX is so essential for iPhone X users.
* With this tweak, you’ll be able to swipe up on the App Switcher’s application cards on the iPhone X to force-close them, just like any other iOS handset.
* You can learn more about SwipeUptoKillX and where to get it in our full review.
