* Compass 2, a compact, ultra-portable iPad stand from the United States-based premium accessory vendor Twelve South, is now available in two new colorways to match your Gold or Rose Gold Apple tablet. The accessory is designed to work with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and all generations of the iPad Air and iPad mini, in both landscape and portrait mode. The new Gold and Rose Gold editions of the Compass 2 are now available for $39.99 a pop each on Amazon and via Twelve South’s web store.
* The multipurpose stand offers a convenient locking rear leg for hands-free desktop use or flip down the secondary leg and it becomes a comfortable typing stand. It’s the perfect companion for those who prefer to travel light due to its small footprint and the ability to fold it flat.
* The Compass 2 is crafted from heavy gauge steel and geometrically designed to feature a tall, wide base angle and tips covered in soft protective silicone to keep your iPad in pristine condition and keep it from shifting.

* As I wrote in my Compass 2 review, this stand lets you use your iPad as a display or as a hands-on tablet. In addition to the new Gold and Rose Gold options, the Compass 2 remains to be available in existing Silver and Space Gray finishes.
