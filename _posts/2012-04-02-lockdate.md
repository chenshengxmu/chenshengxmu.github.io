* Interested in customizing the look of your Lock screen’s date display? Then look no further than LockDate — a tweak exclusively devoted to customizing the date reading on your iPhone’s Lock screen.
* With LockDate you can alter the date’s font, color, style, and much more. There is also a provision to incorporate alternate calendar types and switch to them by swiping on the date with your finger.
* LockDate certainly isn’t a tweak that will find an audience with everyone one, but there’s sure to be someone who is interested in this niche…
* If you’re compelled to try LockDate after watching our walkthrough, simply take your jailbroken iPhone over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can acquire it free of charge.
* If you decide that LockDate is the tweak for you, then please feel free to sound off in our comments section with your thoughts about it.
