* Photo-sharing service Instagram today announced an update for its direct messaging feature, called Direct, which now combines auto-dissapearing photos and videos along with your text conversations in a single thread. Previously, disappearing photos and videos were separated under their own Stories bar at the top of the Direct section. A redesigned Direct feature is rolling out today via Instagram’s version 10.16 update.
* “Texts and reshares will now appear in the same thread with disappearing photos and videos so you can seamlessly go back and forth with your friends,” says the company.
* New disappearing messages in your Direct inbox are highlighted in blue to distinguish them from the text conversations. Tapping a disappearing message will replay it once and the sender will be notified if you replay or screenshot the message.
* Instagram’s video seen below shows off the new Direct feature in action.
* To send a disappearing photo or video via Direct:
* 1) Swipe left into Direct and tap the new blue camera icon at the bottom to take a disappearing photo or video, or tap the blue camera icon in an existing thread. Like before, swiping right from the feed will take you directly to the camera.
* 2) Tap the arrow to send it to individual friends or groups of friends.
* 3) Keep track of who has seen your message through notifications within the thread.

* Instagram noted that texts, uploads and reshares still work the same way.
* The company says the number of people using Direct has grown from 300 million in November 2016 to 375 million.

* Instagram for iOS is a free download from App Store.
