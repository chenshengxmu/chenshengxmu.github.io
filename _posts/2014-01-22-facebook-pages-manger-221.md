* Facebook has posted an update for its Pages Manager this afternoon, bringing the app to version 2.2.1. The update includes bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as a new feature for scheduling photo posts.
* For those unfamiliar with Facebook’s Pages Manager, it allows admins to interact with their audiences and keep tabs on activity for their pages by doing things like viewing Insights and replying to private messages…
* Here’s the change log for version 2.1.1:
* New in 2.2.1: – Schedule photo posts – Bug fixes and performance updates New in 2.2: – Optimized for iOS 7 – Tag other Pages in sharing tool – Tag people in comments
* The new scheduling feature seems like a handy addition, and but fixes and performance improvements are always welcome. If you manage a Facebook Page, you’ll want to grab this new version from the App Store for free.
* Today’s release comes a little over a month after Pages Manager received its big 2.2 update. That release brought about a number of changes including a new design for iOS 7 and the ability to tag pages in posts and comments.
