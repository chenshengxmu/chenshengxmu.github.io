* If you’ve already watched the WWDC 2014 keynote, then you won’t see anything new here, but for those of you who haven’t, Apple just published the Yosemite design video it showed last week. Titled “The New Look of OS X Yosemite,” this short video puts the spotlight on Yosemite’s new buttons, font type, icons, use of translucency, as well various other visual elements of OS X Yosemite.
