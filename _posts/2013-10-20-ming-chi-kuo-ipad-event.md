* Typically, when you see the words ‘analyst’ and ‘predictions’ in the same sentence on a tech site, you get a free pass to roll your eyes. Let’s face it, the credibility for the majority of analysts is pretty low, thanks to crazy predictions like the iRing.
* But there’s one man who seemingly stands out among the crowd: Ming-Chi Kuo. The KGI Securities analyst is right more often than not, so when he speaks, people listen. And he just seeded some last-minute forecasts for this week’s iPad event…
* MacRumors has the note:

* Kuo goes on to say that he doesn’t expect Apple to include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, nor a gold color option, in either iPad line this year. He says components for these features are still being prioritized for the iPhone 5s, limiting supplies.
* The good news, though, is that the analyst agrees with reports claiming that the new iPad mini will sport a hi-res Retina display. But unfortunately, he also agrees with recent speculation that the new mini will be tough to find at launch time.
* If you’d like to grade Kuo on his accuracy, save this post and reexamine it on Tuesday afternoon, after Apple’s iPad event is over. Until then, feel free to check out our own predictions. The event is scheduled to kick off at 10am PST on the 22nd.
