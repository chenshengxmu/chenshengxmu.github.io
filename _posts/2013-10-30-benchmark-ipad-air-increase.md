* There were two recurring themes in the first round of iPad Air reviews that began hitting the web late last night: the tablet has substantially decreased in size (that includes weight, thickness, etc.), and dramatically increased in speed.
* While we will probably have to wait until we go hands-on to really understand the former claim, the latter can be seen in initial benchmark testing. Early GeekBench results show the Air outperforming its predecessor by a huge margin…

* AppleInsider points to a blog post from John Poole of performance analytics firm Primate Labs, who has compiled all of the GeekBench test results for the iPad Air. And as you can see in the chart above, its performance is very impressive.
* Poole offers up some observations on the data:
* To address this last point, we’ve come to the conclusion that Apple is still selling the iPad 2 at $399 because people are still buying it. Data shows that the device accounted for over 20% of the company’s tablet sales during the last quarter.
* Otherwise, we agree with everything here. Although we tend to give benchmark test results a bit of an asterisk, there’s no denying the fact that the iPad Air’s performance is a significant improvement over the fourth generation of the tablet.
* The big question for us, though, is how well will this added performance translate into real-world usage. And to answer it, we’ll have to wait until the iPad Air goes on sale to the public on Friday. We can’t wait to get our hands on this thing.
