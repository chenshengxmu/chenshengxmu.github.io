* As of today’s big launch announcement, Apple now has four really powerful smartphones in its lineup, not including the entry-level iPhone 5s. At the lower end of the totem poll, there’s the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. At the top of the lineup are the just-announced iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* How do all of these devices compare? What about things like battery life, size, and weight? In this comparison post, I’ll breakdown the differences between each of Apple’s iPhone offerings.

* First, lets consider what many people consider to be the most important factor–power and battery life. Unsurprisingly, the larger battery contained in both the 6 Plus and 6s Plus allows for increased battery life over their smaller siblings.
* For example, the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus feature up to 24 hours of talk time over 3G, while the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s feature only 14 hours of talk time.
* The same trend continues with standby time. The larger versions of Apple’s smartphone line get over two weeks of standby time on a single charge, while the more diminutive versions get up to 10 days max.

* Again, similar patterns can be gleaned from Internet use over 3G, LTE, and Wi-Fi, with the 6 Plus and 6s Plus yielding 1-2 hours of additional performance.
* The larger devices are capable of up to 14 hours of HD video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback. The lesser-sized iPhone had 11 hours of video playback and 50 hours of audio playback.
* There’s nothing really surprising about this report. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have more space for a larger battery. More battery = longer battery life. With this noted, comparisons between the two devices, the iPhone 6s Plus and the iPhone 6 Plus, were exactly the same. That same thing can be said for comparisons between the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6.

* Now lets consider something that doesn’t get as much fanfare as battery life, but still very much matters in day to day usage—weight and dimensions.
* Obviously, the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus are substantially larger and heavier than their smaller siblings, but lets break down the weight and size differences between both big devices and both smaller devices.
* The new iPhone 6s Plus weighs 6.77 ounces. Last generation’s iPhone 6 Plus weights 6.07 ounces. So if we do the math on that…
* ((6.77-6.07)/6.07)*100 = 11.5% increase in weight.
* When you’re talking about mere ounces, that’s not really a lot, but for a device that you hold all of the time, there’s bound to be somewhat of a noticeable difference, even if it’s as subtle as all get out.
* Now let’s compare the iPhone 6s and the last-generation iPhone 6. The iPhone 6s weighs 5.04 ounces, and the iPhone 6 weighs 4.55 ounces. Again, let’s do the math…
* ((5.04-4.55)/4.55)*100 = 10.8% increase in weight.
* Both devices feature roughly a 11% increase and weight when compared to the models that they replace.
* When it comes to dimensions, things are a bit more imperceptible. There’s definitely a dimension increase with the new models, but they would probably go unnoticed by most.
* The iPhone 6s Plus is 6.23 inches tall, while the last-generation iPhone 6 Plus is 6.22 inches tall. That makes for about a 0.2% difference in height. Again, nearly imperceptible, unless you happen to be a laser cut case maker.

* Likewise, the width between the 6s Plus and 6 Plus is a small difference, just 0.3%.
* Depth will be slightly more noticeable due to the device’s overall shallowness, yet it’s still a very small difference. The calculated depth percentage difference is about 3.4%.
* You can expect the iPhone 6 versus iPhone 6s to yield similar results.
* With these changes in dimensions in mind, it’s quite possible that your current iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus case won’t properly fit your new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. It might be able to squeeze in there, but if it’s a high quality case with super-precise schematics, then chances are it may have a problem, especially if it’s not made out of a flexible material like silicon.
* What do you think bout the size and dimension comparisons between Apple’s next-gen and last-gen iPhones? Is there anything that particularly stands out to you?
