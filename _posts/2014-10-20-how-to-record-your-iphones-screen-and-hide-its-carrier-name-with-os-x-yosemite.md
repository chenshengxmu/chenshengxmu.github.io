* I’ve been asked a lot of times on Twitter how I was able to hide my iPhone’s carrier name on iOS. There really is no trick involved, I was simply using my Mac’s iPhone screen recording feature. Indeed, macOS has the ability to capture real-time video of your iPhone or iPad’s screen out of the box. This feat is accomplished by a new option in the QuickTime app.
* Using the screen record option in the QuickTime app results in a uniformed status bar on the iPhone. It hides the carrier name, and sets the time to 9:41 for a clean looking status bar while recording. Of course, this change isn’t permanent, as some might at first assume, but it’s a great way to capture clean looking video of your iPhone or iPad.
* In this guide, I will show you how to record a video of your iPhone screen. Note that this works the same to record the screen of your iPad.
* To record your iPhone screen, your device must be connected to your Mac with a Lightning cable. You must also be running iOS 8.0 or later on your iPhone or iPad.
* Launch the QuickTime app on your Mac , and click File → New Movie Recording. Use the drop-down menu on the QuickTime video output screen to select your device under the Camera heading. You can then select your microphone input, which can include any microphones you have connected to your Mac, your Mac’s internal microphone, or the iPhone or iPad’s microphone. Once you have everything setup, click the record button to commence recording.
* Once the recording is completed, click the record button again to stop recording. You can then use the File → Save dialogue to save your screen recording to your desktop.
* This is by far one of my favorite features in macOS, because I often take screen captures of my iOS devices. The QuickTime app in OS X Yosemite makes it all the more easier, because I can do so with a simple Lightning connection between my Mac and my iOS device.
* What do you think?
