* As promised, Facebook is bringing Screen Time-like tools to its mobile app and Instagram.
* The updates are rolling out soon on the mobile Instagram and Facebook apps.
* According to the company:
* We want the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram to be intentional, positive and inspiring. Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them.

* Set a daily reminder to be alerted when you’ve reached the amount of time you’d like to spend on the app for that day. The daily reminder is found right below the dashboard, as evidenced by the screenshots above—change or cancel it at any time.
* Not being inundated with alerts you don’t care about is another effective way of improving one’s digital wellbeing. Tapping the Notification Settings link in the dashboard takes you to a new Mute Push Notifications setting in either app. This will limit your Facebook or Instagram notifications for a period of time (fifteen minutes to eight hours) when you need to focus.
