* Mophie’s Helium series of battery-extending cases for Apple’s iPhone 5 are a no-brainer for power users who can’t get through their day on a single charge. The California-based accessory maker offers the Helium cases in three flavors: the 13 percent thinner standard-edition Juice Pack Helium with a 1,500mAh battery, the even thinner Juice Pack Air (just 0.63-inches thick) with a bigger 1,700mAh built-in battery and the latest Juice Pack Plus which rocks a 2,100 mAh battery, good for an additional ten hours of 3G/LTE talk time/web use.
* And now, in time for Apple’s September 10 big reveal of the colorful iPhone 5S/5C, Mophie has introduced a burst of color options…
* The Juice Pack Helium Spectrum Collection for the iPhone 5 takes the original Helium case’s 1,500mAh battery and repackages it into five distinct color options: blue, purple, pink, green and red. The new colors feature a matte finish and jewel tone.
* Also found on these cases: a standby switch, LED power indicator, microUSB charging port, 3.5mm audio jack, holes to access to all your iPhone 5 hardware buttons and a forward-facing speakers which redirects sound from the bottom of the phone toward the user.
* Like the original Helium, the new Spectrum Collection is thirteen percent thinner than any of Mophie’s previous iPhone juice packs.
* “It’s so thin, you won’t believe there’s a battery inside,” the company boasts.
* In case you were wondering, the built-in 1,500mAh battery delivers 80 percent more battery life to your iPhone 5 – enough for an addition six hours of usage – while providing edge-to-edge protection against the drops, bumps and scratches.
* No, they don’t offer a champagne option.
* You can purchase the new Juice Pack Helium Spectrum Collection over at Mophie’s web store or through Apple’s US online store, priced at $79.95 a pop.
