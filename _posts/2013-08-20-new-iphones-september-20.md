* The iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C will launch in Japan on September 20, according to a report from prominent Japanese business newspaper Nikkei. That falls on a Friday, 10 days after the handsets are expected to be unveiled.
* The date makes sense, based on Apple’s past history. The company typically launches its new iPhones in the United States and a handful of international markets on the Friday of the following week after they’re announced…
* CNET summarizes the Nikkei report:
* “SoftBank and KDDI will handle sales of the iPhone 5S and 5C, according to Japan’s largest business daily. NTT Docomo is not expected to sell the new iPhones, Nikkei added.
* The U.S. announcement is expected on September 10, the report noted.
* In addition to the conventional black and white models, a new “champagne gold” will be offered, the newspaper said.”
* In addition to reinforcing claims of a new ‘champagne gold’ colorway, Nikkei also reaffirms reports that the 5S will come with an upgraded processor and camera, as well as a fingerprint sensor integrated into the Home button.

* The report doesn’t speak directly to the iPhone 5C, but we have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The handset will be made of plastic, come in various colors, feature specs similar to the iPhone 5, and priced around $300.
* If everything holds up, we should see these two phones make their debut at an Apple event on Tuesday, September 10. And if they really do launch in Japan the following Friday, they should be available here in the US as well.
