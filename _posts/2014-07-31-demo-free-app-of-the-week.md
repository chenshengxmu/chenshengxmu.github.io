* Apple has just named Deemo, by Rayark, its App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the popular game for both iPhone and iPad, for free—a decent savings of $2.
* For those who haven’t played it before, Deemo is kind of a hybrid rhythm and fantasy title. You play as the mystic character Deemo, who must help a lost little girl return home to her world by playing music on a magical piano…

* Here’s a little backstory on the game:
* Rayark brings you Deemo, a hybrid of music rhythm game and the story of urban fantasy, with hand-drawn art, story-telling gallery and real instrumental feedback of piano key sound.
* Deemo is a mystic character lives in solitude, a castle, all by itself. A little girl falls from the sky, not knowing who she is, where she comes from. To help the little girl back to her world, Deemo comes to realize a tree keeps growing tall on top of the piano whenever it plays. What will Deemo do when it gets comfortable with the companionship it never had before? What if the little girl can’t deal with the truth when her seemingly lost memories regained?!
* And a list of some of its top features:
* And finally, a video showing gameplay:
* Admittedly, I’m not usually into the fantasy genre, but I do like rhythm games and that aspect of Deemo is pretty fun. It kind of reminds me of the Tap Tap franchise by Tapulous, which was essentially touch versions of Guitar Hero.
* If you want to check it out for yourself, you can find Deemo in the App Store for free for both the iPhone and iPad. It’s worth noting that there are a handful of $3.99 in-app purchases, but not buying them shouldn’t affect gameplay.
