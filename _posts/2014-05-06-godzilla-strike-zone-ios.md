* Warner Bros has unleashed its Godzilla movie tie-in unto the App Store. Titled Godzilla: Strike Zone, this iOS game invites you to join a squadron of military heroes who must face the mighty Godzilla, a kaiju-class monster that has become something of an international pop culture icon starring in nearly three dozen feature films.
* The game implements a few memorable scenes from the upcoming movie that premiers in theaters on May 16, like a high-altitude sky jump where you air-drop into a devastated San Francisco.
* The iPhone and iPad title is available free of charge in the App Store, no in-app purchases required whatsoever…

* The game is basically a series of first-person rescue missions where you must evacuate survivors and kill the baddies.
