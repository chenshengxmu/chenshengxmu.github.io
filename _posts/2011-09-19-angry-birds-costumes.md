* With Halloween around the corner, the annual dilemma comes back: what costume am I gonna wear? This year, looking at those Angry Birds costumes, my decision process might be streamlined.
* Selling for $30-$40, you can pick from all your favorite birds: black, red, yellow. You can even a King Pig costume…
* The only thing stopping me from wearing that at Halloween is that I might look like a total dork. Don’t you think?
