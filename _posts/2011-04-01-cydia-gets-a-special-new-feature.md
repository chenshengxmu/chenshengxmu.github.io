* If you loaded up Cydia today to peruse the latest selection of jailbreak tweaks and apps available to download, you might have rubbed your eyes a bit to make sure you weren’t seeing things.
* Yep, Cydia got a special new feature, and no doubt for a limited time only. It’s called the QuickBar. Yes, that QuickBar.
* It looks like Twitter’s panned QuickBar made the move from Twitter’s official iPhone app to Cydia.
* Don’t believe us? Check it out for yourself, or take a look at the proof inside…

* Interestingly enough, it’s actually functional. If you tap Cydia’s QuickBar, it will go to the item in question, whether it be a theme, tweak, or whatever.
* Obviously (hopefully) this is nothing more than an elaborate joke by our friend saurik, the man behind Cydia.
* Otherwise, we’d probably be seeing a jailbreak tweak that got rid of the QuickBar in Cydia. Wouldn’t that be ironic.
* Were you fooled by Saurik’s joke on the jailbreak community?
