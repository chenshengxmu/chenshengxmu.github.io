* A rumor involving an Apple-branded electric vehicle that The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal threw their weight behind just took an interesting turn with a Reuters report Saturday offering additional tidbits.
* The news gathering organization learned from sources that Apple’s electric vehicle is actually an autonomous self-driving car. Apple is reportedly actually “exploring how to make an entire vehicle” rather than just designing automotive software as previously suspected.
* The story, however, contradicts The Wall Street Journal which said last evening that developing a self-driving car was not part of Apple’s effort.
* “They don’t appear to want a lot of help from carmakers,” the source who declined to be named told Reuters.
* Another automotive source told Reuters that Apple “is learning” how to make a self-driving electric car and “is gathering advice” from experts at carmakers and automotive suppliers on parts and production methods.
* The company isn’t interested in combustion engine technology or conventional manufacturing methods, the story notes.
* As previously reported, last September Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, who specialized in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences.
* During his tenure at Daimler from March 2009 to September 2014 Jungwirth oversaw Connected Car & UI Telematics, Autonomous Driving, Advanced User Experience Design, Powertrain & eDrive, Advanced Exterior Design and Mercedes Benz style, group research and regulatory affairs, according to his LinkedIn profile.
* Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple’s boss Tim Cook approved Project Titan about a year ago, putting product design Vice President Steve Zadesky in charge.
* A former Ford engineer, Zadesky has been a long time Apple employee who helped create the iPod and later the iPhone, and is now said to have created a 1,000-people automotive team at a secret location separate from Apple’s main campus.
