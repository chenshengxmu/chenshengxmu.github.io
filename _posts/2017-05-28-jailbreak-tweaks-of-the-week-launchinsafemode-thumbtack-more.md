* The week has been pretty slow for jailbreak tweaks in general, and as the week comes to an end, we ritualistically follow up with another roundup to tie up the loose ends.
* In this piece, we’ll discuss our favorite jailbreak tweak releases in detail first, and then outline the rest of them afterwards.
* LaunchInSafeMode – FREE

* Because jailbreak tweak that modify third-party apps directly are becoming more common, there’s always room for error that could cause certain functions in a particular app to act spazzy.
* Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called LaunchInSafeMode lets you launch apps from your Home screen while being unaffected by jailbreak tweaks. To do this, simply 3D Touch on the app from the Home screen and choose the Safe Mode option.
* In doing so, you can find out whether a problem you’re having with an app is being caused by a tweak you’ve installed or something else.
* You can learn more about how LaunchInSafeMode can be used in our full review.
* Thumbtack – FREE

* Chances are that you jot things down in the Notes app when you want to remember them, and it’s also likely that some of your notes are more important than others are.
* If this is the case for you, then a tweak called Thumbtack could be incredibly useful, as it lets you pin important notes to the top of the Notes app.
* Pinned notes are indicated by a little red thumbtack icon to the left of the note description, so they’re much easier to discern from regular notes.
* You can read our full review of Thumbtack to learn more about why this tweak is a must-have.
