title: The Price of Turning Your Verizon iPhone into a Mobile Hotspot
---
* I guess the most exciting thing about the Verizon iPhone’s announcement this morning was the fact that you will be able to use your iPhone as a hotspot for up to 5 devices. This means you’ll be able to turn your Verizon iPhone into a hotspot and share your Internet connection with up to 5 devices around you.
* Sounds great, right? It is great. Not so great is that the pricing information has been left aside and no one at Verizon deemed it necessary to let people know how much this great feature will cost…

* iDB reader soccerkrzy left a comment on the blog with a link to Verizon’s pricing page for the mobile hotspot feature. According to their website, turning your iPhone into a hotspot will cost you an additional $20/month, including 2GB of data, with each additional GB priced at $20.
* Yesterday, we reported that the rumor going around was that Verizon would offer an unlimited data plan for $30. This hasn’t been confirmed, neither has the cost of Mobile Hotspot. I guess we’ll find out sooner rather than later, but something tells me that if Verizon didn’t make a public announcement about the iPhone 4 pricing plan, it’s probably because it’s not as good as we’d hope.
* Time will tell.
