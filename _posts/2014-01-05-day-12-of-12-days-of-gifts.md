* It’s day 12, and what we assume to be the final day, of the big 12 Days of Gifts event. Apple has removed Mr. Crab and has posted a new item for download. Today’s free gift is an EP (or extended play) from the English rock band The Rolling Stones.
* The band really needs no introduction. These guys have been making music for over 50 years, and are ranked #8 on the “Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists” chart. They’re legends, and widely considered one of the best rock bands that ever lived…
* From the iTunes description:
* “By the time the Rolling Stones began calling themselves the World’s Greatest Rock & Roll Band in the late ’60s, they had already staked out an impressive claim on the title. As the self-consciously dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock.”
* The EP is titled ‘Sweet Summer Sun, Live in Hyde Park 2013,’ and it includes 3 songs from The Rolling Stones’ live performance at the famous London venue last summer: Beast of Burden, Tumbling Dice, and Doom & Gloom. Total run time is 13.5 minutes.

* I imagine a lot of folks are going to see this as a disappointing, or anti-climactic end to Apple’s 12 Days of Gifts event. But I also think that a lot of fans are going to be happy to grab these free songs from one of the band’s most memorable performances.
* If you want to check it out for yourself, you can grab the 12 Days of Gifts app (for the iPhone and iPad) in the App Store for free. Keep in mind that the download will only be available for 24 hours, and it can vary depending on your country or region.
