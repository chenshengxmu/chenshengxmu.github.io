* Good news for those of you missing out on today’s iOS 8 festivities in order to save your jailbreak, the PanguTeam says it’s on the case. As part of a PSA yesterday to remind users to jailbreak while still possible, the team confirmed it has already begun work on hacking the new firmware.
* Now before you go getting your hopes up, note that just because an iOS 8 jailbreak is being worked on, does not mean we will see one anytime soon. This is, however, more intel than we had a few days ago, and it may be pertinent to those deciding on whether or not to update to iOS 8.
* Here’s the message that was posted on Weibo:

* Roughly translated, the message from the PanguTeam says “[Reminder] Just 1 day before iOS 8 official release, guess that devices except iPhone 4 can’t be restored with 7.1.2 firmware. If you want to jailbreak please grab the last moment. For iOS 8, we are already on the way…”
* Apple seeded iOS 8 earlier today, and it’s by far the company’s most-open iOS release to date. Some feel its addition of third-party Touch ID, widget and extension support could be detrimental to the jailbreak community, but others see these things as hotbeds for new, innovative tweaks.
* Stay tuned.
* Thanks Chan!
