* As noted in last week’s iPhone 6s keynote, Apple will be significantly upping the value of its iCloud storage plans by providing much more storage for the money. Apple will be keeping around its free 5GB tier, but it’s upping the amount of storage provided by its $0.99 tier by 30GB, and reducing the price of its highest $19.99 tier.
* If you go to the iCloud section of the Settings app today and select the Upgrade iCloud Storage option, you’ll still see the old pricing setup. This has left many to ask the question: when will the new iCloud storage pricing go live? An iCloud user who recently reached out to Apple support thinks they have the answer.

* According to user z4cyl on reddit, Apple will be launching its new iCloud Storage plans on September 25th, the same day that the new iPhone 6s launches.
* Here is a screen grab of a chat that z4cyl says he had with an Apple Support rep:

* While we obviously can’t say with 100% certainty that the new storage pricing will go live on the 25th, there’s really nothing to gain by saying otherwise. We know for sure that the new storage pricing will be launching soon, and launching on the same day as the new iPhones kind of makes sense.
* What do you think about these new plans? Which one will you choose?
