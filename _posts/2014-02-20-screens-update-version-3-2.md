* Popular VNC client Screens updated its iPhone and iPad application today, bringing it to version 3.2. The update brings about a handful of new features and a number of improvements including better URL scheme and Retina display support.
* As for the new features, the app now has a trackpad mode, which—as the name suggests—allows you to control the mouse cursor on your computer as you would with a standard trackpad. And it’s also gained support for your iCloud Keychain…
* Here is the 3.2 change log:
* NEW:  – Trackpad Mode: Control your computer like a trackpad instead of using touch-based gestures.  – Manage your Screens Connect records from the app.  – iCloud Keychain support.  – Dvorak hardware keyboard support. 
* IMPROVEMENTS:  – Improved remote Retina display support.  – Improved URL scheme support.  – Now displays 3 columns on iPad instead of 2.  – Page Up, Down and arrow keys will now auto-repeat.  – Fixed SSH key pasteboard import.  – Many bug fixes, improvements and optimizations.
* If you’ve never used Screens before, it’s worth checking out. It just received a major update last December, and the developers continue to add new features. I’m a Splashtop user myself, but I continue to hear great things about this beautiful VNC client.
* At any rate, if you’re interested, you can find the latest version of Screens in the App Store for $19.99. It works for both the iPhone and iPad, but you’ll need to make sure you download and install the desktop client (for Mac or Windows) for the app to work.
