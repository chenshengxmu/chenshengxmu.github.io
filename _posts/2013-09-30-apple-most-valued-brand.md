* Apple has overtaken Coca-Cola as the new most valuable brand in the world, according to a new report from brand consulting firm Interbrand. The move puts an end to the beverage company’s 13-year reign as #1.
* The firm calculates that the Apple brand is worth in upwards of $100 billion. And it says that its ‘ethos’ played a big factor in why the iPad-maker was able to beat out other tech companies like Google and Samsung…
* From Interbrand’s report via The New York Times:
* “Every so often, a company changes our lives, not just with its products, but also with its ethos. This is why, following Coca-Cola’s 13-year run at the top of Best Global Brands, Interbrand has a new #1—Apple. Few brands have enabled so many people to do so much so easily, which is why Apple has legions of adoring fans, as evidenced by the record-breaking launch of the iPhone 5c/5s. For revolutionizing the way we work, play, and communicate—and for mastering the ability to surprise and delight—Apple has set a high bar for aesthetics, simplicity, and ease of use that all other tech brands are now expected to match, and that Apple itself is expected to continually exceed. 
* From our perspective, Apple’s internal brand strength has remained steady. CEO Tim Cook has assembled a solid team that is aligned around the Apple vision, which has allowed them to deliver against the promise time and time again. There’s been a lot of change at the top in the last 12 months, but the alignment of both hardware and software design under Jonathan Ive is a major step toward maintaining focus. A shrewd move, perhaps, given the stiffer than ever competition over the last 12 months.”
* Google was named second most valuable brand, behind Apple. And Coca-Cola—which previously held the top spot for more than a decade—was bumped to third place, just ahead of IBM, with a valuation of $79.2 billion.
* Although you wouldn’t know it by looking at its stock price, Apple is having a huge couple of months. It just introduced two new iPhones—of which it quickly sold 9 million units—and it’s set to unveil new iPads in October.
