* MobileTerm Backgrounder is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to maintain a persistent connection to the Mobile Terminal app. If you’ve used Mobile Terminal in the past, then you know how frustrating it can be to close out of the app, return, and all of your previous data disappears. MobileTerm Backgrounder is a tweak that works with the jailbroken Mobile Terminal app, and it makes it much easier to continue where you left off when switching between apps. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside to see its ins and outs.
* There are no settings to configure for MobileTerm Backgrounder. Obviously, you’ll need the Mobile Terminal app in order to take advantage of what it offers. Both MobileTerminal and MobileTerm Backgrounder can be had free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’re a regular user of the terminal emulator on iOS, then please sound off with your thoughts in the comments below.
