* This has been a great week for discounts on great apps and games. We saw Tydlig drop in price to zero from $2.99 and the exciting arcade runner Atom Run is this week’s Free App Of The Week. There were some sweet updates as well, like Vine’s new camera roll upload feature and the SoundHound-Rdio integration.
* We also saw the launch of some fantastic new titles. If you are looking for some great new content for your iPhone, we’ve got a great list of new apps and games for you to check out this weekend.

* I’ve been using the first version of this amazing app for years and have loved every single feature of it. The new version has been rebuilt from the ground up with a fantastic design, better graphics, and tons of awesome features that teach you as much as a college astronomy course could. You can see the night sky, even during the day, read up on active meteor showers, and even get a closer look at stars, constellations, and nebulas with an interactive 3-D view. Activate the Time Machine to see how the stars above will rotate tonight. This app is available for $2.99.

* PAC-MAN just got a makeover for the new generation of gamers. This game was specifically designed for mobile devices and features tilt controls. Journey from one stage to another, gobbling pellets and collecting fruit. Keep away from Blinky and his pals or you’ll be a ghost yourself. Rescue friends to get some help on new levels. PAC-MAN’s buddies can take the fall for you, or even move through ghosts without being detected. This is nothing like the arcade classic you grew up with, but it is the kind of game your kids are going to love. This game is available for $4.99.

* We are always finding ways to exercise our bodies, but our brains need to stay fit, too. This app is designed to help keep your gray matter active with games based on focus, speaking skills, processing speed, memory, math, and more. Keep track of your progress and stay on track with the included workout calendar. Train everyday to boost your energy, increase your intellect, and give you that smug sense of satisfaction knowing that you’ve been working your brain out while your buddies have been wasting away playing video games. This app is available for free.

* Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be an investor for a big fancy firm? Maybe you already are one and know just how stressful the job can be. This game puts you in the hot seat as a trader for a major corporation. Buy and sell on the stock market and even do a little black market trading. Every little thing you do is scrutinized and any mistake you make will destroy your profits. If you play the stocks right, you might just find yourself behind the desk of the company’s chairman. This game is available for $0.99.

* That little curly-topped, big-eyed “adorbs” (I totally just wrote that word. What has happened to me?) little guy is back in an all new gravitational adventure. This time, be prepared for all new game mechanics that will test your skills. Walk around on tiny planets, stuck to the surface thanks to gravity. Jump across to other planets to move around the galaxy. Sacrifice yourself to the Dune-like worm to win. Steer clear of obstacles, like spike platforms and pesky birds. Collect diamonds and keys to earn a “flawless” reputation. This game is available for $1.99.

* From the boardroom to the drag strip, you’ll be living out all of your childhood dreams this weekend. Take charge of a team of Formula One style drivers and do what it takes to make them champions in the motorsport world. Select cars that you want to use to win the Grand Prix. Upgrade your hardware, hire drivers, and invest in technology that will push you to have the fastest team ever. Adjust for changes in the weather, like rain or strong wind. Once your car and driver are on the road, watch the race in real-time with informative details on where everyone is. This game is available for $4.99.

* Almost every one of us knows what it is like to have a crush on someone who just doesn’t seem to notice. Help the mustachio Casanova “Fall” find true love in disguise. Guide him across complex mazes with gravity-defying maneuvers. Rotate your iPhone around to get Fall from one place to another, collecting items for his disguise. Grab hearts along the way and maybe Fall’s inattentive lady friend will be more likely to notice him. As her desires change from mustache to cowboy, help Fall get what he needs to get what he wants. This game is available for $0.99.
