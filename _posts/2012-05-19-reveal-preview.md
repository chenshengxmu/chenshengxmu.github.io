* iOS 5’s upgraded notification system was a welcomed addition to iOS’ repertoire, but as time goes on it’s evident that it can be improved even more so.
* Developers Joshua Tucker and Conrad Kramer have taken matters into their own hands to improve iOS notifications. The result is a tweak that allows you to view the full body of your notifications from the Lock screen or via banner notifications.
* Take a look at the preview video for Reveal inside…
* With Reveal installed, banner notifications are more verbose by means of a horizontal marquee scroll, which enables you to scroll through the body of the entire message.
* Lock screen Notifications received attention as well; now you can scroll vertically to view an entire message, or tap the Lock screen notification to fully expand the table cell.
* Reveal has been submitted to Cydia, and will be available within the next 24 hours for $1.99.
* What do you think?
