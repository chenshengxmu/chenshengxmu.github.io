* When it’s time to plan that family vacation or romantic getaway, there can be a lot of pieces to pull together. You may need a hotel, a flight, a rental car, attraction tickets, or a combination of these. So, the best way to plan and book it is with an app that lets you do it all.
* These best travel apps for iPhone do just that. They let you find and reserve the bookings you need all in one spot.
* Here are a couple of the things we looked for when creating this list of all-in-one iOS travel apps.

* Since its debut in 1996, Expedia has grown to become one of the most trusted and popular travel booking sites. With their mobile app, you can reserve a hotel, flight, and rental car. Plus, you can snag attraction tickets and travel bundles.
* The mobile app lets you keep track of your upcoming trips and add itineraries for travel planned for you by another. Expedia also works with companies like Orbitz and Travelocity, so the apps look almost identical. Overall, for convenient and simple way to plan your next vacation, check out Expedia.

* Kayak is another great travel source providing hotels, flights, and car rentals in its mobile app. The interface is clean and clear. Just select your desired booking and then enter locations, dates, and number of guests. The app searches for you and offers filters and more to help you find exactly what you want.
* Kayak lets you search for hotels, flights, and car rentals without opening an account. But you can book trips and save itineraries if you do sign up and it’s free, making Kayak a good choice.

* TripAdvisor is similar to the other travel apps on this list; however, its offerings are a bit different. You can still search for and book hotels and flights, but not car rentals. Instead, you can reserve a table at a restaurant, buy tickets for attractions, or book a vacation rental. So, if the all-in-one app you want offers these items, then take a look at TripAdvisor.
* TripAdvisor, like the others, lets you track your trips and also includes helpful alerts for your trip planning when you sign up for a free account. If you don’t plan to rent a car during your excursion and prefer to get details on other activities, TripAdvisor is awesome.

* If price is the most important thing when it comes to travel planning, then Priceline is for you. You can book flights and car rentals with the app, but the biggest draw is the deals on accommodations. You can look at all hotels, Express Deals, or Name Your Own Price. With a free account, you can also receive Deals For You.
* Priceline is the ideal app for those who have flexible travel dates with a limited budget. Plus, if a road trip is more your style, you can use the On the Road feature to locate hotels along your route.
* If you want an app that lets you book your entire trip, with where to stay, how to get there, and how to get around while you’re there, these apps have you covered. Hopefully one of them will be the start of a terrific trip for you.
