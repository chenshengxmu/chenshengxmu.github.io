* There’s been no shortage of jailbreak tweaks that allow you to unlock you iPhone in some unique way, but StyleUnlock claims to take the cake when it comes to the stylishness that will ooze from your fingers upon swiping you lockscreen.
* StyleUnlock is a tweak that focuses solely on its primary function — unlocking your iPhone from the lockscreen using multitouch gestures.
* In total, there are over a dozen gestures for you to master, and the following video walkthrough showcases a few of them in action…
* I like StyleUnlock because it doesn’t try to do too much, and the gestures themselves are very precise. I never had a problem unlocking my iPhone with any of the 13 gestures included with the package.
* If you’ve been looking to unlock your iPhone in style, then you simply can’t go wrong with StyleUnlock. It’s free, and it’s available on the BigBoss repo right now for jailbreakers.
* Have you had a chance to try it yet?
