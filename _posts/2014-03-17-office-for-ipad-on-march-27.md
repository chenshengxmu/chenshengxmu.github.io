* Last week, Reuters reported that Microsoft had a full version of its Office suite ready to release for the iPhone and iPad, it just wasn’t sure when the company would pull the trigger. Well it looks like we may have just found the answer: this month.
* According to a pair of scoops by both The Verge and ZDNet, Microsoft has scheduled a March 27 press briefing to discuss “the intersection of cloud and mobile computing.” And it’s going to use the event to launch the long-awaited Office for iPad…
* Here’s The Verge’s Tom Warren with more:
* “Satya Nadella is planning to host his first press event as Microsoft CEO next week. The software maker has been inviting members of the media to a special cloud- and mobile-focused event in San Francisco on March 27th. Nadella is expected to discuss Microsoft’s “mobile first, cloud first” strategy, and there will be some major news ahead of the company’s Build conference in early April. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the event will mark the introduction of Office for iPad.”
* Warren goes on to say that Office for iPad will fully support document creation and editing in all included Office apps. Unfortunately, it sounds like it will require an Office 365 subscription, and offer similar features and UI to the current iPhone version.
* Microsoft is also said to be readying a long-awaited update for its Office suite on the Mac, expected to be released sometime this year, and earlier today, the company launched its note-taking app OneNote in the Mac App Store. It’s free for a limited time.
