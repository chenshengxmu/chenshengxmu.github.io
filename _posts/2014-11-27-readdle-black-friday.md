* Readdle, the Ukrainian developer behind some of the best iOS productivity apps such as Calendars, PDF Expert and Scanner Pro, doesn’t do sales often.
* But when they do, there must be a very good reason and I can’t think of a better reason than Black Friday.
* Starting on Thursday, November 27 and lasting 48 hours only, Readdle’s premium productivity applications are available discounted by up to 50 percent. In addition to discounts on Calendars 5, Scanner Pro, PDF Expert 5, Printer Pro and PDF Converter, their Ultimate Productivity Bundle has been marked down, too.
* The following Readdle applications have been discounted for the next 48 hours (sale ends on Saturday, November 28, at 9am EST):
* This smart mobile calendar experience features natural language input, an easy to use task manager, native iPad interface, offline support, Day, Week, Month and List views of your events, custom recurring events with reminders or SMS alerts, seamless sync across devices, the ability to drag and drop tasks and events, swipe to switch between days and weeks, return to your ‘Today’ schedule with one tap and much more.

* Scan and save digital versions of paper documents like receipts, whiteboards, paper notes or any multipage document using your iOS device’s camera. Email or print your scans, upload them to Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote or any other WebDAV-enabled online storage, sync them with iCloud, create PDFs and more. Scanner Pro uses special algorithms that remove shadows, make scans sharper, correct perspective and make them as readable as possible.
