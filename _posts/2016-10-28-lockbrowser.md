* Web browsers are invaluable tools, but to get to one on your iPhone or iPad, you first need to unlock your device.
* That is, unless you’re using the new LockBrowser jailbreak tweak, which puts a full-blown web browser right on your Lock screen.
* After you install the tweak, you can head over the Settings app and open the LockBrowser preferences pane, which is where you’ll find all the settings you can switch around until you’re satisfied with the look and feel of your Lock screen-based browser:

* You can switch between light and dark modes, set the home page you want, and choose a radius amount for the rounded corners. Once happy, a respring button is included at the bottom of the preferences pane that lets you save your changes.
* When you’re ready to use the web browser, all you do is swipe to the left on your Lock screen. When you do, you’ll see your home page waiting for you in the browser interface:

* You can tap on the URL bar to enter any website URL you want to, or you can use the navigational buttons (back, refresh, home, and forward) at the bottom of the interface to get from webpage to webpage.
* One thing that’s worth pointing out is if you have any content blockers enabled for Safari, they aren’t going to work with LockBrowser.
* On a more positive note, LockBrowser is nice and fast, just like Safari, and it seems to work well with all mobile-friendly websites.
* For the most part, it’s not difficult to unlock your iPhone or iPad to get to Safari in a pinch if you have Touch ID, so I think this tweak will be more valuable to those who don’t want to manually enter a passcode every time they want to use the internet quickly.
* Overall, I think it has one of the better-looking user interfaces when compared to other attempts to bring a web browser to the Lock screen, so if you have always been a fan of this kind of functionality, then I believe this is a great place to start.
* If you want to try LockBrowser, you can download it on your jailbroken device via Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $0.99. The tweak runs on iOS 7-9 devices.
