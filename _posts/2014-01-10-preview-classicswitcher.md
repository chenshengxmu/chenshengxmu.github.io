* ClassicSwitcher is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that brings the old school app switcher to iOS 7. I firmly believe that a lot of jailbreakers out there are going to love this tweak.
* Not only does it bring the old school switcher functionality to iOS 7, but it brings along with it several goodies as well. Weâ€™ve taken ClassicSwitcher for a spin on video, take a look inside for our exclusive hands-on sneak peak.
* And yes, ClassicSwitcher works with the iPad, too.
