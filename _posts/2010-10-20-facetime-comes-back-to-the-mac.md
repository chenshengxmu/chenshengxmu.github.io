title: FaceTime Comes Back To The Mac
---
* Okay, so it was never on the Mac to begin with, but who didn’t see that coming? At Apple’s ‘Back To The Mac’ event this afternoon — or morning, depending on where you call home — FaceTime was announced for Mac OS X.  This means that all of those with iPhone 4’s just got a few million more potential friends to talk to via Apple’s suddenly ubiquitous social service.
* Of course the most exciting news is that FaceTime for the Mac is available for download today.  For your convenience, we’ve included a video demonstrating a FaceTime call between a Mac and an iPhone 4. Check inside for the full details.
* Will you use FaceTime on your Mac?  Do you think its prevalence will change the way we communicate?
