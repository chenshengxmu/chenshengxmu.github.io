* We’ve been following the progress of the Family Guy mobile project since it was first announced last year. The series is one of the most popular on television right now, and many believe the game has the potential to give The Simpsons: Tapped Out a run for its money.
* In fact, the two games will be very similar. TinyCo has said that ‘Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff’ will be a free-to-play title with various resource management elements. And today, the developers offered up even more information on the project along with a new teaser…
* When the Giant Chicken picks a fight with Peter Griffin, Quahog is left in ruins. It’s up to Peter to rebuild it, but he needs your help! Rally your favorite Family Guy characters (even Meg) and save Quahog in this all new adventure from the writers of Family Guy. Or don’t, and regret it forever!
* TinyCo has also said that it is working closely with the original creators of the show to ensure an authentic experience. The game will feature all the voice actors from the series, as well as new animations and new jokes from Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions.
* For more information on the game, click here, or click here if you’d like to see some pre-release screenshots. Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff is slated to launch on April 10, and will support both the iPhone and iPad. Stay tuned, we’ll let you know as soon as it’s available.
