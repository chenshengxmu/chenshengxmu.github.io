* In the market for a waterproof case for your iPhone X? We’ve got you covered. After sifting through hundreds of offerings, we’ve come up with a list of what we feel are the best iPhone X waterproof cases available right now. They’re durable, well-designed and we have options for every budget.
* This can be a bit confusing. The iPhone X is water resistant. It features an IPx7 (you see the IP67 rating a lot; that 6 refers to dust resistance rating) water resistance rating, meaning it can withstand immersion in water up to 3.3 feet (or 1 meter) for up to 30 minutes. So splashes and light rain fall are ok, swimming in the ocean is not.
* The next step up is IPx8, and it’s essentially the highest level of water protection in the IP code (there is a 9K rating for protection against powerful water jets, but it’s not used often in consumer products). This rating certifies that the product is suitable for continuous immersion in water, under conditions specified by the manufacturer.
* If a manufacturer claims their case is waterproof, it’s likely it has an IPx8 rating and it’s been tested to survive set conditions (ex: can be immersed in 2 meters for 1 hour). I know that doesn’t sound “waterproof,” but between a good waterproof case and the water resistance of your iPhone, you should be covered—unless you’re deep sea diving.

* The LifeProof FRĒ is one of the easiest recommendations for me to make on this list. I’ve used LifeProof cases on multiple iPhones, and even used one once to take pictures in the ocean while snorkeling. The FRĒ has an IPx8 water ingress rating, and LifeProof says it can withstand 1 hour in water up to 2 meters deep (6.6 feet). Other features include a built-in screen cover, proper port and button covers, and a 1 year warranty.

* This case from Catalyst is also another easy recommendation. Catalyst has been making waterproof iPhone and Apple Watch cases for years, and I’ve always had good experiences with them. Their iPhone X case has an IPx8 rating, and it can withstand water ingress up to an impressive 10 meters (33 feet). Other features include a wrist lanyard, built-in screen protector, True Sound Acoustics tech, and military grade drop protection.

* Here is a much cheaper option from the lesser-known brand OUNEE. It too features an IPx8 waterproof rating, and the manufacturer said it’s good in over 10 feet of water for up to 1 hour. The case uses the standard front/back design, where two pieces snap together to form a full seal. All the buttons and ports are covered, and for what it’s worth, it has a 4.5 star Amazon rating, on over 250 reviews.

* Prefer a more recognizable brand name? We’ve featured I-Blason on several case roundups over the year because of their reputation for value and quality, and this case looks no different. It has an IPx8 rating, built-in screen protector, and of course all the necessary port/button covers. It also boasts a dual-layer, shock-absorbing design that will keep your phone protected in the event of a drop.

* This isn’t technically a case, but if you’re looking to keep your iPhone X protected from water, this will do the trick. This universal ‘dry bag’ fits all smartphones up to 6-inches and features a clear, touch-enabled window on both the front and back. It’s IPx8 rated, and JOTO says it works in up to 100 feet of water. Has a lanyard and a 4.5-star rating on Amazon, on over 23,000 customer reviews.
* And that should do it! Obviously we will update this list as we are made aware of and test new cases. And as always, if you have any good suggestions that we might have missed, feel free to let us know about them in the comments below and we’ll check them out.
