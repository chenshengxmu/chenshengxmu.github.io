* Having a jailbroken iPhone or iPad means being able to customize it such that it delivers an experience unlike anyone else’s handset, and with a new free jailbreak tweak called Cabello by iOS developer daniel63194, you can do just that.
* Cabello compliments your handset’s hardware buttons with customizable effects, such as custom sounds and haptic feedback. Right out of the box, the tweak lets you configure these parameters for the Home button, volume buttons, and the sleep/wake button.
* After you install Cabello, you’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure its options however you’d like:

* Sounds 
* Haptic Feedback
* At the top right of the preference pane, you’ll notice an “Apply” button. You use this button when you’re finished configuring the tweak to save your changes.
* One thing we like about Cabello is that you can choose to have only custom sounds or just haptic feedback or have both configured simultaneously. That said, you can still enjoy Cabello if you prefer one over the other.
* Notably, there are some device compatibility notes that we want to be straightforward about:
* It’s also worth mentioning that the developer plans to include new sounds and haptic feedback patterns in future updates to the tweak.
* If you’re interested in trying Cabello, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on iOS 11 devices that have been jailbroken with Electra.
