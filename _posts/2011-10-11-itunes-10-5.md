* This is perhaps Apple’s biggest week in its history when it comes to software releases. The Cupertino company is expected to rollout iCloud, iOS 5, and several software updates to make sure everything stays compatible.
* Today, Apple rolled out the first piece of the puzzle: iTunes 10.5. Although it’s been available in beta for developers since June, this is the first time that the public has been given access. What’s new in the software? Hit the jump for the full change log…
* What’s new in iTunes 10.5
* • iTunes in the Cloud. iTunes now stores your music and TV purchases in iCloud and makes them available on your devices anywhere, any time, at no additional cost. • Automatic Downloads. Purchase music from any device or computer and automatically download a copy to your Mac and iOS devices. • Download Previous Purchases. Download your past music, TV, app, and book purchases again, at no additional cost. Previous purchases may be unavailable if they are no longer on the iTunes Store. • Sync with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 5. • Wi-Fi Syncing. Automatically sync your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iTunes any time they’re both on the same Wi-Fi network.
* In case you’re wondering, the new software is jailbreak safe. As noted above, you’ll need iTunes 10.5 to sync any of your iDevices using iOS 5 or iCloud — both of which are expected to drop sometime tomorrow afternoon. We’ll let you know as soon as they hit.
* Any questions?
