* Apple was really proud to unveil its new and improved earbuds, dubbed EarPods, last fall. The company says it spent more than three years designing the headset, and tested a total of 124 different prototypes on over six hundred people, to get the right fit.
* But even with all of that research, it’s inevitable that the EarPods are still not going to fit quite right for some people. And if you happen to be one of those people, you might want to check out these new EarSkinz covers, which promise to fix that for you…
* EarSkinz are essentially tiny plastic covers for your EarPods, strategically molded to make them fit better inside your ear. But that’s not all. In addition to improving the fit of Apple’s earbuds, the accessory also promises to improve the way they sound.
* The developers say that the soft plastic material enhances acoustic clarity by directing sound into your ear canal, and it can also deliver better bass. As far as comfort, the elongated design improves fit and stability, and it even helps to block outside noise.
* Unfortunately, EarSkinz aren’t a real product yet. The team has the design down, but they’ve taken to Kickstarter to try and raise money to start production. At the time of this writing, they’re at about $15,000 of their $20,000 goal with about 10 days left.
* If you’re interested in picking up some EarSkinz, a pledge of just $8 will put your name on the pre-order list. They’ll retail for $10.95. That may seem kind of high, but if they save you from having to buy a new $30 pair of headphones, it’s worth it.
* So, what do you think about EarSkinz?
