* The Dev Team has updated the RedSn0w jailbreak for iOS 4.3.1 to version 0.9.6rc11. The latest version of RedSn0w adds the custom boot logo option we originally saw in GreenPois0n.
* Jailbreaking with RedSn0w is still essentially the same process, but the new “allow boot animation” option gives you the ability to install custom boot logos through Cydia.
* From the Dev Team blog,
* “Those running redsn0w may have noticed we enabled too many Settings options in some versions of the jailbreak (for instance, what you want your side switch to do, even if you have no side switch because you’re not using an iPad).   Release rc10 of redsn0w corrects that (you can just run it over your existing jailbreak…be sure to de-select Cydia to avoid package conflicts).
* Along the way, we’ve also added the option to enable boot animations…these animations can be installed via Cydia, but be sure to select which animation to use via the Settings->Bootlogo setting after you’ve downloaded an animation (and again, you can just run rc10 rc11 over your existing jailbreak…be sure to de-select Cydia to avoid package conflicts).”
* As the Dev Team says, you can use the latest version of RedSn0w on top of your current RedSn0w jailbreak. Simply deselect all of the install options and select the new “Allow boot animation” option. Make sure to de-select “Install Cydia.” That way, you will avoid package conflicts.
* The process of jailbreaking remains the same with the latest version RedSn0w. Check out our tutorial on jailbreaking iOS 4.3.1 with RedSn0w. The untethered jailbreak tool is available on Mac OS X and Windows.
* Head over to our iPhone downloads page to get the latest version of RedSn0w. You can browse for your device’s 4.3.1 firmware from there as well.
* Unlockers need to stay away from RedSn0w and stock iOS firmware from Apple. Check out the latest in unlock news for more information.
* Let us know about your experience with RedSn0w rc11. Did the custom boot logo option work for you?
