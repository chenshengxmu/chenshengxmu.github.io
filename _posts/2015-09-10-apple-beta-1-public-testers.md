* Following the release of iOS 9.1 beta 1 to developers, Apple on Thursday seeded the first beta of iOS 9.1 to public testers. The software is available either over-the-air, for those running the latest iOS 9 beta, or via Apple’s Beta Software Program website.
* As announced yesterday, iOS 9.1 will bring about new features for the just-announced iPad Pro, such as support for Apple’s new Smart Keyboard and Pencil accessories. The update also includes support for Unicode 8, which will add several new emoji.
* Keep in mind that Apple hasn’t released iOS 9 to the public yet, as it’s been in beta since it was introduced in June. The company did release a GM version of the software yesterday, though, and announced that it will be officially available on September 16.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with things, iOS 9 includes a number of reliability and performance improvements, as well as new features. Among those features are Apple’s new News app, enhanced Siri and Maps, and new productivity tools for iPad.
