* Good news for those how prefer to get their entertainment from Amazon instead iTunes. In a newest update to its Instant Video streaming iOS app, the online retail giant has enabled personalized recommendations for movies and television shows based on your past viewing habits, while enhancing the experience with a handy new navigation bar.
* Of course, in order to take advantage of the app you’ll need to be subscribed to Amazon’s Prime, a $79 a year membership which gives you unlimited access to thousands of titles and over 140,000 videos available from the Amazon Instant Video store, with support for Watchlists, offline viewing and more…
* Personalized recommendations have been added to carousels on the homescreen.
* Amazon also revamped the interface by adding a dropdown menu on the homescreen for quick access to dozens of movie and TV collections. A new navigation bar sits on the browse screens, allowing you to find and switch between the different TV and movie collections just as easily.

* A few caveats: the app doesn’t support AirPlay and only streams videos over Wi-Fi, not over a 3G or 4G cellular connection. Downloaded videos can be watched without a Wi-Fi connection, of course.
* The app can be downloaded for free from Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play store for Android.
