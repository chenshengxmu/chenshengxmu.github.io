* According to a sketchy rumor published yesterday by Chinese-language Mydrivers, Apple’s forthcoming 5.5-inch ‘iPhone 7 Plus’ will come with a pair of exclusive features versus its 4.7-inch ‘iPhone 7’ sibling: a new 256-gigabyte storage option and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.
* By comparison, the current-generation iPhone 6s Plus has a 2,750 mAh battery inside. The publication did not specify whether the inclusion of the 256GB option will result in the removal of the oft-critized sixteen-gigabyte option from the iPhone lineup.
* MyDrivers has a poor track record in the rumor business so you’re advised to approach this report with healthy skepticism. My primary concern regarding the larger battery claim is Apple’s insistence of engineering ever thinner devices.
* If the iPhone 7 is going to be iPod touch thin as KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims, a larger battery may not fit inside a thinner enclosure.
* As a matter of fact, Apple put a smaller 2,750 mAh battery inside the iPhone 6s Plus versus the iPhone 6 Plus’s 2,915 mAh one without sacrificing run time due to iOS 9 and A9 chip’s improved power efficiency.
* On top of that, it’s perfectly reasonable to assume that an ‘A10’ chip and iOS 10 will be even more optimized in terms of power consumption.
* For the sake of completeness, the same outlet recently claimed that the rumored ‘iPhone 6c’ will come outfitted with Apple’s in-house designed A9 system-on-a-chip, twice the RAM, Touch ID and a larger 1,642mAh battery (by comparison, the iPhone 5s has a 1,570mAh battery).
