* Mailbox, the popular Dropbox-owned email client, announced this morning that it would be bringing its app to two new platforms: Android and OS X. The Android version will be available later today in the Google Play store, and the team says that the OS X version is “coming soon.”
* First launched on iPhone in February 2013, Mailbox is an email client that syncs up with Gmail, Yahoo Mail and iCloud. It’s not feature-rich, but it stands out thanks to its gesture-based navigation and procrastination features, which let you delay various email actions to a later time…
* Here’s the announcement from Mailbox’s blog:
* First, we are thrilled to introduce Mailbox for Android (available here). We’ve received thousands of requests for an Android app, and after nearly a year of work we’re excited to bring the simplicity of Mailbox to the world’s most popular mobile platform. […]
* Mailbox for Mac has been another labor of love for our team. It’s the product of painstaking iteration (over, and over, and over) to build the lightest, fastest, most delightful desktop mail client ever. You can watch a demo of the app during the Dropbox keynote (available on theDropbox blog later today), and sign up to get early access here. We’ve still got quite a bit of work to do, but we’ll be adding people to the beta as quickly as we can.

* Additionally, Mailbox announced the introduction of a new feature called Auto-swipe. This will learn from your swipes and snoozes to automate many of your actions like Snooze, Mute, and message filtering. And it’ll use Dropbox to sync Auto-swipe data across your devices.
* If you haven’t checked it out yet, Mailbox is available in the App Store, for both iPhone and iPad, for free.
