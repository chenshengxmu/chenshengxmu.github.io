* As promised, Japanese gaming giant Nintendo today released its first app designed for iOS devices, Miitomo, in the App Store in the United States and elsewhere following a recent soft-launch in the Japanese App Store.
* The free-to-play title lets you customize your Mii avatars by mixing and matching from various costumes and styles. You can share your Miis with friends on social media and discover things that you share in common by engaging in conversations.
* As a bonus, your friends’ Mii character visit you when you play.
* Your existing Miis can be imported from the Wii U or Nintendo 3DS systems using QR Code scanning and there’s a cool feature that takes advantage of your iOS device’s built-in camera to convert your selfies into Mii form.
* Along with the game, a new My Nintendo rewards program launched that lets you earn Platinum Points by interacting with Nintendo apps and services like Miitomo.
* These points can be redeemed for rewards like games, in-app items and eShop discount coupons at Nintendo’s enhanced Wii U and Nintendo 3DS shop on Nintendo.com.
* More than 2,000 games are available on the digital store and all purchases are sent directly to users’ Nintendo 3DS or Wii U systems for download. Those who have signed up for a Nintendo Account before March 31 have received free Platinum Points as a gift.
* Miitomo requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and is localized in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish.
* Grab Miitomo free of charge in the App Store.
