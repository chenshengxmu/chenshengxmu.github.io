* Back in May, Tiny Wings creator Andreas Illiger told reporters that the world could expect a sequel to his popular mobile game “within 3 weeks.” But those 3 weeks came and went, and we haven’t heard a peep.
* Then yesterday, Illiger finally broke the silence by releasing a Tiny Wings 2 teaser trailer. And while the video doesn’t give much information away regarding the game, we have to admit, it’s pretty fun to watch…
* Luckily the clip does give away one important bit of information — the game’s release date. Tiny Wings fans can expect the sequel to land on iOS on July 12th, which happens to be next Thursday.
* As usual, we’ll let you know as soon as the title hits the App Store.
* Now, who’s excited for Tiny Wings 2?
