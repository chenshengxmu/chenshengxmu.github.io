* If you’re one of those people patiently waiting for an unlock for iPhone 4 other than baseband 01.59.00, we’ve got some bad news for you.
* According to a recent tweet from Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd, it is taking longer than expected to get the unlock figured out. With the official release of iOS 4.3 earlier today, the Dev Team most likely encountered new bumps on their road to unlock…
* If you’re still on baseband 01.59.00 though, you can always jailbreak and unlock using UltraSn0w.
* We’ll keep you updated as we learn more about this situation.
