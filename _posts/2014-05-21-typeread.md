* One great feature of iMessage is the ability to send read receipts to people who send you a text from an iOS device, basically letting them now that not only you have received their text, but you’ve actually read it too.
* But what if, from time to time, you do not want the other person to know that you have read their message right away? Of course, you could turn off reader receipts altogether, but if you’re looking for a little more flexibility, have a look at TypeRead…
* Developed by CFK and Sassoty, TypeRead is a tweak that will only send read receipts once you start typing your reply back to the sender. This is the perfect tweak for people who do want to send read receipts but want to make sure those receipts are sent on their terms.
* Let’s imagine your girlfriend sends you a text at 6pm asking you to come home right away, you can read this message and not reply to it until later on. At 9pm, when you’re done playing GTA with your friends, you can reply to the message and tell her you just saw it. She will get a read receipts with a time stamp of 9pm. This is of course a tricky example I am sharing with you, but you get the idea.
* TypeRead is available for $0.99 in the BigBoss repo. If you want to have a little more control over your read receipts, it doesn’t look like a bad tweak to add to your arsenal.
* If you do give it a download, please make sure to come back here and tell us what you think in the comments section.
