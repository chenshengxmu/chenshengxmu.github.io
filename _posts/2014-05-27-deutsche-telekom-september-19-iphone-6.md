* German wireless carrier Deutsche Telekom has apparently instructed its call center representatives to nudge wavering customers toward staying with them.
* Support staff was reportedly told to drop hints that customers’ loyalty could be well rewarded as the company gets to carry the anticipated iPhone 6 in mid-September – more specifically, on September 19.
* That’s the gist of a new report by Apfelpage.de. The date is likely more than an educated guesstimate.
* Remember, Deutsche Telekom is one of the largest carriers in the world and they own T-Mobile. That being said, we’re filing this away into our mental drawer under the ‘Very Likely’ category…
* German-language Apfelpage.de [Google translate] adds that the carrier is even considering to permit those customers whose contract has or is about to expire to register their interest for the upcoming handset, beginning July.
* Keep in mind that it doesn’t take a genius to figure out a likely timeframe of the iPhone 6’s debut: a mid-September launch would be consistent with the iPhone 4s/5/5s/5c which were all introduced in September.
* September 19 is a very specific date and even though Apple most definitely would not share the official release date for such a massively hyped product with a carrier nearly four months in advance, leaks do happen and are a fact of life in this industry.
* Bonn, Germany-based Deutsche Telekom in a similar vein last year hinted that the the iPhone 5s would support LTE Advanced. And in early-September 2012, the carrier even started taking pre-orders for the iPhone 5 which at that point had not been officially announced.
* Yes, September 19 is a Friday.
