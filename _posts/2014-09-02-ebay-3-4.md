* eBay, an e-commerce website, has a nice iPhone and iPad app which has just gotten a whole lot more useful. Now available as an iOS 7.0-only download from the App Store, the new eBay version 3.4 offers a plethora of new features, refinements and improvements that advance the experience.
* For starters, the software now delivers important alerts inside itself when using the app.
* Moreover, the eBay Now feature for finding and buying products from local stores is now integrated and you can check a buyer’s location when reviewing a Best Offer. You can also explore bonus offers from eBay sellers, donate a percentage of your sales toward charity purposes and more.
* You’ll also notice a slightly revamped layout with larger photos and the addition of reviews for all products. Although the previous version did contain product reviews, many items in the eBay catalog did not present them inside the app.
* Last but not least, eBay 3.4 now lets you send a payment reminder within the app while people with disabilities will appreciate several accessibility improvements.
* eBay 3.4 for iOS changelog:
* The mobile app received a thorough makeover back in April with a brand new Home page with Watched items, Feed and eBay Deals and such perks as photos in messages, support for selling in Austria and The Netherlands, integration with Apple’s Passbook for in-store pick up order details and more.
* While we’re at it, eBay in the summer of last year released an app called eBay Exact which allows iPhone owners to customize and purchase 3D-printed merchandise from the palm of their hand.
* If you’re a fan of the Pebble, eBay also has an app for the smartwatch available.
* The 50.6-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad compatible with iOS 7.0 or later. Actually, this is the first release of the mobile eBay app that no longer works on pre-iOS 7 editions.
