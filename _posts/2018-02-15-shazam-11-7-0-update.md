* Shazam for iOS received an update today, bringing the app to version 11.7.0. The update brings about a handful of new features and improvements, including a refreshed interface and real-time Lyric Syncing.
* Here’s the full change log:
* Your Shazams have a new look!
* Once you’ve named that tune, you’ll see a brand-new song page with the following features:
* – Lyric Syncing: Belt it like you wrote it! With our new lyric-syncing, you’ll see a song’s lyrics in real time, enabling you to not just sing along to any song you Shazamed but finally master those words.
* – Streamlined Results: Now when you Shazam a song, you’ll get the results and one big photo of the artist behind it—perfect for focusing on the music you were looking to discover in the first place. For more info, simply tap on the artist photo.
* – Everything In Its Right Place: We’re excited to introduce an all-new track-result menu that makes it easy to view song lyrics, artist videos, updates and more in a single tap. Or swipe.
* – Faster Playlisting: Connected to Apple Music or Spotify? ‘Add to’ playlist now takes one less tap. Simple!
* As you may recall, Apple is currently in the process of acquiring Shazam for around $400 million. There has been some concerns that Apple plans to shutdown the service and integrate it into Apple Music, but its steady updates of the standalone app suggest otherwise.
* Shazam is available in the App Store for free.
