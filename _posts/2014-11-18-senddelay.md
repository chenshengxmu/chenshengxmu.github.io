* It’s happened to me several times before to send a message and quickly realize I was actually sending it to the wrong person. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same situation at some point. If you wish there was a way to stop a message from getting delivered, you should probably check out a brand new jailbreak tweak known as SendDelay.
* Just as obvious as its name sounds, SendDelay is a solid tweak that delays your message before it is delivered to your friend. After you press the send button in the Messages app, it will be replaced with a red ‘Stop’ button that gives you a change to stop the message from getting sent. After the delay time ends, the message will be sent automatically to the recipient.
* If you find yourself sending messages to the wrong person frequently, you’ll no longer need to worry about it if you start using SendDelay. With that said, the tweak works with the stock Messages app only and not any other app such as Whatsapp, Viber etc.

* Once you install it, a new preference pane will be added to the stock Settings app dedicated to SendDelay. There you’ll find a slider that allows you to adjust the delay time ranging from zero to five seconds. Once you’ve chosen an appropriate duration, you’re good to go.
* Although the tweak will come in handy, it can get quite annoying if you’re sending multiple messages at once to your friend and have to wait each time for the delay duration to end. This is one of the major drawbacks of the tweak that will put you off, but the developer could provide an option to send the message right away or to stop it after you’ve tapped on the Send button.
* Yet, if you wish to give this tweak a try, head to Cydia and install it for free from the BigBoss repo. What do you think of SendDelay? Have you ever sent a message to the wrong person accidentally? Let us know in the comments section below.
