* Apple on Tuesday debuted international versions of its Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Previously you could only purchase the accessory with a United States English layout, but now you can get it in British English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and several other languages.
* For many, a keyboard remains a convenient way to put thoughts down and get work done. The Smart Keyboard — available for both the 9.7‑inch and 12.9‑inch iPad Pro — features innovative technologies that free you from switches, plugs, and even pairing. It’s a perfect blend of utility and portability.
* The new keyboards come as Apple ramps up its messaging for the iPad Pro, releasing a new commercial earlier this week that positions the tablet as a total computer replacement. You can buy international versions of the Smart Keyboard on their respective countries’ Apple websites.
