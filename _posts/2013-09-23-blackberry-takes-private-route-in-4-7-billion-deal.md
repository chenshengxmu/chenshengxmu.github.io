* Canadian phone maker BlackBerry – once the undisputed enterprise giant that used to be synonymous with smartphones and whose iconic BlackBerry handsets with their clickety-clack keyboards and real-time, secure push email were considered the real work machines – is now entertaining a $4.7 billion offer from its largest shareholder, a move that would take the free-falling phone company private.
* Fairfax Financial Holdings, which already owns 9.9 percent of the Waterloo, Ontario firm, would pay $9 per share, a 3.1 percent premium over last week’s share price. According to a statement by Fairfax CEO Prem Watsa, the private company will “focus on delivering superior and secure enterprise solutions to BlackBerry customers around the world.”…
* The buyout offer announced  today is just the latest chapter for BlackBerry, which discounted the iPhone when the Apple handset first appeared, then found itself unable to compete in a market dominated by Google’s Android handsets and Apple’s iOS-based iPhone and iPad devices.
* After falling from CrackBerry to just cracked, the company last week cut 4,500 jobs and a announced a $960 million write-down on unsold Z10 BlackBerry smartphones. The handsets, which CEO Thorsten Heins hoped would breathe life into the firm, never caught fire with the buying public.

* The move by Fairfax was telegraphed somewhat when Watsa resigned from the BlackBerry board in August as the company publicly put out the ‘For Sale’ sign.
* Asked about what he thought of the current mobile landscape – especially concerning Nokia’s sale to Microsoft and RIM woes – Apple CEO Tim Cook told Bloomberg Businesweek that Nokia “is a reminder to everyone in business that you have to keep innovating and that to not innovate is to die”.
* Here’s ex-CEO Mike Lazaridis knee-jerk reaction to a BBC Click interview and hard talk concerning its platform’s security in certain countries and comparison to Apple’s devices (the fun part starts at mark 5:45, just before he becomes nervous and abruptly ends the interview).
* AlthoughFairfax is currently the only bidder, there is a period of “due diligence” lasting until November 4. During that period, Fairfax can look at BlackBerry’s books and the smartphone maker could entertain competing bids.
* Perhaps looking to make the bitter pill easier to swallow, BlackBerry also today unveiled its new phablet, the BlackBerry Z30 smartphone, that has a five-inch screen, runs BlackBerry 10.2 OS and sports “the largest battery yet on a BlackBerry smartphone”, check it out in a promo video below.

* In the end, taking BlackBerry private seems the only way for the company to stem the tide of red ink, at least prevent the death by a thousand press releases detailing further losses.
* Like the smartphone industry, which is essentially a duopoly controlled by Android and iOS, PC maker Dell found itself forced to go private as computer sales fell off a cliff.
