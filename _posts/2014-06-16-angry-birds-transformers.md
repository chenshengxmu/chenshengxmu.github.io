* I can’t stand any more of Angry Birds. There, I’ve said it. Still, a lot of fans feel the series hasn’t run its course yet so this one should be fun: Finland-based Angry Birds maker Rovio Mobile has now partnered with Hasbro on a new tie-in game. They’re calling it Angry Birds Transformers and it’s coming real soon to an iOS device near you.
* Jump past the fold for full details…
* The Finnish developer said Monday that Angry Birds Transformers won’t be just a game: they’re planning on swarming the market with various consumer licensed goods and a new product line from Hasbro.
* Not only does the game feature a new story and characters, it also supports Hasbro’s Telepods brand-engaging platform.
* Can you say Autobirds and Deceptihogs?
* Later this year Hasbro will introduce a product line featuring Telepods technology which will enable fans to teleport their favorite Angry Birds Transformers characters into the game and gain unique powers. 
* This isn’t the first time Rovio partnered with Hasbro.
* Earlier this year, Rovio’s Angry Birds Go kart-racing game released as a product born out of the Rovio-Hasbo partnership. And last year, the two companies created and marketed the Angry Birds Star Wars mashup of mobile games and merchandize.
* To keep tabs on future developments concerning Angry Birds Transformers, bookmark the official game website.
* Rovio has seen remarkable successes with the omnipresent Angry Birds series.
* The universe of Angry Birds-themed products now spans interactive games, animated series, plush toys and what not. In addition to Angry Birds Transformers, Rovio last week released a new spinoff game called Angry Birds Epic.
* As featured by iDownloadBlog’s App Recap column, the subtly humorous and free-to-download game includes epic battles between your favorite pig characters Red, Chuck and Bomb and classic evil pig villains like King Pig, Wiz Pig and Prince Porky.
