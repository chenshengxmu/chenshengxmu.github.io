* Nintendo on Wednesday announced that its next game released for mobile will be a new entry from the popular Fire Emblem franchise. It’s called Fire Emblem Heroes, and it is slated to launch on iOS and Android on February 2.
* Like other FE titles, Heroes is a tactical roleplaying game with upgradeable characters from the series. In this all-new storyline, players are tasked with summoning warriors to fight in epic battles between two warring kingdoms.
* As you can see in the trailer, Heroes will feature turn-based gameplay, fought over a smaller 8×6 battle grid designed for smartphones. The game controls consist of swiping and tapping, allowing for simple, one-handed gameplay.
* Similar to its strategy in Super Mario Run, Nintendo says Fire Emblem Heroes will be free-to-play, with some in-app purchases. It’s taken a bit of criticism over that pricing, however, so it’ll be interesting to see if anything changes.
