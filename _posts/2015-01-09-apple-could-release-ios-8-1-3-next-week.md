* BGR is out with a report today claiming that Apple could be releasing a software update as soon as next week. It is unclear whether it would be a beta release, or the public release of iOS 8.1.3, but the publication notes the software could be available Tuesday or Wednesday.
* iDB’s own analytics showed a very clear spike of traffic yesterday emanating from devices running iOS 8.1.3 on Apple’s networks, which could indicate that the public version of iOS 8.1.3 is right around the corner and currently being seeded to select Apple employees.
* If that was the case, iOS 8.1.3 would likely come with a handful of bug fixes rather than new features, which are expected to be released along iOS 8.2.
* iOS 8.2 beta 3 was seeded to developers on December 18. It was recently reported that Apple could be expanding iOS beta testing to include retail employees.
