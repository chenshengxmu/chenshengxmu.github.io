* More details are trickling in regarding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 5S revision and a brand new plastic iPhone 5C. An interesting confirmation concerning the devices’s rumored colors has come to light Monday, independently via both a new batch of photographs that purportedly depict the iPhone 5S chassis and a post on the popular Chinese micro-blogging site.
* Not only will the iPhone 5S be allegedly provided in the controversial new gold/champagne variant, but also in the stylish graphite finish – a first for the iPhone. As for the iPhone 5C, expect that device to be offered in at least four different colors, among them a deep greenish blue color…
* According to a picture an unnamed source posted to Pingguohui, Sina.com’s news channel dedicated to Apple, the entry-level iPhone 5C will come in four polycarbonate plastic chassis variants: green, blue, white and pink.
* These images are in line with a June report by the Japanese blog Macotakara which first asserted the iPhone 5C should borrow the color palette of the iPhone 4 bumpers, including a bright orange variant.
* As for the the iPhone 5S, that device should be available in two editions, black and gold/black, the poster wrote. Indeed, blogger Sonny Dickson has already shared on his blog a set of photos depicting this new graphite iPhone 5S flavor, pictured in this post.

* He claims to have seen the iPhone 5S shells in four colors thus far: gold, slate, white with silver trim and now “a grey or graphite color with a black trim”. Sonny’s post contains at least a dozen additional high-quality images so check it out for more awesomeness.
* Another piece of evidence: a pic by repair shop Mendmyi that apparently shows the iPhone 5S’s graphite/champagne volume/mute buttons next to their slate and silver counterparts from the iPhone 5.

* Perhaps surprisingly enough, the repair shop claims that Apple may be planning to offer the iPhone 5S only in two basic color options: the gold/champagne and black/graphite.
* Remember, Apple currently offers the iPhone 5 in just two variants: the white/silver and black/slate combos. If the rumors are true, Apple should formally announce the iPhone 5S/5C at an upcoming September 10 media event, though the company has yet to send out invites.
* So, do you like the graphite iPhone 5S look?
* It reminds you a bit of the original iPhone, no?
