* PowerSaver is a new jailbreak tweak, which lends your iPhone the ability to execute specific actions based on the amount of battery power you have remaining.
* For instance, when you reach 50% power, you can have the iPhone dim the brightness, skip to the next music track, or lock the screen.
* Have a look inside, for a full video synopsis of PowerSaverâ€¦
* In all, you can program up to 14 different actions using PowerSaver, so you can really get specific when it comes to executing actions at certain battery intervals.
* I did notice that not all of the functions executed at the exact battery level that I indicated, and that some commands, like Safe Mode, were best left alone, due to the fact that it caused an infinite respring loop.
* Fortunately, most of those issue have been ironed out with the 1.01 update, but I have to be honest and say that the tweak can still be quite finicky at times.
* If you want to try out PowerSaver for yourself, head over to the BigBoss repo on Cydia, where you can purchase it for $1.50.
* Do you think something like this would be helpful to your day-to-day iPhone routine, or more of an inconvenience? Let me know what you think in the comments below.
