* National Geographic Society produces some of the most compelling, fact-checked content money can buy and their World Atlas iPad app has long been my go-to reference source, not just for checking out interesting facts and trivia but for doing serious research related to the world’s countries, their economies, demographics and so forth.
* They updated the app on January 11 with high-resolution Retina graphics, revamped UI and added a new feature which lets you explore a full 3D view of the globe.
* Today, they’re making the app free for a limited time and you’re advised to download it now before the price goes up. Note that this is the first time ever the app has become available as a free download since its 2010 App Store debut…
* One of the new features in National Geographic World Atlas version 3.0.1 is the ability to download maps for offline use. Besides, all the maps have been updated for high-def appearance, with some nice infographics that livens up each country’s Flags and Facts section (these include various pieces of information, like socio-economic data, demographics, weather and currency).
* New features include:
* • Store your pins in the cloud and share them across devices. Plan a trip on your iPad, then use your customized map on your iPhone. • Add and customize collections of map pins • Get up-to-the-minute weather • Check the latest currency conversion rates, or use the currency calculator to convert from one currency to another • See latitude and longitude indications directly, with a tap of your finger.

* You can explore the world in classic, antique, satellite or road map style. Maps are provided by Bing maps.
