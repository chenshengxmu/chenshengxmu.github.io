* Google on Monday announced that it’s merging its two payment platforms, Android Pay and Google Wallet, into a single service branded as “Google Pay.”
* As a result, Android Pay branding will be retired.
* “Today, we’re excited to announce we’ll be bringing together all the different ways to pay with Google, including Android Pay and Google Wallet, into a single brand: Google Pay,” it said.
* The simplification of its mobile payments offerings will make it easier for customers to pay for stuff by looking for the “Google Pay” logo at checkout in Google apps, online and in stores.
* Taking advantage of the payment information saved to your Google Account, Google Pay makes it easy to speed through the checkout process with peace of mind (it’s already available on Airbnb, Dice, Fandango, HungryHouse, Instacart and other select apps and websites).
* “Over the coming weeks, you’ll see Google Pay online, in store and across Google products, as well as when you’re paying friends,” said the company.
* Google has promised to bring these new experiences to Tez users in India as well.
