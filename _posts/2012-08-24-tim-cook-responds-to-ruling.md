* Late this afternoon, the jury handed down a verdict in the US-based Apple vs Samsung trial. Samsung was found guilty of willfully infringing on several of Apple’s patents, and will be forced to pay major damages.
* Both companies have since released statements on the ruling. Apple, of course, is thrilled with the outcome, while Samsung says that it’s a loss for the American consumer. And now, here’s Tim Cook’s response…
* 9to5Mac has an internal email sent from Cook to Apple corporate employees:
* “Today was an important day for Apple and for innovators everywhere.
* Many of you have been closely following the trial against Samsung in San Jose for the past few weeks. We chose legal action very reluctantly and only after repeatedly asking Samsung to stop copying our work. For us this lawsuit has always been about something much more important than patents or money. It’s about values. We value originality and innovation and pour our lives into making the best products on earth. And we do this to delight our customers, not for competitors to flagrantly copy.
* We owe a debt of gratitude to the jury who invested their time in listening to our story. We were thrilled to finally have the opportunity to tell it. The mountain of evidence presented during the trial showed that Samsung’s copying went far deeper than we knew.
* The jury has now spoken. We applaud them for finding Samsung’s behavior willful and for sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn’t right.
* I am very proud of the work that each of you do.
* Today, values have won and I hope the whole world listens.
* Tim”
* It’s been a pretty big day for Cook, who is also celebrating his one-year anniversary as Apple’s CEO. No doubt, being able to put this behind him, whether Samsung appeals or not, is a huge weight off his shoulders.
* What do you think of Tim’s response?
