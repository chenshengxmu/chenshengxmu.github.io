* Heads-up deal seekers. Apple has named Tiny Hearts Limited’s “Wake Alarm Clock” its App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the popular alarm clock app for free for both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $4.
* For those unfamiliar with the app, Wake is highly regarded for its beautiful and intuitive design, and its range of various alarm modes. You can slap your phone to activate a short snooze, flip it to turn off all alarms, or you can set it so you have to shake your phone to turn all alarms off.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Need a boost to get out of bed in the morning? Wake’s gesture-based alarms deliver wake-up calls you won’t ignore, letting you slap, flip, and shake your iPhone or iPad to hit the snooze button or turn off alerts. With a variety of alarm sounds to choose from—even your favorite songs—plus a streamlined interface that’s a pleasure to use, it’s a refreshing start to your day.
* And here’s a clip that shows the app in action:
* If you’re interested, you can find Wake Alarm Clock in the App Store for free. Note that there are several in-app purchases available, but they are just for additional alarm packs.
