* TinyUmbrella, the tool that allows you to save your SHSH blobs to let you downgrade your iDevice firmware to an older version, has been updated to bring support for iOS 5.0.1.
* As we had previously reported, there is currently no way to downgrade an iPhone 4S due to the way Apple now signs your firmware during the restore process (more info about that here)…
* Even though there is still no working solution for restoring 5.x on iPhone 4S I have released a 5.01.00 so you can at least save 5.0.1 SHSH. I have added tentative support for at least saving 5.0.1 SHSHs for iPhone 4S but as of now we are unable to use them fully.
* It’s still a good thing to save your SHSH blobs, even if you are on an iPhone 4S. You never know what the future might hold and you’d better be safe than sorry.
* You can download the latest version of TinyUmbrella from our downloads section.
