* The new iPhone 8/Plus will be the first iPhone to include wireless charing. Utilizing the Qi wireless charging standard, you will soon be able to charge your iPhone 8 in many places just by setting it down.
* Many were worried that Apple would introduce a proprietary charging solution for the new iPhone, but Apple pleasantly surprised many by adopting the open standard, Qi. That means many charing pads that work on Android phones will also work with the new iPhone.
