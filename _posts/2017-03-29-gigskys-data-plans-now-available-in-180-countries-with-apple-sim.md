* GigSky is now offering its data plans in over 180 countries on Apple SIM, plus great new pricing, the company announced Tuesday. GigSky in the summer of 2016 expanded its service to more than 140 countries worldwide, meaning their affordable mobile data plans for iPad users with Apple SIM are now available in about 40 new markets versus last summer.
* Some of the new additions to GigSky’s service on Apple SIM include Argentina, The Bahamas, Belize, Bhutan, Colombia, French Polynesia, Guam, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco and Nepal.
* Here’s the full list of newly added markets where GigSky is available as of today:
* The company now covers more countries than any other mobile operator on Apple SIM.
* With Apple SIM, you just select a GigSky data plan within Settings on your iPad, no paperwork needed whatsoever. The service is separately available on other iOS devices via the GigSky SIM and app.

We’re so pleased to have taken another step in addressing the needs of our customers, while continuing to offer real convenience and global connectivity. We set our sights on offering service in every single country– we’re almost there,” said Ravi Rishy-Maharaj, GigSky Founder and CEO.
* Apple SIM is compatible with the newly announced 9.7-inch iPad, as well as iPad Pro, iPad mini 4, iPad mini 3 and iPad Air 2. Apple’s cellular-outfitted iPad Pro (9.7-inch) ships with a built-in Apple SIM. Other cellular iPad models may ship with Apple SIM in some countries. Apple SIM is also available at select Apple Stores.
