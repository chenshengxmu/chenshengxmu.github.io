title: Gesturizer- Launch Apps and Actions Using Gestures

* Is your selection of Activator gestures wearing a little thin? Looking to add an infinite amount of app-launching gestures to your jailbroken iPhone?
* If that sounds all too familiar, then Gesturizer could be just what you need. This jailbreak tweak allows you to launch apps and perform actions, using custom hand-drawn gestures. Check out our full video demonstration inside…
* Once installed, Gesturizer places a new settings panel in your Settings app. Within, you will find two sample gesture profiles, and an option to add additional gestures.
* Gestures, or glyphs as they’re called in Gesturizer, can consist of any hand-drawn symbol or character.
* Once you have your glyph established for your particular gesture, simply perform the gesture on the top half of the App Switcher window; doing so immediately launches the Activator action or URL that you configured in the settings panel.
* At $2.99, Gesturizer isn’t cheap, but if you’re a heavy Activator user, and you’re running low on options, it may be the solution for you.
* Gesturizer can be downloaded from Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and it’s compatible with both the iPhone and the iPad.
* Have you taken it for a spin? If so, how’d you like it?
