* As promised, Google’s machine learning and artificial intelligence-powered visual search feature, called Lens, is now rolling out on iOS via the search giant’s free Google Photos app.
* Lens is a staggered release so iOS customers can expect to see it in their Google Photos app over the next week. With Lens, the Photos app is able to analyze what’s on your photos and offer quick actions to help you discover more about the world around you.
* Before you get started with Lens, be sure that your device language is set to English. Next, open the Google Photos app, select any photo, then tap the Google Lens icon to learn more about landmarks, see ratings, hours, historical facts and more.
* If you don’t see the Lens icon, that’s because the feature is now available yet in your country so give it a few days before trying again.
* Starting today and rolling out over the next week, those of you on iOS can try the preview of Google Lens to quickly take action from a photo or discover more about the world around you. Make sure you have the latest version (3.15) of the app.https://t.co/Ni6MwEh1bu pic.twitter.com/UyIkwAP3i9
