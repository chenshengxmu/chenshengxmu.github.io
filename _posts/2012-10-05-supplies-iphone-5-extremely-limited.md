title: Supplies of iPhone 5 is extremely limited amid unprecedented demand
---
* Remember the cliffhanger scene in movies: a damsel in distress is tied to railroad tracks ahead of an oncoming train. Will the hero arrive in time to rescue her? That’s a bit like the situation we have with the iPhone 5.

* Analysts are trimming their sales forecast of Apple’s new handset due to ‘extremely limited’ supplies and the all-important holiday buying period is bearing down. Can suppliers rescue Apple? Can Apple meet unprecedented demand in time to take advantage of everyone wanting an iPhone 5 in their stocking?
* Thursday, high-profile Apple analyst Gene Munster shaved 2 million iPhone 5 from his September sales forecast, estimating Apple will sell 25 million iPhones instead of 27.2 million. The Piper Jaffray analyst pointed to a supply of iPhone 5 that is “extremely limited.” However, Munster figures investors will be rewarded in the December quarter, sticking with his estimate of 49 million iPhones sold.
* It is ironic how supplies may be at the heart of this iPhone 5 sales glitch given Apple’s almost obsessively-tight management of its supply chain. However, the Cupertino, Calif. company threw suppliers a curve by introducing a new technology requirement: in-cell displays that melds touch sensors with the screen. But one analyst points to a vast number of mobile subscribers set free from their contracts and migrating en mass to the iPhone.
* Some 170 million post paid subscribers have reached the end of their contract, Jeffries analyst Peter Misek told AllThingsD.
* “That’s overwhelming all supply ramps. The demand here is unprecedented,” he said. But if Apple can get control of its supply problem and get an iPhone 5 into the hands of everyone who wants one, the December quarter could be the mother of all blow-outs.
* What do you think? Can Apple overcome the limited supplies? What lesson was learned from the iPhone 5 supply horror stories?
