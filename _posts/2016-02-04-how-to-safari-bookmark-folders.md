* In Safari, you can save websites you visit frequently so you can quickly revisit them later without having to remember their URLs. Saved webpages are accessible in Safari’s Bookmarks menu on the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac.
* If you save a lot of bookmarks, they will clutter the Bookmarks menu over time so locating that favorite website of yours will begin to feel like finding a needle in the haystack. You can avoid this by creating themed folders for organizing your bookmarks.
* This tutorial provides step by step instructions for creating new Safari bookmark folders for iOS and macOS. You will also learn how to rename, reposition and delete these folders and file websites into them, all of which will help you organize your favorite websites to your liking.
* Step 1: Launch Safari on your iOS device and tap the Bookmarks icon.
* Step 2: Tap Edit.
* Step 3: Tap New Folder.
* Step 4: You’ll be taken to the folder creation screen. In the Title field, name the folder. Tap the field below the Location heading to nest the newly created folder inside one of the existing bookmark folders.

* NOTE: Apple’s iCloud web interface at iCloud.com currently lacks support for managing bookmarks and folders.
* And last but not least, Safari for Mac has a nice little shortcut for quickly creating a folder which contains some of your previously saved bookmarks. First invoke the Bookmarks Editor: click Edit at the bottom of the sidebar, or choose Edit Bookmarks in Safari’s Bookmarks menu or hit Option (⌥) – Command (⌘) – B.
* Now select one or more bookmarks in the sidebar by holding either the Shift or Command (⌘) key when clicking the items, and then hold the Option (⌥) key as you click the New Folder button.
* This will instantly create a folder and move the selected bookmarks into it.

* I suggest keeping your bookmarks, browsing history, Reading List and other Safari data in perfect sync across all your devices by enabling Safari in Settings → iCloud on your iOS devices and in System Preferences → iCloud on Macs you own.
* As an added bonus, the iCloud.com web interface lets you restore Safari bookmarks and Reading List from an earlier version that was automatically archived in iCloud.
