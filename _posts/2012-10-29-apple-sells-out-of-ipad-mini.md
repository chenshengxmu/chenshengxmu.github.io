* Apple has taken some heavy criticism over the past few days regarding the iPad mini’s price tag. Starting at $329, a lot of folks feel that it has priced itself out of the 7-8-inch tablet market, which is dominated by $200 slates.
* Well if that’s the case, then someone forgot to tell consumers. Because according to Apple’s website, the company has sold out of its initial pre-order stock of all Wi-Fi iPad minis during the tablet’s first 72 hours of availability…
* The iPad mini, alongside the new 4th gen iPad went on sale at 12:01 am on Friday morning. And within an hour, all white models were completely sold out. Then yesterday, the 16GB version of the black models also disappeared.
* Finally last night, we noticed that 32GB and 64GB black iPad mini models were showing an estimated shipping time of two weeks as well, essentially meaning that Apple had sold out of its allotted pre-order stock for the tablet.
* This is good news for the Cupertino company, as the iPad mini is a new product with zero track record. It’ll be interesting to find out how many of them it actually sold this weekend; hopefully we’ll see those numbers later today.
* If you’re still looking to snag an iPad mini, don’t worry. Apple Stores will still be carrying the tablets on November 2nd when the it officially launches. And + Cellular models will become available later this month.
