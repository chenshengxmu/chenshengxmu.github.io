* Don’t you wish you could avoid the usual routine after taking photos with your iPhone: sifting through shots to eliminate the ones where your thumb is perfectly exposed – but your special someone is blurred beyond recognition. Your worries may be over, as a new patent reveals Apple wants to make you a better camera phone photographer. The camera Apple outlined in the filing is designed to continuously capture and store images in a buffer until you release the shutter.
* Your mobile device takes from there to automatically scan the buffer, rate the pictures just taken using a number of parameters and present you with the best image…
* Apple’s patent for an “Image Capturing Device Having Continuous Image Capture”, filed with the USPTO in October 2012, compensates for a smartphone’s lack of high-quality optics and powerful image sensors found in digital cameras, according to AppleInsider.
* To prevent the usual delay digital photographers experience when the camera switches from preview mode to the full image, the iPhone just presents the preview image.
* That image is often pixelated and blurry.
* To avoid this, Apple’s patent buffers the images take, quickly scores them, and then presents one full-resolution image meeting the specifications.

* From Apple’s filing:
* These image capturing devices typically use a preview resolution for capturing a preview image of a scene. Subsequently, a user provides an input to take a photograph. The device switches from preview resolution to full resolution prior to capturing an image.
* Switching from preview to full resolution causes a time lag, which may lead to user frustration. Also, camera shake during the time when a user presses a button or touches a touchscreen can degrade image quality.
* Hopefully, this new technology will make its way into the iPad, which lags behind the iPhone in quality photo capability.
* As for the iPhone, in the right hands, the smartphone can become the favorite device for photos. In a 2011, interview, famed celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz singled out the iPhone 4S as the modern snapshot camera.
