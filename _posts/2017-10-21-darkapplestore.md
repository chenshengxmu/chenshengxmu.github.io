* Jailbreakers that use the Apple Store app to browse Apple’s product offerings can take advantage of a new free jailbreak tweak called DarkAppleStore by iOS developer CydiaGeek to spice up its user interface.
* Post-installation, DarkAppleStore applies a darkened blur to the translucent tab bar at the bottom of the app, causing it to resemble the before and after images you see above and below.

* It’s a polarizing shift from the norm, but considering I’m already partial to the Dark Mode feature available in macOS, I happen to admire these kinds of darkened interfaces.
* Right off the bat, I like how the tweak doesn’t merely make the tab bar dark in color; it maintains the stock translucency effect so you can discern vague features from the app’s interface behind the tab bar when scrolling up or down. That said, you get a distinct experience with DarkAppleStore that you wouldn’t get from tweaks like Eclipse.
* When it comes to cosmetic tweaks like DarkAppleStore, everything comes down to opinion. Some people like their interfaces lighter, while others like them darker; personally, I don’t mind when things look more dismal, but your mileage may vary.
* DarkAppleStore is compatible with all jailbroken iOS 10 devices and works only with the Apple Store app, which is a free download from the App Store if you’re not already using it.
* If you’re interested in trying DarkAppleStore, you can download the tweak for free from Cydia. It’s not available in any public repositories, so you’ll have to follow these steps to get it:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you should be able to find and install DarkAppleStore by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
