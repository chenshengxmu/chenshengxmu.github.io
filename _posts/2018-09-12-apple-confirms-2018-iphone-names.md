* The official names for this year’s iPhones have been leaked by the best source around, Apple. Earlier today, Sept. 12, the company temporarily updated its product sitemap file, inadvertently giving the product names away. As long rumored, this year’s iPhones will be classed the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, and iPhone Xr.
* First discovered by ATH,  the sitemap file, which Apple quickly pulled, also included links to new silicone and leather cases. The company’s official silicone cases for the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max should come in midnight blue, white, black, stone, and (Product)RED, while the leather cases will be available in saddle brown, taupe, black, and (Product)RED.
* Leather folio cases are also listed in black, (Product)RED, green, Cape Cod blue, and peony pink.
* There hasn’t yet been a leak concerning iPhone Xr cases.

Days later, the site said the 6.5-inch OLED model would be called the iPhone Xs Max. On Sept. 5, 9to5Mac’s Seth Weintraub was the first to use the name iPhone Xr for this year’s 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.
* Also today, ATH leaked new information on this year’s Apple Watch.
