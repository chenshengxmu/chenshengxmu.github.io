* So long MobileMe, it wasn’t nice knowing ya.
* You were overpriced, you didn’t do much, and there were many other cloud services that simply did it better. Good riddance.
* If you’re feeling like I’m feeling, then the revelation that Amazon has halted orders of MobileMe sales is music to your ears.
* Speaking of music, the worst kept secret in the industry will likely be replacing MobileMe as an all in one service that does music, document sharing, and more. Yep, I’m talking about iCloud…
* We all knew this would eventually happen, but the moment Apple themeselves stopped sales of MobileMe, it was a telltale sign that the service was going the way of the dodo.
* Apple’s recent purchase of iCloud.com, and now Amazon’s halt of MobileMe sales appear to be the proverbial nails in the coffin for the half-baked service.
* To tell you the truth, I’m not sure how MobileMe survived this long. I don’t know anyone who bought it, do you?
* iCloud, on the other hand, looks to be a real contender. Apple’s been busy building massive data centers, and aligning themselves with music labels to make sure they get it right.
* Are you sad to see MobileMe coming to an end?
