* We’re still a few days away from the holiday weekend, but in an effort to get a head start, several retailers have launched what they are calling “early” or “pre-” Black Friday sales. We’re going to be covering as many of these deals as possible, with a particular focus on quality products and notable discounts. Here are a few we’ve found from Best Buy thus far.
* Dell 23-inch IPS LED Monitor – it’s not hard to find a display for under $100 these days, but mix in a 23-inch LED-backlit panel made by a widely-praised brand like Dell and your search gets a lot tougher. Features include 8m:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 250 cd/m2 brightness, and ultrafast 6ms gray-to-gray response time. The customer rating on Best Buy’s website is 4.6 out of 5 stars, on over 600 reviews. Available for $100 (normal price $180).
* Dell 27-inch S2715H HD Monitor – if you want a little more screen real estate, Best Buy also has a 27-inch Dell display on special right now. It has the same 6ms response time and contrast ratio as the above panel, it’s just bigger with more inputs. Those inputs include HDMI, VGA and 2 USB 2.0 ports. Customer rating is 4.7 stars, on nearly 400 reviews. Available for $190 (normal price $300).
* Up to $225 off iPad mini 4 models – it’s been a long time since Apple update its smaller tablet line, but the iPad mini 4 is still extremely powerful. Features include an 8″ Retina display, A8 processor, 8MP iSight camera, 10 hours of battery life and Touch ID sensor. Discount amount depends on model. Available for as low as $225 (normal price $350).
* UE – BOOM 2 Bluetooth Speaker – this speaker really needs no explanation, but I’ll give you a quick rundown. It’s waterproof, dirt-proof and shockproof, connects up to 100′ away, offers incredible 360-degree sound, can connect to multiple devices and other speakers simultaneously, and has a built-in mic and call/Siri button. Discount amount depends on color. Available for as low as $155 (normal price $200).
* Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home – this is the king of all universal remotes. It features a full-color touch screen, motion sensing and vibration feedback; support for Nest, Alexa, Philips Hue lights and the August Smart Lock; and comes with its own charging station. There’s a downloadable app for mobile devices and of course you get the easy-to-setup Harmony software. Available for $170 (normal price $350).
* Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones – with up to 40 hours of battery life, Beats Solo3 Wireless is your perfect everyday headphone. It also has Fast-Fuel, which gives you 3 hours of playback on just a 5-minute charge, great sound and comfortable fit. This isn’t the best price we’ve seen, but Best Buy is a popular destination for holiday shoppers. Available for $250 (normal price $300).
* Sharp 50-inch LED Smart TV with Roku – there are going to be a lot of sub-$200 TV deals this weekend, but we like this one for a number of reasons. It’s a recognizable brand and model, with a 4.6 rating on bestbuy.com on 750+ reviews; it has a nice 50-inch Sharp display and Roku’s smart platform with over 3,000 streaming channels; and it has 3 HDMI inputs. Available for $280 (normal price $430).
* Sony 65-inch 4K Smart TV with HDR – if you’re looking for something bigger and more 4K-ish, check out this 65-inch ultra HD TV from Sony. Features include Android TV, Google Cast, Voice Search, HDR, Motionflow XR tech, frame dimming tech, and much more. Want to be absolutely blown away by your new TV’s 4K picture and incredible feature set? Get this TV. Available for $1,400 (normal price $1,800).
* 27-inch 5K iMac 8GB RAM 1TB Storage – this is the latest iMac model with a 27-inch 5K display, Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 1TB hard drive. It also has a standalone AMD R9 graphics card and comes with Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Keyboard. This isn’t the best price we’ve seen for this computer, but it’s close and a really solid deal for a retail chain like Best Buy. Available for $1,630 (normal price $1,800).
