* Recently picked up one of Apple’s new smartphones? Well if it’s an iPhone 8, 8 Plus or iPhone X, you should consider picking up a wireless charging pad. This accessory allows you to charge your device by simply setting it down—no need to manually plug in any cables.
* While this tech is new to Apple’ handsets, wireless charging has been around for quite some time, so there are already a ton of products out there that support it. Below we’ve rounded up some of the best wireless charging pads for iPhone with a price tag under $30.
* The Qi standard of wireless charging uses electromagnetic induction to move power from the charger to your phone. Wireless charging accessories have induction coils that create an alternating electromagnetic field, and compatible handsets have a built-in coil that can receive that energy and convert it back into electricity to charge your device’s battery.
* There are a few caveats here. For one wireless charging is typically slower than its wired counterpart, which isn’t a big deal if you typically charge overnight, but it could be if you’re looking for a quick power-up. It’s worth noting too that the iPhone is capped at 5W of power (that bumps up to 7.5W with the iOS 11.2 software update, but early testing suggests the difference is negligible) for wireless charging—disappointing considering many wireless chargers (including those in our roundup) support 10W or more output.
* It’s also common for Qi wireless charging mats and devices to heat up while in charging—though all of the chargers we’ve listed below have built-in safety features to ensure they don’t get too hot. And finally, a lot of manufacturers recommend removing thicker cases from your phone before setting it on the wireless pad. Again this won’t affect most users, but for the few that use bulky, rugged cases, it can be an inconvenience.

* Spigen’s Essential Qi wireless charger supports QC 2.0 and 3.0 standards—up to 1.5x faster charging than regular wireless chargers. It’s also compatible with a wide range of Qi devices and sports a very slim and subtle design. Features include LED indicators, so you know when your device is properly charging, and built-in safety components to keep your device from overheating. It’s also worth noting that the package comes with a 5-foot Micro-USB cable—slightly longer than most of the cables you get with wireless pads. It does not, however, come with a power adapter.
