* iSHSHit, the tool that lets you save, upload and email your SHSH blobs directly from your iPhone, has been updated to bring support for iOS 4.3.4 and iOS 4.2.9.
* The purpose of iSHSHit is the same as TinyUmbrella, except that it doesn’t require to be connected to a computer in order to save your SHSH blobs. Simply launch the application, select what SHSH blobs you want to backup, and iSHSHit will do the job for you…
* Not only it will save a copy locally on your device, but it will also make sure to send it to Saurik’s server. Additionally, you can email those blobs to yourself.
* For more information about iSHSHit, I suggest you have a look at the review we did of it a few months ago.
* The app is free in Cydia. It is without a doubt one of the best solutions to backup your blobs, especially if you’re on the go.
