* It started as a Kickstarter project and it received enough interest and funding to turn into a reality. The Kogeto Dot is a nifty little peripheral for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S that allows you to shoot 360 degree panoramic video.
* It’s the perfect accessory for recording sporting activities and pretty much anything that involves action. Take a gander at our hands-on video review of the Kogeto Dot…
* In a nutshell, the Kogeto Dot is a wonderful peripheral if you find yourself participating in sports like snowboarding, skateboarding, and the like. It won’t make a mundane activities any more compelling, but it’s a must-try for documenting action moments.
* The video quality suffers due to the fact that it must be “dewarped” and accommodates for 360 degrees of motion, but Kogeto’s target audience likely won’t be bothered by the lack of HD quality video.
* Kogeto provides users with a free Kogeto Looker app that’s downloadable from the App Store to go along with your purchase. The app is require to view and shoot 360 degree panoramic video. It’s not the most exciting app in the world from a design perspective, but it’s functional enough to get the job done.
* The bottom line is this: If your life is exciting enough that your daily activities are worthy of being documented on camera, why not do so in 360 degrees? Otherwise, if you don’t have many action moments in your life, I don’t see you getting much return from the $79.99 asking price.
