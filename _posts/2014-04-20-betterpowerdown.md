* BetterPowerDown is a brand-new jailbreak tweak that allows you to add additional power-off options to iOS 7.0.x. The tweak, which is available for download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99, allows you to add the iOS 7.1 and iOS 6.x power-down sliders to your device.
* We’ve taken BetterPowerDown for a spin on video. Check out our review after the break.
* With iOS 7.1, Apple switched up the style of its interface a bit and incorporated circle-styled slider knobs. BetterPowerDown allows jailbroken iOS 7.0.x users to experience the new style of knob without upgrading and thus losing the precious jailbreak.
* If you’re feeling a bit nostalgic, users have the option of integrating the iOS 6.x power-down sliders as well. Each setting can be adjusted in BetterPowerDown’s preferences with no respring necessary.

* As an added bonus, BetterPowerDown incorporates Hashbang Productions’ RePower tweak. That tweak, which we reviewed a while back, allows you to add slide to respring, and slide to reboot sliders to the power-down screen. Users wishing to enable RePower can do so via a toggle from BetterPowerDown’s preference panel.
* I’ve used BetterPowerDown and I recommend that you try it. It’s a solid way to add iOS 7.1 slider knobs along with additional power-down options to your jailbroken iPhone. If you decide to try it, let me know what you think about it down below in the comments.
