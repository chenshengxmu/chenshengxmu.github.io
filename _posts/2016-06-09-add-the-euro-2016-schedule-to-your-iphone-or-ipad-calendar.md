* The UEFA Euro 2016 will kick off tomorrow with France taking on Romania in the first game of the competition. If you’re a casual football fan (sorry, I can’t call it soccer!), and want to keep up with the competition schedule and fixtures without necessarily downloading a bunch of apps, your best bet is to subscribe to a calendar that will push all games dates, times, and places to your iPhone or iPad calendar app of choice.
* To do so, all you need is to click on this link, and then tap on Subscribe in the popup alert that shows up on the screen.

* Once you’ve done that, you will be able to launch your calendar application on your iPhone and iPad and see the schedule of all games. Note that you can add this calendar to your Mac as well.
* The downside of this method is that you will have to add the calendar to all your devices if you want to see the events on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, for example. However, there is a way to create iCloud calendar subscriptions in order to subscribe once and have the calendar pushed to all your Apple devices via iCloud. Make sure to refer to our tutorial on how to have iCloud sync your calendar subscriptions across Mac, iPhone, and iPad should this be what you’re trying to do.
* The best part is the schedule will be updated as the competition goes on, making sure you always know what team is playing at what day and time.
* The 15th edition of the UEFA European Championship is held in France from June 10 to July 10, 2016. Two-time defending champion Spain, as well as Germany are two teams to keep your eyes on. And France, of course. Allez les bleus!
* As a side note, I’m flying back to France, my home country, on Wednesday, so I will be experiencing the Euro cup right from there. Stoked!
* What teams are you rooting for?
