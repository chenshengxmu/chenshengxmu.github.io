* Apple started raising banners in San Francisco’s Moscone West two days ago, ahead of the big event’s keynote scheduled for next Monday, June 11, at 10am Pacific Time.
* And just this moment, one guy managed to snap a photo outside the Moscone Center which clearly shows the new iOS 6 logo for the first time on one of the banners.
* The photographic evidence confirms that Apple will be showing off iOS 6 so it’s news, not a rumor anymore. The logo is pretty elegant and cool-looking, wouldn’t you agree?
* MacRumors first posted the photo, attributed to Instagram user Zac Altman.
