* Tweetbot users who have been waiting for an updated version of the app for iOS 7 can rejoice, as it has been submitted to Apple for approval.
* In a blog post published yesterday on the company’s website, Tapbots explain they were taken by surprise by iOS 7, and that the app required more than a fresh coat of paint. The upcoming version of Tweetbot for iPhone will be a brand new app that has been reworked from the ground up.
* Although the developers don’t mention anything about pricing in their blog post, it’s safe to assume the new version of Tweetbot for iPhone will be a new app, which means you’ll have to pay full price for it…
* Note that it seems only Tweetbot for iPhone has been submitted for review. According to Tapbots developer Mark Jardine, they haven’t started work on the iPad version yet.
* Seeing the popularity of Tweetbot and Apple’s average 5 day turnaround for app approvals, I wouldn’t be surprised if the app was available in the App Store on Monday.
* Excited?
