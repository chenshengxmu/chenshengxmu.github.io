* AT&T on Tuesday began rolling out support for Wi-Fi calling to some iPhone users running iOS 9 beta 5. The feature was added when that beta was released to developers last week, but testers on the AT&T network are only just now able to activate it.
* For those unfamiliar with Wi-Fi calling, it allows iPhone users to place phone calls over Wi-Fi instead of their cellular network. The feature was first activated for T-Mobile in iOS 8, and users have reported better call quality and improved battery life.
* If you are an AT&T customer, with an iPhone running the latest beta of iOS 9, you can activate Wi-Fi calling by going to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calls. If it’s available, a setup screen will pop up with information and warnings regarding the new feature.
* The rollout appears to be staggered, so if you have AT&T and aren’t seeing it yet, there’s a chance it could come at a later time. AT&T refers to the feature as “in trial,” though, so it’s also possible that it may not work for you until it becomes publicly available.
* iOS 9 is expected to officially launch within the next few months.
