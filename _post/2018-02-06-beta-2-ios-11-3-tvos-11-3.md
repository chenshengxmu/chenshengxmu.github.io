* Apple on Tuesday seeded the second betas of iOS 11.3 and tvOS 11.3 to developers. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air updating mechanism.
* iOS 11.3 is a significant update with AirPlay 2 support, 4 new Animoji, battery health and power management features, ARKit improvements, expanded health record integration, and much more. Check out our hands-on video of the new battery health and performance management features found in iOS 11.3’s Settings → Battery section.

* tvOS 11.3 is a little more tame, focused mainly on bug fixes and security improvements. It does however include Match Content enhancements, automatic frame rate switching on Apple TV 4, automatic mode switching for AirPlay video sessions, and more. Check out our hands-on video with AirPlay 2 on Apple TV.

* We’re still installing today’s updates, and will be sure to report back with any new changes. And as always, if you see something new we’ve missed, be sure to let us know about it in the comments below!
* NOTE: Apple has warned that users installing iOS 11.3 beta 2 via iTunes will need to use iTunes 12.7.3. Apparently they’ve found that Face ID and other features may not work  as expected using older versions of iTunes.
