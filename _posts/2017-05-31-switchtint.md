* I’ve always been a fan of simple customization jailbreak tweaks, and one of the latest releases to catch my eye is one called SwitchTint by iOS developer Justin Petkovic.
* This tweak lets you add a splash of color to all the toggle switches you’ll find throughout iOS, allowing you to add a personal touch to your own device in a subtle way.
* The Settings app will be the most common place you’ll notice the changes, but if you have other apps installed on your device that have their own toggle switches inside them, you’ll notice SwitchTint works in them as well.
* SwitchTint puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure your toggle switch colors:

* Among the things you can colorize are:
* Notably, the colors are chosen via color-picker, so you aren’t limited by preset colors. You can even adjust the transparency of the color:

* The tweak can be toggled on or off on demand with the kill-switch at the top of the preferences pane, and respringing isn’t necessary for saving your changes. You do need to kill affected apps via the App Switcher and re-launch them to save your changes, however.
* SwitchTint is compatible with jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices and is available as a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for those interested in colorizing their devices’ toggle switches.
