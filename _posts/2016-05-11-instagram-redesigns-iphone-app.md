* Facebook-owned Instagram today announced a major new version of its iPhone app with an overhauled user interface with bigger photos and an updated Home screen app icon.
* “Inspired by the previous app icon, the new one represents a simpler camera and the rainbow lives on in gradient form,” explains the company. In addition, they’ve updated app icons for Layout, Boomerang and Hyperlapse, too.
* Instagram is available free of charge on the App Store.
* The design changes in Instagram for iPhone revolve around a new monochromatic look which does provide a flatter appearance. “The simpler app design puts the focus on your posts and keeps your features in the same place,” said Instagram.
* A fresh coat of paint extends to other minor changes, such as an updated Camera button at the bottom and Instagram’s Activity button, which is now a heart icon rather than a heart in a speech bubble.
