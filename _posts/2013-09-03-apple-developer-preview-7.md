* Apple has seeded the seventh developer preview of OS X Mavericks this afternoon. The download comes nearly two weeks after Developer Preview 6 was released, which didn’t carry any significant new features.
* The newest Mavericks preview is now available for download in either the Mac App Store, as a software update, or through Apple’s Mac Dev Center, to all registered developers. More details after the fold…
* There doesn’t look to be any major new features in DP 7, but we are currently installing it on our machines and will be sure to report back with anything of note. In the meantime, here’s some release notes (via 9to5Mac):
* Apple first introduced OS X Mavericks at WWDC in June. It will be available to the public this fall, bringing along a number of new features including Maps and iBooks apps, Safari improvements, and much more.
