* It seems like the tech world collectively chuckled and rolled its eyes when it found out that Ashton Kutcher—the stoner star from That 70’s Show and Hollywood’s go-to guy for b-rated romantic comedies—was going to be playing Steve Jobs in a feature film.
* But Kutcher has turned more than a few heads with his portrayal of Apple’s co-founder in Open Road Films’ ‘Jobs.’ And looking at this clip of his appearance on Jay Leno’s Tonight Show from last night, he obviously had tremendous respect for the man…
* Here’s the clip (via Cult of Mac):

* The way he talks about Steve Jobs, and how much he regrets missing out on the chance to meet him really struck a chord with me. And I know a lot of folks had similar feelings when they found out Jobs had passed away. I can’t believe it’s been almost 2 years.
* Side note: a lot of folks don’t know this about Kutcher, but he is extremely involved in the tech space. As co-founder of the venture capital fund A-Grade, the actor has invested in several notable Internet companies including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Path.
* All this is to say that I’m very much looking forward to seeing Jobs. After a several month delay, it should start hitting theaters on August 16.
