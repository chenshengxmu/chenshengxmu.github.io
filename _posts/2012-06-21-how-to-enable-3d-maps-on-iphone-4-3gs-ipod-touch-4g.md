* One of the biggest new features of iOS 6 is the new reinvigorated Maps app, which no longer relies on data from Google. The new Maps app also features turn-by-turn directions, and 3D capabilities.
* Sadly, for owners of older devices like the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 3GS, you’ll get the new Maps app sans 3D capabilities or turn-by-turn directions. As usual, the jailbreak community has come through with a solution to at least one of the omissions — 3D maps.
* Check inside as we walk you through adding 3D maps to your officially unsupported older device…
* Note: This works for the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and the iPod touch 4th generation. You must have iOS 6 installed on your device to follow this tutorial.
* Step 1: Jailbreak your iOS 6 installation using the tethered jailbreak.
* Step 2: Install Cydia.
* Step 3: Install iFile from Cydia, and then use this link to install the 3D Enabler package. Afterwards, kill the Maps app, and reopen it, and the 3D Maps icon should now be permanently visible.
* Readers and viewers have also informed me that you can use Ryan Petrich’s iOS 6 beta repo (http://rpetri.ch/ios6/) to install Unlock iOS 6 Maps — a package that will accomplish the same thing. Whatever route you decide to take, having 3D maps on your older device is only a few steps away.
* Have you enabled 3D maps on your older device yet? If so, which method did you use?
