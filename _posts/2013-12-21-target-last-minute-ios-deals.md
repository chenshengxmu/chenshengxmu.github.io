* Great news for folks who still have some Christmas shopping left to do: Target has announced that it will be holding a last-minute sale on select iPhones and iPads next week. The promotion is slated to begin on Sunday, December 22 and run through the 24th.
* The sale will allow customers to snag a 16GB iPhone 5c for just $30—with a two-year agreement of course—along with a free $30 gift card, or an entry-level iPhone 5s for just $179.99 and a free $25 gift card. The retailer will also discount select iPads as well…
* It looks like these deals are limited to in-store purchases only, but with Christmas just a few days away, shipping is kind of out of the question anyway. And for those close to a Target location, it looks like going into the store today may save you a few bucks.
