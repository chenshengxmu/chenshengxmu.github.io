* Earlier today, Apple unexpectedly released a new version of iOS. The update brought the firmware to version 6.1.4, and only included a single item in its change log: an updated audio profile for the iPhone 5.
* Folks who are currently jailbroken on iOS 6.1.2 or lower should obviously stay away from the evasi0n-killing software. But for those of you who already updated, there’s a new version of TinyUmbrella out…
* This afternoon, notcom posted on the TinyUmbrella blog that a new version of the popular SHSH blob-saving tool was out with support for today’s iOS update. So if you’re on an iPhone 5, running iOS 6.1.4, you’ll want to grab it.
* We’re often asked why we recommend saving SHSH blobs for firmware that won’t likely be jailbroken. And the answer is, it’s better to be safe than sorry. There’s no way of knowing what will come in handy down the line, and what won’t.
* As always, you can find the latest version of TinyUmbrella on our Downloads page. And if you need help, we have an excellent step-by-step tutorial on how to backup your iOS device’s SHSH blobs using the app.
* Any questions?
