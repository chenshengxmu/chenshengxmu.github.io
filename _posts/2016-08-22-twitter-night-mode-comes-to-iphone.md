* Available on Android since early-summer, Twitter’s Night Mode option has now expanded to its free mobile app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, the company said Monday. If you constantly check Twitter at night or scan your timeline before nap time, this option may help you have a good night’s sleep as Night Mode enables a darker appearance that’s much more appropriate for using Twitter at night.
* To enable Night Mode, hit the Me tab and then tap the gear icon to access settings. To enable the feature, tap Turn on Night Mode, or deselect the option to turn the feature off.
* Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be an option present in settings for a scheduled Night Mode to automatically enable this mode during certain times of day.
* Twitter is available at no charge on the App Store.
* For more details, see Twitter’s help document.
