* This year’s “S-upgrade” to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus should introduce “the biggest camera jump ever,” as Apple pundit John Gruber claimed on his Daring Fireball blog. Numerous rumors have pointed to a resolution upgrade in the form of a twelve-megapixel camera on the back.
* Thursday, an unconfirmed internal document that surfaced on Chinese microblogging website Weibo suggested that the back-facing camera of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will also capture video in 4K resolution.
* If true, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will mark the first time Apple’s smartphone, or any other Apple device for that matter, has implemented 4K video capture.
* Other features in tow for the forthcoming iPhone upgrade: a 30 percent faster Touch ID fingerprint scanner, a version of the device with pink aluminum back and white front, a five-megapixel front-facing FaceTime camera and a protruding camera lens on the back.
* The documents, which can be seen below, indicate that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are internally referred to as “N66” and “N71,” respectively.
* In addition to 4K recording, the next iPhone’s camera is said to support slow-motion capabilities by recording video in up to 240 frames per second.

* The present-generation iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus also support 240FPS slow-motion video capture, while the iPhone 5s’s Slow-Mo mode tops out at 120FPS.
* The internal memo was posted by an alleged employee of Foxconn, the world’s leading contract fabricator which assembles iPhones, iPads and many other Apple products and gadgets by other vendors.
* Shortly after posting the document on Weibo, user “KJuma” took it down without explanation, fueling speculation that the internal memo is indeed authentic.
* In addition to improved camera capabilities, the upcoming iPhones should run Apple’s next-generation “A9” processor with 2GB RAM, incorporate force-sensing Force Touch screen technology, introduce a new rose gold color option and more.
* Mass production of the handsets should kick off in August.
