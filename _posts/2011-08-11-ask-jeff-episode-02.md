* I have to admit, the first episode of Ask Jeff was a much bigger success than I thought it would be, but apparently you guys have a lot of questions that you want answered!
* In this second episode of what I intend to develop into an ongoing weekly series, I tackle all sorts of questions, and I do mean, all sorts.
* If you guys are interested in my favorite jailbreak tweaks, or even my favorite cereal, yes, I said cereal, then check inside for episode 02…
* As I’ve previously stated, I try my hardest to answer as many questions as I can each week. If yours doesn’t get answered this week, please keep asking.
* Also, if you want a little more visibility, be sure to post the question on the video page on our official YouTube channel as well.
* What did you think about this week’s episode?
