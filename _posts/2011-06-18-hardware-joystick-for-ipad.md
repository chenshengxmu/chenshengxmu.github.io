* We love the iPad as a gaming device as much as the next person, but we just can’t help but feel hampered by the lack of buttons. Granted that the large, 9.7″ touch-enabled display does have its advantages when it comes to changing the way we think about games, but there are some times when a pair of good ol’ fashioned joysticks would come in handy.
* Apparently we aren’t alone in thinking such thoughts, with the JOYSTICK-IT proving that sometimes prodding things with your finger isn’t always the best way to go.
* With iPad gaming, at least…
* Retailing at a not-too-wallet-busting $24.99, or $39.99 for a pair, the JOYSTICK-IT is a handy thumb stick made out of lightweight aluminum that attaches atop any on-screen control, providing a seamless gaming experience. As TIPB points out, it’s certainly one good looking piece of equipment!
* “Bring your tablet-based gaming to the next level with the JOYSTICK-IT Tablet Arcade Stick. The JOYSTICK-IT gives you a real physical joystick for increased precision with touchscreen based games. Simply press down to attach the JOYSTICK-IT to your tablet based computer’s screen for improved gaming. No wires or batteries needed.”
* If, like us, you find yourself struggling to compete with the high-scores posted by your friends because you just can’t quite adapt to the idea of having no feedback when you’re moving a virtual joystick, then the JOYSTICK-IT could be the game-saving accessory for you.
* The JOYSTICK-IT is currently available to buy from ThinkGeek, and is in-stock. Please do let us know if you pick one (or two) up and share your thoughts on whether your game improved as a result.
* In fact, where did that iDB credit card go…
