* Great news Reckless Racing fans, the third iteration of Pixelbite’s popular top-down racer is now available on iOS. You can pick up the new game, which is universal, so it’ll work with both your iPhone and iPad, for $4.99 from the App Store.
* The original Reckless Racing debuted in 2010, as a delightful birds-eye-view rally racing game with beautiful graphics. Reckless Racing 3 continues that tradition with dirtier tracks, better visuals, and its largest selection of cars and trucks ever.
