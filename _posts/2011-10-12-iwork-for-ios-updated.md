* If you’re just tuning in to iDB today, Apple is in the middle of seeding several major software updates and releases. The Cupertino company just released iOS 5, and now they’ve pushed out updates for the iWork software suite.
* Along with the new mobile software, iCloud has started rolling out to the masses. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote have all been updated to support Apple’s new sync and storage service…
* The new update enables you to work on iWork projects across multiple devices. That means that you can create a document on your iPhone, and once it’s synced with iCloud you will be able to access and edit it from your iPad or computer.
* “iCloud makes it easy to move Pages, Keynote, and Numbers documents between your computer and your iOS devices. Just sign in to iCloud.com/iwork in any modern browser, and all your iWork for iOS documents will be there — complete with your most recent edits. Click a document to download it in iWork ’09, Microsoft Office, or PDF format. You can also drag and drop any iWork ’09 or Microsoft Office document from your computer into one of the iWork apps on iCloud.com, and it automatically appears on all your iOS devices, ready for you to review, edit, or present.”
* If you want to check out the new iWork suite, the updated version of each app can be found in the App Store. Click here for Pages, here for Numbers, and here for Keynote. Obviously you must have iOS 5 for iCloud integration to work.
