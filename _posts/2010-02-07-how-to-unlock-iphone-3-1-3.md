* The first step is to jailbreak your iPhone 3.1.3, either with RedSn0w or with PwnageTool. Note that PwnageTool is the preferred method as it helps preserve the baseband.
* You can use UltraSn0w to unlock these basebands:
* To find out what your baseband is, go to Settings > General > About > Modem Firmware.
* Your iPhone should now be unlocked. If you have questions or comments on how to unlock iPhone firmware 3.1.3, please leave a comment.
