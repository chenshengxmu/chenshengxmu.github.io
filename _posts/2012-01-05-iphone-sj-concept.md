* Antonio De Rosa has come up with yet another awesome iPhone concept, a handset he called the iPhone SJ because it was inspired by the late Steve Jobs.
* Shown off in all its glory at De Rosa’s ADR Studio website, the concept takes the existing iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S body and reinvents it, creating a gorgeous concept that even Jony Ive himself would be pleased to call his own.
* While the specs are not the biggest thing here, De Rosa speculates that the concept could come packed with a dual-core A6 chip and a 10 megapixel camera. That’s probably not too far from what we would expect Apple to put inside the iPhone 5…
* The biggest feature of this concept has to be the full glass front panel which would pack a capacitive screen edge-to-edge. Built atop a lightweight polycarbonate body, that screen looks absolutely gorgeous in the renders and just makes us wish it was a real iPhone even more!
* Apple is expected to bring the iPhone 5 to market later this year, possibly as late as October, should the company wish to stick to its new release cadence. After the iPhone 4S’s lack of a redesigned chassis, all bets are off as to what Apple has planned this time around.
* Just a word of warning Apple: if the next iPhone does not look just like this concept, we’re all going to be very, very disappointed!
