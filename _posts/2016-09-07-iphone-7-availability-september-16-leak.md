* The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus should go on sale Friday, September 16, meaning Apple will be collecting pre-orders for the device for about a week following today’s unveiling. September 16 retail availability for the device was mentioned Wednesday by Italian outlet iPhoneItalia.it, based on suspected photographs showing alleged iPhone 7 box design. On a related note, web reports out of China are claiming that the iPhone 7 is now shipping out to various countries in preparation for launch.
* According to the publication’s sources, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus should be available in Italy through carriers TIM, 3 and Vodafone beginning September 16. Italy is typically among the first wave of launch countries for new iPhones.
* The sources cautioned that launch inventory of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be “very limited” in the country. Although the photo top of post clearly spells out the “iPhone 7” name, the tops are missing product images as on iPhone 6s packaging.
* AppleInsider suspects that the boxes “may simply be awaiting the images in label form.”
* On a related note, supply chain sources told Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes that first iPhone 7 shipments are going out worldwide in preparation for launch.
