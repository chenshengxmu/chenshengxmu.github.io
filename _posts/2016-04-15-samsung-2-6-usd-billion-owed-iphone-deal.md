* Apple has reportedly brokered a deal with its South Korean frenemy Samsung, worth an estimated $2.59 billion, to supply OLED panels for future iPhones, scheduled to ship in 2017. Citing sources familiar with Samsung’s plans, The Korea Herald reported Friday that Samsung’s mobile display making arm, Samsung Display, will manufacture about hundred million OLED panels annually, measuring 5.5 inches diagonally, starting next year.
* UPDATE: The whole article was pulled shortly after it was published, probably because, you know, Apple is not fond of such leaks.
* The two companies are expected to maintain the OLED supply agreement for at least three years.
* “Under the deal, Samsung Display will supply around 100 million units of 5.5-inch panels annually, with the value being estimated at 3 trillion won ($2.59 billion),” reads the article. Samsung Display declined to confirm the deal, citing its privacy policy.
* The article doesn’t mention whether or not Samsung will produce 4.7-inch OLED panels for future iPhones. Prior rumors have suggested that OLED display technology might be exclusive to the larger ‘Plus’ model of a future iPhone.
* A jump from the traditional LCD IPS screens to OLED panels would bring greatly reduced power consumption to Apple’s future iPhones because the LCD display and its backlighting are the biggest power draws in an iPhone.
* More important than that, an OLED iPhone would render crisper colors and deeper blacks and have greatly improved visibility in bright sunlight conditions.
