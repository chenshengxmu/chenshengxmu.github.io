* Chpwn, one of my favorite jailbreak apps developers, came up with a brilliant idea to figure out what mods and jailbreak apps iPhone users want and need. It’s called Tweak Tracker and it’s dead simple.
* Anyone can submit tweaks or apps ideas to the website. Then anyone can vote on those same ideas. The one that make it to the top obviously get more chances of being developed.
* I think Tweak Tracker is a great idea. The only downside I can see is that it will eventually get spammed and will have duplicate entries.
* Go check it out then come back here and tell us what tweaks you’d like to see developed for the iPhone.
