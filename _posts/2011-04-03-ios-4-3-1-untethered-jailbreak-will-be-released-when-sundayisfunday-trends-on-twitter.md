* Get your Twitter hats on folks, and start promoting #sundayisfunday!
* Stefan Esser, the hacker who found the untethered exploit in iOS 4.3.1, says that, “Maybe that would make the dev-team release.”
* As we previously reported, Esser, who goes by i0n1c on Twitter, provided the untether to the DevTeam so that they could use it in the upcoming releases of RedSn0w and PwnageTool — the jailbreak supports all devices capable of running iOS 4.3.1, except for the iPad 2…

* Now, just like in previous big jailbreak releases, the DevTeam wants you to show how much you want these tools.
* When #sundayisfunday starts trending on Twitter, then they will release the new versions of RedSn0w and PwnageTool.
* But you don’t have to sit on Twitter refreshing all morning, as soon as it’s released we will announce it here. As always, we will provide you with a step-by-step how to jailbreak guide as well.
* It’s coming today folks, are you excited?
