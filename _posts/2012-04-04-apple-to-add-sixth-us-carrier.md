* Apple is obviously looking to expand its outreach by adding as many carrier partners as possible — a method which has helped Android garner a majority of the smartphone market over the past year.

* Update: MacRumors has just received word that three additional regional carriers have announced iPhone partnerships today, bringing the total number of US iPhone partners to 8:
