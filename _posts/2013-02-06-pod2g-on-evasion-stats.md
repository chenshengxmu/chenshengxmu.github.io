* We’ve been keeping close tabs on the popularity of the evasi0n jailbreak since it was released on Monday. Within the first 10 minutes, it saw over 100,000 downloads. And yesterday morning, Saurik said that it had crossed the 1.7 million mark.
* Today, pod2g shares even more interesting stats on the jailbreak, noting that the evasi0n website has seen more than 5 million unique visitors, and 40 million page views in the last few days. Here’s a breakdown of all of that traffic by country…
* From pod2g’s blog:
* Interesting questions from my followers regarding origins of traffic:
* Overall, not many surprises here. China and the United States are Apple’s top two markets, so it makes sense that they are at the top. For the time being, though, the order is reversed. But Tim Cook says it won’t be long before China overtakes the US.
* So far, the stats have been impressive, and it’ll be interesting to see what they look like at the end of the week. For comparison, the Google Maps app saw 10 million downloads in its first 2 days on the App Store. And I’ll bet evasi0n has done at least half that.
