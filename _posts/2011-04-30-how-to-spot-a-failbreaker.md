* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the latest iPad 2 jailbreak news, let me bring you up to speed. Last week there was an unknown Twitter user proclaiming that he had created an iPad 2 jailbreak. He uploaded videos and pictures of what seemed to be an iPad 2 running Cydia.
* He built up close to 1000 Twitter followers, and even had media outlets (including us) mentioning his work on Apple’s tablet. Although we maintained a certain level of skepticism, a part of us wanted to believe the photos and the videos were real.
* Some people got so wrapped up in their beliefs, that they blindly downloaded an unknown EXE file from the hacker. He claimed that this was the iPad 2 jailbreak everyone was waiting for. Luckily, it was nothing more than a simple app designed to error out. It could have easily been something much more malicious.
* For folks who are looking for help to dismiss future fakes, the Chronic Dev Team have posted a video on their GreenPois0n website that educates the average joe on how to spot a fake video of a jailbreak.
* The Chronic Dev Team’s GreenPois0n software has been a staple in the jailbreak community for the last few years. They are currently working on a real iPad 2 jailbreak, but have stated as recently as last week that it is no where close to being done.
* While the fake jailbreak from last week can be written off as a bad prank, the next time folks may not be so lucky. We encourage you to check back here for the latest information on an official iPad 2 jailbreak.
