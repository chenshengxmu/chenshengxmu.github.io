* Apple has created a brand new company-maintained account on Twitter dedicated to tips, tricks and customer service. @AppleSupport provides “tips and tutorials from the same Apple Advisors you know and trust,” according to the company.
* The first tip shared on Apple Support on Twitter is about turning lists into checklists in the updated Notes app on OS X El Capitan and iOS 9.
* “We’re here to provide tips, tricks and helpful information when you need it most, and if you have a question, well – we’re here to help with that too,” reads the description on the account’s bio page on Twitter.
* The Notes app has some awesome hidden tricks. A favorite of ours: how to turn lists into checklists. #AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/6fdzsRT1i4
* — Apple Support (@AppleSupport) March 3, 2016
* It appears that the account won’t be “static” as the company has already responded to numerous queries by customers, directing some of them to the relevant AppleCare staff or, in some cases, asking customers to provide additional details about the problems they’ve encountered in a Direct Message.
