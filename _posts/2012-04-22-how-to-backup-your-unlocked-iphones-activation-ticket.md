* Earlier this morning iPhone Dev Team member MuscleNerd recommended that all who unlock their iPhone using the SAM method backup their activation ticket for future use.
* To do so, he suggested that we backup everything contained in this folder: /var/root/Library/Lockdown/ for each SIM card that we use. If you have iFile installed on your jailbroken iPhone, then you can securely backup your activation ticket in less than 5 minutes.
* Check out our video how to inside…
* Note: You will need to perform this for each SIM card that you use to unlock. So for instance, if you have an Orange SIM card, pop out your T-Mobile SIM, and perform the exact same steps while connected to the Orange network.
* Step 1: Download iFile from Cydia
* Step 2: Open iFile and navigate to /var/root/Library/
* Step 3: Tap edit in the upper right-hand corner, and tap the circle next to the Lockdown folder.
* Step 4: Tap the Zip button at the bottom of the screen (second from the left), and name your file something that you can recognize. For instance, if you’re currently on your T-Mobile sim, name it Lockdown-Tmobile.
* Step 5: Once your zip file is created, scroll down to the bottom of the page to find it. Tap the circle next to your zip file, and tap the mail button. This will allow you to email the zip file as an attachment to save for future use.
* That’s all there is to it. Your activation ticket is now safe and sound for future use if needed.
* Stay tuned for more coverage on the SAM unlock, as there are sure to be additional revelations and tutorials surrounding this exciting new unlock possibility for the iPhone.
