* Apple on Tuesday released iOS 11.2.5, watchOS 4.2.2, macOS 10.13.3 and tvOS 11.2.5 to the public, after more than a month of beta testing. Users can install the updates using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism, or you can visit our Downloads page.
* iOS 11.2.5 comes just two weeks after the release of iOS 11.2.2, which introduced a patch for the Spectre vulnerability. As we discovered in the beta, today’s update is focused on under-the-hood improvements, with a fix for the bug that caused the Messages app to freeze, support for the HomePod and Siri News—a feature that allows Siri to play audible news updates.
* Here is the full change log:

HomePod support Setup and automatically transfer your Apple ID, Apple Music, Siri and Wi-Fi settings to HomePod. Siri News Siri can now read the news, just ask, “Hey Siri, play the news”. You can also ask for specific news categories including Sports, Business or Music.

* There’s really nothing new of note here. Apple’s release notes simply say that watchOS 4.2.2 “includes improvements and bug fixes.”
* Today’s macOS update is also focused on improvements. According to the release notes, that includes additional fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, a fix for the App Store bug that allowed the menu in System Preferences to be unlocked with any password, and a fix for the bug in the Messages app.

* Similar to watchOS 4.2.2, today’s tvOS update doesn’t really include anything new of note. Expect more bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements here.
* We’re still installing today’s updates, and will be sure to report back with any new changes. And as always, if you see something new we’ve missed, be sure to let us know about it in the comments below!
