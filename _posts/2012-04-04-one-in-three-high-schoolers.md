* So this is pretty interesting: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray‘s senior Apple analyst, published a report yesterday claiming that one in three U.S. high school students now own an iPhone.
* The data comes from the firm’s semi-annual survey of U.S. teens, in which they poll over 5,500 high school students to see what technology they’re currently in to…
* According to the survey results, 34% of participating students own Apple’s popular handset — double the percentage reported in last year’s poll. On top of that, 40% indicated that they intend to purchase an iPhone within the next 6 months.
* Apple proved to be even more popular with teen tablet owners. Out of the 34% of high school students that said they owned a tablet — 70% of them were iPad users. That’s a big chunk compared to the 19% that said they owned an Android tablet, and the 11% with Kindle Fires.
* While these numbers aren’t surprising — the iPhone 4S is currently the most popular handset in the U.S., and the iPad has long-since controlled the tablet market — they do give us some insight as to what’s popular in the technology world among U.S. teens.
* Perhaps HTC’s Chris Weber would be interested in these results.
