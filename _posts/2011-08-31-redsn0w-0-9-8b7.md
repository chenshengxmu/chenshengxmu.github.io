* The latest version of RedSn0w 0.9.8b was recently released by the Dev Team, and it includes two key components.
* The first component, is compatibility with the iPad 1 iOS 5 beta 6 IPSW. Apparently, Apple updated this IPSW without altering its version or filename, so this latest version of RedSn0w features compatibility with both the original and updated files…
* Secondly, you’ll find support for a tethered 4.3.5 (GSM) or 4.2.10 (CDMA) jailbreak, instead of the old method of pointing to the outdated 4.3.4/4.2.9 IPSW’s. The team also claims to have fixed an issues with the CDMA version as well. Check inside for the release notes and downloads for both the Mac and Windows versions.
* Here are the release notes from the Dev Team:
* “Apple updated the iPad1 iOS5b6 IPSW without changing its version number or filename, so we’re releasing redsn0w 0.9.8b7 to handle both the original and changed IPSW. We’ve also added explicit support for a tethered 4.3.5/4.2.10 jailbreak (instead of pointing at the 4.3.4/4.2.9 IPSWs) and fixed a 4.2.10 problem.”
* You can find RedSn0w 0.9.8b7 along with other versions of RedSn0w in our downloads section.
* Again, keep in mind that all of these jailbreaks are of the tethered variety, and we’ll most likely have to wait until after iOS 5 officially goes public, before we get access to an untethered jailbreak.
* With that in mind, have you decided to go ahead and take the jump, or do you still plan on holding off?
