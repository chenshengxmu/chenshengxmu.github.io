* As the iPhone 5 nears the end of its 12-month life cycle, rumors regarding Apple’s next-generation handset are beginning to pick up. It’s believed that the phone, which is expected to be called the iPhone 5S, is already in production.
* And when devices go into production, it becomes harder to control component leaks. That might explain how the folks who took these two photos got their hands on what appears to be a nearly complete (minus the display) iPhone 5S…
* Here’s MacRumors:
* “MacRumors has received several images that appear to show both the interior and rear shell of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 5S. The device appears to carry the same redesigned logic board that appeared earlier this week, suggesting that this is indeed a new iPhone.”
* The site then goes on to point out some interesting things in the above photo of the inside of the alleged iPhone 5S. For example, notice how the large chip isn’t labeled as an A6 or A7. It’s possible that this particular device is just a prototype.
* They also note that the battery carries a more recent Apple part number of 616-0652 compared to the iPhone 5 battery, which has carried part numbers -0611 and -06113. And it has a higher capacity of 5.92Whr, compared to the 5’s 5.45 Whr.
* And now for the back:

* The first thing you’ll notice about this rear shell is that it looks almost exactly like the iPhone 5. And that’s fine, because nearly everything we’ve heard up to this point has suggested the next iPhone will look identical to its predecessor.
* There is one major difference though—check out the larger, pill-shaped window for the LED flash next to the iSight camera. This too matches up with previous 5S reports we’ve seen, which all say the handset will sport a dual LED flash.
* Not much else is known about the next-generation iPhone, though. Rumors of the handset have called for everything from an all-new A7 processor, to a built-in fingerprint sensor, and many think the device will come in several colors.
* Whatever it is, you can bet Apple will be unveiling it this fall. With no new mobile products out this year yet, the company is expected to have another big holiday season with two new iPads, a new iPhone, and possibly a new budget handset.
