* Apple has apparently begun revamping some of its Apple Store logos with green leaves tonight, in honor of Earth Day. The annual event, which falls on April 22nd, is used to promote environmental protection and the overall improvement of the health of the environment, via demonstrations, organized events, and more.
* The move shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as we already knew Apple was planning some kind of celebration for Earth Day at select retail locations. We also saw a major PR push from the company yesterday regarding its environmental efforts, including new hardware recycling options and a video with Tim Cook…
* As you can see in the image above, taken by Instagram user znnina (via MacRumors), Apple isn’t making the entire Apple logo green—just the leaf. The change has been spotted by a number of Apple Store customers around the globe, and it looks like many employees are also wearing special green, Earth Day shirts as well.
* This isn’t the first time that Apple has been so visibly supportive of an annual awareness day. Back in December, several Apple Stores around the world colored their entire Apple logos red in support of World AIDS Day — a dedicated (annual) event for raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV.
* The two causes are particularly important to the Cupertino firm, who has long been a Product RED partner, and was recently recognized by Greenpeace for its efforts to ‘build a cleaner Internet.’ In fact, the environmental group gave Apple a perfect Clean Energy Index score of 100%—some 50% above the next tech company.
