* Ahead of tomorrow’s education-focused event, the Apple Events app for tvOS has been updated with Apple Pencil-like sketch and stylized logo matching the official invite.
* The splash screen in the refreshed software serves as yet another confirmation that this particular event won’t be live-streamed like Apple’s other, higher-profile media events.
* “Watch the special event—held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois—after it concludes,” reads a message in the app.
* The presentation will be held at the Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday, March 27 at 10am. According to the invitation, it will be a time to “hear creative new ideas for teachers and students”. A calligraphy Apple logo adorns the simplistic design.
* As is our wont, we have prepared a set of nice Field Trip event-themed wallpapers for your Apple devices.
* Apple’s overhauled low-cost 9.7-inch iPad should ship sometime in the third quarter. Some people are saying that an edu-iPad of sorts might improve Apple’s standing in education.
* Are you looking forward to this particular event, and why?
