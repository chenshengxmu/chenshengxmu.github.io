* When Apple launched the Apple TV 4th generation, many people were surprised that they didn’t include a Gigabit Ethernet port. It appears that Apple has reversed its decision on the latest, Apple TV 4K.
* Though most of the changes to the upcoming Apple TV 4K are internal, one notable change to the exterior is the addition of a Gigabit Ethernet port. Apple in the past heavily pushed connecting to your network wirelessly, and included only a 10/100 speed Ethernet port. That meant that you could connect over Wi-Fi 802.11ac and achieve better speeds than if you connected through Ethernet.
* With the new Apple TV 4K, you have the option to connect over 802.11ac Wi‑Fi with MIMO, or using the Gigabit Ethernet port. That will help as it requires users to have 15Mbps speeds to stream 4K content.
