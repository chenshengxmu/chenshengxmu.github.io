* Bloomberg reports Samsung has been chosen by Apple to make chips for the next iPhone, taking the business from Taiwan Semiconductor.
* Samsung has reclaimed its spot as Apple’s supplier. TSMC made the chips for the iPhone 6, however before that, Samsung’s chips were king for iPhones.
* There’s no official confirmation from Apple and Samsung –  just Bloomberg citing “people with direct knowledge of the matter”.
* Readers may be confused why Apple would choose a competitor to manufacture its chips, but it’s worth noting the mobile and semiconductor businesses of Samsung are completely separate and run by different executives.
* The Galaxy smartphones in Samsung Mobile’s division have been struggling after the iPhone 6 has taken markets like the United States and China by storm. Samsung’s new deal could help boost the balance sheet of the entire Samsung conglomerate.
* Korea Times reported in November that Samsung would replace TSMC, but not until 2016. If Bloomberg’s report turns to be true, Samsung is getting Apple’s business earlier than believed.
* Researcher Gartner recently reported Apple spent $25.8 billion on chips last year, accounting for 7.6 percent of industry purchases – making it a pretty big win for Samsung.
