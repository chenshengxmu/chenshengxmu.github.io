* With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, developer Niantic Labs today announced that a special Valentine’s Day-themed event is available in Pokémon GO beginning today, February 8 at 11am PT / 2pm ET and running through February 15.
* During this special  in-game promotion, players will be treated to double the amount of candy every time they catch, hatch and transfer Pokémon. Plus, their Buddy Pokémon will find candy twice as fast.
* Other Valentine Day’s perks in Pokémon GO include more frequent encounters of Chansey, Clefable and many other pink Pokémon. Additionally, Cleffa, Igglybuff and Smoochum will be more likely to hatch from eggs.
* “And to help you paint your town pink this Valentine’s Day, Lure Modules will last for six hours for the entire duration of the event,” said Niantic.
* As mentioned, the limited-time event will only be available from 11am PT on February 8 to 11am PT on February 15, the day after Valentine’s Day.
* Grab Pokémon GO at no charge from App Store.
