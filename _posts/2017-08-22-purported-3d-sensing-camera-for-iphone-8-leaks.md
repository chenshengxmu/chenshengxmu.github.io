* Tuesday, an image surfaced on leak aggregator SlashLeaks of Apple’s alleged 3D-sensing camera destined for iPhone 8, sporting an infrared transmitter and emitter.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously explained that iPhone 8 would have a much improved front camera with advanced functions beyond taking 2D photos, including depth-sensing for better augmented reality, plus 3D selfies, scanning and facial recognition.
* Barclays added that both front and rear cameras should have these 3D sensors.
* Code strings uncovered from the HomePod firmware have suggested that the FaceTime camera on iPhone 8 could support 4K video capture at a silky smooth 60 frames per second.
* People in the know have warned that similar strings appeared in iOS code in the past meaning they should not be taken as a tell-tale sign that those features will in fact appear on iPhone 8.
* Other alleged iPhone 8 components have recently leaked out through Asian factories ahead of the handset’s introduction next month, including an OLED display assembly featuring a notch at the top and an inductive wireless charging printed circuit board.
* What do you say, is this the real deal or an unrelated part?
