* You’ve seen Samsung’s anti-iPhone newspaper ad (and a Nokia fan’s take) that takes a jab at the incoming iPhone 5.
* The advertisement has caused quite a stir with its “it doesn’t take a genius” tagline (an obvious reference to Apple Store Geniuses) and a laundry list of features focusing on the bigger display on the Galaxy SIII, twice the RAM and stuff like standard micro-USB plug, expandable SD card storage and swappable battery.
* Taking a page from Samsung marketing department’s book, an Apple fan created a spoof that goes a long way proving that a spec matrix can often be a double-edged sword…
* Here’s an Apple fanboy’s side-by-side comparison of the iPhone 5 and Samsung’s Galaxy SIII, courtesy of Reddit.

* And this is Samsung’s print ad.

* Both versions selectively leave features off to make the other phone come across as a less capable handset. I wonder how Samsung’s ad would look like in a Galaxy S4 variant.
* Now, I ain’t trying to make a case for either phone here.
* Us here at iDB are obviously fans of Apple.
* But every smartphone has some glaring omissions and major downsides to it, Apple’s iPhone included. In my view, each persons is entitled to settle with a device that best suit their needs, be it Apple, Google, Samsung or any other vendor.
* Sure, Samsung’s ad appeals to the types who care about specs and nothing but specs. But from the general public’s standpoint, I doubt technical jargon like S Beam, S Voice or Palm Touch Mute Pause conveys any meaningful message.
* In case you were wondering, a technique Samsung used in its print ad is called The Ben Franklin Close, otherwise known as The Balance Sheet Close.
* In a nutshell, it comes down to listing all of the qualities of your product or service in a row and put a comparable product or service in the other row and intentionally leave out competing qualities that trumpet yours.
* Make no mistake about it, Apple is also using this technique to sell you an iPhone.
* Summarizing your product’s benefits this way (usually) yields desired results. But as effective as this sales technique is, it can as well backfire when your audience is well-informed.
* Here’s something else, for balance.

* I hope we can all get along nicely and share meaningful thoughts down in comments.
