* In iOS 10, each individual contact in the Contacts app now has a dedicated switch, called Emergency Bypass, which overrides the Do Not Disturb feature for that person. This handy new feature lets you permit audio and vibratory alerts from a specific person in your Contacts even when Do Not Disturb is enabled globally in your device’s Settings app.
* iOS currently supports enabling Do Not Disturb mode globally and for individual chats in Messages, so this marks the first time the feature has been made available on a per-contact basis. Check out how Emergency Bypass works and tell us how you liked, or didn’t like it in the comment section.
* Emergency Bypass isn’t as straightforward as one would expect.
* You must first launch Contacts, select a person and then tap the Edit button to enter the contact editing mode. Next, tap Ringtone or Text Tone section on the contact card.
* On the next screen, you should see a switch called Emergency Bypass.
* “Emergency Bypass allows sounds and vibrations from this person even when Do Not Disturb is on,” reads the feature’s description.
* Hat tip goes to iDownloadBlog reader C. R.
* What’s your take on Emergency Bypass, will you be using it when iOS 10 releases this fall, and if not, why?
