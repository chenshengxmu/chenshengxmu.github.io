* Apple on Thursday published a new commercial for iPad Pro via its official YouTube channel.
* Titled “What’s a Computer“ and running sixty seconds long, it challenges the definition of a PC whilst demonstrating various iPad Pro and iOS 11 productivity and multitasking features that make the Apple tablet a viable computer replacement for many people.
* And here it is.
* Song: “Go” by Louis The Child
* “With iPad Pro + iOS 11, a post-PC world may be closer than you think,” reads the video’s description. The clip clearly follows Apple’s established concept which positions iPad Pro as the ultimate computer replacement.
* I’ve generally been a big fan of iPad Pro advertising and think this video does a fine job of laying out the benefits of the tablet form factor in layman’s terms.
* How do you like this ad?
* Sound off in the comments!
