* Now that Electra has been publicly available for a couple of weeks, we’re starting to see some iOS 11-oriented jailbreak tweaks surface in Cydia alongside those made for iOS 10 jailbreaks like G0blin and Yalu.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the new jailbreak tweaks released throughout the last week. As usual, we’ll kick things off by showcasing our favorites and then outline the rest afterward.

* LetMeKnow is a  jailbreak tweak that provides subtle haptic feedback whenever your phone calls connect or disconnect.
* In noisy environments, this tweak can be a godsend, but it can also appease other uses depending on how you use your device for telecommunications.
* You can read our full review of LetMeKnow to see if it’s right for you.

* Built by the creator of the Electra jailbreak tool himself, NoLargeTitles reverts iOS 11’s large and clunky header titles back to the way they looked in iOS 10 and earlier.
* This effect is system-wide, so it should work in various pre-installed apps such as Mail, Music, Settings, and others.
* You can read our full review of NoLargeTitles to learn whether you should download it on your jailbroken iOS 11 device or not.

* SpotLight has a nasty habit of remembering your latest search query for the next time you try to use it, and SpotClearClose is a new jailbreak tweak that prevents that from happening.
* With SpotClearClose, you can use SpotLight with a sense of privacy. Upon swiping to the widget page of your Home Screen, you won’t see what your last search query was about, and you can start entirely fresh.
* You can learn more about SpotClearClose and whether you should download it in our full review.
