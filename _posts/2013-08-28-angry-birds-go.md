* It’s easy to downplay the wild success Rovio’s enjoyed with the Angry Birds games like no one is interested when in reality people continue to play and buy everything related to the franchise like there’s no tomorrow. It’s also OK not to admit you’re a fan of the series and still be interested in an Angry Birds-themed kart racing game the Finnish developer’s been working on.
* Created in partnership with Austrian energy drink powerhouse Red Bull, Angry Birds Go is much like a few other racing games Red Bull has previously endorsed, though we’re of course expecting something of a twist here…
* Check out the teaser.
* Apart from this teaser video, Rovio has shared little information about the game’s mechanics, availability and price. Developers on their part say they’re “almost ready to share a release date and gameplay trailer” so stay tuned.
* Rovio teased the game in June with a website showing a bird dashing down a pathway.
* “Something new is coming,” reads the website.

* According to Rovio’s introductory blog post, Angry Birds Go is unlike the Angry Birds games you’ve grown to love (or hate).
* Those birds and piggies are getting ready for their most thrilling and action-packed game yet! All your favorite characters are returning for a brand new title that will bring you closer to Piggy Island than ever before.
* It’s Angry Birds, but not as you know it!
* If it lets me build my own vehicles like the DIY machines in Bad Piggies, I’m sold.
* What say you?
* Is this going to be another smash hit or the first huge flop for Rovio?
* I sure as hell hope it won’t be a freemium title as I’d hate to see Rovio rip us off like Electronic Arts and Gameloft have been doing with their newly found focus on free-to-play games.
* For what it’s worth, Red Bull’s involvement gives some hope that Angry Birds Go could be a 100 percent free download, like their other racing games.
