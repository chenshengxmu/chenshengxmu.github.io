* Back in 2013, Apple agreed to settle a two year-old lawsuit with a group of parents over unauthorized in-app purchases made by their kids. The parents claimed that their kids had completed in-app purchases without their knowledge because of an oversight in the way in-app purchases actually work.
* Of course, all this could have been prevented if parents had restricted the usage of in-app purchases in the first place, but admittedly, not everyone knows you can make in-app purchases, and more importantly, I don’t think anyone (especially parents) knows that you can turn off in-app purchases in iOS.
* If you have a kid that uses your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, and if you don’t want to get a bad surprise, it might be a good idea to restrict in-app purchases. This is how to do it.
* Step 1: Go to Settings > General > Restrictions, and tap Enable Restrictions.
* Step 2: You will be required to set a 4 digit passcode. Confirm your passcode by typing it in a second time.
* Step 3: Scroll down a little bit and turn in-app purchases off.

* From now on, no one will be able to make in-app purchases on your device, including you. That means that if you want to make an in-app purchase, you will have to go back to the Settings and turn in-app purchases On again.
* Trying to make an in-app purchase will now result in giving you the error message seen at the top of this post.
* Fortunately, my daughter is still too young to figure out how to download stuff in the App Store, but it’s only a matter of time. I’ll definitely make sure to turn off in-app purchases to prevent any “accidental” download.
