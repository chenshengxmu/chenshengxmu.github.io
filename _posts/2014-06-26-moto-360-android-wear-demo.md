* Among the flurry of announcements yesterday, Android Wear files as the most exciting and talked-about aspect of the Google I/O 2014 keynote.
* To help jumpstart Google’s platform for wearables, both LG’s G Watch and Samsung’s new Gear Live started selling through Google’s Play store yesterday.
* Google also said that Motorola’s Moto 360, announced back in March, will launch later this summer with Android Wear. Motorola has now posted a nice video for those who couldn’t attend Google’s two-day conference for developers.
* It gives a sneak peek at some of the cool features of Android Wear running on premium hardware so give it a quick watch (pun intended) and share your impressions with fellow readers down in the comments…
* The video takes us through some marquee Android Wear features on the Moto 360, such as touching and holding the screen (or a dedicated hardware button) to turn the smartwatch on, swipeable notification cards, voice input and more.
* I like that you can scroll through the notifications by swiping up. You can similarly swipe from left to right to dismiss a notification or swipe in the other direction for options.
* Here it is.
* Sadly, the video doesn’t show one of the coolest features of Android Wear – user authentication. In combination with Android L devices, your Android Wear gadgets can automatically disable the Lock screen code on your smartphone or log you into your Chromebook automatically.
* The opposite is true as well: an Android Wear device can instantly lock all your other devices when you take the watch off.
* And here’s the Moto 360 video tour from March.
* It’s safe to assume that both the Motorola smartwatch and Android Wear have been in development long before Google back in January sold off Motorola’s mobile business to Lenovo for $2.9 billion, which helps explain tight interplay between hardware and software.

* Designed as a classic timepiece, the Moto 360 features OK Google functionality, Google Now alerts and notifications, custom watch designs specifically created for its round face and much more.
* The device uses premium materials to make it feel comfortable and familiar on your wrist. Due for global launch later this summer, the Moto 360 will come in a variety of styles, including the classic leather look and the premium metal finish.
* Android Wear launch partners include hardware vendors Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola and Samsung, chip makers Broadcom, Imagination, Intel, Mediatek and Qualcomm, fashion labels like the Fossil Group and more.
* If anything, this video gives us a pretty good indication of what we can expect from a rumored iWatch.
