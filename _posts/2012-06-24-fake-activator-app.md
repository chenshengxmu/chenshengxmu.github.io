* There appears to be a new trend developing in the App Store: create a crappy application, name it after a popular jailbreak app, and hope folks mistakenly buy it for $0.99.
* Last week we saw a fake Cydia app make its way into Apple’s digital download hub. And now we’ve come across a similar Activator impostor…
* As most of you know, Activator is a popular jailbreak tweak by Ryan Petrich. It allows you to toggle settings and perform other tasks via customizable actions and gestures.
* But Activator, the app that just popped up in the App Store, isn’t anything like that. It certainly looks like it — the screenshots in iTunes are actually of Petrich’s app. But user reviews say it’s nothing more than a low quality wallpaper-maker.
* As of this writing, there’s no disclaimer or warning in the app’s description that says that it’s unrelated to the jailbreak tweak. So make sure you give your less savvy friends a heads up.
* Thanks XysMan!
