title: Tutorial- How to Jailbreak Your iPhone or iPad With Spirit
---
* Spirit has to be the easiest and quickest jailbreak ever. JailbreakMe was fast, but Spirit takes it to a whole new level. I’m not really sure a Spirit tutorial or guide is necessary because it is so simple…
* Before thinking about jailbreaking your iDevice with Spirit, there are a few requirements that you need to know about. Please head over to this post I wrote earlier to read the “fine prints” and make sure you know exactly what you’re doing.
* I wrote this guide by jailbreaking my iPad using Spirit but the steps are exactly identical for the iPod Touch and iPhone. Steps are also identical whether you’re on a Mac or PC.
* Note that Spirit is a jailbreak for every device. It will NOT unlock your iPhone.
* Step 1: Download Spirit from our download page.
* Step 2: Make sure you have at least version 9 of iTunes.
* Step 3: Back up your iPhone, iTouch or iPad in iTunes, just in case something goes wrong.
* Step 4: Launch Spirit.

* Step 6: Wait just a few seconds until you see this image:

* Congrats, you just jailbroke your iPhone / iPod Touch / iPad using Spirit.
* Windows Vista or Windows 7 users may get the error c0000005.
* To avoid this error, you have to run Spirit.exe in compatibility mode. To do so:
