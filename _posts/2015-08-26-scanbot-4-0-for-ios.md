* Scanbot, a powerful document and QR code scanner for iOS which sports optical character recognition and a slew of other cool features, was bumped to version 4.0 today.
* Available on a freemium basis with optional paid upgrades, Scanbot 4.0 for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad introduces Workflows and Quick-Actions, a pair of major new features aimed at increasing your productivity by automating repeating tasks such as uploading scans to cloud services.
* “With this release we continue to deliver on our promise to build the leading mobile scanner app by combining unique technology with an outstanding user experience.” says CEO Frank Thelen.
* Workflows is the most requested feature of Scanbot users. Workflows let you automate tasks like uploading one or more documents to cloud-storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox or Box, sharing a document via email and more. The Workflow feature is available for all users and doesn’t require you to upgrade to Scanbot Premium.

* The three most actively used workflows are available beneath each document for quick one-tap functionality. The app dynamically adapts to your preferred Workflows over time so the selection of displayed Workflows is dependent on the number of times a Workflow has been used.
* Similar to iOS and OS X’s Data Detectors, Quick-Actions in Scanbot turns portions of the text detected on scanned documents into actionable items. For instance, if a restaurant receipt you scanned contains a URL, a phone number and the address, the app will extract and convert them into quick actions.

* “With one tap users can then open the restaurants homepage, call for making a reservation or navigate to the address with the maps app,” Scanbot said.
* Quick-Actions take advantage of Scanbot’s proprietary document intelligence technology. This feature is not available for all users and requires the upgrade to Scanbot Pro.
* In addition to Workflows and Quick-Actions, this edition of Scanbot includes support for the FTP protocols and Microsoft’s OneNote note-taking platform and features a revamped design to make the app even more intuitive and frictionless.
* “We literally rethought the whole experience of scanning a document, storing it in the cloud and added actions to effectively use the content.” says Scanbot’s lead designer Michael Stache.
* Scanbot has 2.5 million users in over 130 countries who collectively scan more than 700,000 documents each month, a figure poised to double by the end of this year.
* One of the most frequently used features of Scanbot is its ability to save scans to cloud-storage services. The top three most-used cloud services in Scanbot are Dropbox, Google Drive and Apple’s iCloud.

* Together, Dropbox, Google Drive and iCloud account for 98 percent of the cloud-storage selections of Scanbot’s user base.
* Developers mentioned the following highlights in release notes:
* Again, with newly added support for Microsoft’s OneNote application and the FTP protocol Scanbot users now have even more choices in terms of exporting their documents.
* Scanbot is a freemium application that anyone can download at no charge, with advanced features locked behind In-App Purchases ranging from $1.99 to $4.99.
