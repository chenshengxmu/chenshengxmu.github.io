* If you have developed a healthy habit of going to bed and getting up at regular times, ensuring that notifications and calls don’t buzz at the most inopportune time is key to good night’s sleep. Since iOS 6, iPhone and iPad have included a Do Not Disturb mode, and Macs since OS X Mountain Lion.
* When enabled, it silences all incoming calls and alerts. But did you know that Do Not Disturb can be scheduled? I set my devices to auto-enter Do Not Disturb to prevent alerts from ringing, vibrating or lighting up the screen while I’m asleep.
* In this post, we’re going to teach you how to schedule Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac to turn on and off at the same times every day, choose who to allow calls from, when you want to be disturbed and more.
* Setting a schedule for Do Not Disturb ensures that you won’t be disturbed at a certain time. Keep in mind that this feature is device-specific so you’ll need to individually set up Do Not Disturb scheduling for each of your devices.
* Even though you don’t see or hear notifications arrive in Do Not Disturb mode, your device collects them in the Notification Center where they can be viewed later.
* Step 1: Go to Settings → Do Not Disturb on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* Step 2: Flip the Scheduled button to the ON position, as shown below.

* Step 3: Now set quiet hours for Do Not Disturb mode.

* Step 4: Now choose when to be disturbed when Do Not Disturb mode is on:

* That’s it, your iOS device will not automatically enter and exit Do Not Disturb mode at the same time every day. When a device is in Do Not Disturb mode, a moon icon is shown in iOS’s status bar at the top of the screen.

* To manually turn Do Not Disturb on and off, flip the Schedule switch to the OFF position and set Manual to the ON/OFF position to enable/disable the feature.

* Or, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control Center, and then tap the crescent moon icon. Manually entering and exiting Do Not Disturb mode won’t change your set scheduling times and options.
* Step 1: Open System Preferences on your Mac.
* Step 2: Click on Notifications preferences.

* Step 4: Optionally, elect to receive call alerts even when Do Not Disturb is on:
* That’s it, from now on Do Not Disturb will pause all notifications at your custom times, each and every day. As a nice bonus, notifications on your Mac stop when the display is in sleep or when you’re projecting the screen.
* To manually enable Do Not Disturb mode, click the Notification Center icon in the menu bar and swipe down to reveal a hidden Do Not Disturb button.
* Click it to toggle Do Not Disturb on or off.

* If the Notification Center icon in your Mac’s menu bar is dimmed, as depicted by the screenshot below, you are in Do Not Disturb mode.
