* The Verizon iPhone has been announced, and if you’re one of the millions that is probably planning on buying one, you can now check your contract eligibility. Among other things, the Verizon iPhone has a new antenna. This should make call reliability much better with the iPhone on Verizon’s network.
* If you are a current Verizon wireless customer, Apple has posted a page where you can check your contract eligibility for an upgrade. Verizon also has an eligibility page for customers to check their contracts as well…

* Apple also has a page where you can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders begin.
* If you look around on Verizon’s new iPhone promotion page, there’s an interesting window that displays the iPhone capacity and colors.

* There is a white iPhone 4 included on this page. Who knows if this is legit or a mistake, but I guess we’ll find out when pre-orders start on February 3rd.
* Do you think the white iPhone will be available on Verizon?
