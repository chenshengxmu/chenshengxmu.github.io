* Is your iPhone’s keyboard getting in the way? If so, then you may want to give Pull To Dismiss a try.
* Pull To Dismiss is the latest jailbreak tweak from Ryan Petrich that allows you to easily dismiss your iPhone’s keyboard with a simple pull. It works similar to pull to refresh, except instead of refreshing the content on the page, it dismisses your keyboard…
* Pull To Dismiss is a simple tweak with no settings or options to configure. Just install it, and you can begin dismissing your keyboard with a simple pull.
* If you’re interested, you can download it for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo; it works with iOS 3.2 or higher.
