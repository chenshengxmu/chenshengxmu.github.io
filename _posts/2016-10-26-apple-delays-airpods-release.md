* Bad news for folks hoping to snag a pair of Apple’s cool new wireless AirPod headphones this month. TechCrunch has received a statement from Apple saying that they aren’t quite ready yet, so don’t expect them to hit their original ‘late October’ rollout date.
* If you’ve been waiting for Apple’s AirPod wireless headphones to go on sale, you’re going to have to wait a little longer. Apple says that they are not ready and they it will need ‘a little more time’.
* “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,” an Apple spokesperson said to TechCrunch.
* Apple would not say whether the delay was due to a hardware or software issue, and wouldn’t give a new timeline for future availability. Either way it’s a setback for a product that was a surprise at the iPhone 7 event entering the busy holiday shopping season.
