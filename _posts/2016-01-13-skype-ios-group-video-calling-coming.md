* Skype is celebrating its tenth anniversary so the Microsoft-owned company yesterday announced that users of its mobile application will soon be able to take advantage of a free group video calling feature.
* According to Gurdeep Pall, Skype CVP, group video calling on mobile devices will be coming to Skype’s iPhone and iPad app “soon,” and to Windows 10 and Android devices.
* “Since the launch of Skype video, people across the globe have enjoyed nearly 2 trillion minutes of free video calls—from soldiers attending the birth of their child, to explorers connecting with students from the top of Everest,” said Skype.
* Group video calling has been available at no charge on desktop Windows and Mac platforms and on the Xbox One gaming console since April of 2014.
* To get a sneak peek of group video calling in Skype’s mobile apps, register your interest on the official website.
* Upon providing a few details such as your email address, Skype user name, country of residence and device, Skype will set you up with group video calling on your mobile and will send you an email when it’s ready.
* “We’ll be in touch in the coming days once you’re all set up,” reads a notice on the website. Fun fact: free video calling for one-to-one conversations in Skype’s desktop application launched a decade ago.
