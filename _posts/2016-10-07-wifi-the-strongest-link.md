* No matter how many Wi-Fi networks you use on a daily basis, and no matter the purpose, a new jailbreak tweak called WiFi – The Strongest Link could help ensure you’re always using the strongest Wi-Fi signal possible.
* This tweak will constantly monitor the Wi-Fi networks around you in real time and try to keep you connected to the one with the strongest signal.
* For example, if you’re near three Wi-Fi networks: one with 50% signal, another with 25% signal, and the last with 75% signal, this tweak will automatically switch you over to the last one with 75% signal because it has the highest signal strength of the three available around you.
* In situations where you live or work in Wi-Fi congested areas, your iPhone or iPad will normally stay connected to the first network you connect to until it physically can’t anymore, and this tweak does away with that problem.
* By keeping yourself connected to the Wi-Fi networks with better signal strengths, you can load web pages more quickly, reduce power usage, and experience fewer error messages while using the internet.
* After you install WiFi – The Strongest Link, you’ll find a completely reworked Wi-Fi preferences pane under Settings → Wi-Fi:

* You’ll see the pane has been modified to show you the MAC address of all the nearby Wi-Fi networks, their security status, more detailed signal strength, and more.
* You’re also going to see a button in the navigation bar entitled “Passwds,” which takes you to your stored Wi-Fi passwords, and you’ll find more options at the bottom of the Wi-Fi settings.
* There are two sections in the settings for this tweak, one labeled General Setup and one labeled Zone Setup:

* When you go into General Setup, you can configure a network threshold that will dictate when the tweak will switch Wi-Fi networks for your convenience and you can also configure how network strength is displayed (percentage, dBm, or RSSI).
* In the Zone Setup section, you can configure zones where you often use Wi-Fi. For example, you might want to make a zone for when you’re at home and when you’re at work so you can configure the Wi-Fi networks you use the most often there. This helps speed up the network-switching process by letting the tweak know what networks you trust switching to.
* The Password section of the tweak basically shows a running list of all the secured networks and passwords you have stored. This can come in handy when you need to connect more devices and you’ve forgotten one of the passwords somewhere down the line:

* Made with love for iOS 7 and later from the same developer who brought you CameraTweak 4, WiFi – The Strongest Link can be downloaded on your jailbroken iPhone or iPad from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today for a mere $1.69.
