* Android may be winning the smartphone war right now against Apple due to the sheer number of mobile devices available using the open-sourced OS, but Google’s not content with that. It wants to take the Cupertino company and its popular iPhone head-on.
* A new report is out today claiming that engineers from Google’s recently purchased Motorola Mobility arm have begun work on what is being called the ‘X Phone,’ a sophisticated handset due next year whose sole purpose is to annihilate the competition…
* Here’s Amir Efrati reporting for The Wall Street Journal:
* “Engineers at MotorolaMSI -0.55% are hard at work on a sophisticated handset, to be released next year, that parent Google Inc.GOOG -0.88% hopes will provide more potent competition for devices like AppleInc.’s AAPL -0.44% iPhone, said people familiar with the matter.
* Seven months after being acquired by Google for $12.5 billion, Motorola is designing its marquee handset—known internally as the “X phone”—to stand apart from existing phones, though the company is running into some obstacles, these people said.
* The previously undisclosed development effort is a key facet of Google’s strategy for bolstering the miniscule market position of the cellphone pioneer, based partly on bolstering quality while reducing the quantity of Motorola products.”
* The report goes onto say that Motorola’s engineers are primarily working on two fronts: devices that will be sold by carrier partner Verizon Wireless, like the “Droid” line of smartphones, and the X phone. And there’s also said to be an “X” tablet in the works.
* Apparently this X phone has been in the works for quite a while now. But Google has run into several problems including poor supply chain management and issues with new technology, like a bendable display, causing it to rethink some of its initial plans.
* The search giant has also been fighting to maintain its complex relationships with other smartphone makers that use its Android mobile-device software, like Samsung, who might not like the idea of Google building an in-house handset to compete with them.
* And that seems to be at least part of Google’s motive — taking on the competition. The WSJ’s sources say that the X phone project is a way for Google to hedge its bet on Android, in the event that partners start using a forked version of the OS, similar to what Amazon is doing.
* There’s not much evidence yet that this is going to happen, but the threat is very real. Imagine if a company like Samsung, who is responsible for a huge chunk of Android sales, replaced Google’s Play ecosystem with its own content. Where would that leave Android?
* Get ready, the mobile landscape is about to get real interesting.
* What do you think about the idea of a Google-branded ‘X’ phone?
