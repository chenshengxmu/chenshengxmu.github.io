* Following our report a few days ago that Twitter was going to be integrated into iOS 5, tech evangelist Robert Scoble is adding that not only Twitter will be integrated into iOS 5, but it will actually be built deeply into Apple’s latest iOS.
* At this point we can only speculate what this deep integration is going to bring to iOS users: widgets, BBM-like messaging system, photo sharing? Your guess is as good as mine…
* It would be interesting to see if Facebook is part of the integration as well. I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t.
* What kind of feature would you like this Twitter integration to bring to iOS 5? Let your imagination go wild in the comments below.
