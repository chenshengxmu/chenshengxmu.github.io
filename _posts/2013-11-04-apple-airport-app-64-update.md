* In addition to Remote, Apple has posted an update for its AirPort Utility app this afternoon. The app is used to help users manage their Wi-Fi network and AirPort base stations, including Express, Extreme and Time Capsule.
* For those unfamiliar with AirPort Utility, it offers a number of administration features like the ability to change network settings and security modes. The update isn’t a big one, but it’s worth note for people who use the app…
* The lone item in today’s 1.3.3 update is ‘Adds 64-bit support.’ It’s not clear what benefit 64-bit support would add for an app like this one, but you would obviously need an A7 device to take advantage of it—iPhone 5s, iPad Air.
* It’s interesting that Apple would choose to roll out such a menial update for AirPort Utility, while major iOS 7 updates for more popular apps like iBooks or Find My Friends have yet to hit the App Store. But hey, what do I know?
* At any rate, if you’re interested, you can grab the latest version of AirPort utility in the App Store for free.
