* Like many other popular apps, Flipboard, the beloved social news magazine for the iPhone and iPad, has received a nice update today bringing out support for iOS 8‘s Share sheet extension which allows you to more conveniently collect what you love into Flipboard magazines across Apple’s ecosystem.
* Now available free of charge in the App Store, the new Flipboard 2.3.8 also includes support for the bigger screens on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* The Safari extension installs automatically when you download this version of Flipboard
* To collect articles and your own photos into magazines without opening the app, simply tap the share icon in Safari, Photos or other compatible stock or third-party app and choose Flipboard.
* Note that the extension must first be enabled by choosing More on the rightmost side in iOS’s multi-purpose Share menu. This will take you to the extensions management screen where you’ll need to flip the Flipboard switch to ON.
* If you don’t have any magazines yet, create one in Flipboard first by tapping the “+” icon on any article, image or video to begin.
* The 20.3-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad compatible with iOS 5.0 or later. Collecting articles and photos into magazines without opening the app requires iOS 8.
