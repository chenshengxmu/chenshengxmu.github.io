* Well, that’s all folks. Apple’s highly anticipated WWDC keynote has come, and gone. All announcements have been made, all new software and products have been unveiled, and now the day is coming to a close.
* A lot has happened in the last 10 hours, with a new version of Mac OS X, iOS and new Macs all making an appearance during today’s event. And we understand that it might have been difficult to keep track of it all, so we’ve put together this awesome roundup of everything important that happened today…
