* Hopefully, you are tracking the progress of the Wallpapers of the Week section. Over the past 49 weeks, we shared some of the best wallpapers we could find, on a weekly basis. Of course, there are millions of images across the internet, but we limit the selection to a per week system, showcasing the best over the past seven days.
* As we work toward our one year anniversary in a few weeks, we encourage you to continue sharing your images, either in the comment section, via twitter @jim_gresham, or email jim@idownloadblog.com…
* Not surprisingly, I follow digital artists on Twitter and frequently keep an eye on their collections. A couple weeks ago, I ran across @iSpazio, which is the Twitter account of an Italian blog. Every-now-and-then, they will post a few quality wallpapers. Below are two great summer wallpapers, perfect for the changing weather.
