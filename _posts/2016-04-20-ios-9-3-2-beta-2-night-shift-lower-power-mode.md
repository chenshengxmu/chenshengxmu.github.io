* The ability to use iOS 9.3’s headlining Night Shift feature when an iPhone is in Low Power Mode has been reinstated in a second beta of iOS 9.3.2 that was seeded to Apple’s registered developers this morning, as noted by eagle-eyed users on Twitter and first reported on by MacRumors.
* Night Shift and Low Power Mode worked simultaneously on prior iOS 9.3 betas, but that feature was later removed without explanation in iOS 9.3 beta 4.
* “With iOS 9.3.2 beta 2, you can turn on Low Power Mode when Night Shift is on,” reports MacRumors. You can also ask Siri to enable Low Power Mode when an iPhone running iOS 9.3.2 beta 2 is in Low Power Mode though it seems that a Siri backend hasn’t been updated yet because you must enable Night Shift before asking Siri to turn on Low Power Mode.
* On the current iOS 9.3.1 software, venturing to Settings → Display & Brightness → Night Shift when an iPhone is in Low Power Mode will treat you to a greyed-out switch an a message saying that “Night Shift is disabled in Low Power Mode”.

* It’s unclear whether the ability for Night Shift to be used when Low Power Mode is active will make it into a public release of iOS 9.3.2. Of course, you can also use Control Center’s Night Shift toggle to enable that feature when an iPhone running the latest beta is in Low Power Mode.
