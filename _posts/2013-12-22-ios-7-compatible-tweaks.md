* Ok, now that you’ve jailbroken your iOS device running iOS 7 with evasi0n7, what do you do? Which tweaks work and which ones don’t? This is one of the most frequently asked questions we’ve received this morning, so we figured we’d better start making a list.
* Most tweaks that rely on Mobile Substrate aren’t working, as it’s currently broken, but there are a few that seem to be ok. Below you’ll find all of the iOS 7 compatible jailbreak tweaks that we’re aware of, broken down into those working, and those ‘sort of’ working…
* Note: this is a crowdsourced list based on what commenters and readers have told us. This list is also heavily based on the work of Team-Sync iPhone Dev Team. We’ve only managed to test a handful of these ourselves thus far, on just a few device configurations. So your mileage may vary. This early in the game, it’s possible that your device model/iOS version could play a factor in whether or not a tweak is compatible. Also note that most tweaks will not run properly on A7 devices, although they may run well on older devices.
* We’re going to try and keep up with this list throughout the day, adding and removing tweaks as we learn more. And then obviously over the coming weeks and months, we’ll be announcing all iOS 7 updates for major tweaks. So be sure that you keep checking back.
* And if you haven’t jailbroken already, you can find evasi0n7 on our Downloads page. Those needing help with the process, can refer to our our evasi0n tutorial for Mac and our evasi0n tutorial for Windows, and our answers to the most frequently asked questions.
* Also, if you find a particular tweak to work or not work on iOS 7, tell us about it in the comments below!
