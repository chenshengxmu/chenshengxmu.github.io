* Apple already has nine television shows in the works that we know about and now rumor has it that they’ve picked up yet another original project, created by “Silicon Valley” star Kumail Nanjiani and his partner Emily V. Gordon.
* According to a report Thursday from Deadline, Lee Eisenberg, who produced Showtime’s breakout hit comedy series “SMILF,” will serve as showrunner.
* Eisenberg will help write the script with Godron and Najiani.
* Aptly titled “Little America,” it’s reportedly based on several true stories published by Epic Magazine. The project is a “a small, collective portrait of America’s immigrants—and thereby a portrait of America itself,” reads Deadline’s description of “Little America.”
* It’s being developed for straight-to-series consideration.
* “The TV series will go beyond the headlines to look at the funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring and unexpected lives of immigrants in America, at a time when their stories are more relevant than ever,” reads the Deadline story.
* Oscar-nominated Nanjiani and Yang, who will likely tap into their families’ immigrant experiences for this project, executive produce alongside Eisenberg and Gordon. Both Nanjiani and Gordon wrote 2017’s popular indie flick “The Big Sick.”
* Nanjiani is a Pakistani-American stand-up comedian, actor, writer and podcast host so his involvement in the project that’s focused on lives of American immigrants can only be described as fitting. You most certainly remember Nanjiani’s outstanding portrayal of dry-witted software engineer Dinesh in HBO’s Emmy Award-nominated series “Silicon Valley.”
* On a related note, Bryan Fuller and Hart Hanson have left Apple’s upcoming reboot of Steven Spielberg’s 1980s sci-fi TV anthology series “Amazing Stories” over creative differences.
