* Hot on the heels of saurik’s Cydia update, TaiG has updated its jailbreak tool to include the latest version of Cydia and to remove the setreuid patch. The update, which comes in at version 2.3, can be used by those of you who aren’t currently jailbroken. If you are jailbroken, then you’ll be able to update to the latest version of the TaiG untether via Cydia.
