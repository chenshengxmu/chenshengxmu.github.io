title: ayecon WinterBoard theme released on Cydia
---
* ayecon, the highly anticipated WinterBoard theme from popular iOS theme designer, Surenix, just made its debut on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. To take advantage of the theme, you must have a Retina enabled iPhone or iPod touch, and be running iOS 5 or above.
* As you no doubt noticed in our hands-on walkthrough, ayecon is a stunner in the looks department. Although I think our video does a good job at displaying the crazy amount of detail possessed by ayecon, it really needs to be witnessed in person to be totally appreciated.
* I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not nearly as into theming my iPhone as I used to be, but ayecon has helped rekindle my interest somewhat. You can purchase it now for $2.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let us know what you think about it in the comments.
