* Visits from Mac computers identified as running macOS 10.13 have been increasing across iDownloadBlog and various other publications in recent weeks. And now, what looks to be the first public sign of macOS 10.13 has been spotted on Mac App Store, as per Pike’s Universum which provided reliable information in the past. Apple will preview the next major versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS at its annual developers conference which kicks off with a keynote on June 5.
* According to Pike’s Universum, a portion of the Mac App Store’s Catalog URL contains a secure HTTPS link originating from Apple’s servers:
* https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.13seed.merged-1.sucatalog.gz
* The existence of this URL on Mac App Store and its format suggest that Apple is working hard to finish a developer-only preview of the successor to macOS Sierra ahead of its official introduction at WWDC 2017.

* By Apple’s standards, macOS Sierra 10.12 was a modest upgrade.
* Aside from Siri for Mac, the operating system brought out a bunch of minor improvements such as Auto Unlock, Universal Clipboard, Desktop & Documents sync, notification and keyboard enhancements and more.
