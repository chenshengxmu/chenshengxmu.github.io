title: iPhone 4 Shipping Times Extended to 1-3 Days, Product Refresh Imminent [Updated]

* Apple has extended shipping estimates for nearly all of its products on its online store, including the iPhone 4. Many of Apple’s products would usually ship within 24 hours, but estimates have been moved to a longer timeframe across the board.
* The changes are visible in the US and European Apple stores, though shipping estimate changes were initially discovered in the European channel last night…
* MacRumors provides a list of the effected products:
* – iPhone 4: 1-3 business days – iPad 2: 2-3 weeks – iPod touch: 3-5 days (8 GB and 32 GB), 1-3 days (64 GB) – iPod nano: 3-5 days – iPod shuffle: 1-2 weeks – iPod classic: 1-3 days – Apple TV: 3-5 days
* – MacBook Air: 3-5 days – MacBook Pro: 3-5 days for all models except low-end 13-inch, which remains at 24 hours – iMac: 3-5 days – Mac Pro: 3-5 days for all models except 12-core, which is at 2-4 days
* Normally, a move like this would indicate that Apple is depleting its inventory for new products to fill. While that’s still most likely the case for the iPhone 4, it doesn’t explain why other products would see extensions after being just recently refreshed.
* The same iPhone 4 shipping estimate applies to the iPhone 3GS as well, reports AppleInsider.
* A report this morning from sources overseas claims that Apple is already making an upwards for 150,000 iPhone 5 units per day. An Apple announcement is expected to take place in the coming weeks.
* UPDATE: That was weird. It appears that shipping times have been updated with normal estimates already.
