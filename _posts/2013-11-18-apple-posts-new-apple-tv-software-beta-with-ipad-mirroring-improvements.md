* Apple has just released the first beta of what would become the major iOS 7.1 software update containing a bunch of fixes and tweaks, including the updated Yahoo logo, performance improvements, a new HDR Auto feature in the Camera app and more. To go along with the software, the Cupertino company also posted an accompanying Apple TV beta software which contains an interesting iPad content mirroring feature. Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* As evidenced by the above screenshot courtesy of Cult of Mac, the beta software is available now for the second and third-generation Apple TV boxes.
* The installation guide notes that the new Apple TV Software beta “enables users to mirror content of an iPad to an Apple TV using AirPlay,” but stops short of providing the specifics other than mentioning that the update is meant to test the latest AirPlay functionality with iOS apps and websites.
* As per usual, Apple’s beta software is only available for download to registered iOS developers through the Dev Center.
* I’ll update the article if/when I learn more.
* In the meantime, feel free to share your findings down in the comments or shoot us an email at tips@idownloadblog.com.
