* In macOS Mojave, Apple is bringing four iOS apps to Mac for the first time, including News, Home, Voice Memos, and Stocks. The last of these allows you to check the financial markets and also learn more about your favorite companies. Here’s a brief look at how you use the new Stocks up in macOS Mojave.
* Apple’s native Stocks app goes all the way back to iPhone OS 1 which launched on the first iPhone in 2007. Until the introduction of iOS 12 and macOS Mojave, however, the Stocks app wasn’t available on iPad or Mac, respectively. Along with bringing the app to different devices and platforms this year, Apple also changed the app’s design and added new features.
* As Apple executive Susan Prescott noted during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this month:
* We’ve completely rebuilt the Stocks app and it has a beautiful new design. Of course, you can still see the stock prices and the changes at a glance. But we’ve added spark lines — those little charts — that show the stock performance throughout the day.
* By default, the Stocks app is found on the Mac Dock in macOS Mojave.
* 1) Click on the Stocks app icon to get started.
* 2) On the left side of the app, you’ll notice a listing of the exchanges and stocks you were already following on the Stocks app on iPhone. If you’re new to the Stocks app, you’ll find the default list, which features the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and APPL stock.
* At the top right, notice the selection, Top Stories From Apple News.

* 3) To add or remove stocks from this list, click on the Menu button in the bottom right corner of that column.
* 4) From this Manage Watchlist screen, you can add and remove systems with ease. To add a symbol, go File > Add Symbol from the Mac toolbar.
* 5) Tap the delete button next to the stock you want to remove. It’s the red circle with the minus symbol in it.

* 6) Click Done when you’re finished adding and eliminating symbols.
* This will take you back to the main Stocks app screen.
* 1) Click on Top Stories From Apple News on the top left. On the right side of the screen, you’ll see current news headlines from the world of business. Some of these stories will relate to the stocks you have listed on the left side of the screen.
