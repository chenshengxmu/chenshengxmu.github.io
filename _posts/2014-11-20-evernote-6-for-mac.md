* Evernote, the popular note-taking and productivity platform, on Thursday issued a major refresh to its Mac app while adding a new Work Chat for sharing and collaborating to the iPhone and iPad client, among other items.
* After a complete rewrite, Evernote 6.0 for Mac is now significantly faster, more reliable and consumes less energy than ever before.
* As if that weren’t enough, the new Mac app comes with half a dozen new features, including sleek new look optimized for OS X Yosemite, search improvements, the ability to resize images and tables, to mention just a few.
* iOS and OS X editions of Evernote are available free of charge.
* The new Work Chat in Evernote for iOS gives you finely graded controls to share content, edit permission when sharing a single note, see what collaborators are editing in your account and start chats with individual users or company groups.
* Evernote 7.6.2 for iOS changelog
* In addition to three times faster syncing, Yosemite look, Spotlight searching of your notes and new sharing features, Evernote 6.0 for Mac includes a revamped Presentation Mode with “beautifully styled tables” and bleeding images.
* You’ll love a new Context feature for Premium users, too (starts at $4.99 per month).
* As the name suggest, Context automatically displays notes, articles and people related to what you’re working. Related articles are pulled from The Wall Street Journal and other sources and related people from LinkedIn and your business.
* Oh, and they’ve squashed more than an incredible 500 various bugs that contributed to more than 200 types of crashes.
* Evernote 6.0 for Mac changelog
* Download Evernote for Mac, the iPhone and iPad at no cost in the App Store.
