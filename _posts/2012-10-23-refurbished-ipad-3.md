* You have to feel bad for anyone who unknowingly purchased a third generation iPad within the last month (assuming they can’t return it). Because after only 30 days, that tablet has become obsolete.
* The slate is being phased out by its younger, cooler, but same-sized sibling that is the fourth-generation iPad. Apple announced the new tablet at its media event this morning, alongside the also-new iPad mini…
* What’s the difference between the two? Well aside from the noticeable change from the old 30-pin dock connector to the Lightning plug, Apple has also given the tablet a speed bump with a new A6X processor (versus the A5X) and has expanded its LTE to Sprint and other carriers. The FaceTime camera has also been updated to HD.
* It’s odd that Apple has decided to release such an update halfway through the iPad’s typical year-long life cycle, but there does seem to be a bit of silver lining here. As noted by The Verge, the Cupertino company is now offering refurbished third generation tablets for as low $379. That’s just $50 more than than the iPad mini.
* Refurbished products from Apple are actually very top-notch. They are put through the same testing as new products, come with the same one-year warranty, and the iPads generally come with a new back and battery.
* With the holidays around the corner, we expect these to sell out extremely quickly. So if you’ve had your eye on an iPad for a while, and weren’t impressed with today’s announcements, you might want to look into this.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
