* Yahoo’s beleaguered Mail has long given up its leadership position to Gmail although many people would agree that Yahoo’s web-mail service is far more elegant, sophisticated and streamlined compared to Google’s Gmail, which often times looks very much like work in progress. Taking another crack at dethroning Google, Yahoo today started rolling out a significant Mail makeover across the web, mobile and desktop.
* Further sweetening the deal, the company has raised the storage cap so everyone now gets one terabyte of free storage. The new design looks absolutely gorgeous, jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* In a nutshell, the new Yahoo Mail lets you (finally!) view messages as conversations and features an updated calendar feature along with a bunch of user interface themes. As you can see on the screenshots I’ve included in the post, the designs are just beautiful and users also get to choose from curated Flickr photos to personalize their inbox.

* I’m loving the promo vid Yahoo put together, have a look below.
* The web interface also looks stunning.

* Yahoo explains in a blog post that the experience is snappier than it’s ever been. Common activities like searching, starring and deleting are now available on the web via one-click actions that appear when you hover over an email.
* “We also wanted to give you more breathing room in your inbox, so you can collapse the left-hand toolbar to be more productive,” the post reads. Another nice touch: choosing a background photo theme in one place applies it across all your devices.

* As a bonus, many features previously reserved for premium Mail Plus customers are now free, including disposable email addresses, enhanced filters and automatic message forwarding.
* The biggest news has got to be “a monstrous” one terabyte of storage for your email messages and attachments. By comparison, Google gives each Gmail user just fifteen gigabytes of storage shared between Google Drive, Gmail and Google+ Photos.
* By the way, both themes and conversations are of course also available on iOS and Android (you can disable threaded view in the app’s Settings).
* Download the new Yahoo! Mail from the App Store.
* The new experience is available in English in the US, Canada, UK, Philippines, Malaysia, India, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa, with more countries and languages coming soon.
* Don’t panic if the updated build is not yet available on your local App Store as these things take some time to propagate.
* By the way, today is Yahoo Mail’s sweet 16.
