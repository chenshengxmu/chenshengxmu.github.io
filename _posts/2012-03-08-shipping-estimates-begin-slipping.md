* Yesterday, Apple announced its new iPad and Apple TV at a media event in California. Later that afternoon, both products went up for pre-order on Apple’s Online Store. Apple said at the time both products would begin shipping to customers on March 16th. However, due to the excitement over both products, shipping times for both the Apple TV and iPad have slipped, as noted by 9to5mac.
* Some models of the iPad have slipped back to March 19th, while the Apple TV has slipped back even further — now delivering in roughly “1 -2 weeks” for customers that are just pre-ordering…
* The white 16GB and 64GB AT&T LTE models of the new iPad now have a delivery date of March 19, while all other models of the iPad remain at March 16th. However, we expect Apple’s supplies to continue slipping as more people begin pre-ordering Apple’s latest tablet.

* On the iPad’s launch day, you might get lucky by grabbing the few iPads Apple Stores have to sell, that haven’t been pre-ordered by customers. If shipping times get so rough here in the next few days, this might be your best option.
* So what’s so special about the new iPad? Announced by Tim Cook on stage yesterday, the new iPad features an all new Retina display, dual-core A5X processor with quad-core graphics, upgraded cameras, larger battery, LTE and more RAM. As for the new Apple TV, it’s still priced at $99, featuring 1080p playback and an updated UI.
* Worldwide, shipping times for the iPad are also beginning to slip. The iPad is completely sold out in Germany’s online store and shipping times have moved to March 22nd.
* As the excitement for the new iPad continues, we expect Apple to continue running out of supplies, like they did with the iPhone 4S. If you got your pre-order in yesterday, you should be good for receiving the new products on March 16th.
* Have you pre-ordered the new iPad  yet?
