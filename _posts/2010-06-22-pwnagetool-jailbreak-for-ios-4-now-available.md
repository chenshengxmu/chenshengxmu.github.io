* Now there are a lot of information to digest. PwnageTool will not work with all firmwares for every device. There are many restriction.
* I invite you to carefully read this information provided by the Dev Team. Read it over and over again and see if PwnageTool will work for you or not.
* Each supported device has few different scenarios that users need to consider when performing the upgrades, you need to check below and perform the upgrade in the particular way that matches your current device state.
* NB: With PwnageTool 4.0 certain devices are not supported this is because they are not supported in iOS 4.0 or they are not supported by our software.  We’re working on ways to get past these restrictions.
* iPhone 3GS
* Summary: Currently, PwnageTool only works on previously jailbroken 3GS devices with the old bootrom.
* iPhone 3G
* IMPORTANT! Whenever you need to enter DFU mode, you will need to do so using PwnageTool.
* iPod touch 2G
* Baseband Unlock
* Let me remind you that if you have an iPhone 3G, you can jailbreak using RedSn0w.
* If you have any question, please feel free to leave a comment.
