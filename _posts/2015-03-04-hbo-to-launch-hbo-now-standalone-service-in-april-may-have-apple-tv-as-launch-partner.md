* HBO is looking to hop onto the Internet TV craze with the launch of a standalone service called “HBO Now” in April, according to the International Business Times.
* The publication reports HBO is looking to charge $15 per month for the service, which would offer HBO content like “Game of Thrones” and “Boardwalk Empire”. It would be the first time customers will be able to access HBO without having to go through a cable or satellite provider.
* There’s word Apple might be in the mix with the launch of HBO Now. IB Times reports HBO has been in talks with Apple to make the Apple TV one of the launch partners for the “HBO Now” service. “Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say.”
* Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers. If a deal between Apple and HBO was struck, users would presumably be able to access HBO Now through a standalone app.
* Major League Baseball Advanced Media is building the back-end for the HBO Now service and is looking to launch the new service by April 12 for the debut of the new season of “Game of Thrones”.
