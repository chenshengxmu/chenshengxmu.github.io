* Starbucks, a Seattle-based global coffee company and coffeehouse chain and Apple’s longtime marketing partner, started offering ‘Pick of the Week’ promotion via its recently Passbook-enabled App Store app back in 2011. The tie-in allows Starbucks customers to download paid iOS applications for free as they sip on their beverage of choice.
* The company has now upgraded its backend system to allow folks to scan these redemption codes using their iPhone’s iSight camera, a feature Apple added to iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices as part of its iOS 7 software release in September 2013…
* As reported by Sarah Guarino of 9to5Mac, instead of manually typing the promo code on the back of a physical Starbucks card, customers can now just point their iPhone’s camera at the code. A moment later, iOS 7 recognizes the code and automatically starts downloading your free app.

* Apple first added the ability to scan and redeem promo codes on printed  iTunes Gift Cards using the Macs’s built-in iSight camera with the release of iTunes 11 back in November 2012.
* A year later, the same feature was brought to iOS devices via the iOS 7 software update.
* Starbucks’ Pick of the Week digital promotion was launched more than two years ago to entice users of Apple devices to have their lattes at Starbucks location by giving away a different paid iOS app or other piece of iTunes media each week.
* Apple also allows its registered developers to scan and recognize barcodes with the iSight camera by way of new iOS 7 APIs. A Cydia tweak for jailbroken devices, NativeQR, lets you scan QR codes directly from the stock Camera app.
