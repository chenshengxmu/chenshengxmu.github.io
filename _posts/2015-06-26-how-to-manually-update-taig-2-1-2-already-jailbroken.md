* If you’re already jailbroken, and let’s face it, a lot of you are, then you may be wondering how to update your jailbreak to the latest version of TaiG—version 2.1.2. Should you start from scratch, or try to use the TaiG jailbreak tool again? No.
* That’s because it’s super easy to update to the latest version of TaiG directly from Cydia itself. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to get up and running on the latest version of TaiG, which fixes all sorts of bugs, in just a few minutes.
* You can now do this without adding any third-party repos. TaiG 2.1.2 has been added to Cydia’s default repos! Just refresh Cydia and you should see it. Also, some of you have raised concern about this original tutorial suggesting the use of a “pirate” repo. That repo is actually the very same repo that comes bundled with every TaiG jailbreak, so why we certainly don’t condone piracy, this was a way to provide you with the update as quickly as possible. Since the package is now on stock Cydia, there is no reason to use this repo.
* Step 1: Open Cydia
* Step 2: Tap Sources
* Step 3: Tap Edit
* Step 4: Tap Add
* Step 5: Type the following source URL: http://apt.3kzhushou.com
* Step 6: Tap Add Source
* Step 7: After the source is added, tap Return to Cydia
* Step 8: You should be prompted to upgrade, select Complete Upgrade. If you aren’t prompted, open the Changes tab and tap on the TaiG Untether, Tap Modify, and Tap Upgrade
* Step 9: Once the Upgrade is completed, you will be prompted to reboot and the TaiG 2.1.2 upgrade will be installed
* That’s all there is to it. You can now enjoy all of the benefits of TaiG 2.1.2, including its Cydia Substrate support, fixes for missing icons, and more.
