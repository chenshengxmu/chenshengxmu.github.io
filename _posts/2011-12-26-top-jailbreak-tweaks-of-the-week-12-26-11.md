* Welcome to our tweaks of the week. Last week you probably saw that the iPhone Dev Team released an unlock for iOS 5.0.1. That was perhaps the biggest news warranting a video, along with the Home button recalibration trick that seemed to be massively popular amongst viewers and readers.
* As usual, please make sure to spread our iPhone, iPad, and iOS video instruction by sharing our posts on Twitter and Facebook.
