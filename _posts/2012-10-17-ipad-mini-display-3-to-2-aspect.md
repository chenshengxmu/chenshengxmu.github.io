* A pair of OEM leaks thought to depict the same display appear to strongly suggests that, despite the skinnier side bezels and a smaller form-factor, the iPad mini might still incorporate the display which has an aspect ratio of 4:3, just like prior iPads and iPhones (except for the iPhone 5, of course).
* This means videos played on the smaller iPad will continue to be letterboxed, at least until an iPad mini with a taller display arrives (you heard that here first!). I guess Apple had to save something for future iterations. Also leaked today: another image of a battery said to belong to the iPad mini, with the label rating it at 16.7Whr and 3.72V…
* Smartphone parts supplier ETrade Supply (via MacRumors) published below photos of the iPad mini display. It’s allegedly made by LG Display and measures almost eight inches diagonally, or “about 162mm in length and 124mm in width”.
* Previous rumors painted the iPad mini as having a 7.85-inch display.

* Of note, this screen has an aspect ratio of 4:3, though the publication previously saw OEM display parts with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Codes on the back indicate that LG Display is supplying screens for the iPad mini, per rumors.

* Text on the ribbon cable extending from the display is also consistent with labeling on genuine Apple parts, the publication notes. And the following image published by the French blog NowhereElse is said to represent the iPad mini display in quality testing.

* We first heard of the iPad mini battery last week when a pair of claimed photos showed off a battery carrying a model number of A1445 and an Apple part number of 616-0641. It was also rated at 3.72 volts, offering 16.7 Whr of energy on 4490 mAh of charge.
* For comparison’s sake, the battery inside the iPhone 5 comes in at 1,440 mAh with a 5.46 Whr capacity. The one in the iPad 3 is rated at 11,666 mAh and 42.5 Whr and the iPad 2 battery is 25 Whr.
