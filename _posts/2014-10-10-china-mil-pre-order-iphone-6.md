* Pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus officially began in China today, and it sounds like sales for the two handsets are doing well thus far. Tencent reports that the country’s three major wireless carriers recorded more than 1 million pre-orders during first 6 hours of availability.
* There’s been no word on what sales looked like throughout the rest of the day, and the 1M figure doesn’t include orders taken directly by Apple, or its 6,000 authorized resellers. It also doesn’t account for the 9+ million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus reservations that were made last week.
* The new iPhones will launch in China on October 17. Both will support TD-LTE and FDD-LTE, and be offered by China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom across the country. The first two carriers are among the world’s largest, with 800M and 300M subscribers, respectively.
* Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus at an event on September 9, and launched them in several countries 10 days later. After opening weekend, the company announced that it had sold 10 million handsets during the 3-day period, besting its previous record for handset sales.
