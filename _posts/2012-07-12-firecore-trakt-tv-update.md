* FireCore has released a significant update today for its aTV Flash (black) software. The suite allows jailbroken Apple TV users to playback different file types, surf the web, and much more.
* With version 1.7, FireCore has added a number of new features and enhancements to the list, including trakt.tv integration and a new Ratings system. Keep reading for the full change log…
* For those who aren’t familiar with trakt.tv, it’s essentially a (free) service that automatically tracks the movies and TV shows you watch, and then provides you with recommendations based on the recorded data.
* Other changes include:
* As always, the update is available for free to current aTV Flash (black) owners. Otherwise, new users can purchase the software for $29.99 from FireCore’s website.
* If you’re looking for more information regarding jailbreaking the Apple TV, we have a list of all the benefits of jailbreaking, as well as a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it.
* Unfortunately, all this only applies to ATV 2 owners, as the ATV 3 is still yet to be hacked.
