* If you use the Export to PDF function on your Mac a lot, then why not save yourself some hassle and set up a keyboard shortcut for doing it? It’ll make life a lot easier for PDF power users, and in this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can it.
* You can set up an Export to PDF keyboard shortcut in just about any app on your Mac. To do that, follow the steps provided below:
* 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac.
* 2) Open the Keyboard preferences pane.

* 5) Click on the + button just below the list of shortcuts.
* 6) Choose the application you want to use the shortcut in, or use the All Applications option to use the shortcut in any app.

* 7) Here’s where things get a little tricky, so pay attention:
* Open the app you’re making a shortcut for and visit the File menu in the Menu Bar. If you see Export to PDF… then follow scenario 1 below. If you see Export to → PDF…, then follow scenario 2 instead.
* Scenario 1: In the keyboard preferences you opened in step 6, enter “Export as PDF…” in the Menu Title text field. This works for a number of system apps like Mail, Notes, and Safari.
* Scenario 2: In the keyboard preferences you opened in step 6, enter “PDF…” in the Menu Title text field. This is necessary for iWork apps, like Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and other non-stock apps.
* Note: If you see anything other than “Export to PDF…” or “Export to → PDF…” in the menu, then you will use the lowest level of the menu command. It’s unlikely your results will vary, but if you see something different drop us a comment below.
* 8) Choose a keyboard shortcut by selecting the Keyboard Shortcut text field and pressing the keys you want to use. We recommend Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + P.
* 9) Click on the blue Add button to save your changes.
* Now you’ve successfully added the Export to PDF keyboard shortcut to your Mac. When you attempt to use it in another app, such as on a web page in Safari, this should happen:

* When you click on the blue Save button, that should save a PDF file to your chosen output folder:

* And that’s all there is to it!
* With the Export to PDF command ported over to a simple keyboard shortcut, you no longer have to go looking for it from the Menu Bar. While it doesn’t work in every app, it works in a lot of them and should make life a lot easier for those of you that are PDF fanatics.
