title: Spice Up Your iPhone Background Image With Video Wallpapers
---
* There is a new mod in town. Its name is vWallpaper and it’s an awesome jailbreak app that will bring video wallpaper to your iPhone homescreen. Redmond Pie has a video of it in action and I have to admit it’s pretty impressive.
* vWallpaper comes pre-loaded with a few video wallpapers but you can also download some new ones from within the application. Really neat!
* To install vWallpaper, you first have to add this source to Cydia: http://i.danstaface.net/deb. Then simply search for vWallpaper and download the app.
* I have two concerns about this mod though. First, is the fact that it might slow down your iPhone performances, especially on older models like the iPhone 3G. Second, adding a video wallpaper to your iPhone might be pretty intense on the battery and will most likely drain it faster.
* Make sure to share your first impressions with us if you download vWallpaper.
