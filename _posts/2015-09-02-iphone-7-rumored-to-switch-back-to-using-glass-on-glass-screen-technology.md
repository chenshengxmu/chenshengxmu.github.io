* Unhappy with the in-cell screen process used in production of iPhone displays which is plagued with lower touch sensitivity on screen edges, Apple is reportedly considering a return to glass-on-glass (G/G) touchscreen panels for an ‘iPhone 7,’ a technology it ditched with the release of the iPhone 5 in the fall of 2012.
* According to a somewhat sketchy report published Wednesday by DigiTimes, Apple is currently sampling glass-on-glass touch samples for 2016 iPhones.
* If true, the iPhone 7—or whatever a 2016 iPhone ends up being named—will feature better touch accuracy, improved Multi-Touch performance and better touch detection on screen edges. In addition, glass-on-glass technology would permit the company to develop a bezel-free iPhone and support 4K resolutions.
* “In-cell touch panels also make it difficult for vendors to pursue higher resolutions including Ultra HD (4K) due to current bottlenecks,” DigiTimes said.
* Touch panel makers have reportedly begun sending samples of fully laminated G/G technology to Apple and Corning. Apple supplier Asahi Glass has also reportedly sent glass samples. The Cupertino firm will use in-cell technology for the iPhones released in 2015.
* Today’s report reaffirms recent findings by DigiTimes Research, based on supply chain data and market observers, that concluded a switch to G/G technology would theoretically allow for an iPhone with an ultra-sharp screen and nearly bezel-less appearance.
* “While it is still not 100 percent clear what Apple will decide, the company has been impressed with the AMOLED display and G/G touch panel sensitivity and features found in the Apple Watch,” reads the analysis.
* Some of the benefits of using glass-on-glass touchscreens include the following perks:
* In general, capacitive touch technology that Apple’s implementation of Multi-Touch depends on can be either glass- or film-substrate produced. iPhones prior to the iPhone 5 used used glass-substrate capacitive touchscreens that form the X-axis sensing electrode on the upper surface of a glass substrate and Y-axis sensing electrode on the bottom.
* Starting with the iPhone 5 in 2012, iPhones switched to in-cell technology which eliminates a layer by building the capacitors inside the LCD assembly itself, which allows for a notably thinner appearance of the screen and sharper images that appear as if painted on the surface of the glass.
