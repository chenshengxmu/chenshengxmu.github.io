* It seems like every day tiny bits of information trickle out concerning the Verizon iPhone 4. Now it looks like we’re finally getting somewhere, with full pricing information managing to leak out today.
* Here is a full breakdown of the iPhone 4’s pricing structure on the Verizon network. Unsurprisingly, it closely resembles the prices found on AT&T…
* This morning, Apple inadvertently posted the Verizon iPhone’s details and made it available for order, only to realize their mistake and take it down.
* Here is a breakdown of that information, coupled with what else we’ve been finding out since the Verizon iPhone was announced.

* Initially there will be two models, both black, in 16GB (Model MC676LL/A) and 32GB (Model MC678LL/A) models. These iPhones will be priced at $199.99 for 16GB and $299.99 for 32GB with a new 2-year contract agreement.
* Purchasing your iPhone 4 at full retail price is pricey, but may be the route you want to take in order to avoid being locked into a 2-year agreement. They will be available at full price at $649.99 for the 16GB model, and $749.99 for the 32GB model.
* The individual plans will consist of 450 minutes for $39.99 monthly, 900 minutes for $59.99 a month with unlimited calling for up to 5 people, and $69.99 for outright unlimited calling.
* Family SharePlans start at $69.99 for 700 minutes, with 1400 minutes, 2000 minutes and unlimited available for $89.99, $99.99, and $119.99 respectively.
* A data package is of course required, but the good news is that the data is unlimited, at least initially. That will set you back $29.99.
* You can also use the personal hotspot feature for an extra $20 a month for 2GB of pooled data. Each extra GB of data costs an additional $20.
* As far as SMS messaging goes, there will be a 250, 500, and unlimited allotment coming in at $5, $10, and $20 respectively.
* So, what does all of this mean to you, the consumer? Well it means that any hopes that Verizon’s acquisition of the iPhone 4 would make prices more competitive, seems to have gone out the window.
* If anything, Verizon’s iPhone 4 is the more expensive option when you figure in lack of rollover minutes, differences in texting plans, etc.
* That’s $299.99 for a 32GB iPhone 4, $69.99 for unlimited calling, $29.99 for unlimited data, $20 for 2GB’s of monthly hotspot, and $20 for unlimited texting. That equals out to be about $139.98 before taxes for monthly charges.
* Add in the price of the phone, and your first month’s bill is looking to be around $439.97 before any taxes, activation fees, etc.
* And don’t forget the price of cases, charges, and screen protectors, and plenty of apps!
* Who’s ready for some iPhone 4 on Verizon goodness?
