* Good news for Mac users who have been unable to jailbreak due to the lack of a native Mac jailbreak tool for iOS 8.x: The Pangu team has heard your cries, and is gearing up for an OS X release.
* In a Twitter post just a few minutes ago, the PanguTeam Twitter account acknowledged the release of Cydia 1.1.16, and followed that acknowledgement up with some insight on the status of the Mac jailbreak. Have a look at the details inside…
* Also we are already working on Mac version. It may come out in couple of days. Pls wait a bit more time.

* The team states that they are already working on a Mac version of their popular tool, and that a release is very close, perhaps only two days away. It’s bittersweet news in light of the recent iOS 8.1.1 beta release. As we reported, iOS 8.1.1 kills the iOS 8 jailbreak, and it’s only a matter of time before Apple releases the iOS 8.1.1 firmware and stops signing iOS 8.1.
* Lets hope that Pangu can make good on their release window, and that plenty of Mac users who have thus far been unable to jailbreak are able to do so. Again, if you’ve yet to update to iOS 8.1, now is the time to do so to ensure that you’ll be able to jailbreak when the time comes.
* Are you happy that a Mac version of Pangu8 is imminent?
