* The refreshed MacBook Pro models for 2018 are here so we tasked our video guy Harris Craycraft with putting together an unboxing video taking a look at what’s inside packaging.
* Harris picked up the baseline $2,799 15-inch MacBook Pro model with 32GB 2400MHz RAM and 512 GB of flash storage and upgraded it via Apple’s online store to a faster 2.9 GHz six-core Core i9 processor from Intel (an extra $300).
* For those wondering, the fully maxed-out MacBook Pro configuration is a $6,669 value.
