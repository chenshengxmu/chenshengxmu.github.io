* Yep, that’s a picture of a live football match running on my Apple TV 2. Interested in the ability to watch live sports, stream movies from Amazon VOD and Hulu? Then you’ve come to the right place.
* In our third and final tutorial in our Apple TV jailbreak series, we show you how to cut the cable cord completely, and gain access to all sorts of streaming goodies, courtesy of that tiny black miracle box.
* If you’ve already taken the steps to jailbreak your Apple TV with Seas0nPass, and install aTV Flash (black), then check inside for the final piece of the puzzle — installing XBMC and streaming content from a PlayOn instance running from your Mac or PC…
* Understandably, that sounds a bit complicated in writing, but watching the video shows how ridiculously easy it really is.
* For those of you looking for ways to maintain some for of entertainment while eliminating expensive cable of satellite bills, this may be just what you need. I know that I’ve recently “cut the cord” and I’m fairly satisfied with the offerings here.
* Granted, this isn’t a 100% free solution, but you get what you put into it. The jailbreak is of course, free; aTV Flash (black) will set you back a one-time fee of $19.95, and PlayOn costs either a monthly or one-time fee, depending on you. Couple that in with Netflix and/or Amazon Prime subscriptions, and you’re possibly looking at $20 bucks a month or so.
* Still, that’s a lot cheaper than the $100 a month cable was requiring of me, and I can cancel any of these services with no hassle.
* For cable cutters, the Apple TV 2 will only become more desirable as more features are added by the jailbreak community.
* What do you think? Is this enough to get you to consider cutting cable? Or does it still leave a lot to be desired?
