* The prolific mobile games publisher based out in France, Gameloft, on Thursday released a Candy Crush Saga-esque game that challenges you to break everything in your path and use power-ups to reach the top.
* “Get wild in the jungle by breaking everything in sight with the help of some fun and frenzied monster pals,” teases Gameloft.
* Called Candy Block Breaker and available free from the App Store for the iPhone and iPad, the addictive breaker game is basically a reworked version of Gameloft’s Candy Block Breaker which was published last June and came integrated with the popular messaging app, Tango…
* As the title suggests, Candy Block Breaker features crisp and colorful Retina graphics and smooth arcade-like execution.
