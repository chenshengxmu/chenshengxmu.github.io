* I need it.  You need it.  We all need the 4.1 GreenPois0n jailbreak!  To help us wait out these final days, a guy who appropriately goes by the name of “Sadist” has a GreenPois0n battery, lockscreen and slider theme available in Cydia.
* Except after installing it I realized it just makes me more impatient for the new jailbreak, especially when the slider taunts “Inject the Pois0n.”  So he’s not just a sadist, he’s a tease…
* The theme is titled “Greenpois0n battery” although I didn’t notice any change to my battery, just the lockscreen and slider, as shown in the screenshot.  If you’re a real masochist, there’s also a slew of other GreenPois0n-themed tweaks in Cydia — Winterboard theme, Cydia icon, popup boxes.  None of them will jailbreak 4.1, but maybe they’ll ease your suffering.
* What do you think?  Does a GreenPois0n theme help or worsen your anxiety in waiting for the jailbreak?
