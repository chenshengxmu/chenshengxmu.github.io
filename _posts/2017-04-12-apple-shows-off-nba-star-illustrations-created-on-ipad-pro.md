* Apple today showcased work of the self-proclaimed “Vector Art Monster” aka Rob Zilla, who drew NBA star Kevin Durant with his iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.
* The iPad Pro + Apple Pencil combo allows the artist to create illustrations that Mashable has described as “bright, arresting sports imagery.”
* To celebrate the Golden State Warriors’ NBA-best regular season record, and star Kevin Durant’s return to the team just in time for the 2017 NBA Playoffs, the iPhone maker has shared images and videos showing off the illustration coming to life from start to finish.
* Zilla, who goes by the real name Robert Generette III, used Adobe’s Illustrator Draw app for iPad to draw the NBA star. As part of Warriors Fan Night, his work will be featured during tonight’s halftime at the Golden State Warriors regular season finale in Oakland.
* All fans who enter Oracle Arena this night will receive a special Warriors Fan Night T-shirt that features Warriors players, coaches, fans and legends. Furthermore, the first 10,000 fans shall receive Warriors “Starting 5” Cheer Card.
* Both the T-shirt and the Cheer Card were designed by Zilla.
* Here’s an animated GIF showing Zilla bringing Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant to life with a little help from his iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and Adobe’s creative apps.

* Very impressive indeed.
* “The Washington Wizards have also commissioned Rob Zilla to create portraits and murals of their players using iPad Pro and Apple Pencil,” writes Apple.
* Mashable says that drawing an illustration like this with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil takes between two and five hours. The artists typically uses a combination of reference, transparency and freehand, allowing him to draw over a reference photograph.
