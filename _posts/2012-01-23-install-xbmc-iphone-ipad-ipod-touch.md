* At iDB we’re big proponents of XBMC on the Apple TV, but what’s to stop one from doing the same thing on the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch? In a word, nothing.
* Inside we’ll show you how to get XBMC on your mobile iOS device, and we’ll give you a sneak peak at some of its awesome benefits…
* Step 1: Open Cydia, go to Manage > Sources > Edit and add the following source: http://mirrors.xbmc.org/apt/ios
* Step 2: Once the packages from the source are added, go into the source, and install XBMC-IOS
* Step 3: Once installed go to your Home screen, and you should now have XBMC for iOS. You may start using it immediately, but we will be back with more tutorials to show you how to get the most out of XBMC on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
* If you haven’t already, check out our tutorial that shows how to install XBMC on the Apple TV as well.
* What do you think? Would you enjoy having XBMC on the go?
