* Along with Apple’s just announced A7 chip, comes a companion chip called the M7 that serves as a “Motion coprocessor.” The purpose of this chip is to constantly measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass built into the iPhone 5s.
* This promises to open up a new playing field for health and fitness apps, in that they can actively track whether or not you’re stationary, walking, driving, and more.

* Developers will, of course, be able to take advantage of the dedicated motion processing, and Nike is on board with a brand new app called Nike+ Move.
