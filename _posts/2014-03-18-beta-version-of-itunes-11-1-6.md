* Apple has seeded a new beta of OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 to some of its employees today. The release comes one week after Apple released the second beta of 10.9.3 to devs, which included few noticeable changes.
* The new beta build is not yet available to registered Mac developers, but should be via the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store soon, or as a download via the Mac section of Apple’s developer portal…

* Today’s beta doesn’t bring anything new of note, but Apple also seeded a beta of iTunes 11.1.6 (via 9to5Mac) that’s worth mentioning as it “restores the ability to sync contacts and calendar info from your Mac.”
* As noted by MacRumors, this feature was removed in Mavericks to the complaints of many users—as evidenced by this 200+ page support thread with nearly 300K views. So the change will certainly be welcomed.
* The latest developer version of OS X 10.9.3 includes audio and graphic fixes, as well as a new Retina resolution option for Mac users with 4K displays.
