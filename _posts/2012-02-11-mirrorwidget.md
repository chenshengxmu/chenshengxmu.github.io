* MirrorWidget is a jailbreak tweak that places a mirror in iOS 5’s Notification Center. The “mirror” is just an image from either the front or rear facing camera; you can switch between the two, and you have the ability to snap a photo in the process.
* Making sure you look dapper has never been easier. Check out our video walkthrough straight ahead…
* A double tap on the widget will switch between your front and rear facing cameras, while a single tap will snap a photo for lasting memories.
* MirrorWidget can be had for free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo for jailbroken iDevices. You must be running iOS 5, and I’m assuming this works with dual camera devices only like the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and iPad 2.
