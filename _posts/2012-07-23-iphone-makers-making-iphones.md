* A new report is out tonight, claiming that Pegatron, one of Apple’s manufacturing partners in eastern China, has started production on the next-generation iPhone.
* The timing makes sense, considering Apple is widely expected to unveil the smartphone sometime in the next few months — late September, early October…
* DigiTimes reports:
* “Pegatron has begun production of new version of the Apple iPhone at its Shanghai, easter China, according to industry sources in Taiwan.”
* But don’t just take DigiTimes’ word for it. The more credible Macotakara reported a similar story earlier this month, not to mention that we’ve seen a number of recent case and component leaks that suggest the device is in — at least the early stages of — production.
* Why does this matter? Well because while Apple maintains a high level of secrecy regarding future products, part and information leaks tend to ramp up after they go into production. We expect to learn a lot more about the next-generation iPhone in the coming weeks.
* As for what we know (or at least think we know) about the handset thus far, it’s said to be a major upgrade from its predecessor, with a 4-inch display, LTE compatibility and an all-new case design.
