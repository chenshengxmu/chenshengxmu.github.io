* Last night, T-Mobile announced its financials for its second quarter, and the numbers were fantastic. The carrier added more than 1 million new subscribers, and sold over 4 million smartphones during the 3-month period.
* In the press release, the company wouldn’t say how many of those 4 million phones were iPhones, only that the handset made up about 29% of their sales. During the conference call, though, it was much more forthcoming…
* As noted by CNET, during its earnings call with investors and analysts, T-Mobile executives said the company sold 900,000 iPhones during its second quarter. That matches up with previous estimates based on Q1 numbers.

* But the iPhone wasn’t the only smartphone success story for T-Mobile during the June quarter. The carrier says it also sold more than 600,000 Galaxy S4s. The handset launched at the beginning of the quarter, in late April.
* T-Mobile also introduced new contract-free price plans during the period, as well as a new device upgrade program. It also rolled out its LTE network to its first markets, and completed the acquisition of regional carrier MetroPCS.
* Skeptics have suggested that the combination of all of these things attributed to a one-time hit quarter for T-Mobile, and that it won’t happen again. But the company’s CEO John Leger believes that this is all just the beginning.
