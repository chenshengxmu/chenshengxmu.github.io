* Despite what Google’s Eric Schmidt would have you believe, developers still prefer Apple’s iOS platform over any other mobile operating system. More importantly, the vast majority of programmers don’t think a rumored introduction of a taller iPhone this fall will complicate their life as adapting their apps to a larger canvas shouldn’t be a biggie…
* In a research note to clients relayed by Barron’s, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster notes that his survey of a hundred developers during WWDC shows that most developers still prefer writing apps for the Apple ecosystem over Android devices.
* iOS beat other platforms on ease of development and revenue potential with percentages of 84 percent and 64 percent, respectively.
* 55 of those surveyed also develop for Android, 14 also develop for Windows, and 9 also develop for BlackBerry.
* We believe that Apple’s loyal developer base will continue to develop cutting edge apps for iOS that will draw in new customers, helping to fuel continued growth in iOS device sales.
* The analyst also wrote that on a scale of one to ten, a rumored four-inch iPhone scored 3.4 in terms of how difficult it would be to adapt apps to a larger canvas, leading him to conclude that “the introduction of new screen sizes would not affect the success or availability of the apps on iOS”.

* Two problems with this survey:
* 1. it’s biased as most WWDC attendees were people who make a living on iOS 2. sample size is too small
* Android chief Andy Rubin tweeted ahead of the WWDC keynote that Google is now seeing an astounding 900,000 device activations each day.
* Google’s Play Store for Android apps seems to be catching up, having recently passed the 500,000 app milestone versus 650,000 apps on the App Store.
* What do you think, how long before developers’ preference tilts toward Android?
