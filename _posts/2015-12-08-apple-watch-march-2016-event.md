* Citing sources with knowledge of the plans, 9to5Mac is reporting that Apple is planning a media event in March of next year to unveil a second-generation Apple Watch, with the possible announcement of a rumored four-inch iPhone refresh in tow as well.
* If true, the company would start shipping the second-generation watch in April, a year following the original model’s debut in April of 2015.
* “Apple began to develop technologies destined for future Apple Watch models long before the first generation even shipped,” claims the report.
* The same publication previously reported that the Apple Watch 2 will feature a faster chip, a built-in camera for FaceTime video calling and improved Wi-Fi networking to reduce the device’s dependance on an iPhone for network connectivity and location services.
* New sensors are also possible to enable features that were supposedly missing from the original model, such as sleep tracking and more.
