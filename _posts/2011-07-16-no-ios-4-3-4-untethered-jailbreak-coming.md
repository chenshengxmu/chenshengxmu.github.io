* Apple released iOS 4.3.4 yesterday, and as always, the Dev Team was right on it and updated RedSn0w to version 0.9.8 beta 3, which is a tethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.4 for all devices (except the iPad 2).
* Those of you (all of us?) waiting for an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.4 shouldn’t get their hopes too high. As iOS hacker i0n1c mentioned today on Twitter, there probably won’t be an iOS 4.3.4 untether anytime soon…
* Apple stepped up their game a bit and is making it harder for hackers to find holes to exploit. Still, you never know what to expect, and we can always hope for an “accidental finding.”
