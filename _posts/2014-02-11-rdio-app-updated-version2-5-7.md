* Good news for Rdio users this afternoon. The music streaming service has posted an update for its iOS client, bringing the app to version 2.5.7 and adding a few new features including Playlist Editing and the ability to read and write reviews in-app.
* Users can now edit their playlists from any mobile device by adding, removing and rearranging songs, and editing playlist artwork. They can also now write reviews for those playlists, and albums, and read reviews written by other other Rdio users…
* Here are the release notes for version 2.5.7:
* What’s New in Version 2.5.7
* – Playlist Editing. Now, you can update your playlists from any mobile device. Add, remove and rearrange tracks; add and edit playlist artwork; change visibility and collaboration settings and more. – Reviews. Write album and playlist reviews right from the app, and read reviews by critics and other Rdio listeners. – Various UI improvements and minor bug fixes.
* All in all this is a solid update, which helps to round out the functionality of the app. In December, Rdio updated its iOS client with an all new Profile view, and a new Sleep Timer function, which allows you to stop music playback after a period of time.
* I’m currently using iTunes Radio for my streaming music service, but if I were to go with a paid plan, it’d be Rdio. The music selection is there and the app is phenomenal. If you want to check it out, you can find the Rdio app in the App Store for free.
* Rdio has a free Radio option, but if you want to play songs on-demand, the monthly fee begins at $9.99 for mobile.
