* Apple’s highly anticipated “Spring Forward“ media event is due in less than two hours and a report by The Wall Street Journal is now alleging that the company has been evaluating platinum for future versions of the Apple Watch.
* Apple promised to offer the wrist-worn device in three versions created from custom alloys of stainless steel and aluminum, each in two finishes, as well as “unique formulations of 18-karat yellow and rose gold.”
* According to the newspaper’s source familiar with the matter, the Cupertino firm also “has studied platinum Watch casings” although it’s “not expected” to announce that on Monday.
* Because the device has been designed to be both functional and fashionable, Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University, predicted that Apple will benefit from making inroads into the world of high fashion.
* “Apple will become the first trillion-dollar market-cap company on the back of a successful transition to a luxury brand,” he said.
* Consumer interest in the device my be higher than anticipated.
* According to a February 2015 poll of 1,000 Americans who own either a smartphone or a tablet conducted by Adobe’s analytics arm, one in ten Apple users might buy the device when it goes on sale next month, equating to around 25 million sales.
* “Ten percent. That’s my guess. I’m going to go a little low here,” says Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst, Adobe Digital Index. We know Apple has sold a billion iOS devices to date and assuming 500 – 750 million are still in use, Gaffney’s ten percent estimate would represent 50 – 75 million Watch sales.

* As the chart above illustrates, 27 percent said they were likely or very likely to buy a wearable device while 67 percent of those specifically underscored they were likely or very likely to buy the Apple Watch.
* The results are echoed by Morgan Stanley, which surveyed US consumers ahead of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch releases to see if they’d buy one, here are their findings.
