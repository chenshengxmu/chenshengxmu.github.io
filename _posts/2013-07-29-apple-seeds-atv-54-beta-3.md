* Alongside iOS 7 beta 4, Apple has seeded beta 3 of Apple TV 5.4 software to developers this morning. The update isn’t nearly as expansive as its iOS device counterpart, but it does bring about a number of improvements and bug fixes.
* Interestingly enough, the new beta also appears to allow users running iOS 7 to setup their Apple TV with their iPhone or iPad after a full restore or resetting all settings (iPhone 4 and iPad 2 not supported). Release notes after the fold…
* Here is a list of the changes:
* Notes: You can now use an iOS 7 device to set up an Apple TV after restoring or resetting all settings. (iPhone 4 and iPad 2 are not supported.)
* – Apple TV may not connect to the Internet on first boot after an iTunes Restore when using Ethernet. – Music playback may skip over tracks when AirPlay is engaged. – AirPlay of audio from the Music app may fail to start up properly. – Attempting to delete a station in iTunes Radio may cause Apple TV to crash. – Switching between Apple IDs may cause music libraries to fail to load. – Audio volume may increase dramatically during AirPlay. – When using AirPlay to send music to Apple TV, advancing to the next track may fail. – You may notice these issues when fast-forwarding 3rd party content: – Audio continues to play while video is fast-forwarding. – Resuming playback after fast-forwarding can result in a temporarily stuck video frame. – Apple TV may become sluggish or unresponsive immediately after signing in to an iTunes Store account. – iTunes Match or Purchased music content may not be listed alphabetically. Use Search as an alternative for finding content.
* If you’re a registered developer, you can download the new Apple TV beta firmware here. And as always, we welcome you to let us know if you spot any changes that we haven’t mentioned yet by e-mailing us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
