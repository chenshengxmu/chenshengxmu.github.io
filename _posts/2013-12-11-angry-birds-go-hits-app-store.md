* In keeping with its promise to release a new game on December 11, Finnish games developer Rovio Mobile on Wednesday posted Angry Birds Go! on the App Store.
* The kart-racing game is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Mario Kart in that you’ll be racing through speedways, canyons, stunt roads and air courses and enjoying a variety of racing modes like Race, Time Boom, Fruit Splat, Champion Chase and Mega Match.
* As Angry Birds Go! is set in Rovio’s Angry Birds universe, expect to see the familiar Piggy Island rendered in nice 3D graphics and a selection of familiar (and playable) Angry Birds characters, including the iconic pigs like King Pig and Mustache Pig.
* There are over 50 soapbox karts to ride, and you can upgrade them by collecting bird coins. The game is available on a free-to-play basis, with in-app purchases available for coins, gems and various power-ups. I’ve included a launch trailer and some pretty screenies after the break…
* From the blurb:
* Welcome to downhill racing on Piggy Island! In the NEW Angry Birds Go! launch trailer, see those birds and piggies go head-to-head in a fast and furious race to the finish line.
* Check out the trailer.
* I love that the game lets me teleport characters from Hasbro’s TELEPODS figures.
* This “important message for parents” section from iTunes release notes has definitely caught my attention.
