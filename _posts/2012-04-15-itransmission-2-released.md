* BitTorrent users rejoice. iTransmission, the popular iOS BitTorrent client, has finally been updated to support the latest versions of Apple’s mobile software.
* The jailbreak utility, which was abandoned by developer Mike Chen sometime last year, has just been resurrected by ioshomebrew as iTransmission 2…
* Like the previous version, iTransmission 2 is extremely easy to use. Once installed, simply navigate to any BitTorrent file in Safari (or other browser) and select the option to open it via the utility. Depending on seeders, your download should start right away.
* The app has a hidden preference panel, which can be accessed by swiping left to right from the edge of the screen. It offers a number of customizable options, including a port-picker and a download restrictor.
* With its simple user interface and $0 price tag, we can’t think of a reason not to try this out. iTransmission 2 is available in Cydia, in the ModMyi repo, for free.
* Have you tried out iTransmission 2 yet?
