* If you are a Spotify subscriber who has decided to give other music-subscription services a try, you can end your Premium subscription at any time, which reverts your account back to the free service when the current subscription period runs out.
* But if you’re positive that you won’t be coming back at all, you might be considering closing your Spotify account.
* In this post, we’re going to lay out the steps involved in permanently deleting accounts on Spotify.
* Spotify’s mobile apps don’t provide the option to delete accounts and the previously available account deletion links on the webpage are no longer available. Instead, you now must contact Spotify Support and send them an account deletion request via email.
* Step 1: Visit Spotify’s contact form in a browser and sign in with your user name and password.
* Step 2: Select any category.

* Step 3: A new webpage will load with various topics. Select any topic to continue.

* Step 4: Choose the green I Still Need Help button at the bottom.

* Step 5: Type anything in the “Tell us more” field. For instance, I just entered “I want to close my Spotify account.”

* Step 6: Click the Send Question button to send your query to Spotify in the form of an email message using your email address on file.
* Step 7: You will receive an auto-response directing you back to the Spotify Community. Don’t fret: just reply directly to that email with a request to delete your account and your message will reach one of Spotify’s human agents, who will take it from there.
* Step 8: You might need to follow up on that email with any information necessary to confirm your identity, like your date of birth. It might be a good idea to whitelist spotify.com so that emails from support staff don’t get classed as spam.
* Step 9: Spotify will issue an email within a few days to confirm that your account has been successfully deleted. Now you can uninstall Spotify from your laptop, desktop, tablets and mobile devices.
* Closing your account will prevent you from accessing any of the information stored on it, including your custom playlists and offline songs. You also won’t be able to sign up again for Spotify with the same user name.
