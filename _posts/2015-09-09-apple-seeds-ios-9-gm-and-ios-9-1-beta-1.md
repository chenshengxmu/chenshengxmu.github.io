* Ahead of next week’s September 16th’s iOS 9 public release, Apple has seeded the iOS 9 Golden Master seed. This release, baring any unforeseen circumstances, will contain the same code that ships to customers next week.
* Apple also took the time to release the first public beta of iOS 9.1. Reports have stated that the newly announced iPad Pro will come with iOS 9.1 once it ships in November.
* Both iOS 9 GM and iOS 9.1 beta 1 are now available for download via Apple’s Developer Center.
* The iOS 9 GM seed is listed as build 13A340, while the iOS 9.1 beta 1 seed is listed as build 13B5110e.
* Unfortunately, the release notes for the software downloads are not yet working, but we’ll be sure to update this post once Apple provides valid links.
* We’ll also be back with a recap of what’s new, if anything, in the iOS 9 GM and iOS 9.1 beta.
