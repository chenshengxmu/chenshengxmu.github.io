* Having posted the Wallpapers of the Week for well over a year, certain trends become apparent to us. Popularity of images can be predicted and we try to stick to topics we know readers will enjoy. Of course, every now and then we need to vary from topic to topic. After all, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Not all wallpapers are created equal. What you see is what you get. And, any other cliche you can think of about imagery.
* Today, however, we harken back to a topical wallpaper post theme, made popular by several other previous posts. Focusing today on space, is not a new trend, but a popular version by way of social shares. Step inside for details, downloads and backlinks.
* We featured space focused wallpaper imagery previously and it proved quite popular. Before downloading today’s offering, take a look back through some of our previous selections: Interstellar; galaxy creation; stars and moons; and galaxy wallpapers.
* The options below are also in the same genre. Although, if looking closely, you will find another Interstellar reference in one of today’s images.

* This time, I am sending out a specific request, not just a blanket appeal for any wallpaper. While creating this wallpaper set, I spent a good time looking for quality Guardians of the Galaxy images. There were little to none. For a future post, I am requesting iPhone and iPad wallpaper images for Guardians of the Galaxy. If you have them, can find them, or make them, catch up with me @jim_gresham.
* Please, make sure the images are made for at least iPhone 6 Plus and iPad retina screens. For that, the images will need to be at least 1080×1920 for iPhone 6 Plus and 2048×2048 for iPad. I look forward to seeing the results!
