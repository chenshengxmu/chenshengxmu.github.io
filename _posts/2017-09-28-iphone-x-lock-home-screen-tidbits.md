* Although we’ve already written a lot about iPhone X there are still some aspects to it that we haven’t explored in detail, especially its Lock screen and Home screen experiences.

* The new Xcode includes a more fully-fledged iPhone X Simulator that gives us a peek at the handset’s new Lock screen and Home screen experiences, as detailed below.

* While the new Xcode simulator is in beta and a bit rough around the edges, it does give us a better idea what iOS 11 will look like on the edge-to-edge rounded screen of iPhone X.
