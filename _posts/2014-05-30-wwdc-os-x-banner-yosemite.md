* Apple is continuing to decorate the Moscone Center this afternoon ahead of next week’s Worldwide Developers Conference. Earlier today we saw water-covered banners go up for iOS 8, and now we have an image of the inaugural OS X 10.10 banner.
* As you can see in the image above, the sign consists of a large X in front of a mountainous background. It’s believed this is actually the ‘El Capitan’ rock formation in Yosemite national park, which would suggest Apple is calling the 10.10 update ‘Yosemite.’
* Of course, we’ve known since April that Apple was going to be talking about the next version of OS X at WWDC, but this is the first time we’ve seen any indication of what it’ll be called. And it just so happens, Apple has filed for a Yosemite trademark.
* Given that last year’s OS X Mavericks only introduced minor changes, OS X 10.10 is expected be a significant update. Recent reports claim the OS will receive an iOS 7-type makeover, and the task is so big that iOS engineers have been called upon to help.
* WWDC kicks off on Monday, June 2 at 10 AM PST with Apple’s keynote. We’ve already confirmed that there will be a live stream of the event, but we will of course still be providing full coverage of all of the announcements and other additional commentary.
