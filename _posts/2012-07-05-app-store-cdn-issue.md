* Something went amiss in Apple’s application stores for iPhone and Mac apps, causing newly updated apps to crash. Users are reporting that a number of popular apps quit immediately upon loading, though this issue only seems to affect freshly updated software.
* Newly updated versions of Instapaper, Readdle Scanner Pro and Angry Birds Space HD Free have all been accused of crashing upon being updated to the latest version.
* Instapaper developer Marco Arment pinpoints the issue over at his blog to a likely server bug with the App Store’s content distribution network. Apple has yet to acknowledge the problem or issue a statement…
* Details remain scarce, but it seems the issue plagues certain apps and specific regional app stores only. Being based out in Europe and using the US App Store, I downloaded the latest version of Instapaper that Marco pushed out this week.
* Sure thing it keeps on crashing on my iPhone 4S running the latest iOS 6 Beta, indicating Apple hasn’t yet removed corrupt binaries from its servers.
* Forbes thinks it’s an encryption glitch.
* The Next Web has a comprehensive list of the affected programs.
* According to Marco, Apple is to blame as it submitted corrupt binaries.
* Last night, within minutes of Apple approving the Instapaper 4.2.3 update, I was deluged by support email and Twitter messages from customers saying that it crashed immediately on launch, even with a clean install.
* He advises fellow developers to wait until Apple fixes the bug.
* If you’re a developer, and you have a non-critical update pending release, I suggest waiting a few days for this to presumably get sorted out before releasing it.
* Graham Spencer offers a remedy in his article over at MacStories:
* If you’ve already been affected by the issue, the only real way to fix it is to delete the app and try re-installing the app – but this will only work if the app is no longer corrupted on Apple’s side.
* GoodReader advises how to back up settings and restore them upon re-installation so you may wanna check out these instructions if you’re having issues with their app.
* Let us know in the comments if you’re seeing this problem with your favorite apps.
