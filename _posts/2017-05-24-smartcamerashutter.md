* If you’re looking for new ways to customize the Camera app experience on your iPhone or iPad, then check out a new free jailbreak tweak called SmartCameraShutter by CydiaGeek.
* This tweak offers a handful of options for chaging the look and feel of the Camera app’s user interface. Complete with both aesthetic and functional mods, SmartCameraShutter might be worth installing if the stock Camera app experience isn’t cutting it for you.
* The first thing you’ll notice after installing the tweak is that it adds a preferences pane to the Settings app for configuring a handful of options:

* Among the options you configure here are:
* We find that since it’s easy to swipe between options in the Camera app by accident, the first option can be quite helpful in mitigating these mistakes. The second option comes in handy when you want to be discreet while taking a photo, as it silences the noise that normally gives you away.
* The last two options are mostly aesthetic, and can be manipulated in ways to give the shutter button a different look. The different styles you can get by playing around with these options are illustrated below:

* The biggest difference you’ll see is the absence or presence of the ring around the button or the button fill itself. It’s also possible to hide both of these elements so that the shutter button seems to disappear completely.
* Overall, the first two options seem to be what will make or break the tweak’s usefulness for you, as they have a functional purpose rather than just aesthetic. Then again, if you have a desire to hide or show either part of the shutter button, the tweak has your back there too.
* If you’re interested in giving SmartCameraShutter a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices and is only compatible with the stock Camera app.
