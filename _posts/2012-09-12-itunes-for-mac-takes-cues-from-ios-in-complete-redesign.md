* As expected, iTunes has been completely overhauled, and the changes look to be significant.
* Taking obvious cues from the mobile space, albums open on the same screen, similar to folders on iOS. Along with the obvious visual differences comes new inline searching, and a mini player, which is sure to enthuse minimalists.

* The new iTunes is simplified, integrated with iCloud, features a redesigned iTunes store, mini player, and a new featured called Up Next.
* Up Next allows you to more efficiently view, and change the order of upcoming tracks.
* The new iTunes is scheduled to drop in October of this year. What do you think?
