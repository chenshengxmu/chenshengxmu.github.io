* Shortly after Tim Cook wrapped up Apple’s big keynote yesterday, developers and other WWDC attendees made their way over to another popular event: the 2013 Apple Design Award show.
* Every year, Apple hands out awards to outstanding iOS and OS X apps based on a number of factors like design, and innovation. And the winners of this year’s prestigious Design Awards are…
* Student winners:

* Coda 2 by Panic, Inc.

* The selections this year don’t come as a surprise, as we’ve highlighted a number of these apps on iDB for being standouts. We particularly liked the UI design of both Letterpress and Yahoo! Weather.
