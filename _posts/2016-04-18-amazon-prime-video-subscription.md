* Online retailer Amazon announced this morning that it has started to offer its Prime Video service as a standalone subscription independent of its $99.99 annual Prime membership, which includes things like free two-day shipping, unlimited streaming of music, movies and television shows and other perks.
* In an effort to step up its challenge to Netflix, the e-commerce giant has priced its standalone offering at $8.99 per month—a dollar more than Netflix’s entry-level $7.99 plan in the United States.
* Netflix recently jacked the price of its service to new users from $8.99 to $9.99 and will impose the same price increase on its longtime customers by this summer, potentially making its offering less competitive than Prime Video from a pricing standpoint.
* Previously, the only way to get access to the Prime Video service was by subscribing to the aforementioned $99.99 per year Prime membership. In the United Kingdom, Prime Video is available on a monthly subscription basis for £5.99, or about $8.50 per month.
* Netflix, by far the biggest provider of streamed Hollywood entertainment, recently launched in 130 new countries so Amazon is facing an uphill battle because its own service is officially available in just a handful of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Japan.
* Last week, Netflix enabled high-dynamic range (HDR) video streaming. The company has invested heavily into original programming over the years, but Amazon has also done the same.
* Be that as it may, now that Prime Video is a standalone subscription service there’s an increased chance that Amazon will be bringing its video-streaming service to the Apple TV in the form of a downloadable tvOS application, as previously rumored.
* On a related note, the e-commerce giant unveiled a $10.99 per month Prime service independent of the full $99.99 per year Prime membership, giving fans the option to enjoy Amazon’s express delivery service without committing to a full year of Prime.
* Amazon is scheduled to report its first quarter results this morning.
