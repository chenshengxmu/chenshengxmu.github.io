* The Unicode Consortium has finalized 157 new emoji, of which 77 are brand new characters, that Apple and other companies will be incorporating into their platforms later this year.
* Emoji website Emojipedia has shared Apple-like images of the new emoji. Some of the most notable additions include new faces, animals, food options, activities and modifiers:
* All of the newly proposed human emoji characters support skin tones.
* This is also the first time new options are available for hair color, ranging from red hair and curly hair to white hair and complete baldness. These cool new modifiers are available for use in sequences for men and women of any skin tone.
