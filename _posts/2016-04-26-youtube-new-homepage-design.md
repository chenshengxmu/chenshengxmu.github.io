* Google just said that YouTube’s mobile apps for iOS and Android are gaining a revamped homepage design today. The newly redesigned Home feed within the mobile app has a clean look and a simple format “that invites you to discover and enjoy,” said Google.
* More importantly, the overhauled Home feed now does a better job spotlighting content you might be interested in with smarter recommendations based on deep neural networks and larger high-resolution video thumbnails which make it easy to identify videos you want to watch.
* As a bonus, the creator for every video is now more visible than before thanks to their icon being displayed more prominently within your feed. More than just a fresh coat of paint, your Home feed should also be smarter than before.
* Thanks to the new recommendation system based on deep neural network technology, you’ll see more relevant personalized recommendations in the Home feed.
* The system gets better the more you use it.
* I browse YouTube every day and have noticed that the Home feed has become a lot smarter lately. It’s way better than before, recommending exactly the videos I’m interested in based on what I’ve already watched.
* “One of the biggest improvements is how the system suggests more recent videos and those from the creators you love,” said Google. “People who have tried the new system have spent more time watching fresh videos and content from their Subscriptions.”
* It’s an incredibly scalable system: YouTube recommends hundreds of millions of different videos on the Home feed each day, billions of times, in 76 languages.
* This overhauled Home feed is a server-side update so it should start appearing later today in YouTube for iOS and Android without needing an app update.
* Download YouTube for iOS for free on the App Store.
