* CustomColor is a jailbreak tweak for those of you wishing to change the colors of your app icon labels. It features separate settings for dock icons and non-dock icons, and features simple RGB sliders to adjust the colors of your labels.
* There’s even an option to set random colors for each app icon label. In my testing, the tweak worked fairly well, but it’s not without its share of issues as you’ll notice inside…
* The main issue that I experienced with CustomColor is that the app icon labels for the non-dock icons change no matter what, even if I have CustomColor disabled for non-dock icons. There were other bugs that I encountered, such as random colors not working properly on non-dock labels.
* It’s nice to be able to customize your app icon colors down to a specific RGB value, just don’t expect it to work perfectly.
* Fortunately, this is a free tweak, so it’s not as if you’re losing anything when you experience problems. In most cases it worked decently.
* To give CustomColor a shot, head over to Cydia and download it for free today. Be sure to share your thoughts about the tweak in our comment section below.
