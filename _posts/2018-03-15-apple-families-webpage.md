* Apple yesterday published a new webpage that brings all of its parental controls in one place.
* Available at apple.com/families, this new section of the Apple website details the Cupertino company’s accessibility efforts to make iPhones, iPads and Macs more family-friendly. The webpage provides a bunch fo links to useful resources, like support documents detailing parental controls and other safety features.
* TUTORIAL: restricting apps and media your kids can enjoy
* The webpage describes in layman’s terms Apple’s privacy controls that allow customers to do things like restrict location tracking, limit In-App Purchases, filter out inappropriate content, prevent iPhones from receiving notifications while driving and so forth.
* TIP: finding out how much time you spend in iPhone and iPad apps
* Apple and other major technology giants came under fire recently over whether the smartphones, tablets and other gadgets they make are too addictive, especially for children.
* “We have reviewed the evidence and we believe there is a clear need for Apple to offer parents more choices and tools to help them ensure that young consumers are using your products in an optimal manner,” reads an excerpt from an open letter to Apple penned by two prominent Silicon Valley investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers Retirement System.
* “By doing so, we believe Apple would once again be playing a pioneering role, this time by setting an example about the obligations of tech companies to their youngest customers,” continues the letter, aptly titled “Think Differently About Your Kids.”
* We should expect more work from Apple in this area. After all, Apple reacted publicly to the letter by promising it was working on additional accessibility features and parental controls.
* I wish iOS permitted us to set up separate profiles for kids…
* Thoughts?
