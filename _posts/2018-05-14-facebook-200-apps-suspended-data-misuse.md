* Facebook has removed approximately 200 apps over potential data misuse.
* The company said today that its investigation process is in full swing, just like CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised during the recent congressional hearing over massive privacy breach by data-mining political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
* Reuters reports that the company identifyied misbehaving apps which accessed “large quantities of user data.” Shares of Facebook were up 0.4 percent at $187.65 in premarket trading today.
* Not all apps are guilty of breaching user trust. In fact, all of the suspended apps are pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data. “Where we find evidence that these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them,” said the firm.
* The social networking behemoth has pledged to notify people if they or their friends installed an app that misused data before 2015. Facebook cautions that there’s a lot more work to be done to find all the apps that may have misused people’s Facebook data, which “will take time.”

* The social network intends to investigate all the apps that had access to large amounts of information before the company changed its platform policies back in 2014. Any app that either refused or failed an audit would be banned from the Facebook platform.
* What else should Facebook do to mitigate the fallout from this scandal?
* Leave your thoughts in the comment below.
