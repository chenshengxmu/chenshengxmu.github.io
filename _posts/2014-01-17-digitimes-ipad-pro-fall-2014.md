* According to Taiwan-based supply chain makers, Apple is accelerating development of a rumored large-screen iPad, the iPad Pro, and is gearing up to launch the device by the end of the third quarter, indicating a Fall launch alongside the expected refresh to the existing iPad lineup.
* As the unnamed sources asseverated, Apple has also asked its component suppliers and manufacturing partners to prepare for new models of 7.9 and 9.7-inch iPads…
* The report, published Friday by DigiTimes, asserts that Apple is accelerating development of large-size iPads in light of Samsung’s recent introduction of the new 12-inch Galaxy tablets.
* “Market sources indicated that Apple is likely to release a 12.9-inch model by the end of the third quarter at the earliest,” the report has it.
* DigiTimes is not the most reliable publication but they more often than not are accurate when it comes to supply chain chatter. The story matches up to a recent research note by Evercore’s Patrick Wang, who said supply chain sources have confirmed the existence of the larger iPad.
* The 12-inch iPad, Wang wrote, will be powered by Apple’s upcoming A8 processor and will launch in the Fall of 2014. He described the device as a crossover of sorts between the iPad and the MacBook Air, “in the same spirit of Microsoft’s Surface.”
* Analyzing new display panels in development, display experts over at NPD DisplaySearch noted Apple’s alleged interest in 12.9-inch 2,732-by-2,048 pixel resolution panels. For all we know, these screens could be for a Retina MacBook Air upgrade, no?
* This is just another iPad Pro rumor so take it with a pinch of salt as we have yet to see some concrete evidence of the device’s existence in the form of component leaks. On the other hand, a number of rumors have suggested that the iPad Pro is in the works.
* That said, would a large-screen iPad make sense do you think?
* Do we really need an iPad that bridges the gap between tablet and notebook?
* And more importantly, will you buy it if Apple releases it?
