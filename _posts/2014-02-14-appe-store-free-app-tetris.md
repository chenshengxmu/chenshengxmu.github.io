* This week’s Free App of the Week on the App Store is Max Axe, an over-the-top endless runner where you kill beasts by drawing with your finger to throw axes. If this sounds a little underwhelming, the official Apple Store app in its ongoing promotion is now giving away Electronic Arts’ excellent take on the classic Tetris game. Having played countless Tetris versions over the years, Twintris for the Amiga 500 was by far the most fun I’ve ever had smashing simple geometric shapes down to clear the lines.
* Electronics Arts’ modernized mobile Tetris edition is the closest thing to Twintris. It’s a highly recommended download so fire up the Apple Store app and claim your free copy now, here’s how…
* The description reads:
* One of the bestselling mobile games of all time, Tetris, is now updated with more features than ever before. This blast from the past is enhanced for iOS 7 and includes newly redesigned levels and one-touch controls.
* And this is how you’ll download Tetris free through the Apple Store app:
* Step 1: Fire up the Apple Store app (free download from the App Store)
* Step 2: Hit the Stores button at the bottom
* Step 3: Use the search field to find any U.S. retail outlet (i.e. ‘Manhattan, New York’)
* Step 4: Tap on the store in your search results to get to its landing page
* Step 5: Hit the Tetris link with the ‘A throwback for you. On us.’ banner, found directly underneath the ‘Love is in the Air’ Valentine’s Day sale section
* Step 6: Tap the big green ‘Download now for free’ button
* Step 7: Hit ‘Continue’ to confirm you want to betaken to the App Store
* Step 8: Type in your App Store credentials
* Step 9: finally, hit ‘Redeem’ in the upper-right corner
* This will immediately initiate a free download of Tetris. Note that this offer, first spotted by MacRumors, is set to expire on April 7, 2014. Also important: the promo code is only redeemable in the U.S. App Store.

* The game was last refreshed mid-November with a newly redesigned Galaxy Mode, more challenging puzzles, a new three-star rating system and more.
* Tetris for iPhone normally costs $0.99 in the App Store and the iPad edition is an additional $2.99. Folks who can’t get enough of Tetris are advised to check out Tetris Blitz, another Tetris-themed Electronics Arts release published eight months ago.
* Unlike the “normal” Tetris version, Tetris Blitz comes with a Twintris-like twist to it:
* Race against the clock in a two-minute blitz to clear lines and rack up as many points as possible before time runs out! With all-new features, stunning visuals, and innovative controls, this twist on the world-famous puzzle game is a must-have on mobile.
* Speaking of Twintris, here it is in action on the Amiga 500, the most awesome home computer I have ever owned.
* That was nearly 25 years ago!
* Tetris Blitz is available in the App Store on a free-to-play basis, with some in-app purchases.
