* There’s a new widget available that allows you to initiate a Cydia search via a Notification Center widget, and it’s appropriately titled Cydia-SearchNC.
* This free download can be enabled via the Notifications panel in the Settings app, and doing so creates a handy search field directly in Notification Center.
* Check out our video walkthrough that showcases how this jailbreak widget performs, after the break…
* As you might have guessed, Cydia-SearchNC is a free download for jailbroken iOS users, and you can find it on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* It works just as advertised, though it would have been better if it was able to query Cydia without actually opening the app. Still, I think you’ll find it a solid addition to your Notification Center if you’ve been looking for something similar.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
