* We were hoping that this year’s CES would see the introduction of new iOS 7 gaming controllers, given how dismal the options are right now, and so far it hasn’t disappointed. Yesterday, SteelSeries introduced its new Stratus controller, and today we’re adding another option to the list.
* What you see above is the ‘RP One,’ a Bluetooth gamepad with a traditional console-style layout made by Signal. As you can see, the controller is wireless—meaning you’ll be able to use it with your iPad and any other compatible iOS devices—and it looks a lot like the popular Xbox controller…
* From Signal’s press release:
* SIGNAL™, a new brand focused on design and performance, is providing CES attendees with an exclusive preview of the RP Onewireless game controller concept. Designed for compatibility with all iOS 7 devices, theRP One is a Bluetooth enabled wireless controller that delivers a console-quality experience in terms of playability and performance.
* “We are at the dawn of the next major era of gaming,” says SIGNAL Director of Business Development & Channel Marketing, Mark Prince. “The RP One is our invitation to the future. Gamers want to experience their favorite titles anywhere, anytime, without limitation, and the RP One enables them to do it. It is the first full-scale controller designed specifically for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.” 
* The RP One is lightweight, and features precision triggers, buttons, a d-pad and a pair of joysticks. The controller comes with a universal stand for your iOS device (compatible with most covers and cases) and a charging cable. And the built-in lithium ion battery provides up to 10 hours of play.
* Here’s a hands-on video from our own Jim Gresham:
* Game compatibility is on par with the other controllers—works with any game that supports iOS 7 game controllers—as is its price tag. If you’re interested, the RP One is expected to be available in the first half of this year with a price tag of $99.99. For more information on Signal, click here.
