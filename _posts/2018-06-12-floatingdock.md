* Starting with iOS 11, the Dock has become much smarter on the iPad. Not only does it serve as a spot for your favorite apps, but it can also suggest other apps based upon your usage.
* Unfortunately, iPhone users don’t get the same treatment, but a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed FloatingDock by iOS developer Kiran Patil can change that.
* When you install FloatingDock on your  iPhone, you get more than just an iPad-esque look and feel; you also get to enjoy killer functionality that makes the Dock more useful as an app-launching tool.
* For starters, the tweak can keep track of the apps you use most frequently and recommend them to you. Alternatively, it can recommend recently-used apps just like on a stock iPad.
* FloatingDock adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane so that you can save your changes after modifying the settings.
* Not only does FloatingDock help make the iPhone Dock experience more like it is on the iPad, but it brings you additional customization options that you won’t find on a stock iPad. In my opinion, it’s an upgrade from the stock iPhone Dock in every way, and it’s worth trying out.
* You can download FloatingDock for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is made to work on jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Do you like the iPad’s Dock more than the iPhone’s? Share in the comments.
