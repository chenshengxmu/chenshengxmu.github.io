* Apple is currently putting the finishing touches on its next-generation iPhone. And if the flurry of rumors and so-called insider reports are to be believed, the handset is going to feature an Ultra Retina display that will come in two sizes: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch, among other improvements.
* With that in mind, you can understand why this new 5.5-inch panel from Japan Display—a long time Apple supplier—is so interesting to us. Unveiled this week, the panel measures 5.5-inches and is of the Quad HD (aka WQHD) variety, with a resolution of 1,440 x 2,560 and a ppi of 538…
* Here’s CNET with the report:
* “Japan Display could be providing a hint of iPhone attractions to come. The company announced on Thursday that it has developed a 5.5-inch-wide Quad HD, aka, WQHD, display with a resolution of 1,440x 2,560 vertical pixels as a display format for “leading-edge smartphones.”
* The Japanese company — a major supplier of iPhone displays — said it will begin shipping the 5.5-inch LCD in April.”
* And here’s a photo of the display:

* Perhaps not coincidentally, Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported this week that Apple is going to be launching a new iPhone this year with both 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. It named Japan Display as a supplier, and said panel resolution would be “significantly higher” than current models.
* We still know very little about the new iPhone, as details outside of the display have been fairly scarce and inconsistent. It’s believed to be slimmer than the current-gen model, with a refreshed design and A8 processor, and other reports have called for an 8MP rear camera, 2GB of RAM and more.
* Some reports have suggested that Apple could launch the handset as early as this summer, but all signs still point to a standard fall release.
