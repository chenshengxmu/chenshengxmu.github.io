* Rumors have been going wild lately about Sprint getting the iPhone sometime next month. From installing signal repeaters around Apple Stores, to saying its network is ready for iPhone traffic, it almost seems inevitable at this point that the company will indeed get the iPhone.
* Today, at an investors conference, Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse said that in order to reach their financial targets for the fiscal year, the company would need to get “a very strong fourth quarter”…
* What better way to get a strong quarter but to sell a high profile communication device, just around the holidays? I’m thinking about the iPhone of course. It does seem that this was yet another hint that Sprint will get the iPhone.
* When asked about the iPhone on Sprint, Hesse declined to comment.
* We’ll find out for sure next month, when Tim Cook unveils the iPhone 5 on October 4th.
