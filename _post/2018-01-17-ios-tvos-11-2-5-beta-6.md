* Apple on Wednesday seeded the sixth betas of iOS 11.2.5 and tvOS 11.2.5 to developers. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air updating mechanism.
* The two releases come less than a week after their beta 5 counterparts, suggesting they are nearing closer to public launch. As we’ve noted for previous iOS 11.2.5 betas, these updates appear to be focused more on under-the-hood improvements.
* We’re currently installing today’s betas, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
