* We’re just hours away from Apple’s most important consumer-focused media event that will reveal the new phone, watches and other gadgets, and now Apple itself seems to have leaked a pair of new sizes for an upcoming Series 4 watch update.
* AllThingsHow has reportedly managed to extract the new Series 4 sizes from the URLs referencing the upcoming products, found in an updated sitemap for the Apple website.
* The new watch models should come in 40mm and 44mm, a notable increase over the current 38mm and 42mm sizes for existing models. The new sizes include the Silver, Space Gray and Gold color options, as well as both GPS and GPS + Cellular configurations.
* The URLs don’t specifically mention “Series 4” models, but there’s no doubt in our mind they reference the new watches. Apple Watch measurements refer to the vertical case size.
* The current 38mm watches are 33.3mm wide. 42mm ones are 35.9mm wide. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier that the new Series 4 models would be about 39.9mm and 45.2mm wide in terms of case size and have about 15% larger display with rounded corners.

* As MacRumors notes, the 40mm watches also include some new Nike and Hermès options.
* Hermès includes an Indigo Craie Orange Double Tour band with a Stainless Steel case. Nike has Pure Platinum Black Sport Band, Summit White Sport Loop, Anthracite Black Sport Band and Black Sport Loop paired with various aluminum cases.
* The media conference, scheduled to kick off at 10am PDT / 1pm EST, will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus. Stay tuned to iDownloadBlog as we’ll be providing continual coverage before, during and after the event.
