* The rumors were true: Apple today announced the new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus which can be ordered beginning tomorrow ahead of scheduled launch this Friday.
* The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition is quite a mouthful name, but these are same phones like before in the same beautiful glass enclosure except for their stunning red finish, matching aluminum band and sleek black front.
* Apple’s press release cited Greg Joswiak, Vice President of Product Marketing:
* This special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone features a stunning red and black color combination and also offers customers the opportunity to make an impact in fighting the spread of HIV and AIDS.
* iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus improve on everything we love about iPhone, including Retina HD displays that are more beautiful than ever, the most powerful and smartest chip ever in a smartphone with the A11 Bionic and more advanced cameras for unbelievable photos and videos. We are proud to support (RED) with this bold new iPhone and hope customers think it is as special as we do.
* They’ll be available to order online in select countries and regions tomorrow after 5:30am PDT. The phones will start delivering to customers and arriving in stores, as follows:
* Not unlike similar (PRODUCT)RED initiatives, every iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED purchase contributes to the Global Fund that provides testing, counseling and treatment for tens of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS. Apple has donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund, serving as the organization’s largest corporate donor.
