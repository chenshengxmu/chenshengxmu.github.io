* Welcome back to our 2017 Holiday Gift Guide. As you can glean from the title, today’s guide focuses on gift ideas for iPhone users. Whether the person you’re shopping for just got a new iPhone X, or has an older model, we’ve rounded up some great products that pair wonderfully with the handset.

* Who said a smart home had to be expensive? At less than $30, this smart plug from Koogeek makes the perfect iPhone accessory and Christmas gift. Simply plug it into an outlet, sync it with your Wi-Fi network, and connect your favorite lamp or appliance. It’s super easy to set up, and because it supports Apple’s HomeKit platform, you can tap your lights on or off, or simply say “Siri, lights off.”

* If the person you’re shopping for has an iPhone 8 or newer, or a compatible Android handset, a wireless charging pad makes for a great gift—even if they already have one, extra chargers are always welcome! I particularly like the Boost Up from Belkin because of its slim profile, anti-slip surface, and support for the iPhone’s faster 7.5w charging speed.

* I really like this portable, rugged Bluetooth speaker from Edifier. It’s lightweight, water/dust proof, and sounds incredible for its tiny size. I know that sounds like a marketing tag line, but it’s true—this speaker sounds so good that it replaced my previous one attached to my hiking bag. And to top it all off, the MP200 is made by veteran audio company Edifier and it comes with a two year warranty.

* It shouldn’t be hard to sell you on why the Apple Watch makes a great gift for iPhone owners. In addition to health tracking and push notifications, the latest version of the wearable features built-in LTE, so you can make phone calls, send messages and even stream music without the need for a nearby iPhone. I realize this makes for a pricey gift, but given the fitness implications alone, I think it’s worth it.

* I know touchscreen gloves don’t scream “awesome gift,” but trust me when I say they can (and likely will) come in handy. I know there are a lot of these out there, but having tried these from Mujjo, I felt comfortable recommending them. They are super soft, very warm, and because they have silver coated nylon fibers woven into ALL of the fabric, every part of the glove works on your touchscreen.

* For the child at heart on your list, I recommend the Spark drone from DJI. When they first burst on the scene a few years ago, the thought was drones were going to be a quick-passing fad. But here we are in 2017, and they are as popular as ever. I really like the Spark for its ultra portable size and incredible video/image quality. Plus it’s extremely easy to fly using hand gestures, your iPhone, or DJI’s controller.

* I usually don’t recommend giving phone cases as gifts—they’re highly personal—but I’ll make an exception here. A wallet case can be used every day, or for that special occasion when you can’t or don’t want to take a separate wallet. I particularly like this one from HEX because it’s made of premium leather and has a classy, minimal design. Inside the folio cover there are 3 credit card slots and a pocket for cash.

* Want an outside-of-the-box gift idea? Check out the Lifeprint portable printer. This lightweight, wireless printer can turn your Instagrams and other photos into beautiful 2×3 images in an instant. But that’s not its only trick. Through the magic of augmented reality, Lifeprint can make your photos come to life using AR tech and a smartphone app. It’s tough to explain, you just have to trust me that it’s awesome.

* I could probably find a reason to put AirPods in every one of our gift guides (and I may do that), but I think they are particularly fitting for iPhone. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a customer being dissatisfied with these headphones. They sound great, fit comfortably in most ears, and pairing with the iPhone is a breeze. Plus they work great with Siri and include a beautiful, charging carrying case.

* I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, battery packs always make great gifts. But you don’t want to get that plastic one in the checkout line at the grocery store. Get one from a trusted name with a high capacity, like this one from Aukey. This 26500mAh pack is capable of recharging an iPhone 8 10 times, it has 3 USB-A ports, as well as USB-C and Lightning, and it comes with a two-year warranty.
