* It seems like every couple of weeks, a new study comes out telling us who the most valuable brand in the world is based on various metrics. The winner changes from time to time, but I’d guess more times than not in recent years, it’s been Apple.
* That’s not that case, however in the latest study. Marketing research firm Millward Brown is out with its annual BrandZ study this morning, and after sitting at the top for 3 years in a row, the iPad-maker has been usurped by Google for the #1 spot…
* Here’s a breakdown of the top 10 companies from Millward Brown’s report (via BusinessInsider):

* “Google has been extremely innovative this year with Google Glass, investments in artificial intelligence and a range of partnerships,” said Benoit Tranzer, the head of Millward Brown France.
* Google Glass is Internet-linked eyewear for which the firm has joined hands with Luxottica, a frame giant behind Ray-Ban and other high-end brands, to sell the new product in the United States.
* “All these activities send a very strong signal to consumers about the essence of Google,” Tranzer said.
* The study points to a 40% increase in Google’s value this year, up to $158 billion from $113 billion in 2013. Apple’s brand value, on the other hand, declined 20%—a move that Millard Brown believes signals a lack of innovation by the Cupertino firm.
* Other tech companies saw significant change this year in ranking. Microsoft jumped to the #4 spot with a 20% increase, and Facebook climbed to #21 thanks to a 68% increase in its brand value. Samsung also grew, moving up to #24 with a 21% jump.
* Again, it’s worth noting that this is just a single report. In fact, Apple has taken the top spot in other recent brand studies, all of which use different metrics than Millward Brown. The data does, however, provide a fair top-down look at current trends.
