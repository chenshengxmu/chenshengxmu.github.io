* Although the jailbreak is undoubtedly going through one of those lull periods amid the iOS 11 release, that’s not to say jailbreak developers aren’t still making tweaks.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the jailbreak tweaks that are new to Cydia as of this past week. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites and outline the rest of them afterward.

* SwitcherXI brings some of the aesthetics of the iOS 11 App Switcher to jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* For those looking to mimic the iOS 11 experience on their jailbroken device, it’s a great tweak to add to your collection. While it’s not a carbon-copy of the iOS 11 App Switcher experience, the minor details it provides will help add to the convincingness of your attempt to fool your friends into thinking you’re running iOS 11 instead of iOS 10.
* We go more in-depth with the SwitcherXI tweak in our full review, so we recommend that you check it out!

* Tooth is a new jailbreak tweak that integrates your Bluetooth devices with Activator actions so that you can easily connect, disconnect, and toggle their connections individually.
* If you have a lot of Bluetooth devices, then you should probably be prepared to use a lot of Activator gestures. Nevertheless, it makes it easier to switch between specific Bluetooth devices on the fly without needing to visit the Bluetooth preference pane in the Settings app each time to do so.
* In our full review, we cover the concept of Tooth in depth, so we encourage you to check that review out!
* HideReminderSearchView: Hides the search bar from the top of the Reminders app (free – review)
* iPAd Support for Whatsapp: Brings native iPad support to the WhatsApp Messenger app (free)
* Tooth (Free): Brings intelligent Activator-driven Bluetooth connection management to iOS for up to two devices (free – review)
* UpsideBoard: Enables you to turn your SpringBoard upside-down (free – review)
* That just about wraps it up for this Sunday’s roundup, but remember to stay tuned to iDownloadBlog throughout the week to learn about all the latest jailbreak tweak releases as they surface.
