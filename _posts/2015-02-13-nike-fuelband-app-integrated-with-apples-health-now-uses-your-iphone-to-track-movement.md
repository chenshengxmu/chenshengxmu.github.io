* It only took, what, five months, but Nike’s FuelBand application for the iPhone was finally refreshed Friday, adding much-needed integration with Apple’s HealthKit platform. As a result, a dedicated FuelBand accessory is no longer required to track your activity or earn Fuel points, your iPhone now does this.
* To reflect this change in direction, the app has been rebranded and is now being marketed as just Nike+ Fuel.
* In addition to getting more insight into your activity in iOS 8’s Health app, HealthKit integration makes your Fuel points visible in and accessible by other apps.
* NikeFuel, “a metric that helps you get active and stay motivated,” now measures your movement in a day via the iPhone 5s, which first debuted power-friendly movement tracking with its M7 motion coprocessor, or newer.
* After enabling sharing with Apple’s Health app inside Nike+ Fuel, your Fuel points will get logged in your Health database and be accessible to other apps.

* And if you connect Nike+ Fuel to other Nike apps like Nike+ Running and Nike+ Training Club or third-party ones such as IFTTT, Withings and more, you’ll earn Fuel points from those activities as well and have them ready inside Apple’s Health.
* Another new feature, Sports Feed, lets you get cheers from friends and share your achievements on Nike+, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

* Lastly, you can add more friends through the streamlined friend search and cheer them on to achieve their goals. For those wondering, Apple’s HealthKit from the onset supported Nike+ Fuel as a fitness metric inside the Health app.
* The 42.6-megabyte download requires an iPhone with iOS 7.1 or later.
* Download Nike+ Fuel for free in the App Store.
