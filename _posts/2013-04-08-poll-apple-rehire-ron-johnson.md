* Apple’s former SVP of Retail Ron Johnson just got booted as the CEO of JC Penney over dismal earnings and for failing to sprinkle a little bit of Apple’s magic dust to fix the retailer’s depressing mid-range brick-and-mortar department store biz.
* And in a fitting twist of fate, it just so happens that Apple, where Johnson spent a decade refining the retail experience which is epitomized in the Genius Bar concept, has been struggling to find a suitable replacement to Johnson for nearly two years now.
* We’re asking you to take a moment, asses the situation and make an educated guess as to whether Tim Cook should make an offer to Johnson or just ignore him in order not to send the wrong kind of message, that people can leave Apple on a whim resting assured the company would always take them back…
* OK, let’s hear you out.
* Cast your vote now.
* Should Apple make an offer to Ron Johnson?
* Feel free to share your two cents with others down in the comments.
