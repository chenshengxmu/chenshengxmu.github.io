* It’s been well over a month since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus officially touched down in retail stores, and even longer since iOS 8 became available. Still, as seems to be the case with each new major iPhone and iOS release, there are developers who take a while when it comes to updating their apps.
* Sometimes the delays are legitimate—updates aren’t easy—and sometimes it seems like the delays are extended with little reason. Whatever the case may be, it makes for a less-than-desirable experience on the user end. With a device like the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus, such delays are especially glaring, because the apps that haven’t be updated stand out like a sore thumb.
* With that in mind, wouldn’t it be nice if you could force an app that hasn’t been updated to run as if it had? That’s the underlying premise behind ForceGoodFit. It forces apps that haven’t been updated to fit the screen resolution of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It basically makes apps that haven’t been update look much better than they did before.
* Have you been looking for a good reason to jailbreak your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus? Then look no further.
* I really don’t have to say much about ForceGoodFit to sell you on it. Just look at the video and the comparison screenshots below.

* The SportsCenter app. Left = normal app, right = app with ForceGoodFit
* All you do is venture into the tweak’s settings, and switch on the apps that you want to apply ForceGoodFit to. After you respring, you’ll find an app that looks much more pleasing to the eyes. Case in point, Reeder:

* I really don’t think I need to say more. ForceGoodFit doesn’t work for every app, but it works for enough apps that it makes it totally worth the download. Oh, and did I mention it’s free?
* What do you think? Is this reason enough to jailbreak your device? Sound off below.
