* As we look into the next three to four weeks, it is expected Apple will release three updated handsets. Two of these devices will likely boast an OLED screen, the iPhone X and X Plus. Additionally, the 6.1″ device will include an edge-to-edge LCD screen with an LED backlit panel.
* All three of these devices will be able to offer incredible contrast ratios, taking advantage of true black wallpapers. Naturally, the OLEDs will do the best job at replicating true black, but make sure to grab this 15 wallpaper pack for now, and later. 
* If you want to make your own true black wallpapers, you should try the OLEDify Pure Black Wallpapers on the App Store. This tool allows you to upload images and then transition the darker parts into true black. Here is an example of a smaller image with a gray background, cropped for iPhone X and converted to true black, using the app. Bonus, here is the optimized lego head wallpaper for iPhone.

* The first image is created by iDB fan favorite AR72014 [gallery]. He is an incredible wallpaper artist and you can follow his creations on Twitter via @AR72014. He is constantly posting amazing images that he designs himself.
* All of the following 14 images were pulled from /r/amoledwallpapers. Consequently, there is not really a theme among the images, other than the backgrounds are true #000000 black. Also, their sizes are a bit random; however, since the background is black, you will be able to scale the image when you set it as wallpaper on your device. It will not be possible to see the image edge, given the black background.
