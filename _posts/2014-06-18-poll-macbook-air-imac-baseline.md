* Apple is taking some heat over its $200 cheaper baseline iMac, which released this morning. See, in order to bring the price down to an attractive $1.099, the iPhone maker has sadly skimped on the specs.
* This $200 saving translates into half the hard drive storage and a slower Intel CPU/integrated graphics.
* Specifically, the entry-level 21.5-incher packs basically the same dual-core 1.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor and integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000 as the MacBook Air family. And with recent MacBook Air price drops, choosing between the all-in-one and one of ultra-portable Airs is anything but trivial.
* That’s why I’ve created a quick poll, so we could learn from your opinion. Tell us which one, in your opinion, is a better buy: a $1,099 iMac or a $1,099 MacBook Air…
* Pictured top of post: the new $1,099 baseline 21.5-inch iMac.
* Below: Apple’s MacBook Air lineup, refreshed on April 29, 2014 and a $100 cheaper.
* As you can see, the entry-level 21.5-inch iMac literally shares the same hardware as the Airs, down to a low-end 1.4GHz dual-core Intel i5 processor with three megabytes of L3 cache and integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000.
* According to supposed Geekbench data, switching to a low-end Intel chip has resulted in a significant performance hit as the refreshed iMac is 40 percent slower in multi-core performance than the model it’s replacing (it’s comparable in single-core benchmarks).

* So, which one is a better buy: a MacBook Air or this new baseline iMac?
* Cast your vote below.
* I guess it all comes down to usage scenarios.
* Some folks would gladly sacrifice that full HD display for the Air’s unmatched portability. And if you believe our own Jeff Benjamin, even the 11-inch MacBook Air packs in enough punch for heavy web/social media activities, typical productivity tasks and even video editing.
* Or, you could have it both ways like this guy.

* Others would never trade the comfort of their desktop and the brilliance of that 21.5-inch screen for the Air’s low-quality 11 or 13-inch display, even though the two machines perform nearly identically.
* Note that the iMac has twice the memory of the Air and more base storage (500GB). But the more capacious storage notwithstanding, keep in mind the all-in-one is using much slower hard drives as opposed to the Air’s flash-based storage that makes a world of difference.
* Anyways, I want to hear your opinion on the iMac vs. MacBook Air dilemma so don’t be shy and sound off in the comments.
