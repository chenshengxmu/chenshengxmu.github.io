title: What a 12.9-inch iPad looks like next to an iPad 4, MacBook Air
---
* Earlier this year, a report from a Korean news site claimed that Apple was looking at the possibility of launching a 12.9-inch iPad in early 2014. We called the story ‘crazy,’ as among other things, it called for the monstrous tablet to be named the ‘iPad maxi.’
* Surprisingly, though, late last month the Wall Street Journal corroborated the report, saying it had it on good authority that Apple was really working on such a device. And on the off chance that it ever makes it to market, here’s what it could look like…
* The folks over at MacRumors have commissioned CiccareseDesign to create renderings of what a 13-inch iPad might look like compared to the current iPad and iPad mini models, as well as the rumored fifth-generation iPad, and a 13-inch MacBook Air.
* Here’s the 12.9-inch iPad next to a mini and a 4th gen iPad:

* And here it is next to a 13-inch MacBook Air:

* Now, there’s a lot of math behind this thing, but MacRumors says that the renderings are based on a display with a resolution of 2712 x 2048. That’s why you see an extra row of icons on the Home screen, and why it seems like there’s so much empty space.
* While the renderings look great, the obvious question here is why on earth would Apple build such a large tablet? Isn’t the current 9.7-inch model plenty big—or even too big for folks that opt for the smaller 7.9-inch mini? Honestly, I don’t have an answer.
* But if I had to guess, I’d say such a device would be geared toward the pro crowd—photographers, videographers, producers, etc. Never underestimate the value of more screen real estate when you’re doing things like showing photos and editing raw footage.
* So will we ever see a 13-inch iPad? I don’t know. But if we do, I doubt it will be anytime soon. I agree with some of the chatter I’ve come across on Twitter that iOS, as it is now, would feel rather odd on a 12.9-inch display—as would its thousands of apps.
* What’s your take on all of this? Would you buy a 13-inch iPad?
