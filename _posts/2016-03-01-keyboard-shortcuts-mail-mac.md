* Using keyboard shortcuts is a great way to streamline your workflow in any app, whether it has been preinstalled on your Mac or you’ve downloaded it yourself. With the Mail app being the most popular way to send and receive emails on the macOS platform, it’s a great place to get started with them.
* In this piece, we’ll go over 10 useful Mac Mail keyboard shortcuts you can use to speed up your workflow.
* If you’ve ever needed a quick way to mark a message in your inbox as junk because it wasn’t of any interest to you, don’t bother clicking any buttons. Instead, just press Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + J on your keyboard and the message will turn gold and be marked as junk mail.
* Sometimes you get new emails from people you wish you had in your Contacts app for future reference. To add a sender to your Contacts app, just press Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + Y on your keyboard and you can begin adding the sender to your contact list.
* To quickly refresh your email inbox to look for new mail, press Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + N on your keyboard.
* If you want to copy a formatting style of one part of your email and then paste it to another part of your email, you’ll highlight the text you want to copy the formatting from by pressing Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + C on your keyboard and then you’ll highlight the text you want to paste the formatting to by pressing Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + V on your keyboard.
* To quickly jump to the search field to search for senders or email content, press Command (⌘) + F on your keyboard.
* To quickly search for and attach a file to your email that you are sending, you can press Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + A from your keyboard and select a file from the accompanying interface to send.
* Instead of clicking the Send button when you’ve finished composing your email message content, you can press Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + D on your keyboard and your message will be fired off to the recipient.
* At times you might need to print the contents of an email, which is handy for receipts and letters that you receive. To print out an email quickly from the Mail app, press Command (⌘) + P on your keyboard, select a printer from the pop-up, and click on the “Print” button.
* To make the Mail app full-screen for even more viewing pleasure, press Control + Command (⌘) + F on your keyboard.
* Instead of deleting the junk mail all by yourself, you can press Command (⌘) + Option (⌥) + J on your keyboard and they’ll be cleared from your Mail app so you can focus on the important emails.
* These aren’t the only Mac Mail keyboard shortcuts available to use, but they are some of the most useful in my opinion. All of them can help you to improve your speed and efficiency while composing multiple emails each day.
