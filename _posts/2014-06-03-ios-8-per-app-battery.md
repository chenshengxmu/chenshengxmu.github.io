* iOS 8, when it releases for public consumption this Fall, will make it real easy to identify apps that are battery hogs.
* That’s because among a flurry of new iOS 8 features introduced during the WWDC keynote yesterday was a brand new per-app battery usage indicator in the Settings app.
* It allows you to identify apps that suck your battery dry so you could stop using them and improve your device’s battery performance…
* As the screenshot shared by Evan Coleman on Twitter attests (via MacRumors), General > Usage > Battery Usage in iOS 8 Settings includes a new section titled Battery Usage where you can see battery consumption on a per-app basis.
* Apple says it shows “proportion of battery used by each app” as a percentage, when your device is not charging. There are two buttons here allowing you to see your apps’  battery usage in the Last 24 Hours or Last 7 Days.
* Of course, those who’ve just installed iOS 8 beta on their device(s) will have to wait a couple days before the Last 7 Days option yields tangible results.

* Notably absent is a switch to determine apps’ battery usage since last charge or during the lifetime of the device for that matter.
* Still, it’s a useful addition that will come in handy in iOS 8 a lot and here’s why.
* As Apple confirmed during the keynote, iOS 8 allows for new situations in which apps could monopolize system resources. See, by making iOS 8 more open to developers, Apple has opened the door to stuff like third-party keyboards, Notification Center widgets, Camera plugins for photo and video effects and various other app extensions.
* Without the new battery feature, it would be impossible for users to identify which of the recently installed apps/extension are destroying your battery.
* How do you like this feature?
