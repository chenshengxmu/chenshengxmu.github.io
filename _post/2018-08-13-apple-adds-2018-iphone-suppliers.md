* With probably about a month to go before the big reveal, Apple has certified all the key component suppliers for this year’s iPhones. As such, these suppliers are now in the process of shipping large component qualities, including camera lenses, metal chassis, and other parts to Apple’s larger manufacturers such as Foxconn, according to Economic Daily News.
* The Monday report says Fubon Securities and Foxconn will assemble every second-generation 5.8-inch iPhone X, 90 percent of the units for the so-called 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus,” and 75 percent of the total for the long-rumored 6.1-inch LCD iPhone. Taiwan-based Pegatron is fulfilling the remaining orders during this cycle.
* Apple’s likely to announce and release all three new 2018 iPhones next month. However, according to Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, the LCD model could be delayed until October.
* Previous rumors have said starting prices for this year’s smartphones should be $699 for the LCD model, $899 for the second-generation iPhone X, and $999 for the iPhone X Plus. All three new phones are expected to include Face ID and a True-Depth camera system and feature some new color combinations.
* Last week, CNET suggested Apple’s fall event could be held as early as Sept. 12. Apple should send out press invitations for the event no later than the last week of August.
* Besides new iPhones, Apple’s upcoming press event should see the introduction of new iPad Pro models and the launch of a fourth-generation Apple Watch. New Macs are also likely to make an appearance.
