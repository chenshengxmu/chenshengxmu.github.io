* Today was the day that the results of the 2015 Jailbreak Awards were unveiled, and we’re happy to say that iDB was the winner in both categories that we were nominated for. Not only did you help vote iDB as the best jailbreak-oriented blog, but you also selected us as having the best jailbreak-related YouTube Channel.
* It’s an honor to be so highly thought of in the community, and we’d like to take this time to thank you for reading, watching, and voting for us. Check the rest of this post for a list of all of this year’s winners.
* Again, thank you for participating. We look forward to living up to your sentiments in 2016.
