* We told you back in March that developer Fireaxis and publisher 2K Games will be releasing the official XCOM: Enemy Unknown port on the App Store this summer. Today, the publisher has confirmed both the released date and price: XCOM: Enemy Unknown is coming to an iPhone and iPad near your on June 20, costing twenty bucks.
* Basically a re-imagined remake of the 1994 cult classic strategy game UFO: Enemy Unknown (also known as X-COM: UFO Defense), XCOM: Enemy Unknown puts you in the shoes of an elite multinational paramilitary organization which must get rid of the alien scum invading the Earth…
* Gamespot was able to confirm the June 20 release date with both Fireaxis and 2K Games. The $20 universal binary will support the iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and the fifth-gen iPod touch.
* It includes GameCenter support and makes use of iCloud functionality, allowing players to save games across every iOS device they own.
* Head-to-head multiplayer mode will be added later as a free update.
* Here’s a trailer from March 2012.
* XCOM: Enemy Unknown previously launched in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Late April, UK developer Feral Interactive released XCOM: Enemy Unknown – Elite Edition on the Mac App Store.
* Lead Designer Jake Solomon told Jostiq that this will be a full-blown release, not some free-to-play junk that constantly asks for cash.
* It’s going to be priced appropriately for what it is. It’s going to be a premium price point. It is the game. It is the full game.
* The publication also learned that the game won’t include the Slingshot pack downloadable content, although the Elite Soldier DLC will be allegedly included.
* Anyway, if you’re a fan of the genre, twenty bucks may not be too high a price to pay to have that premium experience on your iDevice.
