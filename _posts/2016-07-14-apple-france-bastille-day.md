* France is celebrating Bastille Day today and Apple has joined the festivities with a clever use of imagery from its award-winning ‘Shot on iPhone’ ad campaign on the Apple France homepage. The company carefully selected a batch of images from the campaign with predominant blue, white and red tones, and used them smartly on its website to form a basis for the French national flag colors.
* In a typical Apple fashion, flag sections automatically cycle through their respective blue, white and red-tinted photos. Plus, each image is appropriately credited at the bottom with the name of the person who took it.
* Clicking any image inside the flag takes visitors to the iPhone 6s Camera section.
* The commemoration extends to huge billboards in various locations around France.
