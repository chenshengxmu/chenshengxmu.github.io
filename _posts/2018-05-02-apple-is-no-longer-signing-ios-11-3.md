* Apple has stopped signing iOS 11.3 on Wednesday, a move that prevents iPhone and iPad users from downgrading or restoring to this particular version of iOS through iTunes.
* The Cupertino-based company regularly stops signing older iOS versions just a couple of weeks after releasing a new software update. Given how Apple just released iOS 11.3.1 a little more than a week ago, this news shouldn’t come as much of a surprise.
* The latest jailbreak tool for iPhones and iPads only supports iOS 11.0-11.1.2, so this change doesn’t impact the jailbreak community very much. Instead, it serves as simple software-centric planned obsolescence.
* Most software updates contain bug fixes and software refinements, so it’s not too shocking that Apple wants to have more of its user base running the latest version of iOS. This is just one way that the company can force more people to upgrade, whether they want to or not.
* As always, you can track which versions of iOS are being signed for your device from the ever-so-useful IPSW.me website. You can also download relevant firmware files from the downloads page on iDownloadBlog.
* Which version of iOS are you currently running? Let us know in the comments section below.
