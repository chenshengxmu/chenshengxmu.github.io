* Facebook’s Paper for iPhone app has been refreshed today with improved performance as well as faster way of sharing photos, in addition to fixing a few issues “you’ve let us know about.”
* When sharing photos, your Camera Roll items are now organized by date. Even better, the app now supports the new Favorites album introduced in iOS 8 which collates the images you’ve favorited by tapping on the heart icon in the iOS Photos app.
* Your Favorites album can now be selected when sharing a photo in Paper, by tapping on the album selection option at the top of the screen.

* It’s also handy that Paper now shows your Camera Roll photos and videos organized by the date they’re taken.
* Previously, the items got sorted randomly and it was driving me nuts. Lastly, the app does appear to be a little faster and more responsive than before.
* Paper 1.2.5 changelog:
* The iPhone-only app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Paper for free in the App Store.
