* Those encouraging Apple to introduce a less-pricey iPhone to compete against Android in places such as China have even more ammunition.
* In a David and Goliath tale, a tiny Chinese company armed with a sub-$100 smartphone is outselling Apple’s iPhone, prompting some local observers to wonder whether the California-based gadget maker can ever overcome inexpensive rivals.
* From analysts to former Apple CEOs come recommendations that the company do more to attract China’s middle class, now drawn to Android devices. While Apple reportedly considers offering a cheaper iPhone starting at $99 later this year, the Android-based Coolpad is already outselling the iPhone in China and at one-fifth the price of current iPhones…
* According to Bloomberg, the Coolpad sells for less than $99. Its maker, China Wireless Technologies Ltd., is expecting 28 million sales, a 40 percent increase over 2012.
* Meanwhile, Apple searches for an answer to the Chinese puzzle, the company’s standing dropping to six from fourth-place.
* Coolpad has “had strong sales volume and revenue because our company is focused on the low end of the Chinese market,” China Wireless finance chief Jiang Chao told Bloomberg.
* Apple is “unlikely to rank high as long as the general level of affluence in China is low,” Singapore-based analyst Magdalene Choong of Phillip Securities, told Blomberg.
* And this is Verizon finance boss Fran Shammo and his take on why 50 percent of iPhone activations on the Verizon network during Q4 2012 were older iPhone 4/4S models (via WSJ):
* You had a very low entry point for people to come in on an iPhone that quite honestly never had that ability on the Verizon Wireless network before.
* It is a price-point issue for consumers.
* And Piper Jaffray’s resident Apple analyst Gene Munster:
* Perhaps we’re getting to the last third of people who are buying smartphones, and they’re more price-sensitive.
* Earlier this month, former Apple CEO John Sculley said the company needs to price products “that the emerging middle class in Asia, for example, can afford”.
* Sounds good.
* Another excuse for a more affordable iPhone: while overall smartphone shipments are expected to increase by 28 percent this year, in China, smartphone sales are predicted to increase by 44 percent.

* As we reported in November, the market for inexpensive phones could double by 2016, according to NPD. According to Gartner, as the number of cheap smartphones increase, the room for high-end products, such as the iPhone, could decrease.
* Even more reason to tune in when Apple releases its fourth-quarter results later today.
* If the company does make an announcement about its plans for China, including a possible inexpensive iPhone, “it will change a lot of market dynamics,” one Hong Kong trader said.
* Do you think Apple needs a sub-$200 no-contract iPhone that doesn’t use 2010 components in order to curb the rumored growth slowdown on the high-end?
