* Hey kids, if you loved The LEGO Movie now is your chance to enjoy the same fun characters and environments in an interactive iPhone and iPad game.
* Released today in the App Store, the LEGO Movie Video Game contains more than 90 characters from the film and over 40 missions. It’s a classic LEGO fun so you’ll get to build your own virtual LEGO creations using the Master Builders.
* The player guides a builder named Emmet who got drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an “epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously underprepared.”
* The storyline is just an excuse for solving various puzzles and creating your own environments using LEGO bricks.
* Before you set out to build your own Master Builder creations, you’ll need to collect some blueprints in the form of LEGO instruction pages.

* As mentioned before, The LEGO Movie Video Game includes over 90 characters from the film like, including Batman, Superman, the Green Ninja, Gandalf and Benny, to name but a few.
* From the technical standpoint, the app packs in crisp visuals, attractive cinematics and pretty nicely animated characters and environments.
* Key highlights:
* Despite it being a premium release, Warner Bros. just couldn’t resist throwing in optional In-App Purchases that cost real money. Topping it all off is in-game advertising for Warner products and services.
* To celebrate the game’s launch, they’re offering (for a limited time) the “Confetti” and “Bubble” Red Brick abilities at no cost via the In-App Purchase mechanism.
