* iOS 6 beta dropped a few hours ago, and while some of us – including me – are struggling to get it installed, others like iDB reader @aligee97 are busy digging into the beta firmware.
* And some little gems have already been uncovered. New in iOS 6 is the ability to set a song as your alarm…
* Instead of choosing a ringtone like you can currently do in iOS 5, you can tell your iDevice to pick a song from your music library.
* Of course, those of us who jailbreak are no stranger to this simple feature, but it’s nice to see Apple finally baking it straight into iOS.
* Let us know if you find anything else new in iOS 6!
