* iOS 11 adoption rate has overtaken that of iOS 10 this week as the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system is now installed on about 48% of iOS devices. In comparison, iOS 10 is still installed on about 45% of devices, according to analytics firm Mixpanel.
* Older operating system versions, including iOS 9, iOS 8 and below, represent approximately 6% of the install base.
* iOS 11 adoption rate is slightly slower than iOS 10’s. In the same time frame last year, iOS 10 was already installed on roughly 58% of devices, while iOS 9 was installed on only 31% of devices.
* These numbers are obviously not official numbers shared directly by Apple, but they’ve proven to paint a relatively good picture of the state of iOS versions adoption in the past.
