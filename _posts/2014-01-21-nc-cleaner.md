* NC Cleaner is a brand new jailbreak tweak that does one thing, and one thing only: It allows you to remove the Yahoo branding that appears in the bottom of Notification Center’s Today view in iOS 7.
* If you have a special hatred for the Yahoo branding, then this is one of the tweaks that you can use to get rid of it. We’ve got a before and after comparison video inside for you to check out.
* As you might imagine, NC Cleaner is totally an install and go affair. There are no options or settings to configure, so if you want the Yahoo branding back, you’ll need to uninstall the tweak.
* Head over to Cydia to download it now if you want to give it a try. It is, of course, a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
