* Pandora is great, but there are times when you don’t feel like being told what to listen to, and you know exactly what you want to hear. For times like these, Spotify is best suited for your needs. The point is, both apps have strong points—Pandora is best for music discovery, while Spotify is best for playing exactly what you want to hear.
* Wouldn’t it be great if these two apps could join forces and take on the evilness that is silence? Indeed! That’s what Hashbang productions had in mind when it created this new tweak. Have a look inside to see how RadiSpot works.
* Once installed, you’ll notice a new “Open in Spotify” button nestled inside of Pandora’s sidebar menu. Taping this button while a song is playing will open up the search results of the same song in Spotify.

* RadiSpot if a simple concept, but it’s executed well, and is quite original to boot. I can tell you that I will be using this tweak going forward, and I hope that Hashbang keeps iterating and improving the tweak with new features, options, etc.
* If you’re a Pandora and Spotify user, and you’d like to check it out for yourself, then venture over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo and download it free of charge. After that, tell us how you liked it in the comments down below.
