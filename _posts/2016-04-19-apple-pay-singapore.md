* Through launch partnership with American Express, customers in Singapore can now take advantage of Apple’s mobile payment system to pay for goods and services in stores with a touch of their finger. Adding Singapore to the list of countries that support Apple Pay was advertised earlier today on the local Apple Pay website in Singapore.
* Local retailers like FairPrice, Starbucks, TopShop, TopMan, StarHub, Shaw Theaters and several others will now take Apple Pay as a form of payment. In the coming months, outlets like 7 Eleven, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Food Republic and Toast Box will roll out support for Apple Pay in the 5.4 million people country.
* Apple’s website states that support for Visa cards for Apply Pay customers in Singapore is coming soon. According to a recently leaked MasterCard roadmap, Apple Pay should launch later this year in Japan, Brazil and Hong Kong.
* Apple’s Jennifer Bailey has confirmed the expansion to Singapore in a statement:
* Starting today, Apple Pay is available for eligible American Express issued credit cards in Singapore, so customers can now pay in an easy, secure, and more private way.
* We’re also thrilled that credit and debit cards from Singapore’s most popular banks, including DSB, UOB, and Standard Chartered will work with Apple Pay in the coming months – so even more people can experience the best way to pay from their iPhone, Apple Watch or iPad.
* With today’s expansion, Apple Pay is now available in a total of six major markets: The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Australia, China and Singapore.
* The official iOS 9 Feature Availability webpage on Apple’s website did not reflect at the time of this writing that Apple Pay had launched in Singapore, but we expect it to be refreshed in a matter of hours. Apple’s support document that lists financial institutions which support Apple Pay acknowledges the service’s expansion to Singapore.
