* Reuters is reporting tonight that the US Department of Justice could file a lawsuit against Apple as early as tomorrow morning over its iBook Store. The store utilizes an ‘agency’ model, which allows publishers to name their own eBook prices.
* The DOJ believes that Apple is acting in concert with a number of publishers, who have recently raised their eBook prices across multiple platforms, to raise prices across the industry — which happens to be a violation of federal antirust laws…
* “The Just Department is investigating alleged price-fixing by Apple and five major publisher: CBS Corp’s Simon & Schuster Inc, HarperCollins Publishers Inc, Lagardere SCA’s Hachette Book Group, Pearson and Macmillion, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH. A lawsuit against Apple, one of the parters not in negotiations with the Justice Department for a potential settlement, could come as early as Wednesday but no final decision has been made, the people said.”
* Last month we heard word that publishers were working with the DOJ to reach an out-of-court settlement, but it appears Apple was not a participant. It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out, as it could have huge ramifications for Apple’s iBook Store.
