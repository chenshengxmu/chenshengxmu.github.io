* The iPhone 4S has been a tremendous success for all three of the US carriers that currently sell the handset. But it seems that AT&T is getting a little more success compared to Apple’s other two iPhone 4S partners.
* AT&T today announced that it has activated more than one million iPhone 4S devices as of Tuesday, making the iPhone 4S launch the most successful launch in the carrier’s history… 
* President and CEO of AT&T Mobility Ralph de la Vega claims the reason for this success is AT&T’s HSPA+ network speeds:
* “AT&T was the first carrier in the world to launch iPhone in 2007 and is the only U.S. carrier to support iPhone 4S with 4G speeds.
* “It’s no surprise that customers are clamoring for iPhone 4S and they want it to run on a network that lets them download twice as fast as competitors’,” said Ralph de la Vega, President and CEO, AT&T Mobility & Consumer Markets.”
* He may very well be right, as Sprint owners have been complaining about slow 3G data speeds ever since the launch of the iPhone 4S. Additionally, AT&T’s GSM/HSPA+ network allows for simultaneous voice and 3G data on the iPhone, while Verizon and Sprint CDMA networks are not capable of this.
* Check out the video below from AT&T of why customers choose their network for the iPhone 4S:
* As Horace Dediu points out, AT&T only activated 16% of all iPhones sold last quarter, which is a new low. AT&T was responsible for 37% of the US iPhone market this time last year.
