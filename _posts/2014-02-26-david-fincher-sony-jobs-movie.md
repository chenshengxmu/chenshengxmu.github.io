* If you fancy yourself any kind of Apple fan, or movie fan, you have to be excited about Sony’s upcoming biopic of Steve Jobs. Not only is it being written by Academy Award-winner Aaron Sorkin, but it’s now being rumored that David Fincher has signed on to direct the film.
* Fincher directed the hit Facebook flick ‘The Social Network,’ which Sorkin also wrote, and also directs and produces Netflix’s critically-acclaimed drama House of Cards. So needless to say, adding him to the production team of the Jobs biopic would be a major move for Sony…
* Hollywood Reporter has the scoop:
* “David Fincher already has tackled one Silicon Valley billionaire in Mark Zuckerberg. Now, the Social Network director is poised to take on the late Steve Jobs for Sony.
* Fincher is in early talks to helm the untitled film based on Walter Isaacson’s best-selling biography of the Apple co-founder, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. If a deal comes together, the film would reunite the director with Oscar-winning Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin, who recently finished the adaptation, and Social Network producer Scott Rudin. Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady also are producing.”
* Fincher is a notoriously picky director, who can go years between feature projects. The last movie he directed was The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which was released in 2011. The film was well received, grossing $200 million worldwide, but its planned sequels have been shelved.
* Last month, it was reported that Aaron Sorkin had finished and turned in his screenplay for the Jobs feature. The writer has said little about the movie outside of commenting that he was thinking about doing just three 30-minutes scenes, showing backstage before product announcements.
* Jobs’ life already inspired one major film: Open Road’s 2013 ‘Jobs,’ starring Ashton Kutcher. There’s no word yet on who is set to play Jobs in Sony’s picture, but the fact that high-profile names like Sorkin and Fincher are attached, should give them several A-list stars to choose from.
