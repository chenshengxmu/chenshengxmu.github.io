* Apple has seeded a new beta build of iOS 8.2 to developers on Tuesday, marking the fifth build of the software.
* The new software, build number 12D5480a, is available to download over-the-air and should be available through the Developer Center soon. Apple claims the new beta “contains bug fixes and improvements.”
* It also adds Xcode 6.2 beta 5 with WatchKit, which allows developers to start creating applications for the Apple Watch, ahead of its release in April. The new Xcode brings the latest WatchKit tools to developers.
* Like with all software releases, Apple hasn’t provided any word on when it may be released to the public. iOS 8.2 beta 4 was seeded to developers in mid-January. Given that iOS 8.2 unlocks many features of the Apple Watch, like support for apps, it will probably be released to the public around the time of the smartwatch’s debut.
* We’ll be tracking any changes the software may bring – and you can help us! Email tips@iDownloadBlog.com with any new changes. More to come.
