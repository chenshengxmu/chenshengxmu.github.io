* It’s that time again! With the release of iOS 4.3.2/4.2.7,  TinyUmbrella developer @notcom has updated the popular utility once again.
* The latest version (4.32.01) brings iOS 4.3.2 (GSM) and iOS 4.2.7 (CDMA) support. Additionally, the new version also comes with a new feature which will automatically take you to the TinyUmbrella website when you’re running an outdated version (although, we’ll always let you know when there’s a new update). 
* Once again, to save your SHSH blobs, all you have to do is connect your iDevice via USB to your computer, launch TinyUmbrella, and click the “Save SHSH” button.
* You can download the newest version of TinyUmbrella from here. The software will run on Windows and OS X.
* Keep in mind, it’s always good to backup your SHSH blobs as they are required to downgrade to previous firmwares Apple is no longer signing.
