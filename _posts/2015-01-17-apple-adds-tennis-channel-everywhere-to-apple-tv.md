* The Apple TV content march continues, as the company has added Tennis Channel Everywhere to the set-top box for tennis lovers.
* Previously just an iOS app, the Tennis Channel Everywhere app on the Apple TV extends its functionality to the larger screen. The app streams live matches for $69.99 per year, or if you don’t feel like paying, highlights from some of the recent matches are available to view for free. Earlier this week, Apple added Cricket Australia to the Apple TV down under.
* While Cricket Australia and Tennis Channel Everywhere don’t necessarily affect many Apple TV owners, it does underscore Apple’s quest to add global and region-specific content to its TV platform. The company has given its set-top box little love since 2012, but it’s added a number of new channels.
* The app should be rolling out to Apple TVs soon.
