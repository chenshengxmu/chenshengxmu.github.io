* To me, it seems like a no-brainer that Apple will address the low-resolution display in the iPad mini by its next-generation. After all, the tablet’s lack of a Retina display has seemingly been the only complaint amidst otherwise extremely positive reviews.
* But no-brainer or not, it’s always nice to hear reports that help back up gut feelings. And the latest one comes out of Taiwan, where a familiar publication has it on good authority that Apple is talking to its suppliers about high-res iPad mini panels…
* The news comes from the infamous hit-or-mit tech gossip site DigiTimes (via MacRumors):
* “Apple’s next-generation iPad mini will focus mostly on enhancing the device’s display resolution, according to Taiwan-based backlighting industry sources.
* The sources have yet to specify whether the device will use Apple’s Retina Display technology to enhanced resolution, but market observers said it is highly likely based on the development of past Apple products such as the iPhone and 9.7-inch iPad series.”
* It’s hard to imagine that Apple would up the iPad mini’s display resolution and not call it Retina, as its become a familiar brand amongst its other product lines. But, giving the mini a full-blown Retina panel at its size could be tough, as seen with the full iPad.
* On that front, the Taiwanese outlet also says that it’s hearing that Apple is working to restructure the lighting of the next-generation 9.7-inch iPad from two LED light bars to one, in an effort to decrease the device’s overall size and weight.
* Admittedly, DigiTimes has a reputation for being unreliable. But if you’re really keeping score, it’s actually quite accurate in this field. For example, it nailed both the iPad mini and the 4th generation iPad earlier this year before either was announced.
* We fully expect to see an iPad mini with a higher resolution display, and a trimmer 9.7-inch iPad from Apple next year. But at this point, there’s no telling when we’ll see them. Spring? Summer? Late fall?
* What do you think?
