* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is adamant that iPhone X’s advanced 3D facial recognition technology based on Apple’s new TrueDepth camera system will make its way into new iPad Pro and iPhone models scheduled to be released next year.
* In his note issued to clients today, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, Kuo writes that all new iPhones released next year (including LCD-based models), as well as 2018 iPad Pros, will have TrueDepth technology.
* We predict iOS devices to be equipped with TrueDepth Camera in fiscal year 2018 will include iPhone X and new 2018 iPhone and iPad models. Because of this, we believe more developers will pay attention to the TrueDepth camera and facial recognition-related applications.
* He hopes Apple will soon launch a major promotion in the United States to popularize Face ID apps, saying increased visibility of the technology may encourage the Android camp to “also dedicate more resources to developing hardware and facial recognition applications.”
* For those wondering, all apps that support with Touch ID will automatically work with Face ID without needing an update.
* Kuo previously said Apple may have an 18 to 30-month advantage over Android rivals in terms of Face ID and related depth-sensing camera sensors.
* Apple’s suppliers are currently seeing poor yield rates in the assembly of the TrueDepth camera, which has reportedly discouraged Android vendors and prompted them to delay plans for their own 3D camera sensors until the first half of 2018.
* Would the TrueDepth camera system make sense on iPads?
* Do chime in with your thoughts in the comments below!
