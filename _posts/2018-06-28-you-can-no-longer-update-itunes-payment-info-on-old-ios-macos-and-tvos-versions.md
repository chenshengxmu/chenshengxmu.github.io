* A payment security update that goes into effect Saturday, June 30, 2018, will prohibit Apple customers who are on older editions of the iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS software from updating their Apple ID payment information used for iTunes and App Stores.
* According to an advisory issued yesterday, the change affects folks on very old versions of Apple’s operating systems powering iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch devices.
* As a result of this security update, customers will no longer be able to change their payment information from devices using the following versions of Apple software:
* Affected customers won’t be allowed to change their payment method directly on their device unless they update to the latest version of the system software.

* According to Apple’s email to customers, these changes are being implemented to continue to “ensure your financial data is protected when you make purchases on iTunes or App Store.”
* On a related note, Apple on May 25, 2018 implemented changes that prevent Windows XP and Vista PC customers and owners of the first-generation Apple TVs from using iTunes Store, making new purchases or redownloading previous purchases.
* To make purchases from iTunes Store and redownload previous purchases, PC users should upgrade to Windows 7 or later and use the latest available version of iTunes for Windows found at apple.com/itunes/download or in Microsoft Store.
* Thoughts?
