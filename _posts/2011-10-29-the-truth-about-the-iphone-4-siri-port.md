* A few hours ago a video was posted by esteemed jailbreak developer chpwn (Grant Paul) and Steven Troughton-Smith. Multiple stories from different sources have been published on a Siri port for non-iPhone 4S hardware, and this most recent video demonstrates the software running on an iPhone 4 and 4th generation iPod touch.
* There have been multiple parties working on a Siri port on and off for weeks now. It’s not a new fact that the Siri UI can be run on non-4S hardware. The real magic happens when Siri is able to talk back to you…
* As you can see in the above videos, Steven and Grant have been able to get Siri connecting with Apple’s server. Performance is smooth and Siri responds very quickly.
* The first public evidence for a Siri port to the iPhone 4 was posted by Steve Troughton-Smith weeks ago in conjunction with Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac. A second video was posted showing performance enhancements, but Siri would still not connect with the device. Only the Siri UI had been ported, not the full package.
* It’s all changed since then.
* Any type of Siri port for the public is very much not ready for prime time. There’s still a lot of work to be done.
* Update: This article has been heavily amended to better respect all parties involved.
