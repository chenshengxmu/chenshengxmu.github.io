title: How to reclaim your pre iOS 5.1 Lock screen camera functionality

* Redire is a recently released jailbreak tweak that allows you to venture back to the days before Apple changed the Lock screen camera functionality for iOS 5.1.
* It’s extremely simple in both its purpose and execution, and includes no options to configure. After installing Redire your Lock screen camera will function almost exactly like it does on iOS 5 or iOS 5.0.1.
* Check inside for video details of Redire in action…
* The main difference I noticed between Redire and a true iOS 5.0.1 install is that fact that the Lock screen camera button is always present with Redire. On true iOS 5.0.1 devices, the Lock screen camera only appears after a double press of the Home button.
* If you can live with the Lock screen camera always being present, yet wish to reclaim the function of pre iOS 5.1 devices, then Redire is the tweak for you.
* Head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can snag it for free, and be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
