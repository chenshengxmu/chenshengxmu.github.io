* During Apple’s most recent earnings call, Tim Cook cited constrained supplies for the new iPad as a reason its tablet sales were a little off. But that doesn’t seem to be the case any more, as availability continues to improve.
* Just two weeks after we saw iPad shipping estimates drop to 5-7 business days, shipping times have once again decreased. It looks like folks wanting to order a new iPad online will now only have to wait a measly 3-5 days…
* Third-generation iPads in Apple’s online stores for the US, Canada and Mexico all reflect the new 3-5 day window. It also appears to apply to all carrier variations, across every storage model.
* Despite the early supply constraints, Apple has continued to roll out its latest tablet internationally at a staggering pace. The company launched the new iPad in 9 new countries last Friday, making it available in a total of 30 countries worldwide.
