* Apple on Tuesday released iOS 9.3 beta 5 to developers. The update is available for members of Apple’s develop program (and public testing program) either via an OTA update, for those already on iOS 9.3, or as a download from Apple’s dev center.
* Today’s release comes just one week after the previous beta 4, which added a redesigned Night Shift mode icon in Control Center and other under-the-hood improvements, and nearly two months after the original 9.3 beta was pushed to developers.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the iOS 9.3 story, it’s going to be a significant update with several new user-facing features and improvements including Night Shift mode, password-protected Notes, new 3D Touch actions and much more.
* In addition to iOS 9.3, Apple also seeded beta 5 for OS X 10.11.4, watchOS 9.2 and tvOS 9.2. We weren’t able to spot any changes in the watchOS release notes, and the notes for tvOS 9.2 simply say “beta 5 contains bug fixes and general improvements.”
* We are installing these betas now, and will be sure to let you know if we spot any other changes worth mentioning. If you see something notable that we’ve missed, let us know down in the comments section below or email us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
