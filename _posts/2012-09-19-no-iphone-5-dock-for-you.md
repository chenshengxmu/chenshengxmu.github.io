* Starting with the new iPhone, Apple will be replacing the decade-old 30-pin dock connectors in all of its future iOS devices. This means that, sans an adapter, all of your old dock accessories will become obsolete.
* This includes Apple’s white 30-pin dock — a signature accessory that’s been around since the early iPod days. Most folks figured Apple would update it this fall with the new Lightning plug, but apparently that’s not the case…
* 9to5Mac passes along an email from Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller. The message is in response to a question regarding whether or not Apple plans to make an iPhone 5-compatible dock. Here’s the email:

* Of course, there will likely be several third-party options to choose from. Aftermarket 30-pin to Lightning adapters are already showing up on the web. But it’s still kind of weird that Apple decided to get out of the dock business.
* What do you think, are you disappointed the iPhone dock won’t be updated?
