* Spotlight Suggestions, a feature that recommends content from the Internet when searching with Spotlight on an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 9.0+ or a Mac running OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later, has expanded to seven additional markets: Hong Kong, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.
* Counting these regions, Spotlight Suggestions are now available in a total of 26 major markets around the world, listed on Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage.
* iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac owners can take advantage of Spotlight Suggestions in the following countries around the world:
* Unlike Google, which indexes the public Internet suggest queries when you run searches, Spotlight Suggestions are realized through Apple’s partnerships with cherry-picked data providers in order to deliver highly relevant results in an easily digestible format.
* In supported regions, Spotlight Suggestions are available on iOS/OS X in both Spotlight Search and Safari. On the Mac, suggested content in Spotlight Search can be enabled or disabled under System Preferences → Spotlight → Search Results, then tick or untick the box next to “Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look Up”.
* On the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, head to Settings → General → Spotlight Search → Spotlight Suggestions to turn suggested web content in Spotlight Search on or off.
