* The developer behind BrowserChanger and Action Menu Voice is working on a new app called Safari GridTab, which basically shows your opened Safari tabs in a grid.
* It looks like it’s much easier to navigate through the tabs this way. Safari GridTab is still in development but it will hopefully be released soon…
* Would you use Safari GridTab?
