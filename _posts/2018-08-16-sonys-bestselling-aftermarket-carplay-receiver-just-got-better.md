* If you love CarPlay but aren’t fond of burning cash on a brand-new vehicle just to get CarPlay out of the box, consider Sony’s latest receiver featuring a 6.4-inch touchscreen, CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, support for iDatalink Maestro and more.
* The XAV-AX210, as they’re calling it, is basically an improved version of Sony’s highly praised XAV-AX200 aftermarket CarPlay receiver. Thanks to iDatalink Maestro support, customers can take advantage of onscreen buttons to adjust the various vehicle settings, use steering wheel controls and much more—all without CarPlay.
* The device offers hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via Bluetooth, FLAC file format compatibility, a four-channel amplifier, three external camera inputs, support for SiriusXM radio, a built-in CD/DVD player and more.

* In-car receivers won’t win any beauty contests, but you will notice the ergonomically designed rotary volume with machine-cut aluminum top and an integrated button that provides instant access to the optional menu that includes source selections and sound adjustments.
* Pricing and availability will be announced in the Fall.
