* A year following its October 2014 debut in the United States, Apple’s mobile payments service is now available to American Express cardholders in Canada, the company said on Twitter.
* “Cardmembers can earn the same rewards they already enjoy using Amex with Apple Pay,” said the financial services corporation. In addition to the US and UK, where Apple Pay launched this summer, this marks the third country where the service is available.
* Upon adding an eligible American Express card to Apple Pay, Canadian users can use their iPhone 6/6s, iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus running on iOS 9.0 or above, or Apple Watch paired with an iPhone 5 or later, to pay for their purchases in stores that accept contactless payments.
* Some of the supported locations include Apple Stores, Indigo, McDonald’s, Sport Chek, Tim Hortons, Petro Canada and other stores with NFC payment terminals that accept American Express. The official Apple Pay webpage in Canada provides the full list of locations where Apple Pay is accepted in the country.
* Transaction limits may apply. Bank-issued American Express cards, including those issued in partnership with Scotiabank, are not accepted at launch.
* Customers will be able to use the iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad Pro and iPad mini 4 for in-app payments. Eligible cards include the American Express Consumer, Small Business or Corporate Card issued by Amex Bank of Canada.
* Prepaid cards and products, such as the American Express Gift Card, are not eligible for Apple Pay in Canada. The card company ensures customers that its systems can help stop fraud in its tracks upon recording unusual activity in a customer’s spending pattern, as part of its Fraud Protection Guarantee.
* According to Apple, Apple Pay will be arriving to Australia with American Express later this week, before rolling out in Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong next year, also with American Express.
