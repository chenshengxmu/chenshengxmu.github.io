* Attention moviegoers, Fandango has posted a significant update for its iOS client today, bringing the app to version 5.9. The new software has been redesigned for iOS 7, and includes several improvements.
* Among them is the return of a popular feature called ‘Go Now,’ which allows you to quickly find a movie at your local theater and purchase tickets. And Spotlight and Search have both been given makeovers…
* Here is the full 5.9 change log:
* To make your Fandango experience even more exciting, check out the latest updates we’ve tweaked just for you!
* – We’ve updated our app with a new full screen look for iOS7 – Multitasking made easy: you can now watch trailers & purchase tickets right from Spotlight. You can also filter movies in theaters by genre (comedy, family, etc) – Exclusive videos, video galleries; offers & sweepstakes – they’re all at your fingertips – Search is smarter with a new predictive search feature making it easier to look up movies, theaters and people – And by popular demand – we brought back Go Now! Heading to the movies now? Simply tap on Go Now, find a movie at your local theater & purchase your tickets and enjoy!
* I have to say, the update looks great and the app is noticeably easier to use. Also don’t forget that even if you don’t use the Fandango app itself, it’s worth having installed because the service is integrated into Siri.
* On a related note, Apple updated its iTunes Movie Trailers app for iOS 7 on Tuesday, which also works  with Fandago’s service. Anyway, you can find the latest version of Fandango Movies in the App Store, for free.
