* The haptic feedback trend continues with the release of a new free jailbreak tweak called Harp by iOS developer candoizo.
* This tweak generates a soft ‘buzz’ in your hand whenever you interact with your iPhone’s music controls from your Now Playing interfaces in Control Center or on the Lock screen.
* Haptic feedback comes standard on various Android handsets, but Apple is only just beginning to experiment with haptic feedback in a limited number of circumstances on the iPhone, such as in response to 3D Touch gestures. Many have wished this feedback would come to the iPhone too, but we’re not quite there yet. Fortunately, jailbreakers have a way, and Harp is a step forward in that direction.
* Harp can give you a nudge in the palm of your hand any time you do any of the following:
* After installation, a preferences pane is added to the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand and enable or disable the haptic feedback for the volume bar and/or audio scrubber:

* Harp doesn’t add haptic feedback to the music control interfaces of any of your apps themselves, rather it will only be felt when adjusting music controls in Control Center and on the Lock screen, which is an important caveat to keep in mind.
* Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem to matter which app is playing the media. Whether it’s Apple’s stock Music app or a third-party app like Spotify Music, the haptic feedback will be felt in the aforementioned interfaces in any case.
* Harp is just one tweak out of many that brings haptic feedback to the many interfaces in iOS, and if you’re interested in adding haptic feedback to more interfaces on your device, we suggest checking out the following tweaks while you’re at it:
* Harp can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository, and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 iPhones. Obviously, it won’t work on iPads or iPod touches, as a vibration capability is required.
* Note: It doesn’t matter if you have the older vibrator motor or the newer taptic engine, however results are likely to be much smoother-feeling and lighter on the battery if you have the taptic engine.
* Will you be downloading Harp? Share why or why not in the comments below.
