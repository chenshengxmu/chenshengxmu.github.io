* Apple today published four new ads on its YouTube channel that continue to position its iPad Pro tablet as being better than a computer. The four new commercials, running sixteen seconds each, use the tagline “Real Problems… Answered” and appear to be based on typical PC user tweets.
* The videos promote the tablet as a device that’s free of wires, immune to viruses, faster than most laptops and able to run Microsoft Office apps and connect to fast LTE cellular networks.
* Give the new ads a quick watch, then meet us in comments.
* Yes, these videos use real tweets from real people.
* Watch the commercials below and let us know what you think of them in the comments.
* “Your computer could be better than a computer, if your computer was an iPad Pro.”
* “Your computer could get internet without Wi-Fi, if your computer was an iPad Pro.”
* “You could do more with Word, if your computer was an iPad Pro.”
* “You wouldn’t get PC viruses, if your computer was an iPad Pro.”
* Tim Cook, of course, insists that iPad Pro is a real computer.
* “I think if you’re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones,” he said recently.
* Are these ads corny or memorable, do you think?
