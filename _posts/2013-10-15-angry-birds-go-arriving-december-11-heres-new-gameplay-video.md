* Angry Birds maker back in June teased its upcoming Angry Birds-themed kart racing game. Named Angry Birds Go, the game will be set on a 3D Piggy Island and include tons of characters with unique special powers and a fully rendered 3D world.
* Then in August, the Finnish developer released more information, revealing the title will be a tie in with energy drinks maker Red Bull.
* On Tuesday, Rovio gave us a release date and published a gameplay video which shows off game mechanics while revealing a bunch of bird and pig characters from the Angry Birds series. I’ve included the video and a few additional tidbits right after the break…
* Taking a page from Mario Kart, Rovio’s upcoming downhill kart racing game will contain a number of different kart upgrades and power-ups, along with crazy stunt, air tracks and additional goodies, some of which provided as in-app purchase content.
* In Angry Birds Go! you can feel the rush as you fling down the track and go head-to-head in a fast and furious race to the finish line! Look out for treacherous roads, mischievous opponents and unique special powers to put the race leader behind the pack. Plus you can go from homemade soapbox car to a super-fly car by upgrading your ride.
* Check out the gameplay video below.
* Angry Birds Go will be landing on December 11 as a free-to-play download for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10 devices.
* According to Rovio, Angry Birds Go will feature Hasbro’s interactive Telepods toys. Like with Angry Birds Star Wars II, you’ll be able to teleport your favorite karts into the game.
