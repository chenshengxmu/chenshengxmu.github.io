* Apple just answered perhaps the most-asked question in the tech world over the last two years by unveiling the ‘Apple Watch,’ and now there are just two questions left to ask: how much is it, and when can I get it? Tim Cook just announced that the Watch starts at $349, and will be available early next year.
* For now, it sounds like the Apple Watch requires an iPhone for most of its functionality, but the good news is that it supports a wide range of models: iPhone 5, 5c, 5s and of course the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The Watch itself comes in three flavors: Apple Watch, Sport and Edition, with the latter expected to be the most expensive.
