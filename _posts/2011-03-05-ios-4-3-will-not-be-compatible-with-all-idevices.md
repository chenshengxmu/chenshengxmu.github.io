* We’ve gotten questions from readers asking if iOS 4.3 will be compatible with all iDevices. Sadly, the answer is no. The public release of iOS 4.3 that Apple announced at their iPad 2 event will only work on certain iDevice generations.
* Most notably, 4.3 will not be installable on the Verizon iPhone. Because the Verizon iPhone runs on a different baseband and has different bugs to fix, Apple has to release a separate 4.3 build for that device. (Which they haven’t announced yet.)
* Hopefully your iDevice isn’t on the 4.3 incompatibility list…
* Apple is continually innovating, and there always comes that harsh moment when they drop support for their older devices. The iPhone 3G and 1st-2nd gen iPod Touch will not be compatible with iOS 4.3. If you’ve got a 3GS or iPhone 4, you’ll be fine.
* The Verizon iPhone currently runs 4.2.6, and it is unclear as to when Apple will push a 4.3 update that’s compatible with the CDMA baseband.
* We’ll let you know when 4.3 is headed to the Verizon iPhone. Remember, iOS 4.3 will be available for download in iTunes on March 11th for compatible devices.
