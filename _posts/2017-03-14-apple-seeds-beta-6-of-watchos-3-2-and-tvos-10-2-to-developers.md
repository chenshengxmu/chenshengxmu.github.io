* Apple today seeded sixth betas of what would become the tvOS software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV and the watchOS 3.2 software update for Apple Watch with new features like Theater Mode, support for Siri in watchOS apps and other perks.
* tvOS 10.2 beta 6 (build 14W5264a) can be deployed via the Software Update mechanism on any Apple TV with an appropriate configuration profile. watchOS 3.2 beta 6 (build 14V5245a) is available as an over-the-air download via your paired iPhone.
* iOS 10.3 beta 6 (build14E5273a) and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 6 (build 16E189a) both released yesterday to members of the Apple Developer Program.
* watchOS 3.2 brings Theater Mode to Apple Watch via a new toggle in Control Center which disables the Raise to Wake feature and mutes audible alerts.
* According to Apple:
* Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown.
* Be sure to read our full coverage of Theater Mode in watchOS 3.2.
* watchOS 3.2 will also let you control apps via Siri like you can on iOS 10.
* Using Siri, you’ll be able to tell your Apple Watch to send a message, make a payment, book a ride, start a workout, call a contact or search photos in compatible apps.
* Aside from bug fixes and performance improvements, tvOS 10.2 updates scrolling behavior to help you navigate long lists faster than before. Simply do a large swipe on the remote, then swipe on the far right side to navigate specific indexes.
* From Apple’s release notes:
* Scroll views with a lot of content now have a behavior that allows users to scroll through them much more quickly. Several large swipes of the Siri remote will automatically switch into this mode. Additionally, users can swipe on the far right side of the remote to navigate specific indexes. If you see any unexpected behavior in your applications from this feature, please file a bug report.
* tvOS 10.2 also includes support for Apple’s Device Enrollment Program, Expanded Mobile Device Management, the VideoToolbox framework and the new Apple File System (also found in betas of iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4).
* iOS and macOS are available for public testing via Apple’s Beta Software Program.
* We’ll update the article if we encounter any new end-user features.
