* Accessory maker OtterBox makes a compelling range of protective case, sleeves and rugged cases for smartphones and just yesterday they announced a new Preserver series for the iPhone 5, as well as the new iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, the latter featuring full Touch ID support. The two-piece highly protective cases with snap assembly is bound to add discernible bulk and weight to your device.
* In exchange, you’ll get full protection from dust and water. The company says the case can withstand drops from up to 2 meters, or about 6.6 feet, as well as protect your device when fully submerged up to 2 meters deep for as much as 30 minutes…
* The Preserver series has foam cushions inside to protect and hold the device in place inside the case and includes an adjustable lanyard for carrying and tethering. The built-in screen protector protects the display from scratches without inhibiting touch performance.
* The Preserver series appears to be born out of Otterbox’s acquisition of the waterproof case maker LifeProof earlier this year.
* A media release quotes OtterBox CEO Brian Thomas who argues that everyone should think about water-protecting their pricey smartphones as about “70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, and technology is almost as pervasive”.
* We take our smartphones with us everywhere, and OtterBox is dedicated to making these activities as worry-free as possible. The Preserver Series is dependable, seriously waterproof protection that you can trust.
* According to the official specs, the case features a solid plastic frame lined with device-cradling foam and overmolded bumpers to absorb and deflect shock away from the device inside.
* I’m loving this ad.

* Tying with FishTrack on a Preserve-themed fish fight contest is a clever move, OtterBox!
* What’s unclear is how exactly the case protects the iPhone 5s without interfering with Touch ID functionality as covering the Home button would render the capacitive touch sensor useless. The company insists that the case provides access to the Touch ID security feature while keeping the iPhone 5S protected from water and dust.

* If the above press shot is an indication, the built-in screen protector on the iPhone 5s variant (third from the left) doesn’t appear to cover the Touch ID sensor, opening questions concerning the case’s water-proof features.
* Based on its LifeProof acquisition, OtterBox may have tapped its waterproofing technology featured on the Lifeproof Nuud cases.
* The $89.95 Preserver Series is currently available for the iPhone 5 in four different colors (Pistachio, Carbon, Primrose and Glacier) to match your personal tastes, but you can sign up to be notified when the the iPhone 5s/5c versions are available.
* If you ask me, they should make the Preserver available for the iPhone 4/4s, too.
* A version for Samsung’s Galaxy S4 is in the works as well.
