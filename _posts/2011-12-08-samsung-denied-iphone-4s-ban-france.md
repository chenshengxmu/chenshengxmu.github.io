title: Samsung Denied iPhone 4S Ban Request in France
---
* In a new episode of the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Samsung, the Korean electronics giant saw its request for a ban of the iPhone 4S in France denied, as reported by AllThingsD:
* Describing Samsung’s plea for an injunction as a “disproportionate” measure, the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris ruled Samsung must reimburse Apple $134,100 for its legal fees. But it also denied Apple’s request for damages and said Samsung’s infringement lawsuit against its rival can move forward.
* Next episode will be in Milan next week, where the Milan court will be holding a hearing of Samsung’s request to ban the iPhone 4S in Italy.
