* Over  a month ago we started covering the legal battle between Apple and Samsung. The Cupertino company filed a trademark infringement suit against Samsung, claiming that the Korean company copied the hardware and software design of some of their mobile products.
* Since then, Samsung has counter-sued the iPhone makers, also citing patent infringement. Now that the 2 companies have played ‘if you show me yours, I’ll show you mine‘ for the past week, Samsung’s J.K. Shin tells the WSJ his thoughts on the lawsuit…
* Shin, who is president of Samsung’s mobile communications, has enjoyed some serious success lately. The company’s new Galaxy S II smartphone has sold over a million units in its short time on the market and analysts peg the manufacturer as the 2nd leading tablet maker, behind Apple.
* In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this morning, Shin commented on the dispute:
* “We didn’t copy Apple’s design. We have used many similar designs over the past years and it [Apple’s allegations] will not be legally problematic.”
* Though I don’t doubt that Samsung will get little more than a slap of the wrist on this one, I can’t believe Shin can be so nonchalant. Look at the above photo of a Samsung home theatre remote and tell me that it just has a “similar design” to the iPhone 4.
* The dispute between the 2 companies is not only interesting because the Samsung products actually do bear a striking resemblance to Apple’s, but also because the 2 firms are significant partners. Samsung supplies Apple with multiple components for a variety of products, including iPhones.
* It’ll be interesting to see how this one plays out, as typical patent infringements seem to be a stretch of the law. Apple’s case however, actually seems to hold water, so the judge’s ruling could have a significant ripple effect.
* Does Samsung really not have anything to worry about?
