* Last December, PayPal started selling iTunes gift cards and other digital vouchers through its new Digital Gifts Store.
* It’s perhaps the most convenient and hassle-free option to quickly top up your iTunes credit via PayPal, provided you’re in the United States.
* The problem is, every now and then other retailers discount iTunes vouchers.
* Typically, 20 percent off is the best deal you can find and 30 percent or more off is pretty rare, but we’ve never seen a discount of 50 percent or more on iTunes Gift cards.
* Good today only and while supplies last, PayPal is now offering a $10 iTunes Gift card for just five bucks…
* Note: this deal has now expired.
* This offer was first spotted by DealNews.
* First, visit PayPal’s Digital Gifts Store.
* Next, make sure to manually select the $10 option and type “10” into the Value field to redeem the discount. According to the terms of this promotion, you can get up to ten Gift cards, but I’ve seen people reporting hitting a limit of 20 or more before Paypal cut them off.
* If you buy stuff from iTunes, this is the perfect opportunity to top up your credit for half price because you’re essentially getting a 50 percent discount on any purchase of iTunes movies, TV shows, books, App Store and Mac App Store apps, In-App Purchases and subscriptions.
* Again, to purchase these digital vouchers from the PayPal Digital Gifts store, you must have a valid U.S. PayPal account.
