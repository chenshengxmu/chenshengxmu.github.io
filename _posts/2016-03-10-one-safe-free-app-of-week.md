* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app OneSafe. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pickup Lunabee’s popular password manager for free for both iPhone and iPad, a solid savings of $5.
* For those who aren’t familiar with it, oneSafe provides advanced security for your sensitive data with features like Touch ID, decoy safe, intrusion detection, and self-destruct mode. It stores logins, financial data, credit cards and more.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Protect private information your way in OneSafe’s versatile digital vault. Industrial-strength encryption lets you secure financial details, logins, documents, and more—even scanned credit cards—with a single PIN, password, or a drawn pattern. Accessing data is a snap thanks to easy organization and seamless syncing across devices. Complete with Safari integration and automatic strong password creation, OneSafe is the right kind of security tool—the kind you’ll want to use everyday.
