* If you’re running a Mac, you’ll need a virtual machine running Windows in order to jailbreak using OS X. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a Windows virtual machine and how to jailbreak iOS 9 on your Mac. It’s super easy, and takes less than 20 minutes to complete. Instead of waiting for a Mac tool, why not use a virtual machine and enjoy an iOS 9 jailbreak today?
* Note: I highly recommend watching the video to see how I pulled off this installation and jailbreak. There are a few settings I adjust during the virtual machine install that may help you out if you watch.
* Step 1: Download the Windows 10 ISO file. I recommend using the 64-bit ISO file.
* Step 2: Download VMware Fusion 8. Fusion comes with a free 30-day trial, which gives you plenty of time for jailbreaking your iOS 9 device. Once the download is complete, install VMware Fusion 8.
* Step 3: Install the Windows 10 ISO file using VMware Fusion 8. Customize the installation to lend it at least two processor cores and as much memory as you can spare. You do not need to use a product key, and you can choose easy install. Watch our video to see how I did it.
* Step 4: Download and install iTunes on your Windows 10 virtual machine.
* Step 5: Connect your iPhone to your Mac, and run iTunes in the Windows virtual machine. Ensure that iTunes recognizes the iPhone, and that you tap the Trust button on your iPhone and in iTunes.
* Step 5: Download Pangu for iOS 9 from our downloads page.
* Step 6: Follow our full iOS 9 jailbreak tutorial to complete the iOS 9 jailbreak on your Mac.
* The video that we’ve posted is a real time video that features no speed ups or shortcuts. I show you the entire step-by-step process, and it takes less than 20 minutes from start to finish. The time needed to download the Windows 10 ISO and VMware Fusion 8 is not included, since download times will vary among users.
* The bottom line is that just because Pangu is Windows-only, doesn’t mean Mac-only users should feel left out. Follow this tutorial, and you’ll have a jailbroken iOS 9 device in no time flat, even if you only have a Mac. There’s simply no reason to wait on Pangu or another team to release a Mac jailbreak tool for iOS 9, when this process takes less time than your favorite half-hour sitcom.
* Are you a Mac-only jailbreaker? What will you do?
