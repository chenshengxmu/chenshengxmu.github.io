* The Wall Street Journal is reporting on Monday that Apple is in talks to launch an online television service in September, with roughly 25 channels on board, including big names ABC, CBS, and FOX networks.
* The report notes Apple is targeting to announce the online TV service at WWDC in June, and the content will be available to view on the Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad, when it launches later in the year.
* It’s being reported by the publication that Comcast and Apple are currently in a fall out after years of talks, and thus, the content talks don’t involve Comcast-owned NBCUniversal.
* Other potential content could include channels from Disney (who owns ESPN), CBS, and 21st Century Fox, among other media companies as Apple continues negotiations.
* The Wall Street Journal says Apple’s service will provide customers a “skinny” bundle with well-known channels like CBS, ESPN and FX, while leaving out the many smaller networks in the standard cable TV package.
* Apple is said to charge roughly $30 to $40 a month. Dish’s Sling service has taken a similar approach, priced at $20.
* The rumor on Monday follows Apple dropping the price of the current Apple TV set-top box to $69 at its “Spring Forward” media event last week. Furthermore, previous rumors have indicated Apple plans to launch an App Store, along with a thinner version of its set-top box at some point this year.
* Former WSJ reporter Jessica Lessin calls Apple’s new initiative “Plan B”:
* Good @wsj story about Apple moving ahead with Plan B in TV. Plan A was working with cable cos. http://t.co/nDN4jzGO3F

* Recode’s Peter Kafka says “maybe”:
* Will it happen? Maybe. But here's a TV exec who's talking to Apple now: "Everyone's having hard time with pricing, costs."

* Some are already airing skepticism of the service:
* So $30 a month, I still have to pay my ISP $60, and I don't get NBC…but do get ESPN. Maybe. http://t.co/KugCb9Fnto
