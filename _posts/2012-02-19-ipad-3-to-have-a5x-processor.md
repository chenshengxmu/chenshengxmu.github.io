* The iPad 3’s processor is assumed to be called the ‘A6’, following Apple’s recent history. The iPhone 4 has the A4 processor and both the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S have the A5 processor. The iPad 3 featuring an A6 processor makes sense.
* However, according to a leaked image on Chinese forum WeiPhone, the iPad 3 will have an A5X processor, rather than A6…
* The upgraded processor has been rumored to be a quad-core processor, while some publications have said dual-core.
* As MacRumors points out, the code “1146” on the A5X processor indicates that the processor was manufactured November 14th-20th. Perhaps this could be just a prototype.
* The logic board looks close to the iPad 2’s, specifically around the power management chips. There’s also 16 GB flash memory chips from Hynix.
* It’s not clear if Apple will use an A5X processor rather than an A6, but this leak certainly looks to indicate it. Apple is rumored to announce the iPad 3 March 7th, with a launch a few days later. The tablet is also rumored to have a Retina display, LTE chip, and upgraded cameras.
* The lingering question is if the iPad 3’s processor will be dual-core or quad-core.
* Do you think Apple would use an A5X processor, rather than A6?
