* Just like that, in less than 24 hours, iOS 5 has already been jailbroken. Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd posted photos of an iPod Touch 4G sporting the Cydia and iSSH icons. So far this is only a tethered jailbreak, which requires to be plugged in the computer at every reboot.
* This jailbreak is not surprising in any ways because it is using the same bootrom exploit it’s been using since iOS 4.X. Apple can only patch this bootrom exploit with a hardware update…

* What does that mean? Simply put, it means that we’ll likely be able to jailbreak the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4G forever, however, new devices like the iPhone 5 and the iPod Touch 5G will most likely patch the bootrom exploit with hardware changes.
* Now someone needs to come up with an exploit that would allow you to run this iOS 5 jailbreak untethered. It’s probably only a matter of time.
* Excited?
