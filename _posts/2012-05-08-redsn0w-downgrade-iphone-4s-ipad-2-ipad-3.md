* Awesome news for those who accidentally updated the firmware for their A5 device (iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the new iPad aka iPad 3), possibly resulting in the loss of the precious untethered jailbreak. MuscleNerd has announced that an upcoming update to RedSn0w will allow users to downgrade their firmware.
* The only catch is that you have to have your SHSH blobs saved for the firmware that you wish to downgrade to. That means that if you purchased your iPhone 4S with iOS 5.1 pre-installed, there’s no way to downgrade to iOS 5.0.1 so that you can enjoy the benefits of pod2g’s untethered jailbreak…

* At first we were sure that this was a result of iH8Sn0w’s downgrade findings that he tweeted about a while back, but MuscleNerd confirms that the two methods are unrelated:
* @Oakland6980 @ih8sn0w no.He tweeted that his method has legal issues.This one does not (not could it ever).

* There’s still no ETA from MuscleNerd on when the new version of RedSn0w — presumably RedSn0w 0.9.11b1 — will be released, but considering he’s tweeting about it with an accompanying image, we can’t help but to think said release is pretty near.
* Stay tuned to iDB, as we’ll be sure to post a full guide on how to downgrade you A5 device once the new version of RedSn0w is released to the public. Also, be sure to check out our full RedSn0w guide for more information on how to use its varying features.
* Update: To eliminate any confusion, here are the downgrades possible:
* iPad 2/iPhone 4S: If you have iOS 5.0.1 SHSH blobs, you can downgrade to iOS 5.0.1 for an untethered jailbreak. The new iPad (iPad 3): You will be able to downgrade to 5.1 only. This is because there was no 5.0.1 for the new iPad to begin with, hence there are no SHSH blobs for 5.0.1 making a downgrade to this firmware version impossible.
* In other words, this will allow you to jailbreak your iPad 2 or iPhone 4S if you have SHSH blobs saved for 5.0.1. You will not be able to jailbreak the new iPad (iPad 3) even if you downgrade, because there is currently no jailbreak for iOS 5.1.
* Hope that clears things up.
