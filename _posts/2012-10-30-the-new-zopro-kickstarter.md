* We all know the scenario. You’re away from home, with no charger, and your iPhone just alerted you that its battery is now down to a measly 10%. What do you do?
* Well, if you had the new ZOpro case on your iPhone, you could use its integrated charger to breath life back into your handset. But wait, what’s a ZOpro case?
* The ZOpro is a new case for the iPhone 4, 4S and 5. It’s extremely thin — less than 3 millimeters, or about the size difference between the iPhone 4S and 5 — and has a number of unique features built in.
* The headlining feature is the integrated charging cable. If you ever find yourself in need of an iPhone charger, simply pull the case apart to reveal a dock connector (yes, even for the iPhone 5) and USB cable.
* But that’s not the only trick the ZOpro has up its sleeve. The case also supports a wide range of accessories including magnetic lenses (and Olloclip lenses), tripod and dash mounts, and countless other add-ons.
* The ZOpro team is currently trying to raise money via Kickstarter to start mass production. If you’re interested, a pledge of $20 or more is as good as a pre-order, and it will help them reach their funding goal.
* To be honest, the lens and tripod mounts don’t do much for me. But I’m not much for iPhoneography. I do like the idea of the integrated charging cable though, and think many people will find it to be useful.
* What do you think of the ZOpro?
