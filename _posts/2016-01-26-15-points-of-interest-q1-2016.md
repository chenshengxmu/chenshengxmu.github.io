* Apple announced the financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2016 this afternoon, and the numbers are pretty solid. The company broke its own records on handset sales, moving 74.8 million iPhones, and revenue, garnering nearly $76 billion during the three-month holiday period.
* We’ve just finished up the conference call, where Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri discussed Apple’s performance over the three-month period, and offered up some insights into its future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points from the call below.
* Additionally, in response to a veiled question regarding the possibility of a cheaper iPhone model, Cook explained that he does not see the company deviating from it’s current new-older-oldest strategy. I found this particularly interesting given the recent 4-inch iPhone rumors.
* If you want to listen to today’s earnings call, a replay will be available here for a limited time.
