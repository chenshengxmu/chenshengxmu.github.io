* When Apple teased its new Mac Pro at WWDC a few months ago, the company’s marketing honcho Phil Schiller put up a slide showing a guy in an editing room in front of three huge 4K monitors, all hooked up to the machine. “You could be that guy,” he quipped, provoking a laughter from the audience.
* Schiller also said Apple was working on a Final Cut Pro update optimized for the Mac Pro’s powerful dual AMD FirePro graphics and he wasn’t lying: just as the new Mac Pro launched on the online Apple Store this morning, Apple followed up by pushing updates to Final Cut Pro, Compressor, Motion and its other pro apps, all optimized for the Mac Pro’s hardware and with 4K content, 4K monitoring support via Thunderbolt 2 and HDMI on select Mac computers and a whole bunch of additions and performance enhancements…
