* iCloud Drive is a new integrated cloud storage solution for Apple devices. It’s available on both iOS devices running iOS 8, and Macs with OS X Yosemite installed.
* iCloud Drive taps into your existing iCloud Storage to act as a central hub for all of the files stored in iCloud. Watch our video walkthrough after the jump for additional insight…
* The big difference with iCloud Drive as compared to previous implementations of iCloud, is that a). It’s easily accessible from the Finder. b). You can upload any type of file to iCloud Drive just as you would with any other folder in Finder. c). iOS devices and Macs can both access and share stored files.
* Think of iCloud Drive as a natural evolution of iCloud, and as a potential Dropbox replacement. There’s even a Windows client for those of you who like to use Windows machines.
* Have you experience iCloud Drive yet? If so, what are your thoughts on it thus far?
