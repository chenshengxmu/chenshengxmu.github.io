* I’m sorry for polluting your reading list with more Google news, but this thing warrants a quick mention. So we already told you about impressive Android stats, Google’s own tablet called the Nexus 7, a new Android version (4.1, called Jelly Bean) that sports Siri-like features and a brand new native Google+ app for iPad and Android tablets. Google also surprised us with the coolest live tech demo ever: a parachute landing on the Moscone West building, seen through the eyes of the participants’ Google Glasses.
* By the way, Tweetbot developer has gotta win the coveted title of The Most Original Google I/O Review for his tweet. So, one thing that especially captured my imagination is this cool-looking accessory aimed at streaming media at your home. Classed as a yet another piece of hardware designed and engineered by Google, the Nexus Q sports unique industrial design calling for a round chassis which reminds me of a lot of a sci-fi-like alien probe. It’s also got some noteworthy features, as seen in a video demonstration…
* Yes, of course it’s driven by Android.
* It plugs into the speakers and your TV set and is being billed as “the first-ever social streaming device”. It plays nicely with Google’s Play Store to stream your music from the cloud, a kind of a cloud-connected jukebox.
* But what about the social aspect?
* According to the company, the Google Q lets everyone bring their own music to the party, here’s a video.
* And here’s how Nexus Q works.
* The Nexus Q is going to be available first in the United States beginning mid-July. You can pre-order it today from Google Play for $299, which seems a bit pricey considering that a $150 more buys you the entire Sonos system with bad-ass speakers.
* Wondering what this thing looks inside?
