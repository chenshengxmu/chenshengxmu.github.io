* The irresponsibly leaked iOS 11 Gold Master build is a gift that keeps on giving, but tvOS 11 has its own secrets as well, with latest discoveries pointing to a refreshed Siri Remote in tow for a fifth-generation Apple TV model to be called “Apple TV 4K”.
* As a bonus, the updated remote could feature haptic feedback (with 3D Touch support?).
* As per code leaks shared by 9to5Mac, there’s evidence in the tvOS 11 firmware that the Siri Remote model number has jumped from “B239” to “B429”, indicating an imminent refresh.
* Furthermore, Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo has found references to “actuator calibration” and “force calibration” in the firmware that could indicate haptic feedback coming to the next-generation Siri Remote, perhaps by way of a miniaturized Taptic Engine.

* The new remote hardware identifier was discovered in the Siri Remote firmware itself, which is separate from the current Siri Remote. 9to5Mac clarifies that a change in model number does not necessarily mean that new hardware is on its way.

* Nevertheless, conventional wisdom teaches us that an updated Siri Remote should be bundled with the new Apple TV 4K. As iDownloadBlog first reported last week, the existing Siri Remote is on a serious backorder, with 1-2 week shipping delay in most countries.
* And shipping in Europe and elsewhere on Sep 12. What a convenient date to pick! https://t.co/YD3fwVxndU

* I wasn’t a big fan of Apple TV until a fourth-generation model came along, which won me over with its hardware improvements and App Store. I couldn’t be more excited for Apple TV 4K although I’m not sure my wallet will withstand purchasing a 4K television set to go with it.
* Are you looking forward to Apple’s refreshed box?
