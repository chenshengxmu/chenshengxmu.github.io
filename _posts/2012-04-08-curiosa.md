* Wouldn’t it be nice to have notifications whenever new Cydia updates are released? It’s already been done once with Aptdate, but that’s now been one-upped courtesy of Ryan Petrich’s latest creation entitled Curiosa.
* Like Aptdate, Curiosa provides you with banner notifications for new Cydia updates, but this tweak includes quite a few additional options as you’ll notice from our video walkthrough…
* Curiosa can be picked up for free on Ryan’s beta repo: http://rpetri.ch/repo/. It includes options for refresh intervals, along with the ability to key on specific keywords if you want to check for an app or tweak that you don’t have installed on your device.
* I highly recommend that those who want to be on the bleeding edge of all things Cydia — check this tweak out. It works well for me, but remember it is still in beta.
* Have you tried out Curiosa? If so, what was your experience?
