* I’ve seen it, and no doubt you’ve seen it. A new iPhone is released and people get excited; people line up hours in advance just to get their hands on the latest goods from Apple.
* Then there are the folks that have never even owned an iPhone before; many of them are excited as well because this new release will be their first taste of the iPhone.
* My point is, if there’s one thing that the introduction of a new iPhone does, it’s bring excitement to the mobile phone landscape, and guarantee a heaping helping of first time adopters.
* Unfortunately, it looks as if the Verizon iPhone 4 didn’t quite accomplish that…
* Marco Arment — the founder of popular offline content reader Instapaper — suggest that the Verizon iPhone might not be doing so well when it comes to pulling in first time adopters.
* He noted that his app didn’t get the usual “huge spikes” in sales that most developers of popular apps receive when new iPhone hardware is released.
* That makes sense, seeing as the Verizon iPhone 4 is just that, an iPhone 4 — hardware that’s already a good 8-9 months old.
* It also suggests the possibility that Verizon sales just weren’t that astounding, or that most of those who did adopt the Verizon iPhone where refugees from camp AT&T.
* Whatever the scenario, we hate to say that we told ya so; but, well yeah, we told ya so.
* How many people do you know with a Verizon iPhone 4?
