* Twitter for iPhone and iPad, a free download from the App Store, now supports rich notifications on iOS 10 that come complete with embedded images and the usual options for interacting with tweets without having to open the app.
* Pressing a rich Twitter notification on the Lock screen or in the Notification Center with 3D Touch pulls up an expanded view of the tweet with an enlarged image thumbnail, along with the usual options such as Like and Retweet.
* With rich notifications on iOS 10, apps can deliver notifications to a user’s Notification Center and the Lock screen. In addition to text, rich notifications can include photos and other media, including streaming video.
* For instance, apps like Netatmo Security can embed live footage from your connected security camera or live streams of games via the MLB at Bat app, right within a rich notification.

* In addition to rich notification support on iOS 10 devices, Twitter 6.66.1 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch also fixed a bug to stop showing duplicate ”in-reply-to” in each tweet.
* Last but not least, they added a new “Turn off notifications for this conversation” button, allowing you to mute or completely turn off notifications for a specific conversation without alerting others in the conversation.
* Earlier this week, Twitter began rolling out an expanded Mute filter and a more direct way to report hateful conduct.
* Grab Twitter for iOS free from the App Store.
