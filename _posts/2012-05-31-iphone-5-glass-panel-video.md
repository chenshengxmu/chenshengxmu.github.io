* Japanese blog Macotakara just posted an interesting video which seems to compare an alleged next-generation iPhone glass panel against the current iPhone model. The clip depicts a taller but wider glass panel, supporting the mounting evidence that the iPhone 5 will introduce a new display size measuring slightly above four inches diagonally…
* Surprisingly, as seen in the above image, though the glass panel in question has the same width as the iPhone 4/4s, it measures 4.07 inches diagonally, or approximately 10.33cm, versus the 3.5-inch display on current iPhones.
* As a result, the next iPhone sporting this display would be a bit taller than the current iPhone 4/4S models that are 4.54 inches tall, or 115.2 mm.
* More precisely, the height difference between a 3.5-inch iPhone 4/4S and a 4.07-inch iPhone 5 would amount to approximately 10mm, or 0.39 inches.
* Not too much, but notable nonetheless.
* Macotakara explains (machine-translated):
* If you look at just how long or than the iPhone 4S, is the feeling you move up to the length of the sensor bar from Lacey. However, I think this length is shorter than the liquid crystal display area was expanded.
* Here’s the clip, courtesy of Macotakara.
* And this is that glass panel on top of the iPhone 4S.

* The glass panel Macotakara has gotten its hands on appears to be in line with the most recent leaks, specifically a metal backplate, a front panel and an alleged design schematic.

* The real thing or perhaps just someone who knows how to mold glass?
