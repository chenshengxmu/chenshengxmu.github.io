* Facebook yesterday announced that more than two billion people are now actively using the service every single month. This is a significant milestone that will further solidify Facebook’s position as the dominant social network and online identity system.
* “We’re making progress connecting the world, and now let’s bring the world closer together,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “It’s an honor to be on this journey with you.”
* According to Facebook, more than 175 million people share a Love reaction daily.
* On average, more than 800 million people like something on Facebook while over one billion people use Facebook Groups every month.
* To celebrate bringing the world closer together, they’ve created a new personalized video which will appear in your News Feed.
* You can also see it by visiting facebook.com/goodaddsup, where Facebook is featuring fun facts about how people are contributing to the community.
* I visited the link and was greeted with the following message: “Your video isn’t quite ready yet, but we’re working on it”. I guess I better check back later.
* Facebook added that its mobile app will now thank users for sending Love reactions, happy birthday wishes and creating groups as part of the milestone celebration.

* The automatically generated thank-you message will appear in your News Feed.
* Mark Zuckerberg recently communicated his company’s brand new mission statement.
* Speaking last week in Chicago at Facebook’s first Communities Summit, he said, “For the last decade we’ve been focusing on making the world more open and connected.”
* He then introduced the company’s new mission statement: Facebook, he said, is a place “to give people the power to build community to bring the world closer together.”
