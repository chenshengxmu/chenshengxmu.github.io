* Wouldn’t it be nice if you could compose a new mail or SMS message with the touch of a button? Well now you can.
* Introducing: Message Icons, a jailbreak tweak that recently graced Cydia. It allows you to bypass all of the fluff, and get right to writing an email or SMS message.
* It’s not the prettiest tweak in the world, but it’s most certainly functional. Take a gander inside for a visual rundown…
* Message Icons places two dedicated app icons on your iPhone’s SpringBoard, each one allocated to a singular purpose.
* The app icons themselves are quite ugly, but it’s nothing a quick UI refresh couldn’t fix in a future update.
* If you want to try out Message Icons, head over to the BigBoss repo on Cydia, where you can download it for free.
* What do you think?
