* A couple days ago, we were telling you the crazy story of Apple losing yet another iPhone prototype. Like me, you probably were very skeptical when you first read about an Apple employee losing an iPhone 5 prototype in a bar in San Francisco.
* The story took a more believable turn when we realized that the source was CNET, a respectable and trustworthy online publication that all of you have heard of before. It was still an incredible story, but because it came from CNET, we didn’t think twice about reporting it, just like every other blog out there.
* Things fell apart yesterday when The San Francisco Weekly revealed that the city Police had no record of any complaint from Apple or any investigation going on about that matter. In short, Apple never lost an iPhone 5 prototype…
* There’s just one problem: SFPD spokesman Officer Albie Esparza says no records exist of any such activity by SFPD inspectors.
* “I talked to CNET” reporter Declan McCullagh, Esparza tells SF Weekly. “I don’t know who his source is, but we don’t have any record of any such an investigation going on at this point.”
* So what happened? I see two possibilities.
* First, CNET could have made up this story just to get coverage. I can’t see this happening. A reputable website would not do that because they know they have more to lose than gain.
* Second, someone else probably made up this story. And who else but Cava22, the bar/restaurant where the iPhone 5 prototype was supposedly lost, would have anything to gain from making up such a scandal?
* We might never get to the bottom of this story. One thing is sure: Apple didn’t lose an iPhone 5 prototype.
