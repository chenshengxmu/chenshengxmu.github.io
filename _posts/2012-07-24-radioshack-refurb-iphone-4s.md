* RadioShack is no stranger to offering up iPhone deals. It’s previous deal, which ended in June, knocked $50 off of both the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 across all major carriers.
* Now it looks like the retail chain is back at it with a new sale on refurbished iPhone 4S models. Customers can pick up Apple’s latest handset for as low as $99.99…
* The sale comes in two flavors, “refreshed” and “remanufactured.” MacRumors has gotten the low-down on the promotion:
* “Refreshed phones are models that have been restored and repackaged internally (no full warranty), while remanufactured are used phones provided from a third party that have been remanufactured with a new warranty.
* Those looking for an iPhone 4S will be able to purchase a refreshed or remanufactured model on AT&T for $99.99 (iPhone 4S 16GB) and $149.99 (iPhone 4S 32 GB). Verizon models of the iPhone 4S are available for $99.99 (iPhone 4S 16 GB), $199.99 (iPhone 4S 32 GB) and $299.99 (iPhone 4S 64 GB).”
* Mix in the fact that Verizon buyers will also receive a $50 gift card to RadioShack in edition to the discount, and this actually makes for a pretty stellar deal.
* It’s worth noting, however, that these prices require a new two-year carrier contract. So that’s something to keep in mind with a new iPhone just a few months away.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
