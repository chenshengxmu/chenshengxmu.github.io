* Apple has apparently decided to postpone the announcement of a new Apple TV at WWDC next week, according to The New York Times. In a sweeping report on what to expect from the annual developer’s conference, the publication says the highly anticipated refresh of Apple’s set-top box is no longer in the cards for Monday’s keynote.
* In March, the well-connected John Paczowski of BuzzFeed reported that Apple would unveil a slimmer, more powerful Apple TV with a native App Store at this year’s WWDC. And since then, subsequent reports have reinforced the story, with the Times claiming that the new device would feature a redesigned remote with a built-in touchpad.
* Today’s report from the Times says that as recently as mid-May, Apple was still planning on unveiling the new TV hardware, along with an improved remote control and a tool kit for developers to make native big-screen apps. But the company has decided to postpone those plans partly because the product is not quite “ready for prime time.”
* Additionally, Apple has been struggling to reach deals with content providers for its subscription TV service, which it hoped would help differentiate its set-top box from other offerings. Echoing a recent Recode report, the Times says that major pain points in the negotiations have included disagreements on price, streaming rights and technology.
* It sounds like everything else we are expecting is still on track, though. The Times states that Apple is still planning to announce several refinements for iOS and OS X, a new tool kit that will allow developers to create native Watch apps, and a revamped streaming music service. Apple’s WWDC keynote starts at 10am PST on Monday, June 8.
