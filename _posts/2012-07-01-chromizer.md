* Chromizer is a free jailbreak tweak that will be available tomorrow on Cydia. Its purpose, as its name not-so-subtly alludes to, is to add additional functionality to the recently released Google Chrome browser for iOS.
* A tweak that’s compatibile with both the iPhone and iPad, Chromizer seeks to add a few missing features to the browser’s otherwise excellent stock feature set. For its initial release, Chromizer focuses on adding three new functions to the iPad: Pull to Refresh, full screen mode, and iPhone styled tab switching. For the iPhone, you’ll get the full screen mode and pull to refresh, since it already has the tab switching area covered.
* Is Chromizer a tweak that you should consider if you have a jailbroken iOS device, and Google Chrome is your browser of choice? Check inside for the answer…
* The full screen mode alone makes Chromizer worth installing, while the pull to refresh functionality and iPhone tab switching on the iPad are just icing on the cake. Simply put, Chromizer is a tweak that makes Google Chrome for iOS a more complete browser even in its 1.0 iteration. Surely, Google won’t rest on their laurels and will add most, if not all of these features to a future update of Chrome; in the meantime, though, this is the next best thing.

* Again, Chromizer will be a free jailbreak tweak available tomorrow on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. We’ll be sure to follow up with a post once it is available for download.
* What do you think? Do you use Google Chrome? If so, will you use Chromizer?
* Update: Chromizer is now available for public download.
