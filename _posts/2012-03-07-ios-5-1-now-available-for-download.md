* The most notable features for iOS 5.1 include Siri support for Japanese users, a new camera app for iPad, and a new camera shortcut.
* iOS 5.1 is available for the iPad 3, iPad 2, iPad, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch 4G, and iPod touch 3G. Additionally, Apple released iOS 5.0 for the Apple TV 3, and Apple TV 2.

* As expected, if you download Apple’s iOS 5.1 you will be losing your jailbreak.
* If you’re having trouble downloading OTA, you can download iOS 5.1 directly from our downloads page until it hits iTunes. iOS 5.1 should be available on iTunes soon, with iTunes 10.6 launching around the same time.
* We’ll be back in a few minutes with a hands-on of iOS 5.1’s new features. Stay tuned!
* Update: Apple has also just released iTunes 10.6. Get downloading!
