* Even though Apple’s iPad 3 event is just a few days away, we expect to continue to see a steady stream of tablet rumors. A lot of things are being put into motion in preparation for Wednesday, and there’s plenty of potential for new information.
* The latest report comes from the folks over at iLounge. The site is claiming that it has learned that Apple is working on a new “Smart Cover-influenced” case for its latest tablet, and we could see it unveiled at this week’s iPad event..
* Jeremy Horwitz of iLounge reports:
* “Said to be similar to Incase’s Magazine Jacket (and a host of subsequent alternatives that appeared for the iPad 2), this new case has a folding magnetized Smart Cover on the front, and a rear shell made from fiberglass covered with PU/bicast leather.”
* Honestly, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Apple unveil a new case this week. The company launched a case accessory alongside the original iPad (leather book case), and last year it showed off its magnetic Smart Covers.
* There’s also been talk of a “mystery accessory” that could turn up at Wednesday’s event. We’ve heard it could be anything from a new Apple TV remote to a keyboard dock, but a new iPad case sounds much more likely.
* What do you think? Will we see a new case at Wednesday’s iPad event?
