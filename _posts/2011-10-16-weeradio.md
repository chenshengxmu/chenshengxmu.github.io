* Steaming services like Pandora, Spotify, and Rdio are all the rage these days, but before those we had something called Internet radio.
* All you needed was one of the many streaming radio URLs, and you could stream music, talk shows, and virtually everything in-between.
* Believe it or not, Internet radio still has a huge following, as evident by WeeRadio — a Notification Center widget for iOS 5, which places your favorite Internet radio stations right at your fingertips…
* WeeRadio accepts both AAC and MP3 streams, and features options to add or remove stations directly from the widget.
* From my testing, it worked exceptionally well; I think any Internet radio fan will be supremely pleased with this jailbreak widget.
* If you’d like to test it out, head over to Cydia and search for it. WeeRadio can be purchased for $0.99 on the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think?
