* The Dev Team released an update to the beta version of its popular RedSn0w jailbreak tool this afternoon, with support for the latest iOS 6 firmware.
* Earlier today, Apple seeded iOS 6 beta 3 to developers. And for those of you that updated, you can now jailbreak with RedSn0w version 0.9.13dev3…
* For the Dev Team’s website:
* “The “dev3″ version covers today’s 6.0beta3 release (and also adds explicit support for 6.0beta2). Please point redsn0w at the 6.0b3 IPSW in order to jailbreak beta3 and boot tethered.”
* It’s worth noting that just as iOS 6 betas are meant for developers, so is jailbreaking them. This version of RedSn0w will not install Cydia, due to the fact that a number of packages have not been updated to support the new firmware.
* Nevertheless, for those that are doing it, you can find RedSn0w 0.9.13dev3 on our Downloads page. And if you need it, we have a full step-by-step guide on how to use it.
