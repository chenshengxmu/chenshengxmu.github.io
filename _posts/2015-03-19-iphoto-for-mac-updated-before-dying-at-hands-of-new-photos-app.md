* Apple has released an update for the iPhoto for Mac app on Thursday, updating the software that’s on its death bed before Apple transitions users to the new Photos app.
* The update, available through the Mac App Store’s software update tool, will help users transition their photo libraries to Apple’s new software when it’s eventually made available to the public. 
* The update adds the following:
* Apple hasn’t given a specific launch date for the new Photos app that’s currently in beta testing for public and private testers. However, the company has said it will be released at some point this spring.
* iPhoto for Mac has long been Apple’s go-to tool for managing photos on the desktop, however its new Photos app brings more powerful features.
* The Photos app also allows you to browse your photos by time and location in Moments, Collections, and Years views, navigate your library using convenient Photos, Shared, Albums, and Projects tabs, perfect your photos with powerful and easy-to-use editing tools that optimize with a single click or slider, and allow precise adjustments with detailed controls, and purchase prints in square and panoramic sizes.
* iPhoto was first released for the Mac in 2002.
