* MessageSwiper is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to quickly switch between ongoing conversations in the Messages app using swipe gestures. You can cycle through conversations via left and right swipes to instantly go forward or backwards through your various message threads.
* This is an extremely simple tweak that focuses on one particular area and does a commendable job of doing so. I do wish there was a swipe animation implemented when switching between message threads, but according to the developer, that’s due in an upcoming update.
* Currently, there are no options or settings to configure, but the developer says that support for biteSMS is coming soon as well. MessageSwiper can be downloaded for free via Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
