* Now that Christmas is just a tiny spec in our rear-view mirrors, it’s time to start looking ahead to the next gift-giving holiday: Valentine’s Day. And this morning, Apple started doing just that, highlighting the affair on its web store with a new “There’s more than one way to say I love you” iPad advertisement…
* The campaign, first spotted by MacRumors, features the iPad and iPad mini as the ultimate gifts for the February-holiday, along with the new iPod touch and iPod nano. And as usual, Apple is offering free engraving on these products, as well as free ‘Signature Gift Wrapping’ and free shipping on orders over $50.
* The company has also posted a new webpage with ordering deadlines, to ensure your iPad or iPod arrives at its destination by Valentine’s Day, February 14. Standard order deadlines range from January 30 to February 5, depending on the product and engraving options, and expedited goes all the way to February 11.
* Also, as a reminder for folks who live in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan or Thailand, Apple’s “Red Friday” Lunar New Year sale kicks off this Friday, January 25. The event is similar to November’s Black Friday, with Apple offering up deals on Macs, iPads, iPods and accessories.
