* Pokémon GO for both Android and iOS has been updated this week with a number of aesthetic changes and fixes that will make egg hatching and Pokémon type deciphering easier, among other things.
* The update brings the game up to version 1.13.3 for iOS.
* Starting with the most interesting feature of this update, Professor Willow has just figured out that eggs have different kinds of designs on them depending on the walking distance required to hatch them.
* 10 kilometer eggs, 5 kilometer eggs, and 2 kilometer eggs can now be discerned by the following new color designs:

* These designs will make it easier to tell which eggs are which at a glance without having to look at the numbers below them.
* Another change in this update will be noticed while looking at the list of Pokémon you’ve caught in the wild, the game will now display the Pokémon’s type in the information screen:

* In a previous update, Niantic brought type bonuses to Pokémon GO, which help boost your odds of catching Pokémon of certain types if you’ve caught a lot of them already, and now with this new feature you can more easily discern what type a Pokémon is after you’ve caught it for education purposes.
* The rest of the changes are minor for the most part, but they’re changes nevertheless.
* Anyone who’s using the Pokémon GO Plus wearable accessory can now see a low battery indicator when the battery level gets low and text fixes have been implemented throughout the game to improve legibility in certain interfaces.
* This update seems to be primarily aesthetics-based, as no groundbreaking new features have been added to the game this time around.
* We have yet to see Pokémon GO on the Apple Watch as shown at the keynote last month, however many players are hoping to see this feature soon as an alternative to buying the Pokémon GO Plus accessory.

* Don’t forget that from October 26th to November 1st, you can involve yourself in Niantic’s Halloween event, so enjoy your spooky Pokémon GOing!
* If you’re already playing Pokémon GO, you’ll find this update under the Updates tab in the App Store app on your iPhone or iPad. Alternatively, you can download the latest version of Pokémon GO for free from the App Store if you’re not already a player.
