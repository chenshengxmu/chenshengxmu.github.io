* It’s been quite the busy morning for the folks out in Cupertino. During its education event, Apple released a handful of new applications including iBooks 2, iBooks Author, and iTunes U. But it didn’t stop there.
* Apple has also released an update to its iTunes software today, bringing the music-syncing program to version 10.5.3…
* “iTunes 10.5.3 allows you to sync interactive iBooks textbooks to your iPad. These Multi-Touch textbooks are available for purchase from the iTunes Store on your Mac or from the iBookstore included with iBooks 2 on your iPad.”
* It doesn’t look like you need to update to 10.5.3 if you don’t plan on using iBooks — there doesn’t appear to be any new features in the software other than textbook syncing. Nevertheless, you can download the new iTunes from Apple’s website.
