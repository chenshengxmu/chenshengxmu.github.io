* Apple just announced its earnings for its September quarter, and despite all of the ‘doom’ talk and lowball analyst predictions, the numbers are actually pretty good. In fact, the company set records for iPhone and iPad sales, and revenue.
* We’re just finishing up the conference call, where Tim Cook and his CFO Peter Oppenheimer talked about Apple’s performance, and offered some insight into its future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points for you…
* Overall, Apple seems pretty happy with its record-breaking quarter, but Wall Street isn’t. APPL is down more than 8% in after hours at the time of this writing (-$44.17 per share) due to a huge miss on iPhone sales projection and low Q2 forecast.
