* Have you ever been in the middle of a great video, only to have the experience interrupted by an untimely banner notification? Not only is this visually disturbing, but incoming banners reduce the audio volume of a playing video as well.
* NoBanner is a new jailbreak tweak that puts an end to this issue. It suppresses banner notifications whenever playing video on your iPhone. Watch our video walkthrough for a demonstration of NoBanner in action.
* Once installed, you’ll find a preference panel for NoBanner in the Settings app. Go there, and you’ll notice a general kill-switch for the tweak, a section to exclude applications, and the ability to enable NoBanner for background music as well.
* All of the settings contained in NoBanner’s preferences work on the fly, so there’s no respringing involved when setting up an app filter, or disabling or enabling the tweak globally.

* After testing out NoBanner, it’s obvious that this tweak will be useful to many jailbreakers—especially those who consume lots of video on a regular basis. Your notifications still arrive on your iPhone, but the banner notifications are suppressed. If you open Notification Center, you will see the unread notification.
* You also have the ability to keep vibration enabled so that you’ll have some cue that a notification has been received. I didn’t test this feature since I have an iPod touch, which contains no vibration motor.
* NoBanner is available for $1 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and from my hands-on time with the tweak, I deem it to be worth its asking price. What do you think?
