* Apple’s smartphone lineup for this year spans what’s probably the widest iPhone price gamut ever, starting at just $449 for the entry-level 32GB iPhone 7 model from last year and going all the way up to the flagship $1,449 iPhone Xs Max with an insane half a terabyte storage.
* Deciding on one will be tougher than last year, when it came down to the choice between the notch or the chin. On the outside, all new iPhones look the same because they utilize the same fullscreen design with a TrueDepth camera system housed inside that chin.
* We’re eager to learn which new iPhone model you might want so do cast your vote right below, but don’t forget to share the specifics of your preferred configuration in the comments.
* Which 2018 iPhone model do you plan on buying?
* We couldn’t list all the SKUs to cover every possible color, size and storage combination, but don’t worry—we’ve made the poll short for the sake of clarity and brevity.
* To refresh your memory, iPhone Xr is available in these storage capacities:
* The Xr is going to take a little longer than the Xs family. Apple will begin accepting pre-orders for the new iPhone Xr models next month on Friday, October 19, before the handset starts shipping the following Friday on October 26.
* You can pre-order yours from Apple’s Buy iPhone Xr page.

* And here are the iPhone Xr colorways on offer:
* I wish these colors were available on the Xs line.
* Both iPhone Xs and its bigger sibling, iPhone Xs Max, offer these storage capacities:
* iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max will be available to pre-order from Friday, September 14, ahead of their scheduled shipping on the following Friday, September 21.
* You can choose your model and see pricing information on Apple’s Buy iPhone Xs page.

* The phones are available in three color finishes:
* Note that the new 512GB storage SKU is exclusive to the Xs family.
* On a positive side, you no longer have to skimp on major features if your budget doesn’t permit opting for the pricier Xs line because the Xr is basically an Xs with an aluminum rather than the stainless steel band, no 3D Touch, no OLED and a single-lens rear camera.

* I say “basically” because there are other differences between the Xr and Xs series, but something tells me this won’t matter much to average buyers who will base their purchasing decision on price, size and color now that all new iPhones look and behave the same.
* Again, if you’re going to cast a vote then please share your preferred colorway and storage capacity in comments and feel free to explain the reasoning behind your decision.
* We’re all friends here. If you dislike Apple or don’t prefer any of the new iPhones, the iDownloadBlog community would still like to hear from you in the comments down below.
