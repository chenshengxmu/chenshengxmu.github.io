* I’m totally stepping into Cody’s territory by telling you about these great deals, but I’m too excited to let him share them with you. iTunes is currently having a massive sale on music and movies with albums as low as $5.99 and movies selling below $5. There are just way too many to list them all here, so instead, I’ll share with you a link to each section as well as a few of my favorites.
* Which one of these movies and albums are you going to get? Share your favorites in the comments section.
