* Autoplay videos are everywhere these days and Facebook is no exception. I suppose an argument could be made that autoplay content provides a smoother user experience by removing the need to manually tap the play button.
* But having videos load automatically as you scroll through your News Feed on Facebook might incur mobile data overage charges that outweigh any benefits. That a lot of users deem autoplay videos a total nuisance and distraction, played silently or not, isn’t helping either.
* If you use Facebook’s mobile application, I’ve got some good news for you: autoplay videos in your News Feed can be easily turned off completely with just a few taps. Or, you could do as I do and set videos to autoplay on Wi-Fi only in order to avoid unwanted cellular charges.
* You can adjust the Facebook app’s autoplay settings to Wi-Fi and cellular connections, Wi-Fi only or off.
* Step 1: Launch the official Facebook app on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. The app is available at no charge in the App Store.
* Step 2: Tap the More icon in the lower right corner of the screen.

* Step 3: Scroll down and tap on Settings. Choose Account Settings in the pop-up menu.

* Step 5: Hit the Autoplay option in the Video Settings section.

* Step 6: Lastly, choose when videos will autoplay in your News Feed: On Mobile Data and Wi-Fi Connections, On Wi-Fi Connections Only or Never Autoplay Videos.

* “Autoplay videos begin automatically as you scroll,” reads the feature description. “Videos use more data than other stories on Facebook, so choose when your videos autoplay here”
* Facebook will turn off autoplay “if your battery is low“.
* If you set your autoplay settings to On Mobile Data and Wi-Fi Connections, your cellular data is enabled and Wi-Fi coverage spotty, Facebook will attempt to retrieve News Feed videos through your carrier’s mobile data connection.
* In this scenario, the app’s cellular data usage depends on the amount of time you spend watching a video. If you scroll past an autoplay video in News Feed, your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad will use less data than if you stop to watch it for a longer period of time.

* If you set autoplay to On Wi-Fi Connections Only, videos won’t autoplay on cellular. However, in this scenario you can still manually click on a video to play it, in which case Facebook will load content over your mobile data connection.
* Facebook may also prompt you to click a video in your News Feed to play it even though autoplay is enabled. This typically happens when either your mobile data connection is slow or you’ve used a large amount of mobile data recently.
* And as mentioned, the app automatically turns off autoplay if the battery is low.
* Folks who enable autoplay videos but are concerned about their mobile data consumption are advised to choose the On Wi-Fi Connections Only option. Which brings me to iOS 9 and its new feature called Wi-Fi Assist. Wi-Fi Assist automatically switches to your carrier’s data network whenever it detects a poor Wi-Fi connection.

* In fact, iOS 9 enables this feature by default.
* More worryingly, Wi-Fi Assist will switch to mobile data when Wi-Fi coverage is spotty even if cellular data is disabled in Setting.
* Therefore, you might want to consider turning Wi-Fi Assist off in order to prevent unwanted cellular data charges when Wi-Fi is acting up and Facebook’s autoplay setting is set to On Mobile Data and Wi-Fi Connections.
