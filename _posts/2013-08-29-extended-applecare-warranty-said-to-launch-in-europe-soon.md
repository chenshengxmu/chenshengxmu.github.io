* AppleCare+, Apple’s extended warranty coverage for iPhones and iPads, could soon launch across Europe, if there’s merit to a report published yesterday by the French blog iGen. AppleCare+ is currently available only to customers in the United States, Canada and Japan, and can be activated in-store or online within 30 days of a device purchase.
* The $99 extended coverage gives you a piece of mind by providing repair or replacement coverage, both parts and labor, from Apple-authorized technicians for AirPort wireless appliances as well as your iPhone and iPad, its battery and the included USB cable and power adapter…
* According to iGen, the AppleCare+ plans could be made available to customers in Europe real soon, costing an estimated €99. At the moment, European shoppers are treated to Apple’s standard AppleCare warranty for iPhones and iPads which does not not cover accidental damage.
* In the U.S., the AppleCare+ warranty basically covers up to two incidents of accidental damage from handling of your device, each subject to a $49 service fee plus applicable tax. Note that Apple started repairing faulty iOS devices back in June and as of recently offers in-store $149 replacement screens for the iPhone 5.
* The rumored launch in Europe could be part of Apple’s broader strides in terms of customer support. For example, earlier this week the Apple Support website was redesigned for easier navigation, 24/7 web chat and mobile-optimized browsing from iOS devices.
* The iPhone maker is thought to be making important changes to AppleCare policies this Fall. In a nutshell, the company could be switching from a one-time payment to a subscription-based model for warranties and may opt to attach the warranty to the customer rather than a particular device.
* There are also credible indications of the rumored iPhone trade-in program trial-launching at Apple’s U.S. retail stores as soon as August 30, with wider availability expected in September.
