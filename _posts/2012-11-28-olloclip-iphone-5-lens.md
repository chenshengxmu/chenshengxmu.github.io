* Good news iPhoneographers, the Kickstarter project-turned-Apple-Store-favorite olloclip has just released an updated version of its multipurpose lens for the iPhone 5. Just like its predecessor, the new 3-in-1 accessory features a fisheye lens, a wide-angle lens and a macro lens to enhance your handset’s picture-taking abilities…
* Also like its precursor, the new olloclip slides on easily over your iPhone 5’s iSight camera and allows users to quickly switch between three lenses. The fisheye lens captures photos with a 180 degree field of view, the wide-angle lens enhances the iPhone’s normal field of view by 2x and the macro lens magnifies images by 10x.
* The good news is that olloclip says that the new 3-in-1 lens system is compatible with iOS 6’s new Panorama feature. Imagine the kinds of pictures you could take when you combine it with the fisheye or wide-angle lens. It also works with all iOS camera applications, so you give your boring Instagram photos a much needed boost.
* The attacheable lens kit comes in three different colors: red, black and white, and can be purchased for $69.99 from olloclip’s website. That might sound kind of steep to the average user. But if you find yourself taking a lot of pictures with your iPhone, and it seems like a lot of people are these days, it might not be a bad investment.
