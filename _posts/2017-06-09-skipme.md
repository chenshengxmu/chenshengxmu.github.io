* Have you ever tried to play a music collection or playlist from your iPhone or iPad only to find that some of the music wouldn’t be appropriate for the current circumstances?
* A new free jailbreak tweak dubbed SkipME by iOS developer candoizo lets you filter certain music from your listening experience to tune your entertainment for certain moods or for sensitive audiences.
* The tweak adds a new block of options to the Settings app. Worthy of note, they’re not organized into a preferences pane, so you get this awkward set of options right in the middle of the main Settings app pane:

* Despite the odd placement, the options you have to work with are as follows:
* In the disabled state, you can listen to your music normally. It’s the mode you’ll most likely want to use when you’re utilizing headphones and want to listen to all your music in an unfiltered manner.
* The option to automatically skip explicit songs is useful for sharing your music with a group by playing it aloud in a car or in your home via a Bluetooth speaker. It lets you filter out any suggestive content or inappropriate words, which is perfect for listening to music in front of sensitive audiences like children and elderly family members.
* Lastly, the option to play only favorited tracks is perfect for when there’s a specific collection of songs you want to listen to when you’re in a good mood; it skips over all the songs you don’t want to hear in the moment.
* SkipME works in tandem with the stock Music app on your device, and is compatible with both music streamed via Apple Music and anything you’ve synced to your device locally via iTunes.
* If you’re interested in trying SkipME, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
