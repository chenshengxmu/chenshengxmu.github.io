* We are getting more hints at how Apple could create a cheaper iPhone, a device also dubbed by the press the iPhone mini and apparently meant to improve Apple’s standing in emerging markets such as India. In a new patent filing, the iPhone maker describes a production method similar to laminated fiberglass, but using ceramics. Zirconia and alumina could be combined to create a new kind of Unibody shell.
* The use of zirconia would mesh both with a report earlier this month that a low-cost iPhone could include a fiberglass housing, while also potentially drawing on a 2006 Apple patent regarding zirconia as being radio transparent…
* Apple’s patent filing describes ceramics as a “suitable material for an enclosure of an electronic device capable of wireless communications.”
* A laminated ceramic housing could feature structural walls formed from a multi-layered ceramic material that can be radio transparent, the company observes.
* The abstract reads:
* The multi-layered ceramic housing can be formed of a plurality of ceramic materials such as zirconia and alumina in any combination. The multi-layer ceramic substrate includes an inner layer and surface layers that sandwich the inner layer.
* The multi-layer ceramic substrate has an increased transverse strength due to the surface layers having a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is less than that of the inner layer.
* AppleInsider explains that by “sandwiching together layers of ceramic materials with varying properties, tensile stress and RF transparency being just two, a structurally rigid and useful housing can be fabricated.”

* Other reports have suggested Apple might use plastic to manufacture an iPhone that could compete with low-cost Android devices.
* Any mass production of a budget iPhone body with a ceramic body would entail developing brand new production methods first, which may take years. Such a wait may not benefit Apple, already seeking ways to get out of a revenue trough as quickly as possible.
