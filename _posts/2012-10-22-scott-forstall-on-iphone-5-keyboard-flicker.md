* If a growing thread on Apple’s discussion forum is anything to go by, a bunch of iPhone 5 owners continue to complain about an annoying flickering thing which apparently manifests itself when the software keyboard pops up on the App Store password entry dialog box.
* A report out this morning first suggested that an incremental iOS 6.0.1 update, said to have entered testing, will fix this and other issues plaguing the iOS 6 software. iDB has now received another confirmation that a fix is in the works, via an alleged email exchange between a reader and Apple’s SVP Scott Forstall who’s in charge of the iOS platform…
* Hat tip to our reader Aaron R. who gave us a heads-up on a response he received from Apple’s senior vice president of iOS software. Aaron wanted to touch the base with Forstall on the flickering thing and asked the executive to specify whether the hiccup was hardware or software-based:
* I am sure your guys know about this problem but I just wanted to ask one thing. On my iPhone 5 sometimes when I type my password into the App Store it has weird lines across the keyboard. Is this a hardware or software problem? If it is software will it be fixed in iOS 6.0.1?
* To this, Forstall allegedly responded:
* Thanks. Yes, we have a fix.
* We’ve verified the headers, but know these things are easily faked.

* Just as it famously did in the Jobs era, Apple’s PR team is going through ton of messages that hit executives’ public inboxes on an everyday basis, picking out every now and then a few messages that get replied to and published in the media.
* It’s just another rather informal venue of communication for the California-based gadget designer.
* For example, when Scuffgate threatened to snowball into a PR catastrophe, an email from Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller surfaced, arguing that scratches and nicks are the result of “normal” wear and tear.
* That communication was likely Apple’s way of dealing with a PR crisis on its hands. Foxconn later admitted to quality control issues, essentially refuting Schiller’s explanation. Furthermore, one analyst today wrote that Apple will partially absorb costs associated with stricter iPhone 5 manufacturing control, another proof that Apple was aware of manufacturing issues with the handset well in advance of the September 21 launch.
* In another email exchange, Schiller reportedly explained that the latest iPod touch doesn’t have an ambient light sensor due to space constraints.
* Are you buying into these email exchanges?
