* Yesterday, we reported that Samsung was the sole manufacturer of the Retina displays Apple is using in its new iPad. Although Sharp and LG were expected to be the main panel suppliers for the tablet, word is that they couldn’t meet Apple’s tough QC standards.
* But it appears that this may not be the case — at least for LG anyways. Reuters is reporting today that it has heard from an anonymous source that LG Display is also filling Retina display panel orders for the new iPad…
* “Flat screen make LG Display Co Ltd is supplying touch-screen panels for Apple Inc’s new iPad, a source close tot he matter said on Wednesday.
* Bloomberg reported earlier that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd was the sole supplier for the new iPad, launched last week, after LG and Japan’s Sharp Corp failed to meet the U.S company’s quality requirements
* “LG is also in a panel supply deal with Samsung for the new iPad,” the source said. The source was not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified.”
* The new iPads will become available to the public this Friday, and it shouldn’t be too long after that before we see the first tear-down. Perhaps that will reveal some more details regarding who is behind all of these Retina displays.
* Why is this important? Money. Samsung’s deal with Apple is rumored to be worth billions of dollars. A billion dollar order for display panels could certainly help out the stagnate LG, and could possibly save the floundering Sharp.
