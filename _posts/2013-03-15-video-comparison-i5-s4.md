* You saw this coming. Since the moment Samsung unveiled its new flagship Galaxy S4 handset yesterday, the iPhone 5 comparisons have been flying about nonstop. So a video comparison of the two devices was inevitable.
* This clip from the folks over at PhoneArena shows the i5 and S4 side by side, and their many differences, from display quality to build quality. It also showcases some of the the Galaxy S4’s unique new software features…
* Now, this isn’t exactly a fair fight, comparing Apple’s 6 month-old handset to Samsung’s yet-to-be released handset. But keep in mind that the two devices will sell head-to-head for at least a couple of months, so it is relevant.
* The first comparison made in the video has to do with build quality. And PhoneArena’s John V. agrees with the general consensus that the i5 wins this category. It’s made of metal, vs the S4’s plastic, so it looks and feels more solid.
* Next it shows the differences in the software offerings, and it’s no surprise that this one goes to the S4. Apple’s iOS hasn’t changed much over the years, while Samsung has added several new features to its TouchWiz Android shell.
* Finally, the displays. The iPhone 5 sports a 4-inch 326ppi (pixels per inch) Retina display, and the Galaxy S 4 has a 5-inch 441ppi super AMOLED display. From a distance, it’s hard to tell. But up close, the S4 has more detail.
* Of course, there’s no mention of performance here, or app quality/selection—two major factors in smartphone selection. But I think it’s pretty clear that the S4 is a formidable iPhone competitor, and Apple has their work cut out for them.
* The next-generation iPhone, rumored to be the iPhone 5S, is expected to launch sometime this summer.
* What do you think?
