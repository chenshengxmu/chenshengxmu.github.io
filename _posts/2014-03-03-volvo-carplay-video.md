* Hot on the heels of Apple’s CarPlay announcement earlier this morning at the Geneva Motor Show, car maker Volvo has posted a video showing off iOS integration in action.
* Unlike CarPlay implementations by other vendors such as Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz, Volvo took the feature to the next level.
* Specifically, Volvo’s system allows for both CarPlay and Volvo controls to be available to drivers simultaneously on the vehicle’s large touchscreen. I’ve included the video for your viewing pleasure right after the break…
* Check out below what happens when iOS meets Volvo’s new user interface.
* Volvo also issued a media release noting that its new XC90 SUV, which will be introduced later in 2014, is the first Volvo car to offer integration with Apple’s “widely-used and hugely admired” mobile operating system.
* Forthcoming Volvo models based on the new Scalable Product Architecture will get CarPlay later in 2014. The ability to connect an iPhone to the car’s dashboard system via Wi-Fi will be enabled “in the near future,” Volvo said. 
* Volvo links Apple’s CarPlay to a specially-developed interface that allows drivers to use voice and touch controls to access Apple features and services, as well as Volvo controls, simultaneously. The connection is based on a streaming H.264 video feed that returns user input from the touch screen.
* Volvo’s unique portrait screen gives users the benefit of having both Volvo and Apple content co-existing simultaneously, removing the need to switch between a dedicated car and iPhone screen.
* According to Apple, CarPlay launches with support for select third-party audio apps including Spotify, Beats Radio, Stitcher and iHeartRadio (sorry, Pandora/Rdio fans!).
* However, only Apple’s own mapping service is supported.
* Coupled together, Apple Maps and CarPlay work together to anticipate destinations based on recent trips via contacts, emails or texts and provide routing instructions, traffic conditions and ETA.
* This means CarPlay won’t integrate with third-party mapping applications such as Google Maps.
* “Users can easily control CarPlay from the car’s native interface or just push-and-hold the voice control button on the steering wheel to activate Siri without distraction,” explains Apple’s CarPlay preview page.
* Apple has led consumer technology integration in the car for more than a decade. CarPlay brings your car and iPhone together for a thoughtful experience that lets drivers focus on driving, while also tapping into everything they want to do with their iPhone.
* CarPlay launched with support in select vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo.

* Additional auto manufacturers will add the feature at a later stage.
* This includes such names as the BMW Group, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia Motors, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan Motor Company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp, who all confirmed plans to support CarPlay in their 2014 vehicles.
* CarPlay will be enabled via an upcoming iOS 7 software update on Lightning-enabled iPhones, including the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5.
* So, how do you like CarPlay so far?
