* Apple on Monday issued fourth betas of what would become maintenance and bug-fix updates to its four major software platforms: iOS, macOS Sierra, watchOS and tvOS. Members of the Apple Developer Program can now deploy iOS 10.3.2 beta 4 (build 14F5086a), macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta 4 (build 16F67a), watchOS 3.2.2 beta 4 (build 14V5485a) and tvOS 10.2.1 beta 4 (build 14W5583a) through the Software Update mechanism.
* The latest betas have arrived a week following third betas.
* First betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 and tvOS 10.2.1 originally released to registered Apple developers on March 28.
* iOS 10.3.2 beta 4 can be installed on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch in Settings → General → Software Update. On your Mac, macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta 4 can be deployed through Mac App Store’s Updates tab.

* On your fourth-generation Apple TV set-top box, tvOS 10.3.2 beta 4 can be installed in Settings → System → Software Updates → Update Software.
* On your Apple Watch, watchOS 3.2.2 beta 4 can be deployed in the Watch app on your iPhone by tapping My Watch → General → Software Update.
* Installing the betas over the air requires an appropriate configuration profile that can be downloaded and installed on your devices through Apple’s portal for developers.
* If you’ve enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, you can test-drive iOS and macOS betas on your own devices without being a registered Apple developer.
* We’ll update the post with any changes discovered in the latest betas.
