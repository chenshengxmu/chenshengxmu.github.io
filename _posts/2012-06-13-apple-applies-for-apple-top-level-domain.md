* The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today posted a list of nearly two thousand companies that applied for generic top-level domain names that will go into effect in 2013.
* These are basically Internet domain name extensions such as the familiar .com, .net or .org.
* Among the applicants is California-based Apple, which applied for the .apple top-level domain. Google, Amazon and other tech companies also sent their applications…
* Unlike second-level domains, top-level domains don’t exactly come cheap, fetching a cool $25,000 a year. More importantly, they are held to much higher security standards so their owners are expected to manage trademark take-downs if brands complain.
* Companies that cannot fulfill those requirements can expect ICANN to demand their top-level domain back.
* Rod Beckstrom, president and CEO of ICANN explains:
* This is a serious technical operation to run a top-level domain, completely different from a second-level domain. For the security of the internet, you have to do this right.
* Slashgear reports that Google has apparently applied for more than a hundred top-level domains, including of course .google and .android.
* Should ICANN approve Apple’s applications, .apple should go live some time during the second quarter of 2013.
* It’s just another way of strengthening Apple’s brand on the Internet.
* Like other big companies, Apple’s been relentlessly going after individuals who register domain names containing Apple brand names in the hope of pocketing a little profit from duping users into visiting ad-laden web pages.
* For example, having filed a dispute with WIPO, Apple has secured ownership of the iPhone5.com and recently forced a guy in Poland to relinquish ownership of aplestore.com and a bunch of other misspelled domain names.
* Just don’t expect the next iPhone to be called the iPhone 5 just because Apple owns the domain: it’ll likely just be forwarded to apple.com/iphone.
* Thoughts?
