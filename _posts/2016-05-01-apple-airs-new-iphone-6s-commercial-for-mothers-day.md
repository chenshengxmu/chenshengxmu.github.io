* Mother’s Day is one week from today. Apple has already sent an email blast to registered customers to remind them to pick up an Apple Watch as a Mother’s Day gift recommendation and now the company has started airing a brand new iPhone 6s television commercial, aptly titled “Mother’s Day”.
* The 30-second ad “celebrates motherhood through the lens of iPhone users around the world”.
* The video fits in Apple’s ongoing ”Shot on iPhone” campaign, which won one of the top prizes at the Cannes Grand Prix festival, by rotating a bunch of photos and videos that celebrate motherhood, taken by its own users.
* And here it is.
* The moving video is one of Apple’s better ads as of lately, wouldn’t your agree?
