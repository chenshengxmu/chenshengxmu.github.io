* Apple on Friday released macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 with support for external graphics processors and Business Chat in Messages as the two tentpole features.
* The update contains a number of additional features, as well as bug fixes and stability improvements, and is recommended to all users. You can deploy an over-the-air update through the Updates tab within the Mac App Store app on your system.
* Peruse the macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 release notes for detailed information on the feature improvements, as well as enterprise and security content in this software update.
* Not mentioned in the release notes, macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 also comes with a new wallpaper that was previously only available on iMac Pro.
* For those who can’t or don’t want to upgrade to this latest version of High Sierra, you can still enjoy this new wallpaper by downloading either the Mac version, or the one optimized for iPhone, both having been featured in our wallpaper selections before.
