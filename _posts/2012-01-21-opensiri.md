* Didn’t we tell you? The floodgates are opening for Siri tweaks now that the iPhone 4S jailbreak is available.
* OpenSiri is among the Siri tweak freshman class, and it allows you to launch stock Apple apps, plus Facebook and Twitter apps using nothing but your voice.
* Check out our hands-on video of OpenSiri in action…
* Right now the tweak is limited to the stock Apple Apps and the Facebook and Twitter apps, but the developer confirms that more features are on the way.
* Currently, you can launch apps using one of two voice commands: “launch” and “open”. There are no settings to adjust or anything, just install it and start using it.
* I’ve confirmed that it plays nice with Hands-Free Control as well, so this will allow you to launch specific apps without so much as laying a finger on your iPhone 4S.
* OpenSiri has already been submitted to BigBoss by the folks over at JailbreakNation, and should be available for free soon. When you get a chance to try it, let us know what you think.
