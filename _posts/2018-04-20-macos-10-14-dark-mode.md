* Apple may be working to expand its Dark Mode-like feature for macOS.
* Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo took a look at a WebKit nightly build posted back in March, discovering that Mac computers might get some sort of system-wide dark look on macOS 10.14. “The code in question is designed to adapt WebKit’s rendering of a website based on the effective appearance of the app,” he wrote.
* “Appearances” are how macOS changes the look of UI components like buttons and lists based on assets provided by the system. However, Irish developer Steve Troughton-Smith advised against conflating developer terms with user terms.

* “The appearance system has been around for a few years,” he said. ”This suggests merely that (some? internal?) WebKit apps may want to know about the dark menu bar and dock, not necessarily that all apps do.”
* Apple introduced limited Dark Mode-like appearance with OS X Yosemite.

* Activated by venturing to System Preferences → General, and checking the option Use Dark Menu Bar and Dock, it simply makes your Mac’s Dock, menus, the menu bar and the Spotlight Search overlay darker in appearance.
* What this is not is a true dark mode.
* Troughton-Smith argues that exposing the dark menu bar and dock appearance setting to macOS apps would make a lot of sense. “No idea why it wasn’t a public API before,” he added.

* Interestingly enough, back in July 2016 Guilherme had managed to find a way to enable a more comprehensive dark appearance for Apple’s stock Mac apps such as Safari and System Preferences. You can see those screenshots included in this article.
* This might mean Apple’s has been building support for a full-on Dark Mode feature for a future macOS update. At least we now know that the company is testing this feature internally.

* WebKit’s code also suggests that iOS 12 will support iPhone 5s, like iOS 11 and older versions. If true, that would make iPhone 5s, Apple’s first 64-bit smartphone, the oldest iPhone model supported by the mobile operating system.
* Despite the rumors about a true Dark Mode for iPhone, iPad and Mac, Apple has yet to announce anything for iOS or macOS with regard to this sought-after feature.
* But we should know more soon in terms of Apple’s plans, if any, for a system-wide Dark Mode in iOS and macOS—in about a month and half, the Cupertino tech giant will preview iOS 12, macOS 10.14 and other OS updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference.
* How badly do you want to see a true Dark Mode in macOS?
