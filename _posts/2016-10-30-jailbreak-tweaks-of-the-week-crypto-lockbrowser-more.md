* Drowned out by the excitement behind the release of iOS 10.1 to the public and Apple’s ‘Hello Again’ special event this week, the jailbreak community has been pretty quiet this week.
* Nevertheless, we’ve still seen a number of new jailbreak tweak releases in Cydia and we’ll go over all of them in this roundup.
* LockBrowser – $0.99

* LockBrowser is a great new jailbreak tweak that puts a full web browser right on your Lock screen.
* With it, you can set any home page you want that will load any time you bring up the web browser. Google is set as the default so you can perform quick searches to get to any website.
* You can then use any of the navigational buttons at the bottom of the browser to control your web browsing experience.
* You can learn more about the tweak and how it works in our full review.
* Crypto – $1.49

* Crypto is a pretty brilliant little tweak that lets you encrypt any string of text on the fly with Action Menu.
* You can encrypt notes, URLs, messages, and more. You will then have to enter your password to decrypt whatever you’ve encrypted. What’s more is you can share your encrypted text with other Crypto users, and they can decrypt your messages with their password.
* Crypto relies on an internal 256-bit encryption method to make this possible, making it a great way for two people to communicate back and forth in a fully-encrypted way.
* You can read our full review of Crypto to learn more about how it works.
* ArtworkUpNext: Queues songs in the Up Next menu when you tap on their album artwork (free – review)
* DimLockView: Dims the passcode page on the Lock screen when unlocking (free)
* PlayDismiss: Dismisses the video controls in the iOS video player as soon as you tap play (free – review)
* Although that rounds everything up for this week, we’re sure we’re going to see more in the coming week.
* If you’re looking for more jailbreak tweaks to trick out your jailbroken iPhone or iPad, you can also read last week’s roundup to see if you’ve missed anything special.
