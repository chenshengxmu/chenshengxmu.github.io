* Just two days after releasing iOS 10.2 beta 6 to members of the Apple Developer Program and Apple Beta Software Program and five days since iOS 10.2 beta 5 dropped, the Cupertino firm on Wednesday morning seeded a seventh beta of what would become the second major software update to iOS 10 since its September 2016 launch.
* iOS 10.2 beta 7 (build number 14C92) is available as an-over-the-air download via the Software Update mechanism on devices with a prior beta and an appropriate configuration profile installed. A standalone installer is available via Apple’s dedicated portal for developers.
* Aside from bug and security fixes, iOS 10.2 packs in new features like Apple’s new channel guide app, simply called “TV”, and the Emergency SOS feature which debuted on the Apple Watch last year.
* You’ll enjoy three new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus-exclusive wallpapers in iOS 10.2, an option to preserve camera settings, all-new “Love” and “Celebration” screen effects in Messages, additional music sorting options, dedicated buttons for Repeat and Shuffle in the Music app and more.
* Many of the existing emoji characters have been redrawn in iOS 10.2 while a bunch of new ones were added, including clown face, drooling face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant and more.
* As a bonus, there are some new profession emoji available in iOS 10.2 in both male and female genders, such as firefighter, mechanic, lawyer, doctor, scientist and more.
* iOS 10.2 should release for public consumption some time next week.
* We’ll update the post with new changes in iOS 10.2 beta 7 if we encounter them.
