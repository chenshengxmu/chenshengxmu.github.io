* The AppleCare support staff has begun official OS X Mavericks training in anticipation of the looming OS X Mavericks release, a reliable blog has learned. The upcoming Mac desktop operating system release should hit the Mac App Store before November and will bring a host of improvements and new features, including Maps integration across desktop and mobile, better handling of notifications, and several new features for power users. Apple first demoed OS X Mavericks at its summer developer conference in June 2013…
* Mark Gurman, writing for 9to5Mac, learned from “several sources” that training has begun today.
* Support staff will be required to learn about the operating system’s new features, installation process, and troubleshooting options for at least six hours over the course of the next few weeks.
* This is Apple’s usual modus operandi.
* For instance, the company had begun iOS 7 training about three weeks ahead of the official October 18 mobile operating system release. If that pattern repeats itself, OS X Mavericks should be out before October wraps up.
* There have been eight developer previews of OS X Mavericks so far, the last one arriving a little over two weeks ago. Mavericks is a tenth major release of the desktop operating system powering Macs.
* The software focuses on performance improvements and power efficiency, especially on MacBooks, while bringing out such noteworthy end-user features as a standalone Maps and iBooks (see below) app and improved Notification Center where reading a notification on an iOS device removes it on the Mac, and vice versa.

* Other features include Finder Tabs and Tags, improved support for multi-display setups, Safari enhancements and lots more.
* Mavericks should be distributed through the Mac App Store exclusively and I heard from several credible sources that Apple will price it under twenty bucks.
