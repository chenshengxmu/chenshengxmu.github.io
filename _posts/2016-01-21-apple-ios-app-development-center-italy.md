* Apple on Thursday announced it is opening Europe’s first iOS App Development Center in Italy. Located at a partner institution in Naples, it will support teachers and provide a specialized curriculum to give students practical skills and training on developing iPhone, iPod touch and iPad apps. This new program should expand to other countries around the world.
* Across Europe, iOS developers have earned over €10.2 billion thus far, or about $11.11 billion, with the App Store having helped create more than 75,000 new jobs in Italy alone.
* “Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success,” said Apple’s boss Tim Cook.
* Based on latest research by Dr. Michael Mandel of Progressive Policy Institute, Apple’s ecosystem has created more than 1.4 million jobs in Europe, 1.2 million of which are directly attributable to iOS app makers, software engineers and entrepreneurs.
* Apple also partners with European manufacturing companies. For example, the sophisticated glass panes for the upcoming Campus 2 building are being curved on-site in a factory in Germany, and shipped in.
* Milan, Italy-based magnetization equipment maker Laboratory Elettrofisico provides magnetic features found in Apple’s gadgets and Europe’s Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems supplies Apple with sensors and audio technologies found in iOS devices.
