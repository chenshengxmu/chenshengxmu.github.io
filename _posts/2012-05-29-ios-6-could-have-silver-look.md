* Today’s a leaks day, folks. First we learned that Apple will be kicking off the upcoming WWDC with a 10am PT keynote come June 11, then a cool-looking aluminum backplate surfaced to reveal a couple nuggets concerning a sixth-generation iPhone and now a set of photos from “a trusted source” (aren’t they always?) show off the exciting new 3D mapping functionality of the re-worked Maps app in iOS 6.
* Oh, and Apple also launched the official WWDC 2012 app. Taking it all in, we can now conclude with a reasonably high degree of probability that folks in Cupertino are ready to ditch the familiar blue theme in iOS and supplant it with a fresh new sexy silver look.
* How’s that? Read on…
* The first hint came via Boy Genius Report which published leaked photos of the enhanced Maps app in iOS 6.
* The program reportedly rocks a brand new three-dimensional view, with editor Jonathan Geller observing in his article (emphasis mine):
* BGR has obtained exclusive information and photos of parts of Apple’s new Maps app from a trusted source, and the app features a refreshed user interface including a brand new navigation bar.
* This bar, we’re told, is silver instead of blue.
* And if that wasn’t enough, Geller speculated that “since the current Maps app follows the standard blue iOS color scheme, we think it’s possible Apple might shift toward a silver color theme in iOS 6 like on the iPad”.
* We originally dismissed Geller’s thinking as convenient speculation until Killian Bell, writing for Cult of Mac, pointed out a similar change in Apple’s official WWDC 2012 app.
* If a picture speaks more than a thousand words, this one speaks for itself.

* Killian noted:
* Unlike last year’s app — which featured a black bar along the bottom and a blue bar along the top, like traditional iPhone apps — this one sports silver bars and buttons both top and bottom.
* It’s also worth pointing out that Apple’s been transitioning its iLife suite on the Mac toward the silver appearance, iPhoto being the perfect example.
* Plus, a number of stock iPad apps sported silver appearance from day one, including Maps and YouTube, for example.
* If you ask me, the new look – apart from being fresh and novel – is a lot easier on the eyes and more elegant.
* It just looks right.
* Proof #3.

* That is a supposed backplate of a sixth-generation iPhone in both black and white, apparently an early production component. As you can see, it’s aluminum-clad back tells us the next iPhone could revert to a tad industrial look akin to the original model.
* This just makes a whole lot of sense to me.
* When you take a look at your iMac and examine both its exterior and what’s on the screen, it just all falls into place appearance-wise.
* The shiny, stunning look and feel of its aluminum chassis is seamlessly reinforced with a grayish theme of OS X Lion.
* Everything’s kinda fusing smoothly into this aesthetically uniform and pleasing experience: the hardware, the software and the industrial design.
* Who’s to say Apple isn’t about to re-imagine the iOS software and mobile devices along the same lines?
* If this silver user interface appearance is really in the cards, here’s to hoping they will consistently apply it system-wide because Apple’s not terribly known for consistency with these things.
* So, would you prefer your next iPhone to have an all-metal backplate augmented with brand new silver theme in iOS 6?
