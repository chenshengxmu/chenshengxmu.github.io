* With Apple expected to hold its next iPhone announcement on October 4th, we’re all wondering when we’ll be able to get our hands on the iPhone 5/iPhone 4S. We can look back at history and guess, but 2011 has proved to be an entirely different roadmap for Apple. Anything could happen.
* The first real hint at the next generation iPhone release date may have just been dropped, thanks to AT&T’s early upgrade policy…
* GottaBeMobile reader Mat sent the site a tip about AT&T’s early upgrade date for the iPhone. When Mat logged into his AT&T account, he saw that he could get a “reduced discount on an iPhone on 10/13/2011.” His standard upgrade date is scheduled for November 17th.

* Early upgrades for the iPhone are typically given by carriers to qualifying customers when a new iPhone is announced.
* There were 17 days between the iPhone 4 announcement and launch, and only 11 days between the iPhone 3GS announcement and launch. A 9-day gap for the iPhone 5 is believable.
* October 13th is a Thursday, and that date lines up with previous Apple launches. The iPhone 4 was launched on a Thursday.
* Two dates to mark for the calendar: October 4th for Apple’s keynote, and October 13th for the next gen iPhone(s) launch. We’re calling it now.
* Login to your AT&T account and let us know if you get a similar message about an early upgrade. We haven’t been able to independently confirm GottaBeMobile’s discovery, so we’re operating on guesswork.
