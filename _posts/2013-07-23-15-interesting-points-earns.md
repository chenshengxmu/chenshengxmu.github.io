* Apple just announced its earnings for its June quarter, and despite all of the ‘doom’ talk and lowball analyst predictions, the numbers are actually pretty good. In fact, the company set a record for iPhone sales during the 3-month period.
* We’re just finishing up the conference call, where Tim Cook and his CFO Peter Oppenheimer talked about the quarter, offered some insight and fielded several questions. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points for you…
* Overall, it seems like Apple had a solid Q3 thanks to huge growth in iPhone sales—which makes up over half its business. Admittedly, iPad and Mac sales are down, and margins aren’t where you want them, but APPL is up 4% in after hours.
* And the big takeaway here, for me at least, is that this was an extremely quiet quarter for Apple, product-wise. Sure, it released that 16GB iPod touch. But there was no new iPad or iPhone, which it sounds like Apple is saving for the fall.
* The next few months should be very exciting.
