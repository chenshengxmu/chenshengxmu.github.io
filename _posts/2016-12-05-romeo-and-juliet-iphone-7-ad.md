* Apple on Monday night posted a new iPhone 7 commercial it’s calling ‘Romeo and Juliet.’ The ad, which aired during Monday Night Football, highlights the video recording capabilities of the company’s latest handset.
* The spot opens with two children acting out a scene from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. It looks very movie-esque, until the camera zooms out and you see a father sitting in the audience, recording the play on his iPhone.
* The tagline reads: your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.
* What do you think of Apple’s latest ad?
