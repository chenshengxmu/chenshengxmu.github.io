* If you purchased Delete Mail or Mark Read for your iDevice, you may have noticed that neither extension is compatible yet with the new Mail app in iOS 5. The iOS 5 update brings new mail management features to your device, but “Select All” is nowhere to be found.
* Many of us with large email inboxes are very wary of manually selection multiple emails to apply Mail actions. Simply put, it is very disappointing that neither Mark Read or DeleteMail have received iOS 5 updates yet.
* Thankfully, a new jailbreak tweak has been released to solve your massive message management woes. Most of Cydia’s recent activity has been centered on compatibility updates, but some game-changing newcomers have been appearing in the updates. Enter AllMail…
* AllMail is a simple tweak available in Cydia that appears in the upper-right corner of the Mail app when you tap the Edit button. You will be presented with Select All, Delete All, Move All, Mark All, and Hide All. Undoubtedly, this one trick pony aims to completely replace both Mark Read and Delete Mail.
* The best thing about this tweak is that it works hand-in-hand with Mail’s new management buttons at the bottom of the app. For example, if you don’t trust the functionality of Delete All to archive your IMAP-configured Gmail messages, then simply tapping Select All will select every message. From there, you can just tap the Archive button in the native app interface, and all of your messages will be archived. This works with the native Move and Mark buttons as well.
* The initial release does contain a few bugs, and you may experience MobileMail crashes while performing certain actions on inboxes with a high quantity of messages. Also, if you used Select All in conjunction with the native Archive button, you will have to tap Deselect All before you can use Select All again.
* An update has been released to address the issues, but due to connection issues to Cydia’s authorization servers at the time that this article was written, I was not able to test it out.
* You can grab AllMail from the Cydia store for $1.50. How do you think it stacks up against Delete Mail and Mark Read?
