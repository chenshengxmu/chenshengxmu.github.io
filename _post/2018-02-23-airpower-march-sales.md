* Fairly reliable Japanese outlet Mac Otakara has spoken (Google Translate) to reliable sources who have reportedly confirmed Friday that Apple would be kicking off sales of its AirPower wireless charging accessory next month.
* This corroborates a sketchy rumor by The Apple Post saying the wireless charging mat would go on sale via Apple retail stores and authorized resellers like Best Buy in March.
* Compatible with the ubiquitous Qi wireless charging standard, AirPower is capable of inductive charging of multiple Qi-compliant devices at once, including iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3. Apple will also release a Qi-compatible wireless charging case for AirPods that will work with the upcoming charging mat and other Qi chargers.
