title: New iPhone 6 renderings based on alleged leaked schematics

* A little over a week ago, Japanese magazine MacFan published alleged schematics for a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6. We called the drawings ‘sketchy,’ as they depicted a round iSight flash (instead of pill-shaped) and other oddities, but many of the details matched up with previous information.
* With that in mind, MacRumors commissioned designer Ferry Passchier to create some full product renderings of the two iPhone 6 models, based on the schematics, in an effort to bring the black and white sketches to life. And we must say, the outcome is one (or two) good-looking smartphone…
* MacRumors’ Arnold Kim breaks down the design:
* The iPhone designs in the drawings include several differences compared to the iPhone 5s. The top power button has been moved from the right side to the left side of the device. The rear camera on the larger model is also shown as protruding slightly from the rear shell, as is the case with the current iPod touch. The camera flash has also reverted back to a round-design unlike the one found on the iPhone 5s. 
* The consensus thus far is that Apple is working on two different iPhone 6 models: one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch display. It’s been suggested that the latter will be released several months after the former, or not at all, but a majority of the evidence we’ve seen points to two versions.
* Here are the two models in between an iPad mini and iPhone 5s:

* Outside of display rumors, though, iPhone 6 intel has been scarce and inconsistent. For example, we’ve heard conflicting info that Apple is both sticking with an 8MP camera for the handset, and upgrading to a 10MP. And we’ve seen multiple one-off reports calling for various new features.
* Still, we’re expecting this year’s iPhone to be a significant update from its predecessor and the above renderings line-up with those expectations. Not only do they echo previous renderings from Martin Hajek, but they also match up with this iPhone 6 dummy unit and other pre-production images.
* Last week, Reuters reported that iPhone 6 could go into production as early as May.
