* Last month, T-Mobile’s John Legere hinted that his company was planning another ‘uncarrier’ event. The outspoken CEO sent out a tweet saying something like “time to eliminate another customer pain point? Time for Uncarrier 4?”
* Well three weeks have gone by and we haven’t really heard anything else from Legere on the matter, until just a few minutes ago when he took the stage at T-Mobile’s CES event. As promised, he dropped another ‘uncarrier’ bombshell…
* From the company’s press release:
* “In its latest move, T-Mobile is eliminating one of the last remaining obstacles for individuals and families wanting to switch from AT&T, Sprint or Verizon to the Un-carrier by offering to pay off their early termination fees. With an eligible phone trade-in, the total value of the offer to switch to T-Mobile could be as high as $650 per line.
* “We’re giving families a ‘Get Out of Jail Free Card,’ said John Legere, president and chief executive officer of T-Mobile. “Carriers have counted on staggered contract end dates and hefty early termination fees to keep people bound to them forever. But now families can switch to T-Mobile without paying a single red cent to leave them behind.”
* The promotion starts tomorrow and it works like this: customers from the three major US carriers who hand in their eligible devices at any participating T-Mobile location and switch to a postpaid Simple Choice Plan can receive up to $300.

* That’s just for the device trade-in. After you purchase your ‘eligible’ phone from T-Mobile, you can send in their final bill from your previous carrier, and they’ll send you an additional payment equal to your termination fees, up to $350 per line.
* So while there are definitely some stipulations here, customers switching from Verizon, Sprint or AT&T to T-Mobile could wind up with as much as $650 in credits. That’s quite a bit more than AT&T is offering under its very-similar promotion.
* This counts as T-Mobile’s fourth phase in its ongoing uncarrier campaign. Last year it introduced new subsidy-free service plans, its new Jump upgrade plan, and announced that it would provide unlimited texting and 2G data in over 100 countries.

* In addition to paying ETFs, T-Mobile also announced today that it has the fastest 4G LTE network in the US. Legere said that T-Mobile doesn’t need to pay millions of dollars to a consulting firm to prove this to anyone, quipping “no claims, just data.”
* The CEO also offered up some preliminary Q4 numbers for the carrier, and they are impressive. In its Q4 2012, T-Mobile lost 500k subscribers, in Q4 2013 it added 1.64 million subscribers—the company’s best performing quarter in the last 8 years.
* So while John Legere may be an unconventional CEO, whatever he’s doing is clearly working. Not only is T-Mobile disrupting the wireless industry, but it’s making some money in the process.
* Thoughts?
