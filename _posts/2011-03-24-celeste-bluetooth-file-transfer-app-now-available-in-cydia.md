* It’s finally here! The team behind Celeste, CocoaNuts, has officially released Celeste, the long awaited Bluetooth file transfer app for iOS4.
* As a refresher, Celeste is a jailbreak app that allows your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch running iOS 4.2 or later to receive files from any mobile phone and any computer (Mac or PC) that supports OBEX Bluetooth file transfers.
* I noticed from our last article on Celeste that Bluetooth file transfer is a feature many of you were excited about, and I would hope Apple includes this feature in a future iOS update.
* Until then, the jailbreak community has got you covered!
* Additionally, every purchase of Celeste gets you a free copy of Gremlin ($1.99). Gremlin allows you to import received songs and videos into your iPod library, with full iTunes-sync capability.
* Celeste is available now for $9.99 in the Cydia Store from the ModMyi repo. As a special 3 day launch sale, Cocoanuts is offering the app for a $7.99 introductory price.
* Watch the video demonstration of Celeste below:
* Have you downloaded Celeste yet?
* We’ll have a full iDB review for you soon. Celeste looks promising!
