* Not five minutes after we posted the plist hack method for enabling panorama mode in iOS 5, the promised jailbreak tweak that does the same thing hit Cydia.
* The tweak is titled ‘Firebreak’ in reference to the plist value, and it’s much simpler to use than editing a plist value via iFile.
* If you want to use iOS 5’s hidden panoramic camera, then this is the definitive way to enable it…
* Firebreak is a free jailbreak tweak available in Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It does require a jailbroken iOS 5 device with a built in gyroscope (iPhone 4, iPad 2, etc.).
* Have  you tried panorama mode yet? Let us know what you think about it.
