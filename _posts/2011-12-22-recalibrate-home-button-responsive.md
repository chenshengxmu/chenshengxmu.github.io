* Sometimes the Home button on the iPhone just starts getting a little funky, a little laggy, a bit unresponsive.
* Most of the time, those issues are software based, unless of course you’ve dropped your iPhone in water while feeding your pet fish.
* For us non-fish owners, we’ve confirmed that a simple recalibration is usually all that’s needed to fix most issues with the iPhone’s Home button. Take a look at our video tutorial inside…
* Step 1: Open a stock app, like Weather or Stocks.
* Step 2: Press and hold your power button until “slide to power off” appears and release.
* Step 3: Press and hold your Home button until the “slide to power off” goes away, and the app force quits. Your iPhone’s Home button should now be more responsive, because it has been recalibrated.
* I realize this is a known trick that’s been floating around for some time, but I just used it myself personally for the first time and I got good results. What about you?
