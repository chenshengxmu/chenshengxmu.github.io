* Internet radio services like Pandora, Rdio, iHeartRadio, Deezer and many others have been feeling the heat following the launch of Apple Music with free 24/7 Internet radio, called Beats 1. Responding to competitive pressure, Rdio announced Wednesday that it is bringing live-broadcast radio stations to its iOS app, beginning with 500 stations owned and operated by its partner, Cumulus Media.
* The new stations are available through Rdio’s mobile app starting today and include many traditional AM/FM radio stations. Talk radio stations and sports ones are part of the deal as Rdio looks to counter Beats 1, which is anchored by human DJs in Los Angeles, New York and London.
* Users can search for live radio stations by name, call letters, or frequency. In the Stations section you can browse popular radio broadcasts nearby and around the country, such as Nash FM in Nashville.
* “Rdio is proud to also feature national programming such as NASH Next, spotlighting the best from emerging country music artists,” said the company.
* The app recommends similar stations and even lets you not only favorite any song playing on a live radio station, but add it to a playlist or download the song for offline listening (requires a paid membership).
* The Los Angeles Times reports that KLOS-FM (95.5) in Los Angeles and KFOG-FM (104.5) in San Francisco are among the new stations offered through the Rdio app.
* Here’s the full list of all stations live on Rdio as of today, sorted alphabetically by city.
* Their website offers a list of some of top live radio stations nationwide.
* Apple’s contracts with major music labels reportedly include rights to launch up to five additional Beats stations. The Verge said last week that Apple could choose to debut “a Beats 2 station headquartered in Australia or Asia,” or seasonally available stations.
* The publication learned form a source that the per-play rate Apple pays the labels for music played on Beats 1 is already “better than Pandora.” Given the power of the Apple and Beats brands and the ubiquitousness of Beats 1 Radio, companies like Pandora and Rdio stand a lot to loose as Apple increases the appeal of Beats 1 and releases additional human-curated Beats stations.
* Interestingly, there has been “no considerable drop in iTunes downloads” due to Apple Music’s launch, though things could easily change down the line—especially as more and more people sign up for Apple Music and buy fewer music downloads as a result of the convenience of all-you-can-eat access to the 30+ million songs on iTunes in exchange of a flat fee of $9.99 per month.
* It remains to be seen whether talk radio and sports-focused programming will help Rdio draw more listeners and advertising dollars. A Nielsen study found that more than 90 percent of U.S. adults listen to radio every week. According to the research firm, adults spend an average of 13 hours a week listening to radio, compared with 29 minutes with streaming audio.
* “If you’ve read the tech press over the last few months, you’d think the tech business invented radio,” Rdio’s chief executive, Anthony Bay, said in an interview. “Radio is still the most widely used form of audio. There’s a big audience out there.”
* In its most recent update, Rdio for iOS has added the ability to tap on the album art in the player to quickly favorite, download, share and more.
* The service has more than 35 million songs to discover, play and share and offers Unlimited tiers ranging from $8.99 per month to $14.99 per month. A $3.99 per month tier offers ad-free stations and 25 downloads at a time.
* The 65.8-megabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. The app is optimized for native display resolution of the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and currently lacks a WatchKit component.
* Download Rdio free of charge from the App Store.
