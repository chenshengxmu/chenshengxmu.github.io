* Following Apple’s action-packed media event yesterday which saw introductions of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones with 3D Display technology, the new iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, the much improved Apple TV and more, both Sony and Samsung took to social media to poke fun of Apple’s latest innovation.
* As you may have guessed, Samsung especially took swipes at Apple’s stylus, which isn’t surprising given Steve Jobs’ famous “If you see a stylus, they blew it” quote and the fact the Galaxy maker pioneered stylus-enhanced phablets with its Note lineup.
* “Ummm… S-Pen #SoundsFamiliar,” reads one of the tweets.

* Another tweet plays on Apple’s ‘Hey Siri’ invite graphics, saying “Siri, what do you think of the Galaxy S6 Edge?”
* https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUK/status/641681912659095552
* Samsung also took jabs at Apple Music and its generous three-month trial period by highlighting its partnership with Google which gives Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge buyers “six months of free streaming instead of three.”

* The company then tweeted out an image of a store display asking “Are you suffering from Post Traumatic Key-Note DIsorder?”

* Lastly, this tweet reads, “It’s clear… No one’s reigning on our parade tonight.”

* Wrapping up, Sony tweeted out Apple’s invite graphics which features the tagline “Hey Sir, give us a hint” and added a message of its own amusingly using the binary code “01000111 01100001 01101101 01100101 00100000 01101111 01101110 00101110” which converted to text reads “Game on.”

* In another tweet, Sony sang praise to its own Xperia Z5 smartphone which has up to two days of battery life and features a 23-megapixel camera with 4K video capture and 4K screen, the world’s first consumer smartphone with a screen that sharp.
* Up to 2 days' battery life, 23 MP camera, 4K video capture AND display… #Xperia Z5 series: http://t.co/n7KuPge34V pic.twitter.com/8kw8HrHALB

* Sony followed that up with another tweet to drive the message home.
* A battery life worth talking about… Up to 2 days’ battery with #Xperia Z5 series: http://t.co/n7KuPge34V pic.twitter.com/ldA7KWYyns

* And lastly, Sony’s most recent tweet suggests that it’s high time iPhone owners switched to the new Xperia smartphone.
* 12 MP camera versus 23 MP camera. Isn’t it time to #SwitchToSony?http://t.co/n7KuPfWrGlhttps://t.co/He4vAucLLh

* What’s your take on these taunts?
* Are these tweets legitimate bashing of a competitor or do they paint Sony and Samsung as petulant and desperate companies, do you think?
