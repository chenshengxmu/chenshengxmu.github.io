* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has added some color to Bloomberg’s report this morning which described an upcoming overhaul of Apple Music in broad strokes. According to Gurman’s sources, the new-look Apple Music section within the stock Music app will be part of the overall iOS 10 refresh and include, among other things, lyrics integration.
* The end-to-end overhaul includes ditching the colorful look in favor of a simpler, black and white design which emphasizes text. For example, the appearance of the albums view will no longer change based on the color of a particular album’s art.
* Also, album artwork will become “huge,” said sources who have seen the updated Apple Music service. More important than that, the redesigned service will incorporate additional 3D Touch shortcut previews on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* It will “better promote the ability to share songs” and make better use of Apple’s in-house San Francisco font. The Connect tab and the Beats 1 Radio service are going to remain mostly unchanged, however.
* “A source said that the greater emphasis on album artwork makes the new service look ‘bolder, yet simpler’”, reads the report. The For You tab should be “simplified” and “better promoted” while the New tab will get replaced with a new Browse section.
* “The Apple Music updates will also expand to the Mac via a minor iTunes update (a larger revamp of iTunes on the Mac is expected by next year) and via a new Apple TV app for models running tvOS,” said Gurman.
* The Cupertino firm is expected to show off these Apple Music improvements at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month. The new-look service will launch for public consumption alongside iOS 10 this fall. Both public and developer betas will be available this summer.
