* The Dev Team has updated its popular jailbreak utility RedSn0w today, bringing the software to version 0.9.15b3. Although it closely follows Apple’s release of iOS 6.0.1, it doesn’t seem to include any 6.0.1-specific changes.
* What it does include, though, are a handful of bug fixes and improvements that should make the jailbreaking process much smoother. We’ve got the full change log after the break…
* From the Dev Team blog:
* “Version 0.9.15b3 fixes the redsn0w “error 2601” that Windows users were seeing using the Restore button.  It also fixes a related Windows iTunes error 14 for stitched files.   Note that if you have a baseband, you should probably avoid stitching and simply use redsn0w’s native Restore (not iTunes). “
* It’s worth noting once again that RedSn0w can only jailbreak a few devices running iOS 6, and even then it’s a tethered hack. So if you haven’t already, make sure you read our State of the iOS 6 Jailbreak post before trying it.
* Regardless, it’s always good to have the latest version of RedSn0w. And as always, you can find it on our Downloads page. For those looking for help with the utility, I’m sure Jeff will be along with a video tutorial on it shortly.
