* Apple on Friday announced (via iGen.fr) grand opening for Apple Watch stores-within-a-store located in high-end department stores in London, Paris and Tokyo. The company’s UK Retail website confirms that the Selfridges Apple Watch shop will open doors to business on Friday, April 10, at 9am local time.
* Located on London’s 400 Oxford Street, the Selfridges shop is just across the popular Wonder Room shopping hall where a bunch of watch brands and jewelers operate their luxury shops. Apple previously said pre-orders for the wearable device will kick off on April 10.
* The Wonder Room shopping hall, pictured below, near the Selfridges Apple Watch shop, is “a unique destination that plays host to the world’s most desirable brands,” including Tag Heuer, Bvlgari, Gucci, Cariter, Montblanc and Longines.
