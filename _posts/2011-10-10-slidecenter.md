* What do you get when you mix a slideshow with iOS 5’s Notification Center? You get SlideCenter. That’s right, there’s little creativity in the naming department these days.
* SlideCenter allows you to stream all of the photos from your iPhone’s Camera Roll, right into Notification Center.
* Check out the entire video demonstration after the break…
* SlideCenter is still in beta, but I already have a wish list of improvements that will hopefully be bestowed upon this promising widget.
* First, I’d like to see PhotoStream support; as of now, it only streams content from the on-device Camera Roll.
* Secondly, there’s no way to skip photos, or anything else; once it’s set in motion, it just keeps looping.
* Despite those few shortcomings, SlideCenter shows promise; it’s good to remember that the widget is still in beta. If you want to try it out in its current iteration, add the BigBoss beta repo to your list of Cydia sources: http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/
* I’m interested to hear your thoughts and ideas regarding SlideCenter. Do you think it shows promise? let me know in the comments below.
