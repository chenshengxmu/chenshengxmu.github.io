* The Absinthe jailbreak for iPhone 4S and iPad 2 was released a few minutes ago. Of course, we were right on it and we already posted a tutorial on how to jailbreak the iPhone 4S or iPad 2 using Absinthe.
* While I haven’t had any problem running the jailbreak – well, I had it a few minutes before everybody else – it appears that some users are having a problem when launching the Absinthe app installed on their device, which returns an “error establishing a database connection“.
* We have a fix for that…
* iOS hacker PlanetBeing who helped develop the jailbreak tweeted a simple fix for the “error establishing a database connection”. Apparently, all you need to do is go to Settings > Network > VPN > ON.
* The VPN connection will most likely give an error and your iPhone 4S or iPad 2 should reboot shortly after. Once it’s rebooted, try launching the Absinthe webclip again.
* Let us know if that works for you.
