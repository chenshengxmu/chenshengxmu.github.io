* Samsung Display, the display-making unit of Samsung Electronics which holds a 95 percent market share for smartphone OLED panels, should exclusively build curved OLED screens for iPhone 8 during the next two years. The Korea Herald suggested Monday that other South Korean firms have won important contracts for iPhone 8, too.
* While Samsung Display will build the OLEDs for iPhone 8 itself, the company will play a vital role in procuring related components from four other Korean vendors.
* “Apple will seek to diversify suppliers for the OLED model but Samsung Display and its key suppliers will dominate the supply chain for some time,” said an industry source.
* Other Korean suppliers mentioned in the report include:
* Samsung’s System LSI is estimated to earn about 480 billion won, or approximately $422 million, from the display driver integrated circuit supply to Apple.
* The report is interesting given that Apple usually diversifies suppliers of key parts.
* Tim Cook & Co. relying on other Korean vendors for key iPhone 8 components could mean that suppliers from Taiwan and China have failed to meet Apple’s exacting standards of quality due to iPhone 8’s technological sophistication.
