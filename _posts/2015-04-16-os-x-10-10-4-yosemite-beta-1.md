* Thursday, Apple seeded the first beta of the upcoming OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 software update to its Mac developers, as first reported by MacRumors. Registered Mac developers can grab the installer manually through Apple’s portal for developers, or automatically, using the OS X Software Update Seed Configuration Utility.
* We’ll be reporting on any interesting new features, changes and enhancements in OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 beta 1 as we encounter them.
* The first beta of the OS X 10.10.4 software update has arrived just a week following the public release of the OS X 10.10.3 software update.
* Among a handful of performance improvements, bug fixes and little enhancements, one of the headline new features of OS X 10.10.3 was the all-new Photos for Mac app which has completed Apple’s photo management solution across iOS, OS X and the web.

* Apple’s official seed notes accompanying the download don’t mention anything of importance beyond stating that the OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 update improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.
* The new beta carries a build number of 14E7f.
* The software can be downloaded from the Mac Developer Center.
* Earlier this morning, Apple released a supplemental update OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 update fixing a video driver issue that may have prevented some Macs to boot up properly when specific video capture apps were used.
* And earlier this week, the company has made the first beta of iOS 8.4 available to registered iOS developers. The forthcoming software update includes a redesigned Music app that our own Jeff Benjamin detailed in his video hands-on.
