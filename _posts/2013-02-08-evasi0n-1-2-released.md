* The evad3rs have sure been busy this week. On Monday they released version 1.0 of their jailbreak utility, and on Wednesday they rolled out version 1.1 with fixes for the Weather app and long reboot bugs.
* Today, they’ve posted a second update to evasi0n, bringing it to version 1.2. The new update features built-in code to disable future OTA updates on your jailbroken device, and a fix for the timezone issue…
* Here are the full change logs from the three evasi0n releases this week:
* Version 1.2
* Version 1.1
* Version 1.0
* The new ‘disable OTA’ function in today’s update is actually quite handy, as it will keep you from accidentally agreeing to install an update on your iPhone and possibly killing your jailbreak. And for those experiencing the timezone bug, I’m sure the fix is a welcome addition as well.
* Of course, if you are already jailbroken and everything is working fine, there’s really no need to re-jailbreak. But if for some reason you want to, or you just haven’t yet, you can find the latest version of evasi0n on our Downloads page.
* Those of you who have already jailbroken their device using evasi0n will see an update for the evasi0n 6.0-6.1 Untether package in Cydia. Version 0.3-1 of the package also disables the OTA update daemons so the Settings app will not prompt you to update to iOS 6.1.1 when it comes out – note that OTA updates don’t work anyway for devices that are jailbroken.
* If you haven’t jailbroken yet, don’t forget we have tutorials on how to jailbreak all of your iOS devices on both Mac and Windows platforms.
