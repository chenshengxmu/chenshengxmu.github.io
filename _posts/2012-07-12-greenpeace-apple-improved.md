* Apple has been taking a lot of heat regarding its environmental policies over the past week. This due to the news that the company has recently pulled its products from the EPEAT registry.
* But despite the fact that its products will no longer be EPEAT-certified, environmental groups say that Apple’s ‘green’ polices are improving. Greenpeace, in fact, just upped the company’s CEI score…
* CEI stands for Clean Energy Index, and it’s a system that measures companies on their commitment to using renewable energy (aka solar power) versus non-renewable (like coal).
* Greenpeace has upped Apple’s CEI score to 22.6%, up from 15.3% in April. The organization says that with its plans to build large solar farms to support its upcoming data centers, Apple is on the right track to a coal-free future.
* But that doesn’t mean that the Cupertino company doesn’t still have some work to do. In Greenpeace’s new report, the group outlines a number of steps Apple can take if it really wants wants to make a positive impact on the environment:
* Apple is currently building, or looking to build, massive data centers in three different states: California, Oregon and Nevada. Combine these projects with the company’s ‘spaceship’ campus, and it’s easy to see why folks are concerned with Apple’s impact on the environment.
* We forget, sometimes, all of the things that go into building and maintaining services like iCloud and Siri.
