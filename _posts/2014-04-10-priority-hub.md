* Looking for a better way to sort your Lock screen notifications on iOS 7? Then try out Priority Hub, a new Blackberry 10 inspired jailbreak tweak that just landed on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Priority Hub allows users to group Lock screen notifications by app, allowing one to easily see notifications pertaining to a single app at a time. It’s a great way to simplify the iOS 7 Lock screen and make it easier to read at a glance.
* We’ve taken Priority Hub for a test drive via our hands-on video walkthrough. Check past the jump for the full scoop.
* Once you install Priority Hub, you’ll find a new preference panel located in the stock Settings app. Inside of Priority Hub’s preferences, you’ll spot two options—show numbers, and icon location. The show numbers toggle allows you to display a tally of all of notifications for each app right on the Lock screen. The icon location panel allows you to move the app icons associated with the notifications to the top or bottom of the Lock screen.

* Priority Hub is a very simple tweak, but it makes Lock screen notifications much easier to manage if you tend to receive a lot of them. For each app associated with a notification, you’ll see an app icon located on your Lock screen. Every notification pertaining to that app can be accessed by tapping on the app icon.
* You can hide or switch between notifications by tapping on an app icon. You can clear all notifications associated with a specific app by using a pull down gesture. Using Priority Hub is intuitive and sensible; it’s well thought-out and genuinely useful.
* If you’d like to try Priority Hub, you can do so right now via Cydia’s BigBoss repo. This tweak is certainly worth at least $0.99, but the developer, Thomas Finch, decided to make it available free of charge as a nice gesture to the community. What do you think about Priority Hub?
