* A couple weeks ago, Samsung spent big bucks to play a commercial during the Super Bowl for their latest device: the Galaxy Note, a 5.3-inch phablet (phone/tablet), powered by a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, and 16GB of built-in memory. Oh yes, and I almost forgot. It also comes with a stylus!
* The guys over at Joy of Tech imagined what would happen if an iPhone met a Samsung Note. Quite entertaining, and perfect to start the day on a funny noteâ€¦
* For those of you interested in reading more about the Galaxy Note, Walt Mossberg has a pretty good review up.
