title: Spirit Jailbreak for iPhone,iPad and iPod Touch Coming Tomorrow
---
* A few weeks ago I was telling you about Spirit, a new userland jailbreak by Comex that would supposedly jailbreak all iPhones and iPod Touch 3.1.3, no matter what model, as well as the iPad 3.1.2.

* After a month of painful wait, the official realease date finally came from Comex himself. When someone asked him on Twitter when we could expect his Spirit jailbreak to be released, Comex said “Friday”.
* It is pretty unclear what Spirit will look like. It was originally believed to be a browser-based jailbreak like jailbreakme.com but Chpwn confirmed a few hours ago that Spirit doesn’t work out of a browser. He also made it clear that Spirit will work for the latest firmware of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.
* That is indeed good news for some of us who “accidentally” updated to 3.1.3 and got stuck without a jailbreak. It’s important to note that Spirit is a jailbreak only. It will not unlock your iPhone! There is no word about a 3.1.3 iPhone unlock and if I were you, I wouldn’t hold my breath. I suspect we won’t see a 3.1.3 unlock until iPhone OS 4 is released in a few weeks.
* If you’re going to be using Spirit for your iDevice, MuscleNerd recommended NOT to update iTunes to the latest 9.1.1 version. According to MuscleNerd, iTunes can detect Spirit and remove it, so make sure you stay away from this “update” button.
* I just got my iPad and I was feeling really miserable without all my jailbreak apps. I’m glad I’m going to be able to take full advantage of this beautiful device as soon as I jailbreak it with Spirit.
* What about you? Are you excited?
