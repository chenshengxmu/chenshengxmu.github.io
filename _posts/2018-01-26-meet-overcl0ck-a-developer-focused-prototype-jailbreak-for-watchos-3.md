* There’ve been countless jailbreak tools for iPhones and iPads over the years, but we’ve never really seen one for the Apple Watch since it first debuted in 2015. On the other hand, that could change very soon.
* iOS developer PsychoTea published the first beta of an Apple Watch-oriented jailbreak tool to GitHub on Friday. Dubbed OverCl0ck, it’s an early prototype and could potentially change how users interact with Apple’s premier wearable device.

* We don’t know much about the OverCl0ck Apple Watch jailbreak tool just yet, but we do know that it supports watchOS 3 and that it utilizes Seguza’s V0rtex kernel exploit to work its magic.
* PsychoTea admits that he isn’t entirely sure about device compatibility or if the tool even works. That said, it might only work on specific Apple Watch models. Obviously, it wouldn’t work on the Series 3 because it ships with watchOS 4 from the factory.
* OverCl0ck is a work in progress, so it’s not intended for average or novice jailbreakers to use in its current form. Rather it’s a way for curious developers to tinker with watchOS and discover new and exciting ways to customize the user experience.
* Should the tool ever materialize into something, PsychoTea says he could develop some sort of package manager for installing Apple Watch-based tweaks. The concept would be like Cydia in many ways but on a much smaller scale.
* As it would seem, OverCl0ck is merely a preliminary release intended to probe the community’s interest in modding the Apple Watch. There are no guarantees that OverCl0ck will become the next big thing or that it’ll support future watchOS versions, so take it with a grain of salt.
