title: Apple offering up a discount on Beats Pill+ speaker and Beats EP headphones
---
* Apple finally began accepting online orders for AirPods today. There’s also bad news as the company delayed the W1-outfitted BeatsX wireless earphones until February 2017.

* To appease would-be BeatsX/AirPods buyers, Apple is now offering a discount on a pair of Beats-branded audio products: Beats Pill+ Speaker and Beats EP Headphones, as noted by MacRumors.
* Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker, regularly $230, is currently available for $199—a savings of $30. The miniature yet powerful speaker is available in White, Red and Black.
* Beats EP On-Ear Headphones, which come in Blue, White, Black and Red, went from $130 down to $100. Other retailers may offer deeper discounts than Apple.
* Amazon, for instance, has price-matched Apple so you can pick up your Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker from them for $100 if you like. The Beats EP On-Ear Headphones, interestingly enough, are still $130 via Amazon.
