* Looking for a case for that new iPhone SE you’re getting later this week? Apple has you covered. The company on Monday introduced a new leather case for its just-announced handset. It comes in colors Black and Midnight Blue, and Apple says it’s compatible with older iPhone 5 and 5s models.
* This is good news for folks hoping to use their old iPhone 5/5s cases on the new iPhone SE. We’ve known that the dimensions on the different phone models are the same, 4.87 in (123.8 mm) x 2.31 in (58.6 mm) x 0.30 in (7.6 mm), but this is the first time Apple has confirmed case compatibility.

* Additionally, Apple also released new colorways for its iPhone 6s/Plus silicon and leather cases today. Choices now include White, Stone, Yellow, Apricot, Light Pink, Antique White, Midnight Blue, Lavender, Lilac, Royal Blue, Mint, Charcoal Gray, Orange and Red, and they start shipping Wednesday.
* For those who missed the announcement this morning, Apple today unveiled its long rumored 4-inch handset it’s calling the iPhone SE. It has a 4-inch display, and its design looks nearly identical to the iPhone 5s, but it features the same processor and other internal components as more recent iPhones.
