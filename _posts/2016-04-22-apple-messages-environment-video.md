* Apple yesterday published a cool new video on its YouTube channel that does a very good job explaining to the general public, in layman’s terms, its renewable energy strides.
* The 45-second clip is all about iMessage, Apple’s own messaging service that’s built right into the stock Messages application on iOS and OS X.
* With an average of tens of billions of iMessages hitting Apple’s data centers on any given day, the Cupertino firm wanted to make it clear that the impact on our environment is negligible because Apple’s servers run on 100 percent renewable energy.
* “Every time you send an iMessage, you’re showing some love for the Earth,” says Apple.
* Watch the video embedded below.
* Let us know how you liked Apple’s latest environment message down in the comments.
