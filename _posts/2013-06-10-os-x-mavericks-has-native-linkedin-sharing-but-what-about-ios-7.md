* Apple has shared a bunch of software-focused updates during today’s WWDC keynote, but only briefly touched on a few topics dear to my heart, due to time constraints. Among them: native LinkedIn sharing. As you know, OS X Mountain Lion already incorporates single sign-on for Facebook and Twitter. Truth be told, the company did make a passing mention of LinkedIn integration during the keynote’s Safari segment and it would only seem natural that it will be bringing that capability to iOS 7 in the betas preceding a Fall release…
* According to a What’s New page on Apple’s portal for developers (via @floo1989), LinkedIn lets developers write apps that log you into LinkedIn using your credentials stored in System Preferences.
* Make it easy for users to post links and access their LinkedIn profiles directly from your app. With single sign-on in OS X Mavericks, users can sign into their account once and stay connected with their professional networks.
* It’s unclear whether LinkedIn extends to OS X Mavericks’s system-wide share menu. For what it’s worth, I learned a week ago from my own sources that iOS 7 would bring native LinkedIn sharing.
* Also heard: in addition to Flickr and Vimeo integration, Apple is also testing native LinkedIn sharing (like Twitter and Facebook in iOS 6)

* The Jony Ive thing didn’t transpire and my source has a sketchy track record so I’d take this with a few pinches of salt. But with LinkedIn support in OS X Mavericks, it’s certainly a matter of time before the feature makes its way to iOS 7.
* @markgurman Nice! but where’s my Vimeo icon?

* For the record, 9to5Mac first called for native Flickr and Vimeo integration in iOS 7.
* Apple’s promo graphics shown above certainly proves that at least the Flickr part of the rumor panned out.

* Mark’s sources are much better than mine and he just chimed in on Twitter confirming that both Flickr and Vimeo sections are available in iOS 7 Settings – but not LinkedIn (yet).
* Flickr AND Vimeo are both here in Settings – Source

* Indeed, here’s a screenie (via Sjoerd Reitsma).

* So, what’s your take?
* Will LinkedIn integration come to iOS 7 come this Fall?
