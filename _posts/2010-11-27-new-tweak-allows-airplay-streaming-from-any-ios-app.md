* AirPlay just got the jailbreak treatment. AirPlay (one of Apple’s new technologies in iOS 4.2) allows streaming video to be pushed from any iOS device to an Apple TV.
* AirPlay is only intended to allow streaming from the iPod and YouTube app, but this new jailbreak tweak opens up AirPlay possibilities to any playable media on an iOS device…
* “AirVideoEnabler” allows streaming to Apple TV using AirPlay from any application, including Safari. That means that any iOS compatible media on the web is available for AirPlay streaming.
* You can add this free tweak in Cydia from this repo: “http://cydia.zone-mr.net”
* Watch this video demonstration of AirVideoEnabler and see how well it works.
* The developer is clear in the description for AirVideoEnabler, “Note that this unreleased feature has its quirks – not all content will stream without glitches.” However, I would say that, for the most part, this is a pretty sweet hack for a jailbreaker with an Apple TV.
* What do you think? Have you tried this tweak out? Let us know if you notice any bugs.
