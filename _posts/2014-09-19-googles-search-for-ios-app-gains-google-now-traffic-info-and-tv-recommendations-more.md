* The Internet giant Google on Friday refreshed its native Google Search application for the iPhone and iPad with enhancements to the built-in Google Now feature in the form of new cards for personalized TV recommendations and traffic information.
* Furthermore, version 4.2 of Google Search for iOS now includes better Chromecast integration allowing owners of the $35 HDMI dongle to ask Google “what’s on Chromecast?” to open the Chromecast for iPhone app and start casting.
* The app also includes the usual bug fixes and improvements “to speed up your browsing experience” and has now been renamed to just ‘Google’.
* Keep in mind you’ll need to sign in to the app with your Google Account in order to enable Now cards and take full advantage of these new features and personalization.
* Google Search 4.2 changelog:
* The 36.1-megabyte app works natively on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
