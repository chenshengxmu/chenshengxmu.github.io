* Following its announcement of the long-rumored iPad Pro, Apple introduced two new accessories for the 12.9-inch tablet. The first is the keyboard, which you can read about here, and the second is a stylus accessory that the company is calling the ‘Apple Pencil.’
* Apple used a traditional Jony Ive-voiceover video to unveil the Pencil, with the newly-appointed Chief Design Officer saying “Apple Pencil is designed to look and feel like a familiar tool. Highly responsive sensors built into Pencil can sense pressure, tilt, and stroke.”

* The stylus’ precision accuracy gives you the ability to touch a single pixel, and Apple says it can be used simultaneously with your finger on the display. Its built-in battery can “last for hours,” and you charge it by simply plugging it into the iPad Pro’s Lightning connector.
* The Apple Pencil will cost $99, and will be available alongside the iPad Pro sometime in November.
