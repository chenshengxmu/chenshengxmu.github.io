* The iPhone’s App Switcher has gotten a bit long in the tooth, but if you’re a jailbreaker, there’s no shortage of tweaks that can help improve the app switching experience.
* Switchy is the latest tweak to do that, and it’s based on a concept design created by Brent Caswell. Caswell’s beef with the current App Switcher stems from the fact that it takes up too much real estate, while providing minimal functionality.
* Going into the concept, he apparently had no idea that a Cydia developer would turn his work into reality, but a few days later and Switchy lives. That’s evident of how awesome the jailbreak community can be when it works together to implement new ideas…
* Switchy implements the basic features of Caswell’s concept, but it’s still missing some of the more notable features like a Spotlight search bar, Pandora buttons, service toggles, etc.
* It’s a great start that looks largely like the concept posted on The Verge forums, but it doesn’t pack the punch that it could, due to the missing features.
* I’m not convinced that Switchy is worth $1.00 at this point, but you be the judge after taking a look at our video walkthrough.
* What do you think?
