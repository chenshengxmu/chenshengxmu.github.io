* Are you one to use stopwatches or timers frequently? If so, then you might like the convenience of a new jailbreak tweak release called Simple Timer (iOS 10) by iOS developer NeinZedd9.
* This tweak speeds up your access to handy stopwatch and timer functions from the Lock screen by letting you bypass the stock gestures in Control Center entirely.
* On a stock device, getting to the stopwatch or timer in the Clock app is typically a several-step process:
* After installing Simple Timer (iOS 10), on the other hand, these features are never more than a single gesture away and you can avoid any unwanted delays.
* To use the tweak, you’ll need to understand its gesture set. There are a few to remember, but it only takes about a minute or so to become acquainted with them. Gestures performed to the left of the Lock screen clock invoke stopwatch-based features, while gestures performed to the right of the Lock screen clock invoke timer-based functions.
* All the gestures you can use with Simple Timer (iOS 10) include the following:
* Stopwatch:

* Among the things you can do here are:
* All settings take effect immediately after setting them without the need to respring your device. That said, you can quickly go back and forth to see how you like each setting.
* If you were to ask me what I thought about Simple Timer (iOS 10), I’d say that I like the concept. A lot of times when you need a stopwatch or a timer, the stock iOS shortcut is too many gestures away to get to the controls in time. Simple Timer (iOS 10) solves that problem by being quick and easy to get to.
* Moreover, Simple Timer (iOS 10) has several options to tinker with that iOS doesn’t offer out of the box, such as custom decimal options and quirky animations and haptic feedback.
* If you’re interested in giving Simple Timer (iOS 10) a try, you can download the tweak for just $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is intended to work on jailbroken iOS 10 devices only.
