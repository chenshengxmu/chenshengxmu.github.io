* Although we won’t likely see a new iPhone at WWDC next week, it is on the way. The handset is reportedly scheduled to go into production this month, and is expected to be unveiled during a September or October event.
* We know little about the device, believed to be the iPhone 5S, outside of the fact that it is going to look like its predecessor. We have seen a number of minor part leaks though, with a few more turning up this morning…
* Earlier today, Nowhereelse.fr reposted these photos from iColorOS of what are believed to be iPhone 5S parts. There’s both a gold and silver-colored SIM card tray, and what appears to be volume, mute, and power buttons.

* Some pundits think that the gold-colored SIM part may be confirmation of the theory that the next iPhone will come in a multitude of new colors. Multiple reports thus far have stated the device won’t come in just black and white.
* While there’s no way to confirm these components belong to Apple’s next handset, it’s worth noting that Nowhereelse.fr does have a good track record with part leaks. And it says the same of iColor, so that obviously adds weight.
* Also worth noting here is the fact that we have seen a gold SIM card tray before, in a similar context. Photos of gold and gray SIM card trays surfaced online back in April, with the poster claiming it belonged to Apple’s next handset.
* Again, not much is really known about the so-called iPhone 5S at this point. Industry speculation suggests the device will feature the usual internal upgrades, as well as a better camera system and possibly a built-in fingerprint sensor. But we’ve seen little evidence of the claims.
