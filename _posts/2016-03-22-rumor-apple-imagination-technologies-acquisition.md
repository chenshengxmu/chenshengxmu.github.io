* Ars Technica reported this morning that Apple is in “advanced talks” regarding a possible takeover of British fabless semiconductor maker Imagination Technologies. The chip designer develops GPU blueprints that other companies license and incorporate into their own chips.
* Apple owns at least a 9.5 percent stake in Imagination and has long used their PowerVR line of graphics-processing units (GPU) inside its own A-series processors since the emergence of the A4 chip, which powered the original iPad, the iPhone 4 and the fourth-generation iPod touch.
* Imagination refused to deny any such planned takeover.
* Apple debunked the report in a statement to CNBC, saying it doesn’t plan to make an offer to buy Imagination. However, Apple has acknowledged that it “did hold some talks” with the British company.
* If Apple succeeds in buying Imagination, the company is going to take its GPU destiny into its own hands and fully control all aspects of its in-house chip design. Since the A7 chip three years ago, the world’s first 64-bit mobile processor, Apple has been designing its fully customized CPU cores based on the ARM instruction set.
* As for the graphics cores inside Apple’s iPhone, iPad and iPod processors, Apple typically licenses Imagination’s PowerVR designs with slight modifications for improved performance and reduced power consumption.
* Imagination has been trying to diversify into other areas like MIPS processors, chips for servers and ray tracing GPUs, to no avail. Last week, the British firm announced a significant restructuring program after its longtime CEO Hossein Lassie stepped down amid declining average royalty rates.
* The company is now expecting to post an operating loss for the year to the end of April.
* “This swift and decisive action will put us back on a sound financial footing and will enable us to have the necessary resources to further strengthen our three core businesses,” the company’s interim chief executive Andrew Heath said in a statement.
* “The ongoing operational review will identify clearly where we need to focus, building on our current strengths and allocating the right capital to ensure growth and attractive returns.”
* 350 jobs were already axed in the process and now Imagination will be doubling-down on PowerVR technology. Back in 2014, Apple has extended its agreement with Imagination which gave it multi-year access to all future PowerVR-branded video and GPU designs.
* The A9X chip that powers the iPad Pro includes Imagination’s Series7XT GPU cores.
