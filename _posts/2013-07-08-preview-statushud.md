* StatusHUD is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that promises to integrate the iPhone’s volume HUD with the status bar. This allows you to view the volume level meter from within the confines of the iOS status bar, keeping the middle of the screen free from the stock HUD.
* Scheduled to touchdown on Cydia’s BigBoss repo in the near future, StatusHUD works on all jailbroken iOS devices, including the iPad. Developer, Alan Yip, the same developer behind tweaks such as Tap to Widgets and Overview, has allowed us to go hands on with a finished copy of the tweak. Check out our preview video after the break…
* StatusHUD will be available for $0.99 on Cydia. There are more options included with the tweak, and we’ll go in depth with those and provide more detailed analysis once it touches down. In the meantime, share your thoughts about StatusHUD in the comment section below.
