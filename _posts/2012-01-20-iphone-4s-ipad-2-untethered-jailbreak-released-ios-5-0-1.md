* It’s here! The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1 was just released after months of anticipation, and months of hard work by pod2g and the rest of the leaders in the jailbreak community.
* A huge thanks is owed to the dream team of hackers including pod2g, p0sixninja, MuscleNerd, planetbeing, Saurik, and no-doubt countless others.
* Take a look inside for more details surrounding this groundbreaking moment…
* Facts: This is the first jailbreak, untethered or otherwise for the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 4S was released last October, so it took about 3 months for a jailbreak to come to fruition.
* This is the second jailbreak for the iPad 2. The first was Comex’s Jailbreakme for iOS 4.3.3. It took a bit over 4 months for the first iPad jailbreak to be released, so the iPhone 4S jailbreak was actually released fairly quick.
* The iOS 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak is compatible with the following:
* As previously noted, there will be three jailbreak tools released that are all capable of jailbreaking the iPhone 4S and iPad 2. They are as follows:
* So far, only Absinthe for Mac is available. A Windows version is in the works and should be released shortly. The Dev Team’s CLI shouldn’t be too far away either. We’ll keep you informed as news come.
* Head over to our downloads page and download Absinthe now. We’ll be following up shortly with a full tutorial that shows you how to jailbreak your iPhone 4S and iPad 2 using this new tool, along with the Command Line Interface tool (CLI) from the iPhone Dev Team.
* Excited much?
