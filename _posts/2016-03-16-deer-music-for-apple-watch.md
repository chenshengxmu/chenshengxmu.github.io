* Deezer, a cross-platform music streaming service, is now available on your Apple Watch as a native app.
* The new watchOS 2 app lets you access your favorite music, use Deezer’s Flow feature, see the latest hits and access Deezer’s personalized mixes, all with the flick of your wrist.
* On iOS devices, Deezer now provides lots of new recommendations to your Flow feed and lets users unlink devices connected to their Deezer account using the mobile app.
* Deezer for Apple Watch is basically your magic wrist jukebox for the iOS app running on the paired iPhone. It lets you access Flow, My Music, Charts and Mixes as well as any songs you have downloaded to your phone for offline listening.
