* iOS 11 is scheduled to release tomorrow, Tuesday, September 19, ahead of the iPhone 8 launch on Friday, September 22. While Apple’s latest and greatest operating system drops support for 32-bit apps and non-64-bite hardware like iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, the great news is that any 64-bit Apple device that runs iOS 10 can now run iOS 11 as well.
* Here are Apple’s release notes for iOS 11:
* These are not the only iOS 11 features because Apple’s official changelogs often omit minor enhancements. As an example, iOS 11 brings native FLAC playback to iPhone 7, iPhone 8 and iPhone X although the official release notes don’t mention FLAC support.
* Keep in mind that some features may not be available for all countries or all areas. For more information, visit Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage. For detailed information on the security content of this update, check out Apple’s support document.
* To update to iOS 11, you’ll need the following:
* You should create a full backup of your device in iTunes or iCloud before updating to iOS 11. Double-check that you have your Apple ID password and device passcode handy.
* If you have a passcode set up on your device, you will need to type it in before updating to iOS 11. And after you update, you’ll need to sign in with your Apple ID user name and password to use services like iCloud and App Store and access your content like contacts, calendars, photos and videos stored in iCloud Photo Library and more.
* Apple states that iOS 11 is compatible with these devices:
* iOS 11 does not support iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPad 4, iPad mini and older devices.
* What’s your favorite feature in iOS 11 so far, and why? And while we’re at it, will you be upgrading your devices to iOS 11 on day one, or perhaps at a later date?
