* Things have started to get out of hand very quickly with iPhone concepts over the last few months, so we decided to slow down our coverage of them. As a matter of fact, I don’t believe we’ve published one iPhone concept since last June.
* Today we’re making an exception for this iPhone 6 concept by Arthur Reis…
* The design is directly inspired from the iPad mini and I must say it looks gorgeous. If the next iPhone looks anything like this, I’m sold! I suggest you don’t pay much attention to the dream specs but rather focus on the design of the this iPhone concept.
* You can see more photos of this concept on Reis’ Flickr.
* What do you think?
