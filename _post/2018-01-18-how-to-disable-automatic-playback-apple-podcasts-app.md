* If you rely on Apple’s stock Podcasts app to keep up with iDownloadBlog’s Let’s Talk iOS podcast and other favorite shows on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, the iOS 11.2 software update has you covered with a handy new continuous playback option.
* With iOS 11.2 or later, the Podcasts app defaults to automatically advancing to the next episode from the same show, which is fine if all you want is catch up to your favorite podcast.
* But if you’d rather listen to specific episodes without having to worry about excess cellular data usage or prefer to manually advance to the next episode, consider turning this feature off.
* Here’s how…
* To stop the Apple Podcasts app from automatically playing the next episode of a show or station after the episode you’re currently listening to ends, follow the step-by-step instructions:
* 1) Open the Settings app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* 2) Choose Podcasts from the list.
* 3) Disable the option Continuous Playback underneath the Podcasts Settings heading.

* When this option is turned off, the app will not automatically advance to the next episode from the same show when the episode you’re currently listening to ends.
* And that’s all there’s to it!
