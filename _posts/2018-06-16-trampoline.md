* Trampoline is a new free jailbreak tweak by iOS developer Patrick that gives your iOS device a revised app-launching/closing animation; and just as the name suggests, it’s quite springy.
* In the animated GIF example embedded below, you can see for yourself how the tweak influences this animation:

* The springiness in the animation displayed above is more exaggerated than you’d expect on a stock device. It’s purely cosmetic by nature, but the quirkiness it adds to your handset makes it stand out from everyone else’s and gets you noticed.
* The concept behind Trampoline isn’t new, as it follows the footsteps of a community favorite called %hook’s law, but the constant rebirth of this particular animation with every new jailbreak season underscores its popularity within the jailbreak community.
* Trampoline doesn’t come with any options to configure as of this writing, but conversations on /r/jailbreak indicate that the developer intends to change that in a future update along with support for wallpaper-centric effects.
* If you’d like to give Trampoline a try in its current form, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Are you a fan of the springy app-launching/closing animations brought about by Trampoline? Let us know in the comments below.
