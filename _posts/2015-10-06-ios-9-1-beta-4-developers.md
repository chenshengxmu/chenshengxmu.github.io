* Apple on Tuesday seeded the fourth beta version of iOS 9.1 to developers. The software is available to registered developers either over-the-air, for those running the latest iOS 9.1 beta, or via Apple’s developer website.
* Today’s release comes less than one week after beta 3 was made available to developers, and a month after iOS 9.1 was first introduced during Apple’s iPhone 6s event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.
* For those who haven’t been following the developer releases, iOS 9.1 brings about a handful of new features such as support for the incoming iPad Pro accessories and Unicode 8, which includes a number of new emoji.
* We’re currently installing today’s 9.1 beta, and will let you know if we spot any major changes. If you see something we missed that you feel is worth noting, let us know in the comments below or at tips@idownloadblog.com.
* If you’re not a developer, Apple is offering a public beta of iOS 9.1. There’s no word on when the company plans to release a final version of the software, but we should see it sometime this month alongside the new Apple TV.
