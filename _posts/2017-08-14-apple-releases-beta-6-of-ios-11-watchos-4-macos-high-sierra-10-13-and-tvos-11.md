* Apple on Monday released macOS High Sierra 10.13 beta 6, iOS 11 beta 6, watchOS 4 beta 6, and tvOS 11 beta 6 to registered developers. This new round of beta software comes a week after the release of beta 5 for these platforms.
* If you’re a developer with a device already running a previous beta version of iOS 11, you can upgrade to iOS 11 beta 6 (build number 15J5360b) over the air using the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app.
* While we’re digging into new features and changes in beta 6, you can catch up with all that was new in beta 5 in this video:
* Along with iOS 11 beta 6, Apple today seeded watchOS 4 beta 6 (build number 15R5357b) to the registered developers and members of its developer program.
* If you’re a developer and would like to install watchOS 4 beta 6 on your Apple Watch over the air, tap My Watch → General → Software Update in the Watch app on your paired iPhone.
* Non-developers are not permitted to test the software because the company’s official public beta-testing program currently does not support the watchOS platform.
* You can watch everything that was new in watchOS 4 beta 5 in this video:
* An over-the-air macOS High Sierra beta 6 (build number 17A344b) download is available through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. The full installer can be grabbed from Apple’s Dev Center portal for developers.
* The iPhone maker today released a sixth beta (build number 15J5360b) of the upcoming tvOS 11 software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV to its registered developers and members of the paid Apple Developer Program, ahead of its scheduled release in the fall.
* Feel free to let us know either here in the comments or on Twitter @iDownloadBlog should you find something new and noteworthy in these releases.
