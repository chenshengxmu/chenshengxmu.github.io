* Last night, the online retail giant Amazon has begun airing the first television commercial for its Fire smartphone ahead of its debut next Friday in the United States.
* Rather than take jabs at competitors as Amazon did with its launch ads for the Fire tablets, the Fire Phone commercial instead zeroes in on the fact that it comes with a full year of Prime membership, bundled free of charge.
* It’s a major selling point which cleverly takes advantage of Amazon’s diverse interests in digital media and its continuos focus on undercutting the value proposition of its rivals…
* The ad depicts a pair of kids having fun with their Fire Phones in a coffee shop and enjoying popular apps like Minecraft, Twitter and Pinterest.
* After one of the kids remarks that the device includes a free 1-year Prime subscription, the other one tells his mother, “I’ve been on this earth nine years and I’ve never seen anything like it.”
* Here, check it out below.

* Introduced today a month ago, the Fire Phone has a Gorila Glass 3 screen measuring 4.7 inches diagonally, runs a 2.2GHz quad-core chip with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 330 graphics and has a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera.
* Running a forked version of Android called Fire OS 3.5, it sports several interesting technologies such as a 3D adaptive perspective mode, ASAP predictive caching, MayDay support, screen mirroring and much more.
* The Fire Phone is set to launch next Friday, July 25, as an AT&T exclusive.
* The device comes with Amazon’s Firefly technology which allows it to recognize more than 100 million movies, songs, products, books and more. It’s basically like Shazam, only for all kinds of digital media.

* Although Fire Phone customers get treated to a full year of Prime benefits, it’s a limited-time offer. What if you purchase the phone and are already a Prime subscriber? Easy, Amazon will extend your membership for a full year.
* For $99 per year, the Prime subscription bundles unlimited streaming of over one million songs, access to Amazon’s Prime Instant Video library of over 40,000 movies and TV episodes, free two-day shipping and other perks, like giving Kindle-owning customers ability to rent 500,000 e-books.
* What did you think of the Fire Phone ad?
