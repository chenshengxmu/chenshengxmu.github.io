* Apple’s federal e-book babysitter was named Wednesday. New York Judge Denise Cote assigned former Department of Just Inspector General Michael Bromwich to monitor Apple’s compliance with antitrust laws concerning e-book sales. In July, Apple agreed to an independent monitor after being found guilt of conspiring with five publishers to fix prices.
* Although Apple has called such a monitor unnecessary, DoJ prosecutors demanded the step as part of the final court remedy. Judge Cote, however, threw Apple a bone, reducing Bromwich’s monitoring duty to just two years, less than half of the five years the Justice Department had originally wanted…
* According to CNET, before joining the DOJ, Bromwich served a similar role in 2002 as independent monitor of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC.
* He also served as the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. In 2002, he was a federal lawyer which helped prosecute the United State government’s case against Col. Oliver North.
* In July, Apple was ordered not to enter into any ‘most-favored-nation’ agreements (see Wikipedia) with e-book publishers, or any other content provider. During the settlement negotiations, DoJ lawyers reduced their initial demand that the injunction last ten years to only five.

* Judge Cote has now trimmed that even further.
* The move is in line with her earlier pledge to go “light” on restricting Apple’s e-book business. However, the Judge refused to eliminate the need for an outside monitor altogether due to what she termed Apple’s “blatant violation” of federal antitrust laws.
* A trial to determine damages Apple must pay is set for May 2014.
