* Apple on Wednesday began emailing developers regarding the launch of App Store Search Ads. The ads will go live in the App Store on October 5, and for a limited time qualified developers can get a $100 credit toward their first campaign.
* The Search Ads have been in beta testing since the feature was announced in June. Apple describes it as an “efficient and easy way to promote apps at the top of relevant search results,” and promises this won’t negatively affect app searches.
* From today’s email:
* Search Ads was designed to be effortless for small and independent developers. Invest as much or as little time as you have and still get results. We create your ads and match them to relevant searches. You can refine who sees your ad with optional keyword, audience and location features, and you only pay when a customer taps on your ad.  Learn how it works.
* Apple adds that Search Ads was designed to give users a safe search experience, while respecting user privacy. The feature uses App transaction data and contextual information to target users, but it doesn’t share this data, and users can opt out.
