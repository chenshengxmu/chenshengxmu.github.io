* We don’t know much about the next-generation iPhone, which is Apple is expected to introduce later this year. It’s believed to be an ‘S’ model, with a faster processor and other upgraded internals. Outside of that, however, we literally know nothing about the handset.
* But if past ‘S’ iPhone releases are any indication, the iPhone 5S will surely offer at least one ‘stand-out’ feature. The 3GS had video recording, for example, and the 4S added Siri. So what will the 5S’ killer feature be? A new report says it could be slow-motion video…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman points to recently discovered code hidden inside the iOS 7 developer beta that suggests the next-gen iPhone could include a new ‘Mogul’ camera mode. This secret feature, he says, allows video recording at a staggering 120 frames-per-second.
* “We have discovered that Apple is designing a new iPhone camera feature called “Mogul” mode. A mogul is defined as a powerful person in a media industry, making the word a perfect codename (or even a marketing name) for a new iPhone camera feature. The discovery, shared with us by Hamza Sood, comes by way of hidden references inside of the latest iOS 7 betas.
* According to our analysis and testing of the code, “Mogul” is a feature in development that allows the iPhone to capture video at an exceptionally fast and precise rate. Specifically, our testing indicates that the feature can allow the iPhone to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS). The resolution at which this 120FPS video could be recorded at, however, is currently unclear.”
* Capturing video at 120FPS would allow iPhone users to create slow motion films. Many popular cameras and handsets have this feature, including the GoPro Hero3 and Samsung’s Galaxy S4. Video captured at a fast rate, and replayed at standard speed appears much slower.

* Interestingly enough, while testing the mode, Gurman found that Mogul would not work on an iPhone 5 due to ‘unsupported hardware,’ suggesting that it is intended for a future iPhone. Just as Siri was exclusive to the iPhone 4S, Mogul may be reserved for the the 5S.
* Admittedly, slow-motion capture would really round out a nice iPhone 5S feature set, which is rumored to include an all new camera system with a 13MP sensor and dual LED flash. The handset is expected to make its debut this fall, alongside a new budget iPhone model.
* Thoughts?
