* As promised in a report earlier this month, Apple has begun repairing iPhone 5c screens in-store this week. 5c owners with cracked or otherwise damaged displays can now take their handsets into their local Apple stores and have them repaired quickly for a flat fee.
* Apple has been doing this since last year for the iPhone 5, but just recently updated the hardware and training necessary to work with the newer models. The move is the company’s latest effort to cut down on device repair and—perhaps most of all—replacement costs…
* It looks like it’ll cost owners without AppleCare+ $149 to get their screens repaired. That’s about $80 cheaper than the service used to cost non-AppleCare users, and Apple no longer has to send the device off-site. Repairs for those with AppleCare+ are said to cost $75.

* While most Apple stores should now be able to fix iPhone 5 and 5c models in-store, there still seems to be problems with the iPhone 5s. So for the time being, those with broken 5s and 4s units will still have to either have their phones replaced, or sent off-site for repair.
* In May of last year, Apple discussed a number of changes it would be making to its AppleCare service at a staff town hall meeting, including in-store device repairs. Tara Bunch, the vice president of AppleCare, said the changes could result in annual savings of up to $1 billion.
