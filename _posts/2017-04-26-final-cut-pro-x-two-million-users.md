* Apple announced at this week’s annual National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) conference that its Final Cut Pro X video-editing software for Mac has now reached two million users, or “seats“. Five years ago, the Cupertino company launched a major redesign of the app which temporarily killed many advanced features.
* Needless to say, the move irked Apple’s pro users some of whom have since switched to Adobe Premiere and other rival apps. Thankfully, Apple has since added back a lot of the missing features via free updates.
* “It’s a very great pleasure for all of us at Apple today to be able to announce that we’ve now reached two million seats,” Apple’s representative said at the event, adding they’ve been able to get much faster from one million to two million seats than from zero to one million.
* At any rate, it’s encouraging that the pace of adoption has been increasing.
* Apple in years past used the NAB event to announce major new versions of Final Cut Pro. Back in 1998, it even demonstrated an early alpha build of the software to cherry-picked industry figures in a private room at the event.
* Final Cut Pro X is $299.99 on Mac App Store.
* A free 30-day trial can be downloaded from Apple’s website.
* The app requires a Mac with a 64-bit Intel chip, macOS 10.11.4 or later, 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended for 4K editing and 3D titles) and an OpenCL-capable graphics card or Intel HD Graphics 3000 or later.
