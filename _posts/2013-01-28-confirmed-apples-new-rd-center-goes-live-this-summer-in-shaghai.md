* Earlier in the month, the major Chinese web portal Tencent claimed Apple was looking to establish a research and development center in Beijing and last week Cnet China corroborated the story, but noted that the rumored six-story facility with over 100,000 square feet of space is actually going up in Shanghai. Today, a new report from another Chinese news site give us more in way of details…
* BrightWire translated this report by the  Chinese web site Yicai, which is basically an online news section of China Business News, an economic and financial media group based in Shanghai:
* Apple has registered three firms in three buildings in Pudong, Shanghai, and one of them will be dedicated to procurement management and R&D, according to documents on the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce’s website.
* The news is kinda official because Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce has formally announced that Apple will open its R&D center this summer.
* Tim Cook said last week in a conference call with analysts that China, which amounted to nearly one-fifth of Apple’s 2012 revenue , would become its most important market.
* The Cupertino firm is also building an enormous data center in Hong Kong and is working to expand its retail presence in China.
* Apple for at least six years had been planning to build a research and development center in China. The total annual rent for the three buildings is said to exceed CNY 50 million, or about eight million USD.

* The management consulting firm Booz & Co in its Global Innovation 1000 study last year named Apple the most innovative company for the third time in a row, despite spending far less on R&D compared to both Samsung and Microsoft.
* What do you think employees will be researching in the Shanghai R&D center?
* That budget iPhone, perhaps?
