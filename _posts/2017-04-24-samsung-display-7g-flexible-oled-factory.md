* Samsung’s display-making arm is likely to set up a seventh-generation manufacturing plant in South Korea solely dedicated to flexible OLED panel production, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported this morning citing UBI Research. Samsung Display produces more than 90 percent of all OLED panels for smartphones and tablets. The company is expected to churn out OLED panels for iPhone 8 on an exclusive basis until rivals Sharp, LG Display and Japan Display join the mix in 2018 and 2019.
* Samsung already operates 4G, 5.5G and 6G OLED factories.
* The South Korean conglomerate is currently in the process of converting its TFT-LCD manufacturing facility to a 6G flexible OLED plant in anticipation of iPhone 8 orders. The factory is expected to start volume production of OLED panels in the fourth quarter of 2017.
* Apple and Samsung Display reportedly signed a major two-year supply contract for bendable OLED panels for future iPhones, ETNews recently said. Another report suggested that Samsung and its key Korean suppliers could dominate iPhone 8 supply chain for some time.
