* With this morning’s refresh of the twelve-inch MacBook lineup around Intel’s latest processors, Apple’s now discounted refurbished twelve-inch MacBooks, bringing their already reduced price down by up to an additional fifteen percent for most models.
* If you’ve been eyeing Apple’s ultra-thin notebook but have refrained from taking the plunge due to their a bit steep price point—and you don’t mind buying a slightly used, good-as-new products—you can now get an entry-level model of the original twelve-inch MacBook for as low as $929, netting a savings of a cool $370 versus its standard $1,2999 asking price.
* Apple provides free shipping and free return on all refurbished products. Refurbished first-generation MacBooks are factory-tested and certified by Apple, they come with standard one-year warranty and are eligible for extended AppleCare warranty coverage plans.
* The following refurbished models of the twelve-inch notebook are now available:
* All four refurbished MacBook models are available Space Gray, Silver and Gold.
* Again, these are first-generation machines so you’ll get none of the perks of the updated models, like an hour longer battery life, Intel’s faster SkyLake chips with 25 percent faster graphics, speedier flash storage, a new Rose Gold model and more.
* You can shop these products at the refurbished section of the Apple Online Store.
