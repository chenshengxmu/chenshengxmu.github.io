* Following internal crisis caused by the recent breach of user trust, Facebook is considering a version of its service that would be free of advertising provided users would pay to avoid ads.
* Bloomberg said Friday that Facebook has been conducting market research to see if people would pay a monthly or yearly fee to use an ad-free version of the site.
* “The company has studied such an option in the past, but now there’s more internal momentum to pursue it in light of Facebook’s recent privacy data scandal,” sources said.
* From the article:
* Zuckerberg has long considered such an alternative—not to replace the social network’s business model, but to remove a common reason people give for leaving the service. The company generated virtually all its $41 billion in revenue last year by selling ads targeted with user data.
* Internal company research in past years concluded consumers wouldn’t be receptive to a subscription option, seeing it as Facebook being greedy and asking for money for something it said would always be free, sources said.
* that was before the Cambridge Analytica that tarnished the Facebook brand and damaged user trust. Facebook thinks that consumer sentiment may now be changing and has been conducting a broad review of its business to identify ways to regain the trust of users and improve their experience.
* Facebook’s plans are not solid and may not go forward.
* Notably, Facebook’s boss Mark Zuckerberg has not ruled out an ad-free version of the service. He said during the recent congressional hearing that there will always be a version of Facebook that is free. He did not deny the company was looking at a paid option.
* “To be clear, we don’t offer an option today for people to pay to not show ads,” Zuck said, adding that offering people an ad-supported service would be most aligned with its mission of trying to connect everyone in the world.
* “We certainly thought about lots of other forms of monetization including subscriptions, and we’ll always continue to consider everything,” Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during Facebook’s first-quarter earnings call.
