* Like iOS 8, OS X Yosemite introduces third-party extensions. Extensions allow you to easily share with social services and perform other functions.
* Apple has included a new Extensions manager, accessible via System Preferences → Extensions. From there, you can manage built-in extensions, third-party extensions, and Notification Center Today View widgets from one convenient location.
* One of the built-in extensions, the Markup extension, can be used to annotate image attachments within an email on the fly. Like iOS, many of the share extensions can be accessed via the Share button in various apps that feature sharing support. Other extensions, like the Markup extension, will be accessible via dedicated toolbar buttons within the apps that support them.
* Extensions may not be as big of a deal in OS X as they are in iOS 8, but they’re still nice to have. What do you think? Are you excited about the way OS X handles extensions now?
