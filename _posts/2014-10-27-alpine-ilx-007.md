* Alpine, which specializes in car audio and navigation systems, is an Apple-endorsed aftermarket solutions provider for CarPlay. On Monday, the company announced its first aftermarket in-dash receiver designed to work with Apple’s CarPlay, the iLX-007.
* The $800 accessory features a seven-inch capacitive touch screen and supports the full range of CarPlay functionality like making and receiving phone calls and messages, listening to music, navigating with Apple Maps, conversing with Siri and more.
* The receiver is housed inside a three-inch chassis and routes audio, driving directions and phone calls through your vehicle’s speaker system.
* Other features include three (2V) preouts, one aux input, Alpine’s MediaXpander technology for improved playback of compressed media and an input for a rear view camera system (sold separately).
* The free Alpine TuneIt app allows you to adjust a wide range of sound settings on the iLX-007, such as time correction, parametric EQ, crossover points, preset EQ modes and more.
* Features commonly found on other in-dash receivers like an integrated CD/DVD optical media drive or memory card slots are nowhere to be seen on Alpine’s unit.

* The iLX-007 is available for $800 and now shipping to select authorized Alpine retailers. Talk to your local Alpine retailer for availability.
* Key highlights:
* “Apple CarPlay is an incredible experience for drivers,” said Hirofumi Morioka, Alpine’s senior director and CTO. “We are pleased to offer Alpine users a product dedicated to Apple CarPlay, which provides access to the iPhone features they want to use most while driving, such as Maps, Messages, making calls, listening to music and more”.
* CarPlay uses a Lightning connector and is compatible with all iPhones from the iPhone 5 onward with iOS 7.1 or later.
* Pioneer recently issued a firmware update which has enabled CarPlay functionality on half a dozen of its existing in-dash receivers. The company also announced a new $600 smartphone receiver, AppRadio 4, with CarPlay compatibility.
