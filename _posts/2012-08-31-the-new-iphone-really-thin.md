* Thanks to new in-cell display panels, a smaller dock connector and other modifications, the new iPhone is going to be thinner than ever before. How thin? The casing for the handset has been measured at 7.6mm.
* While that doesn’t sound like a very big difference — just 1.7mm thinner than the 9.3mm 4S — it’s certainly noticeable. Just look at these two comparison photos showing the new iPhone, the 4S and the 3GS…

* The two pics above were taken by the folks over at iColorOS and reposted by our friends at Nowhereelse.fr. And they give us an interesting look at Apple’s [purported] new smartphone, compared to its predecessors.
* It’s actually amazing how smartphone technology has progressed over the past three years. Look at how thick the iPhone 3GS looks compared to the other two handsets. I remember when we thought it was thin.
* Perhaps even more impressive is the fact that Apple is rumored to be outfitting this extremely slim device with a bigger battery, larger screen and LTE chips. This in and of itself would be quite the engineering feat.
* But obviously this is all still speculation until Apple actually unveils its new handset. Luckily, the event is now less than two weeks away.
