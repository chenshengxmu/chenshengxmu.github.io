* Following the lead of Electronic Arts, a number of game publishers and developers have heavily discounted their most popular iOS titles for the holidays. They’re hoping to take advantage of all the new iPhones and iPads set to be gifted in the next week.
* Disney and Warner Bros. are among those participating in the big sale, as are Square Enix, Activision and many others. And many popular games like Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour, Deus Ex: The Fall and Infinity Blade III have been heavily discounted…
* Below is just a small sample of the games that are on sale right now. Chances are if you see a title from a larger publisher or developer, most, if not all, of their catalog has been discounted. So if you don’t find something here you want, it’s worth looking around.
* The prices range from $0.99 to $4.99, with some games being discounted as much as $8 or $9. There’s no word yet on how long any of these deals are going to last, but given that this is a holiday sale, we imagine they’ll last at least through next Wednesday.
* Did we miss something big? Let us know in the comments below!
