* I’m still tweaking my new iMac so it behaves the way I want it to. While all my main apps have been installed and set up as needed, there is still all these little things that need to be finetuned. One of those things is file extensions.
* By default, macOS hides the extensions of filenames. I imagine this is made to simplify the view for casual users, and I’m totally fine with that. However, I like to see the extensions of files on my desktop or in Finder, which allows me to use files differently depending on their extensions.
* In this post, I will show you how to hide or show the extensions of filenames on a Mac in macOS.
* Step 1: Open a new Finder window on your Mac.
* Step 2: In the Menu bar, go to Finder > Preferences.

* Step 4: Select the box that says “Show all filename extensions”. If you want to hide file extensions, just uncheck the box.
* It’s as simple and quick as that. If like me you like to show filename extensions, then follow these easy steps.
