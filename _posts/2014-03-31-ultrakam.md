* As you know, the iPhone 5s’s iSight camera can shoot full HD 1080p video (1,920-by-1,080 pixels) at 30 frames per second, as well as slow-motion clips at 120 frames per second at a reduced resolution of 1,280-by-720 pixels (720p). The back shooter can also take eight-megapixel stills at the image capture size of 3,264-by-2,448 pixels.
* But what if the handset could take a series of stills in a rapid succession and stitch them together to form an ultra-resolution footage?
* That’s what Ultrakam, a novel iPhone application by Hassan Uriostegui, does for you. Available in the App Store for $6.99 for a limited time, the software brings 2K film resolution to your iPhone 5s at 30 and 20 frames per second.
* It also includes a handy film-like 24 frames per second preset and can automatically smooth rack-focus during recording. Read on for the full reveal…
* As noted by The Next Web, Ultrakam shoots 2,240-by-1,672 pixel video, which is around 75 percent more pixels than the regular full HD resolution of 1,920-by-1,080 pixels. Taking 2K images at 24 frames per second and encoding them into a Motion JPEG format in real-time requires a lot of horse power so Ultrakam works best with A7 devices like the iPhone 5s and iPad Air.
* Here’s a quick video walkthrough.
* The app also supports previous-generation devices such as the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPad mini, though you’ll have to settle with 2K video capture at 20 frames per second on these gadgets.

* Ultrakam is anything but your ordinary camera app: your 2L clips get stored as either Motion JPEG or H.264 iFrame encoded files. Motion JPEG is a video format specifically created to compress each frame separately as a JPEG image, which quickly increases file size.
* Specifically, a minute of 2K Motion JPEG footage at 24 frames per second will consume up to three gigabytes of storage space so the top-of-the-line iPhone 5s with 64 gigabytes per storage will fill up after mere 20 minutes of 2K video capture.

* Ultrakam also shoots slow motion footage at 120 frames per second on the iPhone 5s, or 60 frames per second on the previous-generation iPhone 5/5c.

* Advanced video capture settings let you choose your bit-rate for video and audio, with the built-in player offering a variety of editing tools that allow you to share your videos and stills, apply color correction, set while balance and focus/exposure values independently, generate stills from a video and more.
* Note that setting lower-quality presets will let you slow down your recordings by up to ten times. Playing back 2K footage directly on the device comes with a caveat. “As with high end cameras, 2K recordings are tough to playback, so you may need to use the ‘Render Proxy’ function in the player to create a more playable version,” the developer notes.
* Of course, it makes no sense to render a 2,240-by-1,672 pixel video on the iPhone’s 1,136-by-640 pixel Retina screen so you’ll want to use iTunes file sharing to copy the clips over to your desktop and edit them using a pro video editing software such as Apple’s Final Cut Pro X.

* It’s also nice that Ultrakam includes remote control on another device, using Bluetooth 4.0 and a separate Ultracam Remote Control app for $2.99.
* Learn more about the app at the official Ultrakam website.
* Grab Ultrakam in the App Store for $6.99, a 60 percent discount for a limited time.
* The app is universal and iOS 7.0 or later is required.
