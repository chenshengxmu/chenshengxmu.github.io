* Need to jot down a quick phone number, recipe, directions, or an address? If you have an iPhone 4S, you could always rely on Siri, but what if you don’t?
* A simple solution would be QuickMemo — a Notification Center widget for jailbroken iOS 5 devices, which allows you to jot down notes with a simple swipe of the status bar.
* It’s not perfect, but QuickMemo is more than adequate to function as a scratch pad. Take a look inside for a video walkthrough that shows the widget in action…
* While it’s great for jotting down quick notes, it does have one major caveat: If you disable the widget, and later reenable, all of your notes are deleted.
* If you’re not one who fools around with the Notification settings much, then you shouldn’t run into this problem, but it’s something to be aware of.
* QuickMemo is a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. What do you think about it?
