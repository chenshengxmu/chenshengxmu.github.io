* Best Buy has begun offering Apple’s newly-released iPhone 5c at a bit of a discount this weekend, trimming $50 off the handset’s price tag—which starts at $99 with a two-year contract.
* The offer features a $50 Best Buy gift card, which you will get at the time of purchase of any iPhone 5c. That goes for any carrier the retailer does business with, and any configuration…
* After the discount, customers will essentially end up paying $50 for the 16GB iPhone 5c, which is normally $99 on contract, and just $99 for the 32GB model, which typically goes for $199.

* Unfortunately, it looks like the gift card is only good on future purchases, so the discount won’t be instant. Also, it appears the promotion only works for in-store or store-pickup orders.
* Nevertheless, it’s a decent sale for those looking to score the iPhone 5c on the cheap. So if you’re interested, make sure you hit up your local Best Buy this weekend. The deal ends Sunday.
