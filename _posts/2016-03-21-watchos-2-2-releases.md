* In addition to the major iOS 9.3 software update for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, a companion software update for the Apple Watch released this morning, too. The new watchOS 2.2 firmware is now available as an over-the-air download in the companion Watch app for the iPhone.
* watchOS 2.2 is not as major a release as iOS 9.3 or OS X 10.11.4 so ti includes only a few improvements such as the Nearby feature in Apple’s Maps app, the ability to pair multiple watches to a single iPhone and more.
* Before we get to it, check out a brief video walkthrough of all the new features watchOS 2.2 has to offer by our own Andrew O’Hara.
* watchOS 2.2 it is the first software release for the Apple Watch that lets you pair multiple watches to a single iPhone simultaneously. This feature should be of particular interest to people who own more than one watch and want to use one, say, for jogging and working out and the other for a more dressy occasion.
* Folks who write software for a living and wish to test their native apps on multiple watches should find this new feature quite handy, too.

* The companion Watch app is even smart enough to automatically switch over to the right watch without you having to do anything other than putting your watch on and raising your wrist.
* Multiple watches can only be paired to an iPhone running iOS 9.3 or later.
* The stock Maps app has been revamped and received some updates in watchOS 2.2.
* For starters, Search is now a tappable option rather than requiring a Force Touch action and there’s a new toggle for switching between standard and transit directions.
* More importantly, Maps in watchOS 2.2 brings out the Nearby feature which lets you browse various points of interest in your vicinity and find local business organized by type, powered by Yelp’s database.
