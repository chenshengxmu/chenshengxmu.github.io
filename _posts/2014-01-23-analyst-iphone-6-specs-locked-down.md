* Apple has apparently decided on the design of its next iPhone and specifications are said to include a 4.8-inch display, according to an analyst with Cowen and Company who must have been following our non-scientific poll which had the majority of respondents opt for a 4.7-inch form factor.
* The phone should additionally include the latest 802.11ac networking, also known as Gigabit Wi-Fi, for three times greater wireless transfer speeds. Apple currently supports Gigabit Wi-Fi in the recently refreshed AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule wireless appliances and across its Mac Pro, MacBook and iMac families…
* Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company (via AppleInsider) wrote in yesterday’s note to clients that Apple has internally “locked down” the iPhone 6 design with Gigabit Wi-Fi and a 4.8-inch screen. Samsung’s Galaxy S4 and HTC’s One both support 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking. He does not expect the phone to exceed five inches due to Apple’s “unwavering principle of one hand use.”
* That Apple only now locked down the design suggests it’s still months away from bringing a larger-screened iPhone to market. Given Tim Cook’s annual refresh cycle, the iPhone 6 should get introduced in Fall, in line with past three iPhone generations.
* Acuri acknowledged as much, estimating that Apple will launch the iPhone 6 in September 2014. He’s also expecting some “key software innovations” such as a long-rumored mobile payment solution from Apple leveraging the existing iBeacons, Touch ID and Passbook technologies.
* Aside from hardware tweaks and design changes, Arcuri also said that Apple is planning “key software innovations” with the next major release of its iOS platform.
* He expects the company will leverage iBeacon, Touch ID and Passbook as part of a push into new services with mobile payments.
* This sounds very compelling.
* With the iPhone 5s and iOS 6 and 7, Apple has cleverly laid groundwork for mobile payments with Touch ID, Passbook and iBeacons. These technologies could allow Apple to integrate loyalty programs and digital coupons with a secure payment system.
* A user’s payment information could be securely stored on the Secure Enclave module as it’s physically isolated from other components. Currently, Secure Enclave stores non-identifable fingerprint data of an iPhone 5s user.

* Touch ID could be used to authenticate payments and iTunes billing could take care of actually charging your credit card on file.
* How all of this might come together is up for the debate, but one thing’s certain: if Apple chooses to enter mobile payments with a solution of its own, it’s going to be seamless – as in, it’ll “just work”.
* Are you excited about the next iPhone replacing your wallet?
