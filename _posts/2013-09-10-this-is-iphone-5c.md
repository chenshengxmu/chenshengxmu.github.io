* Apple’s executives are on-stage at the company’s Town Hall campus in the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters. Head honcho Tim Cook kicked off the long-expected keynote at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern with his usual barrage of Apple biz stats (they don’t call him a numbers guy for nothing).
* And now, the company has officially taken the wraps off a product critics said would never see the light of  day: a more affordable iPhone. They are calling it the iPhone 5c and it’s basically the existing 2012 iPhone 5 hardware redesigned around a polycarbonate plastic enclosure with a black front face and your choice  of one of the five brightly colored backplates: red, blue, yellow, green and white.
* We have the full breakdown for you guys right after the jump…
* “In the past, we’ve lowered the price of the iPhone, making it accessible to more people,” Tim Cook teased before unveiling the web’s worst-kept secret, the iPhone 5C name.
* “We’re not doing that this year,” he added.

* The device borrows much of the internals from the current-generation iPhone 5, including the A6 chip, the eight-megapixel iSight camera on the back. However, it has a slightly bigger battery. Oh, there’s also a four-inch Retina display with the same 1,136-by-640 pixel resolution like the iPhone 5.
* The phone supports “more LTE bands than any other smartphone in the world,” marketing head Phil Schiller boasted.
* Apple is also getting back in the case game: they are offering custom cases for the iPhone 5c made of soft-feel silicon rubber (yes, there’s space around the handset’s camera and flash).

* You “won’t see seams, or part lines, or joins,” Schiller noted.
* Again, the iPhone 5c is made from hard-coated polycarbonate plastic.

* The 16/32GB will set you back $99/$199 with a two-year contract.
* Summing up, the rumor-mill appears to have nailed every aspect of the iPhone 5c, up to the point where Tim Cook & Co. had little to no surprises left up their sleeve.
* So, what’s your first impression of the iPhone 5c?
