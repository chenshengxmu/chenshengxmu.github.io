* It looks like Apple has turned to LG’s Innotek division as a source of dual-camera modules for its upcoming iPhone 7 refresh. Industry sources told Business Korea that “LG Innotek will exclusively supply dual camera module to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which will come out in September this year”.
* LG Innotek will reportedly begin the shipment of the dual camera module as early as this month though its reportedly exclusive deal might actually be short-lived because “there can be other vendors next year”.
* Sony was previously mentioned as a potential dual-camera module supplier, but it said it would pull out of the high-end camera module business through its forecast report in May.
* According to the rumor-mill, only the flagship 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model is expected to rock dual cameras while its 4.7-inch counterpart is expected to use a single-camera module.
