* It’s been months since PayPal issued any significant update to its iPhone client. Today, the company took to the official blog to announce a brand new version of PayPal for iPhone, a major step up compared to the previous basic version.
* In addition to the revamped interface, the refreshed software features front and center a new Shop section which makes it easy to find shops or restaurants nearby that accept PayPal payments. That’s just scratching the surface: the new build finally lets you check out at your local stores, pay at table, order ahead and even browse for local offers.
* As a bonus, the application now makes it possible to switch payment methods on the go to make sure you get reward points from a particular card. Another useful capability: the popular Bill Me Later payment option has been added. I’ve included additional information and PayPal’s promotional video past the fold…
* The update was significant enough to warrant a blog post and a promo clip.

* I particularly love the ability to skip the line by ordering ahead at participating merchants (picture right below). Simply check in on the PayPal app to order ahead today at more than a thousand Eat24 locations.
* More restaurants and cafes will be “coming soon,” PayPal said.
* According to TechCrunch, PayPal was testing this feature at McDonald’s in France and earlier this year at select US Jamba Juice locations.

* The Pay at Table option (below) allows customers to check-in to view their bill, give a tip and pay their restaurant bill – all through the PayPal app. “You can even order another drink from the app at some locations,” PayPal underscored.

* Another tremendously useful improvement – the ability to change payment methods on the go – make it dead simple to, say, pay using your bank account in one store and your credit card at the next place.
* And if you don’t have credit cards, don’t worry – this version lets you open a line of credit in-app using the proprietary payment method called Bill Me Later. In partnership with PayPal, Bill Me Later currently offers six months to pay on purchases of $99 or more from participating PayPal retailers.
* As for local offers, just waltz inside a store and an offer – if available – will be waiting in-app. Offers saved to your PayPal wallet automatically redeem at checkout. “Starting today, $100 in offers is available in your PayPal app from local US businesses,” the company announced.
* Grab the free update from the App Store.
