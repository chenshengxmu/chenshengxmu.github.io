* If you’ve pre-ordered an iPhone XS Max, or are planning to pick one up at some point, you’re going to want to strongly consider picking up a case. I don’t care how good the phone looks without one, you’re talking about a $1,100+ gadget that is completely covered in glass. The good news is, there are plenty of case options available for Apple’s new 6.5-inch handset, and we’ve done the hard work so you don’t have to. Below is our roundup of the best iPhone XS Max cases, with options for just about everyone’s taste, lifestyle and budget.
* Note: some of the iPhone XS Max cases in our roundup ship sooner than others, so pay attention to the ship date if you pre-ordered an iPhone XS Max, or plan to have one on launch day, and need a case right away.

* I’ve always loved Speck cases for their minimalist design, premium-feeling materials and protection, and this year’s Presidio is no exception. It’s on the expensive side of our list, but I think the old adage “you get what you pay for” rings true here.
* Buy for $45

* Totallee makes some of the thinnest cases on the market with zero visible branding, so of course their Clear Thin case made the list. It’s not going to provide anywhere near the protection as the thicker cases, but it will keep stray scratches away.
* Buy for $20

* This long-running, rugged OtterBox case line features a two-layer design with a hard shell exterior and soft interior, covers to keep debris out of ports and buttons, and a built-in belt clip that doubles as a kickstand. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty.
* Buy for $60

* The Ultra Hybrid case from Spigen is a nice blend of thinness and protection. It has Military-grade Air Cushion technology for protection against drops and scrapes, and I really like the design contrast between the dark bumper and transparent backing.
* Buy for $13

* Catalyst is another case-maker known for their durability and their Impact Protection Case for the iPhone XS Max looks great. Features include military-grade drop protection, covers for ports, and a raised bezel to help protect the screen during a fall.
* Buy for $50

* Of course no case roundup would be complete without a wallet offering, and right now I’m really liking Nomad’s Rugged Folio for the XS Max. It’s wrapped in soft Horween leather and features 3 card slots, 1 cash slot and protects from drops of up to 6 feet.
* Buy for $60
* And that should just about cover it! Obviously this is just a few of the iPhone XS Max cases out there, and we plan to add others to this list as we get more review units in and more become available for order. And as always, if you know of a case that isn’t on this list and deserves to be, let us know in the comments below and we’ll check it out!
