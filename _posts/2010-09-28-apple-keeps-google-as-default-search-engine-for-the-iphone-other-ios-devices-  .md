* The most annoying commercials I see in the very little TV I watch in a week have to be the Bing commercials. They give me a headache. That being said. I won’t have to worry about Microsoft’s search engine replacing Google as the default topic finder.
* Mac Rumors reports that Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Charlie Rose that the company recently extended their initial deal with Apple as the default search engine for all iOS devices. There were rumors that the iPhone and others might jump, leaving Bing to be the front runner. Apple recently allowed iOS users the ability to use Bing as a search engine, though users have to opt-in to participate…
* The actual quote from the Google CEO reads as follows:
* Apple (AAPL) is a company we both partner and compete with. We do a search deal with them, recently extended, and we’re doing all sorts of things in maps and things like that.
* Definitely generic, I’ll give you that. I wonder how much cash Google has to fork over to Cupertino to maintain the search rights to the millions of iOS devices. In the end I’m glad since I have used Bing for next to nothing.
* Are you a Google searcher or have you taken a liking to Bing? Would you like to see it replaced on iOS devices as the default search engine? Give us your search inspired comments in the box below.
