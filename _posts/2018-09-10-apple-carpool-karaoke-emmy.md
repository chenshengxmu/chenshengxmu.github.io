* Apple’s video streaming plans, which include tons of original productions as well as some licensed content, have received an important industry recognition when the firm’s “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” won a Primetime Emmy award on Sunday night.
* Deadline reported that the show won in the category of “Outstanding Short Form Variety Series” at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. As noted by AppleInsider, this makes the show, based on the popular recurring segment from “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” Apple’s first TV production to receive the prestigious accolade for its content.
* “To try and do a ‘Carpool Karaoke’ series without James Corden was a tricky thing,” executive producer Ben Winston said on stage while accepting the award.
* Tonight we won an Emmy for our Apple @CarpoolKaraoke series. So over the moon for everyone on the team especially Eric Pankowski. Huge thanks to @cue and Jimmy Iovine with Robert Kondrk who had vision for what this show could be and are the most amazing partners ?? pic.twitter.com/0YdpeszH1x

* “They were incredibly supportive and it’s a sign of the times that TV isn’t what it used to be,” co-executive producer Eric Pankowski told The Hollywood reporter of working with Apple. “They let us do our show and play in this sandbox. We are really excited to be here and do them proud.”
* “Carpool Karaoke” is about celebrity pairings. In each episode, different celebrities share a car and sing along to their playlists. The show is only available to paid Apple Music subscribers.
* ROUNDUP: Apple’s original TV shows and series
* The first season of “Carpool Karaoke” was briefly available in the TV app free of charge. The 19-episode season concluded last year, but Apple renewed the show for a second season.
