* Five days and over 145,000 signatures later, Apple finally pulled the Exodus International app from the App Store. As harmless as it looked on the surface, the app dubbed as “Gay Cure” was terribly offensive, especially to the gay community.
* A representative for Exodus International says “Our mission is to reach those with unwanted same-sex attractions and help them to reconcile their sexuality with their faith”… 
* I don’t think sexual orientations have anything to do with faith but that’s another debate, and iDB is definitely not the place for it.
* It took Apple a while to pull this app from the App Store, but I’m glad they did.
