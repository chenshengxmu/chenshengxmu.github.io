* With every new iPhone coming out, older models see a price drop, allowing those of us who don’t have $200 to spend on a phone access to some of the best smartphones out there at a reasonable price.
* Following the launch of the iPhone 4S, Apple dropped the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. For that price, you only get an 8GB version of the device, but it’s still a good deal. If $99 is still too much, you can get the older iPhone 3GS for free. Yes, for free, but with a 2-year contract…
* This is a great deal you can’t pass on, unless you’re buying the iPhone 4S, of course.
