* If you are a contractor, a freelancer, or want to keep track of your time for personal reasons, there are plenty of apps that can help you do it. But, how do you choose which to use?
* Here are four of the best time tracking apps for iPhone along with their notable features.

* Timelines gives you the convenience of one-tap time tracking with the flexibility of multiple projects and tasks all in one.
* You can track any activity by simply giving it a name. But, you also have options to add a color marker, size of the task, notes, and a main timeline (category). For those who need a time tracker for work, this is an ideal way to track multiple tasks for different projects.
* You can set up several timelines and view them all on the main timeline screen or see one at a time. For instance, you may have a timeline for each freelance job you do. This allows you to create and track tasks for each one or simply use the one-tap timer.
* Not used to using a time tracker and worried you’ll forget? This is no problem because Timelines offers reminders to start and stop timers. Whether you need a reminder when you start work each day or one after a certain amount of time passes, you got it.
* Timelines includes a host of additional features such as statistics, file export, subcategories, archiving, project filters, and more. This is not a free app and there is no try-before-you-buy option. But, if you want an all-inclusive time tracker and are willing to spend a bit, Timelines is a solid and excellent app.

* HoursTracker: Hours and Pay is another great time tracker that is perfect for those who want to track their pay at the same time.
* You can set up multiple jobs and have flexible ways to track your time for each. For example, you can add a job and tap to clock in (start the timer), pause it to take a break, and then clock out. Alternatively, you can start and stop the clock at designated times. So, HoursTracker is handy for both freelancers and shift workers.
* When you create a job, you have many options for both times and pay. You can include hourly and overtime rates, tags, a location, reminders to clock out, automatic breaks, and pay period details that even include deductions. This makes both time and pay tracking super easy.
* To view your entries, you can see those for days, weeks, months, or jobs. You can also create filters and use the search feature. Check out your pay periods and how much you earned per job or by date. You can also export your data, back it up to the cloud (with a free account) and set a passcode.
* If you are looking for a free app, with upgrade options, that offers easy time and pay tracking, then check out HoursTracker: Hours and Pay.

* Hours Time Tracking is similar to Timelines in that you can set up multiple projects and view how your time is spent easily on the main timeline screen.
* To start, just create your projects. Choose a name for each one, pick a color, and add or select a client. The app offers simple one-tap timers for all projects on one screen. So, you can start a timer for one project, tap to stop it, and start another all in one place. This makes your time tracking for tasks quick and painless.
* The easy-to-read timeline is conveniently displayed at the top of your projects screen. Tap a color on the timeline to view details for that project. You can also add notes, split the time, or add a break. If you want to go back in time, tap the calendar icon and then select any date to see the time spent on projects for that day.
* Hours Time Tracking gives you reports, reminders, sounds, time and date format options, and connects to Freshbooks. You can use the app as-is or sign up for a free account and receive syncing, backups, and web tracking. For another neat and clean time tracking app, this one is excellent.

* If you want to track time spent at work, at play, or even at the gym, take a look at ATracker. This app gives you cool categories built right in.
* ATracker starts you off with projects for gaming, gym, and housework so you can begin tracking those types of activities by just tapping one on the screen. But, adding your own projects and tasks for work or school is easy.
* To begin, just add a category, give it a name and color, and decide if you want it on the pie chart for quick views. Then when you add a task, pick your category and plug in all the details. Give it a name, icon, color, and description. Create alerts, a countdown, and a task duration if you like.
* You can start and stop a timer for any project with one tap on the main projects screen. Then to see where you spend your time, view the report with either a bar or pie chart and look at the current day, week, month, or pick a range (pie chart view). You can also view your history with the calendar display.
* ATracker offers different skins and settings for notifications, date format, simultaneous tasks, and more. So, when you are exploring options for your time tracking, take a look at ATracker and see if it’s a good fit for you.
* Hopefully one of these four time tracking apps for iPhone is just what you’ve been looking for. They each bring something a little different to suit various needs. Do you already use one of these or do you have one that you prefer and would recommend? Let us know!
