* Earlier today, a report came in regarding the date as to when Apple would hold its annual fall media event. Japanese site Kodawarisan claimed that Apple will be holding the media event as soon as September 7th.
* While Apple has announced next generation iPods in September for the past three years, a new report has completely debunked the rumor of an Apple event on September 7th…
* According to Jim Dalrymple of The Loop, sources claim no such media event will take place on that date.
* “Reports began to surface yesterday that Apple would hold a special event on September 7 to launch the new iPhone, but that’s not happening.
* According to my sources, Apple will not have an event or launch the next iPhone on September 7. It’s hard to say how that specific date was chosen by the sites that started the rumor, other than it fits into the timeline of previous Apple events.”
* Jim has had a good track record in the past with Apple rumors. He correctly predicted that Apple wouldn’t announce the iPhone at WWDC this Summer.
* At this point in time, most rumors have been pointing towards a September or October release, but we’ll just have to wait and see!
