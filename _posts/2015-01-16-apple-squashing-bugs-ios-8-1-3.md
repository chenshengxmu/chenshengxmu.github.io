* Apple is still hard at work on iOS 8.1.3, issuing a second beta (build 12B466) to retail employees in its testing group yesterday. The firmware was expected to be released to the public this week, but according to a report from MacRumors, engineers are still trying to iron out bugs.
* The site notes that it continues to see a steady uptick of visits from devices running iOS 8.1.3, and iDB can confirm we’re seeing similar patterns in our own analytics (above). This again suggests that a public release is imminent, but whether it’ll be this week or next we don’t know.
* Firmware 8.1.3 is not believed to include any major new features, but instead bring about various under-the-hood bug fixes. This shouldn’t surprise anyone, given how many unresolved issues we’ve seen in iOS 8 thus far, and the current consensus regarding Apple software.
* Beyond 8.1.3, we’re also anticipating iOS 8.2 to be released publicly within the next few months. This larger update, which has already seen four developer betas, is believed to include new features such as support for Apple Watch and its built-in Companion app.
* As always, we’ll let you know as soon as iOS 8.1.3 or any other important updates become available.
