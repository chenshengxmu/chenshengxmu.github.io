* Hot on the heels of this morning’s update from Pandora comes a new version of the Rdio app for iOS. The update brings the music client to version 2.2, and includes a number of new features and improvements.
* Perhaps the biggest change in today’s release is the addition of “Find People,” a new tool that will make it easier for users to find friends and discover artists to follow. And the UI improvements are also blatant…
* Here’s your full 2.2 change log:
* – Find People. New feature makes following friends and artists easier than ever. – Labels. Search for a record label to find its top albums and artists. – Various minor bug fixes and UI improvements, including new, cleaner look for sliding side navigation.
* The new ‘Find People’ feature is actually pretty cool, as it makes it easier to find other Rdio users to follow. Following users helps you discover new music by seeing others’ digital collections, playlists and reviews.
* I also like the new look of the side navigation menu. It now features a gradient background and flat text, bringing the menu in line with the rest of the app. Rdio has been iteratively revamping the client since last fall.
* If you’re interested in checking out the new Rdio app, you can find it in the App Store for free. But as usual, you’ll need an account to use the app, which will run you $4.99/month for desktop use and $9.99 for mobile.
