* Two is always better than one, right? Well, in the case of PasswordPilot and StayOpened, two is indeed, most definitely better than one.
* StayOpened is the Robin to PasswordPilot’s Batman. Their mission? To make App Store purchases easier!
* Inside, I’ll show you why you should consider this Lebron James + Dwyane Wade type of combo to conquer what ails you about the App Store…
* For frequent App Store shoppers with a jailbroken iPhone, this combination of tweaks is a no-brainer. No longer do I have to dread retyping my password over and over. No longer will the App Store prematurely close before I’m finished shopping.
* This is the first of many jailbreak tweak dynamic duos. Do you have any you’d like to share?
