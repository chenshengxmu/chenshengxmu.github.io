* An AT&T customer care representative has claimed that Apple has informed the carrier that there will be no new iPhone in June or July of this year. Although general consensus has been that Apple will postpone the next generation iPhone until later this year, there has still been hope that a summer announcement at WWDC would be made.
* According to an AT&T rep, Apple will definitely not be releasing a new iPhone this summer.
* MacRumors,
* “The disclosure came after the reader noticed that his eligibility date for a subsidized upgrade had been pushed back by over five months and contacted AT&T to inquire about the reason for the change.”
* When asked about eligibility for a subsidized upgrade, an unidentified AT&T rep answered:
* “Apple has informed us that they do not plan to release the iPhone in the June to July timeframe, though there will be a newer version in the future. Unfortunately, we have not been given a release time for the new phone. We will release this information on our website when it is available to us.”
* It seems unlikely that a call center representative would be aware of such top-level information, so take this news with a grain of salt. Call center reps don’t usually have access to this type of internal info.
* However, this statement does help confirm the string of other reports that claim a fall release for the next iPhone.
* Don’t forget, this past weekend we broke the story that Apple is working on two new iPhone models. This news was based off our source at an Apple parts supplier.
* If you needed anymore confirmation that there won’t be a new iPhone(s) this summer, you have it now. Apple recently released the white iPhone 4, and that product is expected to help maintain sales for Apple until a new device is announced in Q2 of this year.
* Why do you think Apple has postponed the next generation iPhone?
