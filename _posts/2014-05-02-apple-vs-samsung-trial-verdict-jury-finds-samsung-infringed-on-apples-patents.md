* The verdict has just been given in the second trial opposing Apple to Samsung, which has taken place in California over the last month.
* After hearing 50 hours of testimonies and deliberating for three days, the jury has finally come to an agreement and found that Samsung has infringed on three Apple patents, while Apple infringed on one Samsung patent…
* Apple filed the lawsuit in February 2012, asserting Samsung’s violated five Apple patents with its Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II, Galaxy SII, Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch, Galaxy S II Skyrocket, Galaxy S III, Galaxy Tab II 10.1, and other devices. Samsung responded with a counterclaim, stating two Samsung patents were infringed on within the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini, iPod touch (5th generation), iPod touch (4th generation), and MacBook Pro.
* The jury found that:
* The jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $119,625,000 in damages, which is far from the $2.2 billion Apple was asking for Samsung infringing on its patent. Samsung was claiming it only owed no more than $38M.
* The jury also found that Apple infringed on one Samsung patent related to the way FaceTime handles video streaming, awarding the Korean company $158,400 in damages from Apple.
* Of course, $119M is pocket change for Apple, but was it ever about money? Probably not. Although these are mixed results, Apple did make a point that Samsung was indeed infringing on some of its patents. This point is likely not as big as Apple would have wanted, making it more of a symbolic win for Apple than a proper victory.
* In a statement to Recode, Apple said:
* We are grateful to the jury and the court for their service. Today’s ruling reinforces what courts around the world have already found: that Samsung willfully stole our ideas and copied our products. We are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products like the iPhone, which our employees devote their lives to designing and delivering for our customers.
* Even though Samsung must pay Apple almost $120M in damages, you can’t help but think the lawyers for the company are still taking this as a victory, considering the first trial didn’t end up so well for the Korean giant.
* Update: While examining the jury’s decision, Apple found it was not awarded damages for the Galaxy SII, which was found infringing on one patent. The jury decided to come back on Monday to sort out damages Apple should be awarded for this.
