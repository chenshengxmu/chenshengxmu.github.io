* Apple has seeded the second beta of OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite this evening. The update, labeled build 14B23, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Mac Dev Center for all registered developers.
* Today’s release comes just one week after the first beta, and nearly a month after 10.10 went public. It’s not clear what changes it includes yet, but Apple has asked devs to focus on Wi-Fi, Mail and Notification center.
* We didn’t see any major changes in the first beta of OS X 10.10.1, and given how close the build numbers are, we aren’t expecting any in today’s release. It’s likely Apple is focusing on bug fixes and other improvements.
* Nevertheless, we’re currently installing the beta and will update this post if we find any significant changes or additions. If you come across something not mentioned here, feel free to e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
