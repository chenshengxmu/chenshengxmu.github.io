* Apple on Wednesday said that it is aware of the calendar spam issue and is working to fix it. In a statement to iMore’s Rene Ritchie, a spokesperson for the company apologized for the spam calendar invites and said it’s actively working to address the issue.
* We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.
* The response follows a recent uptick in calendar-related spam. Essentially, spammers send out mass event invites to users with links to fake apparel shops and other nefarious websites, and right now there’s no way to opt-out or filter out these faux invitations.
* The good news is, it sounds like Apple is on top of things and can hopefully squash the issue before it gets too out of hand. For those that feel like the problem is already out of hand, be sure to check out our tutorial on what you can do to stop the spam yourself.
