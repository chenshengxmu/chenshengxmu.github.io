* Parallels Desktop for Mac 14 has been unveiled. The popular cross-platform solution that lets you run Windows 10 on your Mac features support for Apple’s upcoming macOS Mojave update and includes storage and performance enhancements, and more. 
* The primary focus of this year’s Parallels Desktop for Mac release is on enhanced storage optimization. This year’s version is between 20 percent and 30 percent smaller than earlier releases. This will allow you to save as much as 20GB of disk space.
* Performance improvements, meanwhile, include:
* Also, for the first time, Apple TouchBar support has arrived for the following popular Windows apps: Microsoft Visio and OneNote, SketchUp, AutoCAD, Revit, Quicken, QuickBooks and Visual Studio. They join other apps that picked up TouchBar support in previous years including Office 2016 (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook), Windows Start Menu and desktop (Cortana, Task View and Task Bar pinned elements), File Explorer (File Open and Save As settings), and web browsers (Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Vivaldi).
