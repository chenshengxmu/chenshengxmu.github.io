* It’s a wonderful time to be jailbroken, especially if you’re on iOS 11. Jailbreak tweak developers are coming up with fun and quirky ways to modify your device on a daily basis, and there has been a noticeable spike in activity from the community since the launch of Electra1131.
* This roundup encompasses all the jailbreak tweaks launched in Cydia from August 20th until August 26th. As usual, we’ll kick things off by talking about our favorites, and then wrap things up with an outline of the rest afterward.

* Adagio is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you summon an interface on the left side of your display with all your recently-used apps. Upon opening the interface, you can easily launch any of your recently-used apps with a tap.
* The tweak provides options to configure for those who don’t like the way it behaves out of the box, but to learn more about that, you’ll need to visit our full review.

* The stock voicemail system in iOS sucks, but AnsweringMachine X fixes this by upgrading your voicemail experience to something you’d expect to use in the 21st century.
* Not only does AnsweringMachine X store your voicemail locally, but it provides a number of other useful features that any smartphone voicemail system should have, such as real-time listening, voice transcription, advanced remote commands, and much more.
