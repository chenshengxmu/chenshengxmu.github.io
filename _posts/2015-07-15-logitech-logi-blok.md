* Accessory maker Logitech on Wednesday introduced the world to its all-new family of protective case, shell and keyboard cases for Apple’s iPad. Called Logi BLOK, the latest accessories offer protection from drops up to six feet high and onto surfaces as hard as concrete. The lineup is comprised of the Logi BLOK Protective Shell, the Logi BLOK Protective Case and the Logi BLOK Protective Keyboard Case.
* After announcing a new branding strategy earlier this month, today marks first Logitech products to have been released under the new Logi brand. All three accessories will be available for purchase in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and across select European markets in August.
* “The iPad is a powerful device. But people have dropped and damaged – or are afraid that they will drop and damage – the iPad, so they typically don’t use it to its full potential,” said Michele Hermann, vice president of mobility at Logitech.
* The video below offers an insight into the design of the cases’ square corners which provide protection without adding unnecessary bulk or weight to your iPad.
* As you can see for yourself, these new cases feature absorbent polymer structure which Logitech claims flexes with your iPad upon impact. The square corners sport extra-absorbent polymers for added protection.
* Here’s a closer look at Logitech’s new lineup.
* Designed for the latest iPad Air 2 and all models of iPad mini, the sleek BLOK Protective Shell integrates a screen protector with perimeter protection for an uninterrupted iPad experience while helping guard your tablet’s screen from scratches.
* “The shell has a simple and sleek design that is ultra-protective, yet maintains the integrity of the iPad to make it feel as though you’re holding the iPad without a case,” Logitech notes.
* This case is available in black, red/violet or teal/blue for $39.99.
* This case integrates a stand which holds your iPad at any angle within a 50-degree range so you can enjoy your media, edit documents and photos and more, all hands-free. When closed, the screen cover helps protect your iPad screen from direct impact.
* Designed for the iPad Air 2, the $69.99 case is available in black, red/violet or teal/blue.
* Available for the iPad Air 2, this versatile case offers drop protection for your tablet and has a kickstand for hands-free viewing. The integrated Bluetooth keyboard which doubles as a screen cover can be easily attached or detached and has a dedicated row of iOS shortcut keys.
* It’s available in black or teal/blue for $129.99.
* As mentioned before, the new accessories are all expected to be available in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and select countries in Europe beginning in August 2015.
