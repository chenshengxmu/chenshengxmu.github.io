* A report from China claims Apple is facing a battery challenge in the development of the next iPhone. It’s unclear whether this affects the planned October release, but apparently one of Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers is having issues meeting requirements for the iPhone 5 battery.
* Power-consuming 4G radios, a speedier processor and graphics and a taller display packing in more pixels will all require more juice so it remains to be seen if the next iPhone will be able to maintain decent battery life, especially given the iPhone 4S’s disappointing battery performance…
* Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White picked up a story by the Chinese news website Sina.com, writing in a note to investors this morning (via AppleInsider) that only 30 percent of the battery volumes produced currently meet Apple’s standards.
* The unnamed battery vendor is reportedly working to solve the problem as development of Apple’s next iPhone ramps up ahead of an anticipated release later this year.
* But all is good, the analyst writes, speculating:
* If there is a battery challenge, we trust that Apple will be able to figure it out in time for a September launch.
* I hope Apple doesn’t pull an iPhone 4S this time around.
* Isn’t it interesting how we’ve grown accustomed to a shorter battery life on the iPhone 4S compared to its predecessor?
* Even Steve Wozniak said as much in a January interview with The Daily Best:
* With the iPhone, something happened with the new OS or the new phone, and it just started running through the battery so fast. I’ve had a lot of issues with things I have to turn off just to save the battery life.
* Though there’s a lot more going on inside the iPhone 4S with its speedier hardware and Siri, the handset clearly suffers from software issues of sorts that degrade its battery performance. A few firmware updates later, the issue is far less evident, which isn’t saying it’s completely eradicated.
* How’s battery life on your iPhone 4S?
