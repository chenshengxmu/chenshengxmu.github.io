* By all accounts, T-Mobile isn’t getting the iPhone this year. The carrier will once again be put on the sidelines this month as the other three major US operators prepare for Apple’s massive handset launch.
* But that hasn’t kept T-Mobile from trying to get in on the action. Yesterday, it started distributing iPhone-friendly nano SIM kits to retailers. And according to a new report, it’s also prepping in-store iPhone displays…
* TmoNews is reporting that T-Mobile is getting ready to install in-store unlocked iPhone displays in an effort to demonstrate its refarmed network. The upgrade will allow users to access 3G data on their iPhones.
* “Our confidence level with this story is pretty high considering the sheer number of reports starting to come in regarding the idea that T-Mobile will have unlocked iPhones displayed in store running on T-Mobile’s 3G network. We’re pretty short on details but we do know that store managers were asked to activate a new microSIM before the end of August, but not told what device it would used with.”
* The site goes on to say that the in-store displays are a part of T-Mobile’s “bring your own iPhone” campaign. The carrier hopes that the combination of its refarmed network and new “truly unlimited” data plans will help lure subscribers over from other companies amid the likely shuffle this fall.
* It sounds like T-Mobile is making some good moves to help it make up for the fact that it’s not an official iPhone partner. It’ll be interesting to watch this campaign unfold and to see if it will have any effect on its bottom line.
* What do you think of T-Mobile’s play for iPhone customers? Will it work?
