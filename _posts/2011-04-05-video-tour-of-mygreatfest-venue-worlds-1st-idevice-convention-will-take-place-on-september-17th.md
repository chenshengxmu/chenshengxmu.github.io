* The folks at MyGreatFest will be holding the world’s first iDevice/jailbreak convention later this year in London, UK. Craig and the rest of the planning team have been working extremely hard over the past months to create the ultimate convention experience for jailbreak and iDevice enthusiasts.
* The details for September’s convention are shaping up nicely, and there is now a video tour of the venue. The Old Truman Brewery on Brick Lane in London will be where speakers like the creator of Cydia, saurik, present talks and presentations to fellow geeks.
* The space for the convention looks awesome, and we’re sure it will be the perfect place for speaker keynotes, vendors, iPhone gaming competitions, etc.
* Tickets are on sale for the September convention. The major down sight for those of us in U.S. is the fact that this year’s convention is taking place in Europe. The MyGreatFest team promises that the convention will be held in the U.S. next year, but for now, Europeans will get to benefit from this amazing networking and learning experience.
* MyGreatFest is also giving away a free iPad 2! Once they sell 500 convention wrist bands, they will announce the winner. Buying a wrist band enters you in the contest.
* Sebastien hopes to be able to attend MyGreatFest in September. We’ll be bringing you more coverage of MyGreatFest in the future.
* Are you interested in attending MyGreatFest? If you’re already across the pond, will you be participating in the world’s first iDevice convention?
