* If you prefer the lightweight feel of the iPad Air 2, but wish you could type like you were using your MacBook Air, the best thing you could do for yourself is invest in a good quality keyboard case. Not all cases are alike. A smooth, comfortable typing experience is very important when you need to stay productive.
* Belkin’s QODE Ultimate Pro is a fully loaded keyboard case for the iPad Air 2. The hard shell provides protection for your device, while the keyboard design provides a laptop typing experience.
* The aluminum alloy hard shell cover snaps onto the back of the iPad Air 2 and is detachable from the keyboard portion so you can take it with you when you don’t need the extra productivity. The case is specially designed with cutaways for ports and controls.
* The keyboard has the exact same number of keys as a laptop, which gives you a more familiar typing experience. The wider keycap shape makes it feel like you’ve got bigger keys, but they are not squished together.
* The board is also backlit with three different brightness settings, so you can type in different low-light situations and still see the keys.
* The Bluetooth pairing makes it possible for you to connect the keyboard to your iPad Air 2, as well as any other Bluetooth device. There are two pairing keys so you can have multiple devices paired at the same time. So, if you receive a text message while you are typing on your iPad, you can quickly switch over to respond on your iPhone and back again simply by pressing a key.
* The display stand has two viewing angles. Plus, you can rotate your iPad for landscape or portrait mode.
* Belkin’s QODE Ultimate Pro Keyboard Case for iPad Air 2 is available in black or white for $132 on Amazon.
