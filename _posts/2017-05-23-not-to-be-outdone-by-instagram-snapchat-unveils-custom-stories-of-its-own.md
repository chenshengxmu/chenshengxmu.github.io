* Just a few hours following Instagram’s announcement regarding all-new location and hashtag-based Stories in the app’s Explore tab, rival Snapchat just announced custom Stories of its own. Now there’s a new way to create Stories in Snapchat 10.9 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* You can create a custom Story in a specific location or with your cherry-picked friends. “It’s perfect for a trip, a birthday party or a new baby Story just for the family,” notes Snap.
* Tap the Create Story icon in the top-right corner of the Stories screen to get started.
* Song: “Sunroof” by courtship
* Of course, you have the tools at your disposal to control who can add to your Story and who can view it. And by using geofencing, you can attach your Story to a specific location. Your custom Story disappears automatically if no one has contributed to it in the past 24 hours.
* Aside from custom Stories, this edition of Snapchat puts your own Bitmoji selfie inside your Snapcode. To change the mood of your Bitmoji, just tap the Edit Bitmoji command.
* Grab Snapchat for free on App Store.
