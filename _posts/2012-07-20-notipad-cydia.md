title: NotiPad makes its way to Cydia
---
* NotiPad — the Growl inspired tweak for the iPad — has just appeared on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.00. The iPad exclusive tweak replaces the standard banner notifications in favor of Growl styled pop up notifications.
* There are a variety of different options built in with NotiPad, including the ability to alter the animations, and switch the side of the iPad’s screen that the notifications appear on.
* If you decide to check it out, be sure to drop us a line in the comments section.
