* We told you in January that Samsung and Apple CEOs were scheduled to meet for a new round of peace talks ahead of a trial next month. According to multiple reports today, the meeting between Apple CEO Tim Cook and Samsung mobile chief and co-CEO JK Shin indeed took place last week, but failed to yield tangible settlement opportunities.
* As a result of the failed talks, the two frenemies are definitely going to slug it out in the courtroom all over again in a second California trial scheduled to kick off on March 31, 2014. Grab your popcorn…
* ZDNet Korea reminds us that the court in San Jose, California overseeing the Apple v. Samsung litigation demanded an agreement by February 19, 2014.
* As no deal was reached, the court will announce its final verdict after February 19, with Samsung potentially looking to pay damages up to $930 million to Apple.
* A spokesperson for the Galaxy maker refused to confirm the outcome of the meeting. “We can’t confirm whether the two CEO met, or if they did, what the results were,” the company said.
* This development shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone as the two parties similarly failed to reach an amicable resolution to their long-standing legal disputes in 2012 mediation talks.
* The new trial, which begins March 31, will cover the latest Galaxy and iOS devices, including the iPhone 4s/5/5s/5c, the iPad Air and iPad mini, Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus III and more.
* Court documents revealed yesterday that Samsung plans to call Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, to the witness stand again. The executive will be asked questions concerning the design, development, promotion, marketing, advertising, consumer demand for and sales of the iPhone.
* Schiller also appears on Apple’s witness list and Samsung said it might call former iOS boss Scott Forstall to testify, too.
