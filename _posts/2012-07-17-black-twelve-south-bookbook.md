* Twelve South’s BookBook for the iPhone is arguably one of the most popular cases on the market today. Not only does it hold the handset, but it has a built-in wallet.
* Jeff reviewed the original BookBook case for us last fall, calling it one of his favorite iPhone accessories. But up until now, the cover has only been available in brown…
* Due to popular demand, Twelve South has decided to re-release its popular BookBook iPhone case in “Classic Black.” Here’s an excerpt from the press release:
* “Twelve South is pleased to unveil a Classic Black version of its best-selling BookBook for iPhone 4/4S as well as a refreshed Vintage Brown version. Like the original, the new black version of BookBook marries a wallet with an iPhone case, creating one must-have accessory.”
* For all of you folks that always said that you’d buy a BookBook case if it was ever offered in black, here you go. The new Classic Black version is compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, and is available in online for $59.99.
* It iss worth noting, however, that a new, larger iPhone is expected to drop sometime in the next few months. So keep that in mind while purchasing.
* Are you going to be buying the new BookBook case?
