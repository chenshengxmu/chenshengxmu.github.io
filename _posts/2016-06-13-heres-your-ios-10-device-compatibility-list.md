* Apple today during the WWDC 2016 keynote at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco announced next major versions of its four main operating systems—iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS—that power its iOS devices, set-top boxes, watches and computers.
* iOS 10, the tenth major revision of iOS, is now official, but will it work on your existing hardware? Not if you’re still on the iPhone 4s or want to run iOS 10 on the original iPad mini or iPads older than the iPad 4.
* Here’s a list of every Apple device that supports iOS 10:
* The major iOS 7 overhaul was compatible with any iPhone model from the iPhone 4 onward. iOS 8 and iOS 9, however, dropped iPhone 4 support so the iPhone 4s became the new bare minimum. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that iOS 10 has dropped support for the iPhone 4s, the original iPad mini and the third-generation iPad.
* A developer preview of iOS 10 is available starting today for those who are members of the Apple Developer Program. Public beta testers who are signed for the Apple Beta Software Program can download a beta of iOS 10 some time in July, said Apple.
* iOS 10 releases for public consumption this fall.
* iOS 10 supports any iPhone from the iPhone 5 onward, in addition to the sixth-generation iPod touch, a minimum fourth-generation iPad 4 or iPad mini 2 and later.
* For more info, check out Apple’s iOS 10 Preview webpage.
