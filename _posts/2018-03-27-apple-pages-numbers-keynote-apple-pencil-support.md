* Apple’s iWork productivity apps for iOS and macOS—Pages, Numbers and Keynote—were updated Tuesday morning with a bunch of really cool, compelling new features, as promised.
* In line with Apple’s education-focused press event earlier today, fans of Pages, Keynote and Numbers for iPhone and iPad can now use their Apple Pencil to draw, write and annotate directly in their documents, presentations and spreadsheets on a compatible device.
* In addition to bringing your documents and projects to life with drawings, illustrations, diagrams and more, Apple Pencil can also be used to easily and precisely add color, texture and other items to any drawing. A set of newly implemented real-time collaboration tools available in these apps allow students to explore and learn together.

* A Presenter mode in Pages transforms your iOS device into a virtual teleprompter for distraction-free reading. The text can auto scroll at an adjustable speed and its size, spacing, font and background color are all customizable during text playback. You can even collaborate in real-time in Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents stored in Box.
* Book creation, available in Pages for iOS and macOS, let anyone create interactive digital books that display in iBooks. There are a variety of Apple-designed templates to get you started with book creation, from short stories to travel books.
* “Users can start a book using a variety of templates, and then customize it with drawings using iWork’s new drawing tools or with image galleries and videos from their Photos library,” said Apple. You can even collaborate in real time on book projects with other folks.
* A new Smart Annotation feature is also very cool.

* Smart Annotations in Pages dynamically anchors proof marks to text within a document
* Available in Pages, this new feature lets you give, receive and incorporate feedback in a document using your Apple Pencil. What’s great about Smart Annotation is that your comments and proof marks are dynamically anchored to text and move as you move text around. As another user integrates feedback and the document changes, remaining annotations will stay with the text they were attached to.
* Smart Annotation is currently in beta.
* Grab Pages, Keynote and Numbers for iOS on App Store or update your copy of Pages, Keynote and Numbers for macOS through Mac App Store.
