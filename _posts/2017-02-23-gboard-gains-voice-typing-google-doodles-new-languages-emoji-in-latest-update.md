* Gboard, Google’s iPhone keyboard that comes with Google Search, glide typing, GIFs, emojis and other advanced features built in, received a notable refresh on App Store. Bumped to version 1.3, Gboard includes support for fifteen new languages and brings a useful dictation feature that Google is calling Voice Typing. Additionally, you can now see a day’s Google Doodle right from the keyboard and enjoy Apple’s latest iOS 10 emoji.
* Gboard now works in the following languages:
* To type, search and share in these new languages, go to Languages → Add Language in the Gboard app. “We’ve also increased support for the universal language—emoji. Now you can search and send all of the latest emoji from iOS 10,” said Google.
* As third-party keyboards on iOS are not allowed to use some of the more advanced features available to Apple’s stock QuickType keyboard, such as predictions and dictation, Google has taken it upon themselves to implement their own dictation system.
* With Voice Typing, you can tap the microphone button to dictate messages on the go.

* As mentioned, Gboard now supports Google Doodles.
* For those unfamiliar with Doodles, they’re basically fun updates to the Google logo celebrating special dates throughout the year, such as events and famous birthdays.
* “Doodles are one of the Googley-est things about Google,” said the search giant. “These fun animations honor holidays, anniversaries and notable people, and often teach you about a little slice of history.”

* And now, Doodles are accessible right from your Gboard keyboard. On days when there’s a Doodle, Gboard’s “G” button will animate. Simply tap the “G” button whenever it animates to open up the day’s Doodle and search for more information about it.
* More new features and languages are to be expected in future updates, Google said.
* Grab Gboard for free from App Store.
