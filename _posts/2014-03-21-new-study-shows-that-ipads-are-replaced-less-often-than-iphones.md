* While most iPhone users look to upgrade their Apple smartphone once every two years, coinciding with the end of their contracts, a new report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reveals that the iPad has a much longer replacement cycle. Based on a survey of 2,000 customers in the United States who purchased an iPhone, iPad or Mac last year, the tablet is believed to be closer aligned to the Mac’s average lifespan of 2 to 4 years…

* The iPhone and iPad have a lot of usage similarities, especially considering that both devices have access to the App Store. But while 8 out of 10 people will replace their broken, lost or stolen iPhone within two days, only about half will replace their iPads in that timespan. This isn’t necessarily a surprising statistic, considering that most people probably wouldn’t even consider leaving their house for the day without an iPhone by their side.

* The iPad, on the other hand, is used more like a Mac, TV or iPod. Per Fortune:
* “We think Apple would prefer the iPad become a big iPhone,” the report concludes. “We suspect, though, based on recent CIRP data about how buyers use them, that it’s as much like a Mac, TV, or iPod, with less frequent replacement.”
* The report provides some other interesting stats about the iPad, including that over 4 out of 10 people will gift their older tablet to a family member or friend after purchasing a new one. iPhone users are far more likely to trade in their smartphones when it comes time to upgrade, supporting the stat that only 1% to 2% of iPhone buyers are purchasing their first phone. Comparatively, the percentage of first-time iPad buyers was 78% in December 2013.
* How often do you purchase a new iPad?
