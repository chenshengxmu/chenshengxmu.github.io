* One of the most controversial rumors regarding the upcoming iPad 3 has been whether or not the tablet will feature 4G technology. While countries like the US and Canada have growing LTE networks, others won’t see the tech for at least a year.
* Tonight, the Wall Street Journal seemingly puts an end to the speculation. The world-renown newspaper is reporting that it has confirmed that both Verizon and AT&T flavored iPad 3s will include the next-generation wireless technology…
* The WSJ writes:
* “Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. will sell a version of the coming iPad that runs on their newest fourth-generation wireless networks, according to people familiar with the matter, as the battle to cash in on big investments in mobile broadband heats up.”
* Apple is expected to unveil its new tablet on Wednesday, March 7th, and should be available for purchase sometime shortly after that.
* Is anyone else excited to hear that the iPad 3 will be LTE-capable?
