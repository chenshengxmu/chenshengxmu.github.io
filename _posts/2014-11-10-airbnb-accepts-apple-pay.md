* Airbnb, a popular mobile travel-planning app, issued an update during the weekend which added Apple Pay support to its iOS app. Of course, the ability to book your future trips with Apple Pay requires an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus for the time being.
* But with the debut of Apple Watch in early 2015 Apple Pay will be supported on older iPhones that lack NFC, from the iPhone 5 onward.
* The sign-up experience is reworked to remove friction, KakaoTalk sharing is new and a simplified Account screen makes managing settings less cumbersome than before.
* Airbnb is available free in the App Store.
* If you want, Airbnb now supports sharing of your Wishlists and listings with contacts on KakaoTalk, a mobile messaging application with free text and VoIP features used by 140 million users around the world.
* KakaoTalk is an absolute hit in South Korea, where the app reaches an astounding 93 percent of smartphones in use.
* Airbnb 4.5.1 changelog
* Airbnb provides access to more than 600,000 listings in more than 34,000 cities around the world. You can message hosts and guests, gush over your itinerary, explore fairytale destinations and add unforgettable digs to your Wish list.
* Yes, there’s a widget for iOS 8 available, too, so you can keep track of your schedules and events right in the Today view within the Notification Center.
* Airbnb, a 46.7-megabyte download is supported natively on any iPhone or iPod touch compatible with iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
