* If you’ve ordered an iPhone XS, or are planning to, you’re going to want to strongly consider picking up a case. The good news is, because the XS is identical to the iPhone X, there are already a ton of cases available for it. So we decided to put together a roundup of some of our favorites from every style and price point.

* For years, the thin [scarf] case from Totallee has been my go-to case. Other companies claim to make “minimal” or “ultra-thin” cases, but few live up to the description better than Totallee. This case measures just 0.02-inches thin, weighs just 0.1 oz, is extremely easy to put on and remove, and features no visible branding or gaudy designs. It’s not going to save your iPhone in the event of a nasty drop, but it will give it a grippier texture and protect it from scuffs and scratches.
* Buy for $18

* The Rugged Case from Nomad is a minimalist combination of protection and class. It features a high grade polycarbonate fused to a rubber TPE bumper and a premium vegetable-tanned Horween leather back. The bumper sits raised above the display for added protection and the leather develops a rich patina through extended use. Nomad says the case can withstand drops from up to 10ft.
* Buy for $45

* Incipio is another staple in the world of iPhone cases. They’re a little more what I call “designer,” with unique designs and branding, and a little more expensive, but they typically have a premium feel to them. For the iPhone XS, I really like the Dualpro Sport Case. As the name indicates, the case has a hybrid design with a rigid Plextonium shell and impact-absorbing silicon, meaning it was built to withstand drops. It’s soft to the touch, and features a sharp-looking crosshatch pattern (though it’s not nearly as bold in-person as it appears in the above photo).
* Buy for $27

* The Presidio from Speck is another one of my favorites. It’s transparent, so you can still show off the beautiful design of the iPhone XS, and it features just a tiny Speck logo in the upper right hand corner. But it’s thicker than some of the ultra-thin cases, like the totallee mentioned above, for greater protection. It features a polycarbonate shell construction with Impactium—a dynamic shock-absorbing material— and raised bezels that protect the screen. Speck says the case has been tested to withstand falls from up to 8 feet.
* Buy for $21

* If you’re in need of a more rugged iPhone XS case, designed to take a little more punishment, check out the Commuter Series from OtterBox. The name OtterBox is synonymous with toughness, and their long-running Commuter case line offers superior protection without the bulk. The iPhone XS case features a lightweight 2-piece design  capable of withstanding drops, as well as port covers to protect against dust and dirt. Comes with a limited lifetime warranty.
* Buy for $36

* The Veil XT case from Caudabe is another ultra-thin case that eschews gaudy branding and design for a more minimal look (although there is a small logo located towards the Lightning port). It measures just 0.35mm thin, but it’s thick enough on the back to protect the iPhone’s protruding iSight camera. It also features a snug fit and cutouts for all buttons and ports.
* Buy for $15
* Obviously, this is just a few of the iPhone XS cases out there. We will be adding to this list as we get more review units and as more become available to order. If you know of a case available right now that you think deserves to be on this list, let us know in the comments below!
