* TinyUmbrella, the tool that allows users to save SHSH blobs to be used for potential downgrades, has received another update. As we reported a few weeks ago, TinyUmbrella has made a significant comeback, and its developer, semaphore, is hopeful that downgrades to iOS firmware will be a real thing in the not so distant future.
* With this in mind, semaphore is continuing to improve TinyUmbrella, and this latest beta version contains numerous fixes and iterative enhancements. If you still haven’t saved your SHSH blobs, I advise you to stop what you’re doing, download TinyUmbrella, and do so today.
* Here is the full change log for this latest beta release:
* You can download the 8.2.0.41 beta from TinyUmbrella’s website. If you need help, see our initial post on the tool’s comeback, and watch our TinyUmbrella video embedded below:
* Semaphore states that even more goodies are coming in future beta updates. These include on-device SHSH fetching for A7 and A8 devices, and more.
* Again, it is highly recommended that you download TinyUmbrella and save your blobs today if you think you might ever want to downgrade in the future. I look at it as a good insurance policy for protecting jailbreaks and potential jailbreaks. What do you think about it?
