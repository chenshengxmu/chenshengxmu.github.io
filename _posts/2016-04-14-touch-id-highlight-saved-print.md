* Registering more than one finger with the Touch ID system is a sure-fire way of improving the overall accuracy of fingerprint recognition on your Touch ID-enabled iPhone or iPad.
* If you have registered  multiple fingerprints, it’s also helpful to name them (i.e. index finger, right thumb, etc.), as one of our recent tutorials explained.
* Naming a fingerprint is super useful, for sure.
* But in its typical fashion, Apple’s gone one step further: though most people will be aware of this, novice users may be oblivious to the fact that they can easily highlight in the list of registered fingers a finger that Touch ID matches.
* 1) Launch Settings on your iPhone or iPad.
* 2) Tap Touch ID & Passcode and type in your passcode to access this section.
* 3) Touch the Home button with one of your enrolled fingers. The matched fingerprint in the list will be highlighted briefly, as shown top of post.
* Tip: To rename a saved finger, tap its default name in the list and then type a new one.

* Aside from registering multiple fingerprints with Touch ID, you can actually use this feature to improve the accuracy and reliability of fingerprint recognition on a Touch ID-enabled iPhone or iPad.
* Though not a documented feature, if you keep touching the Home button with one of your enrolled fingers at a slight angle, or curve the finger to the side or slide it up a bit more on the Home button so that the Settings app barely highlights it, iOS will use that data to enhance your fingerprint profile, improving Touch ID accuracy as a result.

* Speaking of Touch ID,  make sure iTunes & App Store is turned on under Settings → Touch ID & Passcode if you want to use your fingerprint instead of your Apple ID password for making purchases in the iTunes Store, App Store and iBooks Store.
