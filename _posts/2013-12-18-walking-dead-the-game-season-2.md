* Based on Robert Kirkman’s award-winning comic books, the game puts you in the shoes of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse.

* Many months have passed since the events seen in Season One of The Walking Dead, and Clementine is searching for safety. But what can an ordinary child do to stay alive when the living can be just as bad — and sometimes worse — than the dead?
