* HomePod can’t be used as a regular Bluetooth speaker even though it has Bluetooth 5.0.
* That’s because it only uses Bluetooth for proximity information, which lets you bring your iPhone near during the setup process to transfer common settings to the device over the air.
* Apple’s refreshed Tech Specs page for HomePod lists the following supported audio sources:
* As you can see, Bluetooth is not mentioned as an audio source.
* While the smart speaker does support third-party services like Spotify through Apple’s proprietary AirPlay protocol, the ability to play music from a non-Apple device, like an Android phone, via Bluetooth would admittedly enhance its functionality greatly.
* As a result, Apple Music subscribers with Android phones are seemingly out of luck. I also think that an ecosystem lock-in on a friggin’ speaker is not a good idea.
* It’s unclear if Apple may enable Bluetooth audio streaming functionality down the road via a firmware update. I don’t think that’s going to happen because HomePod is all about audio quality. Bluetooth is well-known for its not-so-great audio quality due to compression.
* HomePod goes on sale on February 9.
