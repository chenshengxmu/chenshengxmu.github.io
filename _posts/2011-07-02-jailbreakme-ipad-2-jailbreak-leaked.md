* After weeks of anticipation, we knew that the release of JailbreakMe was imminent. The clues and hints that Comex had left behind were just too obvious. What we didn’t expect, though, was that one of the beta testers for JailbreakMe would leak it out to the world.
* Links starting popping up on several websites this morning, and by simply opening a PDF document from your device (yes, including the iPad 2), you were able to install Cydia, much like you install an app from the App Store…
* Now here is some sort of disclaimer that I hope you will take the time to read. We felt we had to report the news to everyone because that’s what we do here at iDB. But I have to admit – and I believe I can speak for the whole iDB team – that I am extremely disappointed to see that someone who Comex trusted enough to let him beta test his latest creation has leaked it out to the world. This is very saddening and I hope this won’t turn Comex off from working on iOS jailbreaks again in the future. Whoever leaked this should be ashamed.

* That being said, it seems that most, if not all, of the links to the leaked JailbreakMe, have been taken down. While we thought this leak was just a fake, we got confirmation from the fine folks at Redmond Pie that it was indeed real and working. We were not able to verify that information as we didn’t try this ourselves.
* The video below shows this unofficial version of JailbreakMe in action on an iPad 2.
* At this point, we were only able to find a JailbreakMe jailbreak for iPad 2 Wi-Fi. You can try it by visiting this site from your iPad 2 running iOS 4.3, which should install Cydia on your springboard. Reboot and you should be good to go.
* We’ve been waiting for JailbreakMe for a few weeks now, so I highly recommend you wait for the official release to come out instead of using links from unknown sources online. As far as I know, these links may include viruses or anything else you might not want to put on your iDevice.
* If you do try it though, we want to hear from you. Let us know how it went by leaving a comment below.
* UPDATE: We’ve been hearing from multiple sources that this leaked exploit only works on iOS 4.3.0. All newer iOS versions are not compatible. The links to the 4.3.3 exploit have been taken down, presumably because the person that leaked the exploit wants more YouTube subscribers first.
