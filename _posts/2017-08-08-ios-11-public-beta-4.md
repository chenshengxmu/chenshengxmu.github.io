* Apple on Tuesday released a fourth public beta of iOS 11 to members of its Beta Software Program. Available over the air via the Software Update mechanism, the new public beta has the same features like a fifth beta for developers which dropped yesterday.
* With the new beta, Apple continues to refine iOS 11 ahead of its launch this fall.
* Some app icons have been redesigned slightly in the new beta. Moreover, iOS 11’s much-improved Control Center continues to be refined with functional changes.
* Note that the ability for the Messages app to sync your entire chat archive across devices through iCloud has been temporarily removed from this beta.

* You’re recommended to perform a full backup of your iOS device before installing the beta.

* Before you can install the iOS public beta, sign in with your Apple ID at beta.apple.com.
* Next, visit beta.apple.com/profile in iOS Safari to download Apple’s configuration profile, which permits your device to receive over-the-air public beta software updates.
* Lastly, go to Settings → General → Software Update to install the latest iOS public beta.
* To report bugs to Apple, use the included Feedback Assistant app.
* Originally released as a developer-only preview at WWDC in June, iOS 11 includes all-new iPad multitasking features with an interactive Dock, drag and drop and more.
