title: Funny or Dies iSteve trailer hits the web
---
* Funny or Die production, the popular comedy web site founded by Will Ferrel’s production company, last month announced work on a full-length Steve Jobs movie dubbed iSteve and starring Justin Long as Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs. With the first official trailer having been posted to the Funny or Die web site, it looks as if this flick is actually a more serious depiction of Steve Jobs rather than a typical Funny or Die comedy production…
* Kudos to the German web site Apfelpage.de for discovering the trailer.
* You can also check it out on the Funny or Die web site.
* Justin Long, of course, became a household name thanks to his portrayal of the hip Mac character in Apple’s long-running Mac vs. PC advertising campaign.
* iSteve is Funny or Die’s longest project in its six-year history and The New York Times quoted director Ryan Perez as saying that “in true Internet fashion, it’s not based on very thorough research — essentially a cursory look at the Steve Jobs Wikipedia page.”
* “It’s very silly,” he added, “but it looks at his whole life.”
* The flick is slated to premier online on April 15.
* So, what do you think?
* Is iSteve going to flop?
