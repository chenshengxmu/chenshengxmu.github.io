* Handset vendors stubbornly insist on making their gadgets thinner at a time when consumers have largely been craving for better battery life.
* Apple, like no other company, is a poster child for the industry’s obsession with thinness. Whenever a new iPhone comes out, its slim profile gets prominently featured and communicated in ads.
* This point was especially brought home for me in a recent Wall Street Journal article which argues that “survey after survey reveals there is one thing consumers wish manufacturers would change about their gadgets” and it’s better battery life.
* Our poll today deals with this issue as we seek to learn whether you, our loyal readers, would rather have a millimeter or two thicker device with a stronger battery or as thins a phone as possible with a good enough battery.
* So, would you trade thinness for better battery life?
* Would you trade iPhone thinness for better battery life?
* A similar poll we ran last summer ahead of the iPhone 6 release asked whether screen size or battery life were more important to you. Nearly one out of each four respondents opted for a stronger battery versus a larger screen.
* Arguing that making gadgets thinner and lighter is a trend that has outlived its usefulness, WSJ writer Christopher Mims said that things don’t have to be this way.
* “There’s a simple enough solution,” he wrote. “It requires a company brave enough to persuade users that one of the things we’ve come to expect from phones and other gadgets — that every year, they become thinner and lighter — is a trend that has outlived its usefulness.”
* I couldn’t agree more, but would Apple be brave enough to come out with a thicker-than-expected iPhone? Personally, I’d happily buy a bit thicker iPhone were it to come with markedly better battery life.
* And what do you think?
* Should Apple thicken the next iPhone in order to improve battery life or avoid doing that as to not risk reviewers calling the device a brick?
