* While the new iPhone 8/Plus will start at $699/$799, resulting in a price bump of $50 for those who want the latest thing, Appleâ€™s most affordable handset can now be had for $50 less.
* This is what the price-adjusted iPhone SE lineup looks like:
* When it debuted in March 2016 as a budget option, Apple originally offered iPhone SE at $399 for the entry-level 16GB model and $499 for the higher-capacity 64GB version.
* The 64GB iPhone SE was slashed to $449 following the September 2016 iPhone 7 launch.
* In March 2017, Apple again reshuffled the lineup by offering twice the storage on the low-end model with no price hike while bringing the top-tier back to $499 while doubling its storage.
* This has resulted in the 32GB/128GB offerings at $399/$499.
* Now that the company has quietly cut the price of the two iPhone SE models by $50, people in the market for a four-inch phone can now purchase iPhone SE its lowest price ever.
* Like before, the device continues to be available in Silver, Gold, Space Gray and Rose Gold.
