* Apple on Wednesday seeded the second beta version of iOS 9.1 to developers. The software is available to registered developers either over-the-air, for those running the first iOS 9.1 beta, or via Apple’s developer website.
* Introduced earlier this month, iOS 9.1 will bring about new features for the just-announced iPad Pro, such as support for new accessories. The update also includes support for Unicode 8, which will add several new emoji.
* Today’s release comes one week after Apple launched iOS 9 to the public. That update brings about a significant number of changes and improvements, including Apple’s new News app, enhanced Siri and Maps, and more.
* We’re currently installing today’s 9.1 beta, and will let you know if we spot any major changes. If you see something we missed that you feel is worth noting, let us know in the comments below or at tips@idownloadblog.com.
