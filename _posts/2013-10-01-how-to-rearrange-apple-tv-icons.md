* Power users no doubt are aware of this nifty little feature, but I’m posting it here anyway for the folks who may not have known that their $99 set-top streamer includes ability to adjust the arrangement and display of icons on the main menu, iPhone style. Moving the icons around couldn’t be simpler.
* All you need is an Apple TV running the Apple TV 5.1 software or later and a remote – Apple’s own remote will do just fine, but you can pair most infrared controllers to your device.
* Let me show you how to rearrange those icons…
* To change where an icon appears on the main menu, follow these four easy steps:
* Note that the above method does not work with Apple’s stock apps – only third-party apps can be moved around. Specifically, you can’t move or rearrange the icons in the top row: Movies, TV Shows, Music, Computers and Settings.

* You may also want to selectively show or hide the icons, third-party or not, using a little-known feature nested under the Settings > General > Restrictions menu (Settings > General > Parental Controls for those that have not updated their box to the new Apple TV 6.0 software).
* To show or hide any icon from the Apple TV’s main menu, go to Restrictions/Parental Controls, scroll down and select either Show or Hide next to a desired app. I have posted detailed instructions on hiding unwanted icons in this how-to article.

* On a final note, enabling Restrictions/Parental Controls will prevent others from changing these settings. And if you want to stop your kids from using apps like YouTube, set up a four-digit passcode in Restrictions and choose a third Ask option instead of Show or Hide.
* If you stumble upon another neat Apple TV trick, feel free to share it with fellow readers down in the comments or drop me a line on tips@idownloadblog.com for consideration in future articles.
