* Apple has started denying vacation requests from employees for the 2nd week of October, indicating that the company expects a high influx of customers during that time.
* Rumors have suggested that the next iPhone launch will take place in the 2nd week of October alongside the public launch of iOS 5 and iCloud. Apple is expected to hold its next media event on October 4th to announce its new products for the holiday season…
* AppleInsider reports:
* “Apple is quietly denying requests for employee vacations during the second week of October, hinting that the company currently anticipates an influx of customers to its stores around that time related to availability of its new iOS 5 and fifth-generation iPhone products.
* More specifically, the iPhone maker has in some locations blacked out vacation time for employees from October 9th through 12th and October 14th through 15th, according to people familiar with the matter.”
* Apple has told its AppleCare employees to expect an influx of iOS 5-related questions on Monday, October 10th. This would suggest that Apple plans to release iOS 5 to the public first, followed by next generation iPhone hardware later in the week.
* The iPhone 4 was made available on a Thursday, and Apple could very well follow suit with an October 13th release date. Friday, October 14th could also be a potential date for carrier availability.
* Apple denying employees vacation time for product launches is to be expected, as all hands will be needed to handle new customers.
* Will you be lining up for whatever Apple is selling during the 2nd week of October?
