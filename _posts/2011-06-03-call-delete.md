* Ever wished you could delete individual phone calls from your call logs on your iPhone? If so, Call Delete is the app for you. Up until now, you could only delete none or all of the missed or placed phone calls from your iPhone, but Call Delete is going to change that by giving you a little more freedom.
* Just like you would guess, Call Delete lets you delete specific phone calls from your iPhone logs. If you recently called your ex and you don’t want your new girlfriend to find out, this is going to do the trick…
* After installing the app, you will get an “Edit” button, which when hit will let you delete calls from your log. Not a groundbreaking application but I’m sure some of you will find it useful.
* Call Delete doesn’t add any icon to your springboard, but it does allow you to configure the options from the Settings application.
* You can get Call Delete from the BigBoss repo for $1.29. What do you think?
