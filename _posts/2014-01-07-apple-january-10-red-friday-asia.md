* Apple has announced that it will be holding a one-day special sales event in a number of key Asian markets this coming Friday, January 10.
* The promotion known as Red Friday is in celebration of the Lunar New Year, which refers to the beginning of the year in several calendars across Asia. The shopping event actually takes place three weeks before the Lunar New Year.
* Red Friday is akin to Black Friday in the United States, the Friday following Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday of November) which unofficially marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season in the States.
* And what surprises and discounts does Apple have in store for its customers in Asia? Read on for the full reveal…
* According to a teaser web page on the Hong Kong Online Apple Store, Red Friday will be “the perfect day to pick the perfect gift”.
* Just like in years past, Apple’s online and brick-and-mortar stores across China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand will be offering discounts on select products.
* The company hasn’t specified the discounts yet, but if past promotions are anything to go by eager shoppers should expect some rather modest discounts on Macs, iOS devices and accessories.
* Sale prices will be limited to stock on hand while supplies last. Quantity of products purchasable by each customer may be limited, Apple noted.
* Last week, the iPhone maker held its annual Lucky Bags promotion in Japan, named due to the fact of shoppers not knowing what they were getting until they looked inside the 36,000 yen (approximately $345 USD) mystery bags filled with random products and accessories.
