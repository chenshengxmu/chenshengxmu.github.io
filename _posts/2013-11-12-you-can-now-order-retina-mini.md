* If you are looking to pickup an iPad mini with Retina display, you’re going to want to head over to your Apple web store as soon as possible. The highly anticipated tablet just went on sale, starting at $399.
* The move has caught both tech pundits and consumers off guard, as up until now, Apple has maintained that the new mini’s launch date would be ‘later in November.’ Well, Christmas came early this year…

* As you can see from this screenshot, early reports of limited inventory were spot-on. Instead of being available immediately, most models show 5-10 day shipping times, with just two showing 1-3 days.
* In fact, it’s likely that this odd, unannounced launch of the Retina iPad mini is the result of constrained supplies. Perhaps Apple didn’t want millions of people trying to simultaneously purchase the tablet.
* Anyway, tonight’s release comes shortly after a post on an internal Apple site called for an early debut. It’s worth noting that at this time, in-store pickup isn’t available and there’s no word on retail launch.
