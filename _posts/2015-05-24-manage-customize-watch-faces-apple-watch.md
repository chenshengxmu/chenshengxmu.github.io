* The watch face is what you will see the majority of the time while using your Apple Watch. After all, regardless of all of the cool things that it can do with apps, glances, and the like, it’s still a digital watch in its most basic form.
* That said, the Apple Watch is one of the deepest watches that you can by from a feature standpoint. Even when it comes to something as simple as a watch face, things veer from the shallow.
* In a previous post, we showed you how to change your Apple Watch face. In this post, we’ll discuss more basics and teach you how to manage and customize watch faces.
* Features, also referred to as complications, are special functions that allow you to display more information on your watch face in addition to the time. As you’ll see, there are many features available on the Apple Watch, but some features are only available on specific Apple Watch faces.
* Here is a list of all of the watch face features available on the Apple Watch thus far:
* To add a feature to a watch face, you must be using a face that supports features. Some faces, like the Motion or X-Large face don’t support features.
* Step 1: Force Touch the screen while on the watch face
* Step 2: Tap the Customize button

* Step 3: Tap on the section that you wish to customize, and it will be highlighted with a green box
* Step 4: Use the Digital Crown to scroll through and select a specific feature
* Step 5: Press the Digital Crown again to accept your changes
* Note that you may need to swipe between pages on the watch face if applicable. Some watch faces allow you to customize things like color on the first page, while allowing you to customize features on the second or third page.
* You can build a new watch face using templates based on pre-existing watch faces.
* Step 1: Force Touch the screen while on the watch face
* Step 2: Swipe left until you see the New button
* Step 3: Tap the New button

* Step 4: Use the Digital Crown to move through existing templates
* Step 5: Tap on the template that you wish to use and it will be appended to the end of your list of available watch faces
* You can then customize the new watch face without the changes touching an already existing watch face of the same name. This is a pretty handy feature to use if you want two watch faces of the same type with different features.
* Any watch face can be deleted, including the ones that come bundled with your Apple Watch by default. To delete an Apple Watch face, do the following:
* Step 1: Force Touch the screen while on the watch face
* Step 2: Swipe until you find the watch face that you wish to remove
* Step 3: Swipe up on the watch face that you want to delete
