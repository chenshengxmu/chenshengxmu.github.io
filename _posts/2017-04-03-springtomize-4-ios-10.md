* A major milestone for the iOS 10 jailbreak is officially here; the highly popular Springtomize jailbreak tweak is now compatible with iOS 10 thanks to its latest release, which was a joint effort between iOS developers Filippo Bigarella and Janosch Hübner (sharedRoutine).
* Springtomize 4 has been re-written from top to bottom with improvements to not only its design, but also to its set of features. In this piece, we’ll go over everything you can expect from Springtomize 4.
* Springtomize has a solid reputation for being one of the most consistent all-in-one jailbreak tweaks in the Cydia store to date, and has earned its respect and seniority over similar tweaks that have been released in recent years. Springtomize 4 has more than 100 features baked into it, which is significantly more than any typical jailbreak tweak release.
* Springtomize 4 is a testament to the tweak’s original mission statement: to give users a way to customize every aspect of their iPhone or iPad’s SpringBoard, from top to bottom.
* Inside of the Springtomize 4 preferences pane, which gets added to the Settings app, users will find a bevy of familiar options to explore. The options are plentiful, and are divided into groups depending on what they modify:

* At the top of the preferences pane is a killswitch for the Springtomize 4 as a whole, but right below that are all of the main preference panes. Because there are so many to discuss, we’ll outline them as quickly as possible for your convenience:
* Animations, App Switcher, and Control Center

* In these preference panes, you’ll find options for:
* For the most part, that wraps up the main configuration of Springtomize 4. A lot of the settings are going to be familiar to you if you’ve used a previous version of Springtomize before, but Filippo tells me there are some new animation effects and other options mixed into the tweak that weren’t there previously, so those are Easter Eggs you’ll find when you get the new Springtomize.
* One of the major points of focus of Springtomize 4 that wasn’t there previously is the addition of profiles, and yes, these are exactly what they sound like!

* Profiles will let you save a snapshot of your Springtomize settings so you can apply them again at a later date with just a tap. This is a big win for themers, as it lets you have multiple profiles so that each group of settings can match a particular theme.
* Even if you’re not a themer, you can make good use of the profiles feature. If you’re feeling a little adventurous one day and more minimalist another, profiles will let you make a profile for each scenario so you can move between each with a single tap.
* For example, perhaps you will enable the more adventurous profile when you want to show someone why it’s cool to jailbreak your device and then go back to the minimalist settings when you’re done.
* Obviously, your experience with profiles may vary, since everybody has their own definition of what makes a great jailbroken iPhone. For that reason, feel free to experiment with profiles until you get something you like.
* Springtomize 4 is not a free upgrade from any previous versions of Springtomize, so here’s what you need to know about the pricing:
* As always, Springtomize 4 is being offered in Cydia’s BigBoss repository. If you want to save money, we suggest purchasing the tweak within the first week after launch to take advantage of the sale. If you own an earlier version, then you’ll save a good chunk off the retail price.
* Springtomize 4 is intended only for iOS 10 devices. If you are using iOS 9 or earlier, check out Springotmize 3 or earlier instead.
