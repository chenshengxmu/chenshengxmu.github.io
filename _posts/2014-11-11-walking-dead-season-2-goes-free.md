* The Walking Dead: The Game — Season 2 has gone free for the first time following its December 2013 App Store debut.
* Created by Telltale Games and based on the namesake comic book series by the Eisner Award-winning writer Robert Kirkman, the five-episode adventure game follows the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse.
* Keep in mind that only the first “All That Remains” chapter is available at no cost, with the remaining four episodes titled “A House Divided,” “In Harm’s Way,” “Amid the Ruins” and “No Going Back” available as In-App Purchases.
* Grab the game now for free before it goes back up to its regular asking price of $4.99.
* There’s no word how long this promotion will run so I’d get downloading immediately if I were you.

* Telltale is also teasing the first episode of an upcoming episodic graphic adventure game adaptation of HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” Titled “Iron from Ice,” it gives us a good overview of what to expect of this six-part episodic game, launching on iOS “soon.”

* And partnering with Skybound Entertainment and Zen Studios, Telltale recently released The Walking Dead Pinball in the App Store for $1.99.
* More #GameOfThrones info VERY soon, but before that, almost time for the world premiere 'Tales from the Borderlands' trailer. Stay close!
