* Yesterday we showed you how to manually replace the carrier logo in your status bar with the iDB logo. Today, iDB fanatic reader iPhoneiHelper decided to create his own set of iDB logos and put them on Cydia.
* If you have Zepellin installed on your iPhone, go to Cydia and download the iDownloadBlog Logos for Zeppelin pack…
* And while you’re at it, check out iPhoneiHelper other carrier logo replacements for Zeppelin. He has a really cool pack that will bring Steve Jobs to your status bar!
* iDownloadBlog Logos for Zeppelin are available for free from the BigBoss repo.
* We love it when iDB readers go the extra mile for us. If you want to show your love for iDB too, make sure to get in touch with us and we will feature your work on the site.
