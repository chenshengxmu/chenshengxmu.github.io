* We already warned you, but it might be the right time to remind you again that iPhone 4S and iPad 2 owners should update to iOS 5.0.1 asap, should they want to be able to jailbreak, when that A5 jailbreak is released.
* According to recent reports, the Corona exploit has been patched in iOS 5.1. This means the upcoming jailbreak will probably work on iOS 5.0.1 only, and if Apple released iOS 5.1 before the jailbreak is released, then you might get out of luck and unable to jailbreak. BigBoss explains:
* Apple is due to release 5.1 soon. When that happens, they will stop signing 5.0.1. This means you will only be able to restore to 5.1. 5.1 breaks the upcoming jailbreak. If you are currently a 4s owner or an ipad 2 owner, you will want to get your device to 5.0.1 ASAP. This way when the jailbreak is released, you will be able to use it. If you do not restore to 5.0.1 now, in a few days when 5.1 is out, you may never be able to get from 5.0 to 5.0.1 and only option will be to wait again.
* You can either update over the air or by syncing your device with iTunes.
