* There’s really not much to say here. If you’ve ever used or seen an Apple TV 2, then you know exactly what to expect here. Physically the two devices are indistinguishable.
* The only difference between the 2nd generation Apple TV and the 3rd generation Apple TV is that the latter supports 1080p resolution courtesy of a new A5 single core chip. Other than there, everything inside the box, all of the connectors — everything — is the same…
* The only way to tell the two devices apart with the eyes is by looking at the model number on the bottom of the device, but even that’s very tiny.
* 2nd generation Apple TV = A1378. 3rd generation? A1427.
* Have you purchased a new Apple TV? Are you excited to finally have 1080p resolution output capabilities?
