* Sega’s Sonic games for the iPhone and iPad are as popular as on any other platform and the games maker has certainly given its best issuing updates with new levels and discounting the Sonic games on the App Store.
* In addition to Sonic, Sega is one of the most prolific game developers whose varied releases for Apple’s platform include Crazy Taxi, After Burner Climax, Jet Set Radio and lots of other iOS titles, even including exclusives such as Sonic Jump.
* Sega of America on Monday announced its 2013 winter iOS lineup, including a remastered version of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 and a brand new game called Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing: Transformed. I’ve included detailed information above the fold…
* TouchArcade reports about Sega’s winter iOS lineup that includes remastered Sonic The Hedgehog 2, the new Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing: Transformed, Rhythm Thief & The Paris Caper, Demon Tribe and Go Dance.
* The latter title, released ten days ago and now available on the App Store for $1.99, uses your device’s FaceTime camera to capture your moves as you dance to the beats of a LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, Avicii, Flo Rida and other artists.
* As for Sonic The Hedgehog 2, the remastered version will include improved graphics, better touch controls and “a rock solid framerate” running at 60FPS. Sega previously remastered the original Sonic The Hedgehog with similar enhancements back in May.
* According to Sega’s media release, “Sonic fans and newcomers alike will see Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in a brand new light”.
* The game will be a free update for users who already own the original iOS game and is due in November.

* Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing: Transformed (above) is a Mario-like kart racing game coming as a new installment in the Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. iA pared down version of the existing console Transformed game, the mobile edition will contain a brand new World Tour mode designed for gaming on the go and include multiplayer both locally and online for up to four players.
* The game is due in winter.
* Rhythm Thief & The Paris Caper (below), an adaptation of the 2012 Nintendo 3DS rhythm game, takes place “across iconic locations in Paris as you play rhythm-based mini-games in an effort to unravel the mystery behind your father’s disappearance”.

* According to TouchArcade which saw work-in-progress code, the wacky game spans 50 missions, features 20 different songs and has “a ton of personality”, with the mini-games being described as “fast-paced” and “challenging”.
* The title is slated to launch early next year.
* Finally, Demon Tribe (below), a free to play card collection action-based role-playing game (RPG) coming this winter, challenges you to build up a team of fighters and catch demons to gain their powers and upgrade your stats.

* The publication notes:
* You can also use “Demon Summoning” abilities which will actually turn your team into demons, whom you’ll then use to continue fighting off other demons.
* The game is said to sport real-time online multiplayer for up to six players, either cooperatively or competitively in 3v3 team battles. Other perks to look for: Clans with ranking/rewards system, a lengthy campaign for those who prefer single player missions and lots more.
* Unfortunately, there was no word of an iOS port of Shenmue or Streets of Rage.
* Which of the aforementioned titles are you most looking forward to?
