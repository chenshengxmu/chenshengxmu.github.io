* Bose products disappeared from Apple’s online store in several countries (still in at least the UK Store) this afternoon. The change, first spotted by 9to5Mac, follows rumors that the long-standing retail relationship between the two companies has soured.
* Customers will no longer come across Bose speakers and headphones in device accessory pages on Apple.com, and a search for ‘Bose’ on Apple’s website comes up empty. It’s believed that we will soon start seeing similar removals from Apple’s retail stores.
* The news comes amid a growing rivalry between Beats, now owned by Apple, and Bose. Thanks to its sponsorship deal with the NFL, Bose was able to successfully ban players from wearing Beats headphones while on TV. And then there was the patent suit.
* It would seem, however, that Apple will get the last word. While Bose products are offered by countless other merchants, no one brings in consumers looking to buy premium electronics like Apple stores. I imagine this is going to do more than just sting Bose.
