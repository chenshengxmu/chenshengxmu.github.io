* A few days ago we told you that pod2g and his fellow hackers were getting close to completing an untethered jailbreak for A5 devices. This includes both the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S.
* While we still don’t have an exact release date, pod2g did give us something to wet our appetites. The hacker has just posted a video to his blog of an untethered jailbreak running on Apple’s latest handset…
* The video was shot by Dustin Howett, an iOS developer and member of the Chronic Dev Team. As you can see, he demonstrates a complete, untethered jailbreak on his iPhone 4S.
* Pod2g notes on his blog that there is “only a few to wait now,” so we assume that we are getting extremely close to an A5 jailbreak release. Make sure to keep checking back with iDB, we’ll let you know as soon as it drops.
