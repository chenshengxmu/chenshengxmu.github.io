* If you didn’t get the memo or can’t afford forking $1,599 for this year’s WWDC conference, but are a full- or part-time student over the age of thirteen, Apple’s got you covered. The company said it will offer 150 students a chance to win scholarships for WWDC 2012, which includes a free of charge ticket to all conference sessions.
* The company will judge applicants on “technical ability, creativity of ideas expressed in products or projects, prior WWDC attendance, as well as technical and work experience”. If there is a tie, the most creative applicant has an edge, Apple noted…
* The official WWDC 2012 Scholarship website says scholarship applications are due by Wednesday, May 2, 2012 at 5pm Pacific. The iPhone maker strives to recognize and award some great apps by young developers:
* If you’re a student that’s creating some really cool apps, tell us about yourself. We want to reward outstanding student developers with the opportunity to attend this year’s conference on a WWDC 2012 Student Scholarship.
* Applicants must be full or part-time students age 13 or older and be members of the iOS Developer Program or Mac Developer Program, each costing $99 a year, or the free iOS Developer University Program.
* I know what you’re thinking. Kid devs, right?
* You’d be surprised with how young some of the developers out there really are.
* Take, for example, Thomas Suarez, a sixth grade student at a middle school in the South Bay of Los Angeles who began creating and selling his own work on the App Store shortly after Apple had released the iOS software development kit in February of 2008.
* Here’s a video of Suarez doing a TED talk – turns out he’s also an excellent public speaker, too!
* So, what were you doing in sixth grade?
* I sure as hell wasn’t building apps or doing TED talks…
