* Target may files as the first company to update its iOS app with official support for the Apple Watch, which goes on pre-order on April 10 before hitting store shelves two weeks later.
* Now rolling out in the App Store, Target 7.3.1 for the iPhone will let you build a shopping list on your Apple Watch and includes a Glance to see when your store is open.
* “When you’re in the store, it tells you where to find all of the items you need,” as per release notes.
* Here’s the full changelog (hat tip goes to Matthew Miller and Chase Angelo Giles)
* New in 7.3.1
* Apple Watch
* Make your trip more efficient and even a little more fun. The Target app makes it easy to build a shopping list on your Apple Watch. When you’re in the store, it tells you where to find all of the items you need.
* Target’s app is among the third-party software featured on the App Store Apps section of the Apple Watch micro-site.
* “Make your next trip more efficient and even a little more fun,” writes Apple. “The Target app makes it easy to build a shopping list on your Apple Watch. And when you’re in the store, it tells you where to find the items you need.”

* I think these features capture the essence of Apple’s wearable perfectly.
* This is one of the many typical use cases one could think of when the Watch is more convenient to use than an iPhone. Having my shopping list available to me at all times at a raise of my wrist is so much better than wondering through a store with a 5.5-inch screen in my hand.
* Download Target’s app free in the App Store.
* The 45.3-megabyte iPhone-only app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
