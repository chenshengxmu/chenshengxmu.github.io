* Nike has launched a new iOS app this week called ‘Nike SB.’ The SB stands for skateboard, and the app offers up a number of features for those who love the sport including an interactive trick guide, the ability to share tips and tricks, and more.
* The app also allows users to play one another in S.K.A.T.E., an offshoot of H-O-R-S-E, which pits two players against each other in a trick shootout. When a player fails to replicate a trick, they’re given a letter. And the first to spell “SKATE” loses…
* From the release notes:
* Learn tricks, play games of S.K.A.T.E., take part in challenges with skaters around the planet, and chart your personal skate progress with the Nike SB App.
* – Game of S.K.A.T.E.: Connect with skaters anywhere around the globe to play a game of S.K.A.T.E. through the app. – Challenges: Step up to new challenges issued by Nike SB and our pro team to help you keep progressing. Share your footage and have the chance to get noticed by a worldwide audience. – Trick Tree: Lose yourself in skateboarding’s endless creative process with our extensive Trick Tree, further inspiring you to learn and expand your skills. Learn straight from the pros with never-been-done filming and playback techniques before helping expand the Trick Tree with your own footage. – Badges: Earn special and limited badges for skating hard, meeting challenges, progressing and taking part in special events. – My Progress: Use the Nike SB App to track your own evolution as you build your personal profile. – Need help?

* I’m not a skateboarder myself—I tried when I was younger and could barely go forward, let alone do tricks—but I can imagine this being a lot of fun for those who are. The Trick Tree in particular looks cool, as you can use it to expand on your skills.
* And the best part is, it doesn’t appear to be a gimmick. The app currently has a 4.5 rating on over 100 App Store reviews, and launching the app shows over 30,000 S.K.A.T.E. games being played. To download Nike SB for your iPhone, click here. It’s free.
