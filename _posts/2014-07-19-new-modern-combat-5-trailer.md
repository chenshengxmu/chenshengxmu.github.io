* After more than a year of waiting, Gameloft is finally ready to release Modern Combat 5: Blackout. The studio announced earlier this month that the game will launch for iOS and Android on July 24th, which is next Thursday.
* To hold you over until then, Gameloft has posted an official Launch trailer for MC5. While we’ve seen videos before, this new clip is over a minute long and offers an entertaining look at the game’s graphics and gameplay…
* Modern Combat 5: Blackout will once again take fans on an adventure across the globe, as the player engages in special counter-terrorism operations with the latest and most technologically advanced combat weaponry. The single-player campaign for MC5: Blackout consists of compact and dynamic missions that ratchet up the suspense of each action-packed moments. The development team wanted players to experience the story in a more intense and diverse way than ever before.
* Like fans have seen in some of the earlier demos, the story will indeed begin in Venice, Italy where Phoenix, the main character of the game, is sent on a special operation to secure a transport of WMDs from a particularly well-armed terrorist group. From there the plot will take gamers on a globe-trotting adventure, including a particularly harrowing sequence in Tokyo where Phoenix has to fight amidst total anarchy while trying to convince his allies to accept an uncomfortable secret. By the end, players will have experienced a range of visually-stunning settings, and thrilling action-packed combat sequences. 
* Modern Combat 5 is going to feature a number of improvements over its predecessor including upgraded graphics, a new unified progression system, and a new multiplayer mode that allows you to join squads with your friends.
