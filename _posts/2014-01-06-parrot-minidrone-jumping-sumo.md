* There’s a flurry of app-enabled toys being announced at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show that’s currently underway in Las Vegas, Nevada.
* Cody already told you about Orbotix’s second-generation Sphero 2B and I myself did a quick post on a smart electric toothbrush that wants to game-fy your dental care.
* That’s just scratching the surface as Parrot, the maker of the famous app-controled AR.Drone, has announced an expansion of its product lineup with two new gadgets, the MiniDrone and Jumping Sumo. Read on for the full reveal…
* The MiniDrone is a miniaturized version of the AR.Drone – it fits in the palm of your hand – that talks to your iOS or Android smartphone or a tablet using power-eficient Bluetooth 4.0 technology.
* It flies and rolls from floor to ceiling, but unfortunately won’t record anything because there’s no on-board cameras. But hey, the wheels are removable!

* The Jumping Sumo, pitched as the first robot-insect, is controlled in via dual-band 5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking which allows for much greater distances compared to Bluetooth.
* By comparison, the MiniDrone’s Bluetooth allows for a maximum range in clear air of about 160 feet. As the name implies, the Sumo jumps up to 80 cm and takes 90-degree turns.
* Check out the promo vid.
* Yes, the Sumo has a front-facing QVGA camera so you can remotely spy on your pets.
* According to The Verge, the MiniDrone incorporates an accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope and downwards-facing camera to give the drone all it needs to stay aloft.
* Again, there’s no usable camera on board and no video output.
* Both toys have nice headlights and LEDs.
* Release date and pricing is yet to be announced.
