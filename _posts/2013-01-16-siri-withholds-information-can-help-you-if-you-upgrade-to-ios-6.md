* We haven’t seen a publicly released untethered jailbreak since iOS 6 debuted in September, and Apple hasn’t been making the wait easy for the jailbreak community. There are the little annoyances, like apps exclusive to iOS 6, over the air update alerts, and that pesky notification badge in settings that appears by default. Some of these are easy to deal with through tweaks, but what happens when Apple isn’t being subtle?
* A user on Reddit asked Siri when the superbowl was starting, only to find that his personal assistant refused to comply. Siri’s response: “If you update to the latest version of iOS, I’ll be able to help you with that.” …

* iOS 6 has enhanced support for baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer.
* To be fair to Apple, iOS 6 includes tons of sports information from the NFL and other sports leagues, all accessible through Siri, in addition to other features and enhancements. Siri in iOS 6 is without a doubt ‘smarter’ when it comes to answering questions on a number of questions than Siri in iOS 5.1.1.
* The issue here is the outdated version of Siri was able to answer questions like “When is the Super Bowl?” with an internet search in the past. The refusal to answer the question apparently cropped up sometime in the last month. If you’re staying on an older version of iOS, for whatever reason, Apple seems to have made the old version of Siri more difficult to use.
* I’m on an iPhone 4 and I haven’t bothered with any Siri ports, so I haven’t encountered this issue firsthand, but it was reported by two separate users.
* Does Siri refuse to do any searches for you in iOS 5? Feel free to share examples and workarounds in the comments section.
