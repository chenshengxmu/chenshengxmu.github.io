* Apple has released a plethora updates on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the company has revamped its web-based iWork for iCloud suite and then followed up by half a dozen matching updates to Pages, Keynote and Numbers for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices and Mac computers.
* Available now through your Mac’s Software Update mechanism, the new Safari 7.0.3 update brings a bunch of bug fixes and a few noteworthy security-related enhancements like the strengthened Safari sandboxing, improved credit card autofill compatibility with websites and more…
* On top of the aforementioned improvements, this version of Safari includes support for webpages with generic top-level domains and fixes an issue with push notifications when new content became available on certain websites while adding a preference setting to turn off push notification prompts altogether.
* If you don’t need notifications from websites, simply untick the new ‘Allow websites to ask for permission to send push notifications’ box at the bottom of the Notifications pane in Safari’s Preferences.
