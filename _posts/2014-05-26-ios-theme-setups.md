* A few of our readers have asked us what happened to Theme Thursday, a weekly column that covered the best new Winterboard themes for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The answer is that we decided to discontinue this column in April, primarily because themes started being released on a less frequent basis. Nevertheless, the theming community is still going strong.
* Despite the slowdown, there are still a number of quality themes released every now and then that are worth mentioning. As such, we’ve turned to the /r/iOSthemes community on Reddit and hand picked three iOS theme setups that we think look gorgeous. Where possible, we’ve included the themes and jailbreak tweaks used to achieve each setup. Take a look ahead…

* Reddit user Bieberkinz has posted a summer setup with a clean looking weather widget on the Lock screen, Android style clock widget on the Home screen, simplistic glyph icons and a white status bar. To achieve the Lock screen, a Cydget called MIUI was used. It can be downloaded from this Dropbox file and manually installed using a program like iFunBox. The circular slide to unlock is a tweak called JellyLock7 with a MIUI Jelly7ock skin. Here is the wallpaper used.
* The icons are themed with Clarity and shrunk in size with a tweak called Bigify. Homescreen Designer was used to achieve the 5 × 4 icon layout, and No Icon Labels and White StatusBar (Flex 2) were used to remove icon labels and set a white status bar. Folder Customizer and TinyGrid were used to modify the folders, DockShift was used to customize the dock and the clock used is the Roliz Clock iWidget. The status bar also uses Android KitKat Status Bar, Cloaky and Zeppelin.

* If the last setup was a summer theme, then this one is probably as much the opposite as you can get. Reddit user iFaRtRaINb0WZzz customized his Lock screen with the iW RM2 Sch clock widget, which can be downloaded from Mediafire and applied manually using iFunBox, iExplorer or similar. He says that everything else was hidden using the LockHTML3 tweak on Cydia.
* The icon theme for the Home screen is Mandalino and the clock is achieved with an iWidget called Easy Time. The icons were stripped of labels and custom positioned using Bigify and Iconoclasm respectively. The page dots were removed with the tweak NoPageDots7. The wallpaper used is included at the bottom of this Imgur album. The status bar uses Ayeris, Radar Wi-Fi Bars and Alkaline with a Spots theme.

* For his subtle setup, Reddit user Xcecutive is using the Lock screen extension Convergance that is customized with the AnotherTheme LS theme set to the 24 hour version. A systemwide tint is applied using the tweak Unitint, which requires adding the repository chewitt.me/repo to your Cydia sources. In terms of the Home screen, it is based off an iWidget that the setup creator hopes to release in the coming weeks. Here are the two wallpapers used on the Lock and Home screens.
* While not shown, the tweak Color Keyboard is also used with this custom background. Stride 2 allows for a blurred passcode, and the system user interface is based off Loop. The custom icons used are STYLZZ by designer In2ition, which can be downloaded from Dropbox and applied manually using iFunBox or similar. The bottom widget on the Home screen is custom, modified by the user that posted this setup.
* Most of the iOS theme setups above are much more complex than what is shown here. I recommend clicking on the source link for each theme to see its setup in full detail, as a lot of users have customized smaller elements like Control Center, Notification Center and certain apps. I also encourage everyone to share their own iOS setups in the comments below. We might promote some of the best setups in a future post.
