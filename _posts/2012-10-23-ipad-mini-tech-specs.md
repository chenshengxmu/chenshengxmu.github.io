* Now that we know all about the new iPad mini, its features, and its price tag, it’s time to take a look at the technical specifications of the tablet. How is it going to measure up to Apple’s other devices performance-wise?
* Phil Schiller breezed over this a bit on stage, saying that the iPad mini was equal to or better than the iPad 2 in almost every way. And to prove it, Apple’s just posted a full list of iPad mini tech specs on its website…
* The iPad mini’s tag line is “every inch an iPad,” meaning that while its smaller dimensions are its biggest selling point, it’s still an iPad. That being said, this thing is extremely light, and as expected, almost iPod touch-thin.
* To be fair, Apple notes that the Wi-Fi + cellular model is .01 pounds heavier, weighing in at 0.69 (or 312 g).
* Like its full-sized sibling, the iPad mini will come in both Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + cellular options. The latter comes in two models, with LTE chips that will work on Long Term Evolutionary 4G networks around the world.
* Model A1454
* Model A1455
* Here in the US, the Wi-Fi + cellular model will be offered by AT&T, Verizon and (drumroll please) Sprint!
* Unfortunately, the rumors were true. The iPad mini does not sport one of Apple’s crisp new Retina displays. In fact, the panel’s resolution matches that of the nearly two year-old iPad 2 at 1024 x 768.
* It’s worth pointing out that the pixels per inch count is higher on the iPad mini than it is on the iPad 2. So the display should still be fairly sharp.
* Not much to see here actually. The iPad mini utilizes Apple’s dual-core A5 processor, which is not necessarily a bad thing given how long it’s been making them. It certainly has the formula down pat by now.
* Presumably, this is the newer one from the retooled iPad 2 that is smaller and more power efficient.
* Yes, the iPad mini has both a front and rear-facing camera. And they’re actually both pretty stout. The FaceTime camera has the new HD sensor from the iPhone 5, and the iSight camera is of the 5MP variety.
* FaceTime HD camera:
* iSight camera:
* There doesn’t seem to be an LED flash on the mini. Which is ok, really, because… it’s a tablet.
* The iPad mini features the same 10-hour battery life of its older siblings. Here’s the specs for the Wi-Fi only model:
* And for the + cellular option:
* Admittedly, 10 hour battery life is impressive for an LTE tablet. Especially considering how thin the mini is.
* That’s about it for the iPad mini tech specs. There’s a lot of standard stuff we didn’t mention like a 3.5mm audio jack, and built-in compass and accelerometer. And yes, for those wondering, it does have an ambient light sensor. If you’re really interested in the particulars, you can see the full list over on Apple’s website.
* To be honest, I didn’t see anything in the spec list that warranted the higher price tag, though I’m fairly certain the size of the tablet had more to do with it. But it’ll be interesting to see if consumers find the tablet’s thinner and lighter casing to be worth the $130 premium over the competition. Or just $70 less than an iPad 2.
* What do you think of the iPad mini thus far?
