* Spotify, arguably the most popular subscription-based music streaming service, on Monday refreshed its free iOS client with a few improvements.
* In addition to adding Finnish language support that recently appeared in Spotify’s Android client, the updated software now makes it possible to save albums to Your Music, from any album page. Moreover, you can now easily check out album release dates and total play time, too.
* To save a whole album to Your Music, hit the new Save button (see below) on the album page. And to access additional information like release year and total play time, simply swipe an album’s header.
