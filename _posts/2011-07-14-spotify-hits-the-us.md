* Spotify, the popular music streaming service, has finally hit the US. We reported last week of its imminent launch, and now the wait is over, but, unfortunately, there is a catch. If you had signed up last week, you are going to receive an invite to join Spotify. If you haven’t, the only way for you to start using their service right away is to subscribe to one of their paid plans.
* They are not expensive, starting at $4.99 for the Unlimited package, which lets you stream unlimited music, and $9.99 for the Premium package, which allows you to stream to your mobile and offers an offline mode as well. Refer to this page for more accurate info…
* Moreover, the Spotify app for iOS is now available in the App Store. It’s free, but you won’t be able to use it unless you subscribe to their Premium package.
* The free version of Spotify is a great way to discover new tracks and to listen to music in general. But if you are a heavy listener, it’s probably a good idea you spend money on it to enjoy the full experience Spotify can offer.
* Have you tried it yet? What do you think?
