* It seems like we’ve been waiting a while to hear back from Saurik about his progress on official iOS 11 support for Cydia and Substrate, but meanwhile, many developers are producing tweaks that work on devices jailbroken with CoolStar’s Electra tool.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks released throughout the past week. As always, we’ll kick things off by talking about our favorites and then outline the rest of the releases afterward.

* Aerify is a well-designed volume HUD replacement for iOS that feels less-intrusive. It does away with the stock middle-of-screen HUD and moves it to the Status Bar instead, as shown above.
* The Aerify slider color can be customized to your liking from the tweak’s dedicated preference pane.
* You can learn more about Aerify and why it’s one of the best volume HUD replacements for iOS in our full review. You can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.

* The app bar in the iOS 11 Messages app appears whether you take advantage of iMessage extensions or not, and it can make the app feel more cluttered than some people want it to be.
* Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called NoMoreAppBar can do away with it, once and for all. You can see the before and after images above.
* If you’d like to learn more about NoMoreAppBar, then we’d recommend reading our full review. You can download the tweak for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.

* PinchToCloseFolders is a subtle new jailbreak tweak that, as the name implies, allows you to pinch your Home screen folders closed.
* The new pinch gesture replaces either tapping somewhere outside of the folder or pressing the Home button while you’re inside of one. The gesture may feel a bit more cumbersome to some, but it’s a great way to take advantage of your multi-touch display and keep the gesture consistent with the stock folder-closing animations.
* You can learn more about PinchToCloseFolders and why you might want it in our full review. You can download the tweak for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
