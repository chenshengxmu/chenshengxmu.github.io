* In a class action lawsuit filed in San Jose, California last week, Florida resident Debra Hilton claims that Apple was aware of a flaw in the flex cable that controls the power button on the iPhone 4, but chose to stay quiet about it to sell more handsets.
* Hilton is seeking more than $5 million in damages from the Cupertino company on behalf of thousands of iPhone 4 owners she believes bought devices with defective power buttons. Allegedly, Apple knew about the issue, but did nothing to fix it…
* GigaOm points us to the lawsuit, which looks like it was filed on May 10 under the RICO (Racketeer influenced and Corrupt Organizations) act. The site explains that this is a federal racketeering law that has become a popular route for class action suits.
* In the filing, Hilton highlights a thread in Apple’s support forums, which is nearing a million views, as evidence to the issue. In the thread, users complained of ‘wiggly’ power buttons on their iPhone 4 handsets that would neither lock, nor power down.
* The issue seems to, more often than not, pop up after the device is well past a year old, meaning that folks without AppleCare plans are left out of warranty. And judging by the comments, it’s an expensive problem to fix—most reported paying $150 in repairs.
* It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. Apple just started mailing out checks to plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit over antennagate. And it also recently reached a pricey ($53 million) settlement in another suit over its iPhone/iPod touch warranties.
