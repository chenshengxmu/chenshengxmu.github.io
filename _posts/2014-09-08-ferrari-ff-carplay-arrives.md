* Ferrari on Monday started delivering its new Ferrari FF model with CarPlay integration to early adopters, becoming the first commercially available vehicle on the roads with native support for Apple’s in-car system, previously known as ‘iOS in the Car’. CarPlay is also available for older vehicles as an aftermarket solution from the likes of Alpine and Pioneer.
* The $300,000 sports car with a 6.3-liter V12 engine provides a cool 651 horsepower and takes you from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 second (top speed: 208 miles per hour). CarPlay integration in the Ferrari FF includes the familiar features like voice-guided navigation, Siri, music playback, voice controls, messaging, phone calls and more.
* According to the Italian car maker, first Ferrari FF vehicles are now being delivered to happy customers in Germany, Great Britain, France and Switzerland while others have been dispatched to the United States and Japan.

* Though it’s taken a while, it’s good that first CarPlay-enabled vehicles have finally started rolling off the assembly lines. Given that Ferraris and Maseratis have terrible infotainment systems, CarPlay is going to be a huge improvement for fans of the brand.

* CarPlay is also available for the Ferrari California T, the mid-front-engined V8 Turbo unveiled at the last Geneva Motor Show.
* Pitched as “the smarter, safer and fun way to use iPhone in your car,” CarPlay requires an iPhone 5/5s/5c with iOS 7.1 or later. CarPlay backers include Volvo, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Chrysler Fiat, Mazda, Audi and many others.
