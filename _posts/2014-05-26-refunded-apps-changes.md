* If you’ve ever asked for a refund on a Mac, iPhone, iPod touch or iPad app you purchased in the Mac App Store or the App Store, Apple somewhat unexpectedly did allow you to update your existing installations – even reinstall previously refunded apps.
* That’s no longer the case. According to multiple reports, users who try to update or reinstall refunded iOS and OS X applications are now greeted with a prompt informing them that Apple no longer supports the practice…
* Six days ago, iDownloadBlog reader from Saudi Arabia tipped me about this on Twitter, as evidenced by the screenshot top of post.
* Attempting to redownload refunded apps yields the ‘update unavailable with this Apple ID’ prompt:
* This update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.
* This has been later confirmed by Fantastical developer Michael Simmons who tweeted out a similar screenshot this weekend, as seen below.

* Mathew Schaffer confirms this is the case with the Mac App Store apps,
* “I noticed this on the Mac App Store this week, as well,” he wrote on Twitter.
* Several people cautioned that Apple hasn’t been allowing reinstalls of refunded apps for quite a while.
* If true, then what’s new here is the prompt itself.
* I think this is quite reasonable.
* I can’t recall any digital retailer that would let folks continue to use, update and even redownload previously refunded content.
* Although some will squawk about this, it makes perfect sense from developers’ standpoint to close the loophole for dishonest types used to game the system by purchasing an app, getting a refund and keeping the software.
* That’s borderline stealing.

* Out of curiosity, have you ever asked for a refund on an iOS app? If so, what was your experience like? Also, can anyone confirm being able to re-purchase a refunded app?
* I’m getting reports that this isn’t possible, which especially sucks when a previously paid app goes free, like Tweetbot. Oddly enough, Apple apparently won’t let you download or even repurchase previously refunded apps.
