* No surprise here. It appears that Apple has just pulled iMAME, the arcade game emulator we told you about a few days ago, shortly after it surfaced in the App Store.
* Judging by Apple’s history with controversial apps, we figured it was only a matter of time before Apple removed it. Especially since iMAME can play illegally-downloaded arcade games…
* Once again, there doesn’t appear to be any method to Apple’s madness. If iMAME was bad enough to pull from the App Store, why did it ever approve the application in the first place?
* Regardless, what’s done is done, and there are plenty of other emulator apps available in both the App Store and Cydia. If you managed to grab iMAME before Apple pulled it, be sure to check out our step-by-step tutorial on how to add games.
