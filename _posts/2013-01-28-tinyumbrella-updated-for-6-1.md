* With a new jailbreak impending, it’s nice to see that notcom has updated his SHSH blob-saving utility this afternoon. TinyUmbrella now supports the newly-released iOS 6.1 firmware, as well as iOS 6.0.2.
* The developer also says that he is still hard at work on a TU revamp, which will include auto-updating and “much cleaner code.”
* Here’s the announcement from the TU blog:
* “6.0.2 and 6.1 support for all relevant devices has been added. Sorry for the delay. I’m still working on the rewrite that will include auto updating and much cleaner code. I’ll post more details as I get closer to completion. I have a feeling I’ll be making at least some of the modules open source on either github or bitbucket.
* You’ll want to make sure that you save your SHSH blobs when you get to iOS 6.1. Hackers waited for it to release their jailbreak to avoid Apple catching their exploits. And though the plan worked, it could easily release a quick update to patch the holes.
* As always, you can find the latest version of TinyUmbrella on our Downloads page. And if you want to know more about getting ready for the iOS 6.1 jailbreak, check out our awesome preparation guide.
* Update: For those of you having problems with TinyUmbrella, notcom says he has issued a minor update to fix them. You can find it using the same link shown above.
