* The public jailbreak for iOS 10 is still nowhere to be found, but Cydia developers are still launching creative tweaks that can make your jailbroken iOS 9 device(s) cooler than ever.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about this week’s jailbreak tweak releases, starting with our favorites and then outlining everything else afterwards.

* Dejavu does away with the problem of adding duplicate songs to playlists in your Apple Music app.
* It’ll gray out songs that have previously been added to the playlist you’re trying to add music to, and as a result, you won’t have duplicate songs in your Apple Music playlists anymore.
* This is a functional tweak intended to improve the way the Music app works, and because duplicate songs in my playlists bother me, I’m sure it bothers some other people as well and this tweak is the ultimate fix.
* You can read our full review of Dejavu to find out more about its features and how to get it.
* NoATWAKEUP: Is said to improve battery life by disabling an unnecessary launch daemon (free – review)
* Spotty: Adds album art to the Spotify playlist view (free – review)
* That wraps it up for this roundup, but there are sure to be some new tweaks in the pipeline for next week. Stay tuned to iDB for the latest jailbreak news so you’re prepared for an iOS 10 jailbreak, should one ever drop.
