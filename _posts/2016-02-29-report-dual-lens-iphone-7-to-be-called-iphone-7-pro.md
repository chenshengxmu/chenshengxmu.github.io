* My Drivers, a Chinese website that covers IT industry, is reporting today that Apple’s next smartphone refresh will come with a tweaked naming scheme. A high-end iPhone 7 Plus model with dual cameras will be reportedly getting a ‘Pro’ moniker in order to better distinguish itself from the regular iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models.
* Apple’s product naming scheme is currently all over the place.
* The upcoming four-inch iPhone, for example, is said to be marketed as ‘iPhone SE,’ marking the first iPhone upgrade without a number in its name. And, of course, we now have the iPad Pro, in addition to the iPad Air and iPad mini lineups.
* If Apple sticks to its annual refresh cycle, the iPhone 7 (can you believe we’ve burned through nine iPhone iterations already?) is going to be released in September. We’re still seven months away from the big day, but leaks and numerous rumors have been swirling around for some time now.
* Earlier today, French blog NowhereElse.fr published a set of images that purportedly show off an iPhone 7 frame, but a closer inspection suggests that part was likely designed for a Huawei device because there’s a hole for the headphone jack at the bottom and the display assembly frame measures 5.2 inches diagonally.
* In addition to losing the headphone jack in favor of Lightning-based and wireless headsets, a 5.5-inch version of Apple’s next iPhone is rumored to arrive in two flavors: the regular version and a high-end one with dual cameras.
* If true, that would make for three iPhones this fall: an entry-level iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch screen, an iPhone 7 Plus with a 5.5-inch display and an even pricier iPhone 7 Pro with certain exclusive features, like the dual-lens camera.
* Does that make sense to you?
