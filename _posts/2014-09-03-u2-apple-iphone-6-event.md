* Some interesting rumors began bouncing around the tech world earlier today regarding popular Irish rock band U2 and Apple’s big media event next week. The chatter has ranged from the iPhone 6 coming preloaded with the band’s new album, to it performing live after the keynote.
* Much of the speculation seems to stem from U2’s secret video shoot in Dublin last week. According to The Sunday Times, the group closed down Samuel Beckett Bridge for the recording and placed black sheets around the set to prevent the public from seeing what they were shooting.
* Music promotor Stephen Browne managed to snap a photo of the shoot, which he posted to Twitter today saying “the focus of the “video” on the bridge last week was a phone.” He suggests the iPhone 6 may come preloaded with U2’s new album, something MacRumors has also been told.
* Adding to all of this is CNET’s Shara Tibken, who says she’s hearing that U2 frontman Bono may turn up at the iPhone event as a surprise musical guest. That could explain the large 2-story structure Apple is building next to the Flint Center, which many have said resembles a concert stage.
* Obviously, all of this is speculation at this point, but I don’t think it would surprise anyone if U2 showed up at next Tuesday’s event. Apple has a long history with the band, which includes collaborations on everything from iPods, to fundraising for Bono’s high profile Product Red charity.
