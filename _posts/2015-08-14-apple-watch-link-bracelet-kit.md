* After launching its wearable device earlier this morning through Best Buy Canada and the Australian department store Harvey Norman’s outlets in Auburn, New South Wales, Apple surprised Apple Watch fans by making available a few new accessories on its online store.
* An all-new Link Bracelet Kit and L/XL Sports Bands to fit bigger wrists are now available through the Apple Online Store.
* In addition, the 38mm Modern Buckle band is now available on a standalone basis for the first time since the Apple Watch’s April debut.
* The Link Bracelet Kit gives you six additional links to extend your 42mm stainless steel Link Bracelet by an additional 40mm, which should prove useful for wrists that exceed 205mm.
* The regular Link Bracelet is designed for wrists up to 205mm so people with wrists up to 245mm will want to purchase the Link Bracelet Kit. These links have the release button on them so you can add and remove them without any special tools.

* Apple ensures that the Link Bracelet Kit, which costs $49 a pop, is crafted “from the same stainless steel alloy as the case and the Link Bracelet.” It’s available in Silver but not in Space Black, with shipping times between five and seven business days.
* Buy the $49 Link Bracelet Kit via the Apple Online Store.
* Sport Bands for 42mm Apple Watches are now available in two new sizes: Large (L) and Extra Large (XL). The 42mm Apple Watch Sport includes the Sport Band configurable for either S/M or M/L length to fit 135mm-215mm wrists so the new L/XL sizing option will appeal to customers with bigger wrists.

* Available in black and white color options, the new L & XL option expands the size range of the band to 245mm to fit 160-245mm wrists and includes strap which can be configured for either M/L or L/XL length.
* All told, customers can now buy Sport Bands for 42mm Apple Watches in two different sizing configurations: S/M & M/L and M/L & L/XL. The new bands ship out in 5-7 business days.
* Buy the $49 42mm L/XL Sport Band via the Apple Online Store.
* Last but not least, the 38mm Modern Buckle band can now be purchased separately from the watch itself, marking the first time it’s offered as a standalone purchase following the Apple Watch’s April 24 launch.
* The $249 Modern Buckle comes in three sizes—Small (135–150mm), Medium (145–165mm) and Large (160–180mm)—and four color choices: Brown, Black, Pink and Blue.

* Crafted from the Granada leather which originates from a single small tannery in France established in 1803, the Modern Buckle incorporates “the smooth top-grain leather” that is “lightly milled and tumbled to maintain its refined texture.”
* An inner layer of Vectran weave is added for strength and stretch resistance, the same material “NASA used to make the landing airbags for the Mars Rover spacecraft.”
* Orders placed today will be delivered between August 24 – 31. The in-store pickup option was unavailable at post time.
* Buy the $249 Modern Buckle Band via the Apple Online Store.
* An updated sizing guide for Apple Watch bands is available here.
