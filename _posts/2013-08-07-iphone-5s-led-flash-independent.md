* The not-entirely-accurate Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes back in June 2011 incorrectly reported that the then rumored iPhone 5 would incorporate dual-LED flash. That hasn’t panned out, but the rumor lives on. Numerous reports and a purported backplate seemingly point to Apple adopting dual-LED flash on the iPhone 5S.
* But unlike the standard implementations, Apple engineers may have chosen to incorporate the LED flash module completely independent from the camera lens, potentially reducing interference with the camera module…
* The French blog NowhereElse.fr passes along images posted by a Chinese retailer Luna Commerce that show some differences between the standard iPhone 5S camera module and the rumored iPhone 5S camera with dual-LED flash.

* Shown above is the alleged iPhone 5S camera module.
* You can clearly see a standalone camera attached to a ribbon, as opposed to the current iPhone 5 which has a ribbon attached to the part.
* As noted by iPhone in Canada, the image appears to confirm the dual-LED flash rumor “as the connectors could differ”. It also all but confirms that the iPhone 5S ‘s camera module could be indeed totally independent of the flash.

* Take this with a grain of salt as Luna Commerce could be in it purely for free press.
* The next iPhone is said to improve upon the iPhone 5’s eight-megapixel camera with sapphire lens by introducing a twelve or thirteen-megapixel module, perhaps featuring Sony’s sensor.
* There’s more to photography than the pixels. With that in mind, the increased resolution of the next iPhone’s camera will undoubtedly provide a nice boon to iPhone photography buffs out there.
* Case in point: this image Brian Klug, Senior Smartphone Editor for AnandTech, took with his Moto X.

* Awesome, no?
* Moto X’s ten-megapixel ClearPixel camera has excellent low-ligh performance, so much so that some say it outperforms Nokia’s Lumia 1020 PureView 41MP snapper.
* Dual-LED flash – a photography feature found on some high-end Android smartphones – provides brighter and more expansive lighting, which allows for better low-light images.
* A stronger burst of light should also make a difference when you access flashlight from the iOS 7 Control Center or enable LED flash alerts in iOS.
* Who’s excited about dual-LED flash on the iPhone 5S?
