* Remember Auxo, the jailbreak tweak that reinvigorates iOS’ app switcher? You’re probably thinking to yourself, ‘Jeff, how can I forget?’ Well, the team behind Auxo promised that their tweak would be themeable, and while we didn’t see any themes to coincide with its release, theme designers are begining to publish their work to Cydia.
* One of the first Auxo themes available on Cydia is Auxo Glasklart. Like most themes, it uses WinterBoard as a framework. How do Auxo themes function and feel? Take a look inside as we take Auxo Glasklart for a ride…
* Pretty much everything about Auxo can be changed via a theme, although the few that I tried focused primarily on theming Auxo’s toggles. Most of the Auxo themes that you’ll find on Cydia are add-ons to existing themes. For instance, Auxo Glasklart is a compliment for those running both Auxo, and the uber-popular Glasklart theme from Max Rudberg. Think of it as a compliment to flesh out the entire theming experience.
* Whether or not we’ll see more individual themes that aren’t necessarily a part of a bigger package remains to be seen. Personally, I’m quite happy with the way Auxo looks on its own. What about you?
