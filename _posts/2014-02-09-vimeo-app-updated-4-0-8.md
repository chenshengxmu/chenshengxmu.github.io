* Vimeo users will notice that the video-sharing site pushed out an update for its iOS client this weekend, bringing the app to version 4.0.8. The update includes enhancements such as new gestures, deeper AirDrop integration and more.
* As far as the new gestures go, you can now swipe left or right on a video thumbnail to share it, like it, or watch it later, or add it to your device. And with the improved AirDrop support, you can quickly share videos from device to device…
* Here are the release notes for version 4.0.8:
* What’s New in Version 4.0.8
* Gesticulation nation: Swipe left or right on a thumbnail to Share, Like, Watch Later, or Add to Device.
* Sharing is caring: Share any video through Airdrop; see more videos from Twitter and Facebook friends in your Incoming feed.
* Better everywhere: We fixed some bugs and made playback and search speedier, easier, and cooler.
* Patience, Grasshopper: Like all apps, this one is a work in progress. We’re striving to make it as awesome as we know it can be by adding features with every release. Thanks for understanding!
* Interestingly enough, Vimeo added AirDrop sharing to the app back in November, but in the change log it notes that the feature can now be used to share any video. So we’re guessing that it has been improved in some form or another.
* And that’s really been Vimeo’s M.O. with its iOS app lately. It’s recently gotten into the habit of seeding updates about once every month or so, revamping features like search and making it easier for users to discover and share videos.
* If you use the service in any capacity, posting or viewing, you should check it out. The Vimeo app is available in the App Store for free.
