* Apple will begin conducting in-store screen repairs for the iPhone 5c next week, according to a report from 9to5Mac. The site says that under the new practice, the company will be able to repair most displays ‘within the hour.’
* This means that Apple Stores will no longer have to replace an entire device due to a cracked screen. And the initiative will not only help Apple save money on repairs, but it’ll also save users from having to setup new devices…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has more details:
* “Apple has begun conducting iPhone 5c screen replacements in a small number of stores in the United States over the past couple of months, but the January 20th rollout will represent a full-scale launch in all of Apple’s retail regions aside from Hong Kong and Canada.”
* Gurman says that broken displays that aren’t covered under warranty will likely cost $149 per device to repair. For phones that do have AppleCare, it seems probable Apple will charge $75 per device like it does with the iPhone 5.

* It doesn’t look like the iPhone 5s is going to join the 5c in next week’s rollout, but Apple still plans to offer on-site screen repairs for the popular handset in the near future.
