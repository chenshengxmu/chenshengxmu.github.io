* Yesterday we told you Apple confirmed that 8am on March 16th was the official launch date and time of the new iPad. But it appears that other retailers are looking to get a head start.
* The folks over at Insanely Great Mac are reporting that some Walmart stores are planning to start selling Apple’s new tablet as early as 12:01 am (local time) tomorrow morning…
* “If you want to be the first person amongst your friends and colleagues to have the new ipad, you will need to head to your local Walmart. Starting at 12:01 a.m. local time on March 16, a limited supply of new iPad will be available at your local 24-hour Walmart. Other retailers’ doors don’t open until 8 a.m. local time, so you can get to work on time and beat the rush by coming to Walmart.”
* We were able to confirm with multiple locations that they are indeed starting iPad sales just after midnight.
* On the plus side, lines at Walmart may not be as bad as they look to be at Apple Stores. But chances are they won’t have anywhere near the inventory either. Last year, our local Walmart only had a handful of units available.
* Will you be trying to score an iPad tonight?
