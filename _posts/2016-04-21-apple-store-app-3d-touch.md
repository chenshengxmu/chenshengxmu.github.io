* Apple on Thursday pushed out an update for its Apple Store iOS client, bringing the app to version 3.7. The update brings about new 3D Touch features on compatible devices, and makes the app available in new countries.
* As for 3D Touch support, iPhone 6s users have long been able to utilize Quick Actions on the app icon, but now the Apple Store app supports Peek and Pop. So force-pressing on a link within the app now opens up previews.
* Today’s update also includes support for 3 new countries, where the Apple Store app was previously unavailable: Korea, Russia, and Thailand. Users in these countries should now be able to download it from their App Stores.
* The Apple Store app is available for free.
