title: Poll- What Will Apple Say About the iPhone 4 Antenna Issue At Tomorrows Event?
---
* In case you didn’t know, Apple is having a press conference tomorrow, presumably to address the iPhone 4 antenna fiasco. Will the company come clean and recognize its errors? Will they offer to fix it? Or will they keep pretending there is no problem with the antenna?
* Personally, I think they will offer free Bumpers to everyone. Software can’t fix hardware issues and a recall would cost way too much. The only option left is the free Bumper which will not really address the issue, but at least it will hide the problem – in a rubber case – while being very cost-effective.
* What do you think? Please take this poll and make sure you leave a comment to tell us what you think is going to happen.
