* iOS 4.0.2 is out and available for download. As expected, this update fixes the security hole that was uncovered by JailbreakMe. If you rely on your jailbreak/unlock, you should not update until a new jailbreak has been found.
* You can find all the download links for every iPhone model in our iPhone downloads section.
