* Southwest Airlines posted an update for its official iOS client last night, bringing the app to version 2.4. The update includes a handful of improvements, such as faster access to tools like Checkin and Mobile Boarding Pass options.
* Speaking of mobile boarding passes, the 2.4 update also adds support for the popular feature to a total of 28 airports. Previously, Southwest’s mobile boarding passes could only be used in Austin, but now they’re available nationwide…
* Here’s your full 2.4 change log:
* What’s New in Version 2.4.0
* We’re excited to bring more LUV to the tips of your fingers with version 2.4. In this update we’ve added: • Mobile Boarding Pass in 28 airports: ABQ, ATL, AUS, BWI, BNA, BUR, DAL, DEN, FLL, HOU, LAS, LAX, MCI, MCO, MDW, MKE, MSY, OAK, PHL, PHX, RSW, SAN, SFO, SJC, SMF, SNA, STL, TPA. • NEW upcoming trip cards on your homepage so you can quickly view the info that matters to you the most while traveling like Flight Status, Boarding Position, and Gate Information. • Ability to access our most popular tools like Checkin and your Mobile Boarding Pass options right from the home screen. • Additional bug fixes and improvements.
* For those unfamiliar with the feature, mobile boarding passes are electronic documents—typically in QR form—that enable you to pass through airport security and board your aircraft by letting staff members scan your mobile phone.
