* The big news last week was of course the new iPad and Apple TV launches. For that reason, we supplemented our normal deluge of jailbreak videos with some iPad and Apple TV unboxings, comparisons, and the like. But that’s not to say that there weren’t some striking jailbreak videos created last week, because there were.
* Please be sure to share our iPhone, iPad, and iOS video guides by spreading our posts on Twitter and Facebook.
