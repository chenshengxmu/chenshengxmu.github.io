* BigBoss has pushed an update to the semitethered jailbreak that brings multiple bug fixes and speed improvements. Version 0.7.9 of SemiTether is available in Cydia now for folks on iOS 5 that have jailbroken with a tool like RedSn0w.
* The SemiTether jailbreak is being improved to make it a more viable contender to a full untethered jailbreak. BigBoss is working with saurik to improve his jailbreak alongside a mobile substrate Cydia update.
* Change log:
* BigBoss also notes:
* “Saurik is working on an update to mobile substrate that will solve many of the issues with the semi-tether package. Hopefully this will be out in a day or two. At this time, we can finalize beta testing. I plan to hold further updates until after Saurik has released his mobile substrate update. Saurik’s updates will eliminate the need for the long 90 second respring on boot also.
* This update was only tested on iphone 4. After saurik’s mobile substrate changes, more devices will be tested. Next updates coming in next 2-3 days.”
* Once you perform a tethered jailbreak on a compatible iOS 5 device with RedSn0w, you can install the SemiTether package from the BigBoss repo in Cydia. A semitethered jailbreak functions almost exactly like an untethered jailbreak, except that you can only use certain stock iOS apps after a reboot until you connect your iDevice to a computer and execute a tethered jailbreak again.
* If you’re confused about the difference between a tethered, untethered, and semitethered jailbreak, we explain it all here.
* Here’s our video tutorial on how to install SemiTether:
* Let us know what you notice in this update to SemiTether. Has the reboot time been improved significantly? Have you noticed any other improvements?
