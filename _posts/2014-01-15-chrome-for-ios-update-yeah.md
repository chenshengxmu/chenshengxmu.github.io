* Google announced an update for its mobile Chrome browser today, which will bring the app to version 32. The update brings about a handful of new features including data compression, Google’s popular Translate feature and more.
* The search giant says that the new data compression feature can reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web on your device, using Chrome. And with Google Translate for iOS, you can translate full webpages on the go…
* From the Google Chrome Blog:
* “To start saving data and turn on an even more secure browsing experience, visit “Settings” > “Bandwidth management” > “Reduce data usage.” Then simply turn the toggle to “On.” From this menu, you’ll also be able to track how much bandwidth you save each month as you browse on Chrome.”
* Parlez-vous français? Not to worry. We heard your requests and will be introducing Google Translate in Chrome for iOS in the coming days. With this update, you can now translate webpages in Chrome with the click of a button on your iPhone and iPad, just as you’re used to on Chrome for desktop and Android. To translate a page into your phone or tablet’s native language, just look for the translation bar and select “Translate.”
* Google says that the update will be rolling out to iOS devices “over the next few days.” We’re not seeing yet, but as usual you can find the latest version of Google’s Chrome browser in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
