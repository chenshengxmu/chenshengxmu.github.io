* I’m a technology news junky. From Apple rumors to new gadgets, I just can’t get enough. But there are so many websites that pump out information, how do you keep track of it all?
* Well it’s no secret around iDB that I am a Pulse Mini fan. As far as RSS readers go, it’s amazing. Everything is graphic oriented, so no more sifting through lines and lines of RSS text feeds. Now after a significant update, my favorite RSS app just got better…
* Just a few days ago, Alphonso Labs Inc posted a new version of Pulse News Mini to the App Store. The good news is it still won’t cost you anything to download. If you liked the old version of Pulse, you’re going to the love the new one.
* After downloading the update, I could instantly tell that Pulse had gotten faster. RSS feeds refresh quicker and there is no lag when using Pulse and multitasking. A lot of the new found quickness is owed to the updated menu system.

* It was like the user interface got a shave and a haircut. It looked good before, but now it looks great! It is so easy to add or remove RSS feeds, and even browse their RSS news sources. They have added tons of pre-made RSS feeds which is nice for those that are trying a feed reader for the first time.
* If you already use Pulse, grab the update. If you haven’t tried Pulse News Mini yet, do it. This is the perfect time to see what a great iPhone app should look like. It’s no wonder that Pulse News Mini finds itself in the App Store’s Hall of Fame.
