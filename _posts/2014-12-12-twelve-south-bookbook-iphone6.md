* Participating in the multi-billion dollar accessory industry yields substantial financial incentives for vendors that ready their cases by the time the next iPhone hits the market, but Twelve South has never been about the money alone.
* That’s especially evident in the case (pun intended) of the latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models. Because the new phones represent a major departure from the established phone design and form factor, Twelve South has decided to take their time to get their premium BookBook case right for the bigger iPhones.
* And it’s finally here. Introducing the BookBook for your iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* The result of their product design philosophy is the new BookBook for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, a premium leather case hand-distressed for a unique look which adds new features on top of the credit card and ID slots from BookBook editions for older iPhones.

* Unlike their recently-launched SurfacePad case that provides protection for your brand spanking new iPhone 6 without adding bulk and weight or concealing its design, BookBook is all about providing a versatile yet complete protection for your pricey pocket computer.

* Made from a hand-distressed leather, the case doubles as a wallet with compartments to store your credit cards, IDs and cash. Like other BookBooks, it looks very much like a Harry Potter spell book.

* Open the front cover to operate your handset, make and receive phone calls and interact with apps. Flip it out into a kickstand to prop up your device at an angle and enjoy your media, make and receive hands-free FaceTime calls, take group shouts with iOS 8 Camera’s self-timer function, turn your device into a handy bedtime alarm clock and so forth.

* Featuring a nice soft-touch shell inside the case that can be removed quickly from the wallet part, the BookBook makes it easy to use your device with a dashboard clip, workout armband or desktop charging stand.

* The wallet portion of the case has five pockets, or six in the case of the iPhone 6 Plus edition. “It’s the perfect wallet for today’s digital world, letting you pay with Apple Pay where available, or the old-fashioned way with cash – still welcome everywhere,” notes the firm.
* Check out the promotional video below.
* The BookBook for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus costs $60 a pop and can be purchased in black or brown leather. It’s currently available in limited quantity through the Twelve South webstore.
