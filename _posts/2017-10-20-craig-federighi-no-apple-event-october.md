* Apple has no plans whatsoever to hold a media event this month to introduce new products or update existing ones, shooting down speculation that the company might be holding a Mac-centric product event in October as it did in years past.
* A MacRumors reader emailed Craig to inquiry about the possibility of another Apple event this month, to which the executive reportedly replied, “I think we’re all keynoted out for the season.”
* We cannot vouch for the veracity of the exchange because the publication did not obtain full email headers that can be traced back to Apple’s headquarters.
* In October 2016, Apple held a dedicated event to unveil the new Macbook Pro with Touch Bar.
* Apple is scheduled to release three new products before the end of this year: the upcoming iPhone X, announced at a media event in September and arriving November 3, plus the HomePod wireless speaker and iMac Pro, which were both announced and previewed at WWDC back in the summer and scheduled to arrive some time in December.
