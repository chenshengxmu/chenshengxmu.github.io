* It appears that retailers are in full-on inventory clearance mode with the iPhone 5, in anticipation of a new model. Best Buy is currently taking $50 off the handset, Walmart is offering the device at a $70 discount, and it looks like AT&T wants in on the fun too.
* This morning, the country’s second largest carrier started a promotion that takes 50% off its entire smartphone lineup. Yes, that even includes the iPhone 5, which means that you can score an entry-level model of the popular handset for just $99 with contract…
* According to 9to5Toys, who was first to spot the promo, the offer is valid for both the iPhone 5 and 4S (for those interested, it makes the 4S $50) and includes both free shipping and activation if purchased online. The discounts show up just before checkout.
* It’s not unusual to see one outlet offer the iPhone at a slight discount, but when multiple retailers start cutting the price tag by $50+, you know something’s up. These companies are obviously trying to clear out their iPhone inventory ahead of the new model.
* That new model is believed to be the iPhone 5S, a familiar-looking handset with substantial internal and camera upgrades. Everything we’ve heard about the smartphone up to this point suggests Apple will unveil it sometime around September, as it did last year.
* It looks like AT&T’s half-off promotion is just good through the end of the month, so if you’re interested you’ll want to act fast. Also worth noting is that it appears the deal requires a trade-in device when redeemed in-stores, so order the phone online if you can.
