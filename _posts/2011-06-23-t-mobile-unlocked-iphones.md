* We’ve heard some staggering statistics for the jailbreak community recently. Saurik, the mastermind behind Cydia, estimates that there are anywhere between 10 to 15 million jailbroken iDevices in the world.
* The number of unlocked iPhone users is also perplexing. We did a story last month about China Mobile that suggested there were close to 4 million unlocked iPhones running on their network. How many unlocked iPhones do you think are in the U.S.?
* T-Mobile representatives believe there are over one million active iPhones currently on their network. That’s a huge number considering those customers don’t get access to T-Mobile’s 3 and 4G speeds.
* I wonder if that number includes factory unlocked iPhones that recently became available. I know it doesn’t include all the unlocked iPhones on AT&T’s network, or the folks that have home-grown unlocks with their local carriers.
* Though the stats seem high now, recent events suggest that unlocking the iPhone is a dying art. With an AT&T takeover looming and reports of T-Mobile branded iPhones being tested, it’s safe to assume the carrier will soon offer the smartphone legitimately.
* Regardless, the above numbers really speak volumes about the jailbreak community. Imagine all the work that went into developing the unlock processes and spreading the word.
* Are you on an unlocked iPhone? What network?
