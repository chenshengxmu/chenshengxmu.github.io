* Another day, another iPhone 6 leak. Two separate reports Tuesday claim to show what seem to be iPhone 6 components in a production setting. The first set shows off a genuine looking front panel part, depicting the size difference between the current four-inch form factor and the upcoming iPhone 6, said to come in 4.7 and 5.5-inch flavors.
* The other purported leak depicts some sort of batteries on a production tray that appear to share more than a passing resemblance to other iPhone batteries.
* I’ve included the photographs below the fold so give them a look and tell us what you think in the comments…
* The image top of post, which came via French blog NowhereElse.fr [Google translate], suggests these could be larger batteries for the upcoming iPhones. The blog spotted a modified metallic section on the batteries.
* We’re not sure what to make of this minor design change other than that the layout of the handset’s interior has changed from the current form factor.
* DigiTimes last month said Apple would be moving to automated production lines for iPhone 6 batteries, potentially giving Apple a chance to move manufacturing to wherever it likes down the road.
* Longer battery life was the #1 request by early iPhone 5 adopters, according to Apple’s internal memo used in the second California trial against Samsung.
* A form factor change gives Apple’s engineers more room to put a bigger battery inside to power that larger screen, but it’s unclear at this stage whether battery life will be improved as a result.
* The photographs below were first posted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo and reposted by French blog iPhon.fr [Google translate]. This is what a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 should feel like in one’s hand versus the four-inch iPhone 5. The larger device appears to have the same screen ratio as the iPhone 5.

* The image looks legitimate as the cutouts for the Home button, FaceTime camera, ambient light sensor and ear speaker are in the right places, at least compared to the current design.
* One thing is not the same, however…

* Notice a much thinner bezel?

* A sketchy report by The Korea Herald said Apple’s next iPhone would have a “bezel-free display” using a single-layered panel (versus four panels currently) that would allow for a thinner device, clearer images and improved energy efficiency.
* The rumors, alleged iPhone 6 cases and Apple’s supposed 2014 roadmap all point to a Fall release of at least one handsets, with the larger-screened model reportedly delayed until year-end due to difficulties with in-cell production tech for the larger 5.5-inch size.
* Would you prefer a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 over a 5.5-inch one?
