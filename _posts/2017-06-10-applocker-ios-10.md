* AppLocker by iOS developer Ori Kadosh, is one of the most popular app security jailbreak tweaks in Cydia, and it has been updated this week with full support for iOS 10.
* AppLocker lets you create a password that you will use to access your apps; it’s requested every time you launch an app, and if you can’t provide it, you can’t use the app.
* AppLocker gives you the peace of mind that people aren’t tampering with your stuff because it adds an extra layer of security beyond the passcode for your most sensitive apps, including: Cydia, Settings, Filza, and even those you’ve downloaded from the App Store for things like banking, social networking, and more.
* The tweak puts a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off and configure a host of options to tailor the tweak to your unique needs:

* Under the More preferences pane, you can:
* As you’ve seen so far, AppLocker has quite the impressive list of options, but since you might worried about someone going into the Settings app and changing your security options on you, you’ll be ecstatic to hear that the developer has you covered on this front too.
* When you open the tweak’s preferences pane in the Settings app to change your settings, you’re prompted for your password; like so:

* AppLocker is a great way to add an extra layer of security to your jailbroken iPhone or iPad when you think there’s a possibility someone might know your passcode. It’s also useful when you want to give someone else your device to use, but don’t want them using certain apps.
* If you’re interested in downloading AppLocker, it’s available for $0.99 from Cydia’s ModMyi repository. The tweak now supports jailbroken iOS 10 devices, in addition to iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.
