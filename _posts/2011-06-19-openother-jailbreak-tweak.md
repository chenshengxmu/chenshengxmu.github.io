* Every so often you’ll stumble across a jailbreak tweak that’s absolutely perfect for use as a practical joke.
* OpenOther fits well into this category; it’s great for driving your iPhone owning friends or family up a wall.
* That’s of course assuming that your friends or family have jailbroken iPhones, since OpenOther is a tweak available on Cydia for jailbroken iPhone’s only.
* This sneaky tweak allows you to reroute an app to another app, meaning that when you open one app, it opens another instead.
* Check inside for a full video demo of OpenOther in action…
* In order to use OpenOther, all you need to do is place your phone in jiggle mode and double tap on the app that you would like to reroute. After choosing your target app, a double tap on another app icon selects its rerouting destination.
* So in theory, you could assign someone’s Phone app to open their Settings app instead. It’s sure to drive them crazy when they repeatedly attempt (and fail) to make a phone call.
* The result of such a joke is sure to yield hilarity, but at the end of the day, I can’t think of any actual practical uses for this tweak other than for a good laugh.
* For you advanced pranksters, OpenOther does features a settings panel that allows you to enter the verbose name of the apps in question, but most of you will want to stick to the aforementioned jiggle mode method of enabling the tweak.
* OpenOther is the latest tweak in the TweakWeek series, and should be available for free shortly on Cydia.
* What do you think? Can you think of any other valid uses for this one?
