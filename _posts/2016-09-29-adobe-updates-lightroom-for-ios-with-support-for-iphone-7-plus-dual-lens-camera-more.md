* iOS 10 provides new APIs allowing third-party photography apps to capture and edit raw image data in the DNG format, and Lightroom for iPhone and Lightroom for iPad are among first apps to implement photo capture in the highest possible RAW quality. Earlier this week, Adobe released updates to Lightroom for iOS to help users take advantage of the new iPhone 7 camera’s raw shooting capabilities, including support for the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens camera.
* As mentioned, Lightroom for iPhone has optimization for the iPhone 7 and supports the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual lens camera. You also get improved color, lens and noise profiles when editing DNG RAW files captured on an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus.
* Lightroom for iPad has gained the above features, plus support for the wide gamut P3 color space and capturing of RAW photos in the DNG format via the in-app camera.
* DNG is Adobe’s open-source RAW format.
* RAW files store original image data captured by the camera sensor before it’s processed by the image signal processor. The format allows for maximum image quality and the greatest amount of editing flexibility.
* To use the DNG format in Lightroom on your iOS device, you need to have an iPhone or iPad that has a twelve-megapixel camera and runs iOS 10 or later. To learn more about the DNG format, read Adobe’s blog post.
* Lightroom for iPhone and Lightroom for iPad are available free in the App Store.
