* Samsung today took the wraps off a new smartphone for its Galaxy line called the ‘Galaxy Alpha.’ The company says the handset encapsulates its new design approach, featuring a “carefully constructed” compact body with a metal frame and a solid finish.
* In terms of specs, there isn’t anything too crazy under the hood. The Alpha sports a 4.7” HD Super AMOLED display, an octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM and a 12MP rear camera. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on board, and a host of other sensors…

* Here’s a rundown of the hardware: 4.7” HD Super AMOLED (1280 x 720), Octa Core (Quad 1.8GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) processor, 12MP (rear) and 2.1MP (front) cameras, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of internal memory (no SD card slot), and an 1,860 mAh battery.
* The really story here is the Alpha’s all-new metal design, which some folks are saying teeters dangerously close to that of Apple’s iPhone 5/5s. The two firms have gone to court over design infringement before, although they did recently call a semi-truce.
* Here’s what Samsung has to say about the new look:
* Concentrating on elegant aesthetics and compact construction, Samsung has taken a fresh approach to design with the Galaxy Alpha. Created to help consumers express their unique style without sacrificing functionality, the refined Galaxy Alpha features a sophisticated design with a metal frame, elegantly curved corners and a tactile soft back cover. In addition, it is visually balanced, with the perfect contrast of both a calming, soft matte finish and an eye-catching reflection from the metal frame. At less than 7 mm thick, the Galaxy Alpha is also one of the slimmest Galaxy devices ever, and its uniquely compact construction and light weight provides consumers with maximum in-hand grip and control.
* And here’s the official introduction video ‘Just Alpha’

* The timing of this device is also interesting. Samsung says that the Alpha will go on sale in early September, which is right around the time Apple is expected to announce its iPhone 6, and around the same time that Samsung is believed to unveil its Note 4.
* Unfortunately, there’s not much information at this time in terms of availability. Samsung hasn’t named any carrier partners for the Alpha yet, and there’s no word on pricing. We do, however, know it will come in black, white, gold, silver and blue colorways.
* Thoughts?
