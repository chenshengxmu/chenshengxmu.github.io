* A new feature is coming to what is arguably the best text messaging app for iOS. If you listened to our previous episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak, then you already have a good idea what it is. On the podcast, I speculated about what big new feature could be coming to biteSMS after its developer hinted about a brand new addition. My guess was Text Heads.
* Today, we can confirm that, indeed, Facebook inspired “Text Heads” are coming to biteSMS. After a few hints, the confirmation came straight from the horse’s mouth.
* Here is the tweet from the official biteSMS Twitter account:

* Despite their funny name, Facebook’s Chat Heads seem to be all the rage these days. Not only will we see a similar SMS oriented feature in the upcoming biteSMS 7.6 beta, but we recently gained a new tweak that brings Chat Heads right to iOS.
* When can you expect it? Any moment now. According to the biteSMS account: in a “few hours.” Keep it locked here for more coverage. In the meantime, tell us what you think about the possibility of using Facebook inspired Text Heads on your jailbroken device.
* Update: We have a picture of what the upcoming feature will look like.

* So, it’s not a replica of Facebook’s Chat Head’s after all. Instead, it looks like a Notification Center widget with “tap to” message shortcuts. Hmm, not going to lie, that seems a bit underwhelming, but I’ll reserve judgement until I try it myself. By the way, the new feature is due on Tuesday now.
* What do you guys think?
