* Wearable maker Fitbit on Wednesday announced a brand new activity tracker with fashionable design that gives you the ability to swap bands.
* Featuring five days of usage on a single charge and a selection of bands, including leather ones and a stainless steel bracelet, Fitbit hopes to appeal to the burgeoning market of stylish tech gadgets that are worn on one’s body.
* The Alta has the usual assortment of movement-tracking sensors and includes a slim touchscreen OLED display that shows basic stats and notifications relayed from a smartphone.
* Designed with a satin finish and featuring a stainless steel body, this wearable accessory tracks everything from sleep to your running sessions and workouts, while providing smart notifications on your wrist and a suite of new activity features.
* Like Fitbit’s new $200 Blaze activity smartwatches, the Alta implements the company’s SmartTracker software functions that automatically detect and record your exercise and sleep routines.

* The device tracks steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned and active minutes. A companion smartphone app allows users to set their weekly goals. Like the Apple Watch, the Alta will give a user reminders on when to move.
* Here’s Fitbit’s promotional video highlighting the Alta’s features.
* Like other Fitbit bracelets and activity trackers, the Alta pairs with an iPhone over Bluetooth to relay notifications for incoming calls, text messages and calendar alerts.
