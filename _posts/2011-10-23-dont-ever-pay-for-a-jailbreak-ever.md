* Sometimes you write a post and you think, “Does this really need to be said?” In this case, it unfortunately does.
* There have been recent reports that people have been scammed into paying for fake iOS 5 untethered jailbreaks. You should never, ever pay for a jailbreak… ever.
* International Business Times:
* “A tethered jailbreak, dubbed Redsn0w 0.9.9, is released by Dev-team while an untethered version is out from FastUnlockiPhone.com named FastRa1n 0.5.
* Even though the tethered Redsn0w seems to be completely authentic as it is free for download and comes from the Dev-team which has been making programs to jailbreak iOS for time and time again, the credibility of FasRa 1n is in questions.
* The first doubt strikes iOS 5 users when FastUnlockiPhone.com charges $24.99 for the untethered jailbreak. And the second one comes when they read a comment from a Dev-team confirming the untethered jailbreak a fake.”
* I’m going to assume that the large majority of our esteemed iDB readership would know that something like FastRa1n is fake as fake can be. But for those that would be easily fooled, know this: you should never have to pay for a jailbreak, ever.
* The developers that work hard to create jailbreak tools like RedSn0w and GreenPosi0n do it for the jailbreak community. They sometimes take donations, but these developers release jailbreaks for us all to use for free. That’s what jailbreaking is about: freedom. Paying for a jailbreak goes against the very philosophy that jailbreaking stems from.
* Sites like iDB provide the internet with news, tutorials, downloads, and reviews for the jailbreak community. Tools like RedSn0w and Sn0wBreeze can be downloaded for free and used to jailbreak your own iDevices for free.
* As far as the untethered iOS 5 jailbreak goes, Cody explained the state of the iOS 5 jailbreak yesterday. There hasn’t been an official untether released yet, so disregard anyone you see on the internet trying to sell you an iOS 5 untether. Unless it comes from iDB or someone like MuscleNerd, it’s a scam.
* Patience is a virtue. The real untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 is almost here.
