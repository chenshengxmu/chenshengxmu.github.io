* The big news with the Music app in iOS 7 is iTunes radio, but the interface to the Music app in general received a huge update. Compare what we’re currently using to what we’re going to get with iOS 7, and the current Music app appears hopelessly outdated.

* The new music app features a brand new interface,and even ditches cover flow for a new album art focused landscape view. A tap of any of the album art while in landscape view will zoom in and show the track listing for the album in question.

* Obviously the huge news here is the new iRadio integration, which brings pandora like features directly to iOS stock Music app. The iRadio feature is free (supported by ads) or you can enjoy it ad-free with an iTunes match subscription.
