* HTC and its latest One A9 flagship smartphone have been accused of copying the iPhone 6 design and its much criticized antenna bands on the back (HTC, needless to say, begs to differ).
* But now, the ailing Taiwanese handset maker has taken things to the next level with a brand new advertising campaign that revolves around the tagline ‘Be Different’.
* In a 90-second commercial posted to HTC’s YouTube channel, a young and hip runner is portrayed in a dystopian-like world where everything is white and clean, unified and supposedly Apple-like. To make it perfectly clear who the Big Brother is this time around, HTC’s hero can be seen kicking a bunch of white apples, apparently to stand up to the Man and make a point.
* Here’s that ad.
* Is this commercial going to inspire some smartphone owners to “Be Different. Be Loud. Be Inspired. Be Free. Be Brilliant,” as the tagline suggests, do you think?
