* Many apps are now following a new trend where taking a screenshot will yield an in-house notification for sharing it. We’ve seen this in apps like Amazon and Spotify, and now Instagram is doing it too.
* If you’d like to disable this banner in the Instagram app to keep it from appearing whenever you take a screenshot of someone’s post, then we’d recommend a new jailbreak tweak called ShyInstaShot by iOS developer CydiaGeek.
* Installing this tweak enables you to take screenshots of the Instagram app without getting haggled by the banner you see in the illustration above.
* For the most part, the banner Instagram sics on screenshot-takers isn’t intrusive since it stays within the confines of the navigation bar. Nevertheless, it still triggers some people’s O.C.D. symptoms because it’s a little bit bothersome to those who never use it.
* While I can appreciate Instagram trying to make sharing things with others more accessible, I’ve found that the banner only offers options for sharing to Facebook, Tweeting, and copying a link to the Instagram post to your clipboard. That said, none of these options are ideal for someone who wants to save an image to their Camera Roll for any reason.
* ShyInstaShot doesn’t come with any options to configure and should start working as soon as you install it. If you don’t see any change after installation, then you may need to force-quit the Instagram app from the App Switcher and restart it to append your changes.
* If you’re interested in grabbing ShyInstaShot for yourself, then you’ll be delighted to hear it’s a free download and works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and 10 devices with the official Instagram app installed on them. You won’t find the tweak in any of Cydia’s default repositories, so you’ll need to add CydiaGeek’s repository to Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you should be able to find and install ShyInstaShot by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
* Do you find yourself annoyed by the uptick in apps that are adopting these kinds of ‘screenshot sharing’ banners? Let us know in the comments section below!
