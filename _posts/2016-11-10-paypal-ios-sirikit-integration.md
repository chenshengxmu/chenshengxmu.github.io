* PayPal’s iPhone and iPad application was updated on the App Store this morning with support for iOS 10’s SiriKit integration for mobile payments, allowing you to send and request money in 30 countries around the world using just your voice.
* With a simple voice command like “Send $20 to Dad using PayPal” or “Request $20 from John with PayPal”, Siri connects with the PayPal service and pulls up a custom sheet with details of your transaction before you authorize it.
* The ability to send and request PayPal money through Siri is available in a variety of languages to customers in the following countries:
* In addition to SiriKit integration, PayPal 6.7 for iOS also includes a new feature that lets you invite a friend to sign up for PayPal. “It’s a faster, safer way to send and receive money for things like concert tickets, splitting bills, sharing taxis and more,” said the firm.
* PayPal for iOS is available free on the App Store.
* After updating to PayPal 6.7 or later, be sure to manually enable SiriKit integration in Settings → Siri → App Support.
* With the holidays around the corner, PayPal predicts more than 17 million peer-to-peer transactions in the month of December alone so today’s update arrives just in time for the holiday spending spree.
