* No more sliding! Just Tapping. That’s the headline for the description for TapToUnlock7 in Cydia, and I have to say, it’s apt. TapToUnlock7 is a tweak that gets rid of the “slide to unlock” action and replaces it with a simple tap.
* TapToUnlock7 works with both passcode enabled devices and unsecured devices. When you have a passcode enabled, a tap will activate the passcode screen, and when you have the passcode disabled, you’ll be whisked away right to iOS’ Home screen.
* The tweak features a variety of customization options to change up the look and feel of the tap to unlock button on the Lock screen. Have a look inside as we explore various facets of this brand new release.
* After installing TapToUnlock7, you can just start using it as is. Go to the Lock screen, and you should see the tap to unlock button. Tap the button, and your device will unlock.

* Inside of the tweak’s preferences, you’ll find tons of nuanced settings for changing the look of the tap to unlock button. There, you’ll also find a toggle for enabling tap anywhere functionality. As you might have guessed,  tap anywhere allows you to tap anywhere on the Lock screen to unlock the device.
* Although it features a lot of customization options, most of those options pertain to the look of the tweak. At its root, TapToUnlock7 is a simple tweak with one basic function. If you’re looking for a quicker way to unlock your device, then TapToUnlock7 is a solid candidate.
