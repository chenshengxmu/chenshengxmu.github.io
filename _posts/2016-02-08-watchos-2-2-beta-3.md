* Apple on Monday seeded the third beta for its incoming watchOS 2.2 update to developers. The release is available as an OTA upgrade via the Apple Watch app for those already on 2.2, or as a standalone download from Apple’s developer website.
* Beta 3 comes two weeks after beta 2, and a month after the original watchOS 2.2 beta was released. The update includes a handful of new features, such as the ability to pair more than one Apple Watch with an iPhone and Maps app improvements.
* In addition to watchOS 2, Apple has also pushed out new betas this morning for iOS 9.3, tvOS 9.2, and OS X 10.11.4. We are expecting the official versions of these updates to be available to the public either later this month, or sometime in early March.
