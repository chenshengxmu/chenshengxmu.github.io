* Did he say “Everyday I’m awesome, awesome, awesome,” or “Yet again I’m hustling, hustling, hustling?” If you often ask questions like that, then perhaps some lyrics to your favorite songs might help.
* WeeLyrics makes it easy by placing lyrics right in iOS 5’s Notification Center…
* If your lyrics aren’t embedded in the song, then WeeLyrics is smart enough to hit the web and download the lyrics as well.
* Unfortunately, WeeLyrics only works with the stock Music or iPod app, so Spotify and Pandora users will have to seek out other means of musical clarification.
* If you’re a heavy Music app listener, then WeeLyrics could be worth it at $0.99. If you’re interested and jailbroken, head over to Cydia in order to download it.
* What do you think?
