* Ahead of Worldwide Developers Conference which kicks off next Monday with a keynote, accessory maker Elgato has launched several smart devices for the connected home built on Apple’s HomeKit platform that it previewed at CES 2015. These accessories use Bluetooth Low Energy and a special iOS app so they’re battery-friendly and fully controllable through your iPhone.
* As first noted by German blog iFun.de, the company’s smart home sensor dubbed the Eve, along with other accessories such as the Eve Room, Eve Weather, Door & Window Eve and Eve Energy, can now be pre-ordered from Amazon.com.
* These devices make a vision of the HomeKit-enabled connected home a reality by gathering data on air quality, temperature, humidity, air pressure, energy consumption and more.
* A smart sensor for Apple’s HomeKit, the Eve Room senses indoor air quality, temperature and humidity using a sophisticated sensor which analyzes volatile organic compounds.

* It’s Siri-compatible, has built-in batteries and is fully controllable via an iPhone app that breaks down your data by day, month or year.
* The Eve Room is $79.95 at Amazon.com.
* As its name implies, this accessory senses temperature, humidity and air pressure. Put it on your patio or in your garden for best results and use a companion app to access your personal weather data at your actual home.

* The app gives you insight into your personal weather data by day, month or year. It does not require a hub or gateway, has long-lasting, replaceable batteries and works with Siri so you can get current temperature and humidity data using your voice.
* The Eve Weather is $49.95 at Amazon.com.
* A wireless contact sensor for your home, the Eve Door & Window understands whether your door or window is open or closed, allowing you to remotely check the current open/closed state and view statistics on time and duration.

* Using Siri, you can even ask for the current open/closed state of the doors and windows at your home while you’re at work or on vacation, giving you a piece of mind.
* The Elgato Eve Door & Window is $39.95 at Amazon.com.
* The Eve Energy connects between a power outlet and electrical devices like vacuum cleaners, computers, mobile devices and so forth. Its main purpose is to give you an insight into your energy consumption and hopefully help you cut your energy bill.

* The accessory understands your energy consumption and lets you see how much energy your devices are using. You can then switch individual devices on or off with a tap in a companion app, or by using Siri.
* The Elgato Eve Energy is $49.95 at Amazon.com.
* As mentioned before, these devices take advantage of a special iPhone app called Eve, available at no charge in the App Store. With it, you can control all of Elgato’s HomeKit-certified devices, view all collected data, control any accessory manually or through Siri and much more.

* As HomeKit technology provides advanced security, data exchanged between the Eve gear and your iOS devices is protected with end-to-end encryption and authentication.
* The 8.4-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.3 or later. Keep in mind that controlling HomeKit-enabled accessories away from home requires a third-generation Apple TV with Apple TV software 7.0 or later and an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 8.1 or later.
