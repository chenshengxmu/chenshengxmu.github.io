* Thanks to Bluetooth LE connectivity, users are able to connect their smartphones to their computers to share content between devices quickly, easily, and without being too taxing for battery life. On iOS and OS X, you can even do stuff like lock or unlock your Mac. Mac ID for iOS is one such app. Not only can you set it up to unlock your computer, but you can also lock it and wake the screen remotely. We’ve got a hands-on review of MacID for iOS for you today.
* If you are smart, you lock your computer when you aren’t using it, especially if you tend to take it out of the house. However, locking a computer can be a pain if the password is too complex. If your energy saving settings put your computer to sleep after just a few minutes, it’s even worse (you know what I mean, right?).
* With MacID, you can simply use your fingerprint to unlock your screen. That way, you can set as complex a password as you like and still be able to unlock it with just a tap.
* The app shows you a list of connected, or paired, devices against a pink screen. You will also notice a list of recently connected devices.
* The settings section is in the right corner at the bottom of the screen. Here, you can turn off your device’s discoverability feature, which must be on in order to use with MacID, but can be switched off to save battery life when you aren’t near your computer.
* MacID requires very specific hardware for OS X and iOS. So, check out the supported devices listed in the summary before buying the app.

* After downloading the iOS app, download the Mac companion from http://macid.co/get. Once installed, open the iOS app first. You’ll see that there are no connected devices. Then, open the OS X app. You will see the name of your iOS device listed under Connected Devices on your Mac app. Select that device.
* Once paired, enter your Mac’s password to enable the ability to unlock it. Then, you are ready to go.
* You can now lock your Mac in three new ways, either choose “Lock Screen” from the available options in the MacID app for OS X, swipe to the left on the selected computer in the iOS app and tap “Lock,” or turn on “Auto-lock when away from Mac” in the OS X app menu.
* The third options is a great idea for ensuring that you don’t forget to lock the screen when you leave your desk, but you’ll have to remember to bring your iPhone with you.
* There are also new ways to unlock your Mac now. When you first wake your computer, you will receive a notification from MacID for iOS that your computer is requesting authorization. Swipe to the left to open the option menu, and then tap “Authorize.” Then, use Touch ID or your iPhone’s password to unlock it.
* You can also manually and remotely unlock it from within the iOS app. Open the app on your iPhone and tap the computer you wish to unlock. You will be asked to enter your password or use Touch ID to unlock it.
* You can lock, wake, or unlock your Mac via the MacID for iOS app. Select the device and swipe to the left to see all three options and tap the one you’d like to use.

* This app worked perfectly and I had no issues with it whatsoever. I love that I can both lock and unlock my Mac from anywhere, even if I’m not right in front of it.
* I didn’t find any flaw in this app. It worked seamlessly and smoothly. It was easy to set up and worked exactly the way it should.
* MacID for iOS costs $3.99. On first glance, you may think that the app is a bit on the pricey side. However, it is more than just an app for unlocking your computer with Touch ID. You can also lock it and wake it remotely. If you think this is just a novelty, don’t buy it. If you see the value in using Touch ID to unlock your Mac, the price is more than fair.
* I think this app is worth the four dollars, without question. However, I know some of our readers will turn their noses up at the price. If you have a complex password for unlocking your Mac and wish you could make the process easier, you’ll agree that it is worth the price. Download MacID in the App Store today.
