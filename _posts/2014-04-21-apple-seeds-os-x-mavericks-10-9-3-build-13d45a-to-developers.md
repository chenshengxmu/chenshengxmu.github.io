* Apple has seeded OS X 10.9.3 build 13D45a to developers on Monday, following the release of build 13D43 last week.
* Apple didn’t detail features of the new build, but once again asks developers to focus on Graphics Drivers, Audio, Mail, Contacts and Calendar sync over USB in iTunes, and Safari.
* We’ve seen a number of enhancements in 10.9.3 thus far, including the addition of a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays and the restoration of the ability to sync contacts and calendar info.
* Developers registered with Apple’s Mac developer program can download the update through the Mac App Store’s Software Update feature or through the Mac Developer Center website.
* We’ll let you know if there any new features worth noting.
