* Did MuscleNerd spoke too fast when he said last week that we’d get an untethered jailbreak for Christmas? It sure looks like it when reading this tweet Comex sent out a few minutes ago saying that he was going to miss his Christmas deadline..
* At this point, I’m not sure whether Comex is working on an untethered solution or a full new jailbreak tool (jailbreakme?) One thing is sure though, we might not get anything from him this Christmas…
* This hasn’t been confirmed yet so there is no reason to freak out about it. I know I’d rather wait a few more days and have a fully functional and stable jailbreak rather than having a half-baked tool that ends up screwing things up.
* What do you think?
