* Apple has scrapped plans to announce its long-rumored streaming TV service at its upcoming September 9 event, reports Bloomberg. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says that content deal talks with 21st Century Fox and others have been progressing slowly.
* Additionally, Apple also doesn’t have the computer network capacity in place to ensure a good viewing experience—a common complaint among users of Dish’s Sling TV and other streaming services. Thus, the company has decided to push back the launch of its service to 2016.
* For those unfamiliar with the story, Apple has been working on an over-the-Internet TV service with a slimmer channel set and cheaper monthly fee than traditional cable. It was rumored we would see the service debut this year, but the project continues to experience set-backs.
* On a more positive note, Bloomberg adds that Apple is still planning to introduce a new set-top box at an event next month. The refreshed Apple TV is said to be far more powerful than the current model, with a touchpad remote control and support for native apps and games.
