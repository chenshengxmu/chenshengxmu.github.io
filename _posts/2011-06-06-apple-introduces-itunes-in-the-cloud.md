* Here is the feature a lot of you were waiting for: iTunes in the cloud. This new feature will allow you to sync your songs purchased in iTunes across all your devices. Let’s say for example you download a song on your iPhone, you can then grab your iPad, see your purchased history, and decide to download all or individual songs to your iPad, at no additional cost.
* Even better, you can turn a setting on so the song you purchased are automatically downloaded to your other devices. This is just a killer feature…
* And the cherry on top… iTunes Match:
* If you want all the benefits of iTunes in the Cloud for music you haven’t purchased from iTunes, iTunes Match is the perfect solution. It lets you store your entire collection, including music you’ve ripped from CDs or purchased somewhere other than iTunes. For just $24.99 a year.2
* Here’s how it works: iTunes determines which songs in your collection are available in the iTunes Store. Any music with a match is automatically added to your iCloud library for you to listen to anytime, on any device. Since there are more than 18 million songs in the iTunes Store, most of your music is probably already in iCloud. All you have to upload is what iTunes can’t match. Which is much faster than starting from scratch. And all the music iTunes matches plays back at 256-Kbps iTunes Plus quality — even if your original copy was of lower quality.
* iTunes Match has a cost though: $25/year. Is accessing your music anywhere worth that? Only you can decide.
