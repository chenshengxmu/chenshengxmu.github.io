* Those rocking the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10 and who are looking for the best jailbreak tweaks to install on their devices have come to the right place. We’re working on a series of roundups that cover the best tweaks for each exclusive part of iOS.
* In this piece, we’ll discuss the best jailbreak tweaks for Notification Center that were released following the launch of the iOS 10 jailbreak.
* 1. 3DLight

* If you hate the way stock widget transparency looks in Notification Center, then a jailbreak tweak called 3DLight offers some options for changing things up.
* While the tweak makes changes to your 3D Touch menus, it just so happens that the opacity effects also impact your Notification Center widgets.
* You can learn more about the tweak and how it impacts your Notification Center’s widget opacity in our full review. You can also download it free of cost from Cydia.
* 2. AccessWithinApps

* Sometimes when using apps or playing games, you get interrupted by the little grabbers that indicate launching Control Center or Notification Center. These can be annoying, and anyone who’s been in this situation knows why as it gets in the way of plenty of interface buttons and more.
* AccessWithinApps lets you disable access to these interfaces from any apps you choose. You can configure an application blacklist so you can’t launch Control Center or Notification Center (or see their grabbers) in any of the enabled apps.
* You can read more about AccessWithinApps in our full review. If you feel you need this tweak, it’s available for free in Cydia.
* 3. BouncyNC10

* Any time you launch Notification Center, you’re greeted with a mild bounce effect when the bottom of the interface slams down on the bottom of your display. If you don’t like how this effect looks, BouncyNC10 can spice things up by making the animation more robust.
* Even if you don’t like the animation that much, the tweak includes an option for eliminating the animation altogether, so it’s a tweak that can benefit both parties.
* You can learn more about BouncyNC10 in our full review. The tweak can be had for free from Cydia.
* 4. ColorBanners

* ColorBanners lets you colorize your Notification Center banners, as well as the rest of the banner notifications throughout iOS.
* There are a number of ways to colorize your banners, whether you want to go by the dominant color in the app’s icon or choose a static color for everything. You can also change the gradient and text color if you choose to.
* You can learn more about what ColorBanners is capable of in our full review, which goes over everything. If you’re interested, you can grab the tweak for $0.99 from Cydia.
* 5. DisplayWeather 10

* For some reason, iPhone and iPad users have an unhealthy fascination with weather information. DisplayWeather 10 can help with our marveling desire to always see this information.
* The tweak puts weather information at the top of the widget page on the Lock screen and in Notification Center, just to the left of the date. The weather information gets data from the Weather app, so it matches the other weather information you would typically see anywhere else in iOS.
* It lets you disable the Weather widget so you can dedicate its space to something else, all while still seeing your weather information at a glance.
* You can learn more about how DisplayWeather 10 works in our full review. It’s a freebie that can be downloaded from Cydia.
* 6. Falcon

* Everyone likes a tweak that makes iOS more useful, and Falcon is one of those special tweaks because it lets you get more done from the Lock screen and Notification Center.
* It adds new pages, including a dedicated web browser, a note-taker, and a toggle system that’s far more advanced than the one in Control Center.
* You can choose the pages that are enabled and the ones that aren’t. Additionally, you can choose the order in which they appear. Your toggles can also be Touch ID-protected so no one else beside you can change the settings on your device.
* You can read our full review of Falcon to see how it works. The tweak is available for the very fair price of just $1.49.
* 7. NCNoPageBounce

* When moving between pages in Notification Center, you get a subtle bounce animation that lets you know you’re at your paging limits.
* NCNoPageBounce is a tweak that disables these bounce effects for those who don’t like them.
* You can read our full review of NCNoPageBounce to learn more about it, as well as a tweak that does something similar for Control Center. Both are free downloads from Cydia.
* 8. NoDots10

* Lots of interfaces in iOS have dots in them for various reasons, and Notification Center just happens to be one of those. They’re not only an eyesore, but they’ve been in iOS for so long that some people simply get sick of looking at them.
* NoDots10 removes the dots from many interfaces of iOS, including Control Center and Notification Center. The tweak also hides dots from newly-installed apps and beta apps too. You can configure what dots appear and what ones don’t from the tweak’s settings.
* To learn more about what interfaces the tweak works on, check out our full review. You can download it for free from Cydia.
* 9. Unify

* Unify organizes the notifications you receive in iOS 10 and is a great way to address your OCD problem. It groups all of your notifications by app or by time (your choice) so that they’re easier to read. The tweak works from both the Lock screen and Notification Center, hence its place in this post.
* As it includes various other options to clean up the way notifications look, Unify is a great addition to any jailbroken device, so we’d recommend checking it out.
* You can learn more about what Unify is capable of in our full review. The tweak can be downloaded from Cydia for $1.99.
* 10. WidgeficationX

* Since widgets are popular in Notification Center, it only makes sense to have a way to customize them if you’re jailbroken.
* WidgeficationX lets you control the transparency effects of your Notification Center widgets, from the backgrounds to their headers. You can create stunning visualizations or go full minimalist if you choose to.
* To learn more about what you can do with WidgeficationX, we recommend reading our full review, which goes over everything. The tweak is available for free in Cydia.
* While the iOS 10 jailbreak has offered oodles of fun so far, it won’t be too long before iOS 11 gets teased and the first betas are launched. It should be interesting to see how much inspiration Apple takes from the jailbreak community this time around, just as they do time and time again.
