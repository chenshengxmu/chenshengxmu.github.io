* It’s finally here folks, the official downgrade tool for A5 devices!
* Indeed, you can now downgrade your iPhone 4S, iPad 2, or new iPad (iPad 3) with the latest version of RedSn0w 0.9.11b1. Downgrading will allow you to perform an untethered jailbreak on your iPhone 4S, or iPad 2 running iOS 5.0.1 firmware.
* Check out our tutorial for the step-by-step downgrade instructions inside…
* Note: You must have your SHSH blobs for iOS 5.0.1 either stored locally by means of TinyUmbrella, etc., or Cydia must have your 5.0.1 blobs for this downgrade to work successfully.
* Step 1: Download the latest version of RedSn0w 0.9.11b1 from our downloads page.
* Step 2: Download the latest firmware (5.1.1) for your device from our downloads page, along with the 5.0.1 firmware.
* Step 3: Place your device into DFU mode.
* Step 4: Run RedSn0w 0.9.11b1, and make sure RedSn0w detects your device in DFU mode. Navigate to Extras > Even more > Restore and click IPSW under the IPSW section. RedSn0w will then ask you for your iOS 5.0.1 IPSW. Once you locate iOS 5.0.1, RedSn0w will ask your for the latest firmware (iOS 5.1.1).

* Step 5: Once both firmwares have been validated, it’s time to locate your saved SHSH blobs. If you’ve jailbroken your device before, you should have those available on Cydia, and therefore you can use the Remote option. If you’ve never jailbroken your device before, but you saved your SHSH blobs with a tool like TinyUmbrella, then choose Local and browse your computer for your blobs. We’d recommend clicking the Remote option first.

* Step 6: Once your blobs have been verified, there is nothing left for you to do, just let RedSn0w execute the full process. First RedSn0w will install a hacked version of the latest firmware (iOS 5.1.1), and then it will downgrade your firmware to iOS 5.0.1.
* Step 7: Upon downgrading successfully you will be presented with a success message. Now all you have to do is setup your device, and verify that you are now on iOS 5.0.1 via Settings > General > About on your device.

* Most people will want to jailbreak their newly downgraded device. If you’re using an A5 device like the iPad 2, or iPhone 4S, you can now jailbreak using Corona-A5. You can do this directly from RedSn0w. We will have a tutorial that shows you how to jailbreak your A5 device using RedSn0w in the near future. Until then, you can always use a tool like Absinthe to jailbreak as well.

* Important: If you rely on a software unlock or SIM interposer for your iPhone, beware! This method will update your baseband, and you could permanently lose your unlock.
