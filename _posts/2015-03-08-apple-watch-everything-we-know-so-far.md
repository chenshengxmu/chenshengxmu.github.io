title: Apple Watch- everything we know so far

* Speculation has surrounded Apple Watch for years – far back into the technological dark ages when it was referred to as ‘iWatch’ – but, despite being exceedingly more enlightened at present, we still don’t know everything about Apple’s long-awaited wearable.
* That will change on Monday when Apple’s ‘Spring Forward’ event goes live, at which time more information about Apple Watch is expected to release, including prices and additional features. After the event, those attending will likely be able to go hands-on with an array of fully functioning Apple Watches in the white structure going up beside the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.
* The team at iDownloadBlog will be covering the keynote as it happens, per usual. Until then, however, tech and fashion enthusiasts must occupy themselves with the facts given us by Apple and leaks from other sources. As a result, we’ve compiled everything we know and think we know about Apple Watch.
* Now that we know a lot of what Apple Watch can do, it seems clear that Apple has been planning this device for a very long time. iOS 8, for example, brought Continuity and Handoff, two key components in Apple Watch’s interaction with iPhone. iOS’s Health currently integrates with third-party health and fitness apps to display data, but its long term purpose is evidently to sync with Apple Watch. iOS 8’s Predictive keyboard is simply a foreshadowing of suggested replies for Messages on Apple Watch, and the list goes on.
* It’s difficult – even ludicrous – to imagine that any of these components were developed only for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite integration and added to Apple Watch as an afterthought. Instead, Apple has been easing users into these features over time, as well as testing them out in other scenarios, in order for Apple Watch’s functionality to smoothly integrate into what people already love about iOS 8.
* Further still, iOS 7’s design was thrown together rather quickly – the iOS 6 look was dropped not long after Jonathan Ive was made design chief – but Apple Watch has been Jony’s pet project for years, and its UI seems to be a much better representation of what Sir Ive considers excellence in software design.
* Because of the obvious care that has gone into this device, Apple has a lot riding on Monday’s event and the success of the company’s first wearable. We’re sure to see new features that were saved for the final announcement, and I’m confident that Apple has more to tell us than they showcased in September.
* Excitement always piques among technology fans before a presentation, but tomorrow’s event will be different. Not because it’s Apple’s keynote or because we might see product refreshes, but because Apple is entering an entirely new market. Sure, we saw a rather large glimpse last year, but there are still a lot of lingering questions that have yet to be answered, many of which will be a turning point for potential customers. People often list each new iPhone keynote as a critical moment for the company’s future, but tomorrow – when Apple tries to sell its brand new product to the world – is far more pivotal than any event we’ve seen for years.
