* Apple on Tuesday updated its Investor Relations webpage to confirm that it will be announcing its financial earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter (or third calendar quarter) of 2014 this month. The earnings statement will be released at 1:30 PM PST on October 20, with a conference call scheduled for 2 PM.
* This earnings report will cover the three month period from July through September, giving us our first real glimpse at how Apple’s new handsets are selling. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were unveiled at a media event this month, and launched in several countries on September 19 with record-breaking figures.
* From an overall revenue and hardware sales standpoint, Q4 was likely a dull quarter for Apple. In Q3 the company said that rumors of new devices were affecting iPhone sales, and that was likely the case this time around for Macs and iPads as well, as many consumers have caught on to Apple’s fall refresh cycle.
* Still, Tim Cook and team should have a lot of interesting things to talk about, with Apple Pay coming soon and the marketing push for Apple Watch now in full swing. As always, we’ll be providing full coverage of the call here on iDB, posting financial results and any other announcements or notable highlights.
* [Apple]
