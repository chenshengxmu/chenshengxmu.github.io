* There have been rumors going around for a while that Sprint would be added as a new carrier for the iPhone 4S, and today Apple made this official. Our very own Jeff broke the news before everyone else earlier today, but it’s now a done deal.
* You’ll be able to pre-order or buy the iPhone 4S for Sprint, as of October 7th…
* But that’s not it, as iDB reader Azharhamzahya noted in the comments section below, Sprint will also get the iPhone 4, too.
* Let’s wish Sprint good luck as they will have to unload $20 billion worth of iPhones during the next 4 years.
