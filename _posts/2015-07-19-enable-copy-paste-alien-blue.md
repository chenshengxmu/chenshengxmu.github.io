* Alien Blue is the official and most popular Reddit client on iOS, but it lacks one feature that I’ve always found annoying—the ability to easily copy and paste the text of posts.
* A new jailbreak tweak called ABCopyTXT just recently appeared on Cydia, and it allows you to easily copy text in Alien Blue using the stock iOS share sheet. Have a look at our walkthrough to see how it works.

* Once you install ABCopyTXT, there are no options to configure. Simply open the Alien Blue app, find text from a post that you wish to copy, and tap and hold on that text. Doing this will invoke the stock iOS share sheet, which contains a Copy option.
* You can also use any of the other sharing features, like Messages, Mail, and third-party sharing solutions as well. If you’re a big time Alien Blue user, then this is a tweak that you will no doubt find useful on a day-to-day basis.
* If you’d like to try ABCopyTXT, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can find it for download free of charge.
* Are you an big time Alien Blue user? If you are, would you consider using ABCopyTXT?
