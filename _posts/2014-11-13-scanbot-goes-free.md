* Scanbot, a PDF scanning utility with built-in QR code scanner, hit a major milestone as its users have scanned over five million documents to date. To celebrate this achievement, German developer Doo GmbH is giving away the basic edition of Scanbot for the next 24 hours, a $1.99 saving.
* Moreover, Scanbot Pro is marked down 40 percent and now sells for $2.99 instead of the regular asking price of $4.99 a pop, representing a cool saving of two bucks.
* This is the first time Scanbot Pro has been made available at a discounted price in the App Store. Grab Scanbot at no cost for the next 24 hours and upgrade to Scanbot Pro via a one-time In-App Purchase at 40 percent reduced price.
* Scanbot lets you send your high-quality (200 dpi and higher) PDF or JPG scans via email or upload them to iCloud Drive, Box, Dropbox, Evernote and other cloud services.

* The app can scan QR codes for URLs, contacts, phone numbers, locations, hotspots and other underlying data types, and is really fast and responsive. Scanbot’s engine features automatic edge detection, color modes, automatic optimization smart background uploading and more.
* Check it out in action in a quick promo video below.
* Unlike its basic counterpart, Scanbot Pro adds up to the experience with gorgeous UI themes, smart file naming, passcode protection with Touch ID support and the ability to extract the text of your scans to copy, search, lookup and what not.
* An update earlier this month added the following enhancements:
* Two months following its April 2014 App Store debut, Scanbot added a native iPad interface and smart QR code scanning. Fun fact: putting five million documents next to each other equals the distance from Paris to Rome.

* Scanbot, a 38-megabyte download, requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. iOS 8.0+ is required for Touch ID protection. To upgrade to Scanbot Pro for $2.99 instead of $4.99 (again, valid for the next 24 hours), go to in-app settings and tap “Scanbot Pro”.
