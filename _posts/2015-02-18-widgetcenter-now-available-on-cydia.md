* WidgetCenter—the Reachability piggybacking tweak that we previewed a while back—is finally available on Cydia after some delays. From developer Mitch Treece, who’s well-known for tweaks like Aero, Deck, Fancy, and more, it’s one of the better looking Reachability releases that I’ve seen thus far.
* WidgetCenter comes bundled with four built-in widgets like WCTime, WCMusic, WCSwitcher, and WCControls. It’s now available for the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, and can be found on the BigBoss repo for $1.99.
* Have you tried WidgetCenter yet? If so, what are your thoughts on the tweak?
