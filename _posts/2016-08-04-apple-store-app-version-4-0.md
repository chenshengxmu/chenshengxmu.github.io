* As expected, Apple on Thursday released an update for its Apple Store app, bringing the online shopping client to version 4.0. Fulfilling previous reports, the update includes a redesigned interface, and a new ‘For You’ recommendation feature that offers you suggestions on products to buy based on your previous purchases.
* Here are your release notes:
* • Get recommendations and shop for new products based on what works with the Apple devices you already own. • Manage your Apple account at a glance with the updated, easy-to-use Account tab. • Learn about helpful workshops and exciting events happening at your nearest Apple Store.   • Stay on top of your in-store activities. Find out when your order is ready for pickup and see what time your reservation starts.  • Scan a product at a participating Apple Store to get more information, make sure it’s compatible, and buy it from your iPhone. • Find out if a product you’ve added to Favorites is available when you visit a participating store.
* And a few more screenshots:
