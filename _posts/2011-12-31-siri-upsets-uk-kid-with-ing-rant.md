* We all thought Siri was our friend, but it turns out that Apple’s digital assistant has a mean streak, especially if you happen to be 12 years-old and frequent one particular supermarket in the UK.
* When shopping at a Tesco store in Coventry, UK, one unsuspecting kid decided to have a play with Apple’s latest and greatest. Unfortunately, he got more than he bargained for.
* According to the report by the ethically-questionable The Sun, little Charlie Le Quense found himself on the wrong end of a four-letter tirade, which understandably took everyone aback…
* Thankfully, this is not the beginning of Siri becoming self-aware and fighting back, but rather the byproduct of a prankster.
* It would appear that a someone had taken advantage of Siri’s preference to refer to its handler by name – we’re sure you can imagine the rest. Putting the right text into Siri’s “My Info” field can cause all kinds of untold misery!
* Quite how Apple could prevent this from happening again, we are not so sure. Expect every Apple Store on the planet to have iPhones bleating out expletives on a regular basis from here on out.
