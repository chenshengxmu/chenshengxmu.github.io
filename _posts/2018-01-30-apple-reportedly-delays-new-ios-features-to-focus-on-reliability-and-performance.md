* A new report from Ina Fried over at Axios says Apple has pivoted their upcoming plans for iOS. Instead of several new features making their debut this year, Apple will put a higher priority on performance and quality, delaying the majority of new features until next year.
* According to Fried, software head Craig Federighi informed employees of the revised plan earlier this year.
* There seems to have been some big cuts to the feature list too, with an update to in-car user interface, a revised Home screen, and all new photo experiences pushed til 2019.
* The features still planned to come out later this year, include updates to ARKit, digital health, and updated parental controls. These are all features Apple has publicly announced quite recently, with many of them slated to be released in the upcoming iOS 11.3 update.
* This is always a tough call. Features are what sell devices, but Apple has also taken some significant hits lately in the quality and performance of their devices. It is probably a smart call to focus on reliability over features.
* What do you think?
