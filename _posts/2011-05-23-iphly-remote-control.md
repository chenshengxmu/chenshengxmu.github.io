* If you’ve got a remote control car, helicopter or airplane, listen up. The iPhly allows you to ditch the bulky and expensive R/C equipment for something more portable, like your iPhone.
* We’ve seen remote control accessories before, but they only work with accompanying vehicles. iPhly actually has the ability to control anything from airplanes to RC cars that you already own. How does it work?
* The iPhly connects to your iPhone via the accessory port. The device uses a pre existing frequency module, or you can purchase one along with the product. The developer notes that iPhly is compatible with thousands of different R/C models.
* The accompanying iPhone app allows you to control your R/C vehicle with touch screen and motion controls. You can even save remote control settings and take pictures of each one of your R/C vehicles to identify each profile.
* The product is a direct result of a recently funded Kickstarter project and the inventor must still be fulfilling pre-orders, as the item is currently listed as out of stock.
* It amazes me what people are able to come up with. I’ve always wanted an R/C car or airplane to dink around with, and something like this would certainly make the hobby easier to pick up.
* What do you think of iPhly?
