* This past weekend, a trio of nicely done new videos appeared on Apple’s Brazilian YouTube channel, titled “Selfies on iPhone X” and similar to its larger “Shot on iPhone” series” campaign.
* Featuring Steven Stamkos, an NHL all-star and the captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning, the newly released spots celebrate the annual Brazilian Carnival, or Carnaval do Brasil, which begins on the afternoon of February 9 and runs through February 14, 2018.
* One of the clips features Moraes Moreira and IZA.
* The roughly translated tagline would read something along the lines of “The biggest party in Brazil is even more beautiful in selfies shot on your iPhone X.”
* Check them out right below.

* As evidenced by the image top of post, Carnival-themed graphics has taken over Apple’s Brazilian homepage, linked to a dedicated microsite which shows off selfies taken using the dramatic Stage Light effect available in Portrait Lightning shooting mode on iPhone X.
* The campaign will extend to billboards in major cities across the world over the coming weeks. NHL all-star Steven Stamkos announced his participation in the campaign on Twitter.

* Apple last week shared a similar “Selfies on iPhone X” video in the US, featuring a poem narrated by Muhammad Ali, which you can watch embedded right below.
* And earlier in the month, the Cupertino tech giant pushed out a commercial focused on Portrait Lightning shooting mode on iPhone X, titled “A New Light.”
* Last year, Apple released a similarly-themed video for the Brazilian Carnival that showcased iPhone 7 Plus’s Portrait shooting mode amid a broader shift towards local digital and social media campaigns and away from translating TV-focused campaigns for global markets.
* How do you like these new “Selfies on iPhone X” spots so far?
