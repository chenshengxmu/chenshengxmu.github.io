* Circulate is a new jailbreak tweak that brings new animation styles to the stock Clock app icon. Circulate is a great looking tweak that comes bundled with two themes out of the box. The themes, which consist of a circular theme and a bar-graph looking theme, allow you to measure time in two unique ways.
* After installing Circulate, you can configure its look via the preferences in the stock Settings app. I was highly impressed by how responsive the tweak’s settings were, and how none of the changes required a respring.
* Both the Concentric Circles theme and the Rising Bars theme can be color customized, and each customization changes dynamically based on the current theme selected. For example, with the Rising Bars theme, you are limited to changing the bar color and bar background color for the seconds, minutes, and hours bars. With the Concentric Circles theme, the customization options change to include things like ring width and radius.

* I also really appreciate the inclusion of a “reset settings to default” option. I can’t tell you how many developers omit such a simple, yet vital option, but it’s included with Circulate.

* Circulate is available for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and I deem it to be a great value. It’s a unique tweak that allows you to theme the stock Clock app icon with two really cool built-in themes. Here’s hoping that we will see more theme packs in the future.
* What do you think about Circulate?
