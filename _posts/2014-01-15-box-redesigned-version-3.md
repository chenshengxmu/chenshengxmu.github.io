* Popular cloud storage service Box has released a big update for its iOS client today, bringing the app to version 3.0. The update includes an all-new UI design, real-time search for files and within files, and a number of other improvements.
* As for the redesign, Box says it has completely re-written the app from the ground-up with things like speed and easier navigation in mind. In version 3.0, documents render faster, photos load quicker, and sharing is much less painful…
* Here are the release notes for 3.0:
* ・Completely re-written app! ・New navigation and redesigned UI ・New preview experience for documents, photos and videos ・Faster document rendering and photo loading ・Real-time search (for files and within files) ・Better sharing and controls ・AirPrint, Bookmarks, and savings videos from Box to your library coming in future releases
* And here’s a promo clip for the redesign:
* To sweeten the deal, Box says it’s giving out 50GB of free, lifetime storage space to anyone who downloads the new app within the next 30 days. That’s 5 times the amount of space it typically gives users, and 25 times what Dropbox offers for free.
* Current Box users should be happy about today’s big update, and the free 50GB offer should be enough to entice new users to check it out. If you’re looking for it, you can find the Box app in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
