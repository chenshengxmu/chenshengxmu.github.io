* So you’ve got yourself a nice new iPad 2, what do you do next? While some folks moan at the mention of accessories, others couldn’t live with out them. I’ve got a protective case on both my iPad and my iPhone 4.
* I’ve dropped either device multiple times, and can’t imagine what the outcome would have been, had they not been protected. You may not need a car charger, but I always recommend some sort of case.
* Some users only need light protection, like an InvisibleShield. There is a lot to be said for the thin, scratch-proof protection of the Zagg product. But what if you need more protection than just a thin layer of plastic?
* While there are dozens of heavy duty cases and sleeves, none of them can take a beating like the Extreme Sleeve for the iPad. We’ve seen the prototype soft-shell sleeve protect an iPad from an 8lb bowling ball, but the guys over at G-Form couldn’t stop there.
* Today they uploaded a video of their Extreme Sleeve’s latest feat, which involves a 500 ft. drop out of an airplane. You’ve got to watch the video for yourself, I can’t believe the iPad survives the drop.
* The company most known for their line of extreme sports protective gear, is venturing into the consumer electronics accessory game with this soft-shell sleeve for the iPad. Although not currently available, they are accepting pre-orders and expect to start shipping May 2nd.
* What do you think? What’s your heavy-duty case of choice?
