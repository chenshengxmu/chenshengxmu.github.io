* As many of you know, Tim Cook participated in a rare public interview last night at AllThingsD’s D11 conference. Speaking with the site’s Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, the CEO talked about a number of topics, including Apple’s interest in wearable computers and iOS 7.
* We’ve already covered several aspects of the lengthy discussion with a thorough recap, including a few video clips, and a top 15 list of the most interesting points. But for those of you who just can’t get enough of Cook’s comments, the entire interview has just been posted…
* For your viewing pleasure, here’s the full 1 hour and 21 minute interview (obviously via AllThingsD):
* It’s interesting that the full video was posted so quickly. It seems like last year, the site waited a few weeks to release the full Tim Cook interview. Perhaps this year’s talk was more popular, or just received more coverage from other tech media, prompting them to post it early.
* Either way, it’s worth watching. As we’ve said previously, Cook doesn’t reveal any new products, but he does talk more in-depth than you’d think he would about some interesting topics, and even makes a major announcement regarding Apple’s plans to make iOS more open.
* Let us know what you think about Tim Cook’s interview in the comments below.
