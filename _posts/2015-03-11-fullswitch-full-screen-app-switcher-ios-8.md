* Do you think that the App Switcher preview cards in iOS are too small? If so, then FullSwitch, a release that brings a full screen App Switcher to iOS 8, might be just the tweak to scratch your itch.
* Along with the full screen App Switcher, FullSwitch brings privacy mode, customizable multitasking indicators, and a special Home screen menu to iOS 8. We’ve taken FullSwitch for a walkthrough on video, so check it out.
* After installing FullSwitch, you can toggle its effects on or off via the Settings app. The tweak’s preference setup is concise, clear, and isn’t intimidating like many jailbreak releases tend to be. There are only a few options available in FullSwitch’s preferences, which works to the tweak’s advantage for getting setup fast.
* FullSwitch features a Multitasking indicator, which consists of two arrows on opposite sides of the screen. Although these indicators aren’t the most beautiful things from a design perspective, I suggest leaving them on, as otherwise it’s hard to tell when the App Switcher is open. You can always customize the location of the indicators if you don’t want them to be front and center on the screen.

* The privacy mode contained in FullSwitch is geared towards keeping the information on each App Switcher card obscured. This is accomplished by means of a blur effect, but I find that the effect isn’t substantial enough to provide real privacy. It’s easy to make out what’s behind the blur if you look hard enough.
* Lastly, there’s a Home screen menu option. This option allows you to swipe up on the Home screen App Switcher card to reveal another menu of quick toggles. These toggles let you close all apps, reboot, or respring.
* FullSwitch is a well laid-out tweak with a purpose. It brings a full screen App Switcher to iOS 8 without a lot of extra fluff. Best of all, it’s free on the BigBoss repo. What do you think?
