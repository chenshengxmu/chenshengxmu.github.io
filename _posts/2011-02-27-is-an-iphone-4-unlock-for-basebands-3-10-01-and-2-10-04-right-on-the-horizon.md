* If you’ve been using an iPhone 4 on basebands 3.10.01 or 2.10.04, your inability to unlock has undoubtedly been an issue of great concern.
* Time and time again, we get our hopes up, only to come away disappointed.
* Let’s give Apple credit, they’ve done a decent job with keeping these basebands locked down for a significant amount of time, but the gates could be breached in the very near future…

* Self proclaimed iPhone baseband hacker, and neurosurgeon (quite the combination) @sherif_hashim says he has an unlock working for both basebands.
* Although there has been previous reports that an unlock was being worked on, it was stated by @MuscleNerd and others that said unlock would not see the light of day until iOS 4.3 was released.
* Since iOS 4.3 might be available as early as Wednesday, this bodes well for those of you who have been salivating over an iPhone 4 unlock for these particular basebands.
* Remember, if you have an iPhone 4 and your baseband is still on 1.59.00 (unlikely, but certainly possible), you can unlock today using UltraSn0w.
* Are you a believer? Do you think we’ll see an unlock soon for these basebands?
