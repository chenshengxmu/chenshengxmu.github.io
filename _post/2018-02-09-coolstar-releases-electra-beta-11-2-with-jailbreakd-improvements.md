* CoolStar released beta 11-2 of the Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 on Friday. This update doesn’t add any new features per se, but it does include several bug fixes and stability enhancements.
* Citing the official Electra web page, beta 11-2 makes jailbreakd significantly more reliable. The full changelog is available below:
* In a series of Tweets shared Friday evening, CoolStar elucidated how specific jailbreak tweaks wouldn’t work correctly due to how jailbreakd injected itself in previous betas. Fortunately, beta 11-2 fixes that problem and makes the jailbreakd injection process “as stable as it can get.”

* For those wondering, Electra beta 11-2 doesn’t incorporate the patched Cydia app yet, but a future beta of the tool will after everything undergoes sufficient field-testing. Three of Cydia’s dependencies have been updated with iOS 11 compatibility this week, so it shouldn’t be long now.
* Notably, Saurik says he’s working on an official iOS 11 update for both Cydia and Mobile Substrate, but there’s no clear indication concerning when they might surface.
* If you’re interested in giving Electra a try, you can download the latest version from the official web page.
* Have you jailbroken with Electra yet? Let us know in the comments below.
