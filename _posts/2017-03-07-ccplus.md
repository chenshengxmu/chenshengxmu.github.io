* Control Center made iOS devices more usable after debuting post-iOS 7, as it allows you tinker with settings and shortcuts without ever having to open an app to do so. On the other hand, Apple still doesn’t give the user even the most basic of customization options, which leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately, the jailbreak community picks up the slack in this department.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak called CCPlus by iOS developer Skitty, you can configure the look and feel of Control Center so it reflects what you want, rather than what Apple expects it to be.
* CCPlus brings a lot of features to iOS, including the ability to colorize the interface and hide/show certain things from the UI. Because everything is customizable, your mileage may vary from what you’re seeing in the screenshot examples in this post.
* What is nice, however, is the way the tweak affects both pages of Control Center, whether you’re looking at the toggles or the Now Playing page with all of your music information. This adds a degree of consistency to your customization:

* After you install CCPlus, you can open the Settings app and you’ll find a treasure trove of new options in the tweak’s preferences pane:

* Because there’s so much you can do here, we’ll give you a brief outline of what can be done below:
* These options give you enough leeway to hide the things you never use from Control Center, as well as change its color to anything you want it to be. Since some might not like customizing Control Center to have a single static color, it’s also great how the developer includes the option to color Control Center based on any Now Playing music, as it offers a more dynamic option.
* If you’re interested in giving CCPlus a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is only intended to run on jailbroken iOS 10 devices, so ensure you have the requirements prior to attempting to install it.
