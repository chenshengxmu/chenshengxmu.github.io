* Developer AgileBits has updated its password manager for iPhone and iPad, 1Password, with support for Markdown styling in secure notes that was added to the Mac app back in March. The update brings other perks as well, including stickers for your iMessage conversations.
* With Markdown support, your secure notes in 1Password can now use styling like bold, italics, underline, ordered and unordered lists and more. In addition, you can even add tappable links to your secure notes, bringing feature-parity with the Mac app on terms of secure notes.
* 1Password 7.1 for iOS now ships with an accompanying iMessage app with a bunch 1Password-themed stickers that you an use in your 1Message conversations. You must manually enable the iMessage extension by tapping More in the Messages app tray.
* Two of the most prevalent bugs have been squashed: searching no longer returns broken or incorrect results and creating a new item no longer causes 1Password to become unresponsive.
* Here’s everything new, improved and fixed in 1Password’s 7.1 update
* 1Password for iOS is a freemium download from App Store with advanced features such as web access and multi-device sync locked behind subscription tiers: $3.99 per month for individuals or $6.99 per month for a family of 5.
* 1Password for Mac is also a freemium download, with optional in-app subscriptions.
