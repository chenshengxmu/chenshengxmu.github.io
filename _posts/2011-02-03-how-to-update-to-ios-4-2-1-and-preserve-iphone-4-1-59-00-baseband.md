title: How to Update to iOS 4.2.1 and Preserve iPhone 4 1.59.00 Baseband
---
* Now that Greenpois0n RC5 finally provides the long awaited iOS 4.2.1 untethered jailbreak (without the need of SHSH Blobs), many iPhone 4 owners with unlocked iPhones’ have been told to hold off upgrading to 4.2.1 as you will lose the ability to unlock (for now).

* But thanks to TinyUmbrella developer @notcom, there is now a way to upgrade to iOS 4.2.1 without upgrading your baseband. Unfortunately, currently you will only be able to unlock your iPhone 4 on the older 1.59.00 baseband (modem firmware). So if you are not on the older baseband, you will not be able to unlock your iPhone 4.
* For those of you with the older 1.59.00 baseband, follow the guide below to preserve your iPhone 4 baseband and unlock and jailbreak your iPhone 4 on iOS 4.2.1…
* Note: If you are unsure as to what baseband your iPhone 4 is on, launch Settings > General > About  > Modem Firmware.
* Step 1: Download TinyUmbrella from here
* Step 2: Connect your iPhone 4 & Launch TinyUmbrella
* Step 3: Click On the “Save SHSH” button
* Step 4: Now, Click on start the “TSS Server” button
* Step 5: While the TSS server is running, Launch iTunes
* Step 6: Now, Click on Restore in iTunes (Don’t Click on Update)
* Step 7: During the Restore Process, iTunes will give you Error 1013. Don’t panic, this is good. This error means your baseband has been preserved. Exit out of iTunes.
* Step 8: Next, jailbreak your iPhone 4 with Greenpois0n RC5 (follow our tutorial here). This will jailbreak your iPhone 4 as well as kick it out of Recovery Mode.
* Step 9: Because Greenpois0n does not support hacktivation, you will need to find an official SIM card (doesn’t need to be activated), insert it in the iPhone 4 and connect to iTunes. This will bring you to the homescreen. Once you are on the homescreen, you will no longer need the official SIM card.
* Step 10: Follow our tutorial here to unlock your iPhone 4 on baseband 1.59.00.
* All done! Enjoy your unlocked and jailbroken iPhone 4 on iOS 4.2.1!
