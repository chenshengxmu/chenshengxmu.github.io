* The much talked-about feature called Single Sign-On now appears to be live and available to the public. You can access it by navigating to Settings > TV Provider on iPhone and Settings > Accounts > TV Provider > Sign In on Apple TV.
* While you should see the new feature, not everyone will be able to take advantage of it at this time. Support is currently limited to 8 providers: CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GTA, Hotwire, Hawaiian Telecom, MetroCast, and Sling TV.

* For those unfamiliar with Single Sign-On, its purpose is to streamline the streaming experience. Without it, if you install apps like AMC or WatchESPN that require cable credentials, you have to log into each one individually. This is one-and-done.
* Not all apps have been updated to work with Single Sign-On yet, but the App Store has a handy section highlighting those that are currently compatible. And Apple today added support for more service providers, so we’ll keep an eye on that as well.
