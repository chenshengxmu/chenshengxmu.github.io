* Starting with iOS 10, some iPhone models now have a new feature called Raise to Wake, which like the name suggests, wakes the screen when you grab your device. This feature is only available on newer iPhones, including iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 7.
* Those of you who don’t like this new way of quickly accessing the Lock screen can easily disable that in the Settings app. We’ll show you where.
* But first, you have to ask yourself why you’d want to turn off this feature. Admittedly, like any change, it takes a bit of getting used to, and after using it after a few hours, you’ll start seeing the benefits. My suggestion is for you to first give it a good try, and if you end up not liking this new feature, then of course, go ahead and turn it off.
* If you’re concerned about Raise to Wake using too much battery, I think you can rest assured that the sensors used to detect the raise gesture of the device have been configured to avoid any false positives, such as when the phone is in your pocket or when it is in a purse, or backpack. That said, Raise to Wake should have no noticeable impact on your battery life, although the conspiracy theorists of battery life, will most likely disagree with me…
* 1) Launch the Settings app on your iPhone.
* 2) Navigate to the Display & Brightness section.
* 3) Toggle off the Raise to Wake option.
* Going forward, the only way to wake your iPhone will be by pressing the Home button, or the Power button, effectively returning things to the way they were pre-iOS 10.
* Obviously, if you want to enable Raise to Wake again, then follow the same directions and press the toggle again to turn it on.
* Have you had a chance to experience Raise to Wake yet on your device? If so, what do you think of this new feature?
