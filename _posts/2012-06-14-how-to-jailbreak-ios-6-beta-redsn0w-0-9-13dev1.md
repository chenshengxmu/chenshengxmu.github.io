* Earlier today, the iPhone Dev Team released RedSn0w 0.9.13dev1 to jailbreak the iOS 6 beta on certain iOS devices. Because this jailbreak is obviously aimed at developers only, the process and the results are a tad bit different that normal.
* If you’re a developer, and you have an iPhone 4, 3GS, or iPod touch 4th generation running iOS 6 beta, then step inside as we showcase how to jailbreak with this development version of RedSn0w.
* Note: This is aimed at developers only. Again, this will not install Cydia on your device, will not hacktivate, and it’s suggested that unlockers who want to preserve the baseband, stay away. This only works with iPhone 4, 3GS, and iPod touch 4th gen. No A5 Devices. This is a tethered jailbreak.
* Step 1: Download and open RedSn0w 0.9.13dev1.
* Step 2: Click Extras > Select IPSW, and point to your iOS 6 firmware file for your device.
* Step 3: Click back and Click jailbreak. Place your device into DFU mode, and the jailbreak should begin. RedSn0w will prompt you to Install SSH. Make sure that option is checked, and click Next. the jailbreak will proceed until completion.
* Step 4: Once on your Home screen, go back to RedSn0w and click Extras > Just boot. This will perform a tethered boot. You will need to place your device into DFU mode again to proceed.
* Step 5: Once the tethered boot is completed, your device will go back to your Home screen. Congratulations, your device is now jailbroken. You can now use SSH, or another iPhone file navigation utility to browse the default file structure. This may allow you to install apps and tweaks manually if need be. Again, this is for advanced users only, as no GUI interface is there to help you through this process.
* Have you successfully jailbroken iOS 6 on your device yet?
