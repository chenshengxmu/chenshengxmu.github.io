* Apple has released iOS 4.3.5 for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. This update is now available in iTunes and fixes an apparent security vulnerability with certificate validation.
* iOS 4.3.5 can be applied to your iDevice by updating your software in iTunes.
* Jailbreakers are obviously warned to stay away from this update, or else you will lose your jailbreak.
* We do expect the Dev Team to release an update to RedSn0w that will allow for a tethered jailbreak as they’ve done previously, but the untethered jailbreak has been killed by Apple.
* For that reason, we advise anyone who really cares about their jailbreaking abilities to stay far away from iOS 4.3.5. It’s a relatively minor update anyway.
* For CDMA iPhone users, Apple has released iOS 4.2.10.
* All latest firmwares can be downloaded from our download section.
* Thoughts on Apple’s consistent flow of iOS updates?
