* Twelve South is at it again, making great accessories for Apple products. The company’s release of the HiRise 2 and HiRise 2 Deluxe charging docks earlier this month brought forth a redesign with new color options and improved stability for larger devices.
* In this review, we’ll take a closer look at the HiRise 2 Deluxe in black, a color made to match Apple’s new black iPhone 7 & 7 Plus finish.
* So what’s new in the second generation HiRise? Twelve South has updated the design with rounder curves that go along nicely with those on the iPhone 6 and later. Gone are the boxy corners that shipped on the previous generation HiRise.
* Moreover, the base of the dock has been given double the weight of the original to make it more stable for larger handsets, including the iPhone 7 Plus and even the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.
* The Deluxe model is the same as the regular model, except that MFi-certified Lightning and micro-USB cables are included in the box so you don’t have to sacrifice one of your OEM Apple Lightning cables to use it (micro-USB is for Android phones, if you have one).

* A cover on the bottom of the HiRise 2 comes off to let you snake the cable through and lock it in place with one of the included locks. Each lock allows the tip of the cable to stick out a certain amount to compensate for any cases you might be using.

* Once you set the cable in, you can install the back plate, which is a support with a small rubber boot on it for your iPhone or iPad that prevents the device from moving while you tap on the screen. You can adjust how far back you want the back plate to be and then tighten it into place with the hand screw.

* The anodized texture of the HiRise 2 feels virtually the same as the finishes of of Apple’s latest iPhones, except for the jet black version, which is glossy instead of matte. The materials feel just as premium as the ones used to build your handset, so it feels almost like an Apple product.
* On the other side of things, the HiRise 2 isn’t quite as heavy as the Grovemade dock we showed you last month, so you do have to hold down on the base of the HiRise 2 to undock your iPhone or iPad, or else the whole dock comes off of the table with it.
* Here’s a short list of pros and cons we’ve put together for the Twelve South HiRise 2 Deluxe dock:
* Pros:
* Cons:
* If you’re interested in picking up a HiRise 2 for yourself, you can pick up the regular version for $39.99, or the Deluxe version for $59.99.
