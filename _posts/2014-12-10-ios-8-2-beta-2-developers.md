* Apple this morning posted the second beta of iOS 8.2 for developers. The release comes nearly three weeks after the first 8.2 beta, and follows yesterday’s public launch of iOS 8.1.2, which brought about a fix for disappearing ringtones.
* The new 8.2 beta can be downloaded either over-the-air, or via Apple’s developer portal, by all registered iOS developers. It’s unknown what new features the firmware will bring, but beta one enabled support for Apple’s WatchKit platform.
* We’re installing the beta now and will pass along any notable changes we come across. If you see something we’ve missed, feel free to email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a note in the comments section below regarding the change.
