* Yes, for those wondering, the new MacBook Pro has a standard headphone jack. Apple was met with a lot of criticism back in September when it introduced the iPhone 7 without the 3.5mm port, but it clearly isn’t ready to bring the change to its laptop lines.
* The move should appease the MacBook Pro’s targeted audience, who won’t have to worry about fiddling with adapters or pairing Bluetooth headphones/speakers. Music producers, for example, will be able to plug the computer directly into their current setups.
* This does provide a new challenge, however: how do you plug your Lightning headphones into the new MacBook Pro? It’s not clear if Apple plans to make such an adapter (it makes a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter), but if not, surely third party companies will step up.
* Finally, though Apple chose not to omit the headphone jack, it didn’t have a problem axing plenty of other ports. There is no longer a MagSafe connector for charging or any traditional USB ports, as they’ve been replaced by USB-C ports, and there is no SD card reader.
* Apple’s new MacBook Pro starts at $1,499 and is available for order starting today.
