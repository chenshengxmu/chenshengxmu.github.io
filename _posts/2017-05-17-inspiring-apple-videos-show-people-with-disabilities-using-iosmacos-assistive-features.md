* Happy Global Accessibility Awareness Day, everyone!
* To mark the occasion Apple is showcasing a series of more than half a dozen inspiring videos of some of its users with different disabilities, who can be seen leveraging the powerful assistive technologies built into macOS and iOS to make their lives easier.
* The clips, first spotted by Jim Dalrymple of The Loop, demonstrate real-world usage of iOS and macOS accessibility features by the people who can’t move, talk, see or hear. The company is also hosting a bunch of accessibility-related sessions in its stores around the world.
* Carlos is the lead singer, drummer and PR manager for his metal band Distartica. Using VoiceOver, with Screen Curtain on iPhone, he can hail a ride, take a photo and get the word out about his band’s album release while keeping his screen entirely black.
* Ian is an outdoor and birding enthusiast. With Siri on iPhone, he can play a bird call or chat with a friend via FaceTime, and with Switch Control he is able to capture the perfect waterfall photo.
* Meera is a teenager who loves soccer and jokes. She uses TouchChat on iPad to talk with her friends and family, and deliver the occasional one-liner.
* Andrea is a nursing student and advocate for the disabled community. She uses Apple Watch to record wheelchair-specific workouts and share her victories with friends.
* Patrick is a DJ and producer with a passion for music and excellent food. With VoiceOver, he has the freedom to express himself in his home studio with Logic Pro X and in the kitchen with TapTapSee.
* Shane is a middle school band and choir director who uses Made for iPhone hearing aids in her classroom so she can hear every note.
* Todd is the CEO of a technology consulting company and a prominent member of the quadriplegic community. With Siri, Switch Control, and the Home app, he can open his front door, adjust the lights in his house, and queue up a party playlist.
* Apple provided these links for the technologies and apps featured in the videos:
* Today, May 18, marks the sixth Global Accessibility Awareness Day.
* According to the official Global Accessibility Awareness Day website, the purpose of the initiative is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access and inclusion of people with different disabilities.
