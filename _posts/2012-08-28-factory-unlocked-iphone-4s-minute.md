* Recently, I’ve been interested in factory unlocking my still on-contract iPhone 4S. I’d heard of various services over the past few months, but never really investigated them until recently.
* After asking around on Twitter, I stumbled upon Cellular Medic — one of many services available online that claims to be able to factory unlock the iPhone for a fee.
* I was pleasantly surprised that the entire unlock process took a mere 10 minutes. I went from an iPhone 4S locked to AT&T, to a permanently unlocked iPhone 4S that’s usable on virtually any GSM carrier. Take a look inside for a video walkthrough documenting the experience…
* For the record, let me just say that there are many unlocking services available on the web, but Cellular Medic promised to have my iPhone unlocked within a very small amount of time — generally within 10 minutes using their “Instant” service. Granted, they did perform this unlocking service free of charge for me, as a means to test it out, but this should be fairly indicative as to what you can expect if you use their service.
* Cellular Medic charges $75 for their “Instant” unlock, and $60 for their unlock within 24 hours. Again, there are other options out there on the web, and many on eBay that have a good reputation. Many times, you may even be able find similar services for even cheaper than what Cellular Medic offers.
* Their process works like this for AT&T customers:
* If you’re locked to another carrier besides AT&T, you still may be able to unlock; check their website, or contact them to verify. To find your IMEI number, open up the phone app, and dial the following code: *#06#
* If you have an iPhone 4S, it’s as simple as popping out the current SIM, and replacing it with a SIM from another carrier. The iPhone will automatically go through the activation process.
* If you have an iPhone 4, you will need to perform a backup, and then restore. During the setup process, your device will activate the SIM card from the alternate carrier(s).
* The great thing about a factory unlock is that it is permanent, and requires no jailbreaks, special SIM cards, etc. It just works.
* Again, check around the web, and perhaps even eBay, and see what works for you. Though, I can say that I’ve personally used Cellular Medic, and recommend them; they lived up to their claims.
* Right now is probably a great time to start considering a factory unlock for your iPhone 4S, especially if you plan on selling it to get the next iPhone. For a small up-front investment, a factory unlock will command much more resale value on eBay or Craigslist.
* Have you considered factory unlocking your on-contract iPhone? Have you already done so? Which service did you use, and how much did it cost? Sound off with your thoughts in the comments below.
