* After seeding iOS 10.2.1 beta 1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 1 to members of the Apple Developer Program yesterday, Apple today released versions of these software updates for public beta-testing. If you sign up at the Apple Beta Software Program website to become a beta tester and install an appropriate configuration profile on your device, you too will be able to install the first beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.3 on your Mac and take iOS 10.2.1 for a spin on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* After the configuration profile has been installed on your device (follow the instructions on the Apple Beta Software Program website), head over to Settings → General → Software Update on your iOS device, or launch the Mac App Store’s Updates tab on your Mac, and the public beta should appear as an over-the-air download.
* iOS 10.2.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 are maintenance updates so we’re not expecting any new outward-facing user features. The recently-launched iOS 10.2, on the other hand, brought out more than a dozen new iPhone and iPad features.
* Give them a quick watch in Andrew’s hands-on video embedded below, if you want.
* watchOS 3.1.1 was pulled yesterday following bricking complaints. As for tvOS 10.1.1, which was also seeded to developers yesterday, it’s off limits to the general public because tvOS and watchOS betas are unavailable through Apple’s beta program.
