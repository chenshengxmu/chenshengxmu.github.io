* As part of alleged iPhone 8 technical drawings that were leaked out at the start of this week by iFanr, the publication also commissioned some interesting mockups. The nicely done renderings attempt to envision so-called “Tenth Anniversary iPhone” (aka “iPhone X”) with a seamless edge-to-edge display stretching across almost the entire front face of the device. Without further ado, this is what iPhone X with what iFanr dubbed “Full Vision Display” could look like.
* Here’s what an iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch screen in a 4.7-inch bezel-less body might look like in one’s hand.

* As we explained Monday, the alleged technical drawings shared by iFanr suggest that a nearly fullscreen iPhone model is likely among ten prototypes Apple’s reportedly testing this year.

* The schematics depict the sensors, the FaceTime camera, the Home button, Touch ID and other components as being integrated into the display assembly, leaving only a tiny physical slit within the OLED display at the top for the embedded earpiece.

* Galaxy S8 has its stunning Infinity Display (great marketing name, by the way!) while iPhones have been stuck with good ol’ Retina displays since 2010.

* That said, I’m not so sure about iFanr’s “Full Vision Display” moniker.
* Thankfully, the expected adoption of edge-to-edge OLED displays on future iPhones will surely present Apple with ample opportunity to update the Retina moniker, if it wants to.
* When iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus came along, Apple referred to their screens as “Retina HD” due to the increased pixel count going all the way up to the full HD resolution of 1,080×1,920 pixels on Plus models.

* So, what could the company call iPhone 8’s rumored 2,436×1,125 521 PPI screen?
* Super Retina HD? Ultra Retina HD, perhaps? Or something entirely different?
* Tell us in comments!
