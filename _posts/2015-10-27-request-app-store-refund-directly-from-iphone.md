* Contrary to popular belief, it is possible, and relatively easy I might add, to request refunds for purchases made on the App Store. This includes both in-app purchases and regular app purchases.
* Refunds on the App Store aren’t automatic, and require approval by an iTunes Support Advisor. With this in mind, it’s best to use refund requests sparingly. In my history with the App Store, I’ve probably requested a refund twice, not including today’s request, which brings the total number up to three.
* It’s also possible to request your refund directly from your iPhone, which makes it super easy to initiate and complete the request as soon as you recognize you’re not satisfied with a purchase. In the post that follows, we’ll show you every step involved.
* Step 1: go to Apple’s Report a Problem website and log in.

* Step 2: locate the purchase associated with the app that you want refunded, and tap Report.

* Step 3: select a reason for your refund request via the Choose Problem drop-down box. Note: in some regions, you may have an “I wish to cancel this purchase option,” in which case, you should use this option, which will expedite the refund process.

* Step 4: type an explanation for your issue indicating why you want a refund, and tap Submit.

* You’ll see a message stating that an iTunes Support Advisor will contact you within 48 hours via your Apple ID email address.
* Now, it’s just a matter of waiting until the iTunes Support Advisor contacts you. In most cases, you should receive a refund. Again, be sure not to abuse this provision, and you shouldn’t have any issues with the occasional refund for an app that just doesn’t meet your expectations, doesn’t work, or doesn’t meet your needs.
* For the record, we did not request a refund for Pixelmator, which is a great app.
