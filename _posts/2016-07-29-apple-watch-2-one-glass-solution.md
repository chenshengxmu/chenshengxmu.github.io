* Aside from other rumored hardware improvements, a second-generation Apple Watch should ditch the current Glass on Glass (G/G) Retina touchscreen and replace it with a thinner and lighter display based on so-called One Glass Solution (OGS) screen technology, according to Apple supplier TPK Holding cited Friday by Taiwan’s infamous hit-and-miss trade publication DigiTimes.
* Because OGS eliminates a layer, adopting the technology should help the Apple Watch 2 conserve space and potentially even accommodate a larger battery.
* It must be noted that TPK also warned investors about various technical issues, including lower-than-anticipated yield rates for the new Apple Watch’s OSG solution which could result in limited launch availability of the Apple Watch 2.
* “The change in touch panel technology involved unexpected technological difficulties and therefore yield rates for OGS touch panels were much lower than expected,” TPK explained.
* As mentioned, the Apple Watch currently uses Glass-On-Glass display technology which sandwiches the device’s flexible OLED touchscreen between a capacitive stack of materials, including two pieces of glass.
* Apple Watch 2 is expected to be thinner and more waterproof than existing models and powered by a speedier, power-sipping ‘S2’ processor with more RAM to make multitasking and everyday operations smoother.
* The device may include a FaceTime camera for video chats. It’s also said to have embedded GPS and track swimming. On top of that, The Wall Street Journal predicted Apple might introduce a new model with an embedded cellular connectivity. The screen format and resolution of the Apple Watch 2 apparently won’t change.
* Supply chain sources think the Apple Watch 2 will launch in September or October.
