* Apple has finally posted the iOS 7 update for its Find My Friends application this afternoon. The app, which allows iOS users to locate friends and family members, was the last notable mobile Apple title utilizing the old skeuomorphic design language.
* In today’s update, the app’s leather stitching and paper-like textures have been replaced with open spaces and sharp text—the usual changes we’ve seen in iOS 7-flavored updates. And the UI now lines up with Apple’s other iPhone and iPad offerings…
* From the App Store description:
* “Find My Friends allows you to easily locate friends and family using your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Just install this free app and sign in with the Apple ID you use with iCloud. Adding a friend is easy — just choose from your contacts or provide an email address to send an invitation. When your friend accepts your invitation using the Find My Friends app on their device, you can start following their location. Your friends can request to follow your location the same way.”
* And here are a few more screenshots:

* Today’s release comes just under a week after Apple updated its iBooks and iTunes U applications, which followed several other iOS 7 releases. You can download the latest version of Find My Friends from the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
