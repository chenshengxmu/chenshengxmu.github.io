* Following today’s announcement of the first iPad 2 jailbreak by @Comex, iPhone hacker @i0n1c has updated us with the status of his untethered iOS 4.3 jailbreak, which was revealed late last week.
* i0n1c has  updated his original YouTube video showing off the jailbreak, with an ETA for the untethered jailbreak which he states will be released “before next weekend”…
* Because so many people are asking for an ETA:
* I am pretty sure that the untether will be released before the next weekend. I was using older kernel patches that caused lagging on the jailbroken device. I will change that and then port it to the other devices and release.
* i0n1c claims that he is working out a few bugs in the jailbreak and thanks to the help of Comex, he has fixed the lagging issues on the iPhone 4. According to i0n1c, this new exploit will be a big surprise to Apple:
* I am pretty sure the first reaction of the Apple Techs analysing my untether exploit binary will be: WTF!?!
* Also, keep in  mind, i0n1c’s untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3 will only work on iDevices that are vulnerable to the limera1n exploit, meaning that this will work on all current devices, except the iPad 2. iPad 2 owners will have to patiently wait for Comex’s jailbreak.
* It’s nice to see we’ve already got a jailbreak for iOS 4.3 coming sometime before next weekend and another one just around the corner! Wouldn’t you agree?
