* Apple on Wednesday seeded the first betas of iOS 11.4.1, macOS 1013.6, watchOS 4.3.2 and tvOS 11.4.1.Registered developers can download the new betas through Apple’s developer center, or they can install them using each platform’s respective OTA mechanism.
* The releases come just a day after Apple launched iOS 11.4 and other updates to the public, and less than a week before the company’s big WWDC keynote address. Given that time frame, we are expecting these betas to feature small security and bug-related fixes.
* Nevertheless, we are installing the new software and will be sure to report back with any notable changes or major findings. And as usual, if you see something worth mentioning that you think we’ve missed, be sure to let us know about it down in the comments below.
