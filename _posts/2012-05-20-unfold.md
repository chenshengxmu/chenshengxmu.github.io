* A few days ago, Russian freelance designer, Anton Kudin, created a new “fold to unlock” concept for the iPhone. Needless to say, his concept turned out to be a pretty big hit.
* Unsurprisingly, given the history of the jailbreak community’s fast turnaround time, Kudin’s concept has been turned into a reality.
* This afternoon I had the privilege to sit down and test out an unreleased version of Unfold, a new jailbreak tweak from German jailbreak developer Jonas Gessner. Unfold, as you might have guessed, is a usable implementation of the fold to unlock concept.
* Want to see Unfold in action? Then step right inside…
* Once installed, Unfold simply works. It doesn’t require any settings configuration, and it plays nice with iOS’ passcode security feature. Unfold is a solid implementation of an interesting concept, and it’s sure to make anyone unfamiliar with jailbreaking do a double take.
* As stated, Unfold is still in development, but it’s slated to be released in the very near future for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Do you like what you see?
