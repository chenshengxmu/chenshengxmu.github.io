* T-Mobile’s AT&T deal might not have gone through, but that doesn’t mean the carrier is ready to just roll over and die. It’s actually been very busy this year, building up its network.
* The company has already started showing off its new iPhone-friendly HSPA+ technology. And today it’s announced plans to purchase a large amount of AWS spectrum from Verizon…
* From the carrier’s press release:
* “Today, T-Mobile USA, Inc. announced an agreement with Verizon Wireless for the purchase and exchange of certain Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum licenses in 218 markets across the U.S. The transaction will improve T-Mobile’s spectrum position in 15 of the top 25 markets in the U.S. by providing an opportunity for T-Mobile both to acquire addition AWS spectrum and realign its existing spectrum holdings. Following regulatory approval, this spectrum can be promptly deployed to enhance the company’s 4G mobile broadband service, including the rollout of LTE service next year.”
* The AWS spectrum is of the 1700MHz variety, so it won’t necessarily help the carrier with its ‘make our network more iPhone-friendly’ project. But it will, as the company points out, help with its eventual LTE rollout — which could help it in its bid to carry Apple’s next handset.
* Regardless, this is a huge move for T-Mobile, provided it goes through. You see, all of this rests on the fact that Verizon’s bid to purchase spectrum from Cox Cable and a few other cable companies gets approved by the FCC. Otherwise, it’s not licensing anything out.
* How do you like that? T-Mobile’s fate is once again in the hands of the Federal Communications Commission.
