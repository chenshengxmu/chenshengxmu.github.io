* So yeah, I was lazy. Unlike Cody, I don’t have the patience to wait on hold, or be placed in a revolving door of automated prompts. It was either head directly to the store, or give AT&T’s technical support chat a try.
* Thankfully, AT&T’s technical support chat has a pretty good track record with me; I figured I’d give that a try before deciding to burn a gallon of gas to head to the closest AT&T store. Would they even be open on a holiday anyway?
* At the end of the day, I’m glad I decided on this method. In less than 10 minutes the unlocking process for my iPhone was initiated, saving me time, gas money, and a potential headache.
* Whereas it took Cody about 20 minutes to initiate his iPhone 4 unlock, it took me less than 10 minutes. Folks, it really doesn’t get any simpler than this…
* Step 1: On your phone go to Settings > General > About > and locate your IMEI number
* Step 2: Head over to AT&T’s chat support page, (you will need to be logged in to do this). After logging in click “Chat Now” next to Technical Support.
* Step 3: fill out the chat form, and type “I want to unlock my iPhone 4” in the “How may we assist you today?” field. Click Start Chat.
* Step 4: Explain to the representative that you need to unlock your iPhone, and provide them with the IMEI number from Step 1. This will allow the representative to determine the eligibility of your iPhone unlock.
* Step 5: If your device is eligible for an unlock, the representative will ask for your email address. They will provide you with further unlock details via your email address, so make sure you typed in your email correctly. It could take a week for the unlock request to completely go through.
* The only thing left to do now is wait. Once we receive the email with the unlock code, we will provide a follow up post concluding the process.
* I know AT&T has received a lot of bad press, but I it’s pretty cool of them to finally take this stand on unlocking iPhones.
* Are you happy that AT&T has started to do this, or is it too little too late?
