* In yet another attempt to capture the nascent smartphone market in India, Apple is now promoting discounts for students. Students can receive $144 on an iPhone when they trade in their old smartphones. Apple and Samsung have engaged in a marketing struggle, both rolling out installment plans to encourage Indian buyers of rival smartphones.
* The iPhone maker also announced a cash-back deal when Indian consumers use American Express to purchase an iPhone 4, 4S or 5 before June 10, according to a Monday report…
* Apple’s latest discounts also include non-students, who will receive $130, reports ZDNet.
* The American Express cash-back offer of $111 requires the credit card be issued by an Indian bank and via installment payment plans available through local iPhone distributors Redington and Ingram Micro.
* In the case of an Indian consumer purchasing a 16GB iPhone 5, the buyer would receive $70 after paying $181.50 down and $43 per month over six months, according to the report. The report cites research firm Canalys predicting 2013 could mean growth for Apple as its installment payment concept picks up steam.
* Along with increasing the number of local partners, Apple has raised its brand awareness in India, a country that is just beginning to show interest in smartphones. India has become the focus of handset makers, such as Samsung, as other regions mature and demand slows.
* No matter how you look at it, this is a prudent move on Apple’s part and it’ll be interesting seeing whether Apple follows up with similar promotions in other emerging markets.
