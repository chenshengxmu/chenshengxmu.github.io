* Apple on Friday announced to developers that it will be performing its annual iTunes Connect shutdown for the holidays next month. The company posted the bulletin on its developer portal this afternoon, saying that it will not be accepting new app or update submissions beginning on December 22 through the 29th.
* Here’s the full announcement:
* The busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 22-29, so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect functionality will remain available.
* Because of your incredible apps, the App Store crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads. Revenue from the App Store increased 25% year over year, and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, setting a new all-time record. We want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication to our platforms.
* While this news is obviously geared towards developers, it’s noteworthy for users as well, as many will likely be receiving new Apple devices or iTunes gift cards this holiday season. You can expect a slew of app submissions over the next month, but don’t expect to find awesome new games or big updates on Christmas morning.
