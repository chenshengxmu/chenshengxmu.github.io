* Though there was no mention of it during the iPad event this morning, Apple has just released a new version of iOS. The update, which brings the firmware to 7.0.3, brings about a number of improvements.
* On the new feature front, Apple has re-added in support for iCloud Keychain. And as for bug fixes, there are several of them, including ones for iMessage, iPhone 5s sensor calibration issues, and much more…
* Here’s the monster change log for iOS 7.0.3:
* – Adds iCloud Keychain to keep track of your account names, passwords, and credit card numbers across all your approved devices – Adds Password Generator so Safari can suggest unique, hard-to-guess passwords for your online accounts – Updates lock screen to delay display of “slide to unlock” when Touch ID is in use – Adds back the ability to search the web and Wikipedia from Spotlight search – Fixes an issue where iMessage failed to send for some users – Fixes a bug that could prevent iMessage from activating – Improves system stability when using iWork apps – Fixes an accelerometer calibration issue – Addresses an issue that could cause Siri and VoiceOver to use a lower quality voice – Fixes a bug that could allow someone to bypass the Lock screen passcode – Enhances the Reduce Motion setting to minimize both motion and animation – Fixes an issue that could cause VoiceOver input to be too sensitive – Updates the Bold Text setting to also change dial pad text – Fixes an issue that could cause supervised devices to become un-supervised when updating software 
* You can find the update by either syncing your iOS device with iTunes, or opening up the Settings app on your device and navigating to General > Software Update for the OTA (over the air) download.
* Of course, if you’re just looking for direct links to the just-released firmware, you can find them on our Downloads page for all of your compatible devices including iPhones, iPads and iPod touches.
* Potential iOS7 jailbreakers should stay away from today’s 7.0.3 for now. Too early to tell if it closes anything important for JB.

* As usual, folks hoping to jailbreak iOS 7 at a later time should probably hold off on the 7.0.3 update until it has been cleared by the evad3rs, who are currently zeroing in on a working jailbreak for iOS 7.
