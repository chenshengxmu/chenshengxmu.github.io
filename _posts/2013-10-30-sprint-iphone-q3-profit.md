* Sprint, America’s third-largest wireless carrier, announced Wednesday that 1.4 million of the five million smartphones it sold during the third quarter were iPhones, of which 40 percent were to new customers.
* The iPhone sales are just under the 1.5 million Apple smartphones Sprint activated during the same period in 2012.
* The iPhone numbers have helped the carrier reduce the gap from a $398 million operating loss, rebounding from a $767 million loss during the same quarter in 2012. By comparison, Verizon Wireless, the nation’s largest carrier, announced selling about 3.9 million iPhones during the third quarter…
* Sprint said 40 percent of its iPhones were sold to new subscribers.
* The carrier also announced it had a net loss of 313,000 customers during the quarter. The carrier’s loss of 360,000 long-term contract subscribers was somewhat balanced by attracting more prepaid customers. Overall, Sprint ended the three-month period with 54.8 million customers.
* While revenue per user rose almost a nickel to $64.28, contract subscribers became more antsy with turnover rising to 1.99 percent from 1.88 percent in 2012.
* Sprint finds itself in the middle of a carrier war.
* On one side is Verizon and AT&T with the cash and marketing advantage. Nipping at Sprint’s heels is T-Mobile, who’s small size enables greater flexibility in pricing. Although, when Sprint became an iPhone supplier, the limited ranks carried a bit of cache.
* “Sprint meanwhile, bet big with its deal to carry the iPhone, but that hasn’t turned out to be a real advantage with virtually every carrier big and small offering Apple’s marquee smartphone,” CNET observes.
* Along with nine regional U.S. carriers, iPhone sales are already in the works for contract-free providers Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile. However, Sprint’s role as the little carrier that could might change soon.
* Along with getting some much-needed cash from Japan’s carrier SoftBank, the carrier also purchased Clearwire earlier this year.
