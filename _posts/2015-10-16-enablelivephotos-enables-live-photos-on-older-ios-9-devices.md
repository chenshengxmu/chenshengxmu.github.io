* If you have an older device running iOS 9, it’s possible to create Live Photos if you’re willing to jailbreak your device. EnableLivePhotos is a recently released jailbreak tweak that not only lets you take Live Photos, but lets you display Live Photos on the Lock screen as well.
* EnableLivePhotos is the best implementation of Live Photos that I’ve seen for non-iPhone 6s devices. Watch our video and see how it works.
* Once you install EnableLivePhotos, you can begin using it immediately. There are no settings or options that are necessary to configure.
* Launch the stock Camera app, and you’ll see a new Live Photos toggle button at the top of the screen while in Photo mode. Just like on the iPhone 6s, you can tap that toggle to enable or disable Live Photos on the fly.
* To take a Live Photo, simply take a picture like your normally do. Live Photos will automatically record a few moments before, and a few moments after the actual snapshot is taken. It’ll then be able to play back the full recording, resulting in the “live” aspect of Live Photos.
* To play back a Live Photo, open the Photos app, and tap and hold on a photo. The photo should begin to animate. You’ll also notice subtler animations as you swipe through a set of Live Photos.
* What’s more, EnableLivePhotos lends you Live Photo access on the Lock screen wallpaper. If you tap the Share button, and select the Use as Wallpaper option, you’ll see a Live Photo button at the bottom of the screen. To view Live Photo-enabled wallpaper, simply tap and hold on the wallpaper while on the Lock screen.
* EnableLivePhotos is an impressive recreation of Live Photos for older devices. It works almost exactly like Live Photos on the iPhone 6s. It’s certainly the best way to view and take Live Photos on a jailbroken iOS 9 device that I’ve seen thus far, and it’s free on the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think?
