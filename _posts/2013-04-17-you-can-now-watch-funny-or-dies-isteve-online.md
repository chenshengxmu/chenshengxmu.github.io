title: You can now watch Funny or Dies iSteve online
---
* Comedy web site Funny or Die originally said its satirical movie about Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs, dubbed iSteve, would arrive on April 15, but they pushed it back a bit in the wake of Boston bombing.
* The movie is now available online, as a free stream via the Funny or Die web site.
* Directed by Ryan Perez, iSteve stars Justin Long of Dodgeball and Jeepers Creepers fame, who gets to portray Steve Jobs. The general public remembers the actor thanks to his amusing depiction of the Mac character in Apple’s Mac vs. PC campaign. Other roles include Lost‘s Jorge Garcia as Steve Wozniak, James Urbaniak as Bill Gates and Michaela Watkins playing Melinda Gates…
* Check out the trailer.
* iSteve runs one hour and eighteen minutes long, nearly as long as your average feature-length flick. At any rate, this is Funny or Die’s longest video project.
* Check out this Bloomberg TV clip with iSteve producer Allison Hord discussing the creative process and how the project came to be.
*  
* If you had the time to sit through the whole thing, hopefully you’ll share your impressions about iSteve with fellow readers down in the comments.
