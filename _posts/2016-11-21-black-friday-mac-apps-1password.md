* If you or someone you know owns a Mac and could benefit from apps like 1Password or TextExpander, you’re going to want to check out this promotion from the folks at Parallels. It’s called the Black Friday Mac App Bundle, and it can save you up to 90% on 8 top-shelf Mac apps and services.
* Included in this package is Parallels Desktop 12, which allows you to run Windows and other operating systems on your Mac, the popular password management app 1Password (the latest ‘Families’ edition), and key shortcut creator TextExpander. We have a full breakdown of the apps below.
* So essentially you’re paying the $80 for Parallels Desktop 12, and getting 7 apps for free. And even if you don’t think you need Kaspersky’s Internet Security or the Hotspot VPN, apps like 1Password and TextExpander make this a special offer. Those two apps alone would run you more than $100.
* The Parallels team says the promotion is good for a week, so you have a little time to think about it, but if I were you I wouldn’t wait. While we do see these Mac app bundles fairly often, they rarely include this many widely-recognized titles. You can purchase or find more info on Parallels’ website.
