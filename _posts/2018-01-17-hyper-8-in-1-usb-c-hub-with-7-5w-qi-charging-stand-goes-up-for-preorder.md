* Like Hyper has done in the past for their highly successful USB-C accessories, they’ve taken to Kickstarter to fund their latest USB-C dock and charging hub.
* The 8-in-1 charging dock was announced back during CES, and has many features built in.
* There are 8 ports that work over a USB-C cable, including 4K HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, SD, Micro SD, 3 USB-A 3.1 ports, and USB-C PD port.
* Even better, the top doubles as a built-in wireless charging stand. It works with 5W, 7.5W, 10W, and 15W capable devices, specifically calling out support for the iPhone X and iPhone 8.
* The campaign has already easily surpassed their funding goal, like they have in the past. First deliveries are expected to customers by April of this year.

* It is worth noting any Kickstarter campaign is a risk, and you have little protection if it were to ever fall through. That said, Hyper has done this many, many times with nearly all their products and has never failed to follow through, so it is more reliable than most to back with your money.
* The new HyperDrive is available pre-order now over on Kickstarter with early-bird pricing at $79 before it goes to $159 at retail.
* Let us know if you decide to back it down in the comments below!
