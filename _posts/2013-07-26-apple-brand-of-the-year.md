* Apple may be losing smartphone and tablet marketshare, but it’s still the top brand in those categories. This, according to data from a recent US-based study on consumer brand perception by Marketing research firm Harris Interactive.
* The firm polled some 38,000 Americans regarding their perceptions of their favorite brands, and Apple came out on top in 3 categories. As a result, Harris named the company the ‘brand of the year’ for smartphones, tablets and computers…
* Here’s a note from Harris Interactive SVP Manny Flores (via VentureBeat):
* “Americans continue to give Apple brands strong ratings,” Manny Flores, an SVP at Harris Interactive, said in a statement. “What really stands out is that in all three of the categories Apple brands are measured – Computer, Tablet and Mobile Phone – its brand momentum scores are in the top 30 of all 1,500 brands evaluated in the study, showing that consumers see this as a brand of the future.”
* And here are the top lists from the 3 categories that Apple came out on top:
* Computers
* Tablets
* Smartphones
* The results shouldn’t be too surprising. On the computer front, Macs have long been increasing in marketshare in the face of declining PC sales. And let’s face it, the iPad is the iPad. As for smartphones, the iPhone continues to sell extremely well.
* Of course, this all depends on who you ask. Earlier this month, a report from YouGov’s Brand Index—who specializes in measuring brand perception—showed Apple far from receiving a ‘brand of the year’ title. In fact, it didn’t even make its Top 10.
