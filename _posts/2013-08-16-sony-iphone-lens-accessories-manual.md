* A Sony-focused blog called SonyAlphaRumors on Monday published a few interesting tidbits regarding upcoming Camera Live lens attachments for smartphones that incorporate a standalone sensor with Carl Zeiss optics and built-in processing chips, normally seen on $500 point-and-shoot cameras. Details were scarce initially, but now we’re offered additional glimpses into the the entry-level DSC-QX10 and the high-end DSC-QX100.
* Thanks to a leaked manual, we know the gadgets will include advanced features such as focus ring control and expansive storage via memory cards. Go past the fold for the full reveal…
* SonyAlphaRumors published part of the supposed manual.
* Both the DSC-QX10 and DSC-QX100 accept Sony’s Memory Stick Micro memory cards and feature a power button, reset button, microphone, multifunctional jack, indicator light, zoom lever and a dedicated shutter button.
* The more powerful DSC-QX100 also includes a ring control and both devices support belt hook/tripod and feature a built-in display panel to indicate the remaining battery charge and notify the user if the memory card is not inserted.
* The entry-level DSC-QX10 has an eighteen-megapixel CMOS sensor with a f/3.3-5.9 lens supporting 10x zoom, just like Sony’s $400 WX150 point-and-shoot Cyber-shot camera.
* The pro-grade DSC-QX100 comes outfitted with a 20.2-megapixel Exmor R sensor (the same used by the Nikon 1 system) and f/1.8 Carl Zeiss lens akin to the RX100m2, the most praised high end compact camera.
* Knowing the RX100MIII sensor and Zeiss lens sell for $600 on Amazon, the DSC-QX100 likely won’t come cheap.

* Both Camera Live accessories are said to include Wi-Fi networking, a dedicated Bionz processing chip for fast processing and attach magnetically.
* The gizmos will require Sony’s downloadable iOS or Android app to function as your iPhone basically serves as an oversized viewfinder for the more powerful Sony lens.

* The DSC-QX100 measures 62,5mm × 62,5mm × 55,5mm versus 62,4mm × 61,8mm × 33,3mm for the lower spec’d DSC-QX10. The QX100 weighs in approximately 179 grams versus 105 grams for the QX10 (both including the battery pack).
* Power consumption during shooting is rated at 1.1 Watts.
