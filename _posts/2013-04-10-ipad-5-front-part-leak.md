title: Alleged iPad 5 front part with narrower bezels leaks
---
* Multiple reports have pointed to Apple’s fifth-generation iPad adopting design cues of its little brother, the iPad mini. Wednesday, another evidence surfaced suggesting that the iPad 5 indeed has the skinnier side bezels much akin to the iPad mini. Additionally, the gizmo is said to also borrow the iPad mini’s thin appearance, be lighter and resemble its aluminum design. Here’s a pair of photographs said to depict the device’s front panel which has reportedly leaked somewhere out of China…
* Looks like the screen size will remain the same 9.7 inches as on full-size models though the form factor may have shrunk as a result of the noticeably narrower bezels on the left and right side.
* The alleged part was republished by the French blog NowhereElse.fr, which previously leaked legitimate iPhone 5 and iPad mini parts ahead of the device’s respective launches.

* We still have no clue when Apple might release the iPad 5.
* According to yesterday’s DigiTimes report, Apple’s manufacturing partners are ramping up production of the device for the rumored July-August release. However, the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks the iPad 5 is due this Fall.
* Note that Apple refined the iOS multitouch technology in order to dismiss accidental touches when holding it in one’s hand due to the narrower side bezels.
* What do you think?
* Does this part look legit to you?
