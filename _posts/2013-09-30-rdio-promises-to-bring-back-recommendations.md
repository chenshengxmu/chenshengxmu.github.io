* As of recently, Rdio has been making a number of moves in a bid to fight off the Apple iTunes Radio threat. Just a few days ahead of Apple’s September 10 iTunes Radio launch, Rdio unveiled a new ad-supported music service in partnership with radio operator Cumulus.
* And back in August, the popular service gained such abilities as station tuning, improved search, Pandora-style personalized Stations and more.
* Rdio’s latest effort to re-introduce some of the original magic involves bringing back Recommendations, a feature popularized by the inaugural 1.0 version of Rdio…
* According to Rdio, Recommendations is rolling out to the web starting today and will be available on iOS “soon”. Just like the recently-launched Stations, Recommendations is meant to expose Rdio users to new music.
* Recommendations analyzes what you listen to most and who you’re following in order to suggest albums, stations and playlists you might like – yes, albums and stations as well!
* What’s best, it’s driven by the recommendation engine Echonest, which powers the likes of Spotify and BBC drawing from its database of 35 million songs.
* Key Recommendations highlights include:
* Album Recommendations — As you listen to music on Rdio, we compile albums you’re likely to enjoy based on your history. Every time you visit Recommendations, more new music is waiting. Station & Playlist Recommendations — Discover what stations and playlists are popular in your network and in your area.
* While features like Your FM and Stations ease music discovery, Recommendations is a compelling and powerful feature that shouldn’t have been removed from Rdio in the first place, if you ask me.
* Download Rdio free from the App Store.
* The 36.5MB universal application supports any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad device running iOS 5 or later and is optimized for the iPhone 5’s taller screen.
* The app has recently received a makeover proving Rdio very much cares about design. They claim a catalogue of over 20 million songs licensed for streaming.
