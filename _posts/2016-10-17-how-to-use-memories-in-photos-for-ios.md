* Apple’s Photos app for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV includes a powerful yet underrated feature, called Memories, which scans your media library to unearth your cherished or forgotten events, trips and people such as a weekend hike, your baby’s first birthday, a year’s best photos and videos, etc.
* Memories collates these items in gorgeous collections and even creates animated slideshows from them. In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with Memories, create your own animated slideshows, customize them to your liking with photos, videos, music, titles and much more.
* Memories are collections of photos and videos that can focus on:
* Memories are created automatically, or you can create them yourself.
* As mentioned, Memories is all about the photos and videos you haven’t seen or thought about for a while.
* But far from simply helping you re-discover your long forgotten photos from deep in your image library, Memories turns browsing your best photos and videos into an enjoyable experience thanks to attractive album layouts and animated slideshows.
* Rather than make copies of your existing photos and videos, Memories simply brings them together in special albums that you can view, share and edit.
* The Memories feature is available on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV.
* To enjoy Memories on iOS, you must update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to iOS 10 or later.  It requires the same hardware as iOS 10: the sixth-generation iPod touch or any iPhone or iPad model from the iPhone 4s or iPad mini 2/iPad 4 onward, respectively.
* Memories for Mac is available with macOS Sierra or later. You can check Mac hardware requirements for macOS Sierra here.

* Memories for Apple TV requires the fourth-generation Apple TV with tvOS 10 and iCloud Photo Library set up on the device. You can view Memories on your Apple TV, but not create, edit or share them.
* Each Memory may contain a Memory Movie set to music. These automatically created slideshows come complete with titles, cinematic transitions and gorgeous templates that you can choose from on the fly.
* Memories created from albums that don’t have enough photos and videos won’t generate a Memory movie. Photos also allows you to create your own Memory Movies from media in your albums.
* Memory Movies play on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. Photos for Mac currently does not support Memory Movies.
* In order for Photos to create Memories, it must first scan and analyze media in the Photos library, which can take some time after upgrading to iOS 10 depending on the number of items in your media library.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scanning-Photos-app.png)
* iOS only scans your library when the device is locked and connected to power. The magic behind Memories is advanced computer vision that helps Photos recognize seven basic facial expressions as well as a total of 4,432 different objects and scenes.
* Facial, object and scene recognition happens directly on the device, taking advantage of the power of Apple-designed silicon, without sending any user data to the cloud or syncing recognized scenes and objects via iCloud.
* In other words, Photos must analyze your library separately on each device even if all the devices you own have the same photos and videos on them.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wwdc-2016-photos-face-recognition.jpg)
* With the library analyzed, Photos will group the people, places and things inside your photos into special Memories albums.
* If you want to get the same Memories everywhere, you must set up and sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all your devices and enable iCloud Photo Library on every device you wish to use for Memories. This will ensure that up-to-date copy of your Photos library is available across all your devices for Memories to work with.
* Apple says that using on-device intelligence helps Memories create curated collections of your most meaningful photos and videos and bring them to life “in a way that’s personal and meaningful to you, while maintaining your privacy”.
* iOS leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide smart features like Memories and improved autocorrect suggestions as part of a new technique used throughout iOS 10, called Differential Privacy.
* You can see your old photos and videos in surprising new ways in the form of Memories in the stock Photos app. Your recent Memories can also be launched with 3D Touch from the Home screen or via a Today widget on the Lock screen.
* 1) Launch Photos on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap Memories in the tab area alongside the bottom.
* 2) You will be presented with a summary of the Memory’s contents. Just tap any desired Memory in the list to see its contents.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-viewing-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)
* Each Memory has a thumbnail image, creation date and title based on location the photos were taken, what’s on them (portraits, landscapes etc.) and other parameters.
* 3) You will now see the contents of the selected Memory, which can include both photos and videos. By default, Photos only displays the very best photos in any given Memory.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-viewing-iPhone-screenshot-002.jpg)

![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-holdiay-events-setting-iPhone-screenshot-001.png)
* If you want to enable or disable this feature, go to Settings → Photos & Camera and toggle the switch Show Holiday Events underneath the Memories heading.
* While Photos automatically creates Memories for you, sometimes you want to be in charge of curating photos and the stories behind them. To make a Memory from any Moment, Collection, Year or Album in your photo library, do the following:
* 1) Launch Photos and navigate to a Moment, Collection, Year or Album in your library.
* 2) Now tap on the header of any Moment, Collection, Year or Album to get to its automatically created Memory.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-create-iPhone-screenshot-002.jpg)
* 3) Scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap Add to Memories to add this Memory to your collection.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-create-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)
* I suggest confirming under the Memories tab that the newly created Memory has indeed been saved and added to your Photos collection.
* Memories that Photos creates can be organized in different ways. You can delete a Memory to stop it from appearing in Photos, save it for later, add related Memories to your collection and more.
* 1) Open Photos and tap the Memories tab at the bottom, then select a Memory you wish to delete.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-delete-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)
* 2) Scroll to the bottom, tap Delete Memory, then tap Delete Memory in the popup menu to confirm the action.
* 3D TOUCH SHORTCUT: On devices with 3D Touch, press a Memory to preview it and swipe up to reveal hidden options.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-delete-3D-Touch-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)
* Now select Delete Memory in the menu, then confirm the action by tapping Delete Memory in the popup menu.
* Photos provides a list of related Memories for you to explore.
* Found at the bottom of any Memory screen, related Memories are relevant to the one you’re currently viewing and are organized by people, places, scenes or events such as the beaches, mountains, birthdays, Thanksgiving Day, New Year and more.
* 1) Open Photos, tap the Memories tab at the bottom, then select a desire Memory.
* 2) Scroll down to see all related Memories and tap one to add it to your collection.
* 3) On the related Memory screen, scroll to the bottom and tap the option to add this related Memory to your collection.
![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-add-related-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)

![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-10-Memories-view-related-3D-Touch-iPhone-screenshot-001.jpg)
* Unfortunately, the preview screen does not contain any hidden options that would let you instantly save the Memory to your collection.
* Because Photos creates Memories automatically for you, a Memory you see today may not be available the next week, month or year as your media library grows. Thankfully, Photos lets you save any Memory for later.
* 1) Launch Photos on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap Memories in the tab area alongside the bottom.
* 2) Tap a Memory you’d like to save for later, scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap Add to Favorite Memories.

* If you decide that you don’t want to save a Memory anymore, you can remove it from your Favorite Memories by tapping the Remove from Favorite Memories at the bottom of the screen or in the shortcuts menu on devices with 3D Touch.

* All of your favorited Memories are stored in a special album, titled Favorite Memories.
* Photos automatically makes a movie for each Memory on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. You can play these animated slideshows on your iOS devices and the Apple TV. As mentioned before, Photos for macOS does not currently support Memory Movies.

* You can use Memories in landscape mode. The duration of the currently selected movie style is only displayed in portrait mode.
* You have the following moods at your disposal:
* As evidenced on the screenshot below, these built-in templates are quite nice and come complete with a distinct title from the larger selection of titles along with custom music and cinematic transitions. These styles are applied to the Memory Movie on the fly, as soon as you select them.

* As mentioned, I can tap any items with a checkmark on them to remove them from the movie so I’m going to do just that for the images I don’t like before adding the one with a smile and the Apple Watch one to my movie.
