* With the hundreds of leather wallet cases on the market, the biggest decision you have to make is how many credit card slots you want. If you want your wallet case to stand out in a crowd, try covering it in Twelve South’s BookBook case.
* Today, we are spotlighting the BookBook case to provide our readers with options for the type of case they may want to invest in to protect their iPhone 6s. We have not recently reviewed the case (we did a couple times in the past for other devices) and are unable to attest to its quality, but chose to spotlight it because of its high rating on Amazon.
* The hand-distressed leather case looks like a vintage book, not unlike the kind you’d find in your granddad’s office. Plus, it has four credit card slots and a clear window for you ID, while protecting your device.
* With the bookish design, the English major in your life will appreciate its aesthetic. But, it’s got all the right compartments for making your iPhone into the only wallet you’ll need to carry.
* Your iPhone 6s snaps into a soft shell case that can be easily removed if you need to use your device without the leather cover.
* When the front cover is flipped over, it doubles as a kickstand so you can prop up your iPhone 6s for watching movies or making FaceTime calls.
* The BookBook is available in brown or black for $60 on Amazon. There is also a version for the iPhone 6 Plus, which has an additional card slot thanks to its size.
