* Games are the most popular downloads in the App Store. On any given day, games make up about 80 percent of the top 10 lists for free and paid apps. Because there are so many amazing and cool titles launched in the App Store every day, this best-of list was hard to narrow down.
* After much consideration and deliberation, the writers at iDownloadBlog have come up with a list of what they think are the 10 best games of 2013. Check out our favorites and then vote for the one you like best to be added to our Best Apps of 2013 list…
* Only a month ago, FDG Entertainment launched an adventure game that sent Zelda fans scurrying. This fun sword swinging 3-D platformer lets players smash planters and chop weeds, just like the “Legend of Zelda” classic. The story is different and the characters don’t compare, but if you can’t help Link save the day on iOS, the next best thing is Oceanhorn. This game is available for $8.99.

* chAIR Entertainment’s third installment in the Infinity Blade series made a huge splash in the App Store with multiple characters to choose from, a dynamically changing environment based on your choices, global Clashmob challenges with group-based quests, and much more. Plus, the app has since been updated twice to include new quests, additional weapons, and new modes. This game is on sale for $2.99.

* Not everyone is big on epic controller-based games on the iPhone or iPad. Sometimes, a simple text-based game or casual puzzle game is the best option. QuizUp is the largest real-time trivia game. With more than four million players, you can go head to head against others to prove your smarts with 150,000 questions covering 280 topics. Categories include television, books, sports, and music. This game is available for free.

* Rockstar Games has been able to successfully port a number of GTA titles to iOS. San Andreas launched in 2004 with much fanfare. It featured new game mechanics, like gang wars and car tuning. Just a few weeks ago, it found its way into the App Store and comes with three different control schemes, game controller support, and customizable playlists. This game is available for $6.99.

* Just before Independence Day, a strange and beautiful atmospheric platform puzzle game found its way into the App Store. Gamers have enjoyed the story of the boy who goes in search of his missing sister in Limbo. Finally, iOS gamers were able to take the adventure on the road. The dark and deadly world is not a safe place for a young boy. Players must figure out how to get from one place to another by performing a series of tasks or putting together a number of items to create a solution. If you die one hundred times before finding the girl, you won’t be alone. This game is available for 4.99.

* Casual gamers will love the zen-like mechanics of this casual puzzle game. Players try to revert mixed up blocks to their original pattern. Each block has a certain number of moves that must be performed and all blocks must end up in their correct place. Thanks to the relaxing soundtrack that accompanies the game, players can wind down while stimulating their brain. This game is available for $0.99.

* Apple’s 2012 Game of the Year got a sequel for the iPad at the end of this year and it is just as fun, challenging, and good looking as its predecessor. In this title, players move from room to room, unlocking more boxes and trying to solve more mysteries. Each room has a different theme, as players are traveling through time. Each level has increasingly difficult puzzles. The only thing wrong with it is that it is over too soon. This game is available for $4.99.

* With the amount of time that MineCraft spent on the top 10 list in the App Store this year, you’d think no one was playing any other games. For a short period of time, game companies were launching titles with similar look and feel. Terraria is one of those games that pays homage to the popular world building game without copying it. Players go adventuring in order to dig for materials that they use to build a really cool pad that other characters will set up residence in. The game even includes multiplayer co-op mode for a collaborative adventure with friends. This game is available for $4.99.

* The story of this game comes from the Swedish experience of going on a yearlong walk to find oneself or discover the answer to a mystery. Players find themselves deep in a vast and unpopulated snow-covered forest, searching for answers and finding more mysteries. For a deeper and more interactive experience, download the free companion app, which is full of Swedish folklore, and might offer some hints as to what to do next. This game is available for $3.99.
