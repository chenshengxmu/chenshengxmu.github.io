* After announcing last week that its new title, Temple Run 2, saw 20 million downloads in its first 4 days, Imangi Studios is back today with news of another record-breaking milestone.
* Today, they announced that the sequel to the popular endless-runner game has been downloaded more than 50 million times on iOS, Android and Kindle devices in less than 2 weeks…
* That surpasses the record previously held by Rovio and Angry Birds Space for the fastest growing mobile game, set back in April of last year when it hit 50 million downloads in 35 days.
* “Imangi Studios today announced that Temple Run 2 has been downloaded over 50 million times on iOS, Android and Kindle devices. Reaching the milestone in 13 days breaks the previously set record for the fastest growing mobile game*. Temple Run 2 originally launched exclusively on the App Store on January 17 and quickly rose to the #1 slot in Free Apps, earning over six million downloads in less than 24 hours.”
* Co-founder of Imangi Keith Shepherd admits that “Temple Run has evolved into something much bigger” than their tiny studio, which consists of just Keith, his wife and a full-time artist.
* And he’s right about that. Temple Run is quickly going the way of Angry Birds, expanding into apparel, digital comics, and card and board games, among other licensing partnerships.
* If you haven’t tried Temple Run 2 yet, you can download here. There has to be a reason why it’s creating such a buzz, so it’s at least worth checking out. It’s currently #2 in the Top Free apps list.
