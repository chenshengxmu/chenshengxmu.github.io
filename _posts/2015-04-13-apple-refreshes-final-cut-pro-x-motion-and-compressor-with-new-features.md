* Monday, Apple announced a major update to its pro-grade video editing and processing programs for the Mac — Final Cut Pro X, Motion and Compressor — with a bevy of new features for motion graphics and key enhancements available to accelerate video editing, packaging and delivery.
* “From Hollywood blockbuster directors to first time movie makers, Final Cut Pro X is changing the way we edit movies today,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing. “The updated Final Cut Pro X, Motion and Compressor make it even easier to edit, title and package everything from short videos to feature-length films.”
* Final Cut Pro 10.2 introduces new easy to use 3D titles, improved masking for color grading and effects, and native support for more camera formats, as well as GPU-accelerated RED RAW processing.
* You can view up to four video scopes simultaneously (useful when color grading) in Final Cut Pro 10.2 and take advantage of improved Shape masks on any effect that can be saved as presets for quick access later.
* The refreshed software now boasts native support for Panasonic AVC-Ultra and Sony XAVC-S camera formats and faster processing of RED RAW files with GPU-accelerated transcoding, playback and rendering on dual GPUs of the Mac Pro and other systems.
* In addition to twelve new generator effects, improved key framing and enhanced controls for mask and shape creation, Motion 5.2 introduces additional options for 3D titles, with the ability to create dynamic titles with multiple lights and cameras, as well as multilayered scenes with 3D titles that cast ultra-realistic shadows and reflections on other objects.

* Furthermore, Motion 5.2 extends the power of 3D titles with the ability to create custom materials and environments and instantly publish them to Final Cut Pro X while Compressor 4.2 makes it ridiculously easy to package a movie for sale on the iTunes Store.
* The company said that “hundreds” of new 3D templates are coming soon for Motion from developers including Ripple Training, motionVFX and FxFactory. These templates will work seamlessly not only with Motion 5.2, but with the new versions of Motion and Final Cut Pro as well.
* Compressor 4.2 is now faster than ever by taking full advantage of your Mac’s hardware for encoding tasks, including GPU rendering when using Send to Compressor and hardware-accelerated multi-pass H.264 encoding on compatible systems.
* More importantly, Compressor 4.2 simplifies the process of packing your movie for sale on the iTunes Store. Now you only need to choose the movie, trailer, closed captions and other details and the app will create an iTunes Store Package. Video editors can then submit the package to an iTunes Delivery Partner for sale on the store.
* Final Cut Pro 10.2, Motion 5.2 and Compressor 4.2 will be available later today from the Mac App Store as free updates for existing customers.
* Final Cut Pro X is $299.99 in the Mac App Store.
* Motion and Compressor are available for $49.99 each.
