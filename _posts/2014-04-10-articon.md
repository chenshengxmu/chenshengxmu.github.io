* Articon is a jailbreak tweak that can spice up your Home screen by adding album artwork on top of the now-playing music app. The album artwork used by Articon is the same artwork that appears in the app that you use to play music.
* You might think that Articon’s effects would be limited to the stock Music app, but that isn’t the case. I was able to successfully have album artwork on my Spotify app, and even Amazon Instant Video—yep, it works with video playing apps as well.
* If you’re looking for a way to change up the look of your music or video app icons, then Articon is a tweak that might interest you. Have a glance at our video walkthrough inside for more information.
* Articon features a handful of options in its preferences found in the stock Settings app. You’ll find the standard kill-switch at the top of the preferences, and you’ll also find a panel for selecting the label text that appears beneath the app icons influenced by Articon.
* Users can choose to display the default app labels, album name, song name, or artist name beneath the app icons. There is a downside to selecting something other than default app labels. Long titles are truncated and don’t scroll when they surpass a certain character limit.

* I also wasn’t a big fan of how the album art suddenly disappears whenever opening an app infused with album artwork. It jumps back to the stock app icon in a jarring fashion, but I suppose iOS’ animations are more to blame for this flaw than anything else.

* Despite the issues with the animations and long labels, I believe that Articon is a worthwhile tweak. It’s a nice way to spice up your Home screen, and it provides real tangible benefits to the music listener and video watcher.
* You can find Articon for $0.99 on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. What do you think about it? Share your opinions down below in the comments.
