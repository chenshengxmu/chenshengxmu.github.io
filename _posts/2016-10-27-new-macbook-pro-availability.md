* Apple just announced pricing and availability information for its shiny new MacBook Pro. Apparently it will come in 3 models, starting at $1,499, and you can order them all today. Shipping times are different, however, depending on which model you’re after.
* The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro is essentially a MacBook Air replacement. It shares the slimmer design and various internals with the new MacBook Pro, but it comes with physical Function keys instead of the Touch Bar, and doesn’t have Touch ID.

* As aforementioned, this entry-level 13-inch model starts at $1,499, and you can see in the slide above, it starts shipping today. The next level up, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID, starts at $1,799, and it wills tart shipping in two-to-three weeks.
