* How fitting for the last day of 2017 to be a Sunday… and you know what that means: iDB Wallpapers of the Week. Given the coincidence, it seemed only fitting that this week’s post is a highlight of the year’s best Wallpapers of the Week. We went back through the site’s analytics to bring you the top 10 wallpaper posts of the year, well, and some from the previous year too!
* Shockingly some of these posts were actually from previous years, but we compiled this list based on web traffic. They are posted below in no particular order. And, they are not all iPhone X wallpapers!
* A big “thank you!”
* It is really you, the iDB community, that makes the Wallpapers of the Week section a possibility. Every week, I receive messages, tweets, retweets, emails, and other communications about wallpapers. Whether that is people looking for wallpapers or sharing wallpapers, thank you! I thoroughly enjoy writing this post each week to keep us with fresh wallpapers, every Sunday… but, only because you are such an engaged group of readers. I hope you were able to survive the mess that was 2017 and I wish you all the best in 2018. It is a time of year for reflection and as it relates to iDB, my reflection is one of thanks for such a great readership.
* Given that the weekly posts include at least 5 images and there are a few mid-week wallpapers for special occasions, there were more than 275 new images uploaded to the section over 2017.
* I’d like to give a special shout out to Agostino, @AR72014, (iDB gallery) who is a regular feature on the site, especially in the last year. His creative work has been really impressive. He is featured several times in the articles below and is the sole artist for the highly popular post, original Apple wallpaper collection optimized for iPhone X, linked below.
* Y’all are the best! Happy New Year! Here’s to another 52 sets of wallpapers in the new year.
* Make a 2018 resolution
* Contribue to the Wallpapers of the week collection by connecting with me via @jim_gresham. I curate the post on a weekly basis. Send your tips, tricks, or images my way. Follow along for mid-week downloads and previews of next week’s post.
