* Ladies and gentlemen, we’re entering the final stretch of waiting before the WWDC keynote. With just one weekend to go until Tim Cook and others hit the stage on Monday in San Francisco, we’ve heard rumors about pretty much everything that is planned to be unveiled. In particular, Apple is expected to take the wraps off its iOS 8 software update as one of the headline announcements at the keynote…

* Just in case you remain skeptical that iOS 8 is in fact right around the corner, Business Insider reporter Jay Yarow just recently tweeted out a picture of an iOS 8 banner being setup at the Moscone Center. While we won’t go as far as saying iOS 8 is guaranteed to be in the cards, the banner does all but confirm the software update will be at the center of the weeklong conference.
* WWDC begins next Monday with a live keynote at 10:00 AM Pacific. We will be providing the latest news and updates that come out of the keynote as it unfolds, while Apple will be live streaming the event. WWDC has served as a platform for several key product and service releases in the past, ranging from next-generation iPhones and Macs to new iOS and OS X versions.
* Are you excited?
