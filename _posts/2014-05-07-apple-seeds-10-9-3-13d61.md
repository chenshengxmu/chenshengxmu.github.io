* Apple has seeded another beta for OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The update comes just one week after the eighth beta was released, which brought about few notable changes.
* The new build is available to developers via an update in the Mac App Store or as a download on Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s new Beta Seed program yet…
* We’ve seen a number of enhancements in 10.9.3 thus far, including the addition of a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays and the restoration of the ability to sync local contacts and calendar info.
* Today’s build is labeled 13D61, and comes just hours after Apple reportedly distributed a new OS X 10.9.3 build (13D62) to AppleCare employees. It’s believed that 10.9.3 could launch as soon as this week.
