* Yesterday we told you that Gameloft and Twitch were teaming up to bring live gameplay streaming to mobile devices. Their first project is Asphalt 8: Airborne, where users will be able to stream live video of them playing the game from their iPhone or iPad to their Twitch channel.
* As we noted before, the new feature will launch alongside an upcoming Asphalt 8 update that will add new cars, new maps and more. And Gameloft has just posted a great-looking trailer for the release, titled ‘Welcome to the Great Wall,’ which we’ve posted for you down below…
* And here’s the accompanying text:
* “The biggest update since launch is coming! Discover The Great Wall with your McLaren P1, Ferrari Testarossa or any of the other new dream cars, and share your journey with your friends using the brand new Twitch broadcasting feature!”
* Of course, the big news here is the Twitch integration. This will be the first time ever that players will be able to broadcast their mobile gameplay to the web for millions to watch, and they’ll also be able to stream their voice and image using their microphone and front-facing camera.
* For those not familiar with the title, Asphalt 8: Airborne is an award-winning mobile arcade racing game where players race against A.I. or real-world players, while performing dynamic, high-speed aerial stunts. It’s recorded nearly 48 million installs and an App Store rating of 4.5 stars.
* You grab the game for both the iPhone and iPad, here for free. And we’ll let you know as soon as the Great Wall update hits.
