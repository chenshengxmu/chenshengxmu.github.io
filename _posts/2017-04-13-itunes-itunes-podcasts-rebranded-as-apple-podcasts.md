* Apple’s long offered a dedicated podcast directory, titled iTunes Podcasts. As first noted by 9to5Mac, the company has rebranded iTunes Podcasts as Apple Podcasts and is now offering redesigned badge artwork and icons for publishers to use via its Apple Podcasts Identity Guideline webpage.
* Refreshed badge graphics is now showing the “Listen on Apple Podcasts” message.
* The company’s dedicated podcast client on App Store has retained its “Podcasts” name though Apple could release a small update soon with new branding.
* As additionally noted by MacRumors, Apple’s iTunes Podcasts account on Twitter has now turned into @ApplePodcasts so users can get up-to-date recommendations on the newest and best podcasts right from their Twitter feed.
* Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, indicated at the Code Media conference in February 2017 that his company might be working on new features for podcasters.
* Apple is “working on new features for podcasts, stay tuned,” he told Recode’s Peter Kafka while emphasizing that customers love the ability to “listen to something on demand whenever you want.”
* The company also met with top podcasters a year ago to hear their complaints.
* iTunes’ podcasting hub has remained virtually unchanged since its 2005 debut.
* It’s unclear if the company plans on adding a paid subscription feature to iTunes to let listeners directly support their favorite shows, as some have suggested. Any significant updates or new features for podcasters that Apple may have in the works should be saved for the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June.
