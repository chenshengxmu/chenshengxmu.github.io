* At CES this year, fitness accessory startup Fitbit announced the final missing piece of its highly-regarded activity-tracking line: a wristband. Dubbed the ‘Flex,’ it offers all of the durability and accuracy of its clip-on products, in a more wearable solution.
* Initial market feedback for the band was tremendous, but a lot of that enthusiasm has seemingly subsided during this lengthy waiting period between announcement and availability. Nevertheless, the Fitbit Flex is finally here and available for purchase…
* Here’s a quick recap of some of Flex’s features:
* Know your stats: Tracks steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutes Getting good ZZZs: Tracks quality of sleep (# of hours, how many times you wake up, sleep efficiency index) and uses a silent alarm that vibrates to wake you up gently First and only wristband to: Sync to select mobile devices via Bluetooth 4.0 (first all-day wristband tracker to offer this capability). It also syncs wirelessly and automatically to your computer. Multi-platform: Syncs to select iPhone and, now, select Android devices With you all the time: Comfortable enough to wear all day. Water-resistant. Wear it in the shower. Match your mood or personality: Flexible, interchangeable tracker with a variety of colorful wristbands (Black, Slate, Teal, Tangerine, Navy) Rich mobile and online offerings: iPhone and Android App and Online tools – shows activity charts, leaderboards and more. Set goals, view progress and earn badges. Social motivation: Connect with friends and family for support or friendly competition Even more health and fitness tools: Log food, weight and more on Fitbit’s website or apps
* Due to today’s launch, Fitbit has raised the embargo on tech journalists who have been using the Flex over the past month, allowing them to publish their reports. And after a quick scan through some of the reviews, it seems like most of them liked the product.
* The Verge gives the Flex an 8.0 out of 10, and says the accessory is both accurate and consistent, and has great battery life. Engadget also really liked it, saying it offers the most well-rounded package in its market, and gives you the “best bang for your buck.”
* If you’d like to purchase the Fitbit Flex, it’s available now on Fitbit’s website for $100, including free shipping. The wristband comes in either black or turquoise blue, but you can get a 3-pack of different-colored bands (red, teal, navy) from Fitbit for $30.
* What do you think, will you be picking up a Fitbit Flex?
