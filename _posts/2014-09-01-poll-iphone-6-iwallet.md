* A flurry of reports in recent days from the likes of Re/code, Wired, Financial Times, Bloomberg and The Information have pointed to Apple eyeing a pay-by-touch iPhone technology by partnering with some of the world’s biggest payment processors and credit card companies like AmEx, MasterCard and Visa.
* The mobile payment feature is thought to involve technologies such as NFC and Touch ID and tap into a pool of more than the 800 million iTunes accounts with credit cards on file.
* The question is, do you see yourself using the iPhone 6 as your wallet? Or, maybe you’re the type of person who prefers sticking to plastic and good ol’ cash?
* Here, cast your vote now.
* According to Wired, the so-called iWallet is going to be “one of the hallmark features” of the iPhone 6 when the device is unveiled on September 9, alongside a rumored wearable product.
* Speaking of which, an Apple-branded wearable accessory— assuming it does exist and tie into the mobile payment service — would make paying for goods at the checkout counter ridiculously simple: imagine, if you will, paying for groceries without even having to pull an iPhone out of your pocket!

* The mobile payment feature, if the rumor-mill is right, requires the upcoming iPhone 6.
* The handset will reportedly come outfitted with an NXP-made Near-Filed Communication (NFC) chip, use the Touch ID fingerprint scanning feature to approve payments and store confidential payment data inside a secure enclave on the NFC chip.
* I would love to hear arguments related to your vote so tell us why you’ve opted for an iWallet or cash down in the comments.
