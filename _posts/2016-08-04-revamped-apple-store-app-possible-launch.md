* Welcome to Thursday, when Apple typically refreshes its app and content stores with new apps, games and media. Bloomberg said last week that Apple was working on a totally overhauled Apple Store shopping app that should include a “For You” tab and have the same basic features and interface across the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* Reports on Twitter and MacRumors reveal that a banner for the new Apple Store app has now gone live on some international App Stores, suggesting imminent launch.
* The banner clearly promotes the new Apple Store shopping app with the tagline “Shopping designed around you.” As originally noted by MacRumors, earlier this morning Apple also added a new Easily Track Your Order section to its Shipping and Pickup page, showing off a partial order tracking screen from the new app.
