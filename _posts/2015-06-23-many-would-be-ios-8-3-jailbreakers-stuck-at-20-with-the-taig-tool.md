* Many would-be jailbreakers are stuck at the 20% progress mark with the just-released TaiG 2.0.0 jailbreak tool for iOS 8.3. The jailbreak starts well enough, but after a quick takeoff, putters out at the 20% mark. Thankfully a workaround is now available.
* After a few minutes of being stuck on 20%, the iPhone will reboot and will stay stuck at 20%, and the reboot process will continue. Are you experiencing this issue? Sound off in our comments

* After a few reboots, you’ll received a Jailbreak failed error message. The message states
* Please don’t worry. Click the button below for solutions (-1101). After clicking the Solutions button, you’re met with a page that features no solution for the -1101 error.

* Here are some of the things that I’ve tried:
* Some people are stating that by downgrading iTunes, you can successfully jailbreak. I’m running the latest version of iTunes, but am going to downgrade to iTunes 12.0.1 (32-bit) and give it a shot.
* As we gather more intel and reliable methods for fixing this issue, we’ll update this post. Please share any suggestions that you have in the comments as well.
* Update: I fixed this issue by downgrading iTunes. See my post here.
