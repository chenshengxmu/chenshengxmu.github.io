* Following up on last week’s release of its would-be Snapchat killer, Slingshot, and building on notable updates to Paper, Messenger and its main iOS client, the social networking behemoth Facebook today gave its neglected Pages Manager some love.
* Now live in the App Store, the new Facebook Pages Manager 4.0 has a streamlined new look and a brand new app icon which feels at home in iOS 7.0 while offering several improvements such as the addition of post editing, better Page’s activity and insights, replies with threaded comments and more…
* The redesigned UI certainly feels more, well, flatter.
