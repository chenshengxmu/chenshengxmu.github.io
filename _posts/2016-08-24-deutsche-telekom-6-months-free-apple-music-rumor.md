* German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom is reportedly planning to lure prospective customers into the fold by enticing them with six free months of Apple Music, about a $60 value.
* German-language blog iPhone-ticker.de reported Wednesday that Deutsche Telekom is set to announce the offer at IFA in Berlin, Europe’s largest consumer electronics show that runs September 2-7.
* The offer is said to be aimed primarily at those who haven’t yet tried Apple’s Spotify competitor. Instead of the usual three-month free trial that Apple Music has offered since its inception, Deutsche Telekom is said to give new customers a prolonged six-month free trial.
* After a customer’s six months of Apple Music have expired, their mobile phone bill—not their credit card on file with iTunes—would get charged €9.99 per month to continue using the music service, iPhone-ticker.de reports.
* The additional three months of service on top of Apple’s existing three-month trial would be paid for by Deutsche Telekom itself, claims the report. This is interesting because it’s doubtful that any carrier would launch such a promotion without consulting with Apple.
* And if Apple is OK with such an offer, who’s to say that similar promotions for Apple Music couldn’t be in tow for customers of U.S. wireless carriers?
