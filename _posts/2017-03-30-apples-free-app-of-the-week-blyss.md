* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Blyss. For the next 7 days you’ll be able to pick up the popular puzzler for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving you a solid buck.
* Blyss is essentially an endless puzzle adventure that features calming, serene graphics and a transcendent soundtrack. Features include unlimited, unique puzzles, 3 game modes, and a player leaderboard.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Some dots take one swipe, some take two. But one thing’s for certain: if you want to clear every puzzle, you have to think through your moves. Failure’s inevitable in the high-stakes Endless mode—but trust us—you won’t mind restarting.
* And here’s a video of the game in action:
* Blyss is available for free in the App Store.
