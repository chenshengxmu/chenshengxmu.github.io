* To make life easier for people looking to switch to an iPhone and iOS 9 over from an Android device, Apple will be providing a dedicated iPhone and iPad application called ‘Move to iOS’.
* Yet to be released in the App Store, Move to iOS was designed to simplify the process of transferring user data securely from an Android phone or tablet to a new iPhone or iPad.
* “Just download the Move to iOS app to wirelessly switch from your Android device to your new iOS device,” Apple says.
* Mentioned as a subsection of Apple’s iOS 9 Preview webpage, the forthcoming app will move over the following data from an Android phone to an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 9 or later.
* Move to iOS also takes care of rebuilding your Android app library on an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, with any free apps like Facebook and Twitter being suggested for download from the App Store.
* “And your paid apps are added to your iTunes Wish List,” Apple says cunningly.
* Though Apple did not provide details, looks like Move to iOS will launch in both the App Store and Google Play Store this fall, when iOS 9 will be released for public consumption.
* After the data has been moved to an iOS device, Apple will even recycle your old Android handset in a retail store.
