* Do you need a nice, leather iPad 2 case with a built-in keyboard for a reasonable price? The we have a case for you. The iPad 2 Case with Keyboard protects your iPad while at the same time offering you a kickstand and full keyboard for typing.
* At only $34, this case is one of the best deals you can find on a case/keyboard combo for the iPad. We’ve got more details below.
* “PI Manufacturing’s iPad 2 leather case and Bluetooth keyboard is a great way to protect your iPad 2 from dust and scratches while also making it easier for you to use with the convenience of a built-in Bluetooth keyboard. The case props up your iPad 2 like a laptop screen for easy viewing and typing. The Bluetooth keyboard is compatible with most devices that support Bluetooth, including smart phones, laptops, and more with a range of up to 32 feet. The Bluetooth keyboard battery lasts roughly a week without needing to be charged. To fully recharge the battery, the Bluetooth keyboard includes a micro-USB port for you to plug in a micro-USB cable. The Bluetooth keyboard is made of silicone for silent typing to not disturb others.”
* After testing the iPad 2 Case with Keyboard, I can confirm that it does its job. You get what you pay for, and PI Manufacturing’s case isn’t of the same quality as more expensive options. But for the cost, I haven’t seen a case and keyboard this good.

* The keyboard works well, and I didn’t have any trouble typing away while my iPad was propped up. I like the way that the iPad 2 Case with Keyboard protects the iPad, and the built-in stand works well. Battery life for the keyboard is pretty decent, and I found that it lasted over a week with pretty consistent use.
