* Customers have already rushed to get their pre-orders in for the new iPad, as it’s set to deliver and go on sale in-stores this Friday. Apple confirmed that the first wave of iPads are sold out and that demand for the new tablet is “off the charts”.
* Today, Apple has revealed it plans to open its new Houston retail store this Friday, at 8 AM. Apple typically opens its stores at 10 AM, but has made an exception this time around. More than likely, this reveals that Apple will begin selling the new iPad in its stores Friday at 8AM…
* Apple will have a limited amount of iPads available in-store and is expected to sell out. Some devoted Apple fans have already started camping outside of stores in order to get their hands on the Retina display madness.
* Last year, Apple also did similar by opening its doors a bit early. Going against usual device launch tradition, last year for the iPad 2, Apple didn’t allow customers to pre-order until the night before the launch of the new tablet. This year, Apple made pre-orders available the day the third-generation iPad was announced.
* Shipping times for the new iPad have now slipped to 2-3 weeks, but if you’re lucky, you might be able to grab one in-store on Friday.
* Will you be braving the long lines on Friday?
