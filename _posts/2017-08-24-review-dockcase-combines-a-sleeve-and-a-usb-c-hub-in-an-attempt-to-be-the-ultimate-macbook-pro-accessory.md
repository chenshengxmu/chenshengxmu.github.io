* DockCase is an unusual prospect. It takes two useful accessories and makes an attempt to combine them together into a single, indispensable MacBook Pro companion.
* DockCase is literally what it sounds like. The combination of a dock, and a case. Though it doesn’t have the most original name, the idea is quite clever. The case is leather with a soft microfiber interior. It is basically a sleeve, that opens on the short end instead of the long. The flap is held closed with a series of magnets, which is quite handy. Since the idea is to make this a single solution for your MacBook on the go, they even build a channel on the interior to house a USB-C cable to connect to the DockCase.

* You have many port options included on the side of the DockCase. Included are:

* I appreciate the ability to carry nothing but the DockCase, and have a case, hub, USB-C cable, all packed together, with effectively no bulk. Alternatively, I’d bring something like a Satechi USB-C hub. However, that is more costly, lacks several of the I/O options, and offers my machine no protection.
* One random thing I noticed in my testing was with the sleeve. I’d often put it up on its end, then slide the laptop in from the top. It’s a bit awkward in real life though because one end is crafted out of aluminum. I almost feel like I could damage something hitting it against my desk or something. Will it really damage it? Probably not. It’s crafted out of aluminum, and unlikely to be damaged just because I stood it up on its end. It just makes noise and causes me to be nervous.

* The biggest selling point for the DockCase is the fact you don’t have to tote around multiple accessories. The case is very well made, feels solid, and comes in 4 different colors. The dock offers all the necessary I/O that sometimes get overlooked. I also appreciate that they worked to provide ample space between the ports. They aren’t too close together like a few of the other hubs that I find to be quite frustrating.
* I don’t have many problems with the DockCase. It does what it does well. The biggest question is whether you need a dock like this in the first place. I can see a lot of people who don’t plug a lot in and are perfectly happy bringing nothing but a power adapter. Personally, I just wish I could fit it in my bag. The added length of the sleeve attributed to the dock makes it a bit tight of a squeeze for many horizontal messenger bags. I also felt the metal on the bottom was a bit awkward when putting the laptop in and out of the case (if you ever would set it on your desk).
* There has been an unrelenting parade of USB-C docks and hubs hitting the market since the release of the new MacBook Pros. The DockCase aims to differentiate itself with a clever design and added functionality. I actually really love the idea of it, and in practice, it’s actually very handy. I think it looks stylish too, so it isn’t like you are getting a subpar case with a stellar dock, or vice versa.
* Currently, DockCase has raised well above its goal over on KickStarter. They have models available for the 13″ Pro as well as the 15″, each in 4 different colors of microfiber leather. If you are interested, you can save about $50 off of full retail during the Kickstarter campaign, with delivery expected in November. The 13″ model runs $79 and the 15″ is $89. Considering competitor’s options, that seems like a very fair price.
* Shout out in the comments if you think this is either a great idea, or I’m crazy for liking it.
