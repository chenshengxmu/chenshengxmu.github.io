* Spotify, the popular music streaming service, has been available in some European countries since 2008, gathering new members every day. Now it looks like it’s time for them to take the plunge and start offering their services in the US, too. If you navigate to their website, you can sign up by entering your email, and you will be notified as soon as they open for business.
* With over 10 million registered users, 1 million of which are paying members, Spotify is one of the best services of its kind. What makes it so special is the fact that you can access it via a browser, or download the dedicated apps for iOS or Mac OS X. These apps have a gorgeous design and if you’re daring enough, they could even replace iTunes and the iPod app…
* The guys at Spotify claim that their library contains over 13 million songs, which are way more than any computer can store, giving you an immense library from which to choose from.
* Once the service is available, it certainly is going to be free for the basic stuff, but if you would like to take more out of Spotify, you can sign up either for the Unlimited or Premium packages. Looking at the European prices, we can guess that they are going to cost you $5 and $10 a month respectively. Refer to this page if you would like to know more about the features offered in the aforementioned packages.
* Do you already stream music? Would you be tempted to switch to Spotify once it’s available? I would be.
