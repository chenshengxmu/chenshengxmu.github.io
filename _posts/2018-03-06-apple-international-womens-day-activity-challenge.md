* As suspected a few days ago, Apple’s now debuted a new Activity challenge for Apple Watch wearers to honor International Women’s Day which is celebrated on March 8 every year.
* Double your Move ring on Thursday, March 8 (lowering the Move goal for the day won’t help) to earn a nice medal in the Activity app on your iPhone, plus a set of still and animated themed stickers in the Messages app which you can send and receive to friends via iMessage.
* As an example, if your daily Move goal is 300 calories, you’ll need to burn 600 calories on Thursday in order to win this new award.

* Apple Watch downloads new Activity challenges from a dedicated server, making it easy for people to scrape the data source in order to discover fresh details about any upcoming challenges a few days sooner than they’re scheduled to officially go live.
* This challenge should be international given the global scope of International Women’s Day, which commemorates the movement for women’s rights.
* Apple is also celebrating International Women’s with sub-$10 iTunes movies featuring strong female characters like “Wonder Woman”, “Mean Girls”, “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Room”, plus a “Celebrating Bold Women” playlist in Apple Music’s Browse tab.
