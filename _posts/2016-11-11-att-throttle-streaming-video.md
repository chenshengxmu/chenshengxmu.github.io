* AT&T on Friday announced a new feature for its data plans called Stream Saver. The carrier calls it a “free and convenient, data-saving feature” that will cap most mobile video streams at DVD quality (or around 480p).
* It sounds harmless at first, but customers who aren’t concerned with data may not like that the feature will be enabled by default. To watch hi-def video, you’ll have to opt out via the myAT&T app or the AT&T website.
* Stream Saver lets you watch more video on your wireless phone or tablet while using less data, by streaming most higher definition video at standard definition quality, similar to DVD (about 480p). Stream Saver helps your data go further.
* […] “We know our customers love to be entertained while mobile, and Stream Saver lets them enjoy more of what they love, whether it’s video or something else,” said David Christopher, chief marketing officer, AT&T Entertainment Group. “And, they are in control – it’s their choice on how to use this innovative feature.”
* AT&T says that it will start rolling out the feature in early 2017 to customers on its “most popular plans.” Once it’s available, they’ll receive a message letting them know it’s on along with directions on how to disable it.
