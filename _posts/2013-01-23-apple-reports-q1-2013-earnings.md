* Here it is folks. After all of the rumors of slipping iPhone and iPad demand, which sent the company’s stock tumbling, and the many ‘doomed’ headlines, Apple’s Q1 2013 quarterly earnings report is finally here. So how’d they do?
* Given the significance of these numbers, we’ll just get right down to it. During the holiday quarter, Apple sold 47.8 million iPhones, 22.9 million iPads and produced 54.5 billion in revenue. We’ll have more figures after the break…
* Here’s a breakdown of all of Apple’s notable sales figures from last quarter:
* And here’s Apple’s press release:
* “The Company sold 47.8 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 128 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 15.43 million iPads during the quarter, a 111 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, a 26 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 15.4 million iPods, a 21 percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter.
* “We’re thrilled with our outstanding results and record-breaking sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple’s momentum is incredibly strong, and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline.”
* “We are very happy to have generated over $17.5 billion in cash flow from operations during the December quarter,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter of 2012, which will span 13 weeks, we expect revenue of about $32.5 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share of about $8.50.”
* Despite the fact that Apple set company records for both revenue and iPhone sales during the quarter, the company missed Wall Street projections in both metrics. Analysts were expecting 50+ million iPhones and $55B in revenue.
* Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter how many times you say ‘record’ when you miss Street projections. Since Apple published the earnings report, its stock is down some 5% in after-hours trading. At the moment, it’s at $488 per share.
* Apple’s earnings call begins in about 15 minutes, and if you’d like, you can listen to it. Otherwise, be sure to keep checking back with us this afternoon as we bring you announcements and commentary from the call.
