* Google’s kid-focused YouTube app received a major update today with a brand new look and feel. Amongst its other enhancements are profiles for each child, plus new parental controls.
* The first major feature is the new, adaptive design.
* It actually changes the appearance of the app based on the child’s age. That way, YouTube Kids is appropriate for children of all ages as they won’t feel the app is out of their age range.
* The new profiles also play into this.
* Each kid is able to have their own preferences and profile so when they use the app, it adapts to them and their age. For instance, children of younger ages will see bigger images and more icons. As they get older, they will see more text and additional content in their home feed.
* Kids can even passcode-protect their profiles to keep their siblings out.

* Of course, this can be overridden by a parent if need be.
* All in all, Google’s nicely done YouTube Kids app is a great way for your children to watch YouTube and be limited to age-specific content.
* Kid profiles are available in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, India, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, USA and Zimbabwe.
* You can download YouTube Kids from App Store for free.
