* References to unreleased Apple-branded mouse, keyboard and trackpad accessories have been discovered in OS X code by French blog Consomac. Code strings discovered in the latest OS X 10.11.1 beta 3 point to the Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2, which are likely next-generation versions of Apple-branded mouse and trackpad. In addition, the strings hint at a brand new keyboard, dubbed the Magic Keyboard.
* Apple’s current aluminum keyboard comes in wireless ($69) and wired ($49) flavors. The present-generation Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad are priced at $69 each.
* Two months ago, a filing with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) described a “Magic Mouse 2” accessory and an updated wireless keyboard.

* Unlike the existing trackpad, mouse and keyboard that use Bluetooth 2.1 wireless networking and AA batteries, the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 should use Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy connectivity and rechargeable lithium-on batteries.
* As a result, folks will no longer need to swap AA batteries every few weeks or so. The New York Times also corroborated the upcoming accessories, saying the new keyboard will feature backlit keys like Mac notebooks.
* Citing a person briefed on the products, the newspaper added that a revamped iPad keyboard may also be available by the end of this year.
* Maybe Apple’s refreshed mouse, keyboard and trackpad will come outfitted with Touch ID and Force Touch. What do you think?
