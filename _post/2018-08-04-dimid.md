* Your iOS device comes with display dimming settings out of the box, but they aren’t very robust. Those looking for additional flexibility in this department might take an interest in a new jailbreak tweak release called Dimid by iOS developer LonestarX.
* With Dimid, you’re no longer limited to the chintzy display dimming options Apple provides in iOS. Instead, the tweak augments the experience with a slew of new customization options.
* When you install Dimid, you’ll find a new preference pane in the Settings app:

* Will Dimid be the next tweak you try on your jailbroken device? Let us know in the comments section below.
