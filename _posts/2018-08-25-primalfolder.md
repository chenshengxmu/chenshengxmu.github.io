* Keeping your iPhone’s Home screen organized is a cinch with folders. But if you’re looking for a bit more folder customization than Apple provides out of the box, then you might take an interest in a new free jailbreak tweak called PrimalFolder by iOS developer ichitaso.
* Citing the tweak’s Cydia description, PrimalFolder was inspired mainly by TapTapFolder, a previous jailbreak tweak by iOS developer QusicS. That said, you can expect to see much of the same functionality with this launch.
* Right out of the box, PrimalFolder reconfigures your Home screen’s folders to show the icon of the first app rather than nine smaller icons in a grid. Additionally, the tweak lets you quickly launch the first app in a folder with a 3D Touch gesture or a double-tap.
* But that’s not all PrimalFolder can do for you. You’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app where you can customize the tweak’s behavior:

* Here, you can:
* PrimalFolder won’t be for everyone, especially the tidbit that changes the folder icon to match the first app in the folder. But the shortcut gestures are somewhat useful, and it’s a shame that Apple doesn’t offer something like this on a stock installation of iOS.
* If you’re interested in trying PrimalFolder out for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices.
