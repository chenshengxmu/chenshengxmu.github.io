* It was yesterday that the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo called for a new iPhone model sporting a whopping 128 gigabytes of built-in storage – twice as much as today’s high-end 64GB iPhone 5 – and already a brand new SKU (Stock-Keeping Unit) reference has been spotted in a German retailer’s sales system.
* Though we can’t vouch for the genuinity of the included screenshot, it looks legit seemingly depicting the retail system of Media Markt, a German chain of stores selling consumer electronics with numerous branches throughout Europe and Asia…
* Though no specific SKU code is revealed, at first glance the listing appears to reference a rumored 128GB iPhone 5 rather than a 128GB iPhone 5S variant Kuo mentioned yesterday.
* According to the German blog Macerkopf.de which posted the screenshot, the entry does not reference any specific device number so those X signs before the iPhone 5 mention might as well point to a 128GB iPhone 5S model.
* Me?
* I’m with Kuo: the 128GB variant is likely going to be an iPhone 5S exclusive. The 128GB iPhone in gold color should appeal to power users and rich people who like showing off, like Kim Kardashian.
* The gold iPhone 5 color conversion via AnoStyle.

* Apple notably pulled a similar move by quietly adding a 128GB iPad 4 variant to the lineup back in March.
* If the rumors are true, Apple will announce the iPhone 5S upgrade and possibly a rumored plastic iPhone at the upcoming September 10 media event.
