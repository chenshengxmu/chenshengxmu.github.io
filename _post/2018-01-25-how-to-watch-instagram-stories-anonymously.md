* Every time you watch one of your friends’ Instagram stories, whether it is a photo or video, the person can actually tell you saw it. But what if you wanted to see their Instagram stories without them knowing? There is actually a way to do just that right from your iPhone.
* In this post, we will show you how to view an Instagram story without someone knowing you did, giving you a glimpse at your friends’ life while still keeping a sense of anonymity. To do that, we will be using a free app called Story Reposter.

* Because you didn’t have to login to Instagram in the first place, you can see anyone’s stories without the person finding out or having any sort of indication you did.
* You can repeat the process for as many people as you want. The only catch is that the person’s Instagram profile cannot be private. If it is set to private, you will not be able to find and watch their stories.
