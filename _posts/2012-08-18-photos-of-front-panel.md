* The amount of claimed leaked next-generation iPhone parts we’re seeing is starting to get out of control. Yesterday we saw a purported dock connector for the handset, and now this.
* The above photo is of what’s believed to be a complete front panel belonging to Apple’s next smartphone. It has the rumored elongated display, and a repositioned FaceTime camera…
* MacRumors has the pics, which were uploaded by nationwide repair shop UBreakiFix. The firm says that it received the photos from one of their distributers and they appear legitimate.
* The display in the next iPhone is said to measure 4-inches in diagonal, up from 3.5-inches, with a resolution of 1136 x 640. This theory has been corroborated by a number of news outlets, as well as a recent discovery that Apple’s upcoming software scales to fit such a display.
* At this point, it’s hard to imagine that the designs seen in previous part leaks are anything but accurate. They’re Apple-like, they’re consistent, and there’s obviously a lot of them floating around.
* Of course, Apple could still pull a 180 and surprise everyone at its iPhone event next month. But we’re not counting on it.
