* Wouldn’t that be great if you could be notified of jailbreak tweaks updates without having to launch Cydia and waiting forever for it to refresh sources and reload data? Your dream might soon come to reality with CydiaBulletin, an upcoming tweak by Ryan Petrich that we already previewed last month.
* Petrich teases us once again today with a screenshot of CydiaBulletin for iPad…
* There is currently no word about when this tweak will be available for download, but at this point, we can only assume it will be sooner than later.
* What do you think about CydiaBulletin? Doesn’t it look like a must-have tweak?
