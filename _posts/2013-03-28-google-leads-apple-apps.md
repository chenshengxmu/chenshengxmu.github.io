* Obviously, home field advantage doesn’t hold sway when it comes to app stores. That’s the message from a new report showing Google the leading publisher on Apple’s App Store while Facebook downloads outnumbered Google on the Mountain View, California company’s own marketplace.
* Although Apple led apps downloaded from its App Store in December, iOS video and mapping apps from Android’s Google topped its smartphone rival during January and February. Meanwhile, a Facebook app grabbed the top spot on Google Play, reinforcing the importance of social networking downloads in generating app store revenue…
* According to researchers at App Annie (via The Next Web) YouTube and Google Maps snatched the top two spots for most downloads.
* That’s quite a feat, given Apple junked the Internet giant’s mapping service for its own. Google Maps eventually returned as an iOS app after Apple Maps literally and virtually fell off a cliff.
* In a similar turn of events, Google found itself outmaneuvered by social networking giant Facebook on its own home turf.
* Despite publishing 62 apps for Android devices at its Google Play site, the company ranked only second in terms of download popularity, according to the app analytics firm.

* Instead, Facebook apps took three of the top five apps downloaded: the social network’s main app, the company’s Messenger app and the recently-acquired Instagram app.
* The dominance of Facebook app only supports an earlier App Annie report which indicated social networking apps are becoming the key downloads, other than games.
* Signaling how gaming apps can overwhelm the entire mobile app sector, App Annie also announced it has begun separating its research of game apps from other app categories.
