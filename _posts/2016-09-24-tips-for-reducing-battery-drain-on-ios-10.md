* Apple’s newest firmware update for iPhone and iPad brings a slew of new features to them, but according to several users, iOS 10 also happens to be quite thirsty for battery power.
* If you feel you’re not getting the battery life you should expect after upgrading your device(s), you may want to follow these tips to help increase the amount of time you can spend using them on a single charge.

* Some of the most battery intensive processes on your iOS devices are those that ping your location. By limiting these features, some of which are extraneous for many users, you can reduce the amount of times your device has to track you via GPS and save a lot of battery life.
* You can tinker with your location settings in Settings → Privacy → Location Services.

* Right next to location services, your display is one of the biggest drains on your battery. The higher you keep your display brightness, the more battery you’re going to drain.
* iOS can control this automatically, but in sunny environments this tends to lead to more battery drain because iOS is always trying to compensate for visibility by increasing the brightness. By manually controlling your display brightness, you can help reduce battery drain.
* To play around with your display options, go to Settings → Display & Brightness.

* With Touch ID being as fast as it is, it’s really not much of a hassle anymore to unlock our devices when they lock automatically.
* You should take advantage of the shorter auto lock feature so your display doesn’t stay on for any longer than it needs to. Being on too long, or leaving it on by accident, is going to impact your battery significantly.
* You can configure the auto lock feature from Settings → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock.

* Apple’s latest handsets can respond to being picked up from a table surface or being pulled out of your pocket by turning the display on automatically.
* The feature, known as Raise to Wake, utilizes the accelerometer sensor, as well as your display, which both impact battery usage. This feature isn’t perfect and it tends to wake the display even at times when we don’t want it to, so sometimes it’s just a battery waster.
* You can change your Raise to Wake settings under Settings → Display & Brightness → Raise to Wake.

* Having things running in the background all the time will use up more power. Unless you have the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus with that super power efficient A10 Fusion chip, you may be using a lot more power than necessary by using background app refresh.
* Disabling background app refresh entirely, or at least for the apps that don’t really need to refresh their data in the background, should significantly improve your device’s battery life.
* Control your background app refresh settings from Settings → General → Background App Refresh.

* The more apps you have phoning home for notifications, the more battery life your iPhone or iPad is going to burn through to deliver them to you.
* Try limiting notifications to apps that are essential throughout your day so your device isn’t always checking for new data and waking up your display to notify you of things.
* You can control your notification settings in Settings → Notifications.

* The lower your cellular signal gets, the harder your iPhone has to work to keep in touch with the cellular tower.
* Enabling Wi-Fi Calling on your iPhone allows your device to connect to nearby Wi-Fi networks for phone calls instead of trying to power through a low signal strength with your carrier. Keep in mind however that not all carriers support Wi-Fi calling, so ensure your carrier supports the feature first.
* You can enable Wi-Fi Calling from Settings → Phone → Wi-Fi Calling.

* Enabled by default are automatic downloads, which automatically install apps on your device that you’ve installed on your other devices, as well as updates for any apps you have installed.
* By keeping this feature on, you not only force iOS to check for updates in the background, which uses battery juice, but you also allow services like Facebook to force unwanted features down your throat. You may want to turn this off entirely, or at least disable some of the features to help conserve battery.
* You can change your automatic download settings in Settings → iTunes & App Stores.

* The more wireless activity your iPhone or iPad experiences, the more battery it’s going to use. If you foresee this being a problem, try to limit wireless radio usage by disabling cellular data or Wi-Fi when you don’t need them.
* You can also toggle Airplane Mode from Control Center, a method of battery savings that a popular jailbreak tweak called Airplane Enhancer showed was very effective, when you don’t need access to the internet at all. You can always reconnect when you need to use your device.

* Whenever you want to save some extra battery juice on your iPhone, you can always turn on the trusty Low Power Mode feature, which limits features like Mail fetch, Hey Siri, app backgrounding, downloads, and visual effects to reduce power consumption.
* You can enable this feature manually even when your battery is at 100% to conserve power from the start of your day, all the way to the end of it.
* You can turn on Low Power Mode from Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode.

* The Apple Watch is intended to be an accessory you can use alongside your iPhone, and it can handle a lot of tasks, like notifications, while reducing the load on your iPhone and taking some of the battery abuse instead.
* Using your Apple Watch reduces display usage on your iPhone, which overall can yield improvements to your iPhone’s battery life and still get your tasks done.
* The logic behind this tip is the tried and true “divide and conquer” method, which just so happens to work with saving your battery too.

* Apple eliminated the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, but they still include a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box. If you’re going to be listening to music a lot, you may want to use wired headphones instead of wireless ones.
* According to Apple’s tech specs, wireless audio playback uses more power than the typical audio playback we see on earlier iPhones. It can make a difference of anywhere from 10-20 hours. Bluetooth is very efficient, but it’s still not as efficient as a hardwired connection.

* Apple regularly releases software updates for its iOS operating system that improve its efficiency and squash potentially battery-hungry bugs. Make sure you’re always running the latest version of iOS to ensure you have the best software available.
* You can update your version of iOS from Settings → General → Software Updates.
