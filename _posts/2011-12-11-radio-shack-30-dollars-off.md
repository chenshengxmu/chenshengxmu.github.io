* Folks that missed out on all of the Black Friday festivities will be happy to hear that retailers aren’t quite done discounting Apple products yet. Yesterday, we told you about some major iPad deals going on over at Apple.com, and now we’ve come across some other specials.
* It appears that Radio Shack, one of America’s largest electronics retailers, is discounting most of its AT&T-branded smartphones this month. The sale covers Android handsets by top manufacturers like HTC and Sony, and also includes the iPhone 4 and 4S…
* Electronista is reporting that starting today, Radio Shack is offering $30 off both the iPhone 4 and the new iPhone 4S via instant discounts. This makes the 16GB model iPhone 4S just $169.99 with a two year contract, and knocks the 8GB iPhone 4 down to $69.

* The sale ends December 17th, and is obviously limited to stock on hand. As most of you know, retailers have had a hard time keeping the iPhone 4S in stock. But if your local store has them, this will likely be the best deal you’ll see this year on Apple’s two most popular handsets.
