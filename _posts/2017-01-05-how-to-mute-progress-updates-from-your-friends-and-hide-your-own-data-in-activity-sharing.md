* Activity sharing is a tried and tested way to boost your app engagement by pitting your own fitness data against others that are willing to share theirs. Fitbit and Nike knew for a while of the extra motivation released when someone else monitors your activity, Apple knows full well since iOS 10 and watchOS 3. Agreeing to share and relay your activity on Apple Watch can hence be an inspirational thing, but it also results in a considerable increase of wrist-buzzing every day.
* The following tutorial on no account is an insider’s tip, however if you have committed to sharing your activity and your patience with the daily activity updates from your friend is starting to wear thin, remember that there is an option to mute those notifications. The tutorial, or reminder (depending on your level of knowledge), also demonstrates how to hide your own activity from that friend, in case you don’t want them to know about your newest calories crushing workout just yet.
* As a matter of course, the amount of progress updates and notifications pouring in on your Apple Watch are always relative to the activity levels of your friends, meaning a couch potato friend is not going to produce as many buzzes on your own wrist as a fitness junkie pal. If you have signed up to share your data with someone of the more sportive kind though, you will have noticed that the daily count can easily exceed a handful of notifications.

* If this sounds all too familiar and you are getting tired of the influx of updates (or feeling guilty at the constant reminder of somebody outperforming you), luckily the Activity app on iPhone provides the remedy you are looking for. What’s more is that you are given not one, but two options to deal with your friend(s): either block the barrage of incoming notifications or hide your own activity from a particular contact, excluding the person from your analytics and the notifications your own app sends out. Since these two choices are interlaced, the guide below exhibits them in one go:
* Apple thus far is not offering a shortcut to tinker with your friends’ progress updates on the watch itself, so you will have to resort to your iPhone’s Activity app before we can begin.
* 1) Once opened on your iPhone, tap the Sharing button in the bottom right corner of your interface.

* 2) Select the friend inundating you with notifications. It does not matter what day you select (present or past) to get to the menu we are after. In my case, Christoph’s activity is seriously chipping away at my ego and it needs to stop.

* 3) After selecting the contact, scroll downward to unveil the submenu that might just become your saving grace.

* 4) Red on black and right below Christoph’s achievements today, the options read Mute Notifications and Hide my Activity. According to whether you like to just stop the progress updates or want to go in stealth mode yourself, tap either option.

* Remember that whatever you choose, it will only apply to this friend of yours. If you are sharing your activity with multiple contacts that means a good deal of customisability concerning who you want to be fully transparent with. As far as the Hide my Activity tab is concerned, activating it is going to prompt a grey remark noting You hid your Activity data from your friend at x:xx o’clock. Be aware that this is merely a temporary ban. As soon as it is lifted, your full data is going to be accessible again by said friend.
* Now enjoy the serenity, sit back and open that bag of chips you have been eyeballing for the last twenty minutes. No one will know!
