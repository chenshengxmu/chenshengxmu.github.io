* After more than a year of waiting, and months of teasing, Gameloft has finally confirmed a release date for ‘Modern Combat 5: Blackout.’ The highly anticipated title is going to be landing on iOS and Android devices on Thursday, July 24th.
* Gameloft first unveiled MC5 at E3 last year and then went silent on the game for several months. Then, in April of this year, it began posting new details, screenshots and trailers for the title. Here’s everything we know about MC5 thus far…
* From the April press release:
* Modern Combat 5: Blackout will once again take fans on an adventure across the globe, as the player engages in special counter-terrorism operations with the latest and most technologically advanced combat weaponry. The single-player campaign for MC5: Blackout consists of compact and dynamic missions that ratchet up the suspense of each action-packed moments. The development team wanted players to experience the story in a more intense and diverse way than ever before.
* Like fans have seen in some of the earlier demos, the story will indeed begin in Venice, Italy where Phoenix, the main character of the game, is sent on a special operation to secure a transport of WMDs from a particularly well-armed terrorist group. From there the plot will take gamers on a globe-trotting adventure, including a particularly harrowing sequence in Tokyo where Phoenix has to fight amidst total anarchy while trying to convince his allies to accept an uncomfortable secret. By the end, players will have experienced a range of visually-stunning settings, and thrilling action-packed combat sequences. 
* And here are a few screenshots:

* And finally, this year’s E3 trailer:
* Those who have played MC5 say it feels a lot like its predecessors, but with much better graphics. Other changes include an all-new unified progression system, and a new multiplayer mode that allows you to join squads with your friends.
* The good news is, the game will be priced at $6.99 with no in-app purchases. The bad news is, it looks like it’s still going to require an Internet connection. We’ll be sure to let you know as soon as Modern Combat 5: Blackout hits the App Store.
