* An earlier report from Japanese blog Macotakara alleged that the next iPhone might bring out a new deep blue color option, later described as being closer to a “dark Space Black,” similar to that used for the Space Black stainless stell Apple Watch.
* Be that as it may, a new video from Lewis Hilsenteger of Unbox Therapy shows off an iPhone 7 mockup with kind of blue-ish, purple-ish tone to it. It’s “a very unusual color for Apple and it doesn’t exist anywhere else in the product line,” says Hilsenteger.
* This iPhone 7 Plus mockup was produced by a Chinese company called BeSound, which is working on Lightning-based earbuds for the iPhone 7.
* Other than the blue-ish finish, this mockup also gives us our best view of other rumored features of the upcoming handset, including a dual-lens system that will likely be absent in the standard iPhone 7, and three vertical pins on the backside that may suggest a Smart Connector or wireless charging.
* Other notes of interest include a pair of speaker grilles and no headphone jack at the bottom, a protruding dual camera with a curvature to it on the backside and subtler antenna lines that only run across the top and bottom of the device.
* Would it be cool to see an iPhone in this shade?
