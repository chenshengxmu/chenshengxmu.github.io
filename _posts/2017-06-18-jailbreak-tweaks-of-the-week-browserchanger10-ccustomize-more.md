* Things have been picking up in the jailbreak community lately, which is great for those who want to try new jailbreak tweaks to trick out their devices. While some tweaks exist to make iOS look better, and others make iOS function in new ways, all jailbreak tweaks serve some kind of purpose to the tune of making your device do more out of the box.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released this week, starting with all of our favorites and then moving on to the rest afterwards.

* When you choose a new default web browser, it will open instead of Safari any time you tap on a link from another one of your apps.
* BrowserChanger works on iOS 10 devices and is compatible with six different web browsers, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
