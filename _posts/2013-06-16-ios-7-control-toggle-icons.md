* iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons is a new jailbreak theme that brings iOS 7 inspired toggles to lesser firmware. The toggles, based on those that appear in iOS 7’s new Control Center, help bring the look and feel of iOS 7 to jailbroken iPhones.
* Designed by renowned designer, Surenix, the toggle theme integrates with NCSettings, and requires WinterBoard. It’s also been recommended that you add a blur effect tweak to the Notification Center window, further emulating the signature style of iOS 7.
* I’ve installed iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons on my iPhone, and I’d like to show you how it all comes together. Check out our hands on video walkthrough after the break…
* After installing the theme, you’ll need to venture into WinterBoards’s settings to enable the theme. Once the theme is enabled, head into the stock Settings app and locate the preferences for NCSettings. Select the theme selection under the Appearance section, and enable the iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons theme.
* Now, when you slide down Notification Center to expose NCSettings, it should showcase this new theme, which looks very similar to iOS 7’s Control Center. To further replicate iOS 7, Surenix recommends adding a blur effect tweak for Notification Center to the mix. I decided to use Ryan Petrich’s FastBlurredNotificationCenter tweak, which, in my opinion, works best. You can find that package on Petrich’s beta repo: http://rpetri.ch/repo/.
* iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons is a great looking theme for NCSettings users. Even if you’ve never used NCSettings in the past, now you have even more of a reason to do so. Best of all, iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons is a free theme available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. In fact, all of the packages required for this look, NCSettings, iOS 7 Control Toggle Icons, WinterBoard, and FastBlurredNotificationCenter, are free of charge on Cydia. Let me know what you think about this new theme in the comment section below.
