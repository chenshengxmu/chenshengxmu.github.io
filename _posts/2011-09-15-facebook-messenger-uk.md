* When Facebook entered the murky waters of the instant messaging business with Facebook Messenger, many eyebrows were raised by its US-only launch. With over 700 million users worldwide, that left a fair chunk unable to take advantage of Facebook’s latest venture.
* As of now, that’s an issue that’s on its way to being addressed, with Facebook Messenger now being made available in the U.K. App Store…
* Priced at the same low, low price of free, Facebook’s U.K. app is identical to its US brother; it offers a way of accessing and sending Facebook Messages without venturing into the official Facebook app. If you’re the kind of person that loses hours on Facebook, then that’s a winner right there.
* There’s been no official word why the app was US-only in the first place, or why the app isn’t available worldwide yet, but we suspect it’s all a case of managing the load on Facebook’s systems, and that Facebook users worldwide will eventually be able to get in on the action.
