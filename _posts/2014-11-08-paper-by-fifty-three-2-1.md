* FiftyThree has updated its popular Paper app this weekend, bringing it to version 2.1. The update is significant in that it adds a handful of major features such as push notifications for Mix, and the ability to export drawings to Adobe’s Creative Cloud.
* Pulled out of beta last month, Mix is a collaboration platform that offers templates, outlines, tools and tutorials for users to openly share projects. When launched, the feature would send you alerts you via email, but now it sends them via notifications.
* The new Adobe integration is perhaps the biggest addition here, though. The ability to export drawings to Creative Cloud allows users to sketch something on their iPad, and then send it directly to Photoshop or Illustrator applications on their computer.
* Rounding out the 2.1 update is a variety of iOS 8 improvements, smoother shadowing, and a new live camera view in account setup. You can grab the latest version of Paper by FiftyThree in the App Store for free (IAPs). Unfortunately, it’s still iPad-only.
