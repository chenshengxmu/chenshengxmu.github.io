* It’s been 6 days now since I got the iPad 2 and I have to say that I am more than satisfied with it. I wrote a pretty extensive review of the iPad 2 on our sister site, z iPad Blog, which hopefully will be helpful to some of you.
* I usually don’t cross post anything from one of our sites to another but I thought this review was worth mentioning here on iDB. Besides, most of you probably don’t know we also run an iPad blog so this is the perfect occasion to promote this side project of ours. Make sure to check it out and subscribe to the RSS feed or the Twitter account.
