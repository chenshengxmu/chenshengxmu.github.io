* On Tuesday, March 13, Apple announced the forthcoming WWDC 2018, held June 4-8 in San Jose. The annual event announces updates to macOS, iOS, and tvOS. Sometimes, we get to see some updated hardware too!
* As with all Apple events, a media invitation is sent out to the community, at which point everyone attempts to find clues in the design. More importantly, the iDB wallpaper group gets to work, designing invitation-inspired wallpapers for your iOS devices.
* The first three designs are original works by @basvanderploeg, which were initially released by iCulture. A more liberal inspiration in a black theme comes from iDB fan favorite @AR72014. For more awesome wallpapers from AR72014, follow him on Twitter or check out his iDB gallery.
