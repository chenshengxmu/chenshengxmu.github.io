* Anyone without an unlimited data plan knows about the struggle of working inside a carrier’s tiny cap allotments. While plenty of App Store apps exist that can help you track data usage, a new jailbreak tweak called Membrane by iOS developer candoizo can take things even further.
* Membrane integrates directly with the Cellular preference pane in the Settings app to give you fine-grained control over what apps connect to the internet over a cellular connection, and which ones don’t. It also provides real-time information to keep you alert about how you’re using all of your data.
* As you probably know already, iOS lets you turn cellular data on or off for individual apps on your device, but this can be a tedious process. Membrane enables you to allow ‘temporary’ cellular data usage for an app, which becomes revoked the moment you close said app.
* As shown above, opening an app that can’t access the internet via cellular data while you’re connected to a cellular network causes the iOS prompt to display the “Enable Temporarily” option.
* Membrane also lets you input your unique data plan information, such as the data allotment you can use every month and when your cycle refreshes into the ticker.
* With these tools, you can view how much data you have left before reaching your cap from Settings → Cellular → Membrane. The tweak automatically refreshes this information in real time as you use your data:

* Membrane’s deep integration into iOS’ native Cellular options makes it more powerful than most App Store apps, which monitor your data usage and nothing more. That said, I love the direct integration and new features, and I’m sure you will too.
* If you’re serious about saving data and want to keep regular tabs on your data usage, then you might want to give Membrane a try. After all, it might reveal if your service provider is over-charging you for cellular data usage.
* I can see Membrane being useful for anyone with capped data plans, but not as much for those with unlimited data plans. The tweak is available for $1.29 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository, and it works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices with cellular data capabilities.
