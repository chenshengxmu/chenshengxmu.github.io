title: DummyPass trumps over-shoulder peeping attempts on your passcode

* If you use a passcode to unlock your iPhone or iPad, then you know how important it is to keep other people from seeing the digits you tap on to get into your device.
* Since people are inclined to pay more attention to the numbers you tap rather than the pattern of the buttons, a new free jailbreak tweak called DummyPass by iOS developer Wisy uses this concept to your advantage.
* It will randomize your passcode button positions every time you unlock your device, shifting them from their stock locations. But here’s the real kicker: even though the numbers get a different keypad position, you still have to follow the same button pattern your passcode would typically exhibit on a stock keypad to successfully unlock the device.
* For example: if your passcode is 2468, you would still follow the top → left → right → bottom button pattern even though the keys will display different numbers than “2468” every time your device is unlocked:

* The tweak diverts the unsuspecting user into tapping on the wrong passcode buttons, hence yielding a failure to unlock and an additional layer of security for you.
* Even if you use Touch ID instead of manual passcode entry, the tweak can be useful. Anyone who doesn’t have access to your fingerprint will be forced to enter a passcode anyway. With that in mind, it can trick people with malicious intent into entering the wrong passcode.
* Another thing: since your brain is probably accustomed to tapping a particular pattern on the passcode keypad anyways, the tweak shouldn’t impact your regular usage in any way. Instead, it has the potential to thwart attempts by over-the-shoulder peepers to steal your passcode.
* With no options to configure, DummyPass is a straightforward tweak that can be downloaded free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. While it might not be for everyone, I would certainly consider using it on my own device. It’s compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
