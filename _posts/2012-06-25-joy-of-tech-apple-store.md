* You’re no doubt aware of The New York Times’ coverage of Apple’s retailing woes and Cupertino’s response: it raised wages and is mulling a career path for employees. The story is making the headlines and becoming a meme, so it goes without saying that Joy of Tech has a take on it.
* Joy of Tech is a webcomic created by Canada-born Liza Schmalcel and Bruce Evans and iDB loves their funny takes on the various topics that have been occupying the greatest minds in tech (yeah, I meant that as an irony).
* My favorite from their Apple Store comic: before putting on an Apple Genius shirt, please apply “New Apple Smell” scented deodorant, as instructed by your Hygiene Manager. What, didn’t you know? that there’s a fragrance which recreates the Apple unboxing scent?
* Here’s your comic.

* By the way, they aren’t joking about the rule #1: Don’t touch anyone’s iPhone before asking for a permission.
* As noted in the controversial New York Times article from Saturday:
* There is more role-playing at Core training, as it’s known, this time with pointers on the elaborate etiquette of interacting with customers. One rule: ask for permission before touching anyone’s iPhone.
* Another interesting rule: don’t promise you can fix the problem.
* “And we told trainees that the first thing they needed to do was acknowledge the problem, though don’t promise you can fix the problem,” said Shane Garcia, the one-time Chicago manager.
* “If you can, let them know that you have felt some of the emotions they are feeling. But you have to be careful because you don’t want to lie about that.”
* What’s your favorite secret from the Apple Store Employee Rule Book?
