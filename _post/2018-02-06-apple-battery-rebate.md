* Apple is reportedly considering offering rebates to customers who purchased replacement lithium-ion batteries for their iPhone before the discounted pricing came into effect.
* In the wake of a controversy about its practice of slowing down older handsets, Apple announced in December that it’s cutting the price of out-of-warranty battery replacements from $79 down to just $29 a pop. The discounted pricing is valid until December 31, 2018.
* Recode reported Tuesday that Apple has responded to an open letter by Republican lawmaker Senator John Thune who has been investigating the throttling issue.

* Thune sought answers from Apple, asking in his letter this January if the Cupertino firm has considered whether or not those who paid the non-discounted price for a replacement battery should be allowed to seek a rebate for some of the purchase price.
* Cynthia Hogan, Apple’s Vice President in charge of public policy in the Americas, responded to Thune today by saying, “Yes, we are exploring this and will update you accordingly.”
* Have you yet taken advantage of Apple’s discounted battery pricing?
