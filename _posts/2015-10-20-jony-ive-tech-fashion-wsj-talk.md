* Ahead of next year’s Apple-sponsored Met Gala, Jony Ive sat down with The Wall Street Journal to talk about the growing relationship between tech and fashion. Ive will be co-hosting the Gala in May, along with Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Winter, actor Idris Elba and pop star Taylor Swift.
* The red-carpet event is New York’s biggest fashion function of the year, and the main exhibit of 2016 will be “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.” The message is that beautiful designs can result from both craftsmanship and automation, whether created by hand or machine.
* “It’s a completely false notion that there is inherent value in what is made by hand, or an inherent lack of value in what is made by machine,” Ive told The Journal. “As products become more personal, something that is worn on the wrist put us in the space of fashion. These are issues close to our hearts. Our understanding will temper and define future products we’re working on. We’re only starting.”
* For Manus x Machina, the Metropolitan Museum of Art plans to feature more than three dozen designers and 100 items of clothing. Galleries will include a suite of rooms reflecting traditional couture workshops (knitting, embroidery, etc.), as well as cutting edge technologies like 3-D printing.
