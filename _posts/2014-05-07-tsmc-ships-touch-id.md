* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s top semiconductor foundry, has reportedly shipped the first batch of the second-generation Touch ID sensors to Apple for use in the upcoming second-generation iPad Air, third-generation iPad mini and of course iPhone 6.
* As iDownloadBlog exclusively reported earlier this month, code fragments in iOS 7.1 indicate that Touch ID is coming to iPads, possibly this year and to other iOS devices as well, a discovery further corroborated by previous supply chain reports…
* Citing supply chain sources, component information outlet cecb2b.com [Google translate, via GforGames] reported Wednesday that TSMC has provided the first batch of Touch IDs for the iPhone 6, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 “sometime in mid-April”.
* The claim reportedly comes via sources inside Sazhou Crystal Semiconductor Technology Co., one of the two subcontractors to which TSMC outsourced backend production services, the other being TSMC’s subsidiary Xintec.
* Xintec was also mentioned in a DigiTimes report last August confirming that Touch ID sensors for the then unreleased iPhone 5s were being packaged by Xintec.

* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently noted that the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 should pick up Apple’s fingerprint reader.
* TSMC has been producing Touch ID sensors for the iPhone 5s at its eight-inch fabs and is believed to have started making Touch IDs for the next iPhone back in January.
* Moreover, the foundry apparently landed orders for Apple’s upcoming in-house designed A8 chip amid persisting rumors of Apple looking to break its dependency on Samsung. The South Korean giant has thus far acted as an exclusive manufacturer for Apple’s A-series processors.
