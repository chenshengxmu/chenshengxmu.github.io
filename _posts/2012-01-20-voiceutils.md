* Folks, the madness has started. One of the first jailbreak tweaks featuring custom Siri commands has officially made its way to the Cydia store, and it’s called VoiceUtils.
* VoiceUtils allows you to respring, reboot, power off, and enter safe mode — all via Siri. You’re definitely going to want to check out our video of it in action…
* VoiceUtils can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Remember, you will need a jailbroken iPhone 4S to take advantage of the tweak.
* We’re sure this is the first of many Siri tweaks in the pipeline, and in our opinion, this one isn’t a bad first attempt.
* What do you think?
