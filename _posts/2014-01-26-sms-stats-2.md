* I’ve never thought of myself as a big text messenger, but I was quite surprised to see how many text messages that I’ve sent and received over the life of my iPhone. As it turns out, I’ve sent and received a combined 17,000+ text messages—way more than I expected.
* Chances are you’ll too be surprised when you see your text message statistics, and there’s a brand new jailbreak tweak called SMS Stats 2 that makes it super easy to view them.
* Once you install SMS Stats 2, head to the Messages app and you’ll see an ‘S’ button to the left of the compose button. Tapping the ‘S’ button, which I’m assuming stands for stats, allows you to see your usage for the lifetime of your device and for the past 28 days.

* Statistics include total messages, sent messages, and received messages. SMS Stats 2 also breaks up that data between SMS messages (traditional text messages) and iMessages. If you’d like to see the data pertaining to a specific contact, head into that contact’s message thread, tap contact, and then tap the ‘S’ button.

* SMS Stats 2 is an unobtrusive way to monitor your text message usage for all of your messages and for individual contacts. There are no options or settings to configure, just install it and go.
* You can download SMS Stats 2 free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about the tweak in the comments below.
