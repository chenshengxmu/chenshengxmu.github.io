* We recently discussed transferring songs from an iPhone to your Apple Watch to enjoy music from your wrist when your phone is out of Bluetooth range or unavailable.
* When you actually stored the music on your Apple Watch, you’ll need Bluetooth headphones because the wearable gizmo doesn’t support playing songs through its built-in speaker.
* Thankfully, Apple has implemented AirPlay in Watch OS so you can easily send audio to another device.
* If you have an AirPlay-compatible receiver such as the $69 Apple TV streaming box, or one of AirPlay-enabled speakers or receivers, you can easily route audio through AirPlay.
* Step 1: Open Music on your Apple Watch by tapping its icon on the Home screen. You can also ask Siri to “Open Music” by pressing and holding the Digital Crown.
* Step 2: Browse your Playlists, Albums, Artists or Songs until you see a list of music you like. Now tap a song to play it.
* Tip: Not seeing the music you’re expecting? Switch your music source between your iPhone and Apple Watch by firmly pressing the display. Now tap Source then tap iPhone or Apple Watch.

* Step 3: When a song starts playing, the playback controls will show up on the screen. To send the music to another device, firmly press the Apple Watch’s display, tap AirPlay and then choose an AirPlay-enabled destination.
* In the example below, I decided to AirPlay audio to my Apple TV which is connected to an external speaker via optical connection.

* You can also use the Now Playing glance for basic control of your music.
* Just swipe up on your watch face, then swipe left or right to the playback controls. The Now Playing glance less you play or pause music, skip to the previous or next track and adjust volume.
* Tip: If you don’t see the Now Playing glance, open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, navigate to My Watch > Music then turn on Show in Glances.

* Keep in mind that the Now Playing glance does not support changing your music source, sending audio to another device with AirPlay, shuffling or repeating songs. For these features, turn to the actual Music app on your Apple Watch.
