* For the first time since its inception, the Online Apple Store is now accepting PayPal as a payment method in both the United States and United Kingdom, Re/code said Friday.
* The change is newsworthy in light of PayPal’s reluctance to join Apple’s mobile payment solution, Apple Pay, and refusal to update its app with Touch ID authentication.
* As can be seen on the screenshot above, PayPal appears as an option during the checkout process, after you’ve added products to your shopping basket and entered your shipping information.
* Choosing PayPal as a payment method takes you to PayPal’s website for confirmation. You’ll be then sent back to the Apple Store to complete your purchase.
* Additionally, Apple is advertising the PayPal Credit payment method which lets you pay for an item in equal monthly installments over up to 18 months with no interest.

* PayPal at the time of this writing had not surfaced as an option in the native Apple Store application for the iPhone and iPad, but should soon given the app replicates the online shopping experience.
* PayPal has long been available as one of the payment methods in the App Store, Mac App Store and iTunes. I guess this was a no-brainer for PayPal considering that Apple is the second largest online retailer in the U.S., according to Internet Retailer.
