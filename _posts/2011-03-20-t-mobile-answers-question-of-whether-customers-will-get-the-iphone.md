* AT&T announced today that they will buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion in cash and stocks. A deal that shocked, you, me, and our grandmothers.
* But what does this mean for T-Mobile subscribers? Will they finally get the iPhone? No. Well, not yet at least…
* T-Mobile has posted a Q&A answering several frequently asked questions, and one of those questions include whether T-Mobile customers will get the iPhone. Basically, T-Mobile says no.
* Is T-Mobile USA getting the iPhone?
* T-Mobile USA remains an independent company. The acquisition is expected to be completed in approximately 12 months. We do not offer the iPhone. We offer cutting edge devices like the Samsung Galaxy S 4G and coming soon our new Sidekick 4G.
* It seems T-Mobile subscribers will have to stick to their unlocked iPhones’ for at least another year. T-Mobile states that it will continue to operate independently until the acquisition has been officially completed.
* Here are some more answers to questions you might have, courtesy of T-Mobile:
* Will my service change?
* There is no change in your service and we remain committed to ensuring you have the best experience possible experience using your T-Mobile USA products and services.
* Will I now be billed by AT&T?
* No, your billing remains exactly the same. T-Mobile USA continues to operate as an independent company. As always, you would receive advance notice to any changes to your services.
* Why is T-Mobile USA doing this?
* Bringing together these two world-class businesses will create significant benefits for customers. The merger will ensure the deployment of a robust 4G LTE network to 95% of the U.S. population, something neither company would achieve on its own. Also, because of our compatible networks and spectrum, the customers of T-Mobile USA and AT&T will experience improved voice and data service almost immediately after the networks are integrated.
* Will T-Mobile USA’s quality be reduced?
* No. In fact, the combination of AT&T and T-Mobile USA will offer an even stronger service to customers. Until the acquisition is closed, we will work hard to maintain our position as the value leader with America’s largest 4G network.
* If the acquisition closes, will I still be able to use my T-Mobile USA phone?
* Yes. Your T-Mobile USA device will operate the same in the future as it does today.
* Should I wait to sign-up with T-Mobile USA or upgrade my phone?
* No, T-Mobile USA offers the latest wireless devices that are affordable on America’s Largest 4G Network and the combination of AT&T and T-Mobile USA will mean even stronger service for our customers. Now is a great time to be a T-Mobile customer.
* Is T-Mobile USA getting the iPhone?
* T-Mobile USA remains an independent company. The acquisition is expected to be completed in approximately 12 months. We do not offer the iPhone. We offer cutting edge devices like the Samsung Galaxy S 4G and coming soon our new Sidekick 4G.
* Will my rate plan change because of the acquisition?
* We will honor all contracted plans that are entered into before the change of ownership.
* How does that make our T-Mobile subscribers using unlocked iPhones’ feel?
