* One of the big features many users were hoping to see in iPhone 6 was better battery life, and in some ways they got it. The iPhone 6 outlasts the iPhone 5s by 10 hours playing audio, one hour playing video and Wi-Fi browsing, and it performs much better over 3G. For the most part, however, everything else is the same.
* Then there’s the iPhone 6 Plus, which as expected, greatly exceeds the battery life of its predecessor. Note that the larger handset will play audio for double the amount of time of the 5s, will allow for more than double the amount of 3G talking, and offers an extra 6 days of standby time over both the new iPhone 6 and the 5s.
* It’s not hard to guess where the extra battery life is coming from. With the iPhone 6 Plus’ larger size, Apple was obviously able to squeeze in a much larger battery. It’s nice to see, though, that the engineering team in Cupertino was able to keep much of that extra power despite the Plus’ higher resolution 1920 x 1080 display.
