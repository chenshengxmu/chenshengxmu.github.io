* ClockSeconds is a recently released tweak that adds seconds to the clock on your iPhone’s lockscreen.
* For those of you who are keen on customization, there’s also a settings panel added to your Settings app that allows you to modify the color of the clock’s numbers.
* That’s great and all, but there is one major flaw that plagues ClockSeconds, rendering it a lot less practical. Check inside for the full lowdown on this jailbreak tweak’s shortcomings…
* As you’ve no doubt gleaned from the video, ClockSeconds fails at the very thing that it’s supposed to be good at.
* True, it adds seconds to your lockscreen clock, but those seconds are static, just like the minutes and hours. In other words, they don’t actually move like a second hand on a clock, you have to press the sleep button to refresh the seconds.
* This discrepancy makes ClockSeconds fairly useless when it comes to timing, etc. It would have been nice if it featured a bit more stopwatch functionality.
* The YouTube commentary minced few words when it came to their thoughts on ClockSeconds, and they were even able to recommend another tweak, Lock Seconds, that worked quite a bit better.
