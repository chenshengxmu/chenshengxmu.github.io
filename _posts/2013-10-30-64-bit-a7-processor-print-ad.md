* Earlier this month, Apple began running a magazine advertisement for its iPhone 5s with a byline reading “your finger is the password.” It briefly explained some of the benefits of Apple’s new Touch ID security system.
* Well new iPhone 5s print ad has surfaced this week, this time highlighting Apple’s new 64-bit A7 processor. Similar to the previous spot, the ad features a large photo of the 5s and a byline: “Desktop Power. Pocket Size.”
* Here’s the full ad courtesy of 9to5Mac:

* “We do everything on our phones. That’s why the new A7 chip was designed to handle, well, anything. It puts 64-bit desktop architecture in your palm, a first for any smartphone. You get stunning, true-to-life graphics and up to 2x faster performance without sacrificing all-day battery life. The A7 chip. Only on iPhone 5s.”
* Of note, Apple has taken some criticism over its 64-bit claim, with some folks calling it a “marketing gimmick.” Yes, those folks have since been reprimanded, but many users have wondered out loud what its real-life benefits are.
* So I guess in that regard, this is an easy way for Apple to control the conversation, as the ad does a great job of explaining what the 64-bit A7 means for customers: faster performance, all-day battery life, the future of smartphones.
* What do you think of the 5s ad?
