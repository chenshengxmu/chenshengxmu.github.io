* iOS 7 includes some pretty exciting new provisions to cater to gamers, including new gamepad support that developers can take advantage of. A number of developers have already baked gamepad support into their updated app releases.
* Although an officially certified iOS 7 compatible controller has yet to hit the market, many hardware manufactures have expressed interest in the feature. Logitech is one of the hardware developers interested in iOS 7 gamepad support, and its new gamepad was just leaked by popular mobile phone website evleaks.

* I’m not sure about the ergonomics of this thing, but I personally can’t wait to try it. This is Apple’s first real direct challenge to traditional handheld powers Sony and Nintendo. It’ll be interesting to see how it’s received.
* I do wish Apple would go ahead and make its own controller, as it would be no doubt second to none. In the meantime, we’ll have to make do with 3rd party controllers like the one shown above. What do you think?
