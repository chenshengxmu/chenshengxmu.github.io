* Once you’ve made the decision to purchase the iPhone 8, the next thing you’ll want to consider is what kind of case you’re going to get for it. With a starting price tag of $700, and an all-new glass-covered design, you’re definitely going to want to get some protection for your new handset.
* There are several types of cases already available for the new iPhones, including thinner slim-fit cases, bulkier rugged cases, and those with built-in credit card slots meant to replace your wallet. So we decided to round up some of our favorites in an effort to help you out with your selection.
* Wondering if a case will disable your new iPhone’s wireless charging feature? The answer is no. Wireless charging works just fine with most* cases, although case thickness and charging pad brand can affect performance.

* Whenever a new iPhone comes out, one of the first brands I look to for cases is Totallee. I like the Scarf because it’s well-made, has a minimal, logo-less design, and it’s ultra-thin. It’s so thin, in fact, that I wouldn’t count on it to protect your phone from any significant drops. Think of it more like a skin (that you can easily add/remove) that protects your device from bumps and scratches.
* Buy for $18 (sale price). Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.

* If you’re looking for something that offers a little more protection, I recommend checking out the Speck Presidio. Speck is another brand that I look to for cases when a new iPhone drops, and the Presidio is among my favorites. It’s thick enough that it should help your device survive minor drops and bumps, but not so thick that it’s a burden. I also like the extra grippy texture on the back, the slight lip over the display, and the subtle design. It’s a bit on the expensive side, especially compared to some of our other picks, but I think you get a premium case for the premium price tag.
* Buy for $40. Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.

* The Spigen Ultra Hybrid is another solid case that I think hits the sweet-spot between thinness and protection. As its name suggests, it features a hybrid construction made of a shock-absorbing, rigid bumper and a transparent, plastic back. The cutouts for the rear camera and mute switch are very precise, and the button covers are ultra-responsive and help keep out the dirt and grime. The design is again very subtle, free from busy graphics or patterns. Plus, thanks to the rigid bumper, this case should protect your iPhone from most normal drops.
* Buy for $12 (sale price). Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.

* For those in need of serious protection, I recommend checking out the OtterBox Defender Series. This case has long been a staple in the rugged case space, thanks to its triple-layer defense construction made up of an inner shell, an outer shell cover and a built-in (touchscreen-friendly) screen protector. This is the real deal here—the case has everything from port covers to block dirt and debris, to a complementary holster, with a belt clip that doubles as a kickstand. The Defender Series case is OtterBox-certified for drop protection and comes with a lifetime warranty.
* Buy for $24 (sale price). Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.

* Silk has quietly become one of the most prolific case sellers on Amazon, offering a wide selection of designs for various smartphones. I particularly like their Vault Slim Wallet case for the iPhone. Sure there are thousands of wallet cases out there, but this one features a slim plastic design with a shock-absorbent reinforced ribbed structure for added protection. It also has high-grip textured sides, and you can store up to 3 cards and cash in the rear wallet slot. A handy thumb hole helps you pick out and access the card you want. The bottom line is this case should provide ample protection from drops, and allows you to leave your wallet behind.
* Buy for $15. Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.

* If you want a simple, well-designed case that is guaranteed to fit your iPhone, why not get a case directly from the maker of the handset? That’s right, Apple makes cases. And having owned a few myself, I can vouch for their quality. This is the silicone model, so it has this nice soft, silky-grippy texture to it on the outside. And on the inside there is this soft microfiber lining to help protect your phone from scratches. It’s fairly thin, so don’t expect a ton of protection from this case, but it should be enough to keep aways scratches and bumps from minor drops.
* Buy for $28 (sale price). Also available for the iPhone 8 Plus.
* Obviously these aren’t ALL of the cases available for the iPhone 8. But we wanted to provide a short, curated list of cases we know to be solid. If you think we missed something worth mentioning, tell us in the comments below!
