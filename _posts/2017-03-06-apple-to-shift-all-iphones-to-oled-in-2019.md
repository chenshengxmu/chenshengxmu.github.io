* Apple is expected to use organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for all new iPhones in 2019, according to a report Monday by The Bell. Meanwhile, suppliers Samsung Electro-Mechanics (a parts unit of Samsung) and Interflex are allegedly boosting production of flexible printed circuit boards (FPCB) for iPhone 8, the first iPhone to adopt OLED display technology.
* Apple should use OLED screens on about 60 million iPhone units this year and double the adoption next year. By 2019, all iPhones should use power-sipping OLED screens.
* The story corroborates analyst reports calling for three new iPhone models in 2017: the OLED-based iPhone 8 packed with advanced technologies and boasting an all-new industrial design and the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.
* Nikkei backed The Bell’s report, saying today that the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 model would use OLEDs while other smaller models would come outfitted with liquid crystal displays.
* To build FCPBs for iPhone 8, Samsung Electro-Mechanics is expanding capacity at its $88 million Vietnamese plant, while Interflex plans a new $86 million investment in the production later this year. Another supplier, BH, is said to enter Apple’s supply chain for iPhone 8 FCPBs later this year.
* “Orders for each supplier will be decided when the production starts in April or May,” reads the report.
