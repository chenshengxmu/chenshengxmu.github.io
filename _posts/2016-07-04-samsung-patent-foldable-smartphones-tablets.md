* Last month, Bloomberg ran a high-profile story about Samsung’s alleged initiative, code-named Project Valley, that would bring a pair of fully bendable Galaxy phones to market in early-2017.
* Subsequent supply chain reports have since backed the story partially as it became public knowledge that Samsung has allocated north of $7 billion into boosting production of flexible OLED panels.
* As Patently Apple noted today, a new patent application sheds more light on the South Korean conglomerate’s interest in creating a technology that would allow a smartphone or tablet to fold in half when not in use.
* Samsung originally filed this patent application back in November 2015. A revised patent application was filed for in Korea two weeks ago and published on Thursday. Both filings outline a fully foldable smartphone or tablet that has a camera on the back, a bendable display and a sturdier frame with a built-in hinge.
* A user would unlock and unfold the device by simultaneously touching a user icon on one edge of the display area and an icon for inputting a password, which may be displayed on the other edge of the foldable display.
* “If the foldable device determines that the user icon and the number icon which are selected by a touch input correspond to each other, the foldable device releases a locked state of the foldable device and displays a wallpaper on the flexible display,” reads the patent abstract.
* The user interface would automatically rearrange itself based on the direction in which the foldable device is being viewed.

* It’s unclear if the rumored device will become part of Samsung’s Galaxy range, but Korean news site ETNews reported in April 2016 that it’s known internally as a “smartlet” and sports a 7-inch screen when unfolded.
* A few years back, Samsung publicly showed off its flexible OLED screens though its interest in the technology dates as far back as 2011.
* At the recent SID 2016 event in San Francisco, Samsung demonstrated a 5.7-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080 pixels) AMOLED flexible screen, pictured top of post. Because it uses extremely thin plastics, instead of glass, the display could be bent and rolled up without shattering: it’s just 0.3mm thin and has 10R rolling radius.

* Industry sources suspected at the time that Apple would be one of the handset makers asking Samsung to provide them flexible screens. Here’s a conceptual video created in 2014 in which Samsung lays out its vision for flexible smartphones and tablets.
* The Apple Watch is currently the sole Apple device that has a flexible OLED screen.
* According to Bloomberg last month, flexible Samsung phones could be bent and folded in half “like a cosmetic compact,” without damage. One of the devices is reportedly a five-inch model that could be opened to an eight-inch tablet size.
* Curiously enough, Samsung has reportedly removed on of the biggest obstacles which has prevented full-scale commercialization of 100 percent bendable mobile devices—making transparent plastics and making them durable.
* The news gathering organization added that Samsung could launch its first fully bendable smartphone ahead of Mobile World Congress, which runs from February 27 through March 2, 2017.
