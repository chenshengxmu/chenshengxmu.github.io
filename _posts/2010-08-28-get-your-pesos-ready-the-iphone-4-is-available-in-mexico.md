* Both the 16 and 32 GB have been released and are powered by a 3.5G HDSPA internet connection. 3 different plans have been released by Telcel for those wishing to own a piece of smartphone historyâ€¦
* Maz Messenger shows us the details:
* The site states that the bloggers in Mexico have (predictably) started to complain about the prices that they say are exuberant. For those without their currency convertors handy, 2,500 pesos equals about $200.
* If you ask me I think that getting a free iPhone for signing a $100 contract is a pretty sweet deal. Do you think these prices are fair?
