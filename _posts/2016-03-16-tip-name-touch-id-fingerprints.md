* On iPhones and iPads outfitted with Apple’s fingerprint identity sensor, you can set Touch ID to purchase App Store apps, pay for in-store items with Apple Pay, unlock private data in third-party apps, get into the device by scanning your fingerprint and more.
* Enrolling multiple fingers is a great way to improve Touch ID accuracy and make your experience better. By default, iOS names each new fingerprint as “Fingerprint 1,” “Fingerprint 2,” “Fingerprint 3” and so forth.
* Thankfully, you can rename your saved prints to something more descriptive so you can quickly distinguish them.
* 1) Launch Settings on your iPhone or iPad.
* 2) Tap Touch ID & Passcode in the top-level menu and type in your passcode to access the section.
* 3) Tap a saved fingerprint to rename it.

* Tip: To delete a fingerprint, swipe it and then tap the hidden Delete button.
* To use Touch ID instead of your Apple ID password for making purchases in the iTunes Store, App Store and iBooks Store, make sure iTunes & App Store is turned on under Settings → Touch ID & Passcode.

* If you cannot enable this feature, double check that you are signed in with your Apple ID and password in Settings → iTunes & App Store. It’s also worth mentioning that Apple cautions users that each new registered finger “might make fingerprint recognition take slightly longer” so that’s something worth keeping in mind.
