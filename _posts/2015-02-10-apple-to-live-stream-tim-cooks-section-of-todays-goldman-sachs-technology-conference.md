* Apple announced this morning it’ll be providing a live-stream audio of CEO Tim Cook’s segment at Goldman Sachs Technology Conference.
* The live webcast will be available later today over here, beginning at 12:30pm PT / 3:30pm ET. The company did not reveal the topics of Cook’s conference talk nor the form of the interview.
* But don’t you worry, you can count on iDownloadBlog to keep you in the loop regarding newsworthy tidbits Cook will be hopefully dropping during his segment.
* Streaming audio requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 4.2 or above, a Mac using Safari running on OS X 10.6.8 or above or a Windows PC using Internet Explorer, Firefox or 32-bit Chrome running QuickTime 7 or later.
* For what it’s worth, Cook — who attended these conferences back in 2012 and 2013 — did reveal some interesting and previously unknown details about Apple’s design and innovation strategies, iPhone numbers, retail concepts and other tidbits.
* And as you could imagine, he also made some rather vague comments about the future of Apple’s “hobby project,” the venerable Apple TV.
* Stay tuned as our team will be publishing highlights from Cook’s speech in an easily digestible form later in the day.
