* Lithium Ion is a new free jailbreak tweak that provides you with nearly limitless customization of the battery indicator in your Status Bar on any of your jailbroken devices.
* With this tweak, you can choose from new colors and themes for the indicator and apply them faster than you can say “done.” Plenty of themes are included out of the box that you can pick from and then further customize with different colors depending on your current battery level, and you don’t even need Winterboard to do it.
* Also nice about Lithium Ion is you can save multiple different profiles, which are essentially saved themes you’ve created. A theme consists of a specific color and theme combination of your choice. By having more than one profile, you can easily switch from one look to another on the fly.
* Everything can be configured from Settings → Lithium Ion after installing the tweak from Cydia:

* There are some other miscellaneous customization options too, such as hiding or showing the charging bolt icon in the Status Bar when you’re connected to power and enabling or disabling the charging color when connected to a power source, all of which can be configured to your liking.
* All settings change in real time, so you won’t have to respring your device every time you make changes. So in terms of convenience, Lithium Ion has it where it counts and lets you see what you’re doing as you do it.
* The developer notes there are more than 20 themes to pick from, but anyone with a little JavaScript programming knowledge can go in and create even more. Moreover, developers who’ve made themes for Lithium before will be able to port their themes over to Lithium Ion very easily.
* If you’re interested in trying Lithium Ion, or are interested in updating one of your themes from Lithium to support the new tweak, it can be downloaded for free on any jailbroken device from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now.
