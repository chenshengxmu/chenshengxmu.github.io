* The smack talk between Apple and Motorola continues, as Motorola president Rick Osterloh called out Apple for “outrageous prices” in an interview published by the BBC on Wednesday.
* “We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you’ve got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices. We think that’s not the future,” Osterloh said. “We believe the future is in offering similar experiences and great consumer choice at accessible prices.”
* Osterloh’s comments follow a piece on famed Apple designer Jony Ive in the New Yorker, where Ive called out Motorola (not by name) for its design practices with the Moto X smartphone that allows customers to choose the design.
* “Their value proposition was ‘Make it whatever you want. You can choose whatever color you want.’ And I believe that’s abdicating your responsibility as a designer,” Ive said.
* Last quarter, Apple reported profit of $18 billion.
