title: Get up to $200 off the new MacBook Pro + no tax outside NY

* Folks in the market for Apple’s new MacBook Pro will want to check out this sale going on at BHPhoto right now. The popular online retailer is offering significant deals on 13.3-inch, non-Touch Bar models with free shipping and no taxes outside New York.
* The discounts range between $100 and $200, but with no taxes that could more than double. For example, I can buy the entry-level MacBook Pro for $1,399 (normally $1,499) and also save $120 in sales tax (~8% for me). So my total savings would be $220.
* I’m not sure how long these prices are good for, but if you’ve been considering getting one of these machines, you’re not going to want to wait. Even with the holidays and Black Friday coming up, I seriously doubt you’re going find $200+ off these laptops again soon.
* Did you grab one? Let us know which one in the comments below!
