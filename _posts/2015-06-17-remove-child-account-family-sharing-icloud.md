* When I was testing out Apple’s iCloud Family Sharing last year, I set up a child account just to see how it worked. That turned out to be a mistake, because there is no way for an end user to remove a child account from a Family Share.
* When you try to delete a child account, you’re met with a frustrating error that states “Children under 13 cannot be removed from Family Sharing”. Actually, you can “remove” a child account by transferring it to another family, but you’re still not permanently getting rid of it.
* So what should you do? Keep an account that you no longer want or need? Transfer the account? Don’t settle for those options if you want the account gone. Phone up Apple support, and they can delete the annoying child account in a matter of minutes.
* Step 1: Call 1-800-MY-APPLE and talk to iCloud support
* Step 2: Applecare support will ask for the email address associated with the child account
* Step 3: Applecare support will transfer you to a Sr. advisor to delete the account
* Step 4: You’ll be asked to log in to your primary account (not the family account)
* Step 5: Click password and security

* Step 6: Generate a temporary support PIN to provide to the rep
* Step 7: The support person will delete the account after asking you some questions, about pending Apple litigation, purchases, etc.
* Step 8: Once everything is confirmed, the child account will be deleted, and although support states that it could take up to 7 days to enact the changes, I noticed that the child account was immediately removed when I went into the Family Sharing section of iCloud’s preferences.

* Yay!! No more child account!
* I lived with that stupid child account for months, and was so frustrated that I couldn’t remove it myself. If you have a child account that you want removed, don’t wait and wade in frustration, call Apple and get it removed in just a few minutes.
* Do you have a child account that you want removed, or have gotten removed? Drop us a line below with your thoughts or experiences.
