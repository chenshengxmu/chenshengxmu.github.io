* Apple on Tuesday released the second beta of iOS 11.2 to public testers. The update comes just a day after iOS 11.2 beta 2 was released to developers, and it includes a major new feature: Apple Pay Cash. The mobile payment option, first introduced at WWDC this summer, allows iOS users to send and receive money via the Messages app.
* Now you can use Apple Pay to pay and get paid right in Messages, or by asking Siri. There’s no app to download, and you can use the cards you already have in Wallet. Send money for books to your son in college. Split a bill. Pay a babysitter. Send and receive from across the table — or across the country. Instantly.
* In order to use Apple Pay Cash, Apple says you’ll need a compatible device with iOS 11.2 or later, two-factor authentication for your Apple ID, and an eligible credit or debit card in your wallet. If you meet those requirements, the feature can be set up by visiting Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Apple Pay Cash card and then follow the instructions.
* Note: There’s no fee to use Apple Pay Cash with a debit card, but you will incur the standard 3% fee if used with a credit card. Also setting up Apple Pay Cash doesn’t affect your credit in any way and it won’t be impacted by any credit freezes.
* Apple employees have been testing Apple Pay Cash internally since early October, and in addition to today’s public beta, it looks like developers running the latest iOS 11.2 beta have also received access to the feature. For what it’s worth, Apple also released the second beta of the far less significant tvOS 11.2 update to public testers today as well.
