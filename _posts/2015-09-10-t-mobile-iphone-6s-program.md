* Following Apple’s major iPhone 6s event yesterday, T-Mobile on Thursday made some big announcements of its own. In both a YouTube monologue and press release, company CEO John Legere introduced a new ‘Lifetime Coverage Guarantee’ and iPhone 6s program.
* As its name suggests, the Lifetime Coverage Guarantee essentially ensures your happiness with T-Mobile’s network. The offer says that if at any point you aren’t completely satisfied with the service on your iPhone 6s, you’ll get a refund for up to a full month of service.
* For as long as you use your iPhone 6s or 6s Plus on T-Mobile, if you aren’t completely satisfied with your coverage experience we’ll refund you for every penny you’ve paid for your new device in the first month, or after that, we’ll unlock it at no charge so you can use it with one of the other wireless companies.  We’ll even refund up to a full month of your service.  For phones that get unlocked, we’ll let you keep our standard interest-free payment plan at our standard prices.  No charge.  No hassles. 
* Legere says that all you need to do to take advantage of the new Lifetime Coverage Guarantee promotion is purchase a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus through T-Mobile’s JUMP! On Demand equipment installment plan. “Yes, it’s that simple. We are not screwing around.”
* As for the new iPhone 6s program, T-Mobile says it’s going to offer the handset for an “unprecedented” $20 a month for 18 months via JUMP! For those wanting the larger iPhone 6s Plus, you can get one for as little as $24 a month. Both will require no money down.
* Of course there are some caveats here, like the need for qualifying credit, but overall it seems like a solid deal. If at any point you want a new phone, you can trade in your working 6s for a brand new device. Or you can keep the phone for 18 months and it’s yours.
* After your 18 monthly payments, you can hand back your phone and pay nothing more.  Or you can pay just $164 more if you want to keep your iPhone 6s.  That means your total cost to own your phone is just $524 – that’s a screaming deal.  It’s special introductory pricing for our launch, and it won’t last long.
* The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be available for pre-order starting Saturday, September 12.
