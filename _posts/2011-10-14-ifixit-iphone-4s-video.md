* If you’re one of the millions of people that pre-ordered an iPhone 4S, or were able to snag one from a retail store, chances are you’ve been busy today. You’ve moved your contacts over, synced it with iTunes, and customized its settings to your liking.
* Well the folks over at iFixYouri have a different ritual they go through after receiving a new handset. They’ve pulled out the mini-screwdriver, and have completely disassembled Apple’s new smartphone. Find out how easy it is in this surprisingly short video clip…
* When I look at the iPhone, particularly the recent two models, I see a thing of beauty. It looks expensive, complicated, and the last thing I would ever do is try and take it apart. But these guys make it look so unbelievably easy, I think I could if I ever needed to.
* I always imagined it would be a lot tougher to dismember a smartphone. I never even dreamed of trying it myself. But you better believe I’m bookmarking this clip in case I ever need to replace a battery or a back plate. I think I could do it.
* Do you do your own repair work on your iPhone?
