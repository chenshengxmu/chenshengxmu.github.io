* Earlier today we brought you details on ih8sn0w’s 2.9.2 release of Sn0wBreeze for Windows.
* Now we’ve put together a written tutorial along with a video tutorial that guides you through the entire tethered jailbreak process for iOS 5.1 on Windows.
* This is a tethered jailbreak for non-A5 devices only, so it won’t work with the iPhone 4S, and iPad 2. If you have an eligible device like the iPhone 4, or iPad 1, then step right inside…
* Step 1: Place your device into DFU mode.
* Step 2: Download Sn0wBreeze 2.9.2 from our downloads page, and execute in Windows XP compatibility mode as an administrator.
* Step 3: Click ok, next, and then click browse and select the iOS 5.1 firmware for your device. Ensure that Sn0wbreeze is able to verify the device, and then click next.
* Step 4: Click Simple Mode from your list of options, and Sn0wBreeze will build a custom firmware file and place it on your desktop when completed.
* Step 5: Once the firmware is built, click ok, and the place your device back into DFU mode and click start. This will place your device into PwnedDFU mode.
* Step 6: Close Sn0wBreeze, open iTunes, and then hold the Shift key on your keyboard and click restore. Select the custom Sn0wBreeze firmware from your desktop, and let iTunes restore your device.
* Step 7: Once restored, setup your device, and you should see the Cydia icon on page 2 of your Home screen. Place you device back into DFU mode.
* Step 8: Locate the iBooty folder on your desktop that Sn0wBreeze creates, and execute iBooty. Select your device from the drop down menu in the bottom right-hand corner, and click start. This will perform a tethered boot so that you can use your device. Every time you reboot your device, you will need to put your device into DFU mode and perform a tethered boot using iBooty.
* Step 9: Once your device is back at your Home screen, you can setup Cydia and start using your newly jailbroken device.
