title: RedSn0w Untethered Jailbreak Updated [Fixes Native Apps Crashes]

* Earlier today, the Dev Team released the beta version of their RedSn0w untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 (see our tutorial here). Like we reported, this untethered jailbreak comes with its fair share of issues, one of the most annoying being that some of the native apps would just crash.
* While there are still a bunch of bugs to be worked out, the Dev Team updated RedSn0w to version 0.9.7b2, which fixes this issue where native apps like the app switcher or the iPod app would crash…
* The second beta is now available (testers ONLY please!).  This version should fix all the native app crashes (including Task switcher).  That’s the only change in from beta1….Bluetooth is still disabled. If you had trouble using the usbmuxd in beta1, please wait until we incorporate that into redsn0w itself (i.e. don’t bother trying this beta2, just wait for the integration).
* The Dev Team said it, we said it, and we’ll probably say again until this RedSn0w comes out of beta: stay away from it if you don’t feel comfortable with all the necessary steps.
* If you feel a little adventurous and still wants to give this untethered jailbreak a try, you may download RedSn0w 0.9.7b2 from our iPhone downloads section, and use our detailed guide.
* As usual, make sure to leave some feedback in the comments section.
