* I’m not sure about you but this week wasn’t as exciting to me in terms of jailbreak tweak releases as it was the last few weeks. But maybe it’s just me, because looking at the numbers, there are no less than 18 new tweaks, some of them more “full-featured” than others.
* Maybe the most interesting thing about this week was the preview we got of CarPlay Activator, an upcoming jailbreak tweak that brings CarPlay directly to your iPhone screen.
* But I’m digressing. This column is mostly about new and updated tweaks, and we have 22 of them in this post today.
