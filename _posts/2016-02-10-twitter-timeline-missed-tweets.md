* The pressure mounts on Twitter to re-ignite growth, which has virtually come to a halt as average users increasingly find the service too confusing and difficult to use. Today, the micro-blogging service unveiled yet another refinement designed to adjust how the timeline surfaces interesting content.
* Similar to the “While you were away” timeline feature which released a year ago, Twitter will now put recommended, not the newest, tweets at the top of your timeline so that you never miss important updates from people you follow.
* After enabling the new ‘Show me the best tweets first’ feature in your timeline settings, the tweets you’re most likely to care about will appear at the top of your timeline, still sorted in reverse chronological order.
* The rest of your tweets will be displayed right underneath, also in reverse chronological order. And when you pull-to-refresh, the app will display all new tweets at the top.
* Twitter determines the best tweets you may have missed based on your usage and what the algorithm thinks you care about, including topics you’re into, the tweets you interact with and the activity of people who are similar to you.
* According to Twitter product manager Michelle Haq in TechCrunch, if a user is more interested in following sports-related accounts, they’re more likely to see tweets that are centered around those sports, like football.
* This is a staggered rollout so not everyone will get the new feature at the same time. Twitter hopes to bring ‘Show me the best Tweets first’ to everyone in the coming weeks.
* A notification will pop up in your timeline in the mobile Twitter app to let you know that you can start using this new feature.
