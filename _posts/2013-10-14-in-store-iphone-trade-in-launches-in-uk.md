* The rumors were true: Apple launching its iPhone trade-in program in the United States in late-August, the company on Monday officially announced that customers visiting its retail stores across the United Kingdom can bring in their previous-generation iPhone for reuse or recycling and receive a credit that can be used toward the purchase of a new iPhone. More details right after the fold…
* Although Apple has been offering the iPhone trade-in program in the United Kingdom for some time through its online store, this is the first time the company has provided the service in-store as well.
* An Apple representative confirmed to Pocket-Lint:
* iPhones hold great value. So, Apple Retail Stores in the UK are launching a new program to assist customers who wish to bring in their previous-generation iPhone for reuse or recycling.
* In addition to helping support the environment, customers will be able to receive a credit for their returned phone that they can use toward the purchase of a new iPhone.
* The credit must be immediately used toward the purchase of a new iPhone.
* The iPhone trade-in is available from the online UK Apple Store.
* Just select the device brand and model and answer a few questions to get a quote. Liquid-damaged devices and handsets with smashed screens won’t yield a resale value.

* Apple notes that The Reuse and Recycling Programme in the United Kingdom is operated exclusively by Dataserv GmbH in its sole responsibility. “Apple Sales International is not liable for and does not warrant for any service provided under this Programme,” reads the fine print.
* As noted by MacRumors, shoppers can also get quotes from Apple for a similar trade-in program online that launched nearly two years ago, with the option of shipping a device for recycling available as well.
* In the United States, the online and in-store programs are run by different third-party companies, and the same may be true in the UK, meaning that consumers may want to check both programs to determine any differences in trade-in value.
* A company called BrightStar handles U.S. iPhone trade-ins on Apple’s behalf.
* You’d be wise to check out offers by separate trade-in services such as Gazelle and other companies because they typically offer almost twice as much trade-in value.
* Although some publications incorrectly reported that the program had launched in Germany, in reality only the Reuse & Recycle program has been available in the country, not the iPhone trade-in.
* The unlocked 16GB iPhone 5s is priced at £549 in the United Kingdom, or about $875. The high-end 64GB model is a £709 value, or about $1130. Of course, customers can get lower prices if they sign on a dotted line and choose either a subsidized handset or an even more affordable SIM-only contract along with non-subsidized hardware.

* If you live in the UK and are considering upgrading to an iPhone 5S, now may be a good time to check the handset’s availability at the UK online Apple Store, O2 and Three via a dedicated web app over at www.stocks5s.com (another iPhone 5s stock-checking web app is available here).
* By the way, the online Apple Store was recently updated with a new shipping estimate of 2-3 weeks for online iPhone 5s orders.
* According to one estimate, the iPhone 5s is outselling the “new” iPhone 5c two-to-one as early adopters rush out to upgrade to Apple’s flagship handset. The company sold nine million new iPhones during the opening weekend and confirmed the handsets will make a landfall in an additional 50+ international markets come November 1.
