* Monday, Apple seeded a third developer-only beta of macOS Sierra (build number “16A254g”) to members of the Apple Developer Program, followed by a version suited for public beta testers 24 hours later.
* After spending some quality time with Sierra’s third beta, our own Andrew O’Hara summed up for you guys all the changes and fixes he’s discovered in Sierra’s beta 3 in a hands-on video.
* Before we get to it, let me point you to our video walkthroughs of the changes, fixes and new features found in iOS 10 beta 3, watchOS 3 beta 3 and tvOS 10 beta 3.
* In this hands-on video, Andrew goes through some of the more newsworthy fixes and changes in Sierra’s third beta. The video, embedded right below, runs four minutes and 28 seconds long.
* Don’t see the video? Watch it on YouTube and please subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube on your way out for more videos from the iDB team, and thanks for watching!
* The following has been changed, fixed and improved in Sierra beta 3:
* For additional notes and known issues in the third beta, see Apple’s release notes.
* We already received complaints from some beta testers that the third beta lacks the “Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac” checkbox in Security and Privacy preferences. This happens after an erase install—Apple acknowledges that “it can take minutes” for the checkbox to show up due to first-time iCloud pairing between devices.

* This is normal, and does not happen on upgrade installs.
* Additionally, FaceTime calling between Sierra beta 3 and prior iOS and macOS betas is unsupported, iTunes 12.5 doesn’t display artwork for rented movies, SMB is now the default file-sharing protocol (not AFP), Live Photos refuse to play back in Photos, AirDrop is unreliable, file search queries are not supported for some languages and so forth.
* See, they call it a beta for a very good reason…
* The first public beta of Sierra was released earlier this month, giving folks who enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program a chance to play with some of the major new features. To clear up any confusion, let me state for the record that the second public Sierra beta and the third developer-only beta offer the same features.
* Some of the more interesting changes in developer-only beta 3 (and public beta 2) include a new default keystroke for Siri, the ability to unlock a Mac awoken from sleep by wearing an Apple Watch, iTunes 12.5 and other tidbits highlighted in the video below.
* Check out our write-up for detailed overview of the changes discussed in the above clip.
* Of course, we must not forget to mention other headlining features in Sierra:
* One of the awesome new Continuity features is Universal Clipboard—which works like magic, really—and the ability to have the contents of your desktop and the Documents folder synced via iCloud and available across iOS devices via the iCloud Drive app.
* Plus, Apple Watch owners are going to be absolutely thrilled by Auto Unlock.
* For more goodies, see our in-depth Sierra previews:
* Sierra has a lot to offer so many people should fall in love with it.
* Our macOS Sierra Preview series will soon highlight additional features.
* macOS Sierra was initially made available as a developer-only preview to members of the Apple Developer Program in June before releasing for public beta-testing in July.
* The operating system will release for public consumption this fall as a free software update via the Mac App Store. macOS Sierra has been confirmed to support a smaller number of Macs.
* Compatible Mac models for Sierra include late-2009 and later MacBooks and iMacs and 2010-and-later MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, Mac minis and Mac Pros. Macs manufactured before 2009 won’t be supported.
* If you’ve happened to discover fixes, tweaks and improvements in Sierra’s beta 3 not mentioned in Andrew’s video or discussed in this article, please post them in comments or ping us at tips@iDownloadBlog.com and we’ll update the article.
