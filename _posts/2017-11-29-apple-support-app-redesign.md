* Apple on Wednesday released an updated version of its dedicated Support app for iPhone and iPad, which launched last December, implementing a redesigned appearance and a few new features like a brand new Discover section and topic search.
* The app now features three tabs alongside the bottom: Discover, Get Support and Account.
* The Discover section automatically presents you with a bunch of useful links, support articles and information about the products you own that are signed in to iCloud with your Apple ID.
* Rotating banners at the top of this section include themed collections of support articles, like “Welcome to iOS 11,” “Take and Manage Photos,” “Get to know your iPhone,” “Get the most from your iPad Pro,” “Apple Watch Workout” and so forth.
* The search field at the top of the Get Support tab lets you quickly search the library of support articles found on Apple’s website. The search feature includes recommendations for popular issues and lets you further narrow down your search results by product type.
* The Get Repair tab is the easiest way to start troubleshooting your devices: just pick one of your registered Apple products or services from the list, then choose appropriate topics and sub-topics for your list of relevant help options.
* The Apple Support app is a free download from App Store.
