* As noted by TheNextWeb, a new iPhone 4S commercial has surfaced starring the popular actor Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. The ad popped up this afternoon during an episode of ESPN’s SportsCenter.
* What’s interesting here is that although the commercial seems to fall in line with previous Apple 4S ads — focus on Siri, production value — it appears that Verizon is behind the spot. Check it out…
* You might have to turn the volume up as the video quality is pretty low. We’ll update this post with the official ad once it gets uploaded.
* What do you think of seeing Mr. Jackson in an iPhone commercial?
