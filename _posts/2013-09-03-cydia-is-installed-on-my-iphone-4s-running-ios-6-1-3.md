* Developer @winocm has been pretty vocal as of late about his intentions to eventually release a jailbreak for iOS 6.1.3 and iOS 6.1.4 devices. Although we generally take such claims with a heaping helping on my favorite seasoning, winocm is, from what I’ve been able to gather, a respectable member of the jailbreak community.
* After all, this is the same developer that worked on an iOS 6.x downgrade, the jailbreak tweak Accentify, and has had various other contributions to the community. Needless to say, when he announced that he had an untether binary that still needed a bit of work, my ears perked up.
* A few days ago, winocm reached out to iDB about his progress on the jailbreak. Although the project is still knee deep in its development phase, he did allow us to go hands on with some of his work. Today, with the help of winocm, I was able to install Cydia on my iPhone 4S running 6.1.3. If we’re ever going to see a proper tool released for the iOS 6.1.3 jailbreak, he just could be the developer to do so.
* Yes, we have video of Cydia running on my iPhone 4S, and yes it’s legit. Although he has asked us not to speak about the process involved in getting a working Cydia on my 4S, I was there and watched him perform the process from start to finish. In other words, I can vouch for the Cydia install, and I can certainly vouch for video’s legitimacy. Have a look…
* With that being said, the verdict is still out as to whether this will result in an actual release that everyone can take advantage of. Although winocm seems bent on accomplishing just that, releasing a working jailbreak to the masses isn’t exactly a cakewalk.
* That considered, although I sat and watch as my normal boring iPhone 4S was transformed into one capable of running themes, tweaks, and jailbreak apps, I have to be honest and say that I’m still a bit skeptical about whether or not this thing will ever see the light of day.
* It’s a good start, but that’s coming from a lay person whose intelligence when it comes to this stuff reaches a plateau fairly early in the game. Winocm is a ridiculously smart individual, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he did eventually release something to the public. I just wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t, either.
* With iOS 7 on the horizon, I’ve heard a lot of folks talk about the usefulness, or lack thereof, of a iOS 6.x jailbreak this late in the game. I still think an iOS 6.1.3 jailbreak would be mighty useful, and tons of people would be happy to have a jailbreak for their 6.1.3 devices. What about you? Would you be happy to have it?
* We’ll be sure to discuss all of this on our upcoming episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak. The episode may be a little bit behind because of circumstances beyond our control, but it’s coming nonetheless.
* Sound off in the comment section below, and be sure to follow @winocm on Twitter and share your thoughts with him.
