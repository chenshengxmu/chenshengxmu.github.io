* The United States’ 3rd largest wireless carrier held their quarterly earnings call yesterday, and the company posted a net loss of $847 million. In wake of the poor performance, Sprint’s stock dropped nearly 16% by the time the market closed last night.
* Although they added a cool million customers last quarter, the company lost 101,000 contacts. What could be causing such a massive leak? Sprint cited Apple’s popular smartphone, especially the $49 iPhone 3GS, as a major factor for the customer deflections…
* As The Wall Street Journal reports, Sprint without an iPhone is struggling to keep relevance in light of larger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Both companies reportedly sold 2+ million iPhones last quarter, a majority of which were subsidized for long term contracts.
* So how will Sprint turn things around next quarter? The carrier is reportedly slated to get a version of Apple’s juggernaut device this Fall. Apple’s next smartphone is expected to be a world-capable device, supporting both GSM and CDMA technologies.
* Hopefully, for Sprint’s sake, the iPhone rumors are true. With an impending AT&T/T-Mobile merger, the carrier stands to be the only major wireless provider in the U.S. to not offer the hottest phone on the planet.
* It would certainly make things interesting if Sprint landed the device, as the carrier offers some of the lowest-priced wireless plans in the business. Not to mention they still offer unlimited data— an option that has gone extinct with most of the competition.
* Would you switch to Sprint if they started carrying the iPhone?
