* Following the antenna issue fiasco, Apple issued an official statement in which it said it would release an update to iOS 4 “within a few weeks”. What does a few weeks mean? 2? 3? 10? No one knows for sure.
* We can still try to figure out when this update might come out by looking at the past updates of iPhone OS 1, 2, and 3. That’s what tiPb did and here is what they found out:
* Neither iOS 1.0 nor 2.0 nor 3.0 were bug-free and while it’s easy to forget, users were clamoring for fixes almost as much in years past as they are now. That said, iOS (iPhone) 3.0.1 was released July 31, 2009. 2.0.1 was August 4, 2008. 1.0.1 was was July 31, 2007.
* Looking at this past update pattern, one might assume that iOS 54 will get an update in the next 3-4 weeks, however, Apple might be delaying this update in order to work on patching the holes of the exploit found by the Dev Team and Comex. That’s what I, and many others think anyways. Time only will tell.
* When do you think iOS 4 will be updated?
