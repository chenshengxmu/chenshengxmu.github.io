* You might have noticed after jailbreaking iOS 10 with Yalu that the Apple logo-based respring screen doesn’t show up anymore, and it would seem that some jailbreak users are beginning to miss seeing it.
* Coming to the rescue at just right time is a new free jailbreak tweak called MakeRespringsGreatAgain by wizages, which brings back the iconic Apple logo screen whenever you respring your device.
* After you install the tweak, your iOS 10 resprings will immediately feel just like they did all jailbreaks prior, and give you something more than just a spinning activity circle to look at.
* You’re going to see it with any and all device resprings, whether you’re doing so from Cydia after installing a new jailbreak tweak, or respringing via a shortcut from one of your already-installed tweaks.
* For those who feel a little nostalgic, MakeRespringsGreatAgain is a gem for jailbroken iOS 10 devices that can downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* There are no options to configure to get the tweak to work, and moreover, it doesn’t need to be installed on devices jailbroken on any other firmware.
* Anyone into coding or interested in learning more about how the tweak works can head over to the developer’s GitHub page where he has open-sourced the tweak so you can learn what makes it tick.
* Will you be bringing back the Apple logo-based respring screen on your jailbroken iOS 10 device? Share your thoughts in the comments below!
