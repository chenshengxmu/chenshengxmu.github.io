* iOS 4.2.1 has been released for a while now, and up until this weekend, there wasn’t a good and practical jailbreak for it. Sure RedSn0w did the trick but since it was a tethered jailbreak, it wasn’t very convenient.
* Then came RedSn0w untethered jailbreak, which was better than its predecessor, but still wasn’t satisfying to most of us. Finally the Chronic Dev Team updated GreenPois0n, which brings a safe and reliable untethered jailbreak for iPhone iOS 4.2.1…
* Should there be a new method to jailbreak iPhone 4.2.1, we will post it here and in our jailbreak section, but for the time being, GreenPois0n is your best bet.
