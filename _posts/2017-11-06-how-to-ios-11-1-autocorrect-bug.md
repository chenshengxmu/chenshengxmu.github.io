* A new Apple support document published two days ago recommends a temporary workaround solution for a weird auto-correct bug in iOS 11.1 where typing the letter “i” can replace it with the uppercase letter “A” and a question mark symbol.
* UPDATE: the iOS 11.1.1 software update, released on November 9, has fixed the bug.
* If you’ve updated to iOS 11.1 and find that when you type the letter “i” it autocorrects to the letter “A” with a question mark, simply create a new Text Replacement for the letter “i”:
* 1) Go to Settings → General → Keyboard → Text Replacement.
* 2) Tap the “+” sign to create a new text replacement.
* 3) For Phrase, type an upper-case “I”. For Shortcut, type a lower-case “i.”
* 4) Tap Save to finish making changes.
* Apple will fix this bug in a future software update though no timeframe for the fix is offered.
* The issue was first noted last week by Reddit user “The Cravin”.
