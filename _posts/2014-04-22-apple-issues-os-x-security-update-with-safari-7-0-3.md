* After pushing iOS 7.1.1 with additional Touch ID improvements and a pair of bug fixes for the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Apple TV devices, Apple has now released a minor software update containing security fixes for OS X systems and the Mac’s Safari browser.
* Officially titled ‘Security Update 2014-002 1.0’, the download comes in at eighty megabytes and includes patches for Safari vulnerabilities and bug fixes for the rest of OS X.
* Apple wholeheartedly recommends this OS X update for all OS X Mavericks users because it improves compatibility, stability and security of your computer. A reboot is required after applying the software…
* Now available under the Updates tab in the Mac App Store, Security Update 2014-002 1.0 contains tons of bug fixes and improvements.
* It also includes Safari 7.0.3 with the following fixes and new features:
* Keep in mind that Apple actually released Safari 7.0.3 with all of the aforementioned improvements on April Fool’s Day, as a standalone update for OS X Mavericks systems.
* There are some fine new Safari features in there, namely the ability to mute those pestering notifications from websites, as pictured below.

* Let me just remind you that Apple back in February delivered a substantial update, OS X 10.9.2, which has squashed the nasty SSL bug, enabled FaceTime Audio on Macs and brought out other useful refinements.
* To apply today’s update, choose Software Update… in your Mac’s Apple menu.
* It’s a good practice to perform a manual Time Machine backup prior to applying OS X software updates, just to be on the safe side in case something goes wrong.
