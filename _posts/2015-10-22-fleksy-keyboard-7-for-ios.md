* Fleksy Keyboard, one of the most popular software keyboards in the App Store, has received a major update this morning. The update to the freemium app strives to solve the problem of users constantly demanding that developers add an ever-growing collection of new UI themes to the app, so they’ve added a new custom theme photo builder feature to Fleksy Keyboard 7.0.
* The ability to personalize the keyboard has been one of the top requests from users, Fleksy says, and has prompted the company to come up with a system for users to build exactly the keyboard that suits their liking, and even share their creations with friends and other Fleksy users.
* Designing your own keyboard theme starts with choosing a background image from your library, or solid color for the background if you prefer clean keyboard looks. You can then further customize it with a variety of different effects, apply different colors to the keys, choose colors for features like suggested and auto-corrected words and much more.

* In addition to using your own keyboard themes on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, you can share them easily with other Fleksy users who can install your theme with a single tap. And if the recipient doesn’t have Fleksy, they will be prompted to download the app for free and then the theme will appear on their device.
* In addition to the new custom theme builder, Fleksy has gained a new toggled in Advanced Settings → Longpress for Numbers which you can enable for quick access to numbers and symbols by long-tapping the keys. There’s also a new setting to enable auto-correct with punctuation, too.
* In other changes, Fleksy now supports more than 150+ new emoji characters provided by the iOS 9.1 software update and includes “several optimizations” for iOS 9.
* The new Fleksy Keyboard features the following:
* Fleksy Keyboard requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later and is provided on a freemium basis with paid themes and additional extension slots sold through the In-App Purchase mechanism. The app is localized in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
* Grab Fleksy Keyboard at no charge in the App Store.
