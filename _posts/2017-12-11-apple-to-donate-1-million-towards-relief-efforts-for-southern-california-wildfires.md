* Apple on Monday said it will make a corporate donation of $1 million towards relief efforts for the Southern California wildfires.
* KTLA 5 Morning News reporter Rich DeMuro tweeted Apple’s message confirming the move.
* “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the fires in Southern California, including our colleagues, friends and their families,” reads Apple’s message. “Apple is donating $1 million to aid in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the communities that have been impacted.”
* This is in addition to the $1 million that the Cupertino company donated for the Northern California fires back in October (it also promised to match employee donations two-to-one).
