* Apple on Wednesday seeded fifth betas of iOS 10.3.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6 to its registered developers and members of the company’s Apple Developer Program. The latest betas arrived following iOS 10.3.3 beta 4 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6 beta 4, which were seeded to developers on June 22, 2017.
* iOS 10.3.3 beta 5 (build number 14G5057a) is available over-the-air via the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app on a supported iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with an appropriate configuration profile installed. macOS Sierra 10.12.6 beta 5 (build number 16G23a) appears underneath the Mac App Store’s Updates tab.
* The configuration profiles needed to enroll your devices into a developer-only beta program can be downloaded through Apple’s portal for developers.
* Some of the fixes in iOS 10.3.3 are mentioned in Andrew’s walkthrough video of the first beta.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube.
* iOS 10.3.3 is a bug-fix release that improves the security and performance of your iPhone, iPad and iPod, just like the upcoming maOS Sierra 10.12.6 update does for your Mac.
* They’re most likely going to be the last point updates to iOS and maOS Sierra as Apple sharpens focus on iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra ahead of their respective launches this fall.
