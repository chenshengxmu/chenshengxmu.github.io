* 9to5Mac is reporting via MacerKopf.de that Apple might plan to unveil iOS 5 on April 14 or 15. This would match announcements of previous iOS versions. For example, iOS 4 was announced on April 8, 2010.
* Like I wrote in my 10 predictions for the iPhone in 2011, I have big expectations for iOS 5. I believe 2011 will be the year of the iOS and that Apple will definitely surprise us. Apple Maps, Wireless Syncing, better notification system are just a few of the expected features…
* As usual, this is just a rumor for the time being but it does look legit. I guess we’ll find out for sure next month.
* What are some of the features you’d want to see in iOS 5?
