* Tempo Smart Calendar by Tempo AI, Inc. is one of the best calendar apps for the iPhone. Best of all, Tempo is totally free (unlike some other premium calendar apps on the iOS platform). Today, the app got bumped to version 1.3, offering a new conference calling feature with up to five participants, free of charge and without ever leaving your calendar.
* There’s also a new custom alert sound and an option to add the current date to the Home screen app icon. The update is now live in the App Store…
* The free conference calling feature is realized in partnership with Speek.com.
* Upon getting your conference call number and passcode, you can create a meeting and automatically add a free conference call for up to five participants.
* As evidenced by the screenshots top of post, you don’t even need to dial a PIN as the app automatically figures out which meetings on your calendar are conference calls and enables one-touch dial as either a host or guest, developers explain.
* To turn on the date badge on the app’s icon, Go to Tempo Settings > Preferences.
* Tempo works with your Google, Exchange and iCloud calendar accounts. The team is promising lots of good stuff coming soon and we’ll make sure to keep you up to date.
* Download Tempo Smart Calendar free in the App Store.
* The app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* There’s no native interface on the iPad, unfortunately.
