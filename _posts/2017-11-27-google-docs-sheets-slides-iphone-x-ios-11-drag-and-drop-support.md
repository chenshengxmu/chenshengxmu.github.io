* Google today updated its mobile Docs, Sheets and Slides apps in App Store with full support for iOS 11, the new iPhone X screen resolution and drag and drop on compatible iPads.
* Now that Docs, Sheets and Slides have embraced the notch, iPhone X owners can enjoy these productivity apps without ugly black bars at the top and bottom of the display as they now take full advantage of the OLED display with edge-to-edge design.
* If you own an iPad that runs iOS 11 or later, you can now also drag content from other apps into Docs, Sheets and Slides. Lastly, all three apps received unspecified bug fixes.
* The search giant recently removed the option to protect access to the Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides apps with a passcode, Touch ID or Face ID. The passcode lock option remains present in the apps, but now users are greeted with a message, saying that “Passcode lock is no longer available in Google Drive, Docs, Sheets or Slides.”
* Google’s popular YouTube app was updated today to address a battery issue on iPhone X.
* Docs, Sheets and Slides are available free from App Store.
