* Those of you who have been having trouble jailbreaking your iPhone 4S or iPad 2 with the Absinthe app will be happy to hear that the Chronic Dev Team has just released an update for the Mac version of the utility.
* The update, which brings Absinthe to version 0.2, is in response to a couple of reported issues with the app, including devices not rebooting after activating its VPN setting, and mysterious white icons…
* Planetbeing, one of Absinthe’s developers, announced the update via his Twitter account:
* “…Mac version updated. v0.2: Tries to fix no reboot after activating VPN/tapping Absinthe icon. We also tried to fix white icons on SpringBoard after jb.”
* He goes onto say that if you still see the white icons, even after using the new version of Absinthe, try installing an application from Cydia. He also notes that if Absinthe crashes, just restart your device and try it again.
* Needless to say, if you’ve already successfully jailbroken your device, there’s no need to do it over again. But for those that have been experiencing problems, you can grab the latest version of Absinthe from our Downloads page.
* Any questions?
