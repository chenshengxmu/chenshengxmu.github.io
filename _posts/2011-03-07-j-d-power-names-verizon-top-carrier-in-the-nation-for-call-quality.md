* Love ’em or hate ’em, if there’s one thing Verizon has going for them, it’s coverage. The network that brags that it is the “nation’s largest and most reliable”, once again proves it has the test scores to back it up. J.D. Power has just released its latest study on customer satisfaction among the nation’s top 4 carriers, and the results shouldn’t surprise you.
* The study addressed such things as frequency of dropped calls, voice distortion, static, and delays in messaging. In testing done between July and December of last year, Verizon had the best or tied for the best satisfaction ratings in five of the six studied areas. AT&T and Sprint went back and forth in the second place spot , while T-Mobile received the worst scores out of the four…
* US Cellular gets an honorable mention, for scoring the highest in the North Central region, beating out the larger wireless companies. J.D. Power’s over all report for all the carriers is pretty gruesome. Well, when you think about how popular smart phones, data cards, and tablets have become, something has to give. AT&T has already seen the negative effects of extra smart phone traffic, due to their nearly four year exclusivity.
* But it appears that if you are a Verizon Wireless customer, your voice quality sucks just a little bit less than the competition. It could be simple math, more customers equals more revenue to spend on your network. Or maybe it’s because they spent a lot of time and money on their network preparing for the big iPhone launch and now let’s just say…… there’s probably bandwidth leftover.
* I’m very curious here, did anyone switch from the AT&T iPhone to the Verizon model and noticed a big difference in call quality? Does anyone on AT&T notice a difference with slightly fewer iPhones fighting for airwaves?
