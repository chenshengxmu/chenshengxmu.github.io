* Many customers have both an iPhone and an iPad 3G that they use on the same network. This requires users to pay for separate data plans, but according to a leaked training manual this could soon change on the nation’s largest carrier, Verizon.
* According to Engadget, who leaked the flier, users will only have to pay a single $9.99 a month fee for one load of data that can be shared between both the iPhone and iPad. In May of 2011, Verizon’s CFO Fran Shammo hinted towards this rolling out, but offered no time frame…
* I think it’s safe to assume that at some point you are going to have mega-plans (for data) and people are going to share that mega-plan based on the number of devices within their family. That’s just a logical progression.
* Besides sharing data between iPhone and iPad, this could also be used as a family plan where data could be shared within the family. No launch date has been given, but sometime this Spring sounds about right.

* AT&T, the carrier with the largest amount of iOS device users, has also been rumored to take similar steps. As the iPad 3 launch nears sometime this Spring, this type of plan makes sense for both carriers.
* Would you purchase a shared data plan?
