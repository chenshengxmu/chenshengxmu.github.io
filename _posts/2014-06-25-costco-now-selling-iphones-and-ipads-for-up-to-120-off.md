* After a four-year hiatus, Costco has began selling select iPhone and iPad models at steep discounts of up to 70% off. The big box retailer had stopped selling Apple products in 2010 following a dispute in which it was not allowed to carry the iPad, but it appears that the two companies have now reconciled their business relationship.
* Costco now offers a limited selection of iPhones on AT&T, Sprint and Verizon through its online store, including the 16 GB iPhone 5s in space grey, silver or gold for just $77.99. The smartphone regularly retails for $199.99 with a new two-year contract, making this one of the better deals for an iPhone 5s you will find. The devices are not available in stores…

* The wholesale retailer is also selling the iPad Air and iPad mini on Verizon for $519.99 and $419.99 respectively, which is a savings of $100 off each tablet. The online inventory lists T-Mobile models of the iPad Air and iPad mini as being available today through select Costco Wireless Kiosks. There is a $25 Costco Cash Card available via mail-in rebate for financed devices.
* It was originally reported a few weeks ago that Apple and Costco had reached a new agreement to sell iPhones and iPads. While only cellular models of iPhones and iPads have been made available so far, Wi-Fi only models of the iPad and certain iPod models have showed up in Costco’s inventory system earlier this month. The company also sells iTunes gift cards.
* Costco is the second-largest retailer behind Walmart, and the largest membership-based wholesale club chain, in the United States. It carries a wide variety of other electronics, including smartphones, televisions, digital cameras, audio and video equipment, surveillance systems and more. This story was originally reported by T-GAAP via 9to5Mac.
