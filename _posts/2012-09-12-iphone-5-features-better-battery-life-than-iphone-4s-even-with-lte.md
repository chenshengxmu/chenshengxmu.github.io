* Some impressive battery life statistics coming out of the iPhone 5 keynote right now. Battery life hasn’t decreased with the addition of LTE, as some might image. In fact, it hasn’t even stayed the same. No, Apple has exceeded the battery life levels present in the non-LTE enabled iPhone 4S.
* With the iPhone 5, there’s 8 hours of browsing or talk on either LTE or 3G, and 10 hours on WiFi browsing.

* Are you surprised that Apple was able to pull this off, even with LTE?
