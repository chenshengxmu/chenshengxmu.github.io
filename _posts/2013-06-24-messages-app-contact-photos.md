* Earlier today, Apple released the second beta of its next-generation mobile operating system, iOS 7, to developers. The update comes exactly two weeks after the original beta of iOS 7 was released, and brings with it a number of new features and improvements.
* Thus far we’ve covered the revamped Voice Memos app and new Siri voices, and now we’re going to talk about the different changes in the stock Messages app. Apple has added contact photos to group conversation threads and a few other UI enhancements…
* Easily the most noticeable change to the Messages app in beta 2 are the presence of contact photos in group conversations. Similar to how jailbreak tweaks like Copic add contact photos to messaging threads, the Messages app now shows images from your contact cards in conversation.
* Here’s Jeff with a hands-on look at the beta 2 changes in Messages:
* Unfortunately, it appears that this is only the case when in group conversations. So you have to be talking with multiple people to see the contact photos. I’d like to see the photos everywhere in Messages, including the main window that shows all of your convos.
* Other changes in the app include what looks like thicker text on the Send button — in beta one, the font was very thin — as well as enhanced ‘send’ animations. And also, there are now timestamps for each message. Simply swipe to the right on a Message to reveal.
