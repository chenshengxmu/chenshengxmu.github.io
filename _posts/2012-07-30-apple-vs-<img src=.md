* A high-stake technology trial involving Apple and Samsung is set to kick off today in a U.S. District court in San Jose, northern California over design and patent infringement claims involving Samsung’s Galaxy lineup of smartphones and tablets and Apple’s iPhone and iPad.
* In the run-up to the mega-trial a bunch of court filings was made public, revealing Samsung’s overly aggressive court strategy but also offering a unique glimpse into Apple’s prototyping and industrial design processes. When all is said and done, this is what the jurors will see…
* Samsung apparently wants 2.4 percent of Apple’s sales for use of its mobile communications technology. Apple on its part reportedly offers the half a cent per-device royalty fee and demands as much as $2.5 billion in damages from Samsung.
* It boils down to who copied whom and turns out both parties have a chart for that.
* Here’s Apple’s.

* And this is what Samsung will show to the jurors.

* By showing ten internal touchscreen phone prototypes that predate the iPhone, Samsung will try to establish that it did not copy Apple’s popular device.
* Samsung claims one of the prototypes, code-named the F700, had been in development before the iPhone’s debut in June 2007. Interestingly enough, Samsung says the F700 was the subject of a Korean design registration application in December of 2006, a month before the iPhone’s public unveiling.
* We’ll see how Apple wiggles out of this one.
* Fortune’s Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who called this “the end of the beginning of Apple’s proxy war against Google”, points to the very first sentence in Apple’s and Samsung’s pretrial briefs.
* Apple writes that “Samsung is on trial because it made a deliberate decision to copy Apple’s iPhone and iPad”.
* Unsurprisingly, Samsung’s pretrial brief reads that “in this lawsuit, Apple seeks to stifle legitimate competition and limit consumer choice to maintain its historically exorbitant profits”.
* Apple filed its suit against Samsung in April of 2011 and the South Korean conglomerate counter-sued shortly thereafter. Apple’s pre-court filing reveals the company will warn the jury that Google and several renowned designers warned Samsung against copying the iPhone’s look and feel.

* Samsung will try to establish enough of a prior art to invalidate Apple’s patents, including assertions that the iPhone maker ripped off Sony’s design style for the iPhone.
* However, Shin Nishibori, the designer Apple hired from Sony to create a Sony-inspired iPhone prototype, no longer works for Apple and Nishibori’s lawyer wrote in a letter to the court yesterday that his client has no plans to testify in the upcoming trial.
* Ina Fried of AllThingsD has a handy cheat sheet for those that love legal matters.
* What do you guys think, will Apple and Samsung settle or wage a thermonuclear war until extinction?
