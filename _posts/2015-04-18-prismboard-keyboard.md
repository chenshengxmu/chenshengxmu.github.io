* PrismBoard is a jailbreak tweak that adds a new look to the stock iOS keyboard. Like the geometric figure it’s named after, it produces all sorts of different colors. Each key press results in a random color on the key pop-up. If you want a way to spice up the look of the keyboard on your jailbroken iPhone, then PrismBoard should be near the top of you list.
* Once PrismBoard is installed it begins working immediately. In fact, there are no preferences to configure, no related app icons on the Home screen, etc.
* PrismBoard is truly the definition of plug and play. If you’d like to give it a go, then head over to the BigBoss repo where it can be downloaded free of charge.
* True, PrismBoard doesn’t offer any new functionality, but jailbreaking isn’t always about adding functionality. Sometimes you just want a tweak that gives your iPhone a unique look, and PrismBoard is quite up to the task.
* What do you think?
