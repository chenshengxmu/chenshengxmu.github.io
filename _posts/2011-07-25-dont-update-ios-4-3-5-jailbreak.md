* With the release of iOS 4.3.5 and 4.3.10 earlier today, I think it would be safe to remind you to stay away from the “update” button if you care about your jailbreak or unlock.
* If you run a stock iPhone or iPad then go ahead and update to the latest firmware. But if, like most iDB readers, you heavily rely on a jailbreak/unlock, make sure you do not update…
* You’d still be able to jailbreak iOS 4.3.5 using RedSn0w, but it would be a tethered jailbreak, meaning you would have to plug your iDevice in your computer to tether boot it every time you have to start it up.
* Updating to the latest firmware would definitely make you lose your software unlock no matter what.
