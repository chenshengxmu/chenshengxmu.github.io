* Looking to add Siri on your iPhone 2G, iPod touch, or virtually any other pre-iPhone 4S device? Then look no further than Sara.
* Sara is far from perfect, but if Siri Proxy is not an option for you then it is likely the next best thing.
* Check inside as we take Sara for a test drive on video…
* There’s no denying that Sara is limited in function when compared to the real thing; for instance, you can’t use location based query commands without Sara returning some sort of nonsense. Alarm clocks don’t work, weather can be inaccurate, and a whole host of other grammar inaccuracies ensure no one will be mistaking Sara for the real thing any time soon.
* But it is free, and it’s a decent addition for owners of older jailbroken devices like the original iPhone or iPod touch.
* Sara even features some advanced options like translation, YouTube search, and more. Of course, you can do all of that with a real jailbroken Siri implementation, but it’s still nice to be able to pull this off on an older device where Siri was never intended to run.
* If you want to try this for yourself, add the following repo to your sources: http://isoftjsc.com and download the package that corresponds with your device. Be aware that the download will likely time out a few times, but keep trying; I think their servers may be getting hammered.
* In the end Sara is another wannabe Siri alternative that doesn’t come very close to the real thing; however, it’s better than nothing if you aren’t up to fooling with Siri Proxy and/or you have an older iOS device.
* What are your thoughts on Sara?
