* Following Apple’s holiday ad featuring Stevie Wonder and Andra Day, rival Microsoft today released its own holiday-themed commercial in which employees of its retail store on New York City’s Fifth Avenue are shown spreading the message of peace outside of Apple’s iconic glass cube store.
* As reported by AdAge, Microsoft flew store employees from around the country to New York City to film this commercial on November 16.
* They were joined by a local NYC children’s youth choir in singing “Let There Be Peace On Earth” to their Apple Store peers.
* And here’s the commercial.

* Kathleen Hall, corporate Vice President of Global Advertising at Microsoft, told AdAge Microsoft had to get permission from Apple to perform the song on the store’s plaza.
* “Apple, she said, knew Microsoft would be filming something, they just weren’t sure what,” AdAge writes.
* “In the spot, Microsoft employees begin singing, while Apple employees spill out of the store to watch. Employees from the two rival companies hug, a move Ms. Hall said was a moment of ‘setting differences aside and coming together,’” reads the article.
* It’s certainly nice seeing old rivals hugging it out and spreading the message of love and peace for the holidays, wouldn’t you agree?
