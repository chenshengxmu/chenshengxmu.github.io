* Sony today confirmed in a blog post that it’s working on a Mac and Windows app with remote play functionality for PlayStation 4 games.
* “We’re bringing PS4 Remote Play to Windows PC and Mac,” said the Japanese gaming giant. “This feature won’t be available to test in the beta, but you can look forward to it soon.”
* Remote play via Mac and Windows will require the forthcoming PlayStation system software update version 3.50, codenamed “Musashi,” which is now available to those who have signed up for the beta and were selected.
* Though you must still own a PlayStation 4 console to take advantage of remote play, the feature will allow you to stream game play to your iMac’s beautiful 27-inch display, or to any other supported Mac model.
* Other new system features in the firmware update include the ability to live stream directly to Dailymotion on the PlayStation 4 with support for archiving live broadcasts, online notifications when members of your friends list sign on the PlayStation network, a new ‘Appear Offline’ status in the Profile or the Quick Menu section, the ability to schedule a future gameplay session and allowing all members of a Party to see what each person is playing.
