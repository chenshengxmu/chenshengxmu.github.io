* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Angry Birds Space. This means that for the next 7 days you can pick up the popular title for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving yourself $4.
* If you’ve ever played an Angry Birds game, this one shouldn’t need much explanation. It’s the same general idea, except with Space you’ll enjoy 300+ interstellar levels, new characters, gravity trick shots, and much more.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Think you’ve seen it all from the Angry Birds franchise? Think again. Our feathered friends are wackier than ever in this sequel that boosts classic pig-blasting action with cosmic physics. Rovio had us at gravitational fields, but between all the brilliant levels, fearsome new fowl, and zany visuals, we’re totally entertained. 
* And here’s a promo video for the game:
* Angry Birds Space is available in the App Store for free.
