* Apple on Monday seeded the second betas of iOS 11.2, watchOS 4.2, tvOS 11.2 and macOS 10.13.2 to developers. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* Looking at the first beta, iOS 11.2 isn’t going to have a ton of user-facing changes. Most of it is under the hood stuff, like a fix for the annoying input lag in the calculator app, a fix for the flickering boot logo bug and support for SiriKit for HomePod. That being said, older iPhone owners will get the new iPhone 8/8 Plus wallpapers in this update, as well as tweaked emoji. Check out our video on all the changes below.

* watchOS 4.2 also seems like a relatively minor update thus far, save for a few small tweaks. There’s a new shortcut button for Bluetooth devices when playing audio and the aforementioned tweaked emoji, and then the usual bouquet of bug fixes and improvements. Check out our hands on video below.
* tvOS 11.2 improves the media experience for owners of the just-released Apple TV 4K by adding the ability to match the native frame rate and dynamic range of your content. This makes games and other GPU-accelerated content look better, and you can find the new option in Settings.
* Sticking with the theme of this round of updates, no new user-facing features or changes have been discovered in macOS 10.13.2 as of yet. For now we’ll chalk this up to another maintenance/performance improvement update, but if we find any changes in the new beta, we’ll be sure to let you know.
