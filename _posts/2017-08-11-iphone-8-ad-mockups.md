* We’re only a few weeks away from Apple’s September event that will serve as a launchpad for Apple’s highly anticipated tenth-anniversary handset. While the rumors have mostly revolved around possible hardware advances for the OLED iPhone model, one aspect has remained largely overlooked thus far: how Apple could market iPhone 8.
* Industrial designer Quinton Theron saw to that with a batch of jaw-dropping renderings depicting possible marketing images for iPhone 8 versions in Black, White, Gold and Rose Gold, complete with a clown fish wallpaper owned by news.scubafish.com.

* By the way, clown fish was the default wallpaper for the original iPhone ten years ago.

* The latest rumors claim that Apple abandoned an in-screen Touch ID which appears on Quinton’s renderings but that doesn’t make his iPhone 8 vision any less stunning.

* Check out the additional renderings embedded below and dare tell me that Apple’s HR department shouldn’t be in contact with this guy promptly regarding immediate employment.

* The more I look at Quinton’s renderings, the more I think Apple should make a ceramic white version of iPhone 8.
* Oh, wait…

* “In this concept, I envision how iPhone 8 would look in Ceramic Edition,” he wrote. “This model is based on current rumors and speculation molded around my own design.”

* He adapted the description from Apple’s Watch Edition webpage slightly to suit a possible iPhone 8 Edition model. The wallpaper used in this model is a cropped version of a photograph by David Doubilet, National Geographic Creative.

* For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that recent rumors have suggested that the OLED iPhone will arrive in just three colors—Black, White and a new hue that’s “closer in copper” in its color and visually similar to Rose Gold devices.
* So, how do you like these renderings?
* If iPhone 8 looks anything resembling this concept, would you consider buying it? And how about that ceramic iPhone 8 Edition model? Would you pay a premium for it?
* Sound off in the comments!
