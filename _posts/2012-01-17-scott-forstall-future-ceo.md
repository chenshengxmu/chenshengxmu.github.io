title: New Book About Apple Reveals Scott Forstall Might Be the Companys Future CEO
---
* Fortune’s editor Adam Lashinsky is about to release a new book about Apple next week titled Inside Apple. In the book, we learn that Scott Forstall, the head of iOS, might be in the best seat to become Apple’s CEO when Tim Cook steps down:
* “He’s a sharp, down-to-earth, and talented engineer, and a more-than-decent presenter,” one entrepreneur told Adam Lashinsky. “He’s the total package.”
* According to Lashinsky’s new book Inside Apple: How America’s Most Admired — and Secretive — Company Really Works, senior vice president Scott Forstall stands out among the rest of Apple’s executive team as the most likely to succeed Steve Jobs once the Tim Cook era is over.
* Theoretically, we’re still years away from a CEO swap as Tim Cook recently got appointed following the passing of Steve Jobs. And word on the street is that he got some big incentives to stay for at least 10 years. Things can change fast in Silicon Valley though.
