* Our Wallpapers of the Week category keeps you fresh with quality wallpapers every Sunday. But, every now and then, we just can’t help but release a mid-week set. These iPhone wallpapers were just too hot to keep until the weekend. iDB fan favorite @AR72014 has optimized the iMac Pro wallpapers for your iPhone and we have three versions ready to download. If you are looking for the 5k iMac blue cloud wallpaper for your desktop, we have that too.
* AR72014 did a great job optimizing these images for your iPhone devices. If there were iPad versions, I would have included them. Therefore, the following images are only optimized for iPhones. But, you will find the full 5k version at the article’s bottom.
* If you have any amazing wallpapers, catch up with me @jim_gresham to share your findings. The Wallpapers of the Week section is made possible by you!
