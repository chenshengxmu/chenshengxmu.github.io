* Newly discovered FCC documents have leaked what may be the first Beats product released under Apple’s banner: Bluetooth-enabled Beats Solo2 headphones. First spotted by 9to5Mac, the new Solo2s look nearly identical to their predecessor, with the exception that they’re wireless.
* The headphones will utilize Bluetooth Low Energy tech, and won’t be Beats’ first cordless can offering. The company has, for a while now, carried the Beats Studio Wireless–although looking at previous line pricing, it’s likely that the new Solo2 product will be a bit more affordable.

* What makes these new headphones really interesting, though, is the Apple-branding denoted in the FCC documents. The Cupertino firm is listed as the creator and tester of the product, and according to the filing, Apple’s familiar fruit-shaped logo will be stamped on the packaging.
* I’m anxious to see if there will be any differences in how Apple-branded Beats products look or sound. The Solo2 wireless headphones are currently under FCC review, with an unknown release date. But with holiday shopping season revving up, we may be seeing them sooner than later.
* Apple completed its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics in August of this year.
