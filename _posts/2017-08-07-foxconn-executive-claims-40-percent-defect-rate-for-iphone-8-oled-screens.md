* OLED screens for iPhone 8 are proving significantly more difficult to mass-manufacture than Apple’s suppliers may have anticipated, with a Foxconn executive claiming high rejection rate for the sophisticated display panels due to “a special cutting” in them.
* According to MyDrivers yesterday, Foxconn Vice President Luo Zhongsheng opined on Chinese social network Weibo that a low yield of the OLED screens is among the chief reasons why iPhone 8 buyers would have to pay a premium for the device.
* “Cutting the display into this special shape looks really difficult, and the cost won’t be cheap,” reads his post. “I estimate that iPhone 8 won’t be cheap.”
* iPhone 8 is widely believed to feature a notch in the middle of the iOS status bar at the top of its seamless OLED display in order to accommodate the front-facing camera and sensors.
* The now-deleted post did not specify if “a special cutting” refers to the notch at the top of the OLED display. In manufacturing, yield is a measure of efficiency.
* It’s defined as the number of units coming out of a process divided by the number of units going into that process over a specified period of time.
* Despite being widely used on high-end Samsung devices, OLED panels are still difficult to produce in volume, resulting in high yields.
* As an example, the yield rate on Samsung-made OLEDs for iPhone 8 is believed to be about 60 percent. By comparison, the production yield rate on Samsung-built OLED panels for its own devices like Galaxy S8 is about 80 percent.
