* Tidal is priced at $9.99 per month for standard sound quality, or $19.99 per month for lossless streaming. Other tiers are available, too, like family and student accounts.
* Both the standard and premium tiers include HD music videos.
* According to a recent report, Tidal has only enough cash to last it six months after losing about $44 million last year. Jay-Z and other Tidal co-owners apparently lost $500+ million in all.
* Spotify, the biggest name in music streaming, is yet to roll out an Apple TV app.
* To download Tidal for Apple TV, search for “Tidal Music” on tvOS App Store or use your Siri Remote to ask Siri to “Download Tidal Music from App Store.”
