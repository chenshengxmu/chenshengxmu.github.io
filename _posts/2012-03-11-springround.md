* Springround is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that will allow you to access your iPhone’s Home screen app icons from anywhere.
* In order to accomplish this feat, the developers of Springround employed the trusty Activator, which allows it to be invoked inside any app.
* Springround is the perfect mix of function and simplicity as you’ll see from our hands-on video inside…
* Besides the Activator action configuration, Springround features on additional setting that allows you to interact with an app in the background while your app icons are on screen. For instance, I was able to browse the web in the background, while also swiping from left to right as I navigated through my installed apps.
* Springround has yet to be released, but expect it to touch down later this week on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99.
* What do you think?
