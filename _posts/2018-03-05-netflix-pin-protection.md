* Netflix on Monday announced a new privacy-oriented feature along with clearer maturity rating labels that should help parents shield their children from inappropriate content on the service.
* The first change, a PIN parental control feature for individual movies and series, lets parents be more specific in terms of what their children can watch on the popular service. “PIN protection for a specific series or film provides families with an additional tool to make decisions they are comfortable with,” said the firm. You simply enter a show or movie name to restrict a specific title.
* Don’t confuse this feature with Netflix’s existing PIN protection for all content at a particular maturity level. Speaking of which, another change will have Netflix begin showing more prominently the maturity level rating for a series or film once a member hits play on a title.
* Maturity level ratings are available elsewhere on the service so this change is focused on making sure Netflix members are fully aware of the maturity level as they begin watching. The company added that it is continuing to explore ways to make maturity level rating labels more descriptive and easier for members to understand “with just a quick glance.”
* The video-streaming company has said that it’s currently rolling out the aforementioned improvements across Netflix devices and markets in the coming months.
