* A new rumor published yesterday by an outlet without a reliable track record in predicting Apple’s product roadmap has made claims that the firm will release its AirPower wireless charging mat and AirPods wireless charging case as soon as next month.
* Citing a tipster from Best Buy, The Apple Post wrote that the big box consumer electronics retailer will kick off sales of both Qi-compliant accessories towards towards the end of March, likely the same time Apple begins retailing the accessories themselves.
* The Cupertino company will be reportedly sending additional units to be used as store demos and displays. Best Buy is an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Most of their retail locations offer a designated area specifically for showcasing Apple products.
* “Our tipster has claimed that Apple’s new charging case for AirPods will launch simultaneously with AirPower in March, however it’s believed Best Buy will only stock the case when sold with brand-new AirPods,” reads the article.
* In other words, this could be hinting that the standalone AirPods wireless charging case will be available through Apple exclusively.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is expecting AirPods shipments to double in 2018 to 26-28 million units. The revered analyst has predicted that an upgraded AirPods outfitted with a “smaller quartz component” will be arriving later this year.
