* The folks over at Halfbrick Studios must be getting in the holiday spirt, because they just discounted their entire library of iOS games down to free. That’s right, for a limited time, you can pick up any one of their popular apps for iPhone and iPad, at absolutely 0 cost.
* Even if you’re not familiar with the Halfbrick name, there’s a good chance you’ve played one of their titles. The studio is responsible for a number of iOS hits including Fruit Ninja, Monster Dash, Jetpack Joyride and more. Full list of games and App Store links below.
* Halfbrick has held a similar sale before, and many of these games have been offered for free at one time or another. But if you’ve yet to pick up any of the above titles, now’s your chance to do so. We’re not sure when the promo ends, but it should last through the holidays.
