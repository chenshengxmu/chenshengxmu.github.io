* Apple hasn’t forgotten about iTunes Remote, a dedicated iPhone and iPad app for remote control of desktop iTunes from anywhere in your home. A new updated that dropped yesterday brings out an all-new look along with a brand new app icon and full support for iOS 12 and the edge-to-edge Super Retina display on iPhone X.
* The 4.4 update finally does not show the ugly horizontal black bars at the top and the bottom of the interface when running on an iPhone X. As a bonus, the app now scales nicely up to iPad Pro sizes. The updated includes unspecified stability and performance improvements, too.
* Aside from controlling desktop iTunes, the app is a software remote for Apple TVs.
* Although remote Apple TV control is now built into iOS’s Control Center, both iTunes Remote and the Apple TV Remote apps continue to support that functionality even though the latter is limited to supporting the fourth-generation Apple TV and the Apple TV 4K model.
* iTunes Remote requires an iOS device with iOS 9 or later and a Wi-Fi connection to iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC. Keep in mind that iTunes 12.7.5 is recommended for user with the refreshed iTunes Remote 4.4 app.
* Grab iTunes Remote for free on App Store.
