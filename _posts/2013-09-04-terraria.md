* Terraria is a pixelated adventure role-playing game that first launched for PC on Steam in 2011. Now, fans of the dig-and-build platformer can play to their hearts content on the iPhone and iPad…
* Players are able to chop wood, dig for precious metals, and find stone blocks to create a comfortable home. Explore a vast, side-scrolling world to gather all of the materials you need to make a castle for your adventurer.
* In addition to building a dream home, players must keep an eye out for enemies, like green slime, werewolves, and zombies. Use your trusty axe to chop your way through bad guys. The game features day and night cycles so you will be faced with different types of enemies depending on whether the sun is up or down.

* If you build a sweet pad, you may find yourself with a roommate. Complete achievements to gain respect from non-player characters (NPCs) that will occupy your establishment and help you fill your inventory sack with awesome equipment.
* Similar to Minecraft, this game lets you combine materials and use specific tools to create new items. The crafting system in Terraria features more than 200 recipes so you can build customized and unique houses for your many NPCs. Plus, there are more than 25 different blocks to uncover, so you can really trick out your basement to keep your treasure locked up in.
* Fight against 75 monsters that change, depending on the time of day. Come face-to-face with five epic bosses that will challenge your platformer gaming skills. Invite 10 different NPCs into your home. Explore more than a dozen different environments.
