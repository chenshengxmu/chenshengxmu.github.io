* Following blurry photos of an alleged Lightning-based edition of the EarPods, Apple’s stock iPhone headphones, a new video now gives us a far better look at what appears to be fully functional headphones resembling the EarPods, except they connect into the iPhone’s Lightning port.
* Published on YouTube channel EverythingApplesPro on Friday and first discovered by French blog iGen.fr, the 60-second clip shows the headphones connected via Lightning to an iPhone running iOS 9. They work as you’d expect, including controlling playback via the in-line Play/Pause and Volume Up and Down buttons.
* As you can see for yourself, volume control seems to be working fine in the YouTube app, as does the Play/Pause button. However, the narrator didn’t test the EarPods’ in-line microphone. The headphones look genuine but there’s no way to accurately assess if what we’re seeing on the video is in fact a legitimate Apple product.
* Here’s your first look at the supposed Lightning EarPods.
* The EarPods apparently leaked from Chinese parts suppliers.
* It’s unclear if Apple will ship Lightning-based EarPods in the iPhone 7 box or their wireless, Bluetooth-powered counterpart. It’s also unknown if the iPhone 7 box will include a rumored Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, just the headphones, both or none.
