* Despite all of the praise it’s received for its Retina display and LTE-compatibility, the new iPad does have its caveats. For instance, it takes considerably longer to charge than both of its predecessors.
* The reason for this is obviously because the new iPad has a bigger battery. But surprisingly, it’s still rather efficient. According to a new study, the tablet only costs $1.36 per year to charge…
* AppleInsider points to a new study from Electric Power Research Institute, a non-profit organization focusing on electricity research and development, regarding Apple’s latest iPad.
* “The third-generation iPad, which sports a high-capacity 42.5-watt-hour battery, uses 11.86 kilowatt hours of electricity over a one year period, a stark contrast to a 42″ plasma television which consumes 258 kWh. An average laptop consumes 72.3 kWh while a 60-watt CFL light bulb eats about 14 kWh, costing an average of $8.31 and $1.61 a year, respectively.”
* The numbers will obviously vary by location and charging habits. This particular study took place in Knoxville, Tennessee, and is based on charging the device every other day for a year.
* Regardless, it’s still interesting to see that, on average, the iPad uses less energy to charge in a year than the average 60-watt light bulb.
