* Thanks to iOS 12, you can select text and position the cursor with great precision simply by turning your virtual keyboard into a software trackpad—even if your iPhone lacks 3D Touch.
* Back in 2015, iOS 9 introduced a cool iPad feature allowing you to slide two fingers across the virtual keyboard in order to move the insertion point or select a chunk of text with precision.
* iPhone 6s has helped elevated the feature to new heights thanks to its 3D Touch hardware.
* And with iOS 12, Apple is bringing this super-handy precise cursor positioning and text selection to its non-3D Touch smartphones and the iPod touch media player. In other words, iOS 12 lets customers reap the benefits of accurate cursor control afforded by dedicated 3D Touch hardware but on devices that lack 3D Touch, like iPhone SE and iPhone 5s.
* Here’s how…
* 1) Open an app you’d like (suggestion: Notes) and bring up iOS’s virtual keyboard.
* 2) With iOS’s software keyboard active, tap and hold the Space bar key.
* Voilà, your iPhone keyboard is now in trackpad mode with all of the keys greyed out.

* No problem, simply disable 3D Touch features in Settings.
* In addition to supporting non-3D Touch iPhones, the best thing about this particular iOS 12 feature is that it works on your rusty old sixth-generation iPod touch as well.
* Please keep in mind that iOS 12 doesn’t replicate the advanced text-selection features that require dedicated pressure-sensing hardware. On devices with 3D Touch, endless to say, iOS 12 continues to support the full range of virtual trackpad features.
* These include pressing the keyboard firmly to enter cursor-positioning mode, pressing a little harder to quickly select a word, sentence or paragraph, deleting large chunks of text faster by pressing the Backspace key with 3D Touch and more.
