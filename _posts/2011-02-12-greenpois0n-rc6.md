* The iPhone 4.2.1 jailbreak tool GreenPois0n has been updated to version RC6. This update brings support for the Apple TV and fixes emulators compatibility issues with GreenPois0n.
* Since it came out last week, GreenPois0n has been updated several times, and can now also be used to jailbreak the Verizon iPhone. Although RedSn0w can also provide an untethered jailbreak, GreenPois0n still remains our recommended jailbreak for 4.2.1…
* You can download GreenPoison RC6 for Mac and Windows from our iPhone downloads section.
* If you’re going to give it a try, please let us know how it went for you.
