* The high-profile ‘Steve Jobs’ biopic, based on Walter Isaacson authorized biography of Apple’s mercurial co-founder, released today in select theaters across the United States and Universal posted a full scene on its YouTube channel to celebrate the launch.
* In it, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (played by Seth Rogen) warns Steve (played by Michael Fassbender) that the launch of NeXT, Jobs’s overpriced, cube-shaped workstation computer created during his wilderness years, will go down in history “as the single biggest failure in the history of personal computing.”
* The key exchange between the two Steves goes something like this:
* Woz: You can’t write code, you’re not an engineer, you’re not a designer, you can’t put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board, the graphical interface was stolen from Xerox Parc, Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team before you threw him off his own project. Everything — someone else designed the box! So how come 10 times in a day, I read “Steve jobs is a genius.” What do you do?
* Jobs: I play the orchestra. And you’re a good musician, you sit right there, you’re the best in your row.
* Check out that scene right below.
* And here’s a look inside video.
* The Rolling Stone gave ‘Steve Jobs’ four stars in its review, but Apple’s leadership is unimpressed with the movie. Steve’s widow, Lauren Powell Jobs, reportedly “tried to kill” the biopic and attempted to cease production on the Aaron Sorkin script multiple times, according to the Wall Street Journal.
* “She refused to discuss anything in Aaron’s script that bothered her despite my repeated entreaties,” producer Scott Rudin said, adding that Ms. Jobs “continued to say how much she disliked the book, and that any movie based on the book could not possibly be accurate.”
* In what could be described as a defensive move, Apple leaked an internal video to ABC News which shows Jobs’s “softer side” as he addresses a gathering of Apple executives the day before the release of the original iPhone in 2007.
* Jony Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer, doesn’t care about the movie. Speaking at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit on Wednesday, here’s how Ive reacted to the movie’s portrayal of Steve.
* “I just find it ever so sad. Jobs had his triumphs and his tragedies, like us all,” Ive said to the crowd. “And like most of us, he’s having his identity described, defined by a whole bunch of other people. I think that’s a bit of a struggle, personally.”
* As for the legendary Woz, the man took to comments in TechCrunch’s article about the movie, writing that the producers actually made up that scene based on the first few months of the Apple II.
* “I always give Jobs the credit for finishing a design into a product and marketing it and much more,” he wrote. “The movie made up this part based on the first few months of the Apple II but I, instead of Jobs, should have been the one to say ‘I’m the best in my row, actually in every row.’ I only wanted recognition as a good (great) engineer.”
* Speaking of marketing, here’s an interesting clip cleaned up by ideaMachine Studio in which Steve lays out to his executives what’s in Apple’s DNA.
* Re/code agrees that Universal’s ‘Steve Jobs’ made a lot of things up.
* Some of these made-up events include “a dramatic reimagining of preparations for the Mac’s demo in which it blows up in rehearsal, instead of declaring, ‘Hello, I am Macintosh’,” explains the publication.
* Moreover, some of the long, stinging exchanges in the movie aren’t drawn at all from any of the six biographies written about Jobs.
* Are you planning on watching this biopic?
* The flick released today across select theaters in New York and Los Angeles and will see a much wider release on October 23.
