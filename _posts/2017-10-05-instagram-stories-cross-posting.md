* After testing it with a small subset of users in Portugal last month, Instagram is now widely rolling out a new feature that lets you cross-post your Instagram Stories to Facebook Stories.
* If this capability has been enabled for you, you’ll be presented with the cross-posting option when sharing a Story in the mobile Instagram app.
* An Instagram spokesperson told TechCrunch:
* You now have the option to share your Instagram Stories to your Facebook Stories. We’re always working to make it easier to share any moment with the people who matter to you.
* While it’s now possible to post Instagram Stories to Facebook, you can’t do the reverse.
* Posting Stories from Facebook to Instagram may be coming at some point in the future because Instagram hasn’t ruled out that possibility.
* If you’ve never bothered to manually syndicate your Stories because life is too short, this new feature should be very handy for keeping your Instagram followers and Facebook friends up to date with what you’re doing.
* Everyone should have this new capability soon, if not already.
* Facebook has also implemented Story-like features in Messenger and WhatsApp, but there was no word at post time whether cross-posting to Messenger’s My Day or WhatsApp media-rich statuses was on the roadmap.
* Do you use Instagram Stories? How about Facebook Stories?
* Let us know in the comments below.
