---
* Fans of the late 1980s hit fighting game series Double Dragon (and awesome Scott Wolf spinoff movie) will be happy to know that the first three titles have just launched on iOS.

* Double Dragon Trilogy is a cooperative fighting game that includes Double Dragon, Double Dragon 2: The Revenge, and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone. Punch, kick, and elbow your way to rescuing the damsel in distress in this port of the classic trilogy…
* All three games in this app come with two game modes; Arcade and Story. In Arcade mode, players start from the beginning and play straight through for the highest score possible. In Story mode, players unlock new stages and achievements while playing through the game.
* Players control either Billy or Jimmy with a virtual joystick and attack buttons. You can customize your controls for the perfect setup. You can increase or decrease the size of the buttons, reduce their opacity, and relocate them anywhere on the screen that makes you feel more comfortable.
* Punch, kick, knee, elbow, and head-butt your enemies. Don’t forget to pick up nearby items to use as attack weapons. Grab crates, chains, and whatever else you can find to throw at the bad guys.
* There are also three levels of difficulty; mobile, original, and expert. Mobile is specially balanced for mobile games. Original is nearly identical to the classic arcade version. Expert is self-explanatory.
* The iOS version of the Double Dragon Trilogy comes with a newly remastered soundtrack. However, if you are a purist, you can switch over to the original 8-bit version for total flashback fun.

* Of course, Double Dragon wouldn’t be the same if it didn’t include co-op mode. Connect your game with a friend in the same room via Bluetooth to fight as both Billy and Jimmy at the same time for double the damage.
* This iOS game is compatible with most Bluetooth enabled game controller devices.
* Doubel Dragon Trilogy is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It is on sale for $2.99 to celebrate the official launch. Download it in the App Store today.
* Did you play the Double Dragon games when they first came out? Are you excited to see the iOS launch?
