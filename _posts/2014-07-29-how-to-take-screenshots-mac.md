* There are plenty applications, both paid and free, which allow you to grab screenshots, such as Skitch from Evernote, for example. But allow me to let you in on a dirty little secret: you don’t need any of them.
* Assuming you’re in the vast majority of the population whose needs don’t go beyond grabbing screens, or are among the group that has no use for advanced annotation and image management capabilities, Apple has you covered.
* I myself have never used a third-party app to grab screenshots. How’s so? Because macOS sports a compelling set of built-in shortcuts for taking different types of screen images in an instant, without having to even launch any kind of app.
* Still, it’s surprising just how many folks are totally oblivious to the fact they can capture Mac screenshots. That being said, we’ve reckoned to do something about it.
* This comprehensive tutorial will teach you how to take screenshots on your Mac like a pro and have fun in the process.
*  
* Before we get going, here is a summary of what we’re going to look at:
* Table of contents
* OK, here we go.
* Step 1: This one’s a no-brainer. Just hit the ⌘-Shift-3 key combo simultaneously and macOS will capture a full-resolution image of whatever is displayed on the whole screen. Here’s a screenshot of my 5k Retina iMac desktop.

* Tip: You can use the key combo to capture the whole screen at any time, even if you’re in the middle of dragging an item in Finder. Here I’ve captured my desktop whilst dragging the Messages app around.

* Step 1: To capture a custom rectangular portion of the screen, use the ⌘-Shift-4 keystroke. This will turn the mouse pointer into a crosshair symbol like this.

* Step 2: To select your capture area, first position the cursor in its upper left corner.
* Step 3: Now hold down the mouse button, drag to define the rectangular area and release to capture. Here’s an example screenshot of iTunes on my desktop.

* Can you see what’s wrong with this picture?
* Yeah, the desktop wallpaper is visible in the background. Yes, I could have tediously restricted my capture area to the window boundaries.
* That would have been of little help because windows in macOS have rounder corners, requiring additional steps in an image editing app to remove unwanted pixels.
* Wouldn’t it be great if macOS allowed you to grab only an app window and nothing else?
* Step 1: To capture a specific window, first hit ⌘-Shift-4 on the keyboard and then press the Space bar. The mouse pointer will turn into a camera symbol.
* Step 2: Now move the camera pointer over the window to highlight it before pressing the mouse button. Voila! The image of the window – and window alone – is captured.
* Here’s a screenshot of the Applications folder in a Finder window.

* This works with open Finder windows, modal windows, panels and most app windows.
* Tip: I’m willing to eat my hat if your desktop isn’t littered with multiple windows. macOS handles these types of scenarios with ease. You just move the camera pointer over a desired window – it doesn’t have to be in the foreground – press the mouse button and OS X will do the right thing.
* Here you can see me capturing a Finder window that’s in the background, without bringing it to the foreground first.

* Sometimes, you may want to grab specific parts of the Mac’s interface other than windows. For instance, you may want to capture an app’s menu or the Mac’s menu bar.
* Worry not, Apple has you covered!
* Step 1: Press ⌘-Shift-4 and then Space. Now drag the camera pointer to highlight the menu bar. Release the mouse button to capture.

* Tip: To capture a screenshot of third-party and OS X system menu bar icons sitting in the right corner of the Mac’s menu bar, just move the camera pointer over a specific icon or an icon group and then click the mouse button.
* Here’s a screenshot of Apple’s standard system icons.

* As you can see for yourself, capturing the menu bar items removes the gray menu shade altogether, leaving you only with plain pictograms.
* Step 1: First, you need to click the menu in order to reveal its contents.
* Step 2: Next, press ⌘-Shift-4 and drag the camera pointer over a desired area. Release the mouse button to capture.

* On the downside, this method requires pixel-perfect precision to ensure that the selection area includes only menu graphics. Fortunately, there’s a better way.
* Step 1: Click the menu to reveal its contents.
* Step 2: Now press ⌘-Shift-4 and then Space bar. Highlight the drop-down menu with the camera pointer, like this, and click the mouse button to capture.

* This is what you’ll end up with.

* Sweet, no?
* Tip: If you author tutorials or how-tos, perhaps you want to emphasize a specific menu item? You can do that, too.
* Simply highlight a menu item before hitting the ⌘-Shift-4 and Space bar combo. Above is Safari’s Safari menu with the “Safari Extensions…” option highlighted in grey.
* Tip: If for some reason you want to delay the capture for a few seconds, use the stock macOS app called Grab – it’s in your Applications folder.
* Available under Grab’s Capture menu, you can choose to grab a Selection, Window, Screen or Timed Screen.

* After choosing Timed Screen and hitting the Start Timer button, Grab will capture the screen after ten seconds. The app offers other features that will take your screenshot-taking skills to the next level so it pays to spend some time with Grab to see how it works for you.
* Grab offers eight custom pointers and lets you turn off the capture sound.
* One of the great features about Grab that you don’t get when capturing screenshots via keystrokes is its pointer which shows pixel coordinates for ultimate control. It’s also cool that it lets you capture the whole screen with a custom pointer superimposed where you click.
* To see information about the screenshot, choose Edit > Inspector. Note that Grab only saves screenshots in the TIFF format.
* Screenshot the entire screen ― ⌘-Shift-3
* Screenshot some of your screen ― ⌘-Shift-4, then drag the crosshair pointer over a desired area and release the mouse button. You can use one of the modifier keys below, or a combination of them, while dragging.
* Modifier keys – For accurate control over the area selection, use one or more modifier keys listed below. After invoking either the ⌘-Shift-3 or ⌘-Shift-4 combo, start dragging the crosshair pointer to select your capture area. Now release the keys while continuing to press the mouse button and then hold one or more of the modifier keys. This will change how the selection area is being defined, as described below. When you’re ready to take a picture, release the mouse button.
* Shift ― Resize the selection area only horizontally or vertically. Option ― Resize the selection area from the center out. Space bar ― Move the selection area around.
* Screenshot to clipboard ― Hold down the Control key while you press the other keys to save the screenshot in clipboard so you can paste the image directly into a document.
* Screenshot a specific window ― ⌘-Shift-4 then Space bar. Move the camera pointer over a window to highlight it and then click the mouse button.
* Screenshot the Mac’s menu bar ― ⌘-Shift-4 and then Space bar. Now move the camera pointer to highlight the Mac’s menu bar and click the mouse button.
* Screenshot a menu ― First click a menu to reveal its contents. Then hit ⌘-Shift-4, drag the crosshair pointer over a desired area and release the mouse button.
* Screenshot a menu without the title ― Click the menu to reveal its contents. Hit ⌘-Shift-4 and then Space bar. Now move the camera pointer to highlight the pull-down menu and click the mouse button.
* Cancel any screenshot in progress ― ESC before you click.
* You can always bring up these shortcuts using the Mac’s built-in help.
* Just type “screenshot” into the Finder’s Help menu and choose “Take pictures of the screen” from the list of available resources.
* I hope you find this tutorial helpful.
* The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words couldn’t be more true. With that in mind, let me once again emphasize that it pays to learn a few simple keystrokes to become the Master Screenshot-Taker.
