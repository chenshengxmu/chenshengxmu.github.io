* It’s finally here. After what seemed like an infinite beta test, biteSMS 6.0 has hit Cydia for public download.
* With it comes all of the features you’ve come to know and love, plus a few surprises and UI enhancements. Best of all, it’s a free download if you’ve purchased an older version of biteSMS. Check out our video coverage inside…
* I think it’s safe to say that this is the best biteSMS to date. It was already a solid app before, but with the iOS 5 integration, it’s even better.
* The UI enhancements will probably be a personal matter, but I think they are more than suitable. I especially love the new QuickCompose and QuickReply Notification Center integration, and the new ability to use the default Messages icon, and hide the stock Messages app.
* Just a reminder, you must have a jailbroken iDevice in order to use biteSMS.
* What do you think about the new biteSMS? Was it worth the wait? Would you recommend it to new users for $8.99?
