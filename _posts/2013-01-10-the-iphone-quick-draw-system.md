* What’s your take on belt clip cell phone holsters? I used to sell cell phones, and I would cringe every time a customer would buy one. They’d say, “it’s just so accessible.” I even had one guy show me how much faster it was taking it out of the holster than it was his pocket. Ok.
* But what if you want that kind of accessibility, without the fashion faux pas? Then you might be a candidate for this new iPhone quick-draw system. The contraption fits around your arm, and catapults your iPhone from under your sleeve to your hand in milliseconds…

* Ok, so the system’s not exactly ready to ship yet. And frankly, we’re not sure that it serves any kind of purpose beyond making us laugh a little bit this morning. But people seem to love it — the video has garnered nearly 200,000 hits since it was posted yesterday afternoon.
* We couldn’t find much info on the inventor either. The clip resides on the WATCHSARETV1 YouTube channel, with the title ‘Japanese Guy’s iPhone Quick-Draw System.’ And the description just says: “Listen, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take missed calls anymore.”
* Sooo…what are your thoughts on the video?
