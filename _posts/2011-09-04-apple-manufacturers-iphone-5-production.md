* A report from Japanese site Macotakara claims that Apple OEM manufacturers have begun iPhone 5 production for an October launch. Foxconn will allegedly assemble 85% of the units, with Petragon accounting for 15% of production volume.
* While iPhone 5 units are being assembled, Apple has yet to install iOS 5 on the devices. This is due to the fact that iOS 5 is still in the final beta stages, and the software will be installed on the new hardware when it reaches its final GM version in the coming weeks.
* Foxconn will produce the bulk of Apple’s orders, with Petragon slated for a much smaller percentage. The unit volume for Petragon production matches up with a previous report.
* The report from Macotakara states that sources overseas project an early October launch for the iPhone 5, based on production roadmaps. We’ve been hearing a late September to early October timeframe for Apple’s next announcement already, so we have reason to believe that this new report is legitimate.
* If the iPhone 5 has indeed entered the production stages, a release is imminent. The iPhone is expected to sport an A5 processor, 8 megapixel camera, and a larger display. The device could also feature a tapered design with an aluminum body. The iPhone 4 will most likely be re-tooled with cheaper components and dual baseband support.
* Both devices should be featured in Apple’s next announcement, which is expected to take place in the coming weeks.
