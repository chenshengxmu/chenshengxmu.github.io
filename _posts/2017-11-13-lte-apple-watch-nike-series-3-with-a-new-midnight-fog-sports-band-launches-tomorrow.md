* Nike announced Monday that the special edition Apple Watch Nike+ Series 3 with a new Midnight Fog sport loop will be available to purchase starting Tuesday, November 14.
* This latest limited-edition band is a result of the partnership between Apple and Nike that saw the creation of special Nike+ editions of Series 2 and Series 3 watches.
* Following last year’s Day to Night collection, the new Midnight Fog sport band has deep greys with iridescent accents. This band colorway will be available tomorrow with the purchase of the $399 Nike Apple Watch Cellular + GPS edition at nike.com and Nike retail stores.
