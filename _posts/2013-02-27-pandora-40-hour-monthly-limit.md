* Popular internet radio service Pandora announced today that it is implementing a new 40-hour-per-month limit on mobile listening. The announcement was made this afternoon via the company’s blog, by founder Tim Westergren.
* For most folks, this won’t mean anything. Westergren says that Pandora’s average users spend approximately 20 hours per month listening to Pandora across all devices. But for the 4% or so that go over, you’ll have to start paying up…
* From Westergren’s blog post entitled ‘A note to our listeners.’
* “This week we will begin communicating directly with a small number of our listeners as we introduce a 40-hour-per-month limit on free mobile listening.
* Most of you reading this will never hit the limit. In fact, it will affect less than 4% of our total monthly active listeners. For perspective, the average listener spends approximately 20 hours listening to Pandora across all devices in any given month.”
* The reason for the new cap? Money, of course. Apparently Pandora’s per-track royalty rates have increased more than 25% over the last 3 years, and continue to rise. The company is hoping this new plan will offset some of those extra costs.
* Starting next month, users who hit the new limit will have a few options. One, they can continue to listen to Pandora on a computer. Two, they can pay a one-time $0.99 fee to keep listening on mobile for the remainder that month. Or three, sign up for Pandora One.
* Pandora one, for those who aren’t familiar with it, is Pandora’s premium listening service. It’s $3.99 per month, or $36 per year, and it offers users higher quality audio, no advertisements, and other features—similar to that of Spotify or Rdio.
