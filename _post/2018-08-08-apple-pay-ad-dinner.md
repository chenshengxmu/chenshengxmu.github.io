* Yesterday, Apple’s official YouTube channel published yet another short advertisement designed to promote the company’s peer-to-peer mobile payment service, Apple Pay Cash.
* The 15-second ad is part of the firm’s “Just Text Them the Money” ad campaign for its mobile payment service. The video highlights making group dinner payments through an iMessage.
* It’s a pretty amusing ad, have a look below.
* “Send and request cash with Apple Pay in Messages—use it to shop in stores, online and in apps,” reads the video’s description.
* Apple Pay Cash is currently only available in the United States.
* According to the company’s own iOS Feature Availability webpage, Apple Pay at the time of this writing was available in nearly 30 countries around the world.
