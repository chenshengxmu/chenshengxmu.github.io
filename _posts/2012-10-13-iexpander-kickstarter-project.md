* Do you ever wish your iPhone had better battery life, or expandable storage? How about a brighter flash, so it could take better pictures in low-light situations? Well let me introduce you to the iExpander.
* The iExpander is a case for your iPhone that, believe or not, does all of these things. It has a built-in battery, a micro SD card slot, and an enhanced flash. Like the title says, it’s like steroids for your iPhone…
* The iExpander is constructed of graphite reinforced nylon, which is both extremely durable and flexible. And despite all of its added features, the case only adds 6.33mm in thickness to your handset.
* The built-in battery is of the Li Polymer variety, the same one Apple uses in the iPhone. And the micro SD card slot can read cards up to 64GB, and stores and transfers any iPhone-compatible content. The developers also seem pretty psyched about the case’s enhanced LED flash and its capabilities.
* With just 8 days left to go in its Kickstarter funding round, the project has raised just $120,000 of its $125,00 goal. So if you’re interested in the iExpander, you’ll want to pledge $75 or more to get on board. The cool thing is, the pledge can go towards a case fit for the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, or yes, even an iPhone 5.
* Though a lot of folks may find the iExpander to be overkill, or too bulky, it seems like the case will be a home run with power iPhone users. In fact, the extra battery alone is almost worth the money.
* What do you think of the iExpander?
