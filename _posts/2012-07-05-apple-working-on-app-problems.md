* As we mentioned earlier today, the App Store was recently struck with a programming glitch, causing a number of Mac and iOS apps to crash upon update.
* The issue has been causing a lot of problems for app developers, who have been receiving 1 star reviews and non-stop support requests over the last 24 hours.
* This afternoon, Apple officially acknowledged the bug…
* TechCrunch reports:
* “According to developer sources, Apple has now responded to numerous complaints in its Developer Forums with a brief statement posted by username “iTunesConnect.” The statement reads: “We are aware of the issue related to apps crashing after update. We are currently working on resolving the issue. Stay tuned for updates.”
* The report goes on to say that Apple has already emailed several developers regarding the glitch, and that it now has a dedicated team looking into problem.
* It’s been a rough couple of days for the App Store team, which has had a fairly spotless record up until now. Aside from this updating bug, it’s also been dealing with a malicious spam application, that was discovered in the App Store early this morning.
