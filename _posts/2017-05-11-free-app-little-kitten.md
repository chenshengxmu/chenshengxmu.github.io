* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with Little Kitten. For the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pick up the app for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $2.
* From App Store Editors’ Notes:
* The moment we met wee kitty Crumbs in Little Kitten, we let out an audible “Awww.” This adorable digital feline encourages children to play and explore, interacting with the lively toys and simple games in Crumbs’ room. We’re amazed by the cinematic animation, and appreciate the sleep timer that sends Crumbs to bed when our kids’ screen time is over.
* And here’s a clip of Crumbs in action:
* Again, Little Kitten is available in the App Store for free.
