* Samsung is taking a page from Microsoft’s book with the release of a new ad featuring side-by-side comparison of its 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab Pro and Apple’s iPad. Not only that, Samsung has actually borrowed the concept of Apple’s inaugural iPad Air commercial dubbed ‘Pencil’ and applied it to its ad.
* The ad titled ‘Multitasking Redefined’ highlights Samsung device’s multitasking capabilities allowing it to render two apps side-by-side, because “doing two things at once is greater than doing one thing at once”.
* The 60-second video proudly proclaims the Galaxy Tab 10.1 to be an even thinner tablet than the iPad Air despite a negligible difference in their thickness. There’s also another ad which uses a video of a LeBron James slam dunk to mock the iPhone’s screen size.
* Here it is…

* For those wondering, the Samsung device is 7.3mm thick versus 7.5mm for the iPad Air. The 0.2mm difference is enough of a justification to call the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 thinner than the iPad Air.
* In the case of the screen resolution, Samsung has a point: the Apple tablet’s Retina screen maxes out at 1,536-by-2,048 pixels (264ppi) while Samsung’s device packs even more pixels at a whopping 1,600-by-2,560 pixel resolution (299ppi)
* But Samsung didn’t stop there.
* Another commercial pits the iPhone’s “non-HD” four-inch display to the Galaxy Note 3’s HD screen measuring 5.7 inches diagonally, using a video of a LeBron James slam dunk.
* “Shouldn’t we enjoy this high-definition jam on a screen that’s actually high-definition?” asks the voiceover. “5.7 inches of HD… or 4.0 inches of non-HD.”

* I’m not sure I appreciate the “LeBron’s literally running away from this phone” part.
* Do you like the ads or has Samsung gone too far taking swipes at the iPhone and iPad?
