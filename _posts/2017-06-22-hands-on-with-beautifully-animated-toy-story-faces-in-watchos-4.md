* Aside from bringing more intelligence and fitness features to Apple Watch, the new watchOS 4 software includes a bunch of beautifully animated Toy Story faces. Not unlike the existing Mickey and Minnie Mouse watch faces, the Toy Story ones bring to life popular Pixar characters including Woody, Jessie, Buzz Lightyear, Ham, Rex and Bullseye.
* Our own Andrew O’Hara did a quick video showing off almost all the character animations available in the new Toy Story watch faces in watchOS 4, including additional customizations.
* Give the video a quick watch, then meet us in comments.
* watchOS 4 packs in other new watch faces.
* Kaleidoscope, for instance, turns static images into mesmerizing patterns and the new Siri watch face uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to display the information users need most throughout the day.
* ROUNDUP: 60+ new features in watchOS 4
* Plus, you have new complications for your watch faces, including Now Playing and Apple News.
* These new watch faces, complications and other features all require watchOS 4, a free upgrade for all Apple Watch users later this year.
