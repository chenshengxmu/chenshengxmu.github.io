* Elgato Systems announced Wednesday that it’s renaming itself to Eve Systems and selling its successful gaming business to the gaming peripherals maker Corsair. Under Corsair, Eve gaming will continue as a separate brand.
* Elgato founder and CEO Markus Fest said in a prepared statement:
* Today, the Gaming space is more dynamic and exciting than ever, and we sought a larger partner to help us capitalize on the phenomenal opportunities ahead. Our gaming business has been wildly successful, and that success is inextricably linked to the Elgato brand.
* The brand has been with us for almost twenty years and we are obviously a little sad to see it go, but Corsair is a fantastic company and will be a great new home for Elgato. At the same time our Eve product line will benefit from a focused team and a dedicated organization. This move will further strengthen both product families.
* This does not change anything in terms of Elgato’s commitment to supporting Apple’s HomeKit platform with its accessories for controlling and automating devices and various appliances designed to monitor your indoor and outdoor environments, including sprinkler controllers.
