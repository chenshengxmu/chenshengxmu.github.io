* iOS 5 has tons of new features and additions that can make your life a little bit easier. The Lock screen camera icon can help you snap photos quicker, and Shortcuts can make typing long phrases and URLs a breeze.
* There’s also a new feature called Dictionary which, as you might have guessed, enables you to look up the definitions of words on the fly. Dictionary is available system-wide, and can be accessed quickly with a single tap…
* In almost any application that allows you to select text, you can access iOS 5’s dictionary. Simply tap-to-select a word like you would to cut or copy. In most apps, you’ll get the Define option, but in other apps like iBooks, the option is labeled Dictionary.

* Either way, tapping the option will bring up a definition page that includes all kinds of information. Not only does it give you the meaning(s) of the word, it will also give examples of how to use it in a sentence and its origin if possible.
* A downside of the feature is that its library of definitions seems to be rather small. If it doesn’t recognize a word, you won’t get the Define option when selecting text. But as a general quick-reference tool, iOS 5’s built-in dictionary works great.
