* Creating custom ringtones is possible without jailbreaking, but it’s still not the simplest feat in the world.
* Jailbreaking, on the other hand, makes creating custom ringtones extremely easy.
* AnyRing is one such jailbreak app dedicated to creating custom ringtones, SMS alerts, and mail alerts. Check out our video highlights of the recently updated app inside.
* AnyRing has been around for quite a while, and was most recently updated to include compatibility with the popular jailbreak tweak entitled CallBar.
* The premise behind AnyRing is to let you create your own custom tones using the songs on your Music app, your voice, a music search, a YouTube video, and more.
* Once a song has been selected, you can choose to to loop it, and adjust its duration. It’s a very thoughtful and well laid out jailbreak app that lends you the ability to create custom tones for all, or even specific contacts.
* There’s also the ability to share tones with other AnyRing users via Bluetooth, if that’s your thing.
* I know some people have had issues with AnyRing in the past, but this update has worked flawlessly for me on my jailbroken iPhone 4S.
* Even at $3.99 (there is a free trial), it’s hard not to recommend an app that lets you customize your ringtones in such an easy manner.
* If you’re interested in trying out AnyRing, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download a free trial.
* What’s your experience been with AnyRing?
* Update: No, for those asking, this does not require iTunes, syncing, etc. Just select a ringtone and go.
