* During Apple’s Q3 earnings call this afternoon, Tim Cook praised the success of its iTunes software and services arm. The CEO said the division was the fastest-growing of the company’s business in the first 9 months of its fiscal year 2014.
* The segment generated $4.5 billion in revenue during the 3-month period, an increase of 12% YoY (or year over year). And Cook attributed the growth to a number of factors, including growing interest in China and strong App Store numbers…
* Among those numbers are accumulative app downloads, which recently crossed the 75 billion mark. Cook also said that Apple has now paid out a total of $20 billion to developers, which is up $5 billion from the amount he gave back in January.
* Tim predicts that the growth will continue, and possibly even accelerate, after Apple releases iOS 8 this year. The update offers new platforms with HealthKit and HomeKit, 4000+ new APIs, and several other things that should appease developers.
* For a while now, Apple’s iTunes segment has been seen as a sleeping giant by many pundits. While others are worried about iPhone and iPad growth, the software and services division has been flying under the radar, nearly doubling year over year.
* Apple announced earlier this year that it has more than 800 million iTunes accounts, which is believed to be one of the largest credit card hubs in existence.
