* Apple on Friday seeded the fifth beta of tvOS 11.2.5. The update comes just a few days after beta 4 was released, and it can be downloaded on the Apple TV by registered developers who have installed the appropriate profile via Xcode.
* We have yet to see any new user-facing features or changes in the tvOS 11.2.5 betas, suggesting that the update is focused on under-the-hood improvements. We expect the same for Apple’s other platform updates currently in testing.
* We’re currently installing beta 5, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any significant findings. See any notable differences in today’s beta we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
