* The refreshed MacBook Pros sound like the notebooks Apple should’ve created in the first place so I went ahead to maxed out the flagship 2018 MacBook Pro model on the web store.
* What I’ve eventually ended up with is a $6,669 notebook, which is the same price as the fully-loaded Mac Pro configuration and significantly less than the maxed-out 2017 iMac Pro all-in-one at an eye-watering $13,348.
* I picked the flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID, featuring a 2.6GHz 6-core Intel Core i7 processor, 512GB SSD storage, 16GB of 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM and Radeon Pro 560X graphics with 4GB of dedicated GDDR5 video memory.
* Here are the three basic upgrades I chose:
* The above upgrades drove the model’s $2,799 price to a cool $6,699.
* This is $2,400 more than the maxed-out 2017 MacBook Pro, but that’s because Apple now offers more powerful upgrade options which cost more, like 32GB RAM or 4GB SSD.
* Another way to look at it: that kind of money could buy you an aging Mac Pro configured with a 2.7GHz 12-core processor, 64GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, which isn’t saying you should buy a Mac Pro instead because Apple’s pro desktop is undergoing some serious rethinking with a drastically redesigned modular Mac Pro due sometime next year.
* By the way, had I also picked other suggested upgrades for my MacBook Pro—like Final Cut Pro X ($299), Logic Pro X ($199) and that wonderful but pricey leather sleeve from Apple—I’d have ended up with a $7,098 bill.
* Fun fact: the base models of the MacBook Pro family still cost the same as last year’s models, starting at $1,799 for the 13-inch model or $2,399 for the 15-inch model.
* We don’t mean this to be a rant about overpriced Apple hardware because prices is what you pay for. Apple uses only top-notch components in its machines and the MacBook Pro series is not a notebook for people who just want to surf the web, check their email, use social media and play light games.
* Thoughts?
