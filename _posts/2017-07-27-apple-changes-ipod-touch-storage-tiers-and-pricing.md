* Following news that it has officially discontinued iPod nano and iPod shuffle, the two iPod models that didn’t run iOS, Apple today made some changes to the iPod touch lineup.
* “Today, we are simplifying our iPod lineup with two models of iPod touch now with double the capacity starting at just $199 and we are discontinuing the iPod shuffle and iPod nano,” an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider in an email.
* The touchscreen-outfitted iOS device—often unfairly referred to as “an iPhone minus the phone part”—now comes with twice the storage while bringing pricing down by up to $100.
* The previous 16/32/64/128GB storage tiers priced at $199/$249/$299/$399 have been replaced with the 32GB and 128GB models at reduced prices as the only options.

* The 32-gigabyte iPod touch is now priced at $199 while its 128-gigabyte counterpart will set you back $299 in the United States.
* The 16GB and 64GB storage options have been removed from the lineup.
* The revised iPod touch lineup continues to be available in the same colors as previously: Silver, Gold, Space Gray, Pink, Blue and Red. In July of 2015, iPod touch was updated with a faster A8 chip, an eight-megapixel shooter out the back, faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi and more.
* Fun fact: Apple no longer sells any traditional music players.
