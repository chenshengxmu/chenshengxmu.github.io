* Wunderlist is an awesome list/to-do cross-platform solution that everyone should try out.
* Created by Berlin, Germany-based 6Wunderkinder, the application is provided free of charge and available across key mobile and desktop platforms so your lists and notes don’t get tied and locked up to a specific device, or vendor or platform, as they shouldn’t be.
* Following a massive 3.0 refresh with all-new UI and 60+ new features, Wunderkinder today issued the first maintenance update bringing out several improvements and fixing a nagging which has prevented some people from migrating from the previous version…
* Wunderlist 3 used to crash a lot on my iPad and the 3.0.1 update seems to have fixed this. The annoying Due Date and timezone bugs have also been squashed.
* More importantly, issues preventing some people from migrating from Wunderlist 2 have been addresses. Scroll down for an overview of other enhancements and feature additions.
