* Facebook-owned Instagram on Monday announced a brand new mobile application called Layout, dedicated to making interesting photo collages.
* Layout from Instagram is rolling out today for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. The app will be available as a free download in the App Store. Currently only available for iOS, Layout will be available for Android in the coming months.
* Layout, as the name suggests, lets you easily combine multiple photos into a single image. “It’s fun, it’s simple and it gives you a new way to flex your creativity,” says the firm.
* Upon opening the app, you’ll be greeted with thumbnails of custom layouts you can use as a starting point. You can import photos from your iOS Camera roll to use in a collage, or take snaps as you go using the Photo Booth feature.
* “Tap it to start a countdown and capture photos that you’ll instantly see in a layout,” reads the description. There’s also a Faces feature that shows you all the photos in your Camera roll that feature people, which makes it easier to find the photos you want.

* Customizing layouts is as easy as dragging and dropping photos to rearrange them. You can crop your photos using pinch to zoom or pull the sides of a photo to adjust its size.
* “Then flip and rotate your photos to create cool arrangements and mirror effects,” says Instagram.
* Again, Layout is rolling as we speak and these things usually take anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours to propagate through Apple’s iTunes servers globally so try again if you don’t see the app yet via the below link.
* Instagram Layout highlights:
* More information on Layout is available in Instagram’s Help article. The 4.8-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Layout from Instagram free in the App Store.
