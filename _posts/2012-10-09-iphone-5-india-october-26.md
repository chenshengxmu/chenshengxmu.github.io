* The iPhone 5 hit the United States, Canada and seven international markets on September 21 and a week later rolled out in 22 new countries. Notable absent was India, a 1.24 billion people market. According to a new report, Indians will be able to get their hands on the sought-after smartphone on Friday, October 26…
* BGR India has the story:
* Apple will be distributing the iPhone 5 in India on its own rather than relying on its carrier partners. We expect the iPhone 5 to have a wider availability unlike the past where it was not available readily everywhere.
* We also hear that the iPhone 5 would be priced closer to the launch price of the iPhone 4S, which recently got a price drop. However, at this point of time we are not sure about the number of units available initially considering Apple is facing supply constraints globally.
* Apple said it sold five million iPhone 5 units during the opening weekend and promised to make this year’s iteration of the iconic smartphone available in over a hundred countries and across 240 carriers by Christmas.
* Considering that India is home to the largest concentration of people living below the World Bank’s international poverty line of $1.25 per day, Apple may want to re-think its exorbitant pricing model for the country.
* If BGR is right, then the country’s leading carriers Airtel and Aircel, along with others, will be offering tariff plans tailored to the iPhone 5. Whether this means affordable prices and reasonable cost of ownership remains to be seen.
