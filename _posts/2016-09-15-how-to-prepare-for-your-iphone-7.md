* Many anxious Apple customers are anticipating their new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus handsets and are scheduled to receive them as early as this Friday.
* Some customers are dealing with shipping times extending as far out into the future as October or November, but regardless of how long you’ll be waiting, everyone who bought an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus has one thing in common: we should all be preparing for the day when it arrives.
* Being prepared for the new iPhone will help you to have a seamless transition from your current handset to the new one, and there are some preliminary steps you can and should follow.
* Although some people don’t mind starting out completely fresh when they get a new iPhone in the mail, others like to migrate their existing files and data from their current iPhone to their new one.
* This is done by backing up your iPhone’s data. You can do this one of two ways: through iCloud, or through iTunes.
* I will say from experience that iTunes seems to be a far more reliable way of backing up your information, and if you don’t have reliable access to the internet, then iTunes is a great way to back up your information locally instead of online.
* As you probably know by now, the new iPhone doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, Apple wants you to use Lightning-based headphones or wireless Bluetooth headphones like the newly-unveiled Apple AirPods.
* Apple includes a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter in the box with the iPhone 7, but we think it might get a little old to use when you realize the adapter is going to get in the way of charging your device as the battery level gets low.

* As a result, you may want to prepare for your upcoming iPhone by thinking ahead of time about what you want to use to listen to your music.
* If you need help figuring out what headphones to get, we have a comprehensive roundup of 7 great Bluetooth headphones to try with your new iPhone 7.
* The new iPhone isn’t cheap, as always, but the cost paired with the unfortunate caveat that the new Jet Black finish is prone to micro-abrasions from everyday use, spell out a very good reason to put your new iPhone in some sort of case for protection.
* We know it seems counter-productive for such a beautiful device to be covered up in a piece of flimsy plastic and rubber, but when it comes to protecting your investment, it’s money well spent. In fact, you might want to consider buying a case ahead of time so that you have protection for your new iPhone before it even reaches your doorstep.
* Because there are so many cases out there to choose from, we made a roundup of 6 great cases you can buy for the iPhone 7 right now to get you started.
* After upgrading to a new iPhone, it’s always a tough choice to decide what you’re going to do with your retired Apple device.
* Some people like to hold onto them and save them for a rainy day, such as when your new iPhone breaks (knock on wood), while others like to cash in on what they’re worth to go towards the cost of upgrading to their new iPhone.
* If you will be selling your iPhone, remember to restore the device to factory settings ahead of time to keep your personal data from being read.
* Obviously, don’t sell your device until after you have your new one in hand. As for me, I’ll probably be keeping my old iPhone around for an iOS 10 jailbreak if one ever rolls around
* Are you prepared for your new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? Share in the comments below what you did to get ready.
