* As pointed out on Twitter by @Pix3lDemon, the website setup for the upcoming evasi0n jailbreak tool strongly hints at a Sunday release. While this isn’t entirely surprising, seeing as members of the evad3rs themselves hinted at a Super Bowl day release, it does reafirm the belief that Sunday, will indeed be Funday.
* As you’ll see on the evasi0n.com splash page, each device that shows a visible Calendar icon is displaying a ‘3’. It just so happens that the first Sunday in February is on the 3rd. Coincidence? Probably not. Check past the break for the screenshot.

* So there you have it. If you have anything planned on Sunday, and chances are you will, I suggest you plan around the jailbreak release.
* Thanks, Pix3lDemon.
