* Update: Pangu jailbreak for iOS 9 released!
* Surprise. The iOS 9 jailbreak that we just talked about appears to be legit, and there is now a download link available. The tool is only available for Windows users at this time. The Pangu tool for iOS 9 works with iOS 9, iOS 9.0.1, and iOS 9.0.2. There’s no word on whether it works with the beta releases at this time.
* You can download Pangu for iOS 9 from our downloads page.
* We’ll be back with a full tutorial. In the meantime, are you happy?
