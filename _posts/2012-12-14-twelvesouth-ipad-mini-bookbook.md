* The BookBook case line is perhaps one of the most popular on the market. Twelve South makes them for a number of Apple products including MacBooks, iPads and iPhones. And, as the name suggests, they all sport a similar leather-bound book design.
* Last month, Twelve South updated its iPhone BookBook case to support the new iPhone 5. And this week, it’s released a version of it for the iPad mini…
* From TwelveSouth’s blog:
* “The featherweight BookBook for iPad mini weighs just 7.5 ounces, and is carefully crafted with genuine, hand-distressed leather so no two are exactly alike. Outside you’ll see the tiny BookBook has hardback book covers and a rigid spine to provide impact and crush protection for iPad mini. Open BookBook for iPad mini with its dual zippers to reveal a soft, sueded, luxury lining that protects the screen.”
* New features for the mini BookBook include a spine that allows users to hold their iPad mini without fingers blocking the screen. And the case also turns into a wedge stand, perfect for typing, and a display stand for watching movies (kind of like a Smart Cover).
* Jeff reviewed the original iPhone version of the BookBook last year, and really liked it. But I’ve always thought they were took bulky to carry on a daily basis. I’m kind of digging this one for the iPad mini though, it looks really slim and it seems functional.
* If you’re interested, the iPad mini BookBook case is available in Twelve South’s web store for $69.99 and comes in black, brown and red.
* What do you think?
