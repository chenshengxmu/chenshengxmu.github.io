* Christian Bale may be playing Steve Jobs in Sony’s highly anticipated biopic of the Apple co-founder, reports Variety. Citing sources familiar with the project, the outlet says it can confirm that the Oscar-winning actor is currently in talks for the part.
* Perhaps best recognized for playing Bruce Wayne in the popular Dark Knight trilogy, Bale has taken on a variety of roles over the years. He’s well known in the industry for his ability to alter both his appearance and accent to better portray characters.
* Aside from Bale, other actors have been considered for the part, including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Bradley Cooper. If he signs on, he’d join the likes of Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle, and award-winning writer Aaron Sorkin.
* Sorkin, who completed and turned in the screenplay in January, says the story consists of 3 30-minute scenes leading up to Apple product launches. The film has yet to receive a release date, but early rumors suggested production would start this fall.
