* Apple has received numerous awards throughout the years for its incredible success in the tech industry, and now Apple has received recognition once again from Forbes.
* Forbes Magazine has compiled a list of the world’s most innovative companies based on what it calls “the five skills of disruptive innovators.” 
* “Questioning allows innovators to challenge the status quo and consider new possibilities;
* Observing helps innovators detect small details—in the activities of customers, suppliers and other companies—that suggest new ways of doing things
* Networking permits innovators to gain radically different perspectives from individuals with diverse backgrounds;
* Experimenting prompts innovators to relentlessly try out new experiences, take things apart and test new ideas;
* Associational thinking—drawing connections among questions, problems or ideas from unrelated fields—is triggered by questioning, observing, networking and experimenting and is the catalyst for creative ideas.”
* In this list, Cupertino based Apple ranked fifth. Google also made the list, but surprisingly it ranked seventh. Microsoft was found near the bottom of the list, ranking 86th.
* Some notable mentions:
* Forbes’ World’s Most Innovative Companies: 1. Salesforce.com 2. Amazon.com 3. Intuitive Surgical 4. Tencent Holdings 5. Apple 6. Hindustan Unilever 7. Google 8. Natura Cosméticos 9. Bharat Heavy Electricals 10. Monsanto … 20. Nintendo … 54. Adobe Systems … 56. HTC Corp … 77. Oracle … 84. Intuit … 86. Microsoft
