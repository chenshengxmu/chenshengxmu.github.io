* RunKeeper has released a new iOS application that counts steps taken and tracks your activity. I know there are now dozens of apps in the App Store.
* That being said, RunKeeper is a huge player in fitness and Breeze is brilliantly designed, gamified and available totally free of charge, no in-app purchases required whatsoever.
* The software takes advantage of Apple’s M7 motion coprocessor inside the iPhone 5s to track up to seven days worth of activity, even when the app isn’t running and without taking any noticeable hit on your battery life.
* Breeze is a free download from the App Store. I’ve included nearly a dozen pretty screenshots and more information right after the break so give the app a whirl and let us know what you think in the comments…
* On first-run, the app will require your permission to access your motion data (to revoke access on a per-app basis, visit Settings > Privacy > Motion Activity). The iPhone 5s and iOS 7 tap the outstandingly power efficient M7 chip to count your steps and track your motion without engaging the main (and power-hungry) A7 processor.
* The chip saves up to a week’s worth of motion data any compatible app can tap into. As seen below, Breeze was able to retrieve my movement from the past seven days so I immediately had some solid data to work with.
* The design is stunning: UI elements are minimalist, the interface is clean and nicely animated and you’ll instantly feel right at home as every option is self-explanatory. If Nike’s M7-optimized Move app used to be the epitome of good design, Breeze has just taken fitness/tracking interfaces to a whole new level.

* As the app amasses info on your activity, you can access a history of your movement to see steps taken on any given day. Realizing average Joes may not necessarily be cognizant of how the M7 chip works, developers included a handy “How’d we get data from before you installer Breeze?” link at the bottom.

* Tapping it brings up a message explaining how this technology works. Developers have also made sure to underscore that the M7 chip never tracks location. That’s a nice and much welcomed touch so here’s to hoping that other M7-compatible apps follow suit.
* As can be seen on the above screenshots, the app analyzes your performance to determine your spirit animal – I am an impulsive lion, for instance.

* You can share your goals and achievements using standard options available in the iOS Share sheet, including posting charts as images to Flickr (which today received an insanely great update).

* Breeze is available free of charge in the App Store.
* As the app was designed with M7 in mind, you’ll need an iPhone 5s to enjoy it.
* If you use RunKeeper’s main iOS app, also a free download, you’ll love that it too supports tracking via the M7 chip.
