* Although Apple has taken some major steps to make the iPhone X durable, it’s still a $1,000 smartphone that’s mostly all screen. With this in mind, you may want to consider protecting the device with a case.
* Now, there are a ton of different cases out there that cater to different needs, but for this particular roundup we are going to be looking at thicker, tougher cases, meant to protect your device from harsh conditions.
* Here are the best rugged cases for iPhone X.

* The Defender Series line of cases from OtterBox has been around a long time and is synonymous with ‘rugged’ protection. It features a multi-layer design with a solid inner shell and soft outer cover to keep scratches and bumps at bay during drops and other mishaps. It has port covers to keep dust and debris, a belt-clip holster that doubles as a kickstand, and includes OtterBox’s limited lifetime warranty.

* The design of the Pathfinder from UAG just screams rugged. With its patented hard outer shell and soft impact resistant core, it looks like you could just throw this thing at the wall and it’d survive without a scratch. The case has a soft raised rubber lip around the display and rear skid pads that provide 360-degree protection for your device. It exceeds military stands for drop and shock protection, but is thin enough to still support wireless charging.

* Looking for a less expensive option? The Bolt from Zizo comes in under the $20 mark but still meets requirements for military grade protection. Its unique, shock-absorbing tetra-polyurethane design provides excellent protection and grip, without the bulk. Comes with a free screen protector, belt clip and built-in kickstand, and it’s compatible with Qi wireless charging pads.

* Here’s another option that falls under the $20 mark: the Unicorn Beetle Pro from SUPCASE. Yeah I know, but don’t judge this case by its name. It features the standard 2-layer design, with a flexible TPU inner shell and hard polycarbonate outer shell that helps protect against drops and falls. It also has a built-in screen protector, rotatable belt clip holster, covered buttons and fold-out port covers.

* This case is a little more on the expensive side, but in my opinion it’s worth the money. Lifeproof has long been a popular brand in the rugged case market (so much so that Otterbox acquired them), and having owned a few of their cases myself, I can attest to that. The FRE meets military standards for drops, plus it’s water and snow proof. It has a built-in screen protector and all ports and buttons are covered, but easily accessible.
* That’s all for now! Obviously we will update this list as we are made aware of and test new cases. And as always, if you have any good suggestions that we might have missed, feel free to let us know about them in the comments and we’ll check them out.
