* Looking at the feedback weâ€™ve been getting, it seems a lot of you will be happy to learn that the iDB app has been updated and now supports the larger screen of the iPhone X. Available in the App Store as version 1.4.2, this new release also brings support for Smart Invert Colors.
* A bunch of bugs have also been squashed, but quite frankly, you probably never experienced these bugs to begin with since they were mostly under the hood.
* The iDB app is available for free in the App Store. If you like what we do, want to support iDB, and improve your reading experience within the app, please consider subscribing, which will remove all ads from the app, provide unlimited bookmarking, and offline reading for your bookmarked articles.
* The die-hard iDB fan can subscribe for $0.99 per month. If money is tight but you still want to support iDB, there is also an option to subscribe for $2.99 per year.
* Thank you for your support!
