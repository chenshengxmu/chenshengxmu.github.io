* The developer of the popular jailbreak tweak known as Springtomize has given more details about the massive update he has planned. As we exclusively showed you last month, Springtomize 2 brings a whole host of improvements to the incredibly powerful jailbreak tweak.
* Filippo Bigarella, the developer, has given more details on the upcoming release, including Cydia availability and cost.
* On his personal blog, Filippo has stated that the iOS 5 update to Springtomize will be submitted to Cydia on December 2nd.
* Filippo plans to have an introductory price followed by a regular and update price in Cydia. He also does not plan to offer a lite version.
