* This fall, Apple is likely to introduce three new iPhones, including a second-generation 5.8-inch iPhone X, an all-new 6.1-inch LCD iPhone and 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus. To keep pace, Samsung’s expected to launch three new Galaxy S10 models early next year with similar screen sizes, according to Business Insider. 
* According to the noted Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities, the S10 lineup announced in 2019 will come with three models: one with a 5.8-inch screen, one with a 6.1-inch display, and one with a 6.4-inch screen.
* Perhaps the most significant new feature set to arrive on Samsung’s latest handsets is likely to be a “fingerprint on display,” or “FOD” reader. As its name suggests, this tool will allow users to scan their finger by placing it on the screen.
* The two higher-end S10 models should ship with the “ultrasonic FOD” feature, while the smaller Galaxy S10 will have the fingerprint sensor on the side of the device. Currently, the S9 and S9 Plus have a fingerprint reader on the back of the device.
* The S10 lineup could also include a so-called 3D-sensing camera.
* Kuo expects Samsung to “aggressively” advertise the FOD when the new devices arrive next year. After all, a  “fingerprint-on-display” isn’t something Apple plans on matching anytime soon.
* The 2018 iPhones, alongside the promised 2018 iPad Pro models, are all expected to feature Face ID for authentication purposes. That technology, which replaces Touch ID, is currently exclusive to the iPhone X.
* To keep its current customers happy, it’s undoubtedly in Samsung’s interest to keep pace with Apple over smartphone screen sizes. Nonetheless, I can’t see how this helps the company gain new customers, especially those from Apple.
* Due to weak Galaxy S9 sales, Samsung might introduce the S10 at the Consumer Electrics Show (CES) in January. But first, it will announce its other top-tier smartphone, the Galaxy Note 9, early next month.
* Meanwhile, Apple should announce its 2018 iPhone lineup in early September.
* Would you buy a Samsung device just to get a fingerprint-on-display?
