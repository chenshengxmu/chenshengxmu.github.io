* We know, or feel like we know, just about everything there is to know about Apple’s next tablet — except its name. Most websites, including us, have just been assuming that since it will be the third iPad, it will be called the iPad 3.
* But according to Gizmodo, the new device will actually be named the iPad HD. The site points to a couple of pieces of evidence to back its claims, including third-party cases and data from web traffic analytics…

* First up, the cases. Gizmodo published a photo (above) of what appears to be part listings for a Griffin case that’s compatible with Apple’s new tablet. But instead of calling it the iPad 3, the slate is clearly listed as the iPad HD. Interesting.
* Even though Griffin is a prominent accessory maker for Apple products, we’re not sure it would get advance notice of an upcoming unannounced product. Specifically for this reason.

* Now onto the web analytics. Aside from the part listings, the site also posted a photo of a graph showing the recent web traffic for the website iDevice.ro. Apparently, a device labeled iPad HD has been visiting the site periodically over the last several months. While there’s no way to confirm its legitimacy, the data does add a bit of weight to the theory.
* Even with the above “evidence,” we’re still not convinced that Apple has named its next tablet the iPad HD. Sure, the moniker would match up well with the device’s rumored high-resolution display. But it would also go against Apple’s previous nomenclature pattern.
* What do you think? What has Apple named its next tablet?
