* Twitter’s Vine has seen little action over the past few weeks, especially in light of Instagram Video and with a bunch of startups vying for our attention in the short video-sharing space.
* That’s not saying Vine has peaked – quite the contrary. Although I don’t share vines as much as I used to, I find myself firing up the app every other day to enjoy some of the truly stupendous or just downright hilarious clips.
* According to the latest Twitter-provided data, the Vine community is now home to some forty million people. Even though that’s a respectable figure by any measure, it fails to impress in today’s connected world where a service without at least a hundred million users is largely viewed as a failure…
* Twitter announced the milestone in a tweet.
* We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: this community – now more than 40 million of you – is amazing. Thank you for inspiring us.

* Thanks for reminding me that Vine still exists, Twitter!
* The figure represents a marked improvement over just thirteen million Vine users as of June 3 but as AllThingsD correctly points out that’s 40 million registered users rather than monthly active users.
* “Who knows how many folks dropped off the platform in the interim, especially since Instagram launched its video feature on June 20,” writer Mike Isaac observes.
* The seemingly exponential increase of the Vine community since June’s 13 million milestone could be contributed to the app’s availability on Google’s Android platform, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of smartphones out there.
* Twitter has been adding new Vine features on a more or less regular basis, even more so after Vine shares on Twitter dropped following Facebook’s release of video on Instagram.

* The last major Vine update, dating back to early-July, brought us new channels, the ability to re-share vines and post privately and more. To get the most out of Vine, I suggest Jeff’s excellent video how-to on downloading Vine videos directly to your iPhone’s Camera Roll.
* Bold prediction: live video effects coming to Vine in 3, 2, 1…

* Folks on Windows Phone, do check out a nice Vine client with the upload feature.
* What about you?
* Do you use Vine much and would you agree that Vine has inspired some wild creativity and paved the way to a bunch of pretty incredible rising stars?
