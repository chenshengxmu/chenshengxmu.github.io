* Apple is allegedly working on a major redesign for its iBooks app for iPhone and iPad and iBooks Store, bringing a few new features like a Reading Now section, audiobooks and more.
* Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman on Thursday reported on the upcoming iBooks revamp.
* With help from an ex-Amazon executive whom Apple hired back in December, they’re reportedly looking to completely redesign iBooks with a simplified interface and an updated book store.
* The app, which is currently in testing, includes a dedicated tab for audiobooks, as well as a brand new Reading Now section.
* Apple hopes to reposition itself to better compete once more against Amazon, who has continued to be the leader in sales of digital books. Currently, Amazon controls 83% of the US e-book market as of early 2017, with that number continuing to rise.
* Since Apple and publishers lost the massive $450 million lawsuit from the US Department of Justice, we haven’t heard much in the way of iBooks.
* The effort is led by Kashif Zafar, who was previously a senior vice president at Amazon-owned Audible. The app may be rebranded as “Books,” the report added.

* With iOS 11.3, Apple is dropping the “i” from iBooks.
* Indeed, we recently saw in the initial iOS 11.3 beta that Apple dropped the “i” from iBooks following a new strategy it’s taken with new products and services. Apple Music, HomePod and Apple Watch all neglected to include the iconic character Apple used to be known for.
* Are you looking forward to a new version of iBooks?
* Let us know in the comments.
