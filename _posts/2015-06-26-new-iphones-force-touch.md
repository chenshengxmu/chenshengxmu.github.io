* Apple has begun early production of new iPhone models with a feature called Force Touch, Bloomberg reports. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says that volume manufacturing is expected to ramp up as soon as next month.
* Force Touch was first introduced in the Apple Watch last fall, and it enables a device to sense how hard users press down on its screen. The technology has since made its way into the MacBook, and has long been rumored for the next iPhone.
* Bloomberg says that Apple is once again producing two different versions of its next-generation handset: one with a 4.7-inch display, and one at 5.5-inches. Unsurprisingly, the new smartphones are expected to look similar to the current models.
* It’s believed that Apple will unveil its new iPhones in or around the month of September, as it has in years past. Other rumored features for the handsets include much improved rear and FaceTime cameras, and stronger Series 7000 aluminum.
