* Hot on the heels of last week’s update that brought out official integration with Apple’s iPad Pro and support for pressure-drawing with the Apple Pencil and 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s, Pixelmator for iOS today received another update which expands Apple Pencil’s Tilt feature to an additional 30 brushes.
* Pixelmator 2.2.1 for iOS also sports faster Distort tools and includes several fixes that improve the experience.
* Developers claim that applying multiple effects to large images in Pixelmator’s Photos Extension on iOS now works without a hiccup. The app should be more stable when opening images and owners of the iPad Pro will appreciate a high-resolution icon that looks crisp on the tablet’s display.
* Speaking of the iPad Pro, Pixelmator includes support for up to 8K canvases for professional image editing though 8K images are also supported on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4 and sixth-generation iPod touch.
* Changelog mentions the following enhancements:
* Pixelmator supports the full range of Apple Pencil features, including palm rejection. The previous update also added a brand new Pixel brush which can be used to create attractive pixel art with little effort.
