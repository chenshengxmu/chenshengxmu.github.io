* If you don’t have an iPhone 4S, but still want to experience Siri, chances are you’ve already done so through one of a variety of existing methods.
* Since the iPhone 4S was released, numerous methods for providing Siri, or at least some form of her, have appeared for older devices.
* AssistantServer Installer is yet the latest way to do so, and the cool thing about it is that it requires minimal configuration to get it up and running at a very basic level…
* The problem with AssistantServer Installer is that it requires various 3rd party API keys to come close to rivaling the experience you’d receive on Siri proper. But if an iPhone 4S is without question out of the cards, this could be the $0.99 investment for you.
* It’s not terrible, it just comes off feeling a bit clunky after you’ve used an iPhone 4S for so long.
* Please note that AssistantServer Installer will not work on iOS 5.1, because it requires a Spire installation, and Spire is not compatible with iOS 5.1.
* If your iDevice is jailbroken and you want to give the Siri experience a shot, head over to Cydia’s MacCiti repo where you can download it today.
