* PowerDown Pro is a jailbreak tweak that adds extra options to the power down screen that appears on your iPhone after holding the sleep button. Normally, this menu contains a single option—slide to power off—but with PowerDown Pro, three additional options are put into play.
* Each of the available options—reboot, respring, safe mode, and shut down—can be accessed using swipe gestures on the red rectangle box found on the power down screen. Have a look at our video walkthrough after the jump to see how it works in action.
* Once you install PowerDown Pro, you’ll find a new panel for the tweak in the stock Settings app. PowerDown Pro’s preferences contain a kill-switch and a separate panel for rearranging or hiding the four power options.

* PowerDown Pro is a simple tweak, but it’s good looking, integrates like a native iOS feature, and it’s practical. You can find it on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99. If you decide to give it a shot, please share your thoughts about the tweak down below in the comments section.
