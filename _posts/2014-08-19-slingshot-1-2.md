* It’s been nearly two months now since Facebook rolled out its would-be Snapchat-killer, called Slingshot.
* Thus far, the software looks like it could be going the way of Poke, the social networking giant’s pathetic take on the popular ephemeral messaging software.
* Surprisingly enough, Slingshot currently enjoys a three-star rating out of five stars in the App Store.
* Besides, the app doesn’t seem to be languishing as the team released its first major update three weeks ago bringing out much-needed new features, including a My People tab and brand new reactions.
* Today, a second major update has landed on the App Store. Available to download for free, Slingshot 1.2 improves your experience by letting you jump straight to the list of shots by tapping a notification and more…
* In addition to this, Slingshot 1.2 makes it easy to see all unlocked shots grouped by person. Finally, several new sharing choices allow you to invite friends to install Slingshot via SMS, email, Facebook or Twitter.
* Here’s the full changelog:
* If you haven’t seen Slingshot in action yet, do give it a try.
* Before you can view messages friends send your way, the app requires you to “sling” a photo or a video back to them. And if you don’t have friends on Slingshot, just add a user named “rose,” the team’s resident representative, to start slinging and see for yourself why all the fuss.
* Grab Slingshot free in the App Store.
* The 11-megabyte download requires an iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 7.0 or later. The software currently lacks native iPad interface.
