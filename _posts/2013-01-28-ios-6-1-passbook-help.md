* Apple released the long-awaited iOS 6.1 firmware this morning, and the update brought about a handful of changes. iPhones and iPads now support LTE on a number of new international carriers, and Siri can now order movie tickets through Fandango.
* The new software also includes a minor change to the Passbook application. It seems Apple has restored the former “Welcome” screen in the app, making it easier for you to discover Passbook-enabled apps in the App Store…
* Originally, in iOS 6, Passbook opened with a page with a link to a Passbook-enabled apps section in the App Store. But that Welcome screen disappeared once a Passbook supported app was downloaded, making it difficult to locate the section again.
* However, as noted by MacRumors, iOS 6.1 has made the Welcome screen a permanent fixture in the app, and it can now be found in your Passbook, below your cards. Tapping the Welcome card opens up to a list of apps that use Passbook in the App Store.
* Perhaps just as interesting is the number of apps in this section now. When Apple first launched its digital wallet in September, there were only a few apps that supported it. Now, there are more than 20 listed, with popular names like Fandango and Starbucks.
* If you haven’t updated to iOS 6.1 yet, you can do so here. Don’t worry, it’s been deemed safe for jailbreakers.
