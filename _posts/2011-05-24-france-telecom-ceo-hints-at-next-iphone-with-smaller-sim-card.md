* In a recent interview, the CEO of French Telecom/Orange, Stephane Richard, dropped some hits towards a “smaller and thinner” iPhone 5 with a different SIM card design. Instead of the traditional method, Apple has apparently agreed with wireless carriers to support a smaller and more lightweight SIM for the next iPhone.
* Practically, this smaller SIM card would make the iPhone thinner. There is also the possibility that such a SIM card could work in tandem with the rumored ‘global device‘ that Apple could release this year.
* “As you probably know, Apple has been working for years on reducing the size of SIM cards because they need space in the phone. They even thought about a device without any SIM card, that is what is known as the e-SIM project. All of us told them it was a bad idea because the SIM card is a critical piece of the security and authentication process. It would be very difficult for a telco or carrier to manage the customer relationship. We are going to work with them in order to standardize a new format of SIM which takes into accout our needs with security and authentication and also is compatible with their wishes in terms of size.
* The person who saw the prototype of the new iPhone said the device was significantly lighter than the iPhone 4 and had an edge-to-edge screen that could be manipulated by touch, as well as a virtual keyboard and voice-based navigation.”
* As Apple continues to try and reduce the size of its products, one can only wonder how long it will take before we see an invisible iPhone. The iPhone 4 is already a thin and appealing device. It’s hard to imagine the next iPhone being even thinner.

* Could these new SIM cards be for the rumored ‘iPhone Nano‘ we keep hearing about? If Apple eventually introduced a cheaper and smaller iPhone (perhaps unlocked?), these new SIM cards would be perfect.
* What do you think? Do these new SIM cards hint at an iPhone Nano, or simply a smaller iPhone this fall?
