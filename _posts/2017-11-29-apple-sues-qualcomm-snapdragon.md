* Apple on Wednesday escalated its legal spat with Qualcomm.
* The Cupertino giant filed a countersuit against Qualcomm alleging that Snapdragon chips that are widely used in a number of Android handsets infringe on its own patents.
* According to Reuters, Apple’s filing mentions at least eight battery life patents that Qualcomm has allegedly violated. Some of the patents Apple owns involve ensuring each part of a chip draws only the minimum power needed, turning off parts of the CPU when they’re not needed and making sleep and wake functions work better.
* Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors that power Samsung and Google Pixel phones are specifically mentioned in the filing even though Samsung and Google were not named in Apple’s counterclaims.
* “Apple began seeking those patents years before Qualcomm began seeking the patents it asserts against Apple in this case,” the company wrote in its complaint. The iPhone maker said it is seeking unspecified damages from San Diego-based Qualcomm.
* This comes after Qualcomm back in the summer sued Apple over alleged patent infringement. The chip maker said Apple violated several patents it owns related to helping smartphones get better battery life. Apple has denied those claims, calling Qualcomm’s patents invalid.
