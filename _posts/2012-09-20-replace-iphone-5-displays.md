* With its new unibody design and metal backing, the iPhone 5 is built to be a bit more durable than its glass-backed predecessor. And it looks like it could be more repairable as well.
* According to a new report this afternoon, Apple may be providing its retail employees with the tools needed to fix broken iPhone 5 displays in-store, a stark departure from previous policy…
* iMore has the scoop:
* “iMore has learned from sources within Apple retail that broken iPhone 5 displays may soon be getting replaced in-store. This would be a change from Apple’s current iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 practice, which consisted of swapping the entire iPhone out for a new or refurbished one. Sources within Apple retail have told us that equipment used to remove the screens has started appearing in their stores.”
* The site says there’s no word yet on how much such a service would cost, or whether a person will need the $99 AppleCare+ plan to take advantage of it. Though it’d likely cost less than a new phone.
* iMore has been extremely accurate with its Apple intel over the past few months, so we’re inclined to believe the story. That, and Apple retail employees have been replacing 3G and 3Gs screens for years.
* If true, at least it will make up a bit for the fact that it’s going to be nearly impossible to replace the iPhone 5’s back with ease. Thanks to the unibody design, some of its parts are directly attached to it.
* What do you think? Good news, or it doesn’t really matter?
