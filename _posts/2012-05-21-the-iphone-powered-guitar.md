* Wondering where music technology is headed? Look no further than the gTar, by Incident. The iPhone-powered electric guitar not only puts hundreds of songs and digital effects at your finger tips, but it’ll also teach you how to play.
* Simply drop your iPhone into the gTar’s 30-pin dock, load up the accompanying app, and an array of interactive LEDs along the fretboard will guide you through your favorite songs. Playing a real instrument has never looked so easy…
* How does it work? Well instead of using pickups to amplify the sound of vibrating strings — the way most guitars work — the gTar users sensors to detect what notes the user is playing in real-time. And it relays this data back to the iPhone.
* One of the instrument’s most exciting elements is an intuitive feature called SmartPlay. This allows users to play music like a pro, regardless of how experienced they are, as it mutes out incorrectly played notes and helps them through difficult songs.
* The free gTar app will include a number of tracks — all of which will be learnable through three levels of difficulty, and a library full of digital sound effects. And Incident says that it plans to add new content to the app on a weekly basis.
* As you might have guessed, the gTar won’t come cheap. It’s expected to retail for close to $500. But, you can score one for just $350 by helping back the project on Kickstarter. It’s currently at $17,824 of its $100,000 goal with about 34 days left.
* What do you think of the gTar?
