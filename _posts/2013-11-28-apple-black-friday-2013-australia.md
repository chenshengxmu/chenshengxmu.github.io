* Just as we suspected yesterday, Apple’s Black Friday promotion may disappoint even the most ardent of fans as this year Tim Cook & Co. have opted to treat shoppers to Apple Store gift cards instead of actual discounts on products. Apple’s deals are now live on its Australian web store and we’re expecting the U.S. Apple Store to come online with the promotion later in the day. The problem with Apple’s gift card-only approach is that these things are redeemable against future purchases only.
* As a result, eager shoppers who are on the lookout for real discounts on products, right there and then, will instead need to visit their retail or online Apple Store again in order to actually spend their credit…
* “Today only, get an Apple Store Gift Card when you buy any of the great gifts below,” writes the Australian Apple Store. “Shop online and get fast, free shipping. Or visit your favourite Apple Retail Store”.
* The one-day shopping event offers an Apple Store Gift Card for AUS$75 (about USD$69) on iPad Air purchases, AUS$150 (approximately USD$139) on Macs, AUS$50 on iPod touch (works out to about USD$46), AUS$50 on iPad mini and iPad 2 purchases, AUS$25 (about USD$23) on iPod nano and Apple TV devices and AUS$50 on select accessories.
* It’s interesting that the iPad mini with Retina display won’t net you a gift card, which could easily indicate constrained supplies.
* The fine print reads (emphasis mine):
* The Apple Store Gift Card promotion is available only for purchases made from 12:01 am on 29 November 2013 to 11:59 pm on 29 November 2013 AEDT at Apple Retail Stores and the Apple Online Store. This promotion is available to end-users only and is not available to distributors, dealers or resellers.
* Apple reserves the right to change or cancel this promotion at any time. Pricing includes GST. This promotion is valid while supplies last; substitutions and rain checks are not allowed. This promotion cannot be combined with other offers.
* The Apple Store Gift Card may only be used for future purchases at Apple Retail Stores and the Apple Online Store. The Apple Store Gift Card is subject to additional terms and conditions.
* Again, rather than being permitted to redeem these gift cards at the time of purchase, you are required to do so solely at a later date.
* Grateful this #Thanksgiving for amazing customers and the privilege to work with fantastic people. Happy Thanksgiving!

* Happy Gift Card to you, too, Tim!
* Disappointed that stingy Apple won’t offer deep Black Friday discounts?
* Shop elsewhere, problem solved!
