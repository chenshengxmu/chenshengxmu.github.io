* An upcoming iOS 5 feature has been leaked in iTunes. Following the rumor that iOS 5 would offer over-the-air downloads for iOS updates, MacRumors has uncovered a new Apple feature called “Automatic Download.”
* Currently, users have to manually update App Store apps. You can update one app at a time, or update all apps at once in the App Store app. Automatic Download would allow for OTA downloading and syncing of app updates in iOS…
* “It also suggests that there is an Automatic Download setting for other items besides apps. Apple has been rumored to be making a push into over-the-air updates as well as some sort of wireless syncing.”

* WWDC starts Monday, and Steve Jobs will be unveiling iOS 5 and iCloud. Apple is clearly aiming at making their platforms as ‘wireless’ as possible, and this uncovering shows one more feature coming to iOS 5.
* The above iTunes leak is definitely legit, because the App Store went down for a short time after this leak was uncovered by MacRumors. Now, the message has been removed.
* If you read sites like iDB, you probably update your apps much more frequently than most consumers. How do you feel about this feature coming in iOS 5?
