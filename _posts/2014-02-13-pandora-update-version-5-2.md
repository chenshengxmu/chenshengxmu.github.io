* Pandora Radio users will be happy to hear that the streaming music service has just posted an update for its iOS client, bringing the app to version 5.2. The update brings about several enhancements, including two new features for the iPhone and iPad.
* On the iPad front, Pandora has made its Sleep Timer feature universal. So tablet users can now fall asleep to their favorite tunes without worrying about all-night data usage. And for all devices, it has added new a personalized push notification feature…
* Here are the release notes for version 5.2:
* If you love the Sleep Timer for your iPhone or iPod, you’ll be happy to know it is now available for iPad • Dream away to the sounds of your favorite station • Adjust the countdown time from 15, 30 or 60 minutes
* Opt-in to Push Notifications on your iPhone, iPod or iPad to get personalized updates • Hear about new music or comedy added to your stations • Find out your friends’ activities including follows and comments on your Pandora profile
* The usual improvements and bug fixes to keep bringing you the best listening experience
* The push notifications sound like a cool addition, as it’s nice to know when new content has been added. It’d also be nice to know as soon as someone leaves a comment on your profile, instead of letting it sit there for days between your app or profile activity.
* Pandora has been working to improve its app in the face of stiff competition from Beats Music and others. Last fall it added an Alarm Clock feature to its iPhone client, and it’s currently working on new station recommendation and discovery features.
* If you’re interested, you can grab the Pandora app from the App Store for free. The Radio part is free, with ads, and a Pandora One paid subscription plan runs $3.99 per month.
