* We don’t know if they’re real or not, but a number of cases supposedly made for the next iPhone have surfaced online in the past few weeks. It seems like they are all based on the ‘iPhone 6’ schematic drawing published last month, depicting a thin handset with rounded corners and a large display.
* Today we get a better idea of the purported device’s size thanks to a new comparison video by Unbox Therapy. The clip shows how one of these iPhone 6 cases stacks up against other popular smartphones—including the iPhone 5s, Nexus 5 and the Galaxy Note 3—in terms of various measurements…
* Here’s the clip, again from Unbox Therapy:
* This is a quick look at what looks like the first 3rd party case for the upcoming iPhone 6 – 4.7-inch (may also come in 5.5-inch variant). This video also compares the speculative iPhone 6 4.7-inch against some popular devices that are already on the market including the iPhone 5s, Nexus 5 and Galaxy Note 3. 
* The video serves its purpose, giving us a good idea of how big this alleged iPhone 6 is It seems closest in size to the Nexus 5, as it’s quite a bit bigger than the iPhone 5s, but still substantially smaller than the Galaxy Note 3. For reference, the Nexus has a 4.95-inch display, and the Note is 5.95-inches.
* The case used in the comparison matches up with others we’ve seen. You can see the Sleep/Wake button has been moved from the top right of the handset to the right side, the two circular volume buttons have been replaced with an elongated rocker switch, and the body features a rounded, iPad-like design.

* The consensus is that the iPhone 6 will be noticeably thinner than the current generation—between 6.5-7.0mm—with smaller bezels, and come in two flavors: a 4.7-inch model and a 5.5-inch model. It’s also believed to feature an A8 processor, various new sensors, an improved camera, and a larger battery.
* Apple is expected to begin mass production of the new smartphone next month, ahead of what’s believed to be a September launch. There have been multiple reports, though, calling for the 5.5-inch version to be delayed several months due to manufacturing issues involving the company’s in-cell display tech.
