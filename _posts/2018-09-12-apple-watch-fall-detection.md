* Apple COO Jeff Williams is on stage right now at the company’s big Gather Round event talking about the new Apple Watch. Among the wearable’s new features is the ability to detect if the person wearing it has fallen, and if need be connect them to emergency services.
* As Williams explains it, once the Watch has detected a fall, the user will be prompted with a screen that allows them to immediately contact the authorities. If no action is taken, the Watch will automatically notify emergency services, as well as the user’s emergency contacts.
* I know there are already products out there that offer a similar function, but built into a connected device like the Apple Watch is a game-changer. There is a clear focus on fitness and health with the new Watch, which also includes a built-in, FDA-approved ECG monitor.
