* The endless snowboarding game Alto’s Odyssey was supposed to hit iPhone, iPad and Apple TV on Thursday, February 22, but Canadian developer Snowman has decided to release this highly anticipated sequel to Alto’s Adventure a day early.
* Available as a universal download for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, Alto’s Odyssey is the official sequel to Snowman’s award-winning serene snowboarding odyssey, Alto’s Adventure.
* Alto’s Odyssey, as I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, is an endless sandboarding journey set against a gorgeous and ever-changing desert landscape and designed to be enjoyed by returning players and newcomers alike as a standalone experience all its own.

* Featuring no in-game advertising or In-App Purchases whatsoever, this premium release from Snowman is set in a fantastical place far from Alto’s home village—a majestic desert, vast and unexplored—with Alto and his friends challenged to discover its secrets.

* This is still an Alto game, meaning you can expect to traverse thrilling canyons, soar above windswept dunes, explore long-hidden temple cities, bounce atop hot air balloons and walls and so forth. Along the way, you’ll grind across vines, ride towering rock walls and escape mischievous lemurs (similar to the “elders” in the original game).

* There’s a Zen mode for when you want to explore the scenery without any coins or power-ups to pick up, as well as a Photo mode for taking screenshots of any particular moment from your sandboarding session. Like before, the scoring system in Alto’s Odyssey will have you unlock additional characters over time, each with their own unique abilities.

* Of course, you’ll be collecting coins along the way that you can use to purchase additional power-ups, some of which will be familiar to fans of the original game but many are new.
* The Odyssey features fluid physics-based movement, procedurally generated terrain and dynamic lighting and weather effects with some truly wonderful color palette changes.
