* Enterprise software giant IBM on Monday announced three new apps in its MobileFirst for iOS lineup, aimed at travel and transportation, retail and banking and financial services industries.
* The three new apps join the original software lineup targeted to customers in banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, energy and utilities, governments and airlines.
* “Apple and IBM are the only companies that could partner to develop a new category of made-for-business apps that is truly transforming how work gets done,” said Fred Balboni, IBM General Manager, IBM and Apple partnership.
* Advisor Alerts, pictured top of post, makes it easy for financial pros to properly address individual client needs. Using detailed analytics, the app helps them prioritize clients.
* And using a personalized dashboard, users can access recommended next steps, portfolio-impacting alerts and use a communications platform to quickly delegate tasks to teams back in the office.

* Dynamic Buy, seen above, gives retailers real-time perspective and data-driven recommendations on how products are performing, including seasonal recommendations.
* Lastly, the Passenger Care app (shown below) untangles travel service agents from their counters. With this app, customer service agents can address travelers’ needs on the spot with such features as personalized experience, faster check-in and more.

* IBM launched the first batch of enterprise ‘IBM MobileFirst’ app for the iPhone and iPad in mid-December 2014.
* “We set out to transform how millions of workers consume, process and use information when they are outside the four walls of the office,” said Balboni.
* “Our goal is to boost the performance of every enterprise by making all its data and processes available to any employee with an iOS device – anytime, anywhere.”
* Apple and IBM announced their broad mobile enterprise initiative last summer.
* The exclusive partnership utilizes the market-leading strengths of each company to bring about a whole new class of business apps to the iPhone and iPad.
