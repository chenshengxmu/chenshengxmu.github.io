* Although Apple’s fourth-generation Apple TV was designed to just work, there are always going to be instances when a misbehaving app will need to be purged from the memory. And with the device’s ability to download third-party apps and games, more things can now go wrong than ever before.
* Just like your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac, your Apple TV also lets you easily close a running app in order to free up system resources. In this tutorial, we’re going to show you how you can force-quit any app on the Apple TV 4 using your Siri Remote.
* Step 1: Press the Home button on the remote to return to the Apple TV’s Home screen.
* Step 2: Now double press the Home button to invoke the app switcher.

* Step 3: Highlight an app by swiping left and right on the remote’s Touch surface.
* Step 4: Swipe up on the Touch surface to force-quit the selected app.
* Step 5: To exit the app switcher and return to the Home screen, simply press the Home button on the remote.
