* Now that the new Apple TV’s operating system has become a true software platform in its own right—joining iOS, OS X and watchOS—Apple can more easily than before add new features to the experience by way of software updates.
* Like its predecessor, the fourth-generation Apple TV will put up a message when a software update is available. Sometimes, the notification may get delayed, or not show up at all.
* Should this happen to you, you will need to check for updates manually and this tutorial will teach you how to do just that.
* Step 1: To check for updates, go to Settings → System → Software Updates and select Check for Update. If an update is available, a message will appear. You can then choose Download and Install to start downloading.
* Tip: To set your Apple TV to automatically apply software updates, go to Settings → System → Software Updates and select Update Automatically.
* Step 1: Go to Settings → General → Update Software and select Update Software. The device checks for an available update. If one is available, a download message should appear. Choose Download and Install to start the update process.
* Tip: To set the device to automatically download and install a software update as soon as one becomes available, go to Settings → General → Software Updates and choose Update Automatically.
* By the way, folks using a third-party controller with their Apple TV will use the D-pad to select an item and press the A button to select it.
* When you choose to apply the software update, your Apple TV initiates a background download. It’s important to avoid disconnecting the device during the update process.
* The Apple TV will automatically restart as part of the software update process and its status light may flash slowly during the update (this is normal behavior).
