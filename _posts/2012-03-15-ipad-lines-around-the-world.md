* If you were thinking that the new iPad‘s lack of a redesigned body or quad-core CPU was going to affect customer demand, think again. In typical pre-launch fashion, lines are forming around the world for Apple’s new tablet.
* Although most retailers won’t be opening their doors until 8am tomorrow morning, some stores have announced that they will start selling the new iPad as early as 12:01 EST here in the States…
* As noted by MacStories, lines have started to form in front of Apple Stores and other chains around the world. The site has a pretty nice gallery going of iPad line photos, and it looks like most places are packed.

* Our buddy Craig Fox (see above), who is heading up the 2012 JailbreakCon project, sent us a photo of the line at the Regent Street Apple Store in London. He says there appears to be roughly 30-40 people around him.
* Initially, the new iPad will be launching in 10 countries including the US, Canada, UK, Germany and Hong Kong. That’s a pretty big deal considering the iPad 2 was only available in the US on opening day last year.
* What do the lines look like in your area?
