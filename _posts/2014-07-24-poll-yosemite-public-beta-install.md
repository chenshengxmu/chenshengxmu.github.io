* As promised, Apple today opened up OS X 10.10 Yosemite betas to the first million applicants who’ve signed up for the OS X Beta Program using their Apple ID. If you haven’t yet signed up for the program, better hurry up! Otherwise, be patient as Apple will email you soon (using your Apple ID contact details) to let you know when your OS X Yosemite Beta redemption code is ready.
* There’s a lot to love about Yosemite – both in terms of the simplified, flattened user interface and  new features that take integration between iOS and the Mac to the next level.
* It also marks the first time Apple has permitted both its registered Mac developers and the general public to access betas of a work-in-progress Mac operating system update.
* Today’s poll asks a very simple question: are you, or are you not, going to install the public Yosemite beta on your Mac?
* To create a dual-boot configuration, follow Jeff’s excellent tutorial on installing OS X Yosemite Beta on a partition of its own.
* Your Mac must meet the following requirements for Yosemite betas:
* You’ll be installing the current build 14A299l, virtually the same version Apple releases to developers earlier in the week. I’m saying “virtually” because Yosemite public beta is one build newer than the fourth beta released to developers.
* Cast your vote below and join us in comments.
* Known issues include:
* One more thing: unless you also happen to run iOS 8, some of the coolest Yosemite features won’t work such as Handoff, the ability to make and take phone calls via FaceTime on your Mac, SMS in the Messages app, AirDrop between Yosemite and iOS 8, Instant Hotspot and iCloud Drive.

* On first-run, Yosemite will offer to migrate your iCloud Documents & Data to the upcoming iCloud Drive. Keep in mind that migrating to iCloud Drive will make your documents stored in iCloud Drive sync only between Macs running the OS X Yosemite beta and iPhones, iPads and iPods running iOS 8.
* Folks who’ve opted to stay on iCloud will continue to enjoy seamless data sync across all devices and operating system. Those still on the fence of deploying Yosemite on their work/home machine should check out the ten things you should know before jumping in on the action with the public Yosemite beta.
