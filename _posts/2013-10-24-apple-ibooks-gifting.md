* Unlike other media Apple sells, such as music and video, you’ve not been able to gift e-books – until now (perhaps). As we head into the holiday season, the iPhone maker has filed for a patent on sending to friends the e-books you’ve already purchased through the iBookstore. The patent filing would enable you to select a passage in an e-book that reminds you of someone, then gift the book, complete with a personalize message…
* The 2012 patent application, titled “Personalizing digital gifts”, describes how “a user can select the appealing e-book snippet, which will bring up a contextual menu containing an option to gift the media to another party,” writes AppleInsider.
* Along with the e-book, an iBooks gift can be personalized, including the portion which reminded the giver of the recipient, as well as a note, bookmarks or even a highlighted passage.
* This isn’t Apple’s first foray into gifting.
* The tech giant recently explored ways to transfer digital media between iDevices, using NFC technology. The company has also patented a way to loan purchased iTunes material to others.
* Apple’s working on gifting follows the firm’s antitrust conviction regarding e-book contracts for the iBookstore. As part of the settlement, the company now has a government-appointed babysitter to watch over future sales.
* Interestingly enough, even though users can gift music, iOS and Mac applications and other content sold on iTunes to others, but gifting of iBooks is conspicuously absent from iTunes.
* As you can see above, clicking on the down arrow next to the Buy button doesn’t produce the gifting option.
* Talk about narrowing you potential market.
