* As expected, one of the stars of Apple’s iPhone event yesterday was its new Siri feature. The project, which the rumor mill dubbed Assistant, materialized on stage as a digital personal assistant for future iPhone users.
* Even with its impressive demo yesterday, many folks have written Siri off as another failed attempt at a voice command feature. TUAW did some digging and found some evidence that it’s much, much more than that…
* Whether the hardware on Apple’s latest handset is a disappointment or not is a conversation for another time. But the fact that some folks believe that Siri can be lumped in with other voice command offerings is absolutely absurd.
* The folks over at TUAW have gotten ahold of a list of example phrases that you will be able to use with Apple’s new Siri feature. Here is a small excerpt:
* Address Book
* Querying Contacts
* Finding Contacts
* Relationships
* Calendars
* Adding Events
* Changing events
* Asking about events
* Alarms
* Setting Alarms
* Checking the Clock
* Using a Timer
* Email
* Sending Messages
* Check email
* Responding to Messages
* And that’s just a small sample. You can get the full list here (it’s huge). Also keep in mind that these are just “examples” of phrases that you can say to Siri. It can understand hundreds of other commands.
* Perhaps the most important thing about Siri is its ability to accurately comprehend common language. The folks that went hands-on with the iPhone 4S yesterday were blown away by how spot-on its voice recognition was.
* I don’t know about you guys, but this seems leaps and bounds ahead of the competition in terms of voice command features. And oh yeah, Apple is still referring to Siri as being in Beta, so the service can only get better from here.
* What’s your take on Apple’s new Siri feature?
