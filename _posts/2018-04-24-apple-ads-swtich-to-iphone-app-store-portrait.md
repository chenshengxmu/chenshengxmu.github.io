* Apple’s “Switch to iPhone” campaign continues with a pair of 15-second ads.
* Titled “App Store” and “Portraits,” these nicely down new commercials are targeted at Android switchers as global smartphone demand cools off, forcing companies like Apple and Samsung to devise devise ways of luring customers from competitors.
* The ad about portraiture photography modes available on iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X invites would-be switchers to take studio-quality portraits but without the studio.
*  
* The videos finish with the tagline “Life’s easier on iPhone.”
* I like the App Store one better as it highlights crucial differences between Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store: app quality, curation and the fact that Apple customers get world-class support from a real person at an Apple store, on the phone or online.
* How do you like these new videos from Apple?
