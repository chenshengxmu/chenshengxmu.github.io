* The 60-second video, titled “Taxi Driver” and sporting the marquee iPhone X feature, Animoji, uses the popular South Korean indie band HYUKOH’s new single, titled “Citizen Kane.”
* Interestingly enough, the band’s single was officially released yesterday on Apple Music ahead of its global roll-out on physical media by the end of this month.
* Give the ad a quick watch right now.
* Song: “Citizen Kane” by HYUKOH
* HYUKOH were formed in May 2014 and consist of leader singer and guitarist Oh Hyuk, bassist Im Dong-geon, guitarist Lim Hyun-jae and dummer Lee In-woo. The band is signed to DRDRamc and HIGHGRND.
* Needless to say, this isn’t the first musical ad from Apple featuring Animoji.
* Earlier in the year, the Cupertino firm released a pretty trippy Animoji-focused advertisement ahead of the Grammy Awards with music by Migos and Childish Gambino, and then another one ahead of the BRIT music awards in the United Kingdom.
* I’ve embedded both spots right below for your viewing pleasure.

* As for today’s video from Apple Korea, it features a pair of the company’s latest Animoji characters: a bear and a dragon. To quickly refresh your memory, the iOS 11.3 software update brought four new Animoji characters—a lion, dragon, bear and skull.
