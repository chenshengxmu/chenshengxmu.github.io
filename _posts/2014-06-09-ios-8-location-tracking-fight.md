* In a move designed to appease privacy watchers and further protect your privacy, Apple has made it that much harder for pesky marketeers to identify your device (and consequentially you as a user) or track your location as you go about your business. As discovered by Swiss programmer Frederic Jacobs, iOS 8 randomizes your device’s MAC address while scanning for networks.
* A MAC address serves as a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. By randomizing your device’s MAC address each time it scans for nearby Wi-Fi hotspots, iOS 8 effectively disguises any trace of the real device. Here’s hoping this becomes an industry standard. Jump past the fold to learn more about this nifty feature…
* Jacobs shared an image on Twitter – basically a slide from Apple’s WWDC 2014 videos – outlining the new feature.
* You’d be surprised how aggressively certain companies harvest MAC addresses for marketing and other purposes. In fact, there’s a whole industry built on MAC data collection.
* A story by The New York Times highlights a company called Euclid Analytics, whose primary reason of existence is to log MAC addresses of devices in the vicinity of Wi-Fi zones in shopping malls, in order to learn about the various patterns of shoppers and sell that intelligence to third-parties.
* Another startup has even dared install trash bins at London’s most trafficked location in order to collect the MAC addresses from passers-by, as reported by ArsTechnica.
* I mean, how crazy is that?
* The problem is, these controversial methods could be viewed as an aggressive violation of user privacy because that’s exactly what they are – privacy intrusions that shouldn’t be tolerated.
* With this in mind, I’m really glad Apple has acted to make it harder for marketeers to track our location and identify our devices.
* Sweet, no?
* This is bound to cause havoc for mobile trackers and that can only be a good thing.
