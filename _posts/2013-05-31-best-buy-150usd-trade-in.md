* In another sign that Best Buy could be clearing stock (or simply enticing customers to pick up an Apple handset), CNET reports the retailer will trade-in your working iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S on Sunday for a $150 credit, which can be redeemed against the purchase of a new iPhone. Given that Best Buy normally sells the entry-level iPhone 5 on a two-year contract for $150, the promotion lets you trade-in your old iPhone and purchase Apple’s latest and greatest handset without paying a dime – of course, excluding the obligatory carrier activation fee and any applicable sales tax…
* According to CNET, you must be eligible for an upgrade and activate your iPhone 5 on a two-year contract with Verizon, AT&T or Sprint to take advantage of the offer.
* The deal wasn’t available online at post time.
* As Dan DeSilva points out over at 9to5Mac, it may not be your best bet as other places offer even deeper discounts. For example, Gazelle will pay $215 for your 64GB AT&T iPhone 4S in good condition, $75 more compared to Best Buy.
* And in some cases, DeSilva notes, “Amazon will pay upwards of $300 for an iPhone 4S”.
* Best Buy, an important Apple distributor, recently partnered with Samsung on so-called Experience Shops, basically the store-within-a-store concept rolling out to 1,400 Best Buy locations.
* Last week, AllThingsD reported that Best Buy is shaving $50 off every iPhone sold through June 29.
