* Lightning-flavored accessories were fairly scarce in the first few months following Apple’s September iPhone 5 launch. But over the past few weeks, we’ve started seeing more of them surface.
* The latest batch of supplements comes from Griffin. The third-party manufacturer announced yesterday that it would be launching a handful of new Lightning-to-USB cables next week…
* From Griffin’s press release (via MacRumors)
* “Griffin’s new cables with Lightning Connector are affordable charging solutions that are built to resist kinks and tangles. The cables work perfectly with Griffin’s family of PowerBlocks and PowerJolts as well as Apple’s USB power adapters, or plug into a computer’s USB to sync with iTunes.”
* The cables will come in 2, 3 and 4 foot (coiled) lengths, priced at $16.99, $18.99 and $24.99 respectively. There will also be an extra-long 9.8 foot USB-to-Lightning cable option, which will run $29.99.
* Griffin doesn’t give an exact launch date for the accessories. But if you’re interested, you’ll be able to find the new Lightning cables in its web store sometime during the first week of December.
