* NotiAction is an innovative new jailbreak tweak that does something particularly cool—it lets you launch any Activator action by means of keywords found in incoming iOS notifications. You can designate up to 10 keywords with wildcards in the tweak’s settings, and allow NotiAction to listen for those particular keywords. If a valid keyword is found, then the corresponding Activator action is automatically launched. Have a look at our video walkthrough for a demonstration of NotiAction.
* After installing NotiAction, you’ll need to open the Settings app and scroll down until you find the tweak’s preference panel. Once you do, open the panel, and you’ll see two switches at the top of the tweak’s preferences.
* The first switch is a basic kill-switch, and the second switch enables and disables case sensitivity. Beneath these two switches, you’ll find a group of ten different notification filters that the tweak will check for. In these filter boxes, you’ll want to insert the keyword that you wish NotiAction to key on.
* You can also use a wildcard character in the notification filter boxes, but keep in mind that notifications must match the entire filter. Once you’ve configured the filters to your liking, you’ll need to respring your iPhone using the respring shortcut at the bottom of NotiAction’s preference panel.

* After respringing, open Activator’s preferences, and find the NotiAction Events section. There, you’ll see all 10 NotiAction matches, which correspond to each of the respective filters in NotiAction’s preferences.
* In the video demonstration of the tweak embedded above, I assigned the word “wow” to the first NotiAction filter, and assigned the match in Activator’s preferences to launch the Calculator app. Once I received a notification containing the word “wow”, the Calculator app automatically launched without me lifting a finger.
* I’m interested to see what types of scenarios that users will come up with when it comes to utilizing NotiAction and its keyword based action launching. It’s an impressive tweak that has lots of potential, can be acquired free of charge from the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think about NotiAction?
