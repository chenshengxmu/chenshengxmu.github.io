* After months of waiting, premium accessory maker Twelve South has finally introduced its BookBook vintage case series for the iPad Air. Like the BookBook for the iPhone 5/5s, BookBook for the iPad mini [review] and full-size iPad, BookBook for the MacBook Air and other BookBook cases, the iPad Air edition is hand-distressed using high-quality leather to give each one a slightly different appearance.
* It’s also a nice theft-deterrent thanks to its dusty tome appearance hiding your iPad Air completely from prying eyes while keeping it protected from elements, dust, nicks and scratches. And like other BookBook cases, it allows you to prop up your device at a 30-degree angle for prolonged text entry and showing off your media. ..
* The BookBook for iPad Air features a soft, microfiber interior that protects your iPad Air’s finish, two hardback covers with reinforced corners for impact protection and dual zippers that can be unzipped just enough to connect the charging cord or a headphone cable without having to remove the device from the case.
* I love that it looks like a spell book!

* Twelve South writes:
* Our latest BookBook is hand-tailored exclusively to fit and protect iPad Air. BookBook for iPad Air has the same great features you’ve come to expect in this novel case, including a built-in display and typing stand, wrapped in a distressed leather exterior.
* The case is available in Classic Black and Vintage Brown.

* Unfortunately, the awesome Vibrant Red edition which was available for the fourth-generation iPad won’t be available for the iPad Air because that styling, according to Twelve South’s Facebook page, has been discontinued.
* The case is 10.2 inches (259mm) wide, 7.4 inches (188mm) tall, 0.78 inches (20mm) deep and weighs in at 11.6 ounces, or 328 grams.
* Twelve South is taking orders for the $79.99 case via its webstore.
* Folks who’d rather prefer something different should consider Twelve South’s SurfacePad series, available for the iPad mini, the iPhone 5/5s/5c [review] and the iPhone 4/4s. Its biggest selling point: the SurfacePad removes the need for the typical shell because the cover itself adheres to the device using the same type of adhesive Twelve South used with the SurfacePad for iPhone.
* If you’ve been wondering, it leaves no residue and can be removed and replaced multiple times. An iPad Air edition of the SurfacePad is scheduled to arrive in late-Spring.
