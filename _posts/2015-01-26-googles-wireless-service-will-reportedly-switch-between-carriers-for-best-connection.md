* The Wall Street Journal reports Google’s upcoming and rumored wireless service won’t rely on one single carrier, and instead will switch between networks to give customers the best wireless signal.
* The service will feature new technology that would hunt through cellular connections provided by Sprint and T-Mobile and Wi-Fi hotspots, picking whichever offers the best signal to route calls, texts and data, the newspaper’s sources said. 
* The service is said to launch nationwide as early as the first half of 2015. It’s said not to be based on aggressive pricing, but that you’ll be able to get a more reliable connection at all times. The Wall Street Journal says Google’s aim is to get the best and fastest wireless connection without users having to worry about a long-term relationship with a carrier.
* The Information, who has a solid track record reporting on Google, was the first to bring word of a Google wireless service last week.
* Google had previously been testing a wireless network at its Mountain View headquarters as early as 2013. Some of the details on this wireless network come from an application the Google submitted to the FCC asking for an experimental license to create what the application called an “experimental radio service.” The application asked for approval to operate a network with a two-mile radius covering its headquarters.
