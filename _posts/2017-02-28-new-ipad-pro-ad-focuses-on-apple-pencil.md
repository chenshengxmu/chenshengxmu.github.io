* Reminiscent of Apple’s legendary “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” commercials, the latest iPad Pro ad campaign based on real tweets from real people continues with a new 16-second video posted to the company’s YouTube channel Tuesday.
* Titled “No More Printing,” the video is based on a 2013 tweet which reads: “When you’re printing personal things at work and you have to run to the printer to get your stuff before anyone else does.”
* The commercial shows off iPad Pro’s ability to sign digital documents right on the device with Apple Pencil. “You wouldn’t have to print anymore, if your computer was an iPad Pro,” Apple wrote in the video’s description.
* And here it is.
* Do you like this new iPad Pro ad better than the previous ones?
