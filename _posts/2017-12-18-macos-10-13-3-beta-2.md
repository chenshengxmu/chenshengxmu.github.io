* Apple on Monday launched the second beta of macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 to developers. The build number is 17D25b, and the update can be installed by registered developers using the Mac App Store’s update mechanism.
* The macOS 10.13.3 beta comes hot on the heels of the public launch of 10.13.2, which contained few user-facing changes. It’s believed that 10.13.3 is also going to be a minimal update, with a focus on under-the-hood improvements.
* We’re installing beta 2 and we’ll be sure to report back if anything of note is discovered. And as always, if you see something significant we’ve missed, be sure to let us know about it down in the comments below.
