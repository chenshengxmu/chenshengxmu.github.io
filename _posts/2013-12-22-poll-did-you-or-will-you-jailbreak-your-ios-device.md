* Like several of our commenters joked about, today’s release of evasi0n7 could be summed up by this quote by Steve Jobs, relating the stolen iPhone 4 episode.
* “So this is a story that’s amazing. It’s got theft, it’s got buying stolen property, it’s got extortion, I’m sure there’s sex in there somewhere. So someone should make a movie out of this. This whole thing is very colorful.”
* All jokes aside, today was a day full of surprising events. The release of evasi0n7 itself was a surprise, especially in regards to the upcoming release of iOS 7.1. Then there was of course the suspicious addition of TaiG for Chinese users, and the long silence from the evad3rs about this all until they finally cleared the air. All this left us with the sour taste of a jailbreak that may or may not really be ready for consumption, as we summed up here.
* Now that we have all the pieces together, we’d like to find out if you have, will, or will not jailbreak your device…
* Please take the poll below and make sure to share your point of view in the comments section.
* Have you, or will you jailbreak your iOS device?
