* iPhone 7 leaks and rumors have dominated the headlines for better part of the summer, especially as we’ve been inching closer and closer to the handset’s expected September introduction. But the iPhone 7 isn’t the only Apple product that’s up for a refresh.
* The iPad Pro, which made its debut last September alongside the iPhone 6s, should see its regular annual refresh, too, and now photos sent in to AppleInsider from a Chinese supply-chain source claim to picture a second-generation iPad Pro prototype with a 12.9-inch screen.
* “The picture set, sent in to AppleInsider by an anonymous tipster on Sunday, is said to originate from within a Chinese supplier currently working on an iPad Pro model scheduled to go into production in late September,” reads the article.
* And here’s the alleged iPad Pro 2 image.

* Bearing an unknown model identification number (“MH1C2CD/F”), the images show the device running the Settings screen and having just twelve gigabytes of storage, leading the publication to speculate that the photos might depict a pre-production or prototype device. As for the software, the blurry photos reveal a build number corresponding to Apple’s latest iOS 10 beta, which was released to developers earlier this month.
* The device’s MH1C2CD/F identifier follows Apple’s convention, which applies derivatives of order number ML0G2LL/A — ML3N2LL/A for cellular models, though AppleInsider states that the identifier could have been forged.
* Assuming the photos are genuine, it doesn’t seem the iPad Air 2 has fixed Apple’s big bezel problem. Again, we cannot vouch for authenticity of these photos as these things could be easily faked. For all we know, this could be a prototype of the original iPad Pro running the new software.
* We’re expecting the next iPad Pro, both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch model, to ship with Apple’s A11 system-on-a-chip, better cameras, True Tone technology which debuted on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and other features, like 3D Touch.
