* Just spotted an interesting notice over at the online Apple Store, where Apple promises to deliver your iPad mini by Christmas if orders are placed by midnight December 5. “Order iPad mini by midnight December 5 for guaranteed delivery before Christmas”, reads Apple’s holiday shopping page.
* A lot of kids’ faces in the U.S. are gonna light up after unwrapping their Christmas gift. Over in the United Kingdom, however, shoppers must order the gadget by midnight today, or by December 4 in Canada. Apple’s also sweetening the deal with free shipping and laser engraving. Hopefully, Santa won’t say you’ve been a naughty boy…
* Now, as international online Apple Stores normally list a 2-week shipping estimate for iPad minis, there’s nothing unusual about Apple guaranteeing pre-Christmas deliveries: these deadlines leave Foxconn with just about two weeks to manufacture your unit, add a personal laser-engraved message and ship it to your doorstep.

* “Guaranteed delivery” aside, it’s nice holiday marketing and Apple’s very good at it.
* And should your iPad mini by any chance miss the Christmas delivery schedule, you’ll know who to blame, won’t you?
