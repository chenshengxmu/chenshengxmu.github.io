* Eagle-eyed readers spotted something interesting at the end of yesterday’s clip accompanying the one billionth Angry Birds download milestone: a character that looks a lot like that in Casey’s Contraptions, a charming and addictive puzzle game by Snappy Touch and Mystery Coconut.
* Confirming speculation, Rovio’s vice president of franchise development Ville Heijari confirmed his company acquired all rights to Casey’s Contraptions. The iPad version has already been pulled from the App Store as the Angry Birds maker works on a new version that will hit iOS, Android and other platforms this summer…
* Heijari confirmed the news to Gamasutra, saying “this is a game that we all fell in love with from the first play”.
* He also explained how Casey’s Contraptions fits Rovio’s DNA:
* The gameplay is a perfect fit in our arsenal with its approachable, fun and highly addictive take on the physics puzzler genre. We are currently reworking the title to enhance it, and getting ready to re-introduce it in a true ‘expect the unexpected’ Rovio style launch to an even larger audience.
* And here’s that clip.
* The new Casey’s Contraptions game will be released under the Rovio brand this summer for iOS and Android platforms, “extending to further platforms rapidly after that”.
* Headquartered in Espoo, Finland, Rovio is rumored to file for an IPO next year. The company’s stellar 2011 results matched one-sixth of the teleoperator Elisa’s profit.
* Those who played Casey’s Contraptions should easily realize that Casey’s Contraptions is destined to become a next major franchise for Rovio.
* Perhaps that’s the “something even bigger” hint the company teased last month?
* I’m looking forward to the new Casey’s Contraptions as I’m sure Rovio will apply some of its magic to the already addictive game.
* You?
