title: The best wireless chargers for your new iPhone

* As you know, all of the new iPhone models support wireless charging. The tech has been around for years in Android devices, but for folks who aren’t familiar with it, this allows you to place your phone on a compatible pad or mat to charge it—no more physically plugging your charger into your phone.
* More specifically Apple’s new handsets support the popular Qi wireless standard, meaning they’re going to be compatible with a lot of wireless charging products that are already on the market, so we thought we’d roundup the best wireless chargers for iPhone.
* The Qi standard of wireless charging uses electromagnetic induction to move power from the charger to your phone. Wireless charging accessories have induction coils that create an alternating electromagnetic field, and compatible handsets have a built-in coil that can receive that energy and convert it back into electricity to charge your device’s battery.
* There are a few caveats here. Wireless charging is typically slower than its wired counterpart, which isn’t a big deal if you typically charge overnight, but could be if you’re looking for a quick power up. It’s also common for wireless charging pads and devices to heat up while in charging—though all of the chargers we’ve listed below have built-in safety features to ensure they don’t get too hot. And finally, a lot of manufacturers recommend removing thicker cases from your phone before setting it on the wireless pad. Again this won’t affect most users, but for the few that use bulky, rugged cases, it can be an inconvenience.

* Perhaps the easiest one to recommend is the Mophie wireless charging base. It’s been optimized to charge your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X quickly and easily. Simply set your iPhone on the wireless base and charging begins immediately. The included wall adapter means you have everything you need to get charging right out of the box. Mophie adds that a software update will be released later this year to enable high-speed charging on the pad. This is one of the more expensive chargers, but Mophie has a solid track record for iPhone accessories and they clearly have Apple’s blessing here.
* Buy for $60.

* Anker’s another brand that gets a lot of praise—particularly on Amazon, where most of its products enjoy 4-star ratings or better. Their wireless charging pad features 5V/2A input, 5V/1A output, temperature control for safer and efficient charging, LED indicator lights, and more. You get the pad, a 3ft micro USB cable, and an 18-month hassle-free warranty. This isn’t the best-reviewed charger out there, but between its price and feature set, it’s worth checking out.
* Buy for $26 (sale price).

* Did someone say fast-charging? Spigen’s Essential Qi wireless charger supports QC 2.0 and 3.0 standards—up to 1.5x faster charging than regular wireless chargers (10 watt (5V/2.0A). It’s also compatible with a wide range of Qi devices and sports a very slim and subtle design. Features include LED indicators, so you know when your device is properly charging, and built-in safety components to keep your device from overheating. It’s also worth noting that the package comes with a 5-foot Micro-USB cable—slightly longer than a lot of the cables you get with wireless pads.
* Buy for $19 (sale price).

* Hitting the sweet spot between premium and pricey is the Belkin wireless charging pad. Belkin has had a lot of success in the iPhone accessory range, so much so that Apple often features their products in its retail stores. Features here include a slim, sleek design covered in soft, high-friction material to avoid scratching your device and to keep it in one place, 1-amp output for charging, LED indicator lights, and Qi-certified transmitting coils. It’s is also compatible with Qi-receiving battery shell cases for other phones that don’t feature native Qi functionality. Comes with a Belkin Micro USB Cable (4ft) and a 2 amp wall adapter, everything you need for quick setup.
* Buy for $40.

* The BOOST UP is essentially a newer and more expensive version of the above Belkin charger. In fact at the time of writing, shipping was still about a month out. Nevertheless, this one ranks right up there with the Mophie wireless charging base, thanks to its price tag and feature set. It delivers 7.5W optimal charging for the new iPhones and has a green LED indicator light, so you can easily see that your phone is correctly positioned for charging. The big deal here: Belkin says it worked closely with Apple to ensure that this charger works great with the new iPhones. You really can’t ask for a better endorsement than that, now can you?
* Buy for $60.

* Prefer a stand instead of a pad? Check out this one from Seneo. It has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon, on over 1,200 reviews, and it comes with an 18-month warranty to ensure your satisfaction. Includes all of the usual features like an LED indicator light, protection against overheating and overcharging, and a Micro USB cable for charging. Also supports QC (Quick Charging) technology, meaning it can charge compatible devices up to 1.4x faster than regular wireless chargers (although it sounds like it will only support standard charging for the new iPhones). But the big standout here is its cradle-like design that will allow you to easily see notifications at a glance and even perform tasks on the phone as it charges.
* Buy for $18 (sale price).
