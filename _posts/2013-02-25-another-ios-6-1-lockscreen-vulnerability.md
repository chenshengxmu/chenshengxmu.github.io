title: Another iOS 6.1 trick to bypass the Lock screen
---
* So what’s up with Apple and the iPhone’s Lock screen? I mean, the various Lock screen vulnerabilities have persisted in iOS since the first passcode flaw was discovered in iOS 2.0 – and that was way back in July of 2008. And now, in addition to a simple passcode bypass trick a YouTube user detailed on Valentine’s Day, another method of circumventing the Lock screen passcode has been discovered and highlighted in a video above…
* Antivirus maker Kaspersky wrote in a threat post:
* Similar to the iPhone’s passcode vulnerability, the exploit involves manipulating the phone’s screenshot function, its emergency call function and its power button.
* Users can make an emergency call (911 for example) on the phone and then cancel it while toggling the power on and off to get temporary access to the phone.
* Jacqui Cheng of Ars Technica explains the exploit, which was discovered and detailed on February 18 by Vulnerability Lab CEO Benjamin Kunz Mejri:
* The difference between the first exploit and this one is how it can make the iPhone screen go black, allowing an attacker to plug the device into a computer via USB and access the user’s data without having their PIN or passcode credentials.
* And like the first exploit, this one lets a malicious user bypass a passcode on the Lock screen and gain access to your messages, phone calls, contacts and other private data.
* You can reproduce the glitch using the following steps:
* • make sure a passcode is activated in Settings and then lock your device by pressing the Sleep/Wake button • hit the Sleep/Wake button again to wake up the device • slide to unlock • tap the Emergency Call button on a virtual keypad • dial 911, 110, 112 or any other emergency call number from a public listing and immediately hang up the call • hit the Sleep/Wake button to send the device to sleep, then wake it up and slide to unlock • hold the Sleep/Wake button pressed for three seconds and then just before the ‘slide to power off’ prompt appears tap the Emergency Call button
* As long as you keep holding the Sleep/Wake button, you will gain access to your contacts, call list, apps and more. Bear in mind that as a result of this vulnerability, an attacker can also plug your device into a computer via USB in order to gain access to even more data without knowing your passcode.
* Kaspersky’s security advisory notes that connecting a compromised device to a computer via a USB cord exposes not only the user’s photos, contacts and other PIM data because more “will be available directly from the device hard drive without the pin to access.”
* Truth be told, this is getting ridiculous – Apple’s gotta do something about these Lock screen flaws.
* We kinda hoped the iOS 6.1.2 firmware would squash these bugs, but that wasn’t the case as iOS 6.1.2 only delivered a fix for the Exchange bug that was affecting battery life. By the way, ad tracking firm Chitika today reported that less than a week after it became available for download, iOS 6.1.2 is now the most popular version.
* “Apple takes user security very seriously,” a spokeswoman for Apple recently said. “We are aware of this issue, and will deliver a fix in a future software update.”
* Four days ago, iOS 6.1.3 Beta 2 was seeded to Apple’s registered developers. In the release notes, Apple mentions that iOS 6.1.3 will also fix the Lock screen bug.
