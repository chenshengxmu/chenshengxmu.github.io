* Following their major enterprise mobility partnership which was announced this summer, Apple and IBM this morning launched the first batch of MobileFirst apps for enterprise iOS users. The new suite of business-focused apps are available exclusively for the iPhone and iPad starting today and include apps for insurance, retail, telecom, government, travel, transportation, banking and more.
* “This is a big step for iPhone and iPad in the enterprise, and we can’t wait to see the exciting new ways organizations will put iOS devices to work,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The business world has gone mobile, and Apple and IBM are bringing together the world’s best technology with the smartest data and analytics to help businesses redefine how work gets done.”
* A total of ten business-oriented iOS apps went live today, with such clients as Citi, Air Canada, Sprint and Banorte support IBM’s MobileFirst program.
* Here’s a quick rundown of the apps, courtesy of Apple:
* These enterprise apps can be managed and deployed through IBM’s cloud services. Additional apps being continuously designed and developed as we speak.
* “What we’re delivering aims directly at the new quest of business—smart technologies that unlock new value at the intersection of big data and individual engagement,” said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president, IBM Global Business Services.

* These apps look truly great and business users’ standards for user interfaces and functionality are going to increase vastly. And by raising the bar, Apple and IBM have just made it that much harder for other platforms to catch up in enterprise.
