* Do you remember that time you went out with your friends and you gave that guy/girl your phone number, but when you woke up the next day you realized that you weren’t as into that person as you were when you were looking at them through your beer goggles?
* I’ll bet you wish you could block that person from calling or texting you. Especially if that person is kind of nuts and won’t leave you alone. Starting with iOS 7, Apple has finally given us a way to stop unwanted calls by making it possible to block callers on iPhone and we are going to show you how to enable it.
* In iOS, Apple has made it possible for you to block unwanted phone calls, FaceTime calls, and messages. When enabled, you will not receive phone calls, text or messages, or FaceTime calls from the offending person. This is a great way to get rid of pushy telemarketers, finance companies that won’t get off your case, and creepy exes who still want to be your friend.
* Step 1: In the Phone app, go to Favorites or Recents tab and tap the info icon next to the name or number of the person you want to block.
* Step 2: Scroll down to the tab that reads, “Block this Caller.”
* Step 3: Tap to block the caller.
