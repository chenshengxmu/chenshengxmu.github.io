* Last week Apple gave us a sneak peek at iPhone OS 4. The presentation, which was more for developers than users, focused on 7 “tent poles” (multitasking, folders, enhanced mail, iBooks, enterprise, game center, and iAd).
* I was not particularly impressed by the new features unveiled, mostly because most of them are already here for anyone with a jailbroken iPhone. In this post, I would like to show you how you can make your old boring iPhone 3.X look a little bit more like iPhone OS 4.
* For all features listed below, there is either a jailbreak app or mod to do the job. If your iPhone is jailbroken, here is how you can give it a little taste of OS 4. If your iPhone is not jailbroken yet, then you’re missing out and you should jump on the jailbreak bandwagon!
* Multitasking: Install Backgrounder and ProSwitcher to bring multitasking to your iPhone.
* Background wallpapers: Install BossPaper or WinterBoard, which will let you customize your iPhone in every possible way. You can even download the iPhone OS 4 Theme from Cydia!
* Folders: Install Categories.
* Multiple Exchange accounts: Simply look at this hack that lets you set up multiple Exchange accounts on your iPhone.
* iBooks: Just download the free Kindle application from the App Store.
* Home screen music controls: Install the Music Controls app.
* iAd: Want more ads on your iPhone? Go to any porn site from your iPhone and you’ll get plenty of ads. Ok I’m being sarcastic…
* I can already hear the complainers complain that this is a huge stretch and that OS 4 will be much better than these jailbreak apps. Well, yes you’re right. OS 4 will probably do a better job than these jailbreak apps or tweaks, but the point of this article is to show you that Apple didn’t reinvent the wheel at all and that you don’t need to wait for this summer to get OS 4 rocking on your iPhone.
