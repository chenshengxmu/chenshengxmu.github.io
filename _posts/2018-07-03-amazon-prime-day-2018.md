* This year’s Amazon Prime Day doesn’t kick off until Monday, July 16 beginning at 12:01 p.m. PDT. But let’s be honest here, the event has already started as some deals are now online with many more coming between now and the event’s official start. 
* Amazon Prime Day 2018 will be held for a record 36 hours in a row and offer one million deals exclusively for Prime members around the world. This year’s event will be held in 17 countries, including in the U.S., U.K., Spain, Mexico, Japan, India, Italy, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium, Austria and – new this year – Australia, Singapore, Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
* There are also select deals being offered at all U.S. Whole Food Market stores.
* What’s on sale? This year, the mega-site is focusing on offering deals across TVs, smart home, kitchen, grocery, toys, fashion, furniture, appliances, and back-to-school supplies. Everyday essentials will also be discounted. Prime Day will also feature double the deals on Amazon devices, including  Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV, and Fire tablets, in addition to new categories from home security to Echo devices with screens.
* According to Jeff Wilke, Amazon CEO Worldwide Consumer:
* New this year, members can shop exclusive Prime Day Launches from hundreds of brands worldwide, enjoy exclusive savings at Whole Foods Market and experience surprise entertainment events unboxed from giant Smile boxes in major cities. More than 100 million paid Prime members around the world will find our best Prime Day celebration yet.
* First held in 2015, Amazon Prime Day has steadily grown over the years both in the number of countries where it is held and the number of items available at discounted rates. Though the biggest deals are reserved for the actual event, your best bet is to be on the lookout for deals every day beginning right now.
* For example, Amazon is already offering the Echo Show for $100 off and dropping the prices on Amazon Brands items such as 25 percent off furniture and 20 percent off AmazonBasic items. You’ll also find 50 percent off discounts on popular movies and TV shows on digital, DVD, and Blu-Ray.
* What kind of deals are you hoping to see this year? Let us know below.
