* With just a little more than 24 hours to go until Apple’s major September 9 media event, an anonymous Reddit post on Monday shared half a dozen technical drawings seemingly revealing a plethora of iWatch parts while pointing at the device’s rectangular appearance, a round sensor plate at the bottom and other design features.
* While Reddit is not an accurate source of leaks, the detailed nature of the schematics (reposted on Imgur) should not be dismissed lightly even though we can’t vouch for the veracity of the images nor can we confidently say the device pictured is in fact Apple’s wearable gizmo.
* According to the poster, the images come from Quanta, Apple’s rumored contract manufacturer for iWatch assembly work.
* Seen below: a purported rectangular-shaped housing for the device. The circular region positioned in the bottom is where iWatch’s health and fitness sensors would be found. The sensor plate will be “in contact with the skin”.

* The various drawings reveal alleged hardware features of the device, including a microphone and speaker. The iWatch’s printed circuit board is presumably laden with sensors and is thought to include an Apple-made chip said to be round.

* The P2B and EVT labels stand for an early prototype phase and the engineering validation test stage.

* The poster claims that iWatch will be waterproof to 20 meters. There won’t be any connectors, not even Lightning I/O, indicating the device will rely on wireless connectivity in order to sync with other Apple devices. We also heard there will be wireless charging.

* The battery should last over a day and the multi-touch screen is flexible.

* Because there’s a speaker and a mic, chances are that iWatch will include support for Siri, or at least act as a remote microphone for Siri on your iPhone.

* As per the poster, the iWatch will come in four different colorways and two sizes, one for men (1.5 inches) and the other optimized for a woman’s wrist (1.3 inches).

* Last but not least, iWatch mass production is allegedly scheduled to start in January though the definite timeline has not yet been finalized. “This is the most complex and expensive product to manufacture to date,” wrapped up the poster.
* Apple should unveil the iWatch alongside the new iPhones at its media event tomorrow scheduled to start at 10am PDT at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California.
* What do you guys think?
* Do these drawings represent an Apple wearable?
