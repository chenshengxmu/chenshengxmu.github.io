title: Are USB Type-C advancements making the standard more feasible?

* It wasn’t long ago that I shared my thoughts about why the USB Type-C standard wasn’t perfect yet, but some vital, forward-thinking milestones have started trickling their way down the manufacturing lines, and it smells like progress.
* While many USB Type-C cables continue to display limitations regarding data speed, power delivery, or both, some brands are making a difference by offering the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t quite say the standard is perfect yet.
* As I indicated in my original piece, my primary pain point with USB Type-C was that I couldn’t find a practical all-in-one cable for my 2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.
* Deficiencies in the existing market (at the time) made it challenging to locate a cable supporting both 100W power delivery and USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10Gb/s) data transfer speeds. Most relevant cables maxed out at around 60W power delivery, but some supported 100W power delivery at the expense of reduced data speeds (pitiful USB 2.0).
* Given that the MacBook Pro occasionally pulls 87W of power at peak performance, 60W wouldn’t be enough for the long haul. I found myself either carrying two separate cables with me during my travels to support my power needs and peripherals, or settling with a single cable that exhibited either awful charging or data transfer speeds.
* Fortunately, brands like Anker and Belkin pioneered what I like to call a USB Type-C revolution. Anker’s PowerLine II ($19.99 on Amazon) and Belkin’s USB Type-C cable ($29.99 on Amazon) each support both 100W power delivery and USB 3.1 Gen 2 transfer speeds (10Gb/s). These were some of the first major brands to manufacture a USB Type-C cable with the best of both worlds, and the floodgates are now opening as a quick search on Amazon would indicate.
* It seems like a blessing that these two respected brands would finally introduce almost precisely what I was looking for this entire time, but the key word in that comment is “almost.”
* While these cables will do just about everything I could ever aspire for them to do, you might have noticed that both measure just one meter in length. Comparatively, the OEM USB Type-C charging cable that ships with Apple’s 2016/2017 MacBook Pro measures two meters in length.
* If you happen to have one of those OEM extension cables from an earlier Mac notebook, then this isn’t as much of a problem. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t include one with the 2017 MacBook Pro (and perhaps other new machines), which leaves a plethora of people with limited options.
* That said, if you choose to use one of these one-meter cables, you’ll either need to purchase an Apple OEM extension cable from Apple for $19.00 to meet your distance needs, or you’ll be hugging the wall on which any power outlet you choose to use resides.
* Nope; not really the ideal situation – but it’s better than it was just a couple of months ago.
* There are no clear indications about what’s taking so long to develop the “perfect” USB Type-C cable, but if I had to guess, limitations inside the circuitry at each terminating end of the cable could have something to do with it. Perhaps the hardware driving both the scale-tipping data and power delivery speeds is only robust enough to send the signal across one meter of cable.
* With all things considered, it seems like manufacturing companies are only just beginning to scratch the surface of the capabilities introduced by the USB Type-C standard, and it could be a while before the ideal product finally launches to the public.
* On the other hand, research and development got us this far, so it only seems obvious that manufacturers are on the verge of progress. Perhaps with a bit more patience, the perfect USB Type-C cable will eventually surface.
* Are you satisfied with the current USB Type-C standard, or would you like to see it evolve even further? Let us know in the comments section below.
