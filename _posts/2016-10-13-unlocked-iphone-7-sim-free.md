* Heads up to those of you who have been waiting for SIM-free iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models to come available. You can now buy the unlocked handsets on Apple’s website, starting at $650 and $770, respectively.
* While you could previously buy the iPhone 7 at full retail, it had to be tied to a carrier. These new models, as the name suggests, come without a SIM card, meaning they can be active with any carrier at a later time.
* From Apple’s website:
* The SIM-free iPhone comes without a wireless contract commitment or carrier financing. It doesn’t come with a nano-SIM card. And because it’s unlocked, it isn’t tied to one carrier, so you can get a nano-SIM from any supported carrier worldwide, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, or Sprint in the United States.
* If you’re interested in purchasing the SIM-free iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you can do so here on Apple’s website. Just select which size handset you want, and then pick the SIM-free option in the Select your carrier section.
* Thanks chaiyk!
