* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Beat Stomper. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the music-based vertical jumper for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $2.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Absolutely exploding with style and energy, this infinite jumper challenges you to guide little leaping block people up, up, and away into musical heaven. Using taps to hurl your angular avatars from one shifting platform to the next, you’ll aim for boosts that’ll rocket them even higher—or at least keep them from plunging to their game-ending doom. With pulsing electronic music and eyeball-caressing neon visuals, it’s like a dance party for your brain. Joyously simple and simply joyous. 
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Beat Stomper is available in the App Store for free.
