* If you’ve been keeping up with the latest jailbreak trends, then you might have heard about CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2. It doesn’t install Cydia or Mobile Substrate like a typical jailbreak tool would, but you could still use this jailbreak to install third-party extensions on your device via SSH.
* A constant flow of updates since Electra’s initial release has provided the tool with necessary bug fixes. This week, users can take advantage of beta 7, which makes the jailbreak more stable and offers additional bells and whistles out of the box.
* Citing the official Electra website, the following changes are present in beta 7:
* One thing worth noting is that Electra uses an implementation of jailbreakd, and Saurik plans to move away from jailbreakd in place of an entirely-new dyld-hooking mechanism when he releases the updated Mobile Substrate alongside Cydia for iOS 11.
* It’s uncertain whether the two would be compatible with Electra when the time comes, so we can only recommend that avid jailbreakers who’ve preserved their iOS 11.1.2 devices continue waiting for an official update from Saurik before proceeding with it.
* Electra includes an uninstall script for returning your device to a non-jailbroken state, and several Reddit users have purportedly used the latest version of Electra without any problems. On the other hand, we haven’t tried it ourselves, so we can’t speak for its reliability. You use Electra at your own risk.
* Personally, I’ll keep waiting until I see an official update from Saurik. In the meantime, let us know if you’ve used Electra on your iOS 11 device in the comments section below.
