* Can this guy be stopped? Hot off the heels of the super-popular Springtomize, Filippo Bigarella is back with his latest jailbreak concoction.
* CleverPin is a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone that allows you to make the iPhone’s passcode lock a little less intrusive from a day-to-day usage perspective.
* Ask yourself the following question, and answer honestly; if you’re at home, do you really need that passcode lock enabled?
* Some of you may, but a good lot of you may not. That’s where CleverPin lives up to its cleverness; it disables the annoying passcode lock when you’re within the vicinity of a pre-authorized network, such as your home…
* Security nuts may be quick to dismiss such a tweak as foolishness, but again, depending on your personal circumstances, it could be a great solution for you.
* For instance, if you live alone, or you live with people that you (I hope) trust, then is that passcode lock really necessary while lounging around the house?
* Of course, the aforementioned questions have less to do with the tweak, and more to do with your own sense of security, but it’s a relevant question in light of CleverPin’s functionality.

* Once the tweak is installed, a new settings section in your Settings.app will appear that allows you to customize the tweak to your liking.
* You can designate specific networks for CleverPin, so that your passcode will automatically disable once connected to those networks.
* There are also options to disable the passcode when playing music, charging your battery, or entering airplane mode.

* Obviously, you’re probably not going to add your favorite coffee shop’s network to your list of pre-approved locations, but this could be useful while at home, or perhaps a family member or friend’s dwelling that you visit often.
* As far as the music, and battery options go, I’d be a little more hesitant to use those because it provides you with no protection after leaving a trusted premises.
* CleverPin is not currently available on the Cydia store, but it should be available shortly for the price of $2.99.

* Is it worth $2.99? Well that depends on your level of trust, and how much you enjoy the added convenience that it brings to the table. I certainly approve of the added convenience, and will happily fork over the price of a tall latte for CleverPin.
* What do you think about the idea?
