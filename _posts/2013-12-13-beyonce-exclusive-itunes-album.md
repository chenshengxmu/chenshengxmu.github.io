* The American singer, songwriter and actress, Beyoncé, has made an unusual move of releasing her fifth self-titled studio album exclusively on Apple’s iTunes. Available today from the iTunes Store, the release is dubbed a ‘visual album’ and arrives with a heavy marketing push from Apple – the iTunes Store is currently featuring Beyoncé’s album on all rotating carousel at the top, with links to her previous albums.
* You didn’t even know she was working on a new alubm? You’re not the only one! Visual album? That’s because each song comes with an accompanying music video (plus a digital booklet), a great treat given music videos are normally sold separately of songs…
* As seen on the screenie top of post, the entire iTunes Music Store carousel is dominated by Beyoncé’s new album. I know, she is an international pop star, but to take all of the advertising spaces is just unprecedented and a first for iTunes, if I’m not mistaken.
* The album contains fourteen songs, eighteen videos and a digital booklet and is available for $15.99, exclusively from iTunes.
* From the blurb:
* Beyoncé’s fifth studio endeavor is a provocative, unguarded artistic statement – revealing a side of the icon previously unknown to fans and cementing her status as a pop visionary.
* The roster of guest collaborators includes JAY Z, Drake, Frank Ocean, Pharrell Williams, Timbaland, Michele Williams, Kelly Rowland, Justin Timberlake and more.
* Adding a striking dimension to the music, the complementary videos unfold amid an international backdrop of New York, Paris, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro. 
* Songs will be available for individual purchase on December 20, according to Apple.
