* According to Apple’s support document, this software enables high-definition previews for movies and televisions shows from the iTunes Store. It also fixes an issue that caused some iOS apps to have trouble connecting via AirPlay.
* The reliability of Home Sharing connections has also been improved. Additionally, the download addresses an issue affecting Netflix login and navigation and contains a number of stability and performance fixes.
* As always, jailbreakers with an Apple TV 2 are advised against applying the new software as an untethered jailbreak is still being worked on.
* To those still running a stock Apple TV 2 – please jailbreak it and here’s why.
* iDB also provides a wealth of resources concerning jailbreaking the Apple TV 2.
* And while we’re at it, Cody has also done a really good explanation of the Apple TV jailbreak status so you’re advised to check out his article as well.
* Feel free to share any tips down in the comments.
