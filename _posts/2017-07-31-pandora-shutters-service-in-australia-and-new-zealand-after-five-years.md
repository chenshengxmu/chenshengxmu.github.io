* After five years, Pandora today shut down its service in Australia and New Zealand in a cost-cutting move that will let the company sharpen focus on the US market.
* As first reported on by Music Business Worldwide, the digital radio company is officially closing down its app and website in the Australasia territories on Monday, July 31.
* “We’re honored to have connected so many listeners with the music they love these past few years. Thank you for your loyalty and the opportunity to serve you,” reads Pandora’s message to the affected customers in the region.
* Approximately five million registered customers across Australia and New Zealand will be locked out of their accounts. At the end of the first quarter of 2017, the service had 76.7 million active monthly listeners worldwide.
* Pandora launched its service in Australia and New Zealand five years ago in 2012.
