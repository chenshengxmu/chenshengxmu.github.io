* Apple in March 2017 purchased the powerful iOS automation app Workflow. Even though Workflow is now free and the company has refunded some of the users who have paid for the app, it seems that no new features will be coming to Workflow going forward. That’s according to French blog iGeneration, which reported Thursday that the Workflow team’s confirmed that the software will no longer be updated with new features.
* Any future updates will strictly focus on resolving bugs and compatibility issues. The information was corroborated in the latest episode of the Accidental Tech Podcast featuring Marco Arment, Casey Liss and John Siracusa.
* Workflow was last updated on March 22, 2017 with compatibility requirements, integration updates and bug fixes. Following the acquisition, the app has gone free but some services have since been removed, including several Google services.
* If the reports are to be trusted, Apple may be planning to implement Workflow functionality across iOS and possibly even macOS were it to augment or completely replace Automator and scripting technologies with Workflow technology.
* At any rate, we should learn more about the company’s plans for the app at Worldwide Developers Conference in June.
* Grab Workflow for free on App Store.
