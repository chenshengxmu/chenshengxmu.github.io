* We review tons of apps here on iDB, covering the vast majority of categories available in the App Store. But are these apps interesting to you? For instance, I don’t care much about gaming, and I’m much more interested in learning about new productivity apps. You, on the other hand, might have no interest in productivity apps but would like to see more News-related apps covered on iDB.
* To make sure we publish reviews you actually care about, we thought that asking you directly what you want to see on iDB would be the best way to go at it, which is why we have created this simple poll.
* We have listed the main App Store categories below, and all we need from you is to choose the 3 you’re most interested in. The results will help us adjust our coverage of apps on iDB and give you more of what you’re most into.
* What kind of apps should we write about?
* Because a poll offers limited options, please feel free to share your feedback in the comments section below. Tell us what you like, what you don’t like, and how we can improve our overall coverage of apps.
* Thank you for your help!
