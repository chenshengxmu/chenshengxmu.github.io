* A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a 2013 decision finding Apple guilty for conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices, reports The Wall Street Journal. As a result, the company is expected to pay a $450 million settlement it agreed to with private plaintiffs, 30+ states and the DOJ last year.
* “We conclude that the district court correctly decided that Apple orchestrated a conspiracy among the publishers to raise e-book prices,” wrote Second Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston. The conspiracy “unreasonably restrained trade” in violation of the Sherman Act, the federal antitrust law, she wrote.
* The $450 million will be in addition to the millions of dollars Apple spent on litigation and legal fees over the past 3 years. Despite the fact that all 5 book publishers involved in the price-fixing case reached individual settlements with the DOJ, Apple has maintained its innocence and chosen to fight the suit.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the saga, in 2012 the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Apple and 5 major book publishers for conspiring to raise e-book prices. Apple was found guilty of the charge in 2013, and has since lost multiple appeals in an effort to get the decision overturned.
