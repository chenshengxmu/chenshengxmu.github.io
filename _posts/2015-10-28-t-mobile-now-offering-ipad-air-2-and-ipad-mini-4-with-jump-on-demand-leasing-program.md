* According to wireless carrier T-Mobile Thursday, qualified customers can now pick up Apple’s iPad Air 2 or the fourth-generation iPad mini by taking advantage of the company’s 18-month leasing program, called JUMP! On Demand.
* The baseline iPad Air 2 configuration with sixteen gigabytes of storage is available with $0 down and eighteen installments at $26 per month. The entry-level 16GB iPad mini 4 starts at $22 per month with $0 due upfront. Both devices are LTE models.
* The 18-month lease program allows qualified customers to upgrade to a newer tablet up to three times per year.
* The full pricing is as follows (taxes excluded):
* iPad Air 2 (Wi-Fi + Cellular)
* iPad mini 4 (Wi-Fi + Cellular)
* The limited-time offer includes a $15 SIM starter kit and requires qualified service for the duration of lease. For an additional $10 per month, you can add another tablet and match the data on your Simple Choice voice plan (up to five gigabytes per month) for use specifically on your iPad.

* If you’re upgrading to an iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4, T-Mobile requires you to trade-in your old device in good condition at participating company stores in order to upgrade to an eligible device on lease, up to three times a year.
* If you cancel wireless service, remaining payments on your iPad become due. At the end of the lease period, customers can either return their device in good condition or exercise the purchase option. This offer is only available by visiting your local T-Mobile store or calling T-Mobile at 1-877-500-6055.
