* Apple released iOS 6.1 beta to developers earlier today and we’ve been on the hunt for new interesting features ever since. iDB reader Darryl R. sent us an interesting find that isn’t life changing, but still deserves a little attention.
* When playing a song from the Music app, if you are on the Lockscreen and double tap the Home button, you will notice the new music controls and layout that are now consistent with the controls you find inside the Music app itself…
* As I said above, it’s probably not going to change your life, but it will certainly make your Music experience that much more pleasant.
* As always, please make sure to let us know if you find anything interesting in iOS 6.1.
