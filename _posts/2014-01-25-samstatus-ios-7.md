* SameStatus is a new jailbreak tweak that does something incredibly simple: it allows you to make the size of the Lock screen status bar match the size of the Home screen status bar.
* I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but the information contained on the status bar on iOS 7’s Lock screen is a bit larger than the same info shown on the Home screen status bar. SameStatus is tweak that allows you to “fix” this issue.
* Once you install SameStatus, there are no options or settings to configure, just install it and go. Once you respring from installation, you’ll immediately notice that the Lock screen’s status bar info matches the size of the Home screen’s status bar info.
* SameStatus is a ridiculously simple tweak, but I like it a lot, and recommend it. If you want to try it, then go to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it can be had for free.
* What do you think about SameStatus? Do you plan on using it? Do you think it’s even needed?
