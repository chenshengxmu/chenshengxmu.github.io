* Apple has seeded the third beta of OS X 10.9.4 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The update comes almost a month after Apple released OS X 10.9.3 to the public, which included improved 4K display support and more.
* Today’s new 10.9.4 build is available to developers via an update in the Mac App Store or as a download on Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s new public Mavericks Beta Seed program yet…
* As with many of the OS X 10.9.3 betas, Apple has asked developers to focus on Graphics Drivers and Safari, but it has also added a few other areas for them to look at including Bluetooth, Audio Drivers, Finder and the Mac App Store.
* It’s unclear what improvements the 10.9.4 update will bring to Mavericks, as no new features have been mentioned in the seed notes yet, but it is expected to be the last major Mavericks release before Apple rolls out OS X Yosemite this fall.
* Today’s build is labeled 13E19, a small step up from last week’s build of 13E16, suggesting that Apple is getting close to releasing the update to the public.
