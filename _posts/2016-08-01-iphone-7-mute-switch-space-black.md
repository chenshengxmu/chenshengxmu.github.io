* A lot of people seem to be excited for the supposed iPhone 7 variant in Space Black, resembling the Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch or the dramatic Darth Vader-like black-clad appearance of the iPhone 5. Dutch publication TechTastic.nl on Monday published a photo of an alleged Mute switch for the next iPhone.
* What’s especially interesting about this particular part leak is the part’s finish that strongly suggest—assuming the component is genuine—that the next iPhone will in fact be offered in Space Black.
* The publication could not determine the source of the photo.
* iDownloadBlog cannot vouch for the veracity of this particular rumor as these things are easily faked, but this isn’t the first time we’ve heard talk of a new, much darker appearance for the next iPhone.

* Rumors of an iPhone 7 Space Black variant can be traced back to the Japanese publication Mac Otakara, which originally said Apple is looking to add a deep blue color variant to this year’s iPhone before changing its mind and saying that the hue is going to be closer to a “dark Space Black,” similar to that used for the Apple Watch.
