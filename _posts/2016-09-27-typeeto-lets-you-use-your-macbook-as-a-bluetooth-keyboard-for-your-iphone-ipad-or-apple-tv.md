* While lots of people aspire to have a Bluetooth keyboard to use to type on their iPhone or iPad, not everyone has a pocket deep enough to go out and purchase another peripheral.
* Fortunately, an app called Typeeto lets you use the keyboard built into your MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro to type on your iOS devices.
* If you have an iMac, Mac Mini, or Mac Pro, then you’re probably already used to being able to pair your keyboard to your iOS devices, but the keyboard on Apple notebooks has never really worked the same way.
* After installing Typeeto on your MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro from the Mac App Store, you can pair your computer with your iOS device and start using it in as little as a few seconds. There’s no need to install any additional software on your iPhone or iPad.
* You will need to make sure Bluetooth is enabled on both your Mac and your iPhone or iPad to continue. If it is, just open the Bluetooth settings on both devices and pair them after they’ve been discovered.
* On the Mac, it should look like this:

* And on your iPhone or iPad, it should look like this:

* Once you’re all paired up, you’ll see a momentary HUD from the Typeeto app that lets you know you’re connected, and you should also hear an audible chirp sound from the app.

* At this point, you’re ready to start typing, so open up a text-editing app on your iPhone or iPad and start typing from your Mac’s keyboard.

* There’s next to no delay between typing on my Mac and the text appearing on my iPhone, so the user experience is no less than great.
* The app on the Mac is pretty bare-bones, but it does have some settings you can configure. An icon is added to the Menu Bar so you can interact with the Typeeto app:

* Going into the Preferences option takes you to the app’s configuration settings. From here, you can see how many devices you’ve paired, set up some keyboard shortcuts, and choose whether or not the app runs when you first log into your computer.

* Another useful option here is the ability to past your Mac’s clipboard text to your iOS device with the use of a special keyboard shortcut, which is another essential for text-editing if you’re using your iPhone or iPad to compose something longer than a simple text message.
* Typeeto is a really nifty way to use your Mac’s keyboard as a Bluetooth keyboard for your iPhone or iPad, but it can also be used with your Apple TV or game consoles too. In situations where you don’t want to buy a whole new keyboard to type on your mobile devices, this app comes in handy.
* If you want to give Typeeto a try, you can download it for free from the Mac App Store.
