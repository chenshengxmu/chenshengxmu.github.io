* I’ve talked about Xpandr before, the jailbreak app that allows you to create shortcuts, a la TextExpander. When iOS 4 came up, it seems that Xpandr didn’t support it right away, which led me to remove it from my iPhone, or rather not install it when a jailbreak for iOS 4 came out. Up until now, I was using TextExpander which is great but is supported by very few apps in iOS.
* Yesterday, while I was calling for a dev to create a jailbreak tweak to integrate TextExpander to any iOS application, I was quickly reminded by several of you of the existence of Xpandr, so I installed it again, and to my great surprise, I realized it was working with iOS 4. The love story started all over again…
* For those of you who don’t know Xpandr, it is an app very similar to TextExpander, which is my most used application on my Macs right now ($35 in the Mac App Store). Xpandr lets you create a library of abbreviation shortcuts for snippets of text that you use frequently, such as addresses, URLs, and standard replies.
* As someone who is asked at least 20 times a day how to unlock or jailbreak the iPhone, this is a life saver. Instead of typing the long URL to our unlock page, I simply enter the shortcut I created, which automatically transforms into the full URL.
* For example, instead of typing in “http://www.idownloadblog.com/unlock/”, I simply enter my shortcut “uunlock”, and it is instantly changed into the full URL http://www.idownloadblog.com/unlock/. Brilliant!
* I also use Xpandr to create shortcuts for my name, email signatures, phone number, address, and full email replies to the questions I most frequently get asked. I can’t imagine how much time Xpandr will save me in the long run.
* You can get Xpandr from Cydia for $1.99. If you find yourself typing the same information over and over again, then these will be the best two dollars you will ever spend.
