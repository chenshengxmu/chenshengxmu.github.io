* Now that a method exists for downgrading A5 devices, a greater number of folks will be looking for an easy solution to jailbreak their devices.
* While the Absinthe jailbreak tool still works, RedSn0w may be more desirable to you due to its all encompassing nature.
* For that reason we’ve put together a handy guide that shows you how to jailbreak your iPhone 4S and iPad 2 using RedSn0w 0.9.11b1…
* Note: You must be on iOS 5.0.1 to use this tutorial. You can downgrade to iOS 5.0.1 if you have your SHSH blobs saved for iOS 5.0.1. See our iOS 5.0.1 downgrade tutorial for more details.
* Step 1: Connect your A5 device to your computer and run RedSn0w 0.9.11b1.
* Step 2: Click jailbreak, and you will see an info window appear.
* Step 3: On your iPhone you will notice a new profile window. Tap Install > Install Now > Next (no password) > Done.
* Step 4: You will see another info window via RedSn0w.
* Step 5: Enable the VPN option in Settings and the jailbreak will be triggered.
* Step 6: You may notice VPN errors, these can be ignored. The device will reboot, and once it reboots you will notice Cydia on your Home screen.
* That’s it! There’s no DFU mode involved or anything like that, so this is one of the easiest jailbreaks to accomplish. It works pretty much the same as the Absinthe jailbreak, but I found RedSn0w’s Corona implementation a little more reliable than Absinthe. This was performed on a Windows machine, but it works exactly the same on a Mac.
* Has it worked for you? What have you found? For more in-depth information on RedSn0w, be sure to check out our full dedicated RedSn0w page.
