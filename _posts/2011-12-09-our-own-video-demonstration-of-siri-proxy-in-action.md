* Late last night I set out with the goal of getting the much talked about Siri Proxy server running on my iMac and iPhone 4S. After a couple of hours of tinkering, I could finally report success.
* We’ve all seen the videos, but actually using it yourself is a whole different experience. It’s really amazing what Pete “Plamoni” Lamonica has been able to pull off with Siri Proxy.
* What’s even better is that there’s all sorts of plugins available to take advantage of. Check inside as we go hands-on with the Twitter and IMDB plugins for this wonderful Siri enhancer…
* And here’s the initial test where I first got Siri Proxy working:
* To pull this off, I created an Ubuntu virtual machine using Parallels 7 for Mac OS X Lion. It’s actually a fairly easy setup to pull off with the right instructions.
* In no time I was asking Twitter to tweet, and asking IMDB who starred in my favorite films. Siri was definitely up to the task, and I came away mighty impressed.
* Now this question remains: Would you like a tutorial that shows how to install Siri Proxy on your virtual machine? Let us know what you think in the comments below.
