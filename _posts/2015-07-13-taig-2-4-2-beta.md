* TaiG is pushing ahead with new releases of its TaiG jailbreak tool on an almost daily basis it seems. This latest version of TaiG is a beta release, version 2.4.2.
* The latest beta version of the TaiG jailbreak tool is Windows-only, which isn’t exactly a surprise given TaiG’s release history. It also serves, more importantly, to fix jailbreak errors related to 30% and 40% hang-ups during the jailbreak process.
* Here is the full change log for TaiG 2.4.2:
* You can download TaiG 2.4.2 from our downloads page.
* After some testing, TaiG 2.4.2 should be promoted to a public version. Until then, TaiG is recommending that most users stick to the public 2.4.1 version.
* From what I can recollect, this release should put a cap on most of the hang-up errors related to the TaiG jailbreak, as the last release, version 2.4.1, fixed the notorious 60% errors. Have you had issues with TaiG hanging at 30% or 40%? Does this fix your issues?
