* According to a rumor by Japanese blog Mac Otakara, Apple may extend its iPhone 6s battery replacement program to iPhone 6 following reports from iPhone 6 owners who claim to have been plagued with the same issues as their iPhone 6s counterparts.
* UPDATE: an unnamed source inside Apple corporate told AppleInsider that there are no immediate plans to offer a battery exchange program for iPhone 6 devices. “We constantly evaluate service statistics,” said the source. “There are no plans or grounds for a wide iPhone 6 battery exchange program at this time.”
* Mac Otakara is a fairly reliable blog, but the outlet cautions that this is just a rumor and notes that it has no idea whether or not Apple will indeed offer a free battery replacement to iPhone 6 owners who may be experiencing unexpected shutdowns.
* Apple originally discovered that some iPhone 6s units manufactured between September and October 2015 may unexpectedly shut down when the battery charge level falls below thirty or so percent.
* The company issued a global iPhone 6s battery replacement program (see if your device is eligible for a free battery replacement using Apple’s web tool), saying a manufacturing issue is causing affected batteries to degrade faster than usual.
