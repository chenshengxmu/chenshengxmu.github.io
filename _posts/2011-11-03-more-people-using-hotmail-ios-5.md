* Apple added quick setup support for Microsoft’s Hotmail email service in the Mail app on iOS 5, and the Redmond company has announced that it’s seen a massive surge in Hotmail activations since the public launch of Apple’s latest mobile software.
* Microsoft is seeing 100,000 new iOS 5 devices log into the email provider every day, and over 2 million users have linked their iDevices to Hotmail on iOS 5.
* In a blog post yesterday Microsoft’s Chris Jones revealed that the company is very pleased with its user adoption on the iOS 5 platform. The majority of Hotmail users are on the iPhone 4 running iOS 5, while 12% of users are still on the iPhone 3GS.
* iOS also supports Exchange Active Sync, allowing users to sync email, calendars, reminders, and contacts between devices. Apple opened the iOS platform up to the enterprise market when it added Exchange support, and now more businesses are starting to support the iPhone and iPad.
* Here’s a chart of Hotmail users on iOS 5 devices:

* While Gmail continues to arguably be the most popular email service for devices like the iPhone, and Apple offers its iCloud email service for free, Hotmail isn’t seeing a decline in users. In fact, Microsoft thinks that “it’s a great time to switch to Hotmail.”
* We wouldn’t go that far, Microsoft.
