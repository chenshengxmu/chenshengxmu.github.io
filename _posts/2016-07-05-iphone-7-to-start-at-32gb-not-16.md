* The storage options for the iPhone 7 will feature a higher starting point, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing a person familiar with Apple’s plans, the outlet says that instead of 16GB, the entry level model will come with 32GB of storage.
* This isn’t the first time we’ve heard this is going to happen with this year’s iPhone, but coming from a source like The Journal certainly adds more weight to the theory. If true, this will solve a pain point that has been plaguing users for years.
* Currently, your only iPhone storage options are 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. The 128GB is fine for a high-end option, but 16GB is so low it forces users to pick between closely budgeting their storage space, or forking over an extra $100 for 64GB.
* Other expected changes for the iPhone 7 include a new rear case design with cleaner antenna lines, an improved iSight camera, and of course the removal of the headphone jack. The handset is expected to be introduced sometime in September.
