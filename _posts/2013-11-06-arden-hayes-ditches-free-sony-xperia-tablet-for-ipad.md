* This is gold. Arden Hayes, a famous Trivia expert from southern California, may not be your typical example of an Apple buyer because he doesn’t have income coming in.
* And who could blame him: Arden is just a five-year-old who previously appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.
* There, the youngster has demonstrated his amazing knowledge of U.S. presidents, earning himself a nickname of the ‘little genius’.
* In another Jimmy Kimmel appearance, Hayes flatly refuses to take a free Sony Xperia tablet because “we’re just planning to get an iPad for Christmas”.
* Apple sure knows how to get them while they’re young, doesn’t it?
* Your video is right after the jump…
* Here, check this out.
* Wise beyond his years, no?
* For those unfamiliar with Arden, the kid can list all 44 U.S. presidents from memory, recite Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and just outright amaze with a barrage of various stats and trivia concerning the American presidents.
* Another factoid: Arden and Franklin Delano share the same January 30 birthday.
* As for the iPad, some grown-ups could learn a lot from Arden.
* Over at Fortune, writer JP Mangalindan in a desperate linkbait asks whether the iPad Air is “necessary.”
* I guess Mangalindan didn’t get the memo that consumers have long voted with their wallet on that one. Besides, his write-up suspiciously borrows cues from the funny clip (see above) from the crazy Taiwanese animation shop, Next Media Animation.
