* New evidence of the larger iPhone 6 surfaced online this morning. 9to5Mac has posted a pair of images believed to be a display component for Apple’s oft-rumored 5.5-inch smartphone—one of two handsets the company is believed to be launching this fall.
* While we’ve seen plenty of case and part leaks for the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, physical evidence of the larger model has been far more scarce. These photos, in fact, are said to be the first showing an iPhone 6 component that matches the 5.5-inch device rumors…
* 9to5Mac explains the implications of the photos:
* Today, Sonny Dickson has exclusively shared with us a pair of photos claimed to be showing the LCD display component for that larger iPhone with 5.5-inch screen. The photos show the display attached to a ruler that indicates a screen with a diagonal measurement of approximately 14cm.
* That 14cm converts to the 5.5-inches heavily rumored for the next-generation Apple smartphone. While these photos do not provide us with any breakthrough information about the new iPhone, the photos, at best, do show that Apple is already producing components for the larger sized phone and this means that production is likely nearing. 
* For reference, here are 5.5 and 4.7-inch iPhone 6 mockups:

* In addition to larger displays, both iPhone 6 models will get refreshed shells with rounded corners, a new antenna design, and a thinner profile. The parts we’ve seen thus far have also pointed to elongated volume buttons and a relocated sleep/wake button.
* As far as internals, the new iPhone is expected to sport an improved camera, a faster A8 processor and various other performance bumps. Code in early iOS 8 betas have also indicated that the handset will feature multiple new sensors, including a barometer.
* We’re looking for the iPhone 6 to launch sometime in September, though it’s been rumored that the 5.5-inch version may be delayed a few months due to production issues. It’s also been speculated that Apple will charge a $100 premium for the larger model.
