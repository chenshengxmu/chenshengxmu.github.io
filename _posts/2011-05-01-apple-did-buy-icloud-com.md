* According to anonymous sources cited by All Things Digital, Apple has indeed purchased the iCloud.com domain.
* Earlier this week, GigaOM reported that Apple had allegedly purchased iCloud.com from Xcerion for the sum of $4.5 million. Apple is rumored to be announcing a major revamp to its current MobileMe cloud service at this summer’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).
* Although All Things D confirms that the purchase was made, its sources declined to confirm the rumored $4.5 million purchase price. 
* “Apple has indeed acquired the domain name iCloud.com from Sweden-based hybrid cloud computing outfit Xcerion. Sources in position to know confirm that Apple bought the domain as GigaOm first reported Thursday, though they declined to say whether its rumored $4.5 million price tag was accurate.”
* According to Whois databases, the iCloud.com domain still shows Xcerion as the owner of the domain. Apple is probably trying to keep the purchase under wraps.
* What are some features you want in Apple’s major revamp of MobileMe?
