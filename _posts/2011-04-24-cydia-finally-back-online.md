* Cydia is finally back online! Literally, after 86 hours of downtime due to Amazon’s EC2 outage, Cydia is up and running.
* Cydia’s founder, saurik (aka Jay Freeman), announced the good news via Twitter. You will now be able to proceed with regular Cydia operations, such as purchasing packages, use of the Theme Center, and managing your Cydia accounts… 
* “After 86 hours offline, Cydia is finally back! I’m eating some celebratory cake, and am looking forward to a night with >1.5 hours of sleep!”

* Now that Cydia is fully functional, be sure to thank @saurik on Twitter for all of his hard work! Long live jailbreaking!
