* The seven-year battle between Samsung and Apple over iPhone patent infringement isn’t over. The Galaxy S9 smartphone maker has rejected the verdict in a recent case that saw a jury award Apple $539 million in damages. Instead, Samsung has filed a motion to have the decision thrown out, according to Law360.
* According to the report:
* In Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.’s 34-page post-trial motion, the Korean tech giant said the jury’s verdict, which awarded Apple Inc. about half of what it requested, wasn’t supported by the evidence and “no reasonable jury” could reach the jury’s conclusion.
* “The jury’s verdict is excessive and against the weight of the evidence on each and every issue identified above, and … the evidence supports a verdict of no more than $28.085 million,” the motion said.
* Late last month, a California jury told Samsung it must pay Apple $539 million for infringing on three design patents with Android phones sold between 2010 and 2011. The unanimous decision was made in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California in San Jose, California. The number was significant because it was higher than what Apple was likely to get based on past court decisions.
* Many have called this the “final” case in the long, worldwide battle between the smartphone giants.
* Apple had initially sought over $1 billion. This is the amount the iPhone maker was awarded initially in 2012 before the case went back to retrial over damages.
* The three design patents covered in this case include rounded corners on phones, the rim that surrounds the face, and the grid of icons that users view. Two utility patents were also covered in the case.
* Apple has until June 21 to respond to the Samsung motion;  a hearing has been scheduled for July 26.
* The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).
