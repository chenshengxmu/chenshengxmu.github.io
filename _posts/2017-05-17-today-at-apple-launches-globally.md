* Announced last month, a series of revamped educational sessions, headlined as “Today at Apple”, launched on Wednesday at Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores globally, with more than 4,000 classes being offered each day this week. The new sessions have been available at Apple Union Square since the store opened.
* “Introducing Today at Apple—inspiring and educational free sessions happening every day at Apple,” said the iPhone maker, adding that “inspiration is now in session”. While content varies from one store to another, the 495 Apple Stores around the world are expected to offer “Photo Walks” and “Kids Hour” sessions by May 20.
* Most sessions are an hour in length. In recognition of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, the Cupertino giant is hosting a bunch of accessibility-related sessions at its stores as well.
* The company shared this promo video to mark the launch of “Today at Apple”.
* As mentioned, these hands-on educational sessions are available starting today in all company-owned retail stores in the US and around the world. The classes range in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design and more.
* In select cities, “Today at Apple” hands-on classes will be led by world-class artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs.
* To mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, Apple shared this morning some inspiring videos showcasing how people with different disabilities are using assistive features built into iPhone, iPad and Mac to make their lives easier.
