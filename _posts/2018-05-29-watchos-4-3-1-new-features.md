* Apple has released watchOS 4.3.1 to the public. The Apple Watch software update is minor, at best, and available now for download over the air (OTA). Here’s everything new in watchOS 4.3.1. 
* Back in March, Apple released watchOS 4.3. The update allowed the Nightstand mode to work both vertically and horizontally, which should come in handy when charging your watch using Apple’s upcoming multi-device Qi wireless charger.
* Additionally, iPhone music browsing and control were reinstated in watchOS 4.3 and there was also a new animation when you connect your watch to a charger.
* Soon after, Apple released the first watchOS 4.3.1 beta to developers.
* Apple is reminding users that apps created for watchOS 1 will not support future versions of watchOS. This message suggests these older apps won’t work once a fourth-generation Apple Watch arrives this fall.
* Bug fixes to address issues found since watchOS 4.3 are also found in this release.
* Apple’s likely to announce significant software updates to watchOS at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Two Apple Watch-related features you might see revealed for the WWDC keynote are third-party Apple Watch faces, and an official Spotify for Apple Watch app.
* To deploy the latest software update over the air, go into the Watch app on iPhone, then select General > Software Update, and follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the update.
* watchOS 4.3.1 fixes an issue which caused Apple Watch to sometimes remain at the Apple Logo during startup for some users.
