* On Tuesday, Apple launched a new service in Japan called ‘iTunes Pass.’ The service allows customers to purchase iTunes Store credit from an Apple retail store using Passbook, eliminating the need for physical gift cards and redemption codes.
* At the time of launch, it was unclear if Apple intended to roll out iTunes Pass to other countries, or if it was merely just testing the waters for a bigger project. After 24 hours, that question was answered tonight when the service popped up in the US…
* Apple has updated the iTunes Gift page on its website to show that iTunes Pass is now available in the US. The company’s Australian site has too been refreshed to show the service has launched, and users in Canada, Germany, and the UK are also seeing it.

* Customers looking to take advantage of the new service can add an iTunes Pass from within the Passbook app. They’ll then present the Pass at their local Apple retail store, request an amount, and the money will be instantly transferred to their account.
* While there isn’t anything groundbreaking about iTunes Pass, it seemingly sets the stage for Apple’s mobile payment system. It’s believed that the company has already begun discussions with retailers to allow customers to make purchases with iPhones.
