* As of today, it’s now possible to share slow-motion videos using Twitter’s iPhone and iPad app, the micro-blogging service announced in a tweet. The feature has been enabled via a silent backend update so there’s no need to update Twitter’s iOS app.
* The ability to upload and share slow-motion videos entails both footage captured in 120 frames per second on your iPhone 5s and higher frame-rate videos at 240 frames per second recorded on the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.
* As shown above, you just attach a video like you normally would via the compose sheet in Twitter’s iOS app. If the slow-motion video being attached is longer than 30 seconds, you’ll be prompted to choose a 30-second segment to share on Twitter.
* This will store a trimmed version of the original video in your iOS Camera roll so you may want to manually delete it afterwards.

* Earlier this week, Twitter rolled out a redesigned ‘Quote Tweet’ feature with comments and refreshed TweetDeck for Mac with group direct messaging feature, inline video, support for animated GIFs and more.
* Twitter is available at no cost in the App Store and Mac App Store.
