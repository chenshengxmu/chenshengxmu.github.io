* Aside from introducing the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition, Apple this morning also announced that a brand new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone X Leather Folio case for iPhon X will be available beginning tomorrow.
* The folio-style case is made out of specially tanned and finished European leather for a luxurious look and feel. I own this case and can attest to its very premium fit and finish.
* But don’t take my word for it, here’s our earlier hands-on with this awesome iPhone X case.
* The (PRODUCT)RED edition comes with all the perks of its standard counterpart, including dual pockets for carrying a credit card and some cash, support for wireless charging, the ability to automatically wake your iPhone X when you open/lock the case and more.
* The accessory is available in Cosmos Blue, Berry, Black and Taupe, while the new (PRODUCT)RED finish will launch tomorrow. The case joins other (PRODUCT)RED devices and accessories from Apple, with a portion of proceeds for all purchasing going directly to Global Fund HIV/AIDS grants that provide testing, counseling, treatment and prevention programs.
* Apple has thus far donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund.
