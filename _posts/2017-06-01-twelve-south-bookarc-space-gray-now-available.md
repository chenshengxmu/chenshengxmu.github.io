* Twelve South just launched a new Space Gray color option for its popular BookArc stand for MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro on Thursday.
* It’s intended to look great with the OEM Space Gray color Apple offers for its MacBook with Retina display and 2016 MacBook Pro (with or without the Touch Bar), and it joins the classic silver finish, made to match the standard aluminum finish of the previous generation MacBook Pro, along with other notebooks in Apple’s lineup.
* Albeit a different color, the Space Gray BookArc still functions like the original BookArc, providing users with a clutter-free solution to storing their notebook when not in use.

* Fortunately, the large open pasture just below the docking station works as a cable catch to help keep things organized.

* BookArc also enables your Apple-branded notebook to operate in clamshell mode with an external display, keyboard, and mouse in a streamlined vertical fashion.
* A silicone insert on the inside of the aluminum stand cradles your notebook with care, preventing unwanted scratches on its metallic surface. The inside of the insert is contoured to create a snug fit under the weight of the notebook, and more importantly, it’s perfectly-balanced to prevent toppling.
* We made a review of the original Twelve South BookArc last year and feel as though you’re getting a high-quality stand for the $50 price tag – keeping both a minimal footprint and empowering you with better storage for your expensive notebook when not in use.
* We also covered the updated model, which added support for the 2016 MacBook Pro, on our YouTube channel earlier this year:

* The new Space Gray option keeps the same price as the original stand, which will be great news for those using a Space Gray machine and are looking for a new desk storage option.
* If you’re interested in picking one up for $49.99, you can head over to Twelve South’s website, where you’ll also find other goodies for your Apple products in addition to the BookArc.
