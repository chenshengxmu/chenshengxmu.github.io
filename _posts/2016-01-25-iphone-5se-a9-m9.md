* Apple’s allegedly upcoming four-inch iPhone refresh, that some people believe will be marketed as ‘iPhone 5se’, is said to include “variants” of the A9 system-on-a-chip and the M9 motion coprocessor, both of which are found inside the iPhone 6s, rather than the previous-generation A8 and M8 chips, according to 9to5Mac.
* This will let the device provide untethered ‘Hey Siri’ functionality, which requires the latest-generation M9 motion coprocessor which can monitor the handset’s microphone in a power-efficient manner.
* In addition, the phone will be reportedly offered in two storage capacities, one should be the entry-level model with sixteen gigabytes of storage and the other will include 64GB of storage.
* “Given the large performance leap, we are told that the ‘5se’ will likely replace the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the iPhone lineup this fall when the iPhone 7 is introduced,” Gurman claims.
* This means that the 2013 iPhone 5s will be discontinued comet this Fall as the iPhone 5se will occupy that price point.
* What do you guys make of this?
