* With the July 10, 2008 release of iPhone OS 2.0, Apple launched the App Store to the public. And with but a week until its fifth year anniversary, the company has posted a nice timeline illustrating the most important moments in the application store’s history. Tim Bradshaw of The Financial Times posted the scanned poster online. Apple apparently sent the poster to a few other major media outlets…
* Bradshaw scanned the poster and posted his on his Tumblr.

* He also created a quick Vine clip highlighting a few key events featured on the timeline, have a look below.
* The App Store notably celebrated its 50 billionth app download ahead of the WWDC keynote. Apple has actually gone to trouble printing out this thing, though that’s not unheard-of.
* In a similar move earlier this year, Apple sent out posters to big media celebrating a decade of iTunes, along with an iTunes Gift Card redeemable for 100 songs cherry-picked by Apple’s editors.
* Soon after, the company followed-up with an interactive iTunes timeline on its website.
* I’ll update the post if and when a similar timeline goes live regarding the App Store anniversary.
