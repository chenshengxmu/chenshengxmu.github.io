* After spending more than a month in testing, Apple on Tuesday released the third major software update to OS X 10.11 El Capitan, its latest and greatest desktop operating system that was released for public consumption in October 2015.
* Available through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab, OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan update is now available for download on any Mac running a prior El Capitan version and is primarily a bug-fix release.
* The new software is being deployed throughout Mac App Stores around the world so wait a little if you don’t see it yet as these things take time to propagate.
* The OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 software update improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac and is recommended to all El Capitan users. The changelog accompanying the download makes no mention of new features, but we’ll be making sure to update the post if we encounter them.
* Five days ago, Apple seeded its registered developers with the first beta of the forthcoming OS X 10.11.4 software update with under-the-hood improvements.
* Apple also today released the iOS 9.2.1 software update for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad with bug fixes and stability updates ahead of a feature-packed iOS 9.3 release, which should be due in March.
* iOS 9.3 packs in the new Night Shift mode, the Notes app protection with Touch ID, multi-user support on iPads for classroom environments and several other enhancements, major improvements and new features.
