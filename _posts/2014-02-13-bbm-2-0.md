* Following a minor refresh recently which brought out a handy new Find Friends feature, Canada’s struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry is today rolling out a new BBM version 2.0. The release contains a few new features such as free voice calling, BBM Channels, Dropbox integration, location sharing and more.
* The free update is rolling out today so keep an eye on the App Store and don’t panic if it’s not live yet as these things take time to propagate.
* The full breakdown is right below the fold…
* Akin to Skype, FaceTime Audio, Viber and other voice-calling applications, VoIP calling in BBM 2.0 requires BBM Voice on both ends, a data plan and Wi-Fi or data coverage. The feature is available via a new green icon in the top righthand corner of a chat conversation.

* BBM Channels, another addition, is basically a group chatting feature which not only lets up to fifty people participate in multi-party conversations, but also create Channels with specific topics based on their interests, ranging from products, hobbies and sports to entertainment, fashion, cars and more.
* “By posting to their channel, channel owners immediately reach their subscribers with a message that can spark discussions,” the company underscored. Ordinary users, brands and businesses can all create Channels around topics, BlackBerry said.
* Here’s a nice promo clip.

* Thanks to Dropbox integration, folks can exchange cloud files between themselves.
* Also new: location sharing. It works similar to Apple’s Find My Friends feature as you can pick specific contacts to share your location with, all in real-time.
* Privacy freaks can opt for time-limited location sharing, so when the timer runs out their location is private again. Location sharing in BBM 2.0 is powered by Glympse.
* Also, this:
* With this new version of BBM there’s more to chat about because you can quickly share a pic, voice note or file with your contacts. Snap a photo or pick one from your gallery; touch and hold to send a voice note; send a calendar event or contact.
* Last but not least, BBM 2.0 has added over a hundred fun emoticons that can be used to spice up your text chats with popular mood icons.
* Here’s the full BBM 2.0 changelog.
* BBM 2.0 is rolling out today so grab it later free of charge in the App Store.
