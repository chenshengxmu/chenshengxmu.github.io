* Now that it’s been all but confirmed that Apple will be hosting a media event in September, the spotlight turns to the focus of the meeting. Obviously, a new iPhone is a given. But what else will Apple be unveiling that day?
* One report suggests that we could see the rumored iPad mini at the event, although there is still no actual evidence that such a product exists. But that’s not stopping case-makers from ramping up production…
* 9to5Mac points to some new DeviceWear cases that surfaced on the web earlier today, and appear to be made for a smaller iPad. The images were taken down shortly after they went live, but 9to5Mac was able to score a couple of photos.
* “Now we’re seeing a first glimpse at some iPad mini cases. According to a few tips we received, case maker DeviceWear posted and took down a website for their own iPad mini cases. We’re not too sure what to make of that, but last year, case maker Case-Mate did the same for the iPhone 5. “
* As you may recall, the iPhone 5 design depicted in the Case-Mate images turned out to be fake — likely a publicity stunt that was piggybacking on the media attention and anticipation surrounding Apple’s new iPhone.
* But real or not, these images do depict a smaller iPad that lines up perfectly with previous reports. The tablet appears to be extremely thin, and has the smaller 19-pin dock connector that Apple is expected to start using in its iOS devices from here on out.
