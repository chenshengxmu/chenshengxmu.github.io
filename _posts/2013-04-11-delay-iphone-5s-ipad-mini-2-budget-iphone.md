* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who actually has a pretty good track record in predicting Apple’s product plans, has some bad news for Apple fans. In a note issued to clients Thursday, he basically wrote that Apple’s next batch of iDevice upgrades may hit the market later than originally expected due to a number of “technical challenges” related to the inclusion of fingerprint sensor beneath the Home button.
* The rumored budget iPhone may be delayed because its slimmer-than-usual polycarbonate casing is proving harder nut to crack, while the second-generation iPad mini continues to face challenges with its high-resolution Retina panels. Jump past the fold for the full disclosure…
* According to Kuo’s note, obtained by AppleInsider, he’s no loner expecting July/September shipments of the FDD/TDD new iPhone version, nor does he see the iPhone 5S, budget iPhone and iPad mini 2 in July, July and August:
* In light of publicly available information and our knowledge of technological trends, we now think all three products will begin shipments later than our previous expectation and market consensus.
* Apple’s decision to encase its less-pricey iPhone into a plastic shell that’s slimmer than these things regularly are is a manufacturing headache:
* The slimmer casing may make it more difficult to ramp up production yields of coating and surface treatment, and could slow down the shipment timetable.
* As for the iPhone 5S, the handset’s design calls for the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor underneath the Home button:
* Apple has to work out how to prevent interference from the black and white coating material under the cover glass.
* Apple is the first to attempt this function and technology, and time is needed to find the right coating material, which will likely affect iPhone 5S shipments.

* Finally, the iPad mini 2 could face delays because 7.9-inch Retina display panels and the thin form factor may make the device more difficult to manufacture.

* These delays could prove disastrous to Apple’s market standing and share price:
* As a result of these issues, Kuo said it’s likely that Apple will see single-digit growth in iPhone and iPad shipments in the third quarter of 2013.
* That would be well below the market consensus, which sees Apple growing its sales by between 30 and 40 percent with the introductions of new products.

* Be that as it may, the report does jive well with whispers of iOS 7 possibly running behind because of a major UI refresh under Jony Ive’s leadership.
* For reference, this is Kuo’s previous Apple roadmap, from January 2013.

* As you can see, analysts don’t expect any major product launch this summer.
* Apple typically refreshes iOS devices once a year. Last year, the company switched from its previous ‘iPhones in summer/iPads in Q1’ scheme with the September/October refreshes to iPhones/iPads.
* This actually makes more sense given the all-important holiday shopping season.
* With intensifying competition, Apple might not be able to talk holiday shoppers into buying gadgets that are already a few months old.
* Besides, Apple is known for its maniacal perfectionism.
* The upcoming iSpaceship campus has reportedly been delayed (again) due to Apple’s exacting requirements
* Jobs was allegedly very exact in terms of gaps between surfaces that gaps between the surfaces be no more than 1/32 of an inch versus the usual U.S. construction standards of one-eighth of an inch.
* And let’s not forget that the white iPhone 4 faced several delays over light leakage problems affecting camera performance, an issue most manufacturers would neglect and just release the damn thing as soon as possible.
* Thoughts?
