* Better late than never: Spotify, the popular music-streaming service hailing from Sweden, today at last gave its iOS clientproper support for the new iPhone screen resolutions so it no longer runs scaled on your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.
* More importantly, version 2.2 has added the “Top Tracks in Your Network” playlist which shows the most played songs among the people you follow.
* Top Tracks in Your Network rolling out as we speak to all users and can be found under the new Top Tracks button in the Browse section of the Spotify app.
* In another useful change, Spotify now puts a name to a face. That is, the faces of friends who listen to the artists and playlists you play are now shown, which makes it easier to find people to follow on Spotify.
* Just tap a face to get to their profile, where you can Follow them. Needless to say, favorite songs from the people you follow crop up in the Top Tracks In Your Network playlist.
* “It looks at the past week of what the people you follow listened to, and tries to pull out tracks played by many people you follow, or that one person listened to over and over,” explains TechCrunch.
* Indeed, as Spotify itself notes:  “The more popular a song is with your friends, the higher it is up the chart.”
* The playlist is refreshed daily.
* There’a also a handy drop down list of the people listening to the song next to the track details, which should help with music discovery by showing you which of your friends share your taste in music.
* Top Tracks in Your Network begins rolling out today on iOS and Android platforms, and to desktop soon, said the firm.
* Spotify 2.2 changelog:
* Spotify has nearly 13 million accounts subscribed to the $9.99 per month Spotify Premium. The company is currently offering new customers a three-month Premium subscription for just $0.99 via a new time-limited promotion.
* Download Spotify free in the App Store.
