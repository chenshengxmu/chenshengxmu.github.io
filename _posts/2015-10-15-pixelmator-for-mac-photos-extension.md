* The popular Photoshop alternative for the Mac, Pixelmator, was updated this morning in the Mac App Store. Bumped to version 3.4, the app includes full support for OS X El Capitan and iOS 9’s Split View mode so you can use Pixelmator with another app in El Capitan’s new side-by-side multitasking mode.
* More importantly, Pixelmator now includes a brand new extension for Apple’s stock Photos app that lets you edit images within the context of the Photos app using Pixelmator’s Metal-based Distort tools.
