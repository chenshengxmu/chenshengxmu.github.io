* Google updated its iOS web browser yesterday to build 25.0.1364.86. The update brought about a handful of new features and improvements, including the option to share web pages via Messages and a tweaked Omnibox.
* Unfortunately, the update also appears to have included a bug that, for a lot jailbreak users, causes Chrome to crash almost instantly after launch. But never fear, we’ve come across a way to fix this issue in just a few short steps…
* Sigh. @googlechrome added untested jailbreak-specific code on iOS; if you have "send crash reports" off, it crashes. https://t.co/HyJnDmqezg

* We’ve actually seen a couple of fixes for Chrome crashing. There is a package in Flex called Chrome Fix Crash (v25), so if you happen to own the app that might be worth checking out.
* But we’ve found a couple ways to fix the app manually:
* First option:
* Second option:
* Again, you’ll have to work quickly. And don’t get discouraged if you don’t get it the first time. It took me a number of tries, but I can confirm, as can the other iDB team members and several readers, that this method does work.
* Assumably, Google will see all of the user complaints and start working on a fix. But given the problem only seems to be affecting those who are jailbroken, we’re not sure how much of a hurry they’ll be in to push out the update.
* Did this fix work for you? Have you found an easier method?
* Thanks mysterious commenter
