* Apple yesterday announced its sales numbers for the latest quarter, and what results they were. 37 million iPhones sold is not a number to be sniffed at, and it’s one that was enough to see Apple overtake Samsung once more as the top dog in smartphone sales.
* The huge number of iPhones sold has also seen Apple’s smartphone overtake Android handsets, with the competition – HTC, Motorola – reporting less than stellar figures themselves…
* According to research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech via Reuters, Apple’s strong iPhone 4S sales saw the company’s marketshare double to 44.9% during the last couple of months of 2011. Conversely, Android saw its own marketshare drop to 44.8%.
* While far from a large margin, it is an astonishing result considering the sheer number of different handsets out there that use Google’s Android smartphone operating system. Apple’s iOS is only available on three – the iPhone 4S, iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS.
* “Apple has continued its strong sales run in the U.S., UK and Australia over the Christmas period. Overall, Apple sales are now growing at a faster rate than Android across the nine countries we cover.”
* Apple’s iPhones are currently slipping out of stores at a rate of nearly 378,000 per day worldwide. That’s more iPhones sold than babies born.
* That’s a lot of iPhones.
