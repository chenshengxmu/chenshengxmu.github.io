* Earlier this year, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Apple and 5 major publishers for allegedly conspiring to fix e-book prices. The trial is set for June of next year.
* Apple maintains that the lawsuit is ridiculous, and vows to fight the allegations. But not everyone is so sure. A federal judge just approved settlements from three of the publishers…
* The Wall Street Journal (via 9to5Mac) reports:
* “In a move that could reshape the publishing industry, a federal judge has approved a settlement with three of the nation’s largest book publishers over alleged collusion in the pricing of e-books… Apple has previously indicated in court papers that it would seek to appeal any decision approving the settlement. As a result, it could take some time before consumers see lower prices on e-books… “It’s devastating to bookstores,” said Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild. “For two years the settling publishers must allow vendors to discount e-books at any price they want. The court acknowledges that this restores the status quo conditions before 2010, when Amazon was able capture 90% of the e-book market. The Justice Department is reshaping the literary marketplace without submitting a single economic study to the court to justify its actions.”
* Yikes. The settlement offer is said to be in the $70 million range and will essentially require the three publishers to terminate their contracts with Apple, as they go back to setting lower e-book prices.
* This will be good for consumers, who should start seeing prices drop on Amazon.com and other services, but bad for Apple’s business, as the company typically takes 30% off the top of all iBook sales.
* Apple tried to have these settlements delayed until after next summer’s trial, but obviously its efforts weren’t fruitful. It’ll be interesting to see how this high-profile case unfolds over the next several months.
