* Tumblr is the home to over a hundred million blogs that have published nearly 50 billion posts. In between blogging for a living here on iDB, checking out new gadgets and just leading an ordinary life, I have little time to maintain a personal blog. But if I did, I’d definitely consider Tumblr as my blogging platform of choice. If you run a Tumblr blog, updating your posts on the go has just become a tad easier as a new version of the official Tumblr iOS app has been released on the App Store with a couple noteworthy additions…
* For starters, the new Tumblr version 3.3.1 contains new social features allowing you to easily share your Tumblr posts on Twitter, Facebook and a few other social networks.
* If you love emailing people entire posts, there’s an all-new email template that will pretty up those email shares. Another handy addition includes ability to save posts for later directly inside the app, using either Instapaper or Pocket, which was also updated yesterday with a new Send to Friend social feature.
* Your Following list is finally sorted alphabetically and can be searched, too. Furthermore, the application will now animate GIFs while you scroll (this doesn’t work on the original iPad, iPhones prior to the 4S and third-generation or older iPod touches.
* Last, but not the least, Tumblr has tweaked its image viewer with a Facebook app-like feature where you just fling a photo up or down to close it.
* Tumblr app, now available for Windows Phone staff.tumblr.com/post/486957318…

* If you’re interested, Tumblr is a free download from the App Store.
* I especially like it because it’s a universal binary so it works natively on my iPad.
* The Android edition of Tumblr was updated earlier in the week with an overhauled user interface and fancy new post animations. You can download that build to your Android device via Google’s Play Store.
* Tumblr for Windows Phone was also released earlier in the week and the team just rolled out their first-ever mobile ads in iOS and Android apps, with ABC Entertainment and ABC Family, GE, Pepsi and Warner Bros all supporting the initiative.
* What this means to you is that every now and then “you’ll see posts from our partners as you scroll through your mobile Dashboard.”
