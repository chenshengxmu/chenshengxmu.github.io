* A new report by Economic Daily predicts Apple will have a lower-priced HomePod in its lineup later this year as well as a more affordable MacBook Air.
* Economic Daily isn’t too specific about the HomePod, not differentiating whether it will be an entirely new product, or simply a price cut to the existing HomePod.
* They are also forecasting a new MacBook Air within the $799-$899 price range. We’ve heard many times conflicting predicting on the MacBook Air. Some have predicted its demise, others expect it to come back as the most cost-efficient notebook in the lineup. Only time will tell which strategy Apple intends to employ.
* It wouldn’t be surprising if there was a low-cost option, as Apple has continued to release affordable options while continuing to expand the high-end.
* “There will be a cheap version of HomePod in the second half of the market.”
* A possible iPhone X Plus could continue to push the upper tier product, while a rumored iPhone SE 2 could continue the budget-friendly option.
* As has also been expected, a new report from Barron’s is predicting the next generation iPad Pro will come equipped with Face ID. They are forecasting the new iPad will arrive in June at WWDC, which is traditionally more of a software-focused event.
* The new iPad Pro could ditch the Home button as well as Touch ID and reduce the bezels further. Smaller bezels would be difficult, as it can already be difficult to hold an iPad without your finger inching onto the screen.
* An Apple Pencil update also would be introduced at the same time.
* Now that is a bunch of different rumors, but what do you make of them? Are there any of these products you are specifically excited for? Let us know below.
