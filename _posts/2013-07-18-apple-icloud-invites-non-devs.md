* During its June WWDC keynote, Apple introduced a new version of its popular productivity suite called iWork for iCloud. Just as the name suggests, the offering brings Apple’s iWork apps—Keynote, Numbers, and Pages—to your browser.
* For a while now, developers have had access to iWork for iCloud through Apple’s beta iCloud portal. But today, the company has reportedly begun inviting non-developer users to join in on the fun by giving them access to the software…
* Here’s the invite:
* “Dear [Redacted],
* We’ll soon be introducing a new and exciting feature to iCloud. It’s called iWork for iCloud and it’s a suite of apps — Pages, Numbers, and Keynote — that make it easy for anyone with an iCloud account to create and edit great-looking documents, spreadsheets, and presentations right on the web.
* We’d like to invite you to be one of the first to try it, so we’re giving you early access to the iWork for iCloud beta. All you have to do is sign in to iCloud on a Mac or a PC using the current version of Safari, Chrome, or Internet Explorer. Then just click on Pages, Numbers, or Keynote and you’re off.
* We’re really proud of these apps and we’d appreciate your help in making them as great as they can possibly be. So we’d love to hear your feedback as you use them.
* Sign in to iCloud.com to get started with iWork for iCloud today.
* Sincerely,
* The iWork Team”
* iWork for iCloud can be accessed via Safari and Chrome browsers, on both PCs and Macs, as well as iOS devices. And at the time of this writing, the service appeared to be nearly fully functional, with features like sync up and running.
* Apple has not set a release date for the final version of iWork for iCloud. But we wouldn’t be surprised if it launched sometime in the fall alongside iOS 7 and, more than likely, the new iPhone.
