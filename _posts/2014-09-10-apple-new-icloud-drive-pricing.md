* At some point during the craziness after yesterday’s event, Apple quietly rolled out new iCloud storage plan pricing. In an update to the iCloud section on its website, the company posted pricing for storage plans ranging from 5GB to 1TB.
* As before, customers will continue to get 5GB of storage for free, with 20GB of additional storage available for $0.99 per month. 200GB of storage will cost you $3.99 per month, 500GB $9.99, and the 1TB plan costs $19.99 per month.
* The pricing brings Apple more in line with competitors, but it’s still a very expensive offering. Dropbox, for example, offers 1TB of storage for just $9.99 per month, as does Google Drive, and both services offer cross-platform/mobile apps.

* Still, the new iCloud Drive service should appease users who have criticized iCloud in the past for its lack of file support and drag-and-drop functionality. It will work with iOS 8, OS X Yosemite, and Apple recently sent out a beta to Windows users.
* iOS 8 launches to the public on September 17th, and OS X Yosemite is expected to drop sometime next month.
