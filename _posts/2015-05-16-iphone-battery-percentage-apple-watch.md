* Although there are quite a few complications that come bundled with the various watch faces on Watch OS 1.0, there a still many features that I’d enjoy that aren’t yet there. One that I would like to see in particular is a readout of your iPhone’s current battery life.
* Checking my iPhone’s battery without having to pull the phone out of my pocket would be swell. Fortunately, there is a way to do this now, although it involves a third-party app and not a complication.
* MacID for iOS, an app that’s generally associated with making it possible to unlock your Mac remotely via Bluetooth, includes such a feature. In fact, you don’t even have to launch the full app to see your iPhone’s battery life, as it’s included in the app’s glance.

* Once you install MacID on your iPhone, the Apple Watch app should automatically install if you have auto-installation enabled. Make sure that you have the glance for MacID turned on, and simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen while your watch face is displayed, and swipe over to the MacID glance to see your iPhone’s remaining battery life.
* As a bonus, the MacID glance also tells you if your iPhone is connected to a cellular connection, or it will display the name of the current Wi-Fi network it’s connected to.
* I’m not aware if there are any additional apps out there that display iPhone battery life (there probably are), but since I already own MacID, and it’s a good app to begin with, I thought this feature was worth pointing out.
* I know that there are a lot of people that feel like me, and wish that there was a built-in complication to display battery life of the paired iPhone, but there isn’t. Fortunately, this is a pretty good work-around until such a thing comes to fruition.
* MacID for iOS is available for $0.99 on the App Store. Given the app’s primary functionality, which I find to work well, I think it’s worth the asking price. What say you?
* Here are some other iPhone battery monitoring apps that you can try:
