* Apple’s ongoing Education media event located at NYC’s Guggenheim Museum is all about learning, and facing the challenges in the field of education today.
* Apple unveiled some slides that paint a pretty startling picture about the state of the United States’ educational system when compared to other places in the world, citing overflowing class sizes and lack of enough textbooks, among other dire problems.
* With all of this in mind, Apple is trying to help — and it’s no surprise that the iPad is at the center of two initiatives — one of them is to reinvent textbooks. iBooks 2 is at the center of the reinvention process…

* “If you’re a freshman, you only have a 70% chance of graduating.”
* “These teachers need help — we try to figure out what we can do at Apple to help.”
* It looks like Apple is really serious about improving the education system in the United States, and eventually worldwide with iBooks 2. This looks extremely promising, and no doubt harkens back to Steve Jobs’ wishes of doing more for education through technology.
* All of this is pretty impressive, don’t you think?
