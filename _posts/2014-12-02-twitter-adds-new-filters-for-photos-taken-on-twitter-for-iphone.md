* Twitter announced on Tuesday it has begun rolling out new photo filters for its Twitter for iPhone app, in a continued effort to draw attention away from Facebook-owned Instagram. 
* The new filters should appear soon to add a little more character to your photos. Or just ruin them, if you overdo it.
* Furthermore, the update also adds the ability to swipe left and right between filters to pick the perfect one. You can now change the strength of them through a nifty new slider bar, as well.

* Twitter’s photo capabilities also allow you to crop and automatically enhance your photos for sharing.
