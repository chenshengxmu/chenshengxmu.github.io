* The Wallpapers of the Week section strives to bring you fresh images to your iOS devices every Sunday. Changing wallpapers is one of the quickest and most drastic ways to modify the look and feel of your daily driver, without a jailbreak. Consequently, having an arsenal of top quality images is key for every advanced user.
* Trying to provide a smattering of all wallpaper types, today’s images are simply textured. No cityscapes, naturescapes, or galaxy images, download simple textured wallpapers for iPhone.
* The first set of images, containing the marble wallpapers, is designed by Jason Zigrino, who is a long time friend of iDB. You can find more images by following him on Twitter via @JasonZigrino or visiting his dribbble gallery. All of the images are formatted for iPhone and can be downloaded by clicking the thumbnail.
