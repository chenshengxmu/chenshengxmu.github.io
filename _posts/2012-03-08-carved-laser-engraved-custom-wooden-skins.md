* You know I’m not really fond of cases or skins, but I never miss an occasion to check a new one out, especially when it’s made to order. The folks over at Carved sent me a couple custom iDB skins a while ago and today I’d like to show you what it looks like.
* Carved is a relatively new company that sells laser engraved wooden skins for iPhone, iPad and other devices. You can choose from a selection of skins for iPhone or for iPad, or even better, you can design your own custom skin to be laser engraved…
* The result looks pretty good. I’ll be the first to admit that engraving the iDB logo on your skin might not be the best use of it, but your options are virtually unlimited regarding to what you can get engraved. Of course, we’d be very proud if you decided to get an iDB logo.
* Not only you can choose what you want to get engraved, but you can also choose from a selection of 7 different types of wood, ranging from bamboo to sycamore.
* And some of these back panels you can make look absolutely gorgeous. See it for yourself!
* Naturally, because it is wood, it adds a little weight and thickness to your device. While it’s not really bad, I’m sure that some of you might not like the extra feel it brings to your iPhone or iPad.
* Starting at $19 for a simple wooden slate, prices go up to $39 for a custom laser engraved skin. Originality has a price, and you can figure out what it would cost you on Carved’s website.
* The company was nice enough to send me an extra wooden skin with iDB’s logo engraved on it to give away to one lucky reader. To enter, simply hit the “retweet” button and share this post on Twitter. We’ll select a winner tomorrow.
* Update: We picked a winner! And the winner is…. <drumroll> Dennis Rigdon. We’ll DM you to get your mailing address so we can ship this beautiful skin over to you. For everybody else, thanks for playing. We’ll have many more giveaways soon, so stay tuned.
