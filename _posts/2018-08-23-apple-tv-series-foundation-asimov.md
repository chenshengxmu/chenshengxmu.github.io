* It’s official. Nearly five months after it was first reported that Apple was working on a television series based on Isaac Asimov’s Foundation science fiction novels comes word that a full series order has been placed. The series is being written by David Goyer (“The Dark Knight” and “Batman Begins”) and Josh Friedman (“Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.”) Asimov’s daughter, Robyn Asimov, will serve as an executive producer alongside Skydance Television’s David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Marcy Ross, according to Ars Technica.
* First written as a trilogy in the 1950s, the Foundation series returned with new books by Asimov the 1980s. The fictional stories take place over a thousand years and track a group of exiles who are fighting against the Galactic Empire. As the report rightly explains, the books are considered an influential work of science fiction and have had an impact on many over the years films including “Star Wars” and “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”
* In recent years, others have attempted to bring the Foundation series to television, including “Independence Day” director Roland Emmerich and “Westworld’s” Jonathan Nolan.
* Isaac Asimov died in 1992.
* Since last year, Apple has spent millions of dollars on original TV programs that are likely to launch on a new video streaming service starting next year. Between now and 2022, the company is expected to spend $4.2 billion on programming to compete with companies like Amazon and Netflix.
* Earlier today, Aug. 23, we published a running list of Apple TV series now in development. Among the stars attached to the many titles are Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Octavia Spencer.
