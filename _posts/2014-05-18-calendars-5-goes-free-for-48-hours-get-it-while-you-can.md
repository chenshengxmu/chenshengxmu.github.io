* When Calendars 5 came out back in September of last year, we called it one of the best calendar apps for iOS. At the regular price of $6.99, it was a no-brainer for people looking for a powerful alternative to the stock calendar app, but it was a purchase hard to justify to people who don’t necessarily need a better calendar.
* As of today, price will not be an issue as Calendars 5 is going free for the next 48 hours or so. Our advice, you might have figured it out by now, is to grab this app while you can…
* Calendars 5 is a smart calendar and a task-manager. It seamlessly syncs with iCal and Google Calendars. All tasks from Reminders are also supported. One of the best features of Calendars 5 is natural language support: simply type or say “Meet Jim tomorrow at Starbucks at 4 P.M”. Calendars 5 will parse this and will create an event at given time, send the invite to a person and pick a place on a Google or Apple map.
* Download Calendars 5 in the App Store for free. If you want to explore your options, make sure to check out our list of best calendar apps for iPhone.
