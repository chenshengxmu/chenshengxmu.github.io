* A pair of photographs of excellent quality were published Wednesday morning by the increasingly reliable French blog NowhereElse.fr, seemingly picturing a purported rear shell of a sixth-generation full-size iPad. The device, which Apple will probably call the iPad Air 2, should be unveiled in October.
* The rumor-mill hasn’t leaked many iPad Air 2 parts so this particular component offers an insight into some of the minor design tweaks.
* For starters, the volume buttons are said to be inset in a recess. Also, a hole for the microphone on the back is now positioned alongside the camera rather than being centered on the top.
* The device’s interior appears to be revised slightly, too.
* NowhereElse.fr claims [Google Translate] it’s been able to get hold of these high-quality images from an unknown source. Here’s a look at the assumed rear panel with the Apple logo cutout and the camera/mic holes next to each other.

* And another look at the interior layout.

* The previously leaked iPad Air 2 components include Touch ID, SIM trays, the power/sleep button, GPS antenna, a mic and Wi-Fi module, to mention but a few.
* If history is an indication, Apple will unveil the new iPads at a media event in October.
* The rumor-mill is praying for the Touch ID sensor, a faster A8 chip with 2GB of RAM, improvements to the cameras, anti-reflection coating on the display for better readability outdoors, light changes in the device’s appearance and more.
* The video below highlights some of the possible design changes.
* Yesterday, Bloomberg revived a rumor that Apple was readying a brand new 12.9-inch iPad model for release later this year. Bloomberg’s sources privy to the matter are adamant that Apple is now shooting for an early-2015 release as production of the device is scheduled to begin by the first quarter of next year.
* It’s not surprising that Apple is looking to shake up the iPad lineup: last quarter, the firm sold 13.2 million iPads versus the 14.4 million expected. It was the second quarter in a row to have come slightly below expectations concerning iPad numbers.
* In a brief interview with Re/code reporter and columnist Walt Mossberg, Apple’s boss Tim Cook said that any slowdown in iPad sales should be interpreted as just a “speed bump”.
* “We couldn’t be happier with how we’ve done with the first four years of the iPad,“ Cook told Mossberg and added that, “I’d call what’s going on recently a speed bump, and I’ve seen that in every category.”
