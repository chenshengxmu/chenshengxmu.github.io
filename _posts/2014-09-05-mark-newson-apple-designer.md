* Vanity Fair is reporting this afternoon that world-famous designer Marc Newson will be joining Apple’s design team. His exact role is unknown at this time, but he will be working closely with long-time friend Jony Ive, and his design team, to help shape future products.
* The outlet says that Newson will continue to be based out of the United Kingdom, but he will frequently travel to Cupertino. The designer has in the past collaborated with Ive on design work for Apple, but today’s announcement makes his input and participation official.

* “Marc is without question one of the most influential designers of this generation,” Ive told Vanity Fair. “He’s extraordinarily talented. We are particularly excited to formalize our collaboration as we enjoy working together so much and have found our partnership so effective.”
* “I’m full of admiration and respect for the extraordinary design work that has been produced by Jony and the team at Apple,” Newson said. “My close friendship with Jony has not only given me a unique insight into that process, but the opportunity to work together with him and the people that have been responsible. I am enormously proud to join them.”
* Like Ive, Marc Newson has had his work archived by MoMA, and has been commissioned by several prominent companies including Ford, Nike, and Qantas Airways. Apple fans will recognize him as Ive’s partner in designing specialty items for Sotheby’s big Product Red charity auction last fall.
* Apple has made a number high-profile hires over the past two years, including former Burberry C.E.O Angela Ahrendts, Yves Saint Laurent’s Paul Deneve, and Nike’s Ben Shaffer. It also recently acquired Beats Electronics, along with their two hot shot executives Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.
