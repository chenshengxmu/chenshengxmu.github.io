* Apple’s annual Back to School promotion launched today in Australia and New Zealand, as noted by 9to5Mac. Unlike last year when the promo included iTunes gift cards, this time around Apple Store gift cards are being offered to university students, students accepted to a university and parents buying for a university student.
* A qualifying Mac, iPad or iPhone purchased is required.
* The sale runs from January 30 through March 19.
* In addition to the usual education pricing on Macs and iPads (but not on iPhones), buying a MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac or Mac Pro for university gets you a A$100/NZ$125 Apple Store gift card.
* An iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPad Air or iPad Air 2 will net you A$50/NZ$65 gift card. Getting an iPad mini, iPad mini 2 or iPad mini 3 will net you a A$25/NZ$30 gift card.
* Your gift card is redeemable against product purchases at Apple’s brick-and-mortar and online stores. Refurbished products do not qualify for this promotion.
* If past years are anything to go by, expect the promo to go live in the United States in early July, with the sale running from July through September.
* Customers in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom can also expect to take advantage of the Back to School promotion sometime later this year.
