* Apple introduced its Find My Friends application alongside iOS 5 late last year. The program is somewhat of a social network, allowing users to share their current locations with friends and family.
* As most of you know, the Find My Friends software enables you to literally locate your friends on a digital map. But what some of you may not have known, is that iPhone 4S owners can get a little help from Siri…
* If you already have the Find My Friends app, load it up and make sure that you are logged in. If you don’t already have it, you can download it from the App Store for free, and do the same.

* Once you’re logged in, you can exit the application and call up Siri. The command for locating a person is “Find Patty Mayonnaise.” Obviously you would substitute the name of the person you are looking for. “Where is Patty Mayonnaise?” is also an acceptable command. If Siri can’t locate the person, it’s because you either haven’t added them to your Find My Friends account or they’re not currently sharing their location.
* While this tip may not be for everyone, those who use the Find My Friends service frequently will find this to be much more efficient than tapping through the application.
* Do you use the Find My Friends app?
