* Developer The Iconfactory updated Twitterrific for iPhone, iPad and Mac this past weekend.
* The updates are available in Twitterrific’s iOS and macOS versions, bringing several new features. Most notably, users of the app can now finally attach a photo or video when sending direct messages, which is one of the longstanding features of Twitter’s official app.
* To attach a photo/video from your Mac to a Twitter direct message, hit a new camera icon in the direct message composer to pick a media file to attach. The recipient can tap/click an attached item in a direct message to have it displayed in the media viewer.
* On iPad, you can drag-and-drop a file onto the text area from another app. On iOS, long-pressing the camera icon automatically attaches your most recent photo or brings up a media picker so you can choose a file from another source.
* To remove the attached item, click on its thumbnail.
* You can, of course, also paste an image from the system clipboard using the standard Command (⌘)-V keyboard shortcut. Plus, there’s now a new Command (⌘)-D keyboard shortcut available in iOS/macOS apps for quickly sending a direct message to the tweet’s author.
* If you use Twitterrific’s excellent muffle feature, you’ll be pleased to learn that your suggested muffle rules on a tweet now include relevant deactivated rules across iOS and macOS apps.
* The Mac version has received a few other enhancements:
* The following bugs have been squashed in Twitterrific:
* Twitterrific for iOS recently picked up support for drag and drop on iPad, haptics, chronological threads, a new unread indicator, a black theme for iPhone X and other updates.
* The Mac app got refreshed recently with multi-account capabilities.
* Twitterrific for iOS is fully optimized for iPhone X and includes a Dark Mode-like theme. To make the most of your new iPhone X’s gorgeous OLED display in Twitterrific, tap your avatar to open the sidebar, then choose the option Appearance Preferences at the bottom center. Tap the Dark Theme button then select Black and you’re good to go.
