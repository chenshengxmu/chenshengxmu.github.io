* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the sole supplier of Apple’s new A11 processor, recently kicked off mass production of the upcoming chip and last week leak aggregator SlashLeaks posted a pair of blurry images claiming to depict the new processor.
* We, of course, can’t vouch for the authenticity of the spy shots.
* If you ask me, the photos could be fake. Why else would anyone bring a phone camera from 1998 to snap a blurry photo of the supposed iPhone 8 chip if not to obfuscate any markings?
* TSMC reportedly fabricates the A11 processor on its new ten-nanometer FinFET process.
* TSMC’s device packaging techniques that allow for a smaller overall package and reduced power consumption while bringing higher-width memory buses have reportedly impressed Apple so much that they awarded the foundry an exclusive contract to build the new A11 chip.
* With an official iPhone 8 introduction but a few weeks away, we’re now at long last starting to see some component leaks. The claimed parts for Apple’s radically redesigned OLED iPhone that have trickled out of assembly plants thus far include an inductive wireless charging printed circuit board, an OLED display assembly as well as Lightning and power flex cables.
