* This week was an improvement over last week in terms of jailbreak tweak release volume in Cydia, but things are still slow as we continue to go on without a jailbreak for iOS 10, Apple’s latest mobile operating system.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all of this week’s jailbreak tweak releases, starting by showcasing our favorites and then talking about the rest afterwards.
* NotificationPop – FREE

* NotificationPop is a tweak that makes launching banner notifications a lot easier on larger-screened devices.
* With it, you can use a 3D Touch gesture anywhere on the display to easily launch a notification that appears at the top of the device. With that, you will no longer have to reach your short fingers all the way up to the top of that plus-sized iPhone you’re using.
* You can read more about NotificationPop in our full review.
* Google Maps – No Location Services Alert: Prevents a nagging alert in Google Maps when location access is revoked (free – review)
* Notifications10: Brings iOS 10-style notifications to jailbroken iOS 9 devices ($0.99 – review)
* That wraps it up for this week. If you’re interested in seeing more jailbreak tweak releases, you can look at last week’s roundup and stay tuned to iDB for the latest jailbreak tweak releases in the future.
