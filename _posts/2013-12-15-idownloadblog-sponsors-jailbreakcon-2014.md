* I am happy to report that for the third year, iDownloadBlog is an official media sponsor of WWJC, the first (and so far only) major event dedicated to jailbreaking.
* Just like the first edition of the event, WWJC 2014 will be held in San Francisco. If the location of the event is a sure thing, the date is still pending, but we’re being told it could happen around April or May.
* The date options are actually interesting…
* From a hopeful stand point, the April/May timeframe could indicate that a jailbreak for iOS 7 will be available before then. When you think about it, it wouldn’t make much sense to have a jailbreak event with no jailbreak available. Of course this is just rumors at this point, but the timing sure is interesting.
* I’m personally happy to see the event back in San Francisco. Not only it’s closer to home, but more importantly, it’s closer to many developers and hackers, making it easier for them to attend.
* Although no one has been confirmed yet, it’s safe to assume the usual suspects will be there: Saurik, planetbeing, P0sixninja, etc… We’ll make sure to publish updates about speakers and schedules as we learn more.
* If you haven’t yet, I invite you to read my tale of the first JailbreakCon event. It’s a fun read, believe me.
* Who’s planning on going?
