* At 12:01am PT Apple started taking pre-orders for the Apple Watch models through its online store and the Apple Store iOS shopping app. If you’ve managed to reserve your device for in-store pickup or home delivery on April 24, consider yourself lucky.
* As MacRumors points out, pre-order shipping estimates for many Watch models have slipped to 4-6 weeks or later in less than six hours, with some models such as the 42mm Black Link Bracelet now set to ship in July. This means folks who just woke up and pre-ordered the device won’t get it until late next month or June.
* As of this writing, the online US Apple Store provided the following pre-order shipping estimates for various models:
* This wasn’t entirely unexpected.
* Yesterday, Apple via a press release said it’ll be taking pre-orders for the device exclusively through the Online Apple Store and via the Apple Store shopping app “during the initial launch period,” arguing that “strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch”.
* It’s unclear what exactly is “the initial launch period” and when walk-in purchases might be possible. The device can be pre-ordered in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
* Both in-store pickup and home delivery options are available, with the former being available only to customers residing within the United States. Try-on appointments are available starting today.
* Did you pre-order a Watch and which model did you get?
