* The iPhone 4 is no slouch when it comes to taking decent point and shoot snapshots, and 720p video, but it definitely falls behind dedicated point and shoots.
* Recently, we’ve heard rumblings that the iPhone 5’s camera sensor could be bumped up from 5 Megapixels to 8 Megapixels.
* As it turns out, OmniVision — provider of many of the previous iPhone camera sensors — has come up with an improved method of gaining higher pixel density while taking up the same amount of space.
* That would make it a no-brainer that Apple would use this upgraded sensor in the iPhone’s annual refresh, but it looks like there may have been a slight change of plans…
* In the past week, shares of OmniVision stock took a hit amidst rumors that the company has lost the bid to supply their sensors for the iPhone 5.
* The fallout apparently occurred due to the fact that OmniVision won’t have enough supply of the new sensors to meet what Apple is demanding.
* In light of these recent revelations, Apple looks like it could be linking up with an unlikely partner in Sony to supply its iPhone 5 camera sensors.
* Sony already makes high-end 8 Megapixel sensors for their Xperia Pro phones, and word on the street is that they go toe-to-toe with OmniVision’s offerings.
* The good news for OmniVision is that their stock did indeed recover quite nicely due to its strong Q3 results.
* Unfortunately, if the news surrounding the iPhone 5 is true, the company could be in for some rough waters ahead.
* What do you think about the possibility of Sony supplying the iPhone 5’s camera sensor?
