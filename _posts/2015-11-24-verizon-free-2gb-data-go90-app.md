* Heads up Verizon Wireless customers, the carrier is currently offering a limited-time promotion that awards free data to those on its More Everything plan. The promo is good for an extra 2GB for three months, and all you have to do to take advantage of it is download Verizon’s GO90 app.
* So for those of you on one of the aforementioned plans, grab GO90 from the App Store here or the Google Play Store here. Once it’s downloaded, you should receive a text message from Verizon telling you that the free data has been activated on your account, along with an expiration date.

* Of course, the free 2GB must be shared amongst all of the lines on your account, and you can only activate the promo once. But, the good news is that this deal is stackable with Verizon’s other free 1GB offer, meaning you could net yourself a total of an extra 3GB of data through the holidays.

* For those curious about GO90 app, it’s essentially the product of Verizon’s recent AOL purchase. You can use it to stream a wide variety of video content from major partners like MTV, Comedy Central, The Food Network, NFL and more, as well as cut your own clips and share them with friends.
* Again, the free 2GB offer is available for a limited time only. You can find the GO90 app in the App Store and Google Play Store for free.
* Thanks Mike!
