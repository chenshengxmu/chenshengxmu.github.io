* Apple announced its financial results for its fiscal third quarter of 2015 this afternoon, and the numbers are solid. The company sold 47.5 million iPhones and earned $49.6 billion in revenue, breaking June quarter records and beating Wall Street expectations.
* We just finished up the conference call, where Tim Cook and other executives discussed Apple’s performance over the three-month period, and offered up some insights into its future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points from the call below.
* Despite the solid quarter, shares of APPL dipped 7% in after-hours trading due to a small miss on iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected forecast for Q4. The dubiousness shouldn’t last long, however, as Apple is expected to introduce a wave of new products in the fall.
* If you want to listen to today’s earnings call, a replay will be available for a limited time.
