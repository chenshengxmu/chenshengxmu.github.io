* A new report is out this morning, claiming that Apple is preparing to push out an update for its internal POS (point of sale) system software later this month that will allow Apple Store shoppers to pay with Passbook.
* More specifically, the update will allow Apple’s retail employees to accept Apple Store payment cards via Passbook, the new digital wallet app in iOS 6 that stores boarding passes, event tickets and gift cards…
* 9to5Mac reports:
* “Later this month, Apple will be seeding an updated version of its mobile point-of-sale (EasyPay) system software to Apple Store employees. This update, numbered version 12.3, will allow retail employees with EasyPays to capture Apple Store payment card codes from customer iPhones and iPod touches running Passbook.”
* Currently, customers can use the Apple Store app to pay for accessories and other low-cost items by scanning the item’s bar code and logging into iTunes. The site says that the app is also likely to get an update soon to support Passbook.
* The difference here, is that Apple gift cards can handle payments much higher than an iTunes account transaction. So shoppers could presumably use the new Passbook method to pay for larger items like iPads and Mac computers.
* Apple’s new digital wallet has gotten off to a bit of a slow start, with only a handful of companies supporting the new app thus far. But the organizations that are using it, like the MLB, say that they are seeing impressive adoption rates.
