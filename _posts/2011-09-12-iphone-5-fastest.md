* In the ever-changing world of Android handsets, there has been one device that has consistently stood out among the crowd — The Samsung Galaxy S II. The phone has been dominating European sales charts for several months, and has recently landed stateside.
* Nearly 4 times as fast as the iPhone 4, the Galaxy S II’s processor/GPU combo is the fastest in the industry according to Anandtech. But how will the speediest smartphone in the business stack up against Apple’s yet-to-be-announced iPhone 5?
* 9to5Mac passes on Anandtech’s GL Benchmark results:
* “Samsung implemented a 4-core version of the Mali-400 in the 4210 and its resulting performance is staggering as you can see above. Although it’s still not as fast as the PowerVR SGX 543MP2 found in the iPad 2, it’s anywhere from 1.7 – 4x faster than anything that’s shipping a smartphone today.”
* Given the fact that Apple’s upcoming smartphone uses the same A5 chip found in the iPad 2, it’s safe to say that the Galaxy S II won’t be able to hold a candle to the iPhone 5’s speed. Notice that the S2 gets half the FPS (Frames Per Second) of Apple’s latest tablet.
* Of course, this is all still speculation at this point, as the iPhone 5 has not even been officially announced by Apple. But the company is expected to unveil the device within the next few weeks. And if there is one thing we are sure of, it’s going to be really, really fast.
* What do you think of the tests results? Does it renew your excitement for the iPhone 5?
