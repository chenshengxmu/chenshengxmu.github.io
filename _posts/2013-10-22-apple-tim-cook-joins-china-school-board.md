* As China becomes more important to Apple’s bottom line, the iPhone maker will need to grease the wheels to ensure products are timely approved. In a step in that direction, Apple CEO Tim Cook has joined the advisory board of a prestigious engineering university – which also happens to include a number of prominent Chinese politicians.
* Cook, who is also a Nike board member, has added his name to a panel assisting Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management (SEM), according to a report. As markets such as North America and Western Europe mature and growth slows, tech companies like Apple view China as a way to take up the slack…
* Among the board: Wang Qishan, Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; Chen Yuan, Vice Chairperson of the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC); Ma Kai, one of China’s four vice premiers; and Zhou Xiaochuan, Vice Chairman on the 12th National Committee of the CPPCC, according to TechCrunch.
* The list of Who’s Who doesn’t stop there.
* Terry Ghou, founder and CEO of Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn is on the board, along with Qualcomm’s Irwin Mark Jacobs. US financial and corporate bigwigs are also represented: former US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, as well as Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott.
* Cook has used a hands-on policy when it comes to maintaining good ties with China.
* The Apple CEO has made multiple personal visits to China to shmooze with China Mobile executives. Cook also issued a personal apology to Chines consumers, a move that gained a positive response from that nation’s government.
