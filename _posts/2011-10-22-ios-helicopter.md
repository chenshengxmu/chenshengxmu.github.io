* Tired of flying animated helicopters and shooting digital missiles? Why not try the real thing? The folks behind the popular iHelicopter line just released a new iOS-controlled helicopter that is sure to cure your boredom.
* The new Cobra from iHelicopter comes complete with all of the typical RC helicopter features. It has a durable frame to prevent crash-damage, a self-stabilizer to help with flying, and oh yeah, two on-board launchable missiles…
* 9to5Mac points to the new iHelicopter that is sure to be on everyone’s wish list this holiday season. Don’t believe me? Watch this video (ignore the cheesy, possibly copyright-infringing Pirates of the Caribbean theme music):
* The onboard missiles can be fired from within the included iOS app, and have a range of about 6 feet. The helicopter itself has a control range between 30 and 45 feet. So you have quite a bit of room to play with.
* At $69.95, the Cobra actually seems like a pretty good deal. But it doesn’t come without its caveats. The helicopter takes about 45 minutes to charge, and its battery only lasts about 10 minutes. The transmitter has a charge and play time of 120 minutes.
* Still, if you’re looking for a helicopter that can be controlled with an iDevice and shoot missiles, iHelicopter’s Cobra might be your best bet. The Cobras are in stock and ready for order at iHelicopter’s online store.
* What do you think of the Cobra?
