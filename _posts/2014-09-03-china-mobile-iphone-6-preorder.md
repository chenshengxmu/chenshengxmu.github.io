* Apple’s next-generation smartphone hasn’t been announced yet, but that didn’t stop China Mobile from putting it up for sale. China Daily is reporting that the carrier, which is the largest in the world, has opened up preorders for the so-called iPhone 6.
* Since early yesterday, CM subscribers in Beijing have been able to reserve both a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone model. Details, such as prices and storage capacities are unknown, and customers are not being offered images of the handsets or release dates.
* China Mobile has in the past offered online reservations for unannounced Apple devices—last year it pulled a similar stunt with the iPhone 5s. It’s essentially a marketing campaign that helps drum up interest in both the carrier and major product launches.
* And it appears to be working. China Daily says that, as of Tuesday evening, more than 33,000 preorders had been placed. Again, the reservations are limited to Beijing customers, and they are not being given shipping dates or potential launch dates.
* Apple has a media event scheduled for next Tuesday, where it’s expected to unveil the iPhone 6. There’s no word yet on whether or not it, or any of its carrier partners, will offer preorders here in the US, but it’s believed the handset will go on sale mid-month.
