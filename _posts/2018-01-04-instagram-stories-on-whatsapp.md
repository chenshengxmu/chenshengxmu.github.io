* Instagram has begun allowing some users to cross-post their Stories to WhatsApp, reports TechCrunch. The Facebook-owned company has confirmed to the site that it’s testing a new feature that allows users to post their Instagram Stories to WhatsApp as a Status.
* For those who aren’t familiar with WhatsApp, your Status is a Snapchat-like feature where decorated photos, videos and GIFs can be posted and set to self-destruct after 24 hours. Anything you post can be encrypted, and it looks like Instagram Stories can be as well.

* Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, so the cross-posting move makes sense. It helps legitimize the relatively new WhatsApp Status feature and increases engagement with Instagram Stories, which already has 300+ million daily active users.
* “We are always testing ways to improve the experience on Instagram and make it easier to share any moment with the people who matter to you,” a spokesperson told Tech Crunch. They didn’t say, however, when (or if) the feature would be released to the public.
