* Earlier today, we told you that the Chronic Dev Team was reporting that Absinthe, the first iPhone 4S-compatible jailbreaking utility, was downloaded more than 1 million times last Friday. That’s huge.
* And the Dev Team seems to back up that theory with a new blog post entitled “Welcome new A5 jailbreakers!” The post breaks down how many people installed Cydia over the weekend, and on what devices…
* “Here’s a quick breakdown of how many A5 owners have jailbroken their devices since Friday morning. The numbers as of Monday afternoon are:
* Total: 953,232 new A5 jailbreaks in a little over 3 days.
* The reason these numbers can be so precise is that one of the housekeeping activities that happens when you launch Cydia is a query to @saurik’s server for the list of available SHSH blobs. (Even if you have none on file, the query is still made).”
* So around 800,000 devices were jailbroken this weekend for the first time. That’s pretty cool.
* If you are new to the jailbreaking scene, make sure to check out some of our favorite tweaks. We have lists for both the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S, as well as utilities specifically designed for Siri. And new content is added daily.
