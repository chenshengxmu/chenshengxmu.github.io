* Alongside a new iPad Air, Apple has today unveiled a new version of its iPad mini. But unlike it’s larger sibling, the mini does not receive a performance bump courtesy of the new A8X chip, the 8MP iSight camera or many of the other improvements.
* As you can see in the image above, the tablet retains its 7.9-inch display and 5MP iSight camera. On the other hand, it does gain the faster 802.11n with MIMO and a Touch ID-enabled Home button. Apple didn’t mention the name of its processor.
* Like last year, the mini announcement felt a bit like an afterthought. After spending 15+ minutes talking about the Air, Phil Schiller said “and we’ve also got an update for the iPad mini,” posted the above slide for a few seconds, and then moved passed it.

* At any rate, if you’re interested, you can pick up the new iPad mini 3 starting at the same price as last year, $399 for the 16GB model. As with iPhones, Apple has dropped the 32GB option, forcing you to choose between 16GB or the more expensive 64GB option.
* Like the iPad Air 2, the iPad mini 3 will come in gold, and be available for pre-order beginning tomorrow. Apple is keeping both the iPad mini 2 (with Retina display) and original iPad mini in the lineup, with prices starting at $249 and $299 respectively.
