* Citing a person with knowledge of the matter, Reuters reported Thursday that there are at least five different groups within Apple working on wireless charging technologies ahead of iPhone 8. As we reported recently, the iPhone maker has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC).
* WPC is a multinational technology consortium which manages the popular interface standard Qi used for wireless charging across a number of products. The move gave credence to rumors that iPhone 8 may feature some sort of wireless charging.
* Many Android handsets feature wireless charging, but several underlying technologies have resulted in some incompatibilities. Samsung’s phones, for instance, feature wireless charging but support two different sets of standards, Qi and AirFuel.

* Japanese blog Mac Otakara said recently that wireless charging could be an optional feature of iPhone 8, requiring a dedicated wireless charger accessory. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that all 2017 iPhone models will feature wireless charging, not just iPhone 8.
