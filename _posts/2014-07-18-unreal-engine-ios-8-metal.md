* Though Metal isn’t among the headline user-facing features of iOS 8, its impact on games with snazzy visuals can’t be overstated.
* Introduced at WWDC 2014 alongside a number of other features aimed at developers, Metal is billed as a new graphics runtime that wants to replace OpenGL ES by trimming the fat to provide what Apple calls the lowest-overhead access to the A7 chip’s GPU.
* And now, Epic Games – which makes the tremendously popular and powerful graphics engine that powers many premium games – has announced that the latest version of Unreal Engine (version 4.3) adds Metal support…
* What’s in it for you?
* If you’re a gamer, expect a new breed of games for A7 devices like the iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display, games that will be way more detailed and a lot smoother.
* Epic advises developers to manually enable Metal in their game’s Project Settings and compile their code using the latest Xcode 6 beta.
* Unreal Engine 4.3 includes greatly improved mobile support, awesome new rendering features, improved Blueprint workflows, and strides toward an excellent experience on Mac and laptops.
* Be sure to check out the new World Composition tools, spline features, and the preview of Paper2D, our 2D toolset! Today we’re also shipping SpeedTree 7 support, our work on Metal API for iOS 8 to date, and new Oculus Rift features such as time warping.
* Epic demoed an upcoming Metal-enabled work-in-progress titles, Zen Garden, on-stage during the WWDC keynote.

* Launching later this Fall free of charge, Zen Garden showcases Metal’s capabilities by allowing for realistic interactions with water, sand, koi in a pond and more, with thousands of interactive objects being rendered simultaneously.
* As more and more developers embrace Metal, both games and graphics-heavy applications will be prettier because OpenGL, currently used for mobile game development across many platforms, just can’t provide the kind of low-level access to A7-specific hardware capabilities like Metal.
* As you can see, Metal is a technology Apple’s created to permit developers to maximize the graphics and compute potential of their iOS 8 apps.

* “With a streamlined API, precompiled shaders, and support for efficient multi-threading, Metal can take your game or graphics app to the next level of performance and capability,” writes Apple on the Metal mini-site.
* I can’t wait to see what developers accomplish with Metal.
* You?
