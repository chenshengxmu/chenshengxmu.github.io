* In California, which is where I live, we don’t get many changes in our weather conditions. Northern California summers reach just above 100 during the hottest days of August and right around 50 degrees during the coldest months in January. There are no tornadoes, hurricanes, or blizzards in my town, but for some reason, I Love weather apps. Maybe it is because I don’t experience extreme weather conditions, but want to see what they look like from above.
* If you are a weather watcher because you are preparing for the upcoming storm, or just like to see those red swirly radar signals moving around on a map, we have a handful of apps that we think are the best weather apps for iPhone…

* When you live in states that have actual rainfall (read: NOT California), you tend to be more in tune to the changing of the seasons and when winter is coming. This app provides detailed information about rain and snow over the next hour. If you want to run out to the store for a bag of chips, you can tell, minute-by-minute, whether you should grab your umbrella before you head out the front door. With advanced notifications, you’ll know when rain is predicted to fall soon. Plus, you can get severe weather alerts to keep you informed on where that storm will hit. It is also compatible with Apple Watch. This app is available for $3.99.

Nicely photographed landscapes with particular weather patterns are overlaid with useful information about the current and future weather patterns.

* Why settle for beautiful or informative when you can have an angry robot give you the forecast. CARROT has become somewhat of a celebrity over the past few years with a variety of helpful virtual assistant apps. With this one, you’ll get the weather report with a twist of sadistic humor. The app is part weather forecast and part game. The more you do in the app, the more secrets you will unlock. But, don’t let your guard down. That CARROT is a feisty one, and she hates meatbags.
