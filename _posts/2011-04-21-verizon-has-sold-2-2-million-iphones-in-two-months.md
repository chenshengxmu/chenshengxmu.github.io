* Following the heels of AT&T’s and Apple’s Q1 earnings call, Verizon has announced a rather impressive earnings report for Q1 of 2011. The Verizon iPhone has been available to consumers since February, and the industry was been waiting with eager anticipation for Verizon’s official word on its iPhone sales.
* Yesterday, AT&T announced 3.6 million iPhone activations on its network for Q1, and Verizon has announced a staggering 2.2 million iPhone activations since February. That means that Verizon is selling 1 million+ iPhones per month.

* Until today, Verizon had yet to give any indication of how well the iPhone was selling on its network. Speculation was that the device wasn’t doing that well, and AT&T’s Q1 results indicated that many people still chose the AT&T iPhone when given the opportunity.
* Verizon has surprised all of us with some rather impressive numbers for a device that’s barely a business quarter old.
* In Apple’s Q1 earnings report, the Cupertino company didn’t give any specific sales numbers for either carrier. Apple did say that AT&T and Verizon now account for a huge share of iPhone sales.
* It’s nice to see that both AT&T and Verizon can do well with the iPhone at the same time. This spring is sure to be interesting when the white iPhone 4 is introduced into the mix.
* Next year will be even more unpredictable. Will Apple release the iPhone 5 on both carriers? Will Verizon be on a later Apple release cycle than AT&T from now on?
* What do you think?
