* Luca Todesco has just posted the incomplete source code for his iOS 10.2 Yalu jailbreak to Github. Bear in mind, this is only an initial commit and does not even contain the entirety of the code, including patches, which will be required for the final product.
* The code appears quite similar to the initial build of the tool we saw a month or so back, which supported only iOS 10(.1(.1)). Todesco subsequently stated that his fix for the instability of that beta tool would also provide support for iOS 10.2, on all devices except the iPhone 7(+).
* Whilst it is encouraging to see a commit of the code, which presumably implies that work continues on the project, it is far too early to start getting excited about this development. As stated, the code is incomplete in device support, iOS version support, and actual jailbreak content, and is intended for developers to peruse only.
* The code of the jailbreak is attributed to Luca Todesco, and Marco Grassi of the outfit Keen Lab. We’ll keep you up to date with the progress of the project on Github as the commits roll in and when any major development occurs. In the meantime, remain calm and do not hassle the developers.
* I would also advise against trying to make use of the project, unless you really know what you’re doing, as it is fundamentally unfinished at present and will certainly not run for you in any helpful way.
* Remember: the posting of the code is not an admission of a release date, nor of anything else, and its clearly unfinished state should be enough to put an end to the questions about its progress for now. However, it’s heartening to see something concrete, so let’s just wait and see how it develops in the coming weeks.
