* As expected, Apple took the wraps off the latest iteration of its mobile operating system last week. And although it may not be quite the upgrade that its predecessor was, iOS 6 still includes a ton of new features and other enhancements.
* We’ve covered a number of these additions here on iDB already, but it’s hard to keep up with each and every new discovery. So, we’ve decided to put together a census of all of the new changes. Here’s iDB’s ultimate list of new iOS 6 features…
* Note: Some of them are device-specific, so make sure to check out our feature compatibility guide for more information.
* The Phone app gets a slight upgrade in iOS 6 with a new look, and at least one significant enhancement:
* iOS 6 includes deep, system-level Facebook integration:
* The video calling app gets two welcome new features in iOS 6:
* Siri receives quite the upgrade in iOS 6, with the ability to answer a number of new questions, and perform new tasks:
* The Maps app has been completely redesigned from the ground up in iOS 6. And not only does it look different, but it also has a handful of new features:
* The Clock app in iOS 6 gets a minor new feature, and a fresh coat of paint for Apple’s tablet:
* Safari didn’t get quite the makeover that other apps did, but it did receive a couple of nice enhancements:
* There aren’t many new features in the Photos app in iOS 6, but there are a few notable changes:
* Passbook is a brand new application in iOS 6 that organizes all of a user’s digital gift cards, event tickets and boarding passes. Cards are location-aware, so if a user approaches a building connected with one of the cards in their Passbook app, they receive a push notification.
* The new Mail application in iOS 6 is exactly like the old one, but with the addition of a few handy features:
* After nearly four years without any major changes, the App Store gets a significant redesign in iOS 6, as do the iBook and iTunes stores. They look different, act different, and make browsing through content more enjoyable. Oh, and you don’t get kicked out of the app when you start a download anymore.
* Apple made a few changes to the Settings app in iOS 6 in order to keep up with the other new features.
* Other than the above-mentioned features and enhancements, there are a few other changes in iOS 6 worth pointing out:
* We plan to continue to add to this list as more new features come to light. But if you feel like we’ve missed something, be sure to let us know about it in the comments below and we’ll add it.
* So, what do you think of iOS 6 so far?
