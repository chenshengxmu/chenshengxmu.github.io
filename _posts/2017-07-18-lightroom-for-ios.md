* Adobe today updated Lightroom for iPhone and Lightroom for iPad on App Store with some key new features aimed at making editing on the go easier than ever. You can now use a new brush feature to selectively paint in enhancements to any part of your images.
* The selective brush option extends to the eraser tool, allowing you to selectively erase both the linear and radial gradients. And if your device has 3D Touch, like iPhone 6s or iPhone 7, you can even vary the effect by just pressing softer or harder as you paint.

* iPad Pro users working with an Apple Pencil get the same pressure-sensing to apply more or less of the effect. You’ll also notice a new Details tab within the app where you can add the finishing touches to images by controlling noise and enhancing image details.
* The in-app camera now supports a new Show Highlight Clipping feature that shows you the over-exposed areas prior to capture, which lets you adjust the exposure or composition in camera. Lightroom for iOS also packs in an improved virtual level via the in-app camera with haptic feedback and support for latest cameras and lenses.

* Last but not least, Lightroom for iPad now features a revamped interface, shown top of post, designed for the tablet’s larger canvas. According to Adobe, the app makes editing via iPad a serious option as a laptop replacement for any photographer.
