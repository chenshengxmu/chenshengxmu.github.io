* Episode 53: We went to JailbreakCon to talk to some of the mainstays of the jailbreak community. Inside, we talk to Surenix, Ryan Petrich, and pod2g about any and all things related to jailbreaking. You’ll learn about the development and design process of Auki from Surenix, Ryan Petrich’s mindset when it comes to developing new tweaks, and pod2g talks about the inner-workings of the evad3rs jailbreak dream team. pod2g also answers the question that we’ve all been wanting to hear—will they release an iOS 7.1 jailbreak?
