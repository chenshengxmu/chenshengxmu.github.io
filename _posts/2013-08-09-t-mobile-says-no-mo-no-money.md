* If you were planning to pickup an iPhone 4S or 5 on T-Mobile anytime soon, you better act fast. According to a new report, the carrier is ending its popular ‘$0 down’ promotion on the two handsets that it just started in late July.
* The deal, which is said to be ending tomorrow for the aforementioned models, allowed new T-Mobile subscribers to purchase an iPhone with no downpayment, and monthly payments of around $25 until the phone was paid for…
* But starting tomorrow, the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5 will revert to T-Mobile’s original pricing: up to $145 up front (for iPhone 5) and 24 monthly payments of $21. Deals on the iPhone 4 and other smartphones will still be available.
* AllThingsD confirmed the news with the carrier:
* “T-Mobile confirmed to AllThingsD that, starting Saturday, neither device will be available as part of that promotion. (The iPhone 4 will still be available for no money down.)
* “As is the nature of promotions, pricing moves are temporary,” a T-Mobile representative toldAllThingsD.”
* Folks still looking to score a deal on an iPhone 5 can still head over to their local Best Buy this weekend. The retailer is running a few promotions of its own—one of which is knocking $100 off Sprint-flavored iPhone 5 32GB models.
