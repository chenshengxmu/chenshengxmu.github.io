* Spark, Readdle’s excellent iPhone app for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud and other email services, is now compatible with iOS 9 features, including 3D Touch on new iPhones.
* Spark 1.2 for iPhone also includes the ability to select any email account or alias as default FROM: address for new emails. The app now lets you customize canned replies to your liking and includes a host of other improvements.
* As mentioned, Spark’s built-in canned responses, called Quick Replies, can now be fully customized. You can add or remove them as you like, or create new ones to fit your productivity workflow.

* Best of all, these Quick Replies carry over to Spark’s Apple Watch app, making it even easier to reply to emails from your wrist with pre-made responses. If you don’t like Quick Replies, you can disable them in settings.
* You can now select your default email account that the app will use to send new emails from, as shown below. The default FROM: account can be selected in Mail Accounts → Default Email Address within Spark’s settings.

* A pair of new options are also available to better control how your email workflow works. For instance, you can now tell the app to return to the main email list when a message is archived or deleted. Previously, the app would open the next email in your list.

* Another new option lets you enable both Archive and Delete toolbar buttons, or choose to enable only one of these. The new email workflow options are available under the new Email Viewer section within Spark’s settings.

* Last but not least, Spark will no longer overwhelm your calendar view as you can now selectively show or hide specific calendars by tapping on Spark’s calendar icon in the toolbar and then hitting the new List button in the upper right corner of the interface.
* For those wondering, the Spark team is working around the clock to bring you even more features, including full Exchange support, new localizations, an iPad edition and—yes—a Mac edition of Spark.
