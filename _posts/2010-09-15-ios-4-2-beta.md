* Apple just released iOS 4.2 Beta to developers. As 9 to 5 Mac noted, it’s not only available for iPhones as you can also download iOS 4.2 Beta for iPad, which will bring over-the-air printing.
* As usual when a new firmware comes out, it is recommended that jailbreakers and unlockers stay away from it if they don’t want to lose the ability to jailbreak/unlock in the future…
* The official iOS 4.2 release is scheduled for November for both the iPhone and the iPad. You can download iOS 4.2 beta from here, assuming you have a developer account.
