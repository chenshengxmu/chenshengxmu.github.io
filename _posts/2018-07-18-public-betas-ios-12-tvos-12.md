* Apple has introduced all-new public betas for iOS 12 and tvOS 12. You must be a member of the Apple Beta Software program to receive the updates.
* The new iOS 12 public beta 3 and tvOS 12 public beta 3 arrive nearly two weeks after the previous version and just days after similar developer betas were released.
* Both iOS 12 and tvOS 12 should arrive for the general public this fall along with next-generation versions of macOS and watchOS.
