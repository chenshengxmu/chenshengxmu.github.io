* Amazon has gone on the offensive in the company’s battle for tablet supremacy by taking a price-powered swipe at its only real competition – the iPad.
* The ad, which follows similar Kindle ads we have seen by showing a young lady in a bikini reading a book, shows both the new Kindle e-reader and the Android-powered Kindle Fire in use, while taking a stab at the iPad’s lofty price.
* Needless to say Amazon’s iPad alternatives come up trumps in the new 30-second spot, with one poor chap finding himself shot down in more than one way when he approaches the woman in question…
* The whole story revolves around our intrepid iPad-toting fellow approaching a lady holding a Kindle. When he mentions that she cannot watch video on her device she points to her two children, both using a new Kindle Fire. The woman then proudly exclaims that all three Kindles added together still cost less than the one iPad, at which point the poor guy beats a hasty retreat.
* With the standard Kindle retailing at $79 and a Kindle Fire setting punters back $199, the ad is indeed accurate. Coming in at $357 for two Kindles and a Kindle Fire, the trifecta of Kindle goodness weighs in a good $42 less than the cheapest iPad.
* While possibly not telling the whole story, the ad is certainly compelling for those with families and in need of multiple machines. Throw in an e-ink display-equipped Kindle and you’re set for most uses.
* We always knew the Kindle Fire’s best bet was to push its price advantage, and it didn’t take Amazon to get to the same way of thinking. We agree that the iPad and Kindle Fire are two very different beasts, but money talks in these tough times.
* Would you consider picking three devices up for less than one iPad?
