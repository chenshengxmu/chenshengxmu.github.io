* A new OS X extension from Hasbrang Productions, the prominent jailbreak community development team, makes it easy to open and switch a new Terminal window to the current working directory, right from the Finder’s contextual menu.
* Available at no charge on the Mac App Store, the aptly named TermHere installs itself as a Finder file extension, readily accessible from the right-click menu. It works as advertised and is pretty convenient, more so if you use Terminal frequently.
* After downloading the app from the Mac App Store, make sure that TermHere is enabled in the Extensions preferences: go to System Preferences → Extensions, click Finder in the lefthand column and then tick the checkbox next to “TermHere Finder Extension”.

* You can now navigate to any folder in the Finder and quickly open a new Terminal window with the working directory automatically set to that folder: just right-click inside the current Finder window, then select New Terminal Here from the contextual menu.

* You can also select a folder in the Finder and then right-click. Either way, a Terminal window opens with the working directory set to the selected folder. The extensions is available even if you right-click the files inside an app bundle or other Finder bundles.

* If you select multiple directories, each one will be opened in its own tab. If you select one or more files, the directory that contains the item(s) will be used instead.
* It’s a pretty straightforward app that will save you some typing in Terminal, and it certainly doesn’t hurt that it’s provided at no charge. Developers in particular will find that jumping from a Finder window to a Terminal window in the same directory is a breeze with TermHere.
* Changing the working directory of a Terminal window can be manually accomplished by typing the “cd ” command (with the space included) and then dropping any folder on the Finder window, which’ll automatically add the full file path to the command.
* If you don’t use Terminal, you can set TermHere to use any other command-line app on your computer, like iTerm2. Some apps like Cathode and MacTerm do not support being opened by other apps and as such won’t work with TermHere.

* TermHere requires an Intel-based Mac with a 64-bit Intel processor and OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later. The app is currently English-only.
* Download TermHere at no charge from the Mac App Store.
