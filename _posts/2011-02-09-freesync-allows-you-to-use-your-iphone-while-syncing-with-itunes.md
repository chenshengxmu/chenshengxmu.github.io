title: FreeSync Allows You to Use Your iPhone While Syncing With iTunes

* If the story sounds familiar, that’s because it is. You want to be able to use your iPhone while synching with iTunes, so what do you do?
* You jailbreak your iPhone, and install one of two tweaks: Synchronicity or FreeSync. Both tweaks do a good job at allowing you chug away at your iPhonely duties while syncing with iTunes, and both are similarly priced.
* With that in mind, which jailbreak tweak should you go with? We’ve already covered Synchronicity — a tweak that made it into our Top 10 Jailbreak Apps for 2010 list — so lets look at the flipside of the coin with FreeSync…
* While I for one admire the set-it-and-forget-it nature of Synchronicity, I have to give props where props are due. FreeSync is a much deeper tweak if you’re looking for something a bit more fleshed out.
* It includes various notification options, and the ability to enable and disable the tweak right from the Settings.app. Synchronicity features no settings section, so it’s either installed and working, or not.
* One thing that I like in particular about FreeSync is the ability to disable potential database damaging apps altogether.

* For instance, with Synchronicity if you open the iPod app, the tweak will recognize it and your sync will come to an abrupt halt. With FreeSync, you can simply disable those apps during the sync outright, so there’s no chance of complications.
* Either way, both tweaks do a very good job at freeing up your iPhone during syncing time. Synchronicity fits the bill in most circumstances, but power users will definitely want to take a look at FreeSync.
* FreeSync is a jailbreak tweak available for jailbroken iPhones and can be purchased for $1.00 via Cydia.
* Which solution do you prefer?
