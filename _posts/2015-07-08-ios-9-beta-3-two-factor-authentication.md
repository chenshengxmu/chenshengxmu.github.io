* At WWDC, Apple has made a promise to step up security with native two-factor authentication in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. Before today, the feature was unavailable on iOS 9 betas prior to beta 3.
* But with today’s release of iOS 9 beta 3, the new system has made its debut, with some users offered the option to upgrade their Apple ID to use the new two-factor authentication.
* Here’s what you need to know about this new system, how it increases your security and how it’s different from Apple’s existing two-step verification process.
* To begin with, Apple’s two-step verification has been available since March 2013.
* It’s since added a growing list of countries and an expanding list of services to protect, including Apple ID and iCloud accounts, FaceTime, iMessage and more.
* It introduces an additional layer of security by augmenting your Apple ID user name and password with a one-time code generated by your trusted device, basically an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad enrolled in two-step verification.
* After you enable two-step verification on your Apple ID, you’ll need to verify your identity using one of your devices before you can:
* The new two-step authentication system in iOS 9 and El Capitan builds on that foundation in order to tighten up your security even more, by engineering two-step authentication deep into the bowels of the new operating systems.
* For starters, verification codes have gone from four to six digits.
* Your six-digit verification code will be displayed automatically on your trusted iOS 9 or El Capitan devices whenever you sign in with your Apple ID on a new device or browser, letting you sign in securely.
* And compared to the existing two-step verification, the new two-step authentication uses different methods to trust devices and deliver verification codes while offering “a more streamlined” experience.
* A trusted device is an Apple device running iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan that you have already signed in to using two-factor authentication.
* “It is a device we know is yours and that can be used to verify your identity by displaying a verification code from Apple when signing in on another device or browser,” explains Apple.
* Like before, the codes are delivered as push notifications, or you can receive them on your phone via a text message or phone call instead. You will need to verify at least one phone number to enroll in the new two-factor authentication system.
* You can view and manage a list of your trusted devices in the Devices section of your Apple ID account at Settings > iCloud > Account on your iOS device, or System Preferences > iCloud > Account details on your Mac.
* Once a device/browser is verified and you opt to trust it going forward, you won’t have to enter a verification code the next time you sign in from that device unless:
* Removing a device from your list of trusted devices will ensure that it can no longer be used to receive verification codes.
* You can upgrade your Apple ID to use the new two-factor authentication if you run iOS 9 beta 3 or El Capitan beta 3.
* “During the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan public betas, enrollment in two-factor authentication will be limited,” says Apple. “Individual accounts will be made eligible gradually until we can offer the service to everyone.”
* If you’re on iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan beta installations earlier than beta 3, and you upgrade your Apple ID to the new two-step authentication, you may no be able to sign in to services that use Apple ID.
* Those already enrolled in the existing two-step verification system needn’t worry as all features will continue to work separately for you.
* The new two-step authentication is integrated tightly into iOS 9 and El Capitan, but using it on a device running an older version of iOS or OS X may prompt you to append a six-digit verification code to the end of your password instead of in a dedicated verification code field.
* Apple says devices running older OS versions will not receive verification codes, “except in the case of an iPhone that can receive verification codes via a text message or phone call to your trusted phone number.”
* If you already use Apple’s existing two-step verification service, you’re strongly discouraged from attempting to enroll in the new two-factor authentication system in iOS 9 and El Capitan until the operating systems release for public consumption this fall and the feature is offered to everyone.
* Come this fall, customers who set up iOS 9 or El Capitan on their devices will be offered to upgrade their Apple ID to two-factor authentication as part of the device setup process.
* Apple’s newly published FAQ, available on its portal for developers, details two-factor verification for the public betas of iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, which are launching later this month.
* In addition to the new two-step authentication, iOS 9 has security focused features like six-digit passcodes, a new default for passcodes on Touch ID–enabled iPhones and iPads.
* Compared to four-digit passcodes that have about 10,000 possible combinations, six-digit ones are a lot tougher to crack with more than a million possible combinations.
* Will you be checking out Apple’s new two-step authentication in iOS 9 and El Capitan or will you stick to the proven two-step verification method?
