title: iPad Jailbreak Video
---
* It didn’t take too long for  the jailbreak community to come up with a jailbreak for the iPad. Last week I told you about Spirit, a jailbreak for iPhone 3.1.3, and today, MuscleNerd confirmed the iPad jailbreak using a variation of Spirit, originally developed by Comex.
* Even better news is that this jailbreak can also be applied to every platform including the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 3G, and potentially to the iPad 3G.
* Credit goes where it’s due. This iPad jailbreak is a cross-team effort by @chronicdevteam, @comex, @chpwn, and the Dev Team.
* If you were on the fence about buying an iPad, this might just be the reason you were looking for.
* There is no estimated release date for this jailbreak. My guess is that these smart hackers will wait for iPhone OS 3.2, so Apple doesn’t patch the firmware and render this jailbreak useless.
* How exciting!
