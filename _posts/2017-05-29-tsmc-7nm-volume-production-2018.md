* Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which counts Apple as its biggest client, is ready to move its cutting-edge seven-nanometer process technology to volume production in 2018.
* According to DigiTimes, an improved version of TSMC’s seven-nanometer process using extreme ultraviolet technology will be ready for volume production in 2018, according to company co-CEO CC Wei.
* The firm’s five-nanometer node is slated to enter risk production in 2019, Wei added.
* TSMC currently makes A10 chips for iPhone 7 and is said to be exclusively churning out the upcoming Apple-designed A11 processors for iPhone 8 and other 2017 iOS devices.
* TSMC in April reportedly began stockpiling A11 chips for 2017 iPhones.
* The firm should step up its pace of inventory building from June onward, said industry sources.
* iPhone 8’s A11 system-on-a-chip should be built on TSMC’s ten-nanometer process technology, yielding faster performance and lower power consumption.
* The A11 Fusion chip inside iPhone 7 is being manufactured on TSMC’s 16-nanometer node.
* Apple is building a brand new chip dedicated to artificial intelligence and machine learning, Bloomberg said recently, but it’s unclear if the new chip will make its way into iPhone 8.
