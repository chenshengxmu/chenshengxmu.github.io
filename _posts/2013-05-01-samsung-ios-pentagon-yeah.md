* A new report is out this afternoon, claiming the US Department of Defense is going to grant security approvals for Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones, as well as Apple’s iPhones and iPads running iOS 6 in the coming weeks.
* The move is separate from the mobile device implementation plan that the Pentagon announced back in February, and could pave the way for Apple to gain more notable influence in the hard-to-reach government sector…
* The Wall Street Journal reports:
* “The Department of Defense is expected in coming weeks to grant two separate, security approvals for Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones, along with iPhones and iPads running Apple’s latest operating system, according to people familiar with the matter—moves that would boost the number of U.S. government agencies allowed to use those devices.”
* For Samsung, this means its hard work in Washington is paying off. The Journal says it’s hired several former RIM executives, as well as veterans from security-focused firms, and recently created an in-house enterprise team.
* For Apple, this would mean more, much-needed clout in mobile security, as an approval by the DoD is considered to be the gold standard in the field. It would certainly open doors with other like-minded, security-concerned clients.
* The only loser here appears to be BlackBerry. The company, which once dominated the government sector, has been having trouble getting security approval for its new BB10 OS, and has recently lost a number of high profile accounts.
