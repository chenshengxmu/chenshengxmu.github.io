* iMac Pro, the most powerful Mac system ever created, is officially going on sale this Thursday, December 14, Apple officially announced this morning via a website update.
* The iMac Pro webpage on Apple’s website was updated this morning to reflect the computer’s official release date. Yesterday’s report from AppleInsider noted that Apple’s sales channels are now preparing large customers for imminent iMac Pro orders.
* Announced and previewed at WWDC 2017 this summer, the all-in-one machine ships with a space gray-clad keyboard, trackpad and mouse in the box.
* The desktop computer features a massive 5K resolution display with wide color support and measuring 27 inches diagonally, up to 18-core server-grade Xeon processors from Intel, AMD’s Vega 56 or 64 graphics, up to 4TB of SSD storage, up to 128 GB of ECC DDR4 2666MHz RAM, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, four USB-A 3.0 ports, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port and more.
* Here’s MKBHD’s hands-on with iMac Pro.
* iMac Pro could also be the first Mac with support for the “Hey Siri” feature.
* iMac Pro is a short-term solution for professional customers who are unwilling to wait until Apple delivers its apparently highly modular Mac redesign at some point next year.
