* Springtomize 3 is arguably one of the most popular jailbreak tweaks in Cydia today, mostly because of its vast array of customization options for the multiple features throughout iOS.
* Despite an iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak having dropped without much warning, the developer maintaining Springtomize 3 has already launched an update with full support for the new jailbreak from Pangu.
* It’s no secret that Springtomize 3 packs a lot of features into one single jailbreak tweak for a fair price. In fact, with this amazing all-in-one monster tweak, you eliminate the need to install a lot of petty individual tweaks from Cydia.
* The tweak was originally created by well-known iOS developer Filippo Bigarella, but as he became busier with his life, the tweak’s development was passed on to iOS developer Janosch Hübner (AKA sharedRoutine) to maintain for future jailbreak releases.
* Springtomize 3 gives you options for modifying all the following parameters of your iOS device:
* The list of options from each pane are extensive, and the new tweak update is virtually no different than the version before it, so going too far into the specifics would be redundant. Instead, we’ll let you watch Jeff’s old review of Springtomize 3 below:
* Since the tweak’s core functionality really hasn’t changed, all or most of the same settings still apply. You can still use Springtomize 3 to customize your SpringBoard and other features of iOS with extreme precision and depth.
* Springtomize 3 is a $2.99 download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for everyone who doesn’t already own it, however Cydia is not yet allowing purchases from jailbreakers given the fact that the Pangu jailbreak is still so new. As a result, the only people who can download the updated version of Springtomize 3 right now are those who already own it, as it’s a free update for everyone that owned it previously.
* Saurik should be enabling purchases in Cydia after a week or two when the jailbreak and Cydia become more stable, so be sure to check back frequently to see if you can purchase it if you’re unable to do so right now.
* Keep in mind that Springtomize 3 also currently works with iOS 7 and iOS 8, in addition to iOS 9.
