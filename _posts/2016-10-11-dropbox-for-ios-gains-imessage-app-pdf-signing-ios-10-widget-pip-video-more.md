* Cloud storage startup Dropbox today announced a major update to its mobile application for the iPhone and iPad, bringing new iOS 10-focused features that will make you more productive. Dropbox 18.2 for iOS packs in a brand new iMessage app for sharing Dropbox files through Apple’s Messages app.
* You can now sign legal PDF documents with your finger, and see newly updated Dropbox files on your Lock screen via a new Today widget, and much more.
* Dropbox’s new iOS 10-style widget makes it possible to create and view files without unlocking your iPhone or iPad (iOS 10 required). After adding it to your Lock screen, just swipe right to get to the Dropbox widget which you can use to create, view and upload files. You can even scan documents into Dropbox right from the Lock screen.

* A brand iMessage app from Dropbox integrates with Apple’s stock Messages app and allows you to share recent files via the iMessage service. Just select Dropbox files you’d like to send through iMessage and share them in-line with the conversation.
* On compatible iPads, Dropbox now supports the Picture in Picture feature (iOS 9+ required) so you can watch a video from your Dropbox while working in another app.

* Support for Split Screen multitasking mode will be added in the coming weeks.
* When you receive legal documents in the PDF file format that need signing, you can now do just that, with your finger, right within the mobile Dropbox app on your iOS device.
* Here’s the new iOS signature tool in action.

* Lastly, Dropbox now notifies you as soon as someone saves a new version of a file you’re viewing: a single tap reloads the file on your end so you can see what’s changed.
* Grab Dropbox for iPhone and iPad free from the App Store.
