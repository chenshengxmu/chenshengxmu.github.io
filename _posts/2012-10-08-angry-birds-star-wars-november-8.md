* Forgive Rovio for milking the Angry Birds franchise for all its worth, but if it hadn’t been for the original Angry Birds game no one would have heard of a small Finnish game developer that was struggling to make a living making games you never heard about. Hot on the heels of releasing Bad Piggies and Angry Birds Space, Rovio has just announced a broad partnership with Hasbro, a toy and board game company.
* The mash-up will see Rovio release a range of Star Wars and Angry Birds figurines, costumes, plush toys and a brand new Angry Birds game set in the Star Wars universe. More information and a teaser trailer follow right after the break…
* In addition to the Angry Birds Star Wars game which will be released on iOS, Android and PC, according to The Verge the collaboration with Hasbro will result in a bunch of merchandise, plus toys, costumes and more, here are the highlights:
* • Star Wars Angry Birds Jenga Deah Star game • Star Wars Angry Birds At-At Attack Battle game • Star Wars Early Angry Birds figurine pack • Star Wars Angry Birds plush toy line (basically, Angry Birds dressed up as Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker and R2-D2) • Star Wars Angry Birds costumes (foam tunics shaped like Angry Birds in Star Wars gear)
* Here’s a packshot for the Star Wars Angry Birds At-At Attack Battle game.

* And this is your teaser trailer.
* Idle Hands has more pictures of these merchandise, if you’re interested.
* Rovio has also set up the official Angry Birds Star Wars page with more Angry Birds meets Star Wars goodness, including behind-the-scenes content, animations, comics and more.

* More will be known at New York Comic Con 2012.
* So, what’s your call: is this a little bit too much of Angry Birds for you or the expected progression of the series?
