* In certain scenarios, your Apple ID may become disabled and you could end up locked out of it. These situations are frustrating, but there are different reasons why an Apple ID may become disabled.

* If your Apple ID is ever disabled or locked, Apple has an account recovery system in place, called iForgot, which you can use to regain access to your account. In many cases, but not all of them, you will be asked to reset your Apple ID password to gain access to your account once again.
* Alternatively, you can also use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID on another trusted device or phone of yours; just keep in mind that if you’re using two-step verification, a recovery key will be required as well as a trusted device.
* If you are unsuccessful in recovering your Apple ID too many times in one day, you may need to wait a full day before you can proceed with more attempts to unlock your account. This is another security feature that prevents brute force attacks from hackers from being effective.

* A locked or disabled Apple ID is never fun, so there are some things you can do to protect yourself and keep your account from getting locked again in the future:
* Having a locked or disabled Apple ID is not the best feeling in the world, but there are ways around it; you just need to remain patient. It’s a good idea to get familiar with the ways to recover your account, as well as with ways to prevent the problem from happening again.
