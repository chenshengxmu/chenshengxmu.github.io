* Appendix is a new jailbreak tweak that breathes new life into Home screen folders on iOS. It allows you to launch apps directly from folders using the iPhone 6s’ 3D Touch gesture.
* Instead of having to open a folder to select an app that you wish to launch, users with Appendix installed, a free jailbreak tweak now available on Cydia, can open apps with a single gesture. It’s not the perfect solution for directly launching apps found in folders, but it’s pretty interesting nonetheless.
* Once you have Appendix installed, it begins working immediately. There are no options or settings that need to be configured before you can use the tweak. Simply 3D Touch on a folder of your choice, and you’ll see the shortcut menu appear with up to four apps.
* Unfortunately, Appendix is only able to display the first four applications found in a folder. That means that if you wish to launch a specific app found in a folder, you’ll need to make sure that the app is one of the first four apps listed. That is the downside that I alluded to at the outset.
* Still, Appendix is a good tweak that does something that no other jailbreak tweak has done thus far. For that reason, even with its four app limitation, I recommend taking it for a spin. And if you don’t own a 3D Touch capable device, you can use a jailbreak tweak like revealMenu to simulate the 3D Touch effect on older devices.
* You can find Appendix available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. What do you think?
