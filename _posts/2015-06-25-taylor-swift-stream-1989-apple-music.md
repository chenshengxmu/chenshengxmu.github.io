* Well, good PR doesn’t get any better than this. Following a week of back and forth between Apple and Taylor Swift over royalty payments during Apple Music’s free trial, the popular pop musician and actress said her top-selling album “1989” will stream on Apple’s service, which launches next Tuesday.
* “After the events of this week, I’ve decided to put ‘1989’ on Apple Music,” she wrote on Twitter.
* The newsworthy development bears special significance as “1989” won’t be available on any streaming service, at least for the time being, with the sole exception of Apple Music.
* Given Swift’s klout—the four singles released from “1989” have all reached number one in the United States—she is definitely in a position to scold Apple publicly without being reprimanded.
* After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music…and happily so.

* After Apple changed its mind and agreed to pay 0.2 cents for each song streamed during a customer’s trial, Swift welcomed the move writing on Twitter she was “elated and relieved,” but stopped short of saying whether she’d allow “1989” to be streamed on Apple Music.
* “In case you were wondering wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you’ve seen Apple do with other artists, it’s not,” she wrote in a tweet Thursday.
* “This is simply the first time it’s felt right in my gut to stream my album,” she wrote in another tweet, adding, “Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart.”
* Taylor Swift famously pulled her music from Spotify and other streaming services over paltry royalties for free trials.

* The Reading, Pennsylvania born musician is signed with the independent label Big Machine Records. Curiously enough, a sketch February 2015 report claimed Apple wanted to buy Big Machine Records along with Swift’s back catalog for about $250 million, but an iTunes spokesperson officially denied the report.
* Her fifth studio album, “1989” was described by Swift herself as her “first documented official pop album” marking a notable stylistic departure from the country music of her previous albums.
* For those wondering, the album title was inspired by the pop-music scene of the 1980s and particularly Swift’s birth year. Swift, 25, collaborated on “1989” with producers Max Martin and Shellback.
* The album debuted at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and sold 1.287 million copies during the first week of release, making Swift the first artist to sell more than a million copies of an album in a week-long period for three albums.
* “1989” was a huge commercial success for Swift and is the best-selling album in the United States after selling more than five million copies since its November 2014 release.
* Apple Music launches on Tuesday, June 30, on the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac and Windows PC devices, with an Android app and Apple TV compatibility coming this fall.
* For a flat monthly fee of $9.99 per month, or $14.99 for a family of six, music lovers gain unlimited streaming with offline playback, a ‘Beats 1’ 24/7 Internet radio hosted by celebrity DJs, human curation of playlists, a Connect feature for artists and more.
