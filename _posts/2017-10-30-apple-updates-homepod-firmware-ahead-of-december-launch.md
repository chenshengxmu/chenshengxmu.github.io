* With first betas of iOS 11.2, tvOS 11.2 and watchOS 4.2 now available to Apple’s registered developers, the company on Monday updated the HomePod firmware ahead of the scheduled December launch of its Siri-powered wireless speaker accessory.
* MacRumors notes that the firmware isn’t available through Apple’s portal for developers, but it will be downloadable by testers who have a HomePod. The refreshed software is also listed on third-party iOS software sites, making it available for download by the public.
* Apple employees have been testing HomePod for some time now.
* The previous HomePod firmware famously included an iPhone X glyph that revealed the controversial notch and overall handset design. That being said, it will be interesting seeing if the new firmware perhaps came with other hidden Apple secrets.
* Priced at $349, HomePod is launching this December.
