* For months, lawyers for California-based Apple and bankrupt monitor vendor Proview have been trying to negotiate a way out of a high-stake trademark dispute which has been holding back the launch of the new iPad in the 1.33 billion people China market.
* According to the latest update out from China’s official government newswire Xinhua, Apple has now put a dollar value on their settlement offer to Proview, finally moving the ball forward…
* According to the state-owned Xinhua news service, “pragmatic progress” has been made in the dispute between the Shenzen-based maker of computer screens and LED lights and Apple over use of the iPad trademark.
* Specifically, the two parties discussed a compensation package, with Apple tabling an undisclosed amount to which Proview has not agreed on yet.
* A lawyer for Proview told the news gathering organization on Sunday:
* We feel that the attitude of Apple Inc. has changed. Although they expressed that they were willing to negotiate, they have never taken any action before. But now, they are having conversations with us, and we have begun to consult on the case.
* A cash payout from Apple would enable Proview to pay its debt back to creditors. Though Apple already launched the third-generation iPad in 57 countries, it’s not yet available in China over pending trademark suit.
* Despite the legal mess, Apple can continue to sell iPads in Shanghai.
* Another lawyer who knows a thing or two about intellectual property rights cases told the media organization that the possibility of Proview prevailing in court remains “very high”, but warned “it may take years to get the compensation”.
* Proview’s stance jives with their proclaimed willingness to settle the dispute as both parties recently entered a voluntary mediation procedure that should lead to negotiations over a possible settlement.
* Though Tim Cook met with Chinese politicos to talk patents, a few weeks later the government unexpectedly sided with Proview, insisting the company owns rights to the iPad trademark in China.
* Should Apple lose its court fight with Proview, it could face a big fine plus a country-wide ban on iPad sales in China.
* I’m glad to see Apple come to their senses. Here’s to hoping Apple will rethink their numerous legal battles fought in courtrooms the world over. Under the guidance of CEO Tim Cook, Apple has shown some willingness to negotiate.
* Cook recently said he wasn’t fond of a “thermonuclear” option regarding Android patent infringement cases that had been pursued by late co-founder Steve Jobs. Instead, the new CEO would rather explore licensing options.
* The company would reportedly settle for a royalty for of up to fifteen bucks per Android device sold.
* I think it would be in Apple interest to negotiate settlements because this whole litigation thing has already gotten out of hand.
* Are you glad that the Proview case seems to be moving toward a settlement?
