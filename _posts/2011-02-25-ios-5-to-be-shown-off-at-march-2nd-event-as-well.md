* With Apple’s iPad 2 event officially kicking off next week, the folks over at Engadget have been tipped additional details regarding the event.
* According to Engadget, not only will Apple announce the iPad 2, it will also preview iOS 5 at the media event, which will be held Wednesday, March 2nd, at the famous Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco…
* It’s also almost guaranteed that we’ll see the next version of iOS (number 5 in all likelihood, along with its SDK for devs), and an expansion of Apple’s cloud services (that part is a little… foggy right now). Of course, that will perfectly set up Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 5 in June, which is when iPad owners can likely expect to be using the new software. Regardless, we’ll have the goods come next week, so stay tuned!
* Although there has not been any word on what features iOS 5 packs, it is very likely that it will bring a newer, revamped notification system.
* As far as the iPad 2 goes, Engadget claims that the second-generation iPad will receive a spec bump, with the inclusion of a more powerful Apple A5 processor and 512MB of RAM, along with a thinner design and a front facing camera. According to Engadget, the resolution and screen size on the iPad 2 will remain the same as the original iPad.
* We’re hearing it’s most likely a thinner, spec-bumped variation of the original iPad with a screen size and resolution identical to the current model. More RAM (512MB) and a more powerful CPU (the A5) are expected as well. It’s also a pretty safe bet the tablet will be sporting at least one camera up front — though if some of those case mockups we’ve seen tell us anything, expect a shooter around back too.
* Since little is known about iOS 5, what are some must-have features you would like? Let us know in the comments!
