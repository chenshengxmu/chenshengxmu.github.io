title: The Apple Watch is water resistant, but that shouldn't come as a surprise

* You know, I was considering doing a “shower test” when I received my Apple Watch today, but I’m pretty confident that that’s no longer necessary. The Apple Watch appears to be water resistant enough to easily manage a shower or a splash. In fact, in this video, an early Apple Watch Sport adopter submerges the device in water for five minutes at a time. He even takes the Apple Watch for a swim in a pool. Watch this video and see the evidence for yourself.
* Initially, we didn’t even think it would be possible to take a shower while wearing with the Apple Watch. Then, Tim Cook was quoted, perhaps a bit out of context, as saying that he wears his watch while showering. And finally, at its last media event for the highly-anticipated wearable, Apple officially stated that the watch is splash proof and water resistant, but not waterproof.
* The Apple Watch features an IPX7 water rating, which actually means that the footage above shouldn’t really come as a big surprise. Here’s what a IPX7 water rating entails.
* In the video above, it doesn’t look like the guy was deeper than 1 meter (3 ft), and he states that he did the tests for 5 minutes at a time. So he appears to be within the IPX7 specs, and hence we shouldn’t be surprised that it held up as well as it did.
* I’m never going to take my Apple Watch swimming, but I will be using it regularly in the shower to listen to podcasts, and that’s going to be epic. What about you? Do you plan on getting your Apple Watch wet?
