* It’s been two weeks since Apple released the first beta of iOS 7 to its registered developers. A lot has been written about it and way more ink will be spent as subsequent betas get released and thoroughly tested before iOS 7 is eventually ready for prime time this Fall. If history is anything to go by and if you trust reliable sources in the know, today is the day iOS 7 Beta 2 arrives.
* If iDB is part of your daily routine, you should be among the first to know when a new beta hits Apple’s servers. Also, count on our resident team to take a closer look at the new beta and report back about everything there is to know about  feature changes.
* Stay tuned…
* BGR isn’t totally accurate, but when it comes to wireless carriers they have some top notch sources there who told the publication that iOS 7 Beta 2 is landing today:
* We have been told via our carrier sources that iOS 7, Apple’s brand new mobile operating system to be released sometime this fall, will be getting an update to beta 2 today.
* Apple usually releases iOS betas to carriers first, before posting the files to its portal for developers. That said, we’re expecting to see the new build on Apple’s Developer portal around 10pm Pacific.
* Soon after, BGR amended the story by saying that “Our carrier sources have confirmed that iOS 7 beta 2 has now been released to carriers, as we reported”.

* Developer Will Hains put together a nice chart seen below, based on public data, which illustrates development cycles for each iOS version. As you can see, Apple keeps the first beta out there for two weeks before replacing it with a second beta.
* This means the firm is likely to seed iOS 7 Beta 2 to its registered developers today, June 24.
* As for iOS 7 Beta 3, you’re looking at a July 10 date – again, taking into account Apple’s past iOS development cycles.
* Cult of Mac calculated the average time it took for an iOS x.0 beta release to move on to the next beta.
* Beta 1 – lasts 14.75 days Beta 2 – lasts 15.4 days Beta 3 – lasts 15 days Beta 4 – lasts 18.6 days Beta 5 – lasts 17.8 days Beta 6 – lasts 11 days
* Based on this, the publication came up with the following iOS 7 release dates:
* Beta 2 – Monday, June 24 Beta 3 – Wednesday, July 10 Beta 4 – Thursday, July 25 Beta 5 – Monday, August 12 Beta 6 – Friday, August 30 Gold Master – Tuesday, September 10 iOS 7 Final – Friday, September 20
* Because so-called Gold Master releases are treated as betas, a GM after Beta 4 will be shown as Beta 5.
* A bunch of non-registered developers, fans and enthusiasts were able to get their hands on a beta of iOS 7 – certainly many more compared to past iOS releases.
* Because those enthusiasts blog about beta issues without necessarily understanding the nature of beta software, we felt compelled to do a post about the supposedly “missing” iOS 7 features and another one detailing what to expect from iOS 7 Betas.
* And if you want to learn how each iOS release has transformed from Beta 1 to release, check out a nice post by Michael Steeber over at 9to5Mac.
* Are you looking forward to Beta 2?
