* You just spent $500+ on a new iPad, don’t you think it’d be smart to spend a few more bucks on a nice screen and casing protection? That’s what the ZAGG Invisible Shield has to offer. I’m a big believer in ZAGG products especially the Invisible Shield, which offers great protection for the front and the back of your iPad.
* The price isn’t bad either. $40 for both the front and the back, or $30 for either the front or the back. I’m currently using Apple’s Smart Cover which does a great job at protecting the screen but leaves the back of the iPad vulnerable to virtually anything (especially that coffee table I usually put my iPad on), so I know I’m going to go with the InvisibleShield for the back only.
* If you think you might benefit from this, make sure to buy your InvisibleShield from here and enter coupon code zagg20 to get 20% off your order.
