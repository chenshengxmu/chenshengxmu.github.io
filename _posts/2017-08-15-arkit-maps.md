* As a big sucker for augmented reality demos built with Apple’s ARKit framework, I tirelessly search for them virtually (pun intended) every day on YouTube.
* Having seen my fair share of ARKit-driven work-in-progress apps, I have no doubt in my mind that ARKit-powered navigation is one of the killer apps that will sell the mainstream consumer on the benefits of augmented reality experiences.
* The best example of navigation in augmented reality that I’ve come across so far is iOS developer Andrew Hart‘s work with ARKit and CoreLocation.
* The end result is enhanced real-world navigation where turn-by-turn directions and points of interest are added to the live view from a device’s camera in a way that makes those elements appear to inhabit the real world.
* Check this out.
* And in the following example, he’s using ARKit and CoreLocation to render the names of various buildings and landmarks. I’ve seen a few App Store apps that do that, but they’re nowhere near touching Apple’s framework when it comes to tracking accuracy and speed.

* This is obviously just the beginning. When iOS 11 launches this fall, many developers will jump on the ARKit bandwagon to build ARKit-enhanced navigation and mapping products.

* Apple’s own Maps app on iOS 11 includes a new virtual reality mode that uses ARKit for positioning: use search in Maps to find a major city or landmark, then tap the Flyover button and the map will adjust its view as you’re walking around the room.
* For example, use this feature to move the view of the Sydney Opera House or the Eiffel Tower around by tilting your iPhone or iPad or, better yet, going for a short walk. As you’re walking around, the vide of the 3D city model adjusts accordingly.
* Are you amazed by the potential ARKit holds for turn-by-turn navigation and maps?
