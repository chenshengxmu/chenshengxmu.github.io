* Twitter’s Vine app, which happens to be one of our favorite social networking apps, was updated this weekend with a handful of improvements. The new version, which is marked as 1.4.5, includes bug fixes, support for new languages and a new feature.
* And that feature is a big one. After updating, Vine iPhone users will have the ability to hide revines when browsing a user’s profile feed. So that means you will no longer have to scroll through countless revined videos to get to a user’s self-made content…
* Here’s the change log:
* – Ability to hide revines when browsing a user’s profile feed – Bug fixes and stability improvements – Support for Polish
* I’ll be honest, as a Vine user myself, I have been waiting for months for them to implement this hide-revines feature. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come across a user, and had to browse through 20-30 revines before getting to one of their own clips.
* For those unfamiliar with the app, Vine is a video-sharing platform that allows you to edit and post 6-second video clips. It launched in January of this year, and despite competition from Facebook’s Instagram, remains in the top 25 list of free App Store apps.
* You can find the latest version of the Vine iPhone app in the App Store for free.
