* Apple has seeded the fourth beta of OS X 10.9.4 to registered Mac developers for testing. This latest OS X Mavericks beta has the build number 13E25 and arrives just six days following the third OS X 10.9.4 beta release. As with most of these minor build releases, it is unknown exactly what changes that Apple has made, but we should be nearing a public release soon… 
* The pre-release software is available through Software Update if your Mac is already running OS X 10.9.4, although it has not yet been seeded through the public-facing OS X Mavericks Beta Seed Program. The software update is also available as a direct download through the Mac Developer Center alongside a copy of the official release notes.

* As with most OS X beta versions, Apple has outlined the specific focus areas for developers in OS X 10.9.4 as the App Store, Safari, Finder Bluetooth, graphics and audio drivers. Apple has simultaneously released this OS X 10.9.4 beta alongside the OS X Yosemite Developer Preview. It would be expected that OS X 10.9.4 is publicly released before OS X Yosemite in the fall.
* Are you enrolled in the OS X Beta Seed Program?
