* At the Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this week, Apple unveiled a fourth major iteration to the watchOS operating system powering Apple Watch. The software offers many improvements, like more intelligence and fitness features, as well as a bunch of smaller fixes.
* One of the new features in watchOS 4 will permit Apple Watch owners who dislike the honeycomb app grid to switch to a brand new list view of their apps.
* To change the way you view and select apps on your Apple Watch, press the Digital Crown to go to the Home screen, then press the screen firmly with Force Touch and choose List View.

* The apps are now presented in a scrollable list view, sorted alphabetically. Just turn the Digital Crown to scroll through the list of apps, then tap one to launch it. To return to the standard honeycomb app layout, choose the Grid View option from the menu.

* The only downside to using list over grid view is the inability to rearrange apps in list view.
* You cannot change this setting from within the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone. This feature will be available to all Apple Watch owners as soon as watchOS 4 releases for public consumption this fall.
* Keep in mind that the watchOS 4 software update will leave iPhone 5/5c users in the dark because it requires at least a paired iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11 to download and install. As you know, iOS 11 has removed support for 32-bit devices like iPhone 4s and iPhone 5/5c.
* How do you like this handy new feature in watchOS 4?
