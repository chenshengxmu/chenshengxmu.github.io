* Folks, we’re back with Episode 04 of Ask Jeff. I wanted to thank everyone for all of the great questions; we had over 200 combined questions for Episode 03.
* Unfortunately, that means that I didn’t get to answer everyone’s question, but I still managed to cover quite a few interesting inquiries this go ’round.
* Inside, you’ll find out how much money I’ve spent on Cydia tweaks over the years, whether I’d consider switching to Verizon, and what my first Apple product was.
* In other words, tune in and prepare your questions; you won’t want to miss this…
* Was your question on this week’s docket? If not, don’t give up, keep asking.
* Do you have any suggestions, comments or questions? If so, be sure to drop me a line in the comments section below. Don’t be scurred!
