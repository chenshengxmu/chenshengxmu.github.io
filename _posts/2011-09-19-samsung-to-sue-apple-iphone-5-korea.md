* Welcome to chapter XXVII of the ridiculous legal battle that Samsung and Apple are fighting, mostly over patents dictating who owns what technology. Today’s potential lawsuit is brought to you by Samsung.
* Even though the iPhone 5 currently is no more than a bunch of rumors and speculations, Samsung already knows for sure that it will bring Apple to court over the iPhone 5 as soon as it hits Korea…
* “Just after the arrival of the iPhone 5 here, Samsung plans to take Apple to court here for its violation of Samsung’s wireless technology related patents,’’ said a senior executive from Samsung Electronics, asking not to be identified.
* For as long as Apple does not drop mobile telecommunications functions, it would be impossible for it to sell its i-branded products without using our patents. We will stick to a strong stance against Apple during the lingering legal fights.”
* There are currently over 23 lawsuits pending all around the world between Apple and Samsung, so this is just the beginning of the pissing contest. May the best lawyers win!
* In the meantime, you can read some of our previous coverage of Samsung vs. Apple here.
