* iOS 12, internally code-named “Peace”, will reportedly bring several Siri improvements to the mix, among them deeper integration between the smart assistant and the system-wide search feature on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* Mark Gurman, reporting Monday for Bloomberg, claims that the Cupertino technology giant is working hard to “more deeply integrate Siri into the iPhone’s search view” on iOS 12. The author did not elaborate further, but the wording suggests he is referring to the system-wide Search feature, formerly known as Spotlight.
* iOS 11 brought several new Search and Siri improvements, including giving users the ability to control which apps are allowed to be indexed by Siri in order to make relevant suggestions when using the Search and Look Up features or typing using the QuickType keyboard.
* Other enhancements in iOS 12 reportedly include an enhanced Do Not Disturb mode with additional options to automatically reject phone calls or silence notifications, as well as Animoji improvements such as FaceTime and iPad support, new characters and more.
* Bloomberg has shared other interesting details pertaining to Apple’s renewed focus on software quality. As previously reported, engineering teams should have more time to work on new features and focus on under-the-hood refinements in an effort to curb bugs and flaws.
* What other Siri improvements would you like to see in iOS 12, and why?
