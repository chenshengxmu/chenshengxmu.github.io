* Apple has hired Esin Terzioglu, Qualcomm’s Vice President of Engineering, to act as the project lead on its wireless system-on-a-chip project, suggesting the Cupertino company could be developing its own baseband modem for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices, reports AppleInsider.
* Unlike Apple’s in-house designed chips, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors  and Samsung’s own Exynos chips integrate the CPU, GPU and the LTE modem on the same chip package.
* iPhone 7, for instance, uses dedicated LTE modems from both Intel and Qualcomm.
* “After an amazing eight years at Qualcomm, it is time for me to move on to my next adventure,” Terzioglu shared the news via his LinkedIn account.
* “I feel privileged for the opportunity to continue my career at Apple,” he added.
* He is credit as an inventor of many Qualcomm patents.
* After joining Qualcomm in August 2009, Terzioglu lead the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Central Engineering organization. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a Ph.D. minor in Computer Science, both completed at Stanford University.
* Apple and Qualcomm are currently embroiled in a $1 billion licensing dispute related to the royalty fees the iPhone maker and other companies pay to Qualcomm for its cellular chips.
* According to Axios, the chip maker has asked a US court to force iPhone suppliers to keep paying it royalty fees, while it continues its legal battle with the Cupertino giant.
