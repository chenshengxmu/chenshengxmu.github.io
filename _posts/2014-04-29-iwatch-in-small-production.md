* According to a new report from the China Times, Apple’s manufacturing partners have begun producing the iWatch. Citing  supply chain sources, the outlet says that the company’s highly anticipated smartwatch has entered production in small quantities ahead of an expected fall launch.
* The report echoes previous chatter, which has mostly pointed to a fall iWatch release up to this point. It also lines up with predictions from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo earlier this month, claiming that the wearable will be built using system-in-package modules, instead of PCBs…
* Here’s more from the China Times:
* According to supply chain sources cited by the Chinese media, Apple has already started producing the iWatch in small quantities. The smartwatch will allegedly be ready for launch in the second half of 2014, but more importantly, these fresh reports also claim that the iWatch will be built using SiPs (or system-in-package modules) as opposed to traditional PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)
* An SiP setup could allow Apple to fit more hardware into the tiny packaging, such as various motion and health-tracking sensors. It’s believed the so-called iWatch will work with iOS 8 and its new Healthbook app to deliver various health-related data points including heart rate and steps taken.

* Apple has, over the past year, hired a number of doctors, scientists and other experts in health-related fields for a secret project—said to be the iWatch. And more recently, Nike announced that it was shuttering its FuelBand hardware efforts, spurring talk that the two companies are collaborating.
* Rumors regarding the device have ranged from a high-end, fashionable wristwatch design, to a high-tech fitness band with gesture controls. About the only detail we’ve seen stay consistent is the fall launch date. After years of speculation, Apple is expected to introduce the iWatch in September.
