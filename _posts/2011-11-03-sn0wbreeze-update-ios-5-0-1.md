* Today iH8Sn0w updated his popular jailbreak tool Sn0wBreeze with support for the iOS 5.0.1 developer beta. This update also fixes the iBooks sandbox and Location Services issue with the iPhone 3GS.
* As usual, this update blocks a UDID check and beta timer. This means that you do not need to be a registered developer to use this beta and that you can use the beta for as long as you wish… 
* If you don’t know already, Sn0wBreeze is a popular jailbreaking tool for Windows, and it is a good alternative to RedSn0w. If you don’t know how to use Sn0wbreeze, we have our own guide.
* This jailbreak is tethered, meaning that you will have to re-jailbreak your device each time you restart. A new package called Semitethered was released recently which allows you to restart your iDevice without the use of a computer. However, there are some features that are disabled intermittently because of the tethered aspect.
* Here is the change log for Sn0wbreeze v2.8b9:
* This jailbreak is untethered on the iPhone 3GS (old bootrom) and tethered on all other iDevices. A jailbreak for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 has not been released yet.
* If you’re interested in downloading SnowBreeze, you can do so from our Downloads page.
