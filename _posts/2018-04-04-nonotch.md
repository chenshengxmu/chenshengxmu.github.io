* While many iPhone X users have embraced the handset’s distinct notch, there are still tons of people who just can’t seem to get over it.
* If you’re one of the latter and your iPhone X is jailbroken, then a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed noNotch by iOS developer Jake James might be worth checking out.
* Just as the name implies, noNotch makes the iPhone X’s notch much less discernable. It does this by filling the top of the handset’s OLED display with a solid black bar, as shown above.
* Before a jailbreak existed for the iPhone X, you could accomplish a similar effect on the Home screen and Lock screen with the help of a unique wallpaper app, but this method wouldn’t impact apps and other interfaces.
* noNotch rounds the top corners of every interface you use, whether it’s an app or the Home screen itself. This small detail makes the effect system-wide and plays an instrumental role in tricking your eyes into thinking the notch is gone.
* The notch never actually disappears because it’s a part of the iPhone X’s display hardware, but the OLED display produces truer blacks than a typical LCD display would. It’s incredibly difficult to distinguish the notch under most circumstances, and the result is satisfying.
* noNotch doesn’t have any options to configure as of this writing, but a future update will permit users to toggle the tweak on a per-app basis rather than all or nothing.
* If you’d like to try noNotch out for yourself, then you can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is intended only for jailbroken iPhone X handsets, and the developer open-sourced the source code on GitHub for anyone interested.
* Note: The developer is aware of a bug in landscape orientation in the initial release and is working to fix it in a future update. Your patience is appreciated.
