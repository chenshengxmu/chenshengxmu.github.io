title: LimeRa1n Jailbreak for all iDevices is for Real

* Yesterday we broke the news about the potential come back of Geohot and LimeRa1n, a new jailbreak-it-all tool that will supposedly be released next Monday, a day after GreenPois0n scheduled release date. At first I was very skeptical about it and to be honest with you, I still am.
* However it’s been confirmed by all the big wigs that LimeRa1n is indeed for real and that it will most likely drop on Monday. Here is what we know so far…
* StealthBravo explained why LimeRa1n will be released on Monday:
* The significance of 10/11/10 is that its the one year anniversary of blackra1n’s release. 10/11/10 is the targeted release of limera1n
* P0sixninja confirmed that Geohot is coming back with a different bootrom exploit that he wants Chronic Dev to use in GreenPois0n. No matter what happens, we’ll have a jailbreak. P0sixninja also confirmed Geohot is a little brat:
* yes, the news about geohot is true, the day after we release ETA he decides he wants a piece of the #pie
* and yes it is a different bootrom exploit, he wants us to use it in GP, but there’s no way we’ll make our ETA if we do
* We are not changing our release date. If we can implement @geohots before 10/10 we will use that, otherwise we’re using ours. #roadblocks
* i’m not mad at geohot, I just think it’s awful timing, and no his exploit is not better then ours, that’s why he wants to save ours
* heh, geohot confirmed he only decided to work on limera1n when he found out we released an ETA #asshole
* MuscleNerd made it clear that Geohot’s move is a waste of exploits and that he’s making Apple’s job easier in patching holes and making it harder for us to jailbreak.
* As dramatic as geohot’s last-minute all-device JB is, still a shame that two bootrom holes will be burned at once.
* The Chronic Dev Team also cleared the air and confirmed that no matter what, we’ll have a jailbreak on Sunday.
* Note: greenpois0n will be released as planned. if someone decides to burn a different perfectly good exploit, that is entirely on them.
* We are currently working the “situation” out. Don’t worry, you’ll still get the jailbreak in the end, nothing to be concerned about.
* Comex didn’t really hide his feelings about what Geohot’s doing and clarified things up about LimeRa1n and GreenPois0n.
* geohot always shows up at the exact right time to cause drama…
* Reminder: the limerain thing is also tethered, so the pwned for life bit is only for a tethered jailbreak.
* both limerain and greenpoison are using the same userland exploit to untether on 4.1 only.
* Chpwn was also pretty clear that Geohot is wasting an exploit.
* If we end up somehow disclosing two bootrom exploits this week, ruining chances for a next-gen bootrom exploit, I will be very, very pissed.
* So what’s going on? Basically all the jailbreak community is against Geohot. They don’t want him to waste a precious exploit so they’re trying to use his exploit to implement it in GreenPois0n and keep the current SHAtter exploit for later.
* You might think that in the end iPhone users will win because no matter what happens we’ll still get a jailbreak and maybe even a jailbreak for the iPhone 3GS. True and wrong. It’s true because we’ll indeed get jailbreaks for all devices. It’s wrong because once we’ve used these exploits, we might not be able to jailbreak iOS 4.2 when it comes out next month.
* So what’s your take on this?
