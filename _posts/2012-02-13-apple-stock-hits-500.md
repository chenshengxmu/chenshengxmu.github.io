title: Apple stock hits the $500 mark for the first time ever
---
* A few days ago, we were praising Apple’s stock new records, which valued he company at more than Google and Microsoft combined. At the time, the stock was trading at about $495, which its highest price ever.

* Today, and after a few days of playing around the $500 mark, the stock finally broke it, trading as high as $503.83 for a few instants…
* What’s with the craziness, you might ask?
* First, Apple has presented some records financial results for last quarter, which fueled the stock price more than usual. But maybe more importantly, there is a rumor going around that Apple might start paying dividends to its investors, something the company has never done before. I guess we’ll find out in a couple weeks, when Apple holds its investors meeting.
* Is Apple still a good buy? I’m not Wall Street expert but I know enough about Apple and the industry to assure you that Apple still has beautiful days ahead. Buy, buy, buy!
