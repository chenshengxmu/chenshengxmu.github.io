* One of the headlining new additions in iOS 6 (headlining, as in featured in its own TV ad) is the Panorama camera mode. Once activated, the feature allows you to easily take extra-wide panoramic photos.
* By default, Panorama mode has you pan your iPhone from left to right as it captures the image. But did you know there’s an easy way to change it so you can pan from right to left?
* This isn’t a new tip by any means. But after coming across the pointer this morning, we figured it was worth mentioning to our readers in case anyone hadn’t heard it before. So let’s get started.
* And that’s all there is to it! Super simple, I know. But again, for anyone who wasn’t aware that you could change the panning direction in Panorama mode, this could come in handy in several situations.
