* Apple has added to its struggling Maps service cool three-dimensional Flyover views for three major new cities in Australia and Europe.
* Starting today, anyone can rotate and zoom in on the architectural details and explore the topography of Australia’s Perth, Spain’s Cordoba and France’s Saint Tropez.
* The company’s been dutifully expanding 3D Flyover coverage in more place around the world. Back in January, folks living in the cities of Marseille, France; Cape Town, South Africa; and Helsinki, Finland started seeing 3D Flyover maps in Apple Maps on iOS and OS X…
* New Flyover cities were first reported by MacPrime.ch.

* A list of Flyover-enabled locations is available on Apple’s website.
* As of this writing, Flyover maps were live in 53 cities around the world.
* First released alongside iOS 6 two years ago as part of the ill-fated Apple Maps offering, Flyover maps are painstakingly created from data gathered from Apple’s fleet of planes which capture high-resolution terrain imagery at multiple angles.
* Apple Maps should be enhanced with several new features in iOS 8, including public transit information, more accurate terrain data, a new vehicle-finding feature and more.
* According to Apple’s job post, a secret Maps project is in the works, with a patent indicating a bunch of new mapping layers. Another job post hinted at transit data being implemented.
* The iPhone maker’s recent $350 million acquisition of motion gesture firm PrimeSense prompted speculation that PrimeSense’s motion-sensing gestural technology could be used strategically to improve Maps accuracy.
* How’s Apple Maps been for you in terms of accuracy and reliability?
* Has Apple enabled 3D Flyovers in your area?
