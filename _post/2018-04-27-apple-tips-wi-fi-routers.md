* Apple yesterday published a support document with tips for choosing Wi-Fi routers.
* This handy resource follows yesterday’s confirmation from an Apple spokesperson that the company was officially discontinuing its AirPort wireless base station lineup.
* The support document is available on Apple’s website and offers advice on choosing a Wi-Fi router to use with your Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, HomePod or other Apple devices.
* It lists the following essential features in terms of compatibility, reliability and performance that customers should be looking for when shopping for a third-party Wi-Fi router.
* “A traditional, single router is suitable for the size and layout of most home environments,” notes the Cupertino technology firm. For larger areas, mesh Wi-Fi systems offer flexible coverage with multiple nodes that make it easy to provide whole-home Wi-Fi.
* Unlike a traditional Wi-Fi extender, a mesh Wi-Fi can solve dead spots in homes more efficiently. By taking advantage of two or more router-like devices, a mesh Wi-Fi network acts as multiple Wi-Fi extenders that blanket your house in Wi-Fi.
* Creating or extending a mesh network might require that each router and node be from the same manufacturer. “If you’re setting up or extending a mesh network, check the requirements of your mesh router to learn about compatibility with other routers or nodes,” says Apple.
* An AirPort device can be set up as a Wi-Fi extender, but this often comes at the expense of wireless network throughout and speed. AirPort appliances do not support mesh networking.
* When setting up your router, refer to a separate Apple support document outlining recommended settings for Wi-Fi routers and access points for all Macs and iOS devices that will give you the best performance, security and reliability when using Wi-Fi.
* Although Apple is discontinuing its base stations, the company will continue supporting existing customers with important security updates. The $99 AirPort Express, the $199 AirPort Extreme and the $299 AirPort Time Capsule will be available through Apple.com, Apple’s retail stores and Apple Authorized Resellers “while supplies last.”
