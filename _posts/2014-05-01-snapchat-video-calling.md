title: Snapchat picks up live video chatting and text messaging
---
* The controversial ephemeral photo sharing service Snapchat has received a major update today bringing out a text messaging feature conveniently named Chat, plus another one called Here which allows you to engage in live video chats with other users.
* To start chatting, just swipe right on a friend’s name in your Snapchat inbox. Yes, the service will immediately clear all message exchange upon leaving the chat screen, leaving no traces of your communication session.
* How to get snapchat update? Well, the update should land on the App Store later today so keep your eyes peeled..
* So how do you start live video with someone?
* First, you need to be in the conversation view. From there, just tap and hold the blue photo button to start a live video chat.
* Snapchat writes:
* We let you know when a friend is Here in your Chat so that you can give each other your full attention. And if you’re both Here, simply press and hold to share live video – and Chat face-to-face!
* To switch between your front and rear camera, swipe up or down.

* As a really cool touch, you can see yourself in the background on the login page!
* Check out these new features in the video below.
* Again, as Snapchat was originally conceived as an app for sharing disappearing pictures, your photos and text messages get deleted by default, too.
* “You keep what you want, and we’ll get rid of everything else,” as the blog posts says.
* Download Snapchat free in the App Store. If your iPhone doesn’t offer the Snapchat upgrade yet, you might want to delete the app and install it from this link.
