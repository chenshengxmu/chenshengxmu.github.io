* According to a post by an anonymous user named “Foxconninsider” that surfaced Wednesday morning on Reddit, Apple is allegedly working with a startup called Sonder on a next-generation Magic Keyboard that’s supposedly outfitted with an individual e-ink display on every single key.
* Having e-ink-enhanced keys would let the graphics on each individual key change depending on the app currently in use. To me, that sounds a lot like an OLED strip that the rumor-mill believes will be debuting on the next MacBook Pro.
* The poster, who claims to work at Tsinghua University (it’s “like the Chinese MIT”), added that Apple is currently in the process of acquiring Sonder.
* BGR has more:
* “Foxconninsider” says that Foxconn hosted a closed-doors event at the University recently, during which representatives from the manufacturing giant allegedly showed off prototypes of two unreleased Apple products.
* Foxconn, of course, is Apple’s key manufacturing partner that assembles many of its devices at its various facilities scattered in China, Taiwan and elsewhere.
* The below video of Sonder’s current e-ink keyboard gives you an idea of what might be expected from the next Magic Keyboard.
* “Foxconninsider” claimed in another post that the rumored Apple keyboard refresh could use a color e-ink display on each key instead of a grayscale one.
* He added that Foxconn also had on display a “new Macbook keyboard module” that should appear on the next MacBook Pro (he’s likely referring to the rumored OLED touch bar replacing the row of function keys).
* For what it’s worth, Reddit moderators who saw evidence “Foxconninsider” provided have vouched for him and confirmed his identity.

* The new keyboard is reportedly coming sometime in 2018.
* The current Magic Keyboard costs $99 a pop and was last refreshed alongside other Magic accessories in October 2015 with a built-in lithium-ion battery, Bluetooth 4.0 with pairing via Lightning, a Lightning port for recharging, San Francisco typeface on the keys, sleek new design and more.
