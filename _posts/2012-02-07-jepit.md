title: Alter Your App Switching Animations With 'Jepit'

* Jepit is a jailbreak tweak that attempts to add new app switching animations to your iDevice.
* Along with animations, Jepit also includes the ability to change the speed of said animations.
* Sadly, its lack of polish hinders what could otherwise be an eye catching tweak. Take a look as we go one-on-one with Jepit inside…
* The stock iOS app switching animation features a horizontal wrap-around motion that hides the previous app behind the newly selected app. Jepit adds onto this stock animation and allows you to add additional effects — app fade, vertical, vertical stretch, and horizontal stretch being among them.
* Sadly, not all of the animations work, and some of the ones that do are mislabeled, misspelled, or a combination of the two.
* In addition to animations, Jepit allows you to adjust the speed of an animation. Again, I had some very mixed results with this; some worked well, while others didn’t work at all.
* The bottom line is that Jepit is a tweak that needed a few additional coats of polish before it was released. It’s hard to recommend using it for free, let alone paying the $1.59 asking price.
* What do you think?
