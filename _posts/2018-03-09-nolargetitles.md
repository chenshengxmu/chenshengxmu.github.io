* When Apple released iOS 11 last year, one of the first things I noticed and didn’t particularly adore were those unnecessarily-large titles that show up at the tops of various stock apps.
* Assuming your iOS 11 device has been jailbroken with Electra, you can now install a new free jailbreak tweak called NoLargeTitles by iOS developer CoolStar to do away with these unsightly titles and revert to how things looked in iOS 10 and earlier.
* In the screenshot examples above, you can see how the tweak works its magic in the Settings app. The first screenshot shows the bold “Settings” title as it appears at the top of the Settings app on a stock device, while the second depicts how NoLargeTitles scales it down to look more like it would in iOS 10.
* Citing NoLargeTitles’ Cydia description, the tweak works throughout the operating system. That said, it should similarly impact other stock apps like the App Store, Mail, Music, and Photos, among others.
* With no options to configure, NoLargeTitles couldn’t be easier to use, and it should be compatible with all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* If you’re ready to rid yourself of those obnoxious bold titles seen throughout iOS 11, then you can download NoLargeTitles for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* Do you like iOS 11’s stock bold titles, or do you prefer the look and feel after installing NoLargeTitles? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.
