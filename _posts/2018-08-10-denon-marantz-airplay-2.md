* An updated version of AirPlay, Apple’s peer-to-peer media streaming technology, finally arrived alongside iOS 11.4 in March 2018 and now audio specialists Denon and Marantz have brought our AirPlay 2 support in select AV receivers via a firmware update.
* Denon’s X3500H receiver now does AirPlay 2 with a little help from a firmware update available through the company’s online forums. Marantz’s AV7704 home theater pre-amp is also getting its own AirPlay 2 firmware update.
* Marantz recently unveiled the SR5013, a 7.1 channel AV receiver with Amazon Alexa capability and AirPlay 2 support, pictured top of post. And earlier in August, they announced the new SR6013 system, a 9.1 channel AV receiver with AirPlay 2 built-in.
* Neither company’s website has formally announced availability of the updates at post time. In case you missed it, Denon and Marantz merged back in 2002, forming D+M Group. The group was acquired by Sound United in 2017, bringing it under the same roof as Polk Audio and Boston Acoustics.
* Other Hi-Fi vendors promised AirPlay support, including Bang & Olufsen, Libratone and Naim.
