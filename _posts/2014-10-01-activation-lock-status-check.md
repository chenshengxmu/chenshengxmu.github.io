* Apple recently released a tool that lets anyone check the Activation Lock status of iOS devices. Introduced along iOS 7, Activation Lock is a security feature that prevents anyone from erasing or activating your iOS device without entering your Apple ID and password first. The feature must be disabled before a device is passed or sold to another person. Failure to do so renders the device unusable for the new owner.
* With the release of this new tool, Apple wants to make the process of checking for Activation Lock easier, and prevent people from buying a device that might have been locked because it was lost, stolen, or simply because the previous owner forgot remove the device from his account.
* Turned on by default on any iOS device with iCloud enabled, this security feature has actually been praised by law enforcement agencies for curbing iPhone thefts in certain metropolitan areas.
* By going to iCloud.com/ActivationLock, anyone can enter the IMEI or Serial Number of an iOS device to check its status. If the device is locked, a message clarifies that the current user’s Apple ID and password will be required before anyone else can activate and use the device.

* If Activation Lock is turned off, then Apple gives the green light, noting the device is ready to set up and use.
* Although there are already other ways to check the Activation Lock status of a device, this tool will undoubtedly be useful to anyone about to purchase a new iOS device, assuming they know about the existence of this webpage. It is unclear when Apple made this Activation Lock check available but it appears to be very recent.
