* Today I was able to go hands-on with Reveal — a jailbreak tweak that allows you to view more text for your banner and Lock screen notifications.
* As it stands, stock notifications aren’t nearly as useful as they should be, because you can only view an extremely truncated version of the message contained within the notification.
* Reveal aims to change this by allowing you to horizontally scroll on banner notifications, vertically scroll on Lock screen notifications, and more.
* Take a look at our hands-on video walkthrough inside…
* Along with the horizontal banner scrolling and vertical scrolling on the Lock screen bubble notifications, there’s also a feature of Reveal that allows you to tap and enlarge the table cell view. See our video for a visual display of what we mean.
* One thing that you should note is that lengthy notifications for 3rd party apps are truncated a bit by iOS itself, so if you don’t see the entirety of a message in your notifications, it’s a result of how iOS works. On the other hand, Apple’s stock apps have no limit on the amount of text that can appear within push notifications.
* If you’re looking for a way to make your notifications more useful, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download Reveal for $1.99.
* What do you think?
