* Folks that are really into customizing the look and feel of their iOS devices will be happy to hear that a new tweak just hit Cydia this week that will enable them to take things a step further.
* Animer, by Hashbang Productions, is a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to customize the animations for a handful of features in iOS including notification banners, and the app switcher…
* Once installed, Animer can be accessed through your Settings app. The UI is straightforward, with the menu showing just 3 tabs: Notification Banners, Alerts, and Multitasking Switcher.
* Tapping on any one of these tabs takes you to their configurations pane where you can tweak their settings. Options include style, speed and zoom, and you can preview the changes instantly.
* Here’s a video of Animer in action:
* I’m more of a minimalist kind of guy myself, so I don’t install tweaks that have to do with iOS animations and things of that nature. They’re not necessary, and in my experience, slow things down.
* But that’s not to say that you can’t do some cool stuff with tweaks like Animer. And if you’re into that sort of thing, you should definitely check it out. It’s in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for $0.99.
* Have you tried Animer yet? What’d you think?
