* Yesterday, we brought you a full review of a hot new jailbreak tweak called Mirmir (formerly Mimir). This is a new tweak that allows you to have true side-by-side windowed multitasking on jailbroken iPhones and iPads running iOS 8.3 or iOS 8.4.
* If you’d like to try Mirmir, you can get it today for $3.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Watch our video review in this post if you’d like more info before you buy.
* In our Mirmir review we alluded to the fact that this tweak runs best on the iPad Air 2, since it has the RAM needed to deal with multiple app windows. I was able to run it on my 6 Plus, but not without slowdown and a little processor heat.
* Will you buy Mirmir? If so, how do you plan on putting it to use?
