* For those that missed it this morning, p0sixspwn was updated to fix a few major bugs from the previous release. The untethered jailbreak, released for devices on iOS 6.1.3-6.1.5 by winocm and iH8Sn0w, should no longer create issues with iMessage or LTE.
* Interestingly enough, the update also adds support for the Apple TV 2 (still no Apple TV 3). So while I donâ€™t think you can use it to directly jailbreak the set-top box, it shouldnâ€™t be too long before a utility like Seas0nPass takes advantage of the new capabilityâ€¦Â 
* Hereâ€™sÂ iH8Sn0w with the announcement:
* p0sixspwn untether was updated to 1.3-2 in Cydia (Fixes LTE/iMessage bugs). Go to changes and tap Refresh to grab it.

* It also adds AppleTV2 support for the lovely @nitoTV ðŸ˜›

* And hereâ€™s NitoTV with a few more details:
* @RogerWiddowson you need to use somethin like seasonpass or snowbreeze to jailbreak then apply the untether. it hasnt been bundled in rls yt

* So weâ€™ll still have to wait a bit for the actual Apple TV jailbreak to hit, but folks with devices on iOS 6.1.x firmware who have been having trouble with LTE (or really anything else) after jailbreaking with the original p0sixspwn should update to the new version in Cydia.
