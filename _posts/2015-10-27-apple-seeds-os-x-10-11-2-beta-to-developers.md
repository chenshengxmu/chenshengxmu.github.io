* Along with the release of iOS 9.2 beta 1, Apple has seeded a new OS X beta to developers. The beta, OS X 10.11.2, comes with a build number of 15C27e.
* It’s only been 6 days since the public edition of the prior version of Apple’s desktop OS, OS X 10.11.1, was released. Unlike today’s earlier iOS update, Apple is being fairly mum about the contents of its new beta for El Capitan.

* Here is what Apple says in its release notes for OS X 10.11.2:
* And that’s pretty much it. Maybe that’s truly all there is to report at this time, and it’s likely that this is just a bug fix release and nothing more.
* Along with the El Capitan beta, Apple also released a new beta version of its Configurator software, which is used to deploy similarly or identically configured iOS devices en masse.
* There’s no word on when Apple will release a public beta version of OS X 10.11.2, but if and when it does, we’ll be sure to let you know.
