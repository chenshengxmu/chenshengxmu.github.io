* I have thousands and thousands of photos on my Mac that I rarely get to look at. Every once in a while, I’ll go into iPhoto to backup my iPhone photos locally and start looking through past images, but that’s a rare occurrence.
* I’ve realized that one way to put these thousands of images to good use is to actually use them as my screen saver. I know most iDB readers know how to do that, but I thought I’d still share the tip. Whether you already know how to set up your iPhoto library as a screen saver or not, this post might just be a good reminder that you can actually do that and get to enjoy your photos in a very passive way…

* My screen saver is set to start after 10 minutes of inactivity. I must admit that on more than one occasion, I just sat at my desk looking at the pictures going through my screen saver. As I said, it’s a very passive way to look at some old and recent pictures.
