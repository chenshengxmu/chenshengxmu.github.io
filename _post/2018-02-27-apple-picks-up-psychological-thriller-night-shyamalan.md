* Indian-born Manoj Nelliyattu “M. Night” Shyamalan is heading to Apple.
* Entertainment trade publication Variety reported Tuesday that Apple has given a straight-to-series order to a psychological thriller written by Tony Basgallop and executive produced by Ashwin Rajan and Shyamalan, who will also direct the first episode.
* This project will mark the writer-director’s second foray into television.
* The half-hour series has received a 10-episode order, but plot details are being kept under wraps. Jason Blumenthal, Todd Black and Steve Tisch of Escape Artists will also executive produce, with Taylor Latham co-executive producing.
* Shyamalan is well known for his work on many award-winning movies, most notably the 1996 supernatural horror thriller “The Sixth Sense”, the 2002 science fiction horror “Signs”, the 2000 superhero thriller “Unbreakable”, the 2004 historical drama-horror flick “The Village”, the 2015 found footage horror “The Visit” and the 2016 psychological horror “Split”.
* This is the latest in a string of Apple projects that are heading into production.
* Previously, the Cupertino technology giant reportedly gave a straight-to-series order for an anthology series focusing on immigrants in the United States.
* It’s also hired Gaumont Television executive Carol Trussell as its head of original video production. She has joined the company’s growing Worldwide Video Programming division headed by former Sony Pictures Television executives Jamie Ehrlicht and Zack Van Amburg.
