* A sketchy order assembly sheet leaked out by Twitter account @The_Malignant reaffirms many of the previously talked-about features that should come to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come this fall, including a 256-gigabyte capacity model and the lack of the widely criticized 16-gigabyte tier. First spotted by AppleInsider, note that the sheet doesn’t bear any clear designation identifying Apple as the client.
* According to the sheet, Toshiba will supply NAND flash chips for some 256GB iPhone 7 units, with an unknown manufacturer providing memory chips for other storage tiers.
* As noted by Apple Insider, designations on the printed circuit board depicted on the assembly sheet appear to follow a general Apple guidance for format, “but also mirror that of other Foxconn clients.”
* It’s unclear if the rumored 256GB tier will be offered across the entire lineup or be exclusive to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model, which should also have 3GB of RAM due to the dual-lens camera’s increased compute requirements.
* The same Twitter account previously posted images of a claimed logic board that suggested the possibility of fast-charge technology for the next iPhone.
