* If you weren’t able to watch the live stream of the event yesterday, Apple has made the whole video available for download from iTunes. Clocking at 2 hours and 3 minutes, the HD video goes over the announcement of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch.
* Up until now, you were only able to stream the video of the event from Apple’s website, which of course depends on an internet connection. Available as a standalone download, the video of the event is now available in the Podcasts section of iTunes. You can download it here.
