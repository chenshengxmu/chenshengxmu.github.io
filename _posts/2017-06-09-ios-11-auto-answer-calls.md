* Many iOS 11 features seem to be inspired by the jailbreak community. Among them, a brand new call audio routing option in accessibility settings that allows you to set your iPhone to automatically answer incoming calls on your behalf, should you wish so.
* This optional feature supports regular calls via your carrier’s mobile network, as well as Wi-Fi calls, FaceTime audio and video calls and any VoIP calls originating from third-party apps that use Apple’s CallKit framework, such as WhatsApp, Skype, Viber and more.
* To enable this feature, go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Call Audio Routing.
* There, you’ll see the call routing options which include settings like Bluetooth headsets, the iPhone speaker and more. These options are also available on prior iOS editions. But look at the bottom and you’ll see a brand new menu, labeled Auto-Answer Calls.

* Tapping it takes you to a new screen where you can enable or disable the feature and set the duration of time your iPhone will wait when a call comes in before it’s auto-answered for you.

* This handy new option, as I already mentioned, is nowhere to be found in iOS 10.
* I can see myself using Auto-Answer Calls a lot, not just while jogging with my AirPods or working out with my PowerBeats in my ears but also in other situations when interacting with the phone may be impractical, like driving a car or swimming with my Apple Watch on.
* How do you like this nifty new feature in iOS 11? When iOS 11 releases publicly later this fall, will you be using this new auto-answer call setting, and why?
