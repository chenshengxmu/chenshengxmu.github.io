* The tabbing experience on Mac might feel a little gimped if you’re coming from a Windows machine. That’s because, by default, macOS makes it so that the option to move keyboard focus between all controls with the Tab key is disabled.
* Instead, tabbing is only possible between text boxes and lists using the default setting. In this tutorial, I’ll show you two quick and easy ways to change this setting and enable a much-improved tabbing experience on your Mac.
* The main reason why you’d want to enable this feature is to make navigating your Mac easier. Using the keyboard usually offers a faster way to get things done and being able to switch between buttons using the Tab key just makes sense.
* Step 1: Open System Preferences → Keyboard
* Step 2: Click the Shortcuts tab
* Step 3: Click the All controls radio button
* Alternatively, you can use a simple keyboard shortcut—Control (⌃)+F7—to enable All controls for keyboard focus when tabbing.
* Please watch the video above as I demonstrate the difference between these two modes. It’s hard to explain why this option is so desirable without seeing the differences in action, but in a nutshell, it makes it possible to access buttons using the Tab key that you couldn’t before. I certainly recommend using the all controls setting, as it’s one of the first things that I do when setting up a new Mac.
* Do you use this option on your Mac? Sound off with your thoughts and opinions down below.
