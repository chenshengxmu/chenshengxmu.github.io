* If you have purchased Apple’s new MacBook Pro, or are planning on doing so, chances are you’re going to need some dongles and adapters. The laptop has only USB-C ports, so you’re likely going to need some help connecting your old hardware and peripherals.
* With this in mind, we’ve decided to put together a list of some common USB-C adapters to help get you started. As with all of our accessory roundups, the following items were chosen based on a variety of factors including price, availability and consumer feedback.

* Looking to connect your new MacBook Pro to a display or projector that uses a Mini DisplayPort adapter? Check out this adapter from AllSmartLife. It’s made of aluminum for durability, and it supports both audio and 4K video up to 3840*2160. It’s worth noting that reviews are mixed, with some customers reporting that their adapters were DOA or didn’t seem compatible with their hardware, but it’s a fairly inexpensive risk to take and of course Amazon has a nice return policy.
* Buy for $17.

* Apple didn’t kill the Ethernet port with its new MacBook Pro—it’s been gone for a while now—but there are some people who still need one on their laptop. This adapter from Aukey gives you that, allowing you to connect your MacBook Pro to wired Gigabit networks. It supports ultrafast 10/100/1000Mbps speeds and comes with a 24-month warranty.
* Buy for $15.

* Here’s an easy, inexpensive way to connect your USB-C laptop to a high def monitor or TV. Similar to the above memory card reader, USB-C to HDMI adapters are pretty easy to find, but we again went with Aukey for its 24-month warranty and positive customer reviews. Supports 4K and comes with software drivers for better compatibility.
* Buy for $25.

* For a lot of people, the USB-C to USB-A adapter is probably going to be the most common. USB-A is your standard USB connector used to plug peripherals like external hard drives, thumb drives, phone sync/charging cables and more into your computer. This one from Cable Matters supports USB 3.1 data transfer rates up to 5Gbps and is backwards compatible. Comes with a lifetime warranty.
* Buy for $7.
