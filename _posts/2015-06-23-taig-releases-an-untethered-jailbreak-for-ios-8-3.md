* A jailbreak has been released for iOS 8.3 by the TaiG team. This jailbreak supports iOS 8.1.3 through iOS 8.3 and is Windows only.
* See: How to jailbreak iOS 8.3
* The tool, which is dubbed TaiG 2.0, can be downloadedÂ right now from our downloads page.
* This release is quite interesting, since it was thought that the Pangu team would be the one to release a jailbreak for iOS 8.3 and TaiG would focus on iOS 9. That, obviously, is no longer the case.
* Keep in mind that lots of things still need to be updated for iOS 8.3, including Cydia Substrate. Thus, support is limited with regard to jailbreak tweaks and apps.
* Also, some jailbreakers are experiencing hangups at the 20% progress mark. Are you?
* Stay tuned for more coverages and a full tutorial.
