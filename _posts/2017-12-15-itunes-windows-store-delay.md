* Apple’s iTunes app won’t be making its scheduled debut on Windows Store this year after all.
* iTunes was supposed to launch on Windows Store before the end of this year, with the Redmond giant event teasing its arrival with a Windows Store banner as far back as May 2017.
* Apple has now confirmed to ZDNet that iTunes won’t make it into Windows Store this year, as originally promised during Microsoft’s Build conference in May this year.
* “We have been working with Microsoft to deliver the full iTunes experience to our customers and we need a little more time to get it right,” said an Apple spokesperson via an emailed statement without revealing what specifically is holding this up.
* According to author Mary Jo Foley, the plans still remain for iTunes to hit Microsoft’s app store at some point, but neither Apple nor Microsoft provided any updated timing.
* This is bad news for both companies, even more so considering iTunes’ popularity and the fact that Windows 10 S runs only sanctioned Windows Store apps. iTunes is one of the apps Windows 10 S users search for on Microsoft’s store most frequently.
* Of course, users of regular Windows editions can manually download iTunes from Apple at any time, something their Windows 10 S counterparts are unable to do because Windows 10 S is a slimmed-down version of Windows that can only run apps available in Microsoft Store.
* Hosting iTunes on Windows Store would also make it easier for Windows users to find the app.
