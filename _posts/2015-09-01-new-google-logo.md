* As part of its massive restructuring effort, the Internet giant Google on Tuesday showed off its brand new logo. While the Mountain View company has refined its logo multiple times over the past seventeen years, today’s announcement marks the biggest visual change to Google’s brand identity thus far.
* The new logo reflects the fact that people now interact with Google across many different platforms, apps and devices, the company argues.
* Check out the new logo and identity family and tell us in comments how you liked them.
* The new logo is still a word mark like the old one, but it’s now based on a sans-serif typeface and slightly softer colors. A smaller variant of the old Google logo featuring the tiny letter “g” has been replaced with an uppercase four-color “G”.
* It was created to show you “when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens,” explains Google. The new typeface resembles the LTCircular font used on the Alphabet announcement page. The old logo was based on the Catull serif typeface.

* The search company is also introducing brand new animations and other elements to convey how Google is working for you. One example involves a colorful Google mic icon which is now animated to help you identify and interact with Google whether you’re talking, tapping or typing.

* “Google has changed a lot over the past 17 years—from the range of our products to the evolution of their look and feel—and today we’re changing things up once again,” said the firm.
* This new visual identity is now live on Google.com and will be gradually rolling out across all Google properties.
* “This isn’t the first time we’ve changed our look and it probably won’t be the last, but we think today’s update is a great reflection of all the ways Google works for you across Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome and many others,” Google wrote.
* How do you like the new logo and animations?
