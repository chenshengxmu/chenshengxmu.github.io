title: 'SpeakEvents' makes boring push notifications come alive with voice

* SpeakEvents is a jailbreak tweak that audibly speaks the contents of new messages, tweets, emails, etc.
* I like to look at it as the opposite of Siri; actually it’s the perfect complement to Siri, because instead of you talking to the iPhone, it’s talking to you.
* I know this sounds like a potential recipe for disaster, but SpeakEvents has the ability to go into quiet mode during designated times, and you can make it work on a per-app basis.
* Check out further video coverage of SpeakEvents straight ahead…
* SpeakEvents works by waiting for incoming push notifications from the apps you configure it to listen for. It will then speak any incoming push notifications if all criteria is met.
* Along with notifications from apps, SpeakEvents can speak the time at the top of each hour, give you battery life status updates, and speak in silent mode if you desire it to do so.
* My main gripe with SpeakEvents is one that all will no doubt share: the registration process. It’s not enough to just purchase and download the tweak. SpeakEvents relies on a license which you must purchase via PayPal. It’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s certainly not the convenience we’re all used to.
* If your device is jailbroken and running iOS 5, you can head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download it today. Licenses will set you back $1.99 AUD, which is about $2.14 USD.
* Now that you’ve seen it in action, what do you think about SpeakEvents?
