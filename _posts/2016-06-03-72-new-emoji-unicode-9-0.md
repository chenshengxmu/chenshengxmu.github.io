* The Unicode Consortium has settled on a batch of new emoji characters that will become part of the Unicode 9.0 standard, to be released formally on June 21. The final emoji candidates for inclusion in Unicode 9.0 include such emoji as a man in tuxedo, lying face, clown face, drooling face, nauseated face, rolling on the floor laughing, selfie, face palm, pregnant woman, first place medal, shopping trolley, deer, shark, owl, potato, croissant, pancakes, bacon, judo uniform and more.
* The full list of the 72 new emojis in Unicode 9.0 is as follows:
* These are final candidates that’ll be officially supported when Unicode 9.0 releases on June 21. Apple’s software platforms currently support Unicode 8.0. Major new versions of iOS, OS X, tvOS and watchOS, to be previewed at WWDC this month, should gain support for Unicode 9.0 and implement these new emojis.
* Yesterday, Facebook pushed an update to its Messenger app for iOS and Android with a total of 1,500 stunning emoji images included in the release although not all of the current emojis in the Unicode standard are included.
