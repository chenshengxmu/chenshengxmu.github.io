* Apple has seeded the first iOS 9.2.1 beta for iOS devices to developers. The beta ships with build number 13D11, and comes eight days after the public release of iOS 9.2 back on December 8th.
* The download is now available for iPads, iPhones, and the iPod touch on Apple’s Developer Member Center. No change details are currently available, but we will update you once details emerge.
* As indicated by its minor version number increase, this is likely a small bug fix release, and as such, Apple may not even release change details for the update. Last week’s release of iOS 9.2 was significant and featured a lengthy change log, so it’s possible that the changes brought to the table with that release warranted a few bug fixes.
