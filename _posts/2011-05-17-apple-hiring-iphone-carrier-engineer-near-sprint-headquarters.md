* With the iPhone already available on AT&T, Verizon and being tested on T-Mobile USA currently, Sprint might be getting some iPhone love this year as well.
* According to a new Apple job posting, Apple is on the lookout for a “Carrier Engineer” located in the Kansas City, Missouri area to work with carriers on technical issues. Coincidentally, Sprint headquarters is located in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas… 
* “Location Kansas City, MO … Member of the Carrier Engineering team that supports taking products through technical approval at the carriers. A Carrier Engineer team is responsible for day-to-day technical interactions with the one or more carriers to track down issues reported by the carrier, assist the carrier with testing they might be conducting and working with program management, software development and test teams to get products approved by the carriers.”
* While the job listing was posted on April 2nd, this news doesn’t come as a surprise. Last week, industry analyst Peter Misek from Jefferies & Company reported that Apple would bring the iPhone to both T-Mobile USA and Sprint this year. This move would bring the iPhone to all four major U.S carriers, which could significantly decrease Android sales.
* Would you switch to Sprint or T-Mobile if they got the iPhone?
* [Stop it, AT&T]
