* We all have VIPs; those very important people. And, Apple gives us a very special place to keep messages from them in the Mail app. This makes it easy to see emails from those people you designate as VIPs, all in one spot.
* If you haven’t used this feature yet, or are new to iOS or macOS, here’s how to add and also remove people from your VIP mailbox.
* You have two different ways to add VIPs on your iOS device. First, with your Mail app open, open a message from a sender you want to add to your VIPs.
* 1) To the right of the sender’s name (or email), tap the arrow.
* 2) On the next screen, tap Add to VIP.
* 3) Tap Done.

* You are then taken back to the email and can see a star next to the sender indicating they are a VIP.
* If you want to remove that sender as a VIP later:
* 1) To the right of the sender’s name (or email), tap the arrow.
* 2) On the next screen, tap Remove from VIP.
* 3) Tap Done.
