* If you’re a fan of the Location Services feature on your iPhone or iPad, you can use this on your Apple TV too. See movie times at your local theater, order pizza delivery, or get your current temperate with apps and other services using your location.

* You’ll see on the Location Services screen under Location Services if you already have them enabled. Click to turn on or off Location Services here.
* Below that, you can read Apple’s full description of what Locations Services are and how they work. In a nutshell and like on your iPhone or iPad, Location Services are used to obtain and provide information based on your location.

* For example, if you use a weather app, you can enable Location Services to get the current conditions and forecast for your spot. Or, if you’re using an app to find a house for sale in your town, Location Services can help the provider give you that information.
* Just be aware that even though enabling Location Services can be helpful in giving you information, details can also be returned to the app provider. Check out our articles about iOS Location Services or those built into your Mac for further reading on the topic.
* The next set of options are items included with your Apple TV and you can decide whether to use Location Services for them or not and when. These options include Siri and Dictation, Time Zone, Aerial (screen saver), and HomeKit.

* When you click each one, you’ll see different options depending on the service. For instance, Time Zone lets you decide whether to use your Location Services always or never, while Aerial lets you pick from always, while using the app, or never.
* Just click each of these to make your selection for when to use Location Services.

* The last section within Location Services is for third-party apps that you have installed on your Apple TV. As mentioned above and shown in the screenshot below, you may have apps like the weather that use your location to provide you information.
