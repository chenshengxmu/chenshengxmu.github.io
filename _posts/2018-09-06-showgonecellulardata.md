* Unlimited data plans are everywhere these days, but a significant percentage of the population still uses capped plans. Anyone in the latter category likely pays closer attention to their monthly data usage than unlimited users do. But in any case, iOS’ native cellular data monitoring system leaves a lot to be desired.
* Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called ShowGoneCellularData by iOS developer Kevin Muller can help. This tweak compels iOS to display detailed cellular data usage stats for apps you’ve previously removed.
* If you’re anything like me, then you probably download and delete apps on your handset as quickly as you learn about them online. The problem here is that iOS shows how much data your uninstalled apps have used, but it doesn’t break things down in an easy-to-understand format. This inevitably leads to misunderstandings.
* After you install ShowGoneCellularData, the section under Settings → Cellular → Uninstalled Apps becomes tappable. Upon opening it, you’ll find a full list of apps you’ve uninstalled and the amount of data each one used.
* How’s that for detailed? It’s certainly better than seeing a lump-sum figure and having no idea which apps used the most of that data.
* While it’d be nice if Apple offered this feature right out of the box, it’s clear that Apple hasn’t thought that far ahead. That said, you treat yourself to this feature right now by installing ShowGoneCellularData from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for free.
* Keep in mind that ShowGoneCellularData is only intended for jailbroken iOS 11 devices. It may work on earlier versions of iOS, but we have no way of testing this for sure. That said, you install this tweak on iOS 10 and earlier at your own risk.
* Do you think it’s handy to see the amount of cellular data your uninstalled apps have used? Let us know in the comments section below.
