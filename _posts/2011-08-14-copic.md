* I love jailbreak utilities that add contact photos to stock iOS apps. It makes your contacts seem more like real people, rather than pieces of data.
* Cydia provides a couple of options to pull this off. SMSEnhancer adds contact photos to the Messages app, and IPicMyContacts does the same for your contact list. And then there’s Copic, which actually does what the other two tweaks do, and more….
* Copic, short for Contact Picture, describes itself as an all-in-one application that shows contact pictures “everywhere in your iDevice.” The utility works with the Phone, Messages and Contact apps.
* Not only does Copic take the place of the aforementioned utilities, it also adds a couple of features. It embeds photos into both the recent call and Favorites lists on the iPhone, and even supports the FaceTime application on the iPad 2 and iPod Touch.
* Like most tweaks, Copic doesn’t add an icon to your springboard. Once installed, simply pop into your Settings app to start customizing. If you want to try it out, Copic is available in Cydia for $1.29.
* Have you tried Copic yet?
