* If iPhone apps like Instagram and Camera+ aren’t producing photos up to your standards, there’s a new title that might be worth checking out. 645 PRO, by Michael Hardaker, describes itself as “the photography professional’s iPhone camera.”
* Loaded with tons of high-end features like a real-time ISO and shutter speed reader, and a live histogram, the app promises unparalleled image quality. It even claims to produce “developed RAW” TIFF files and “lossless” JPEG images…
* From the App Store description:
* “645 PRO has been designed, from the group up, for professional and serious amateur photographers. So it works the way a camera works, not some piece of computer software.
* Every setting is managed directly from the camera — no layers of menus to negotiate. You have instant access to everything that can be controlled, from focus/exposure and white balance locking to a 645 PRO-exclusive choice between spot and multi-zone metering.”
* Obviously, if you’re not familiar with these features, the app probably won’t appeal to you. But if you’re an amateur photographer or an aspiring professional looking for an iPhone camera app that will give you more control over your picture-taking, it looks like a winner.
* You can download 645 PRO from the App Store for $2.99. It’s optimized for the iPhone 4S, but works just fine on the iPhone 4.
* Has anyone tried this new camera app? Thoughts?
