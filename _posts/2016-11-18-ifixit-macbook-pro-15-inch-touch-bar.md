* iFixit on Friday published its teardown analysis of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (model number A1707), just two days after taking a peek under the hood of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Comparing the two Touch Bar-equipped notebooks to the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, which iFixit also disassembled, the repair site has confirmed that only the baseline 13-incher with a standard row of function keys has a removable SSD.
* Like on the 13-incher, this machine’s processor, RAM and flash memory are soldered to the logic board, meaning that the SSD is impossible to remove or upgrade.
* Curiously enough, iFixit has discovered a hidden connector inside the machine that leads “nowhere,” speculating it could be for SSD data rescue in case of hardware failure.
* “Based on our previous teardown, we’re speculating Apple included an access port for the integrated SSD,” explains iFixit. “Not a bad idea when it’s impossible to physically salvage your data out of a damaged machine.”

* And:
* We’d still rather see a removable/upgradeable SSD, particularly in a machine targeted at pros—but this way if your logic board bites the dust, there might at least be a chance of recovering your data with Apple’s help. Keep making those backups though.
* The same connector was found in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.
* Other notable findings from the teardown analysis:
* Here’s the notebook’s trackpad compared to the iPad mini.

* And here’s a closeup of the Apple-designed T1 chip that handles Touch ID/Apple Pay/webcam security an drives the Touch Bar, as seen on the notebook’s mustache-shaped logic board overlaid on top of Apple’s promotional graphics.

* It’s basically the same spot that Apple’s marketing materials claim the T1 chip is. To iFixit, that came as something of a surprise considering there’s three similar chips peppered over the rest of the logic board.
* In addition to both the 13 and 15-inch Touch Bar-outfitted machines not having a removable SSD, they also have non-upgradeable RAM and have their battery “solidly glued down”, which greatly inhibits repairs and recycling.
* iFixit gave both the 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro a 1/10 on its repairability scale.
