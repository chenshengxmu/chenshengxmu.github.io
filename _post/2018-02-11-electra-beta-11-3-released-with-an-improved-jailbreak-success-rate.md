* Another update to CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 is now available. Beta 11-3 brings improvements that should significantly improve the success rate of jailbreaking with Electra.
* The following changelog comes directly from the official Electra website:

* Notably, CoolStar just released Electra beta 11-2 a couple of days ago with significant improvements to jailbreakd’s reliability. Beta 11-3 is a minor update over beta 11-2.
* Electra doesn’t include Cydia just yet, but there are plans to incorporate it into a future update. Three of Cydia’s dependencies have been updated with iOS 11-compatibility, so all that remains now is some extensive field-testing beforehand.
* Notably, Saurik said he’s working on an official iOS 11 update for both Cydia and Mobile Substrate, but there’s no ETA for it at this point in time.
* If you’re interested in giving Electra a try, you can download the latest version from the official web page.
* Have you jailbroken your iOS 11 device with Electra yet? Let us know in the comments below.
