* RadioShack has just confirmed that it plans to start offering a steep discount on its 16GB iPhone 4S models this weekend, following the lead of several other retailers.
* Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen price drops on Apple’s latest handset from multiple outlets, including Best Buy and Walmart. And now it’s RadioShack’s turn…
* The Verge is reporting that starting August 26th — that’s tomorrow — RadioShack will be offering up the entry-level iPhone 4S for just $125. The price is good for all carriers, and is the lowest we’ve seen on the smartphone (save for Sprint’s gift card deal).
* In addition, the retailer will also be shaving $75 off of its 32GB and 64GB 4S models, thus knocking them down to $225 and $325 respectively. Obviously, all prices require a two-year contract, and from what we understand, they’re only available in-store.
* As we’ve said before, anyone that can hold off purchasing a new handset for a month is advised to do so. Even if you’re not interested in the new iPhone, Apple is likely to discount its old ones. But if you’re in a hurry to buy, this deal is definitely worth looking into.
