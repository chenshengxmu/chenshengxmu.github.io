* There are very few men in our country, better yet the world, that have the kind of following Steve Jobs has. I’m not talking about paparazzi or Twitter faithful, I’m talking about Apple fans. Fascination with Apple’s innovations and the man behind them reaches far beyond the tech world these days.
* Everyone from Wall Street to blog dwellers are constantly looking to see what the Cupertino CEO will come up with next. He has been elevated to a Willy Wonka-type status. We all wait for the day that we see smoke coming from his top secret factory and hope that he appears in his signature black turtle neck to show off his latest invention…
* Well it seems like WSJ affiliate website Barron’s has also taken note of Jobs’ super star status. Whether it is because the CEO has lead his company to be one of the top mobile phone producers in the world or because Apple’s stock has jumped nearly $80.00 per share in the last 12 months, it’s unclear.
* But one thing is certain, with over 100 million iPhones sold in the last 3 and a half years, Steve Jobs has made a brilliant CEO. In fact, according to Barron’s, he is the best one. Jobs has once again been named the best CEO in the world. This time it was by the Financial News website Barron’s, during their annual selection of the globe’s best leaders.
* Several other American’s made the list of the top 30 corporate honchos, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Alan Mullaly of Ford. Of note, BlackBerry CEO Mike Lazaridis didn’t make the list this year. If you ask me, BlackBerry desperately needs to reinvent itself to stay relevant in today’s app-oriented market. The Torch and the Playbook just aren’t going to cut it.
* But the man of the hour is Steve Jobs. Even as he is out on medical leave, the world waits in eagerness to get a glimpse of the rumored iPhone 5. People are still standing in line for his iPad 2.
* Although this isn’t the first time Jobs has received accolades for his work at Apple, I bet it still tastes just as sweet. For those who don’t remember, Jobs was voted out of Apple in 1985 and later rejoined the company in 1996 to save them from bankruptcy. The rest, as they say, is history.
* What do you think of the work Steve Jobs has done at Apple? Is he really top CEO?
