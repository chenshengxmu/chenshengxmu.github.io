* During Apple’s iPhone 5 keynote in September, Tim Cook announced that the App Store contained more than 700 thousand apps. And out of that staggering number, more than 30% of them were iPad-specific apps.
* Well apparently, Apple hit another major milestone today regarding its application ecosystem. According to a new report, the Cupertino company has now approved more than 1 million apps in the last four years…
* The Next Web points to the following tweet by Appsfire, a website devoted to App Store discovery: “Breaking: today will mark the day the App store has seen 1 million apps ever created since launch (iOS).”
* “Ouriel Ohayon, co-founder of Appsfire, provided some details of how the App Store sits today. Of the one million app submissions since 2008, 493,289 were paid and 158,848 were games. Of the 736,247 apps that are currently live 336,270 are paid (around 45 percent), while 120,065 are games (around 16 percent).”
* So where are the missing 270,000 apps? They’ve been removed from the App Store over the years, either due to the developer’s choice or copyright take downs, or any other reason Apple has chosen to pull them.
* It’s quite interesting really. As The Next Web points out, Apple won’t likely highlight this benchmark, but it still kind of gives you an idea of how successful the App Store has become since it launched back in 2008.
* In its first four years, the App Store has made some developers extremely wealthy and has set a number of software and game sales records. It’ll be interesting to see where it goes and what it does in the next four years.
