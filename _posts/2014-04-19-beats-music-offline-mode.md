* Beats Music updated its iPhone client late last night, bringing the app to version 1.0.7. The update brings about a number of improvements, including better Facebook and Twitter account management, a new Find Your Friends feature for locating and following your Facebook friends, and more.
* Perhaps the biggest change, though, is that the app now supports in-app subscriptions. This means that users now have the ability to bill their monthly subscription fee directly to their iTunes account. There’s also a new Offline listening mode and thousands of new tracks available for The Sentence…
* Here is your full 1.0.7 change log:
* What’s New in Version 1.0.7
* You asked for it, and we listened! Some highlights in this release include:  – In-app subscription and account management via your iTunes account  – Find Your Friends — find and follow your Facebook friends on Beats Music  – Improved Facebook and Twitter account management  – Thousands of new tracks available in The Sentence  – Artist Offers — discover new content and merchandise from your favorite artists  – Offline Mode & Downloading improvements  – Music Player performance fixes
* For those of you who are unfamiliar with Beats Music, it’s the latest entry in the growing pool of streaming music services. The project, spearheaded by music mogul Jimmy Lovine, launched to the public in January of this year, and has received a lukewarm reception despite some major rollout issues.

* So what separates Beats from the Spotifys and Rdios? Powerful curation features like The Sentence, which will actually pick out music for you based on where you are, what you feel like doing, who you are with, and what type of music you want to listen to. It’s described as ‘the right song at the right time.’
* Unfortunately, there is still no iPad app to be found, and no free radio service for non-paying users, but for those interested in checking it a free trial is available. The service runs $9.99 per month (with promotions for AT&T users), which you can now sign up for in-app. Beats Music is in the App Store, for free.
