* After seeding a number of betas over the past few months, Apple has finally seeded OS X 10.9.2 to the public. As expected, the update includes FaceTime Audio, new contact blocking controls for both iMessage and FaceTime and Mail fixes.
* Additionally, Apple has included a fix for the nasty SSL connection verification bug that popped up last week. So we recommend that everyone grab this new version of Mavericks by visiting the ‘Software Update’ tab in the Mac App Store…

* The SSL bug, which we detailed in this post, is pretty significant as it left OS X users vulnerable to what’s called a man-in-the-middle attack in where a malicious program poses as a trusted website to intercept communications or inject malware.
* The issue has already been patched in iOS, and Apple seeded an update to fix the problem on Apple TV this morning. And although it’s not directly mentioned in the change log above, this Mavericks release includes a fix for the bug on Mac.
* So again, if you are running on OS X 10.9 (the only affected Mac OS), we highly recommend updating to 10.9.2 as soon as possible.
