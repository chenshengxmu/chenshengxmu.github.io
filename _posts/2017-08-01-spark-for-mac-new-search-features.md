* Ukrainian developer Readdle today refreshed its award-winning Spark email app for Mac with powerful new search capabilities along with other notable improvements, such as snoozed emails syncing across devices, reduced CPU consumption and improved memory usage.
* “Fast, smart and easy to use—those are the main criteria of the perfect search for email,” developers noted. “The new Spark for Mac has them all”.
* The app now provides relevant suggestions for faster and easier searches, including visual representations of your search queries with interactive keywords allowing you to easily change the date or attachment type in just two clicks.

* The app even displays all relevant email attachments directly in your search results. This gives you a better understanding about which conversation it belongs to.
* Once you click the file, Spark opens the exact email message in the thread.

* Your snoozed emails now sync across all your devices and the app’s Quit dialog, which somethings could hang, now features improved behavior.
* Overall, the refreshed app should now use less CPU time and RAM. Lastly, Readdle has fixed an annoying issue with screenshots pasted into composer from the system clipboard.
* Spark for Mac is available on Mac App Store free of charge.
