* For several years Apple was criticized for its lack of effort to make its company and its products more eco-friendly. Steve Jobs himself felt the need to write an 1,800 word post on Apple’s website regarding the topic.
* But Apple has come a long way since then. It’s now one of the greenest electronics companies on the planet. And that’s a difficult task, considering it has to police dozens of overseas suppliers that help make its products…
* The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Chinese environmental leaders recently praised the iPhone-makers for meeting with them earlier this week to discuss pollution problems with 15 of the company’s suppliers.
* The publication passes on a statement from Ma Jun, one of China’s best-known green activists:
* “This is a major step forward. They asked these companies to take corrective plans and give a timeline, and Apple will verify whether all these issues have been resolved.”
* LiLi, another environmental activist, had similar praise for Apple, saying, “Our ability to sit down together shows they have changed and actively want to move forward on this.”
* Apple’s attitude has definitely changed. You might recall a report that the company was looking to build an enormous solar energy farm to power its recently-built data center in North Carolina.
* Whether it’s doing so for politics or brand image, or even just to fulfill its civic duty, Apple seems to be pretty committed to reducing its carbon footprint.
