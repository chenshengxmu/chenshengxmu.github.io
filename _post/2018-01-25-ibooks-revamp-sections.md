* Apple is working on a major overhaul of the iBooks app and the underlying iBooks Store centered around iOS 11’s App Store styling and all-new Audiobooks and Reading Now sections, Bloomberg reported today, and now we’re learning about other changes coming to the app.
* 9to5Mac today analyzed the iOS 11.3 developer beta code, in search for potential strings that would confirm Bloomberg’s report and hopefully add some color to it.
* For starters, here are the new iBooks Store category icons, including a new icon for the Reading Now feature mentioned in Mark Gurman’s original report for Bloomberg.

* Assets and strings unearthed from iOS 11.3’s rechristened Books app (previously called, of course, iBooks) include references to other potential sections:
* “More references to audiobooks confirm improvements in that area for the new Books app,” reads the report.
* We reported that Apple may also be working on a standalone Podcasts app for macOS, which may or may not hint at broader efforts to continue unbundling services from iTunes.
