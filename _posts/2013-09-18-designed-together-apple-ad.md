* Following the release of iOS 7 this morning, Apple has posted a new advertisement showcasing the redesigned software alongside the all-new iPhone 5c.
* The ad is entitled ‘Designed Together,’ and similar to Apple’s recent ‘Plastic Perfected’ commercial, there’s no voiceover or dialogue. Instead, all you hear is catchy background music as various elements of iOS 7 and the iPhone 5c are displayed across the screen…

* I feel like the ad works, in that it presents Apple’s big iOS update and new plastic iPhone in a favorable light. The clip is fun, bouncy, and I really think that it will appeal to the younger crowd—which is the demographic Apple appears to be targeting here.
* Whether this strategy will produce major results, however, still remains a mystery. We have yet to see any numbers regarding iPhone 5c pre-orders, and the jury is still out on what the masses will think of iOS 7. Early reviewers seem to really like both though.
