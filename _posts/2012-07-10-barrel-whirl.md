* All you have to do is just say the word Barrel, and people take note. Yes, Barrel, the staple jailbreak tweak, and arguably one of the most compelling reasons for jailbreaking your iDevice when it comes to visual modifications, has been updated.
* The new mode (transition), is called Whirl. It’s safe to say that mere screenshots don’t do Barrel, or this latest update any justice. On that note, head inside and take a look at our full video breakdown…
* We know that Barrel has been out for quite a while, but it’s remarkable to think that the developer still cares enough to provide updates from time to time. If you remain one of the few who has yet to try Barrel, then you purchase it for $2.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Do you still use Barrel on your jailbroken device? What do you think about the new “Whirl” mode?
