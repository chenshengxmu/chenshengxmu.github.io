* Earlier this month, a report surfaced claiming that music video website Vevo is developing an application for Apple TV that offers access to its 24-7 music video channel. But at the time, there were no other information available.
* The Wall Street Journal has dug a little deeper, though, and offers up some new details on the story. The outlet says that Vevo has indeed inked a deal with Apple, and the app could launch on the Apple TV as soon as this week…
* The Journal’s Hannah Karp reports:
* “Vevo, a joint venture between Sony Corp.’s 6758.TO +0.52% Sony Music Entertainment and Vivendi SA’s  VIV.FR +0.69% Universal Music Group, has signed deals to deliver on-demand music videos—plus a new channel of original, 24-hour-a-day programming—via AppleAAPL -1.31% TV set-top boxes and Samsung television sets.
* Apple Inc. could release the Vevo Apple TV app as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter, while Samsung Electronics Co.’s 005930.SE -1.02% launch is likely a few weeks away.”
* The move is part of Vevo’s strategy to get fans to watch its videos and original content though its site and apps, instead of through YouTube. Google takes a significant share of the ad revenue generated by content viewed on its site.
* The report goes on to say that Vevo’s deals with Apple and Samsung will allow it to sell ads designed specifically for TV, rather than those attached to web videos. This should allow it to attract more advertisers with bigger budgets.
* Apple has been rather busy adding content to its Apple TV in recent months. It’s just added WatchESPN and HBO GO, and it’s working on CW and Time Warner content deals. There’s also rumors of a TV announcement this fall.
