* As of this post, at about 4:45AM EST, it is 10:45AM in Amsterdam where the Hack In The Box conference is currently taking place. Just as pod2g alluded to in a previous post on his blog, it looks like the iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak will be demonstrated live at the conference, along with its highly awaited released before the conference concludes.
* The official Twitter account for the Hack In The Box Security Conference just sent out a tweet confirming “Jailbreak Live” will take place tomorrow, and they are offering special 1-day passes if you happen to be in the area and wish to watch history take place.
* What time can you expect to see the untethered jailbreak released in your neck of the woods? We analyze the likely time for the release inside…

* Since Amsterdam is 6 hours ahead of EST, and each day of the conference appears to be between 09:00~ and 18:00~ hours local time, the earliest we would see a release is at 3AM EST on Friday, May 25th. Interestingly enough, the official agenda for the conference lists actual times that members of the DevTeam and Chronic Dev Team are scheduled to present their work. The odd thing about the agenda, is that it lists the exploit as being for 5.0.1 instead of 5.1.1. This is likely a typo, unless the guys plan to talk about the exploits for the previous untethered jailbreak that happened back in January.

* The agenda lists the following times for each presentation:
* May 24th
* May 25th
* This means the Corona event will start at 5:30AM EST on Friday, May 25th, and the Absinthe event will follow shortly thereafter at 7:00 AM EST. It’s very possible that the jailbreak will be released sometime within that ballpark window. Basically, I’d definitely keep my eyes peeled on Friday morning if I were you.
* #FridayIsFunday.
