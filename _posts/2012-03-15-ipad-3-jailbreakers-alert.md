* Even though the new iPad doesn’t officially go on sale until tomorrow morning, some folks have already gotten their hands on the one. It appears that some retailers started selling the tablet around midnight tonight.
* Of course, now that it’s starting to make its way into customers hands, the big question here at iDB is: “when will it be jailbroken?” Luckily, the infamous Dev Team posted some interesting information tonight regarding the topic…
* “There are a few bits of good news already:
* That’s three different angles, and we’re not even including the continuous work @pod2g makes towards a new jailbreak! As always, keep in mind this is very preliminary progress, and it’s impossible to predict how or when these things turn out.”
* The post goes on to mention that it’s possible that some third-generation iPads are shipping with software prior to iOS 5.1. So make sure that when/if you plug the new tablet into your computer, that you do not upgrade the firmware!
* It looks like the hackers of the jailbreak community have a pretty good bead on things. And hats off to the Dev Team for keeping us up to date and informed. Now our next question is, will Saurik update Cydia with Retina graphics?
* Kidding, of course.
