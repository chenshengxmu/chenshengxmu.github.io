* Looking for some jailbreak tweaks to install on your pwned iOS 10 or 11 device? Then you’ve come to the right place.
* This roundup will encompass all the jailbreak tweaks released from May 27th until June 3rd. As usual, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorite releases in detail and then wrap things up by outlining the rest afterward.

* Cluttered Home screens can make finding particular app icons a nightmare, but LeadMeHome attempts to solve this problem by making it easier to find where your app icons reside.
* With LeadMeHome, you can simply search for an app in the Spotlight interface and then tap and hold on it – the tweak then takes you straight to the icon on your Home screen so that you can launch, move, or delete the app.
* This tweak is a lifesaver for those who install more apps than they should, and you can learn more about its potential uses in our full review.

* Monthlicon complements the default Calendar app icon with a customized label that displays the current month.
* Given how the Calendar app icon already shows the date and day of the week, Monthlicon serves as a subtle way of keeping things consistent by showing as much related information as possible.
* You can learn more about Monthlicon and why we recommend it in our full review.

* Safari is one of the best web browser experiences you can get on the iOS platform, but the smartphone version isn’t quite as multitasking-friendly as its tablet counterpart.
* The main difference comes by way of tab management; the smartphone version uses a card-based interface while the tablet version uses desktop-class tabs for organization.
* SafariPad ports this iPad-style tabbed browsing to iPhones and iPads in an attempt to increase web browsing productivity on these smaller devices.
* You can learn more about SafariPad and why it’s so essential in our full review.
