* In addition to releasing the new iOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1, tvOS 11.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 software updates earlier this morning, Apple also issued a minor iTunes update.
* It focuses on under-the-hood changes and does not contain any outward-facing changes. As per Apple, iTunes 12.7.1 includes “minor app and performance improvements.”
* As we explained, the app is now about music, movies, TV shows, podcasts and audiobooks.
* The ability to browse App Store in iTunes for Mac and Windows, as well as sync apps with iOS devices and buy ringtones, is no longer part of the media software. For more information on all the changes in the new iTunes, see Apple’s support document.
* TUTORIAL: How to re-download your previously purchased ringtones on iPhone
* If you want to browse and download iOS apps from App Store, download iTunes 12.6.3 instead.
* iTunes 12.6.3 comes with the built-in App Store and ringtones sections so you can download and sync your iOS apps and ringtones using your computer. Plus, the app won’t prompt you to download new iTunes versions as they become available.
* For those wondering, iTunes 12.6.3 is optimized for iOS 11 and supports syncing with the latest iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X devices. Apple said it provided this version because “certain business partners might still need to use iTunes to install apps.”
