* Google Drive — the Cloud storage solution much in the same vein as Dropbox — will be making its way to iOS today. It joins Google’s Chrome browser as the second Google developed offering to hit the rival iOS platform.
* Back in April we covered the official launch of Google Drive, but at the time, the service lacked an iOS app.
* All of that should change by the end of the day today, as Google Drive is slated to release some time today.
* Google Drive accounts receive 5 GBs of free cloud storage, with in-app options to purchase more as needed. Considering the service/app is in its infancy, I’m not sure if it will be compelling enough to even consider switching from DropBox at this point.
* What do you think?
* Update: Google Drive is now available for free download.
