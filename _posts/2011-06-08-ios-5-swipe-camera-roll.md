* Yet another new feature that made it to iOS 5. When using the camera app, you can swipe to the right to bring your camera roll. From there, you can flick left and right to go to previous pictures or go back to your camera app.
* At any time, you can tap anywhere on the screen to bring some of the picture controls and tap “done” to return to your camera app…
* This is perfect for shooting pictures and quickly checking whether they’re good or not.
* Do you like it?
