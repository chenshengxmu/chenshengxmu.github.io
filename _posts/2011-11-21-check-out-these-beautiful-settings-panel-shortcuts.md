* Ever since our initial post that showed how to create shortcuts for some of the most used items in the Settings app, many have taken a lot of interest in the idea.
* Considering that there is no jailbreak for the iPhone 4S, and no untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 in general, many are using Settings panel shortcuts as they wait for a jailbreak solution that works for them.
* In the meantime, UI designer Jeff Broderick has taken things into his own hands, creating the most beautiful and detailed shortcuts icons we’ve seen to date…
* If you head over to http://brdrck.me/settings on your iDevice, you can download the shortcut icons for yourself. There’s only a handful of shortcuts available, but Broderick set out to capture some of the most useful ones like Wi-Fi, Brightness, Bluetooth, Hotspot, etc.
* This is a great alternative to the IconProject method that we initially told you about, but if you want a list of all of the possible toggles, you’re going to want to check out our in-depth IconProject post.
* Obviously, if you’re on a jailbroken device, you want to check out SBSettings, because that allows you to directly toggle certain features on and off. This is more of a workaround for iPhone 4S users, since there’s currently no iPhone 4S jailbreak to speak of.
* What do you think about these newly designed shortcuts icons?
