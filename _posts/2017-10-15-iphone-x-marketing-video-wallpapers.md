* The best feature of iPhone X will be the Super Retina OLED Display. If you want a sneak peak, just go to your local Best Buy and checkout an LG OLED UHD TV and then imagine it being shrunk to 5.8″ and in your pocket. It will be incredible.
* Now, imagine that fancy new display, with a bunch of vibrant colors on your Lock and Home screens. Apple is thinking the same thing and their marketing videos prove it. Since the iPhone X announcement video, you have been contacting me to see when we would get a version for download. Look no further.
* Apple announced the iPhone X with the marketing video seen above. A swirling mess of glitter and color fill up every little curved corner of the iPhone X, and it looks mouth watering. The video is actually a collaboration with WeAreColorful. The group is a collaboration between Oilhack and Thomas Blanchard. The artist painters combined to inspire moving artistic creations through innovative new techniques. Below is the video that inspired the iPhone X commercial.
* The wallpapers, yes. Below, are wallpapers created from screenshots of the WeAreColorful video. The ratio is fairly narrow, which means optimized for iPhone X. However, these will work on any iPhone, so long as you zoom a bit, when setting the image as your wallpaper.
* These wallpapers were created by @jérémygoulet. Goulet is a UI/UX designer and frontend dev. You can find more of his creativity on his personal website.
* He contacted me via @jim_gresham, where I interact with Wallpapers of the Week fans and take submissions for our weekly post! Catch up with me or follow along for mid-week downloads and previews of the coming weeks’ posts!
* Thanks to some iDB readers for reaching out to me via Twitter. It came to my attention the initial zip file issued to me, did not include the blue alternative images found in the preview image. Immediately below, you will find the three additional alternate images.
