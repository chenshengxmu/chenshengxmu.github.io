* Apple on Monday issued a bug-fix update to iTunes for Mac and Windows. iTunes 12.2.1, available through the Software Update mechanism or standalone via iTunes.com/download, fixes a pair of issues with iTunes Match, Apple’s $25 per year song identification service. In addition, it contains minor bug fixes and improvements for Beats 1, Apple’s free of charge 24/7 global Internet radio broadcasting in more than a hundred countries.
* Apple claims that iTunes 12.2.1 resolves Beats 1 radio streaming issues that some users have complained about, including Beats 1 not responding, refuse to stream or dropping a live stream unexpectedly.
* The 226-megabyte update includes the following changes:
* As mentioned before, you can download the iTunes installer for Mac or Windows straight from Apple.
* Mac users can choose App Store in the Mac menu and find iTunes 12.2.1 under the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. On Windows, open the Apple Software Update application to check for updates.
* Alternatively, you can fire up iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC and select the Check for Updates option in the iTunes (Mac) or Help (Windows) menu.
