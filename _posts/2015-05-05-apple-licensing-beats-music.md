* Apple is really cutting it close if it wants to relaunch Beats Music at its developer conference next month. Citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, Billboard reports that it is still missing a number of key licensing deals it would need to secure to unveil a new streaming music service.
* “A June launch is still attainable,” one source tells Billboard. “If any company can do it, they can.” However, another source at a major record label tells the publication that there is no way Apple will be able to pull off a June launch for the new service, saying simply that “the deals aren’t done.”
* WWDC will take place from June 8-12 this year, and while most of the conference is geared toward developers, Apple often uses the stage to introduce new products and services. Other announcements expected this year include a new, slimmer Apple TV with a redesigned remote and App Store.
* Apple’s new music service will be built largely on the Beats Music service it acquired as part of its $3 billion acquisition last summer. It’s believed the company is betting big on Beats’ unique curation and discovery features to differentiate it from competitor services such as Spotify and Rdio.

* Update: 9to5Mac has commented on Billboard’s article, saying that Apple is still planning on previewing the new Beats Music service at WWDC.
