* According to a new report, Pegatron has received orders from the Cupertino company to start production on the iPhone 6. Taiwan’s Industrial and Commercial Times says that the supplier has been tasked with producing around 15% of all units of the upcoming 4.7-inch handset.
* The news matches up with previous chatter, which claimed that Apple would be splitting up iPhone 6 orders between Foxconn and Pegatron. It was initially believed, however, that the split would be somewhere around 50-50, so it’s unclear what—if anything—has changed…
* Here’s the report from ICT, shared by Macotakara (via MacRumors):
* Apple’s supply chain rumors, Apple will deliver a 4.7-inch iPhone in the third quarter, the market is also optimistic about the size of enlarged iPhone, expected to create a new wave of buying boom, and the master also won about 15% of new iPhone orders, is expected to begin in September of goods, coupled with the old iPhone 4S, iPhone 5C, estimated this year’s iPhone Pegatron point total shipments of 50 million units, compared to 3,500 million units last year, a significant growth of 40%.
* In an effort to diversify its supply chain, Apple has slowly enhanced its relationship with Pegatron over the years. In 2013, it put the manufacturer in charge of producing the iPhone 5c, and it has also moved over the production of the iPad mini and other products to the company.

* It’s interesting that the report specifically says the ‘4.7-inch iPhone.’ Rumors have been circling for months that Apple is working on two next-gen handsets, one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch, and recent reports say that the latter will be significantly delayed.
* If the information we’ve seen so far holds true, both models will feature a new design with a much thinner profile, elongated volume buttons, and rounded corners. The smartphones are also expected to receive notable performance bumps, and launch sometime in September.
