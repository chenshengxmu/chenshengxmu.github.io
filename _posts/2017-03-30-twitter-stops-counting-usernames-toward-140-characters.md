* Twitter announced Thursday that it’s no longer counting user names in tweets, such as @idownloadblog, toward its 140-character limit. With this change, any user names for mentions and replies will no longer shorten the amount of characters you could include in a tweet.
* Last year, the micro-blogging service began allowing users to attach photos, animated GIFs, videos, polls, quoted tweets and direct messages to tweets without the links counting against the 140-character limit.
* “When reading a conversation, you’ll actually see what people are saying, rather than seeing lots of @usernames at the start of a tweet,” wrote the company.
* As you can see on the header image, Twitter now displays the usernames attached to a tweet you’re replying to at the top of the interface rather than within the tweet itself so you have more characters to have conversations. Tapping the Replying to… heading lets you adjust which users are included in your reply.
* This feature requires an updated version of Twitter for iOS, which will begin rolling out later today. This update is also rolling out now on twitter.com as well as on Twitter for Android.
* Download Twitter for iOS free of charge via App Store.
