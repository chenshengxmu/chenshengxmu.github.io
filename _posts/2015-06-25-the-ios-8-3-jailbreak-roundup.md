* It’s been a crazy last couple of days, but it’s also been very exciting. It all started when the jailbreak for iOS 8.3 came unexpectedly on Tuesday morning, and it culminates with the release of a Cydia Substrate compatible update this evening. No doubt, there’s still much more to come, but now we’d like to take the time to wrap up the ongoings of the last two days.
* In this post, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about the iOS 8.3 jailbreak, and what you might expect in the future.
