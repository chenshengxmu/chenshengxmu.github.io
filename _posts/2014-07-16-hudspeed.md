* One of my personal iOS pet peeves is how long it takes for the volume HUD to fade away after adjusting the volume. It seems to linger there for an absurd amount of time, wearing out its welcome in the process.
* A new jailbreak tweak called HUDSpeed has been released to combat the extended presence of the overlay. HUDSpeed is a tweak that takes a logical approach to fixing this issue—it speeds up the HUD animation forcing it to disappear quicker.
* Does it work? Have a look at our video walkthrough past the break for the answer.
* After installing HUDSpeed, venture to its preference panel in the stock Settings app to adjust the animation duration. Inside of the preferences you’ll see a toggle to enable the tweak (it’s enabled on install) and a slider knob to adjust the animation speed (duration).
* The lower the speed, the faster the animation fades out. You can set the speed all the way down to zero for an absurdly quick volume HUD animation. Conversely, you can bump the speed up to 3 for a turtle-like volume HUD that seems to want to linger around forever.

* HUDSpeed works just as advertised. If you’re tired of the volume HUD loitering on your iPhone’s screen, then get this tweak and put a stop to the nonsense. It’s a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and comes from a very reputable developer (CameraTweak and HandsFree). Get it, and let me know what you think about it down below in the comments.
