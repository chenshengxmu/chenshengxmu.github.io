* If you’re a big fan of music, you might be interested in taking a look at a list of top jailbreak tweaks that will spice up your stock Music app and allow you to customize it. Although the Music app in iOS 7 has a sleek design and offers most of the features a user might want, there are many tweaks available in Cydia that give you more control over this stock app and enhance your music listening experience. This is why we have compiled a list of the best jailbreak tweaks that will boost your Music app…

* Developed by MPow and designed by Surenix, MiniPlayer is a tweak that ports the iTunes 11 mini player to iOS 7 and allows you to control music from anywhere within iOS. The tweak adds a small widget which hovers over your Lock screen, Home screen or any app that is open and displays the information about a currently playing song, provides playback controls such as play/pause, next and previous, displays the album artwork and provides a scrubbing ability to move to a specific portion of the currently playing track.
* The most interesting feature of MiniPlayer is the ability to search for a song and add it to the queue to be played next. It also allows users to arrange the songs in the queue by making use of the drag handles. You can move the music widget around on your screen and hide it by swiping it to the left or right side of the screen. If you don’t want it to hover on your screen, you can assign an activator action to show or hide it.
* MiniPlayer is available in Cydia for $1.99 and works on all iOS 5, 6 and 7 devices.

* Next in the list is Musiex, a tweak that is somewhat similar to MiniPlayer but instead, it appears at the top of your screen just like the iOS notification banner. Compared to MiniPlayer, Musiex lacks the ability to queue songs to be played next but allows users to play/pause a currently playing track, move to the next or previous song, scrub songs and provides shuffle and repeat options as well.
* The tweak can be accessed from the Lock screen, Home screen, or within an app by making use of an activator gesture to show it. Swiping it up or pressing the Home button will hide the tweak. It also supports many third party music apps from the App Store.
* One favorable feature of Musiex is the ability to customize the tweak’s interface including the background color, opacity as well as the text color. It gives you a complete control over how the tweak looks.
* Musiex is available for $0.99 via Cydia’s BigBoss repository and is compatible with all iOS 7 devices excluding iPad.

* One of the most popular music tweak available on Cydia, Aria brings the stock iOS 7 Music app to life and provides users with the most wanted features. The notable change that Aria brings is the grid view which displays albums and artists as grids instead of a list. Additionally, the tweak provides the following features:
* Aria is compatible with iOS 7 devices and is available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $1.99.

* If you are bored of the stock Music app’s look, you may want to try out Colorize. The tweak colorizes the “Now Playing” interface of the Music app based on the song’s artwork. It brings a pretty nice look to the Music app and the color really matches the song’s artwork.
* Colorize is available in Cydia for $0.99 and is compatible with iOS 7 devices.

* Pluck 2 is definitely a useful tweak that comes in handy in many situations especially when you’re driving a car. The tweak allows users to pick a song directly from the Lock screen or Control Center without having to unlock the device to choose a song. It adds a small icon beside the media controls in Control Center and tapping on it will open up your music library. Additionally, an icon is also added to the bottom left corner of the Lock screen and holding on it for a short period of time will display your music library.
* Pluck 2 is worth a try and is available via Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $0.99.

* A free and useful tweak that automatically fetches the lyrics of a currently playing song and displays it to you in the “Now Playing” interface. This saves you the time of having to add them through iTunes. I tested the tweak with several tracks and found out that it displayed the lyrics of about 60% of the songs I selected.
* Lyricalizer can be download for free via Cydia and it supports iOS 5, 6 and 7 devices.

* If you want a Music app with gesture based controls, you may want to try out MusicGestures. It supports iOS 4 – iOS 7 devices and is available for free in Cydia.

* If you’re looking for a way to customize the sound of an audio track, you might want to try out EqualizerEverywhere. The tweak adds equalizer settings to Control Center, which can be accessed by swiping the audio controls from right to left. Swiping once more will provide you access to a list of equalizer presets. Users can also create their own custom EQ preset and save it for future use.
* The tweak not only works with the stock Music app, but with other media apps as well. EqualizerEverywhere is available in Cydia for $3 and supports iOS 7 devices.
