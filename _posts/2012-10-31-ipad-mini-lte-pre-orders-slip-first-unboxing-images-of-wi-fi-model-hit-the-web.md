* Apple originally promised to ship the 4G LTE cellular version of the iPad mini mid-November. However, following selling out of initial supplies of Wi-Fi models, analysts have warned the company could easily face production issues that could easily affect delivery dates. Multiple web reports now indicate that Apple is in fact removing delivery dates for iPad mini LTE pre-orders.
* Some customers are now reporting that the company updated their November 23 shipment date to just “mid-November”. Meanwhile, just as first (and largely positive) reviews hit the web, a guy in France has already received his Wi-Fi unit ahead of Friday’s official launch and posted a series of unboxing pics…
* Apple removing the shipping date from early iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular orders was first reported by Jordan Kahn of 9to5Mac.

* French site iGen (via MacRumors) posted these unboxing images from a customer who pre-ordered a white iPad mini from French reseller Darty. Click on any of the above snaps for an ultra-high resolution version, these really look gorgeous on Retina devices.

* Apple’s gonna sell a truckload of these if it can churn out enough units for the holidays.

* You know you want one.
* Wi-Fi iPad mini and the fourth-generation iPad with Retina display land on store shelves in the United States, Canada and an additional 32 countries this Friday, November 2. If you’re gonna pick one up at your local Apple store, know that sales begin at 8:00am.
* iDB will be posting its own unboxing video and review the iPad mini as soon as our unit arrives.
* Stay tuned!
* What do you think of these snaps?
* The smaller iPad is even sexier than on Apple’s press shots, doesn’t it?
