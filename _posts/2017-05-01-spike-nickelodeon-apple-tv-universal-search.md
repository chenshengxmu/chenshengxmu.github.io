* Apple has added a few new content providers to tvOS’s universal search feature, like Spike and the Nickelodeon channel, including Nick Jr. The feature currently works with a bunch of popular video apps in the United States and select international markets, allowing Apple TV owners to search for movies and TV shows using Siri across all supported apps.
* Including today’s additions of Spike, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr, the following third-party content providers are currently supported by tvOS’s universal search on the fourth-generation Apple TV:
* YouTube search is supported across all regions. To search for YouTube content, simply use Siri and include the word “YouTube” in your search (i.e. “Search UFO sightings on YouTube”).
* Last December, universal search rolled out support for music videos and documentaries on Apple Music. Before that, Apple AMC and The Hallmark Channel were added to the list of apps which work with tvOS’s universal search.
* Last fall, Apple added Australian streaming service Stan, popular Spanish network Telemundo Now, The CW, Viacom-owned Comedy Central and music networks MTV and VH1 to the list of universal search providers on Apple TV.
* The full list of providers for tvOS’s universal search function is on Apple’s website.
