* T-Mobile has kicked off a press event in Seattle, Washington tonight that it is calling ‘Uncarrier 5.0.’ The provider has used similar uncarrier events in the past to announce industry-changing initiatives like ‘Jump’ and ‘No ETF fees,’ so that should tell you what we could see tonight.
* John Legere has been on stage for a few minutes now, and has already made a number of announcements. Perhaps the biggest one we’ve heard thus far is a new program called ‘Test Drive,’ which will allow customers to borrow an iPhone 5s free for a week to test out T-Mobile’s network…
* Starting on June 23rd, T-Mobile will lend you a top-of-the-line iPhone 5s for free, for a whole 7 days. The program is aimed at customers who are currently on the fence about switching from a larger carrier—such as Verizon or AT&T—to T-Mobile and are concerned about its network.
* If you’re interested, you can sign up starting next week here, and you’ll receive your iPhone 5s a few days later equipped with a week-long trial of unlimited everything. It’s worth noting, though, that a $750 hold will be placed on your credit card, and you’ll be charged $100 for any damage.

* Unfortunately, if you like the service and choose to sign up, you won’t get to keep your Test Drive iPhone. You’ll have to return it to your local T-Mobile store, where it will be refurbished back into the program, and you’ll have to either provide your own handset or buy a new one from the carrier.
* I have to say this is an interesting move, which could certainly help sway folks who are on the fence about switching to T-Mobile. The carrier already offers cheaper rate plans than its larger competitors, so if it can prove its network is up to par, I can’t imagine why users wouldn’t make the switch.
* What do you think?
