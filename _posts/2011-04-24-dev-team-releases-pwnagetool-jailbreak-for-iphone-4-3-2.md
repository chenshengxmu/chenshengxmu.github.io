* Sunday is “funday,” so the iPhone Dev Team has just released an update to their PwnageTool jailbreak tool for Mac OSX users. PwnageTool 4.3.2 incorporates i0n1c’s updated iOS 4.3.2 untethered exploit. The previous version of PwnageTool was only capable of a tethered jailbreak.
* PwnageTool 4.3.2 will allow you to safely restore to an already jailbroken iOS 4.3.2 firmware and preserve your current 1.59.00 baseband so that you can use UltraSn0w to unlock your iPhone… 
* PwnageTool for iOS 4.3.2 supports the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad 1, iPod Touch 3G and iPod Touch 4G. This will not work for the iPad 2 as it has an updated bootROM. If you are a Windows user, you can preserve your baseband using Sn0wbreeze 2.6 or TinyUmbrella (iPhone 4 only).
* You can download PwnageTool 4.3.2 from our download section.
* Check out our full tutorial on how to jailbreak iOS 4.3.2 with PwnageTool!
