* Despite the fact that investors have begun to worry about Apple’s future, the company is still one of the wealthiest in the world. The iPad-maker added another $13 billion to its cash pile last quarter, bringing the total to $137 billion.
* And that number will only continue to grow, because Apple doesn’t really spend much money. Maybe a few billion on research and development, and another couple on data centers and other facilities. But not enough to make a dent…
* The following infographic comes from the folks over at Master-business-administration.org, and it shows where Apple spends most of its money.

* I find it interesting that Apple spends so much less than other big companies on things like advertising and D.C. lobbying. For example, it only spends $500,000 on lobbying expenses and Google spends $5 million. But then again, it is Google.
* Also, if you needed any more proof that Apple is betting big on iCloud and other web services, just look at what it spends on data centers. It’s no coincidence that the $7.04 billion tab was one of the company’s largest expenses last year.
* Overall, pretty interesting stuff, wouldn’t you say?
