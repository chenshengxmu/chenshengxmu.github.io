* Camera+ by Taptaptap, the award-winning iPhone photography app and one of the longest-standing camera and image editing apps in the App Store, is available free of charge for a limited time, but only through Apple’s sleek Apple Store shopping application for the iPhone and iPad. That’s a cool $2.99 saving right off the bat over the app’s regular asking price.
* No matter if you’re only mildly into mobile photography or a seasoned photographer, you really shouldn’t miss out on this promotion because Camera+ has never gone free since its inception in August of 2011. Again, you can’t just follow the app’s iTunes URL to grab Camera+ for zero bucks because the offer is exclusive to users who have the Apple Store application installed on their devices.
* Jump past the fold for the full instructions.
* Step 1: Download the universal Apple Store application for the iPhone and iPad, it’s free in the App Store.
* Step 2: Open the Apple Store app on your iPhone or iPad and hit the Store tab along the bottom. Scroll halfway down to the Camera+ promotion and tap the link. A new screen will appear with app description. Now tap the green “Download now for free” button at the bottom.

* Step 3: You’ll be now taken to the App Store. Upon confirming your Apple ID password, the App Store will put up the Camera+ promo page. Tap the Redeem button in the upper right. If all goes well, your copy of Camera+ will begin downloading to your device.

* Tip: Once the system has registered your free purchase, you’ll be able to re-download the app later and put it on your other devices through the Purchased tab in the App Store.
* Caveat: the offer is valid only in the U.S. App Store and the code is not redeemable for any purchase made within the app.
* Again, this limited-time offer expires on November 16, 2014 so you better hurry up and grab Camera+ for free before it’s too late. Note that only the iPhone/iPod touch edition of Camera+ is being offered for free. The legacy $4.99 Camera+ for iPad is still alive in the App Store as the team continues work on the all-new iPad build for iOS 8.
* In my view, Camera+ is the ultimate iPhone photography. The software is jam-packed with incredible features that would take too much space to mention here. Camera+ received a substantial iOS 8 refresh last month so I urge you to read my article to learn more about it.
* Just a brief recap: you get a new wheel control, handy white balance presets, a great macro shooting mode, the full range of manual camera controls such as ISO and exposure, a nice extension so you can edit images using Camera+ filters right inside the stock Photos app and much more.
* The app sold more than ten million copies and has a rating of four stars from more than 30,000 ratings in the App Store. I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy Camera+ as much as I’ve been.
* For what it’s worth, this app has to this date remained my go-to software for quick touch ups, precise camera control and powerful image edits, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.
* Are you a Camera+ user and if not, will you be giving it a whirl?
