* If you’re a fan of Yahoo’s gorgeously designed iOS apps and spend a lot of time using their Mail service on your iPhone and iPad, you’re going to love the newly released Yahoo Mail 3.0, available free in the App Store.
* And why’s that, you ask? Because the refreshed software now makes it easy to keep tabs on your news and search the web while sorting through your email, without ever leaving the app.
* But that’s not all, this release of Yahoo Mail includes other goodies, too, listed right after the break…
* In addition to news and search, Yahoo Mail 3.0 now features snapshots of your weather, sports scores, stocks and latest News Digest items.
* These features are available only on iPhones running iOS 7.0 or later and take advantage of the Background App Refresh feature to deliver new content in the background, even when the app itself isn’t running.
* As for News Digest, it debuted back in January as Yahoo’s beautifully designed iPhone app that combines human curation and computer algorithms powered by Summly to bring you the most important news twice a day.
* As the name suggests, News Digest combines various media types and information from a myriad of sources and presents you with quick summaries so it’s a good way to catch up on the latest news as you’re sipping your morning coffee.
* This edition of Yahoo Mail also comes with – you guessed right – various performance improvements and bug fixes.
* Download Yahoo Mail 3.0 free in the App Store.
* The app is universal and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
* In other Yahoo news, the company just announced on its investor website that it will stream a live concert every day for a year, thanks to its partnership with Live Nation, the concert ticketing company.
* Plus, they’re promising to release two new comedy series next year in hopes of becoming an even more serious player in Internet video programming.
