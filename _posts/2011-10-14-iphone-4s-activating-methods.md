* With over a million iPhone 4S units pre-ordered and countless more sold through retail stores today, it’s no wonder that carriers’ activation systems are crippled. If you’ve been having problems activating your new iPhone, you’re not alone.
* We’ve actually been having quite a few issues ourselves today, and have been searching for workarounds to get our new handsets active. After a lot of digging, I’ve come up with two pretty good alternatives to the typical activation methods…
* The first method I came across is courtesy of Arnold Kim of MacRumors. He suggested trying to visit my carrier’s online activation page, and so I did. While this worked for several people, it kept redirecting me back to iTunes for further assistance.
* Of course iTunes didn’t work, so I finally broke down and decided to call into my carrier’s (AT&T) customer service. Surprisingly, I was only on hold for a couple of minutes. And when the representative picked up, she was more than happy to help me.
* After verifying my name and the last four digits of my social security number, we went to work. All I had to do was read her my phone’s IMEI and ICCID numbers (found on the back of the iPhone’s box in the barcodes), and within moments, I was activated.
* Now these methods may not work for everyone. There’s several variables involved when dealing with cell phones, and the fix isn’t always a simple one. But if you’re having problems activating your iPhone today, these methods are definitely worth a shot.
* Did either of these work for you?
