* This ultra slim case is one of the thinnest on the market at only 0.35mm. It is made of polypropylene, which is a soft, durable plastic material. The side comes right up to curved edge of the screen, but not over. So, you don’t get any screen protection, but it also barely looks like you have a case on it at all. The Scarf is available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on Amazon for $10.

* Similar to the Scarf, this simple case measures in at a slim 0.5mm and is made from flexible polycarbonate. The outside is coated with a special soft texture material that helps with gripping. This case is designed with screen protection in mind. Although not much, it reaches out past the top edge of the iPhone to give you some protection from flat surface drops on the screen. It is available on Amazon for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for $9 and $11 respectively.

* For the clearest solution to having a case, but not having a case, check out the Halo Hybrid by iBlason. This case has a strong scratch-resistant shell that snaps onto the backside of your iPhone. The volume and power controls are covered to protect from dust and debris. The case is surrounded by a soft, rubberized bumper to protect from accidental drops. It extends above the lip of the screen to help keep your display safe from scratches on flat surfaces. It is available on Amazon for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for between $10 and $14.

* If you are looking for a mix between minimalism and protection, the Fusion is a nice balance. It is simple, but features a lot of rugged features you wouldn’t normally find on a minimalist case. For example, the Lightning and headphone ports are covered with dust caps to keep out unwanted debris. It also has added shock-absorbing protection on the corners, extended button covers, and a scratch-resistant coating. The lip extends over the screen to protect against scratches when you lay your device facedown on a flat surface. It is available on Amazon for between $10 and $17 for the iPhone 6 and $12 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

* Apple is to tech design what John Pawson is to architecture. Simple is not enough. It also has to be stylish and classy. It makes sense that the company would make a case that looks good without calling too much attention. It meets all of the requirements for minimal protection, the buttons are covered and it has a raised lip, while still looking like the inside of a Mercedes Benz. The case comes in a variety of colors and is available from Apple for $45 for the iPhone 6 or $49 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

* If you are looking for some protection, but still want to feel like you are not using a case at all, the best option is to not use a case at all. Bumpies are corner guards that protect your iPhone against drops and nothing else. If it lands on a corner, or on the front or backside, you can be confident that the impact resistant caps will keep it safe. Of course, dust and scratches might plague your device, but at least you will be less likely to be walking around with a cracked screen. Bumpies come in a four-pack for $25 for both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
