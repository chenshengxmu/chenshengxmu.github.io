* You might have heard Samsung is spending big bucks to have a TV commercial air during the next Super Bowl. They’re so excited that they can’t help bragging about it all over the web, just like a high school girl who just scored a prom date with the star quarterback.
* Trying to generate buzz prior to the big day, Samsung released a teaser that, as usual, makes fun of Apple fanboys for standing in line to get the new iPhone. Of course, Samsung wouldn’t have such a problem since no one actually ever had to get in line to buy a Samsung phone. That’s how popular they are…
* Yawn for boring and unoriginal marketing.
