* Unless you’ve been living under a rock the past few months, you’ve no doubt caught wind of BBSettings, the so-called “SBSettings killer” for iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* True enough, it is a very beautiful widget, and its function is certainly promising, but can it take down the reigning king of all jailbreak apps?
* Find out the answer to that question and more, as I go hands-on with BBSettings on video…
* The short answer to that question is, no; it’s not an SBSettings killer; not yet.
* I found the BBSettings to be a bit too laggy in its current form, but it certainly shows promise.
* Right now, SBSettings is far and away more useful, due to features like Mobile Substrate add-ons, the ability to quickly hide app icons, and the simple theming properties.
* That’s not to say that BBSettings can’t be an SBSettings killer; it just isn’t in its current form.
* What do you think? If you want to give BBSettings a shot for yourself, and your iPhone is jailbroken, you can download it from its GitHub repository and install it via iFile.
