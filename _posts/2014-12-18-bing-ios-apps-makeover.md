* Microsoft’s mobile Bing apps for the iPhone and iPad are getting a major makeover today, with the translate extension that debuted in the iPhone app two months ago at last available on iPads.
* On the iPhone, you can now tap anywhere underneath the search box to check out Bing’s image of the day in uncluttered full-screen view. You can also swipe from the left to see yesterday’s image of the day.
* Another handy addition: weather information, trending news and images of the day zoom to full screen smoothly when swiping from the bottom of Bing’s Home screen.
* I’m liking Bing’s new look on the iPhone.
* The Home screen has been thoroughly revamped and the search box has been moved to the middle of the screen and made larger, which looks great on the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus canvas.
* Bing’s translate extensions is now available via the Share sheet in Safari for iPad. Just tap the Share button and choose More at right to enable the extensions. You’ll be then able to instantly translate web pages in either the Bing app or the Safari browser to a desired language.
* Check out the reworked iPad UI.

* In addition, Bing for iPad has gained a new Today view. After enabling the Bing widget in the Notification Center on your iPad, it will serve up the Bing image of the day and trending stories for that day, as shown below.
