* The nation’s second-largest carrier, AT&T, on Wednesday upgraded its cell phone trade-in program at its brick-and-mortar retail stores. The new terms incentivize customers to trade-in their old smartphone for one of the latest models and receive a $100 credit on-the-spot, which can be immediately redeemed against any AT&T smartphone or accessory purchase.
* If you have an old iPhone or an Android phone that is less than three years old, the $100 trade-in credit lets you purchase a brand new iPhone 5 for just $99. Or, you could settle with an iPhone 4S wit zero bucks in upfront payment. By comparison, the entry-level 16GB iPhone 4S/5 normally sets you back $99/$199 after a two-year contract…
* From AT&T’s news release:
* Beginning May 1, consumers who trade in their current smartphone to AT&T* will be eligible to receive at least $100 off the purchase of a new smartphone, including the new Samsung Galaxy S4, BlackBerry Z10 or 32 GB HTC One.
* These devices are normally $199.99 with a qualifying two-year agreement but, with this limited time promotion, they will be available for $99.99.
* Although iPhone isn’t specifically mentioned, AT&T confirmed that the promotion applies to “any smartphone” it sells. In addition to being no more than three years old, the carrier is expecting your old device to be in “good, working condition.”

* The pricier (and newer) your phone, the larger the credit.
* “Some trade-in phones may have a value higher than $100,” AT&T explains. “In this case, customers will receive the credit at the higher value.”
* The $100 trade-in credit promotion won’t last forever, but AT&T didn’t specify when it will end. If you have an old device that you’d like to get rid of (and who doesn’t), better take advantage of this promotion before AT&T changes its mind.
* Under the updated terms of the AT&T trade-in program, you will be required to put your name on the dotted line and sign up for a minimum monthly voice and data or Mobile Share plan.
* Your trade-in credit will be issued instantly via AT&T Promotion Card in AT&T’s retail stores or via mail through att.com.
* Participating authorized dealers will provide instant in-store credit or their own promotion card. Also important: credit from authorized dealers may be applied to the purchase of AT&T devices and accessories, but may not be applied to charges for AT&T services.
