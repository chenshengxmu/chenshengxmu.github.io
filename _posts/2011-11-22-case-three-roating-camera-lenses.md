* Not only does Apple make a fortune from its iPhones, iPads, and anything else with a lower-case “i,” but it also spawned thousands of awesome accessories. The iPhone especially has seen some interesting accessories come its way, and “interesting” is probably the best way to describe this particular case.
* Weighing in at $250 and sporting three rotatable lenses, the Lens Dial is perhaps more than a normal case, but it is also one of the more whacky.
* The Lens Dial, carved from aircraft-grade aluminum, packs the three lenses shown in the picture, allowing photographic types to take all kinds of images using the iPhone’s built-in shooter…
* The case also features two tripod mounts (one for each orientation) and a three lens kit consisting a 0.7x wide-angle, a 0.33x fisheye, and a 1.5x telephoto lens.
* “The iPhone Lens Dial boasts three optical-quality coated glass lenses: Wide Angle, Fisheye, and Telephoto. All wrapped up in a slim aircraft-grade aluminum jacket equipped with two tripod mounts (for portrait or landscape shots).”
* All three lenses stay attached to the device, meaning you’re never going to lose them and more importantly, they’re always handy should the photobug bite you whilst out and about.

* The Lens Dial is designed for the iPhone 4 and 4S, and given the impressive cameras built into Apple’s two newest smartphones, it is easy to see why.
* Combing both the awesome and bizarre, the $250 Lens Dial can be ordered right now.
