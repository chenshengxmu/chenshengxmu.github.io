* Nearly 6 months after announcing that it would be coming in ‘a few weeks,’ Google has finally launched an official Google Play Music app for iPhone. The software allows you to use both Google’s All Access and standard music services.
* All Access is similar to Spotify and other like-services, allowing users to listen to unlimited songs and create custom radio stations. And the standard service lets you upload 20,000 of your own songs to the cloud for playback anywhere…
* From the App Store description:
* All Access features: – Listen to unlimited songs – Create custom radio stations from any song, artist or album – Enjoy radio without skip limits – Get smart recommendations based on your tastes – Enjoy handcrafted playlists from our music experts
* All Access and standard features: – Add up to 20,000 of your own songs from your personal music collection using your Mac, Windows or Linux computer – Listen on all your devices and our web player at play.google.com/music – Access your music anywhere without syncing, and save your favorites for offline playback – Experience all your music without ads
* You’ll obviously need a Google Play Music account to use the app. The good news is, the standard service is completely free, and Google is currently offering a 30-day free trial of its All Access service. Afterwards it’ll cost you $9.99 per month.

* I haven’t played with All Access enough yet to know if it’s much better or worse than other services, but with a free app and free 30-day trial, I’d say it’s worth checking out. You can find the new Google Play Music app in the App Store for free.
