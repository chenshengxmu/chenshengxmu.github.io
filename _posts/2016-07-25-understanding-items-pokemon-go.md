* As you play Pokémon GO, you’re going to find yourself collecting a ton of items from PokéStops and from simply leveling up your character as you progress through the game.
* In this piece, we’ll talk about all the items you can obtain in Pokémon GO, and what they’re used for.
* Items are basically things that you collect to make things happen. Sure, you collect Pokémon, but these aren’t the only things you attempt to collect in the game. Items range from Pokéballs to potions to all sorts of other random stuff, and each item can help you or your Pokémon in your quest to catch ’em all.

* All of your items are accessed from the Pokémon GO map by tapping on the Pokéball button at the bottom center, then tapping on the Items button.
* This will be a comprehensive list of the items that are available to Pokémon GO players as of this writing. As future updates are expected, things are subject to change, so please bear with us.
* One of the types of items you’ll find in Pokémon GO are Pokéballs, and they’re one of the most important items you’re going to need in order to capture Pokémon that you run into. There are different types of Pokéballs, and as you level up, you will unlock them. Newer Pokéball types tend to have an improved chance of catching, so we’ll start getting into the details below:
* Another important item that you’ll come across in the Pokémon GO game are battling items, which are important if you’re going to be participating in gym battles. Battling items have healing properties that help your Pokémon last longer in a match against another Pokémon. Here are the details:
* You’re also provided with a number of other items in the Pokémon GO game, and each of them serves a different purpose. We’ll talk about them below:
* If you’re out and about and looking for Pokémon, you should stay close to PokéStops where you can constantly re-fuel your item supply. It’s a good idea to combine the use of PokéStop lures and incense together because it’ll help make the area a Pokémon-rich one.
* Moreover, you should use lucky eggs when you’re expecting yourself to be in an area with a lot of Pokémon, because you want to absorb as much XP as possible. We recommend using Pokémon eggs when you’re near lured Pokéstops and have Incense activated, that way you can really take full advantage of the double-XP and level yourself up faster to unlock new items and new max CP (combat power) for your Pokémon.
* You should also keep in mind that you’re looking for Pokémon to catch, and you come across a high-level and highly-evolved Pokémon that you don’t see every day, it will be difficult to catch. You can combine Razz Berries and stronger Pokéballs like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball together to increase your odds ever-so-much more than they would be with just a Pokéball alone. You can also continue to use more Razz Berries as you miss.
* Pokémon GO comes with a slew of items to use to catch your Pokémon and build your character, so it’s important to get to know them. By harnessing items to their fullest potential, you’ll reach higher levels faster and build your Pokémon database more efficiently.
* If you’re not already playing Pokémon GO, you can join the increasingly-growing crowd of players by downloading the game for free from the iOS App Store.
