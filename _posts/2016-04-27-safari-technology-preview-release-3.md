* Apple today launched a third update for Safari Technology Preview, an experimental version of the desktop Safari browser for developers to try and test out upcoming web technologies. Safari Technology Preview Release 3 includes a long list of bug fixes and tweaks for various web technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, Web APIs, Web Inspector, Accessibility, Rendering, Media and Networking.
* If you already have an older version of Safari Technology Preview, the latest version is available through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. If you want to take Safari Technology Preview for a spin, go ahead as the installer does not require a developer account to download.
* Safari Technology Preview can co-exist with the consumer edition of the Safari browser on your Mac and it uses iCloud so all your Safari latest favorites, bookmarks and Reading List are instantly available to you in Safari Technology Preview.
* Release notes for Safari Technology Preview Release 3 can be found on Apple’s website.
