* Beats Electronics posted a new video to its Twitter account this evening called ‘Apple and Beats.’ The ad appears to be a continuation of today’s celebration festivities, but oddly enough, no one in the spot actually gets to celebrate.
* The clip features Beats Pill mascots Mikey and Tina, and Apple’s sassy digital assistant Siri. Apparently Dr. Dre is throwing a party to mark the Beats deal being completed, but Siri won’t give up directions because it’s by “invitation-only.”
* UPDATE: The original tweet from Beats has been deleted and the video has been pulled.
* Here’s the clip via 9to5Mac:

* Admittedly it’s a strange ad, but there could be a few inside jokes here. For one, there’s Dr. Dre’s not-so-official video confirming the Beats deal. Then there’s Apple’s track record of secrecy. And we’ve all heard Siri say that before.
* Earlier today, Apple posted a message on its website “welcoming Beats to the family.” Apparently the $3 billion acquisition, which was first announced two months ago, was finalized today with the approval of United States regulators.
