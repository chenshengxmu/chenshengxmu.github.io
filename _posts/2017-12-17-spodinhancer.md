* If you happen to use Spotify for your music-streaming needs on your jailbroken iOS device, then you might take an interest in a new jailbreak tweak dubbed Spodinhancer by iOS developer Codey More.
* If it wasn’t already evident from the name, Spodinhancer delivers a bevy of both cosmetic and functional augmentations to the Spotify app.
* After installation, you’ll find a new preference pane in Settings where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Among the options included here are:
* As you may have discerned already, some of these options depend on previous versions of the Spotify app (8.4.18 and 8.4.22). The current version of Spotify for iOS is 8.4.28, and some of these features won’t work if you have the latest version of the app installed.
* Whenever you make changes to the settings, you could close and restart the Spotify app via the App Switcher to save your changes. The developer graciously includes a “Tap to close Spotify” button directly inside the tweak’s preference pane, which you could also use.
* If you’d like to augment your Spotify app with Spodinhancer, you’ll find it in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $0.99. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8-10 devices. Furthermore, you can download the Spotify Music app for free from the App Store if you’re not already using it.
* Do any of the features from Spodinhancer appeal to you? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.
