* Users on iOS 6, iOS 7, and Macs are having issues connecting FaceTime video calls on Thursday.
* Many complaints have rung across Twitter and Apple Support communities. Even some of our devices here at iDownloadBlog are unable to connect for unknown reasons. 
* Apple hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue on its Support website, but a discussion on Apple support forum has several users complaining of connectivity issues – predominantly on iOS 6 devices.
* Forum user DaymanJC writes:
* Yesterday all 3 of my Apple devices stopped communicating via FaceTime. Some family members were still able to use theirs, but my iPhone 4, iPad 2, and wife’s iPhone 4 (different user ID/Account) gets a “connection failed” message everytime we try. Definitely noticing a trend over the past two days on Apple forums.
* Apple services have issues connecting from time-to-time – and this seems to be the case. Interestingly, Sebastien and I were able to get through just fine on Thursday afternoon from our iPhone’s, but not on our iPad out in California. It could be server related, rather than software.
* What are you experiencing?
