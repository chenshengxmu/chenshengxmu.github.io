* Ladies and gents, we’re back with the 5th episode of my favorite question and answer session. You guys have been coming up with some awesome, and sometimes, downright hilarious questions for me to tackle, and it is greatly appreciated.
* In this week’s episode, I answer questions on Android, Rock App, how to troubleshooting jailbreak app issues, the iPhone 5, and so much more. You’re going to need an extra plate to hold all of this home cooking! Check inside for the full episode…
* As always guys, you know the drill. If I didn’t get to your question this go ’round, don’t give up, keep asking.
* I will do my best to answer as many questions as I can for next week’s episode.
* In the meantime, why not share your questions below, and tell me your thoughts on this week’s agenda?
