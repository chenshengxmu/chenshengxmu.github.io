* Most modern Apple mobile devices are Touch ID-enabled and rarely get any passcode button screen time at all; nevertheless, any time your Touch ID sensor decides not to work correctly, or when rebooting your device, you will be introduced to it from time to time.
* For those who see the passcode input screen more than others, a new free jailbreak tweak called PassButtonStyle by developer CydiaGeek will let you customize the appearance of your passcode buttons.
* After installing PassButtonStyle, you’re going to find a preferences pane in the Settings app where you will be able to choose the style you want for your passcode button interface:

* There are eight styles in total to choose from, including the following:
* After you select your choice, you can tap on the respring button at the bottom of the preferences pane and this will save your changes.
* Aesthetic customization tweaks like this one aren’t necessarily everybody’s cup of tea, but there are a fair number of people out there who like to toy around with their device’s appearance and for the strong theme-based community that jailbreak their devices for the sole purpose of aesthetic customization, a tweak like this can help to complete the look they’re going for.
* If you’re interested in trying PassButtonStyle out, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak is intended to work on all jailbroken devices running iOS 8 through iOS 10.
