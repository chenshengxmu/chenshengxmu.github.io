* A leaked version of the iOS 11 GM appears to have made its way to the folks at 9to5Mac. It has revealed a few previously unknown details like a bevy of new wallpapers. It also seems to have revealed the new LTE Apple Watch including a new watch face and Digital Crown.
* It has been rumored for some time that a version of the Series 3 Apple Watch would include LTE, requiring no accompanying iPhone to receive data. What was still unknown, was whether the Series 3 model would receive a redesigned body to go along with it. Based on the leaked images inside of the iPhone’s Watch app, the only external changes will be a new colored accent to the Digital Crown.
* Of course, we still don’t know the extent of these changes. For instance, what colors the Digital Crown will come in, or if it would be limited to the red. That seems unlikely, however.

* It’s is also worth nothing how the signal strength in the center uses the dots that were used before iOS 11. This seems like an odd design choice when they just banished the dots from the iPhone to make room for the new cutout section of the iPhone 8.
* We also see new complications for the phone and maps which also are seemingly indicators of LTE support.

* There is also a screenshot of the Apple Watch Control Center that shows off the signal strength in the top left corner, as well as a cellular icon to toggle on/off.
* While LTE will no doubt be a flagship feature of the new Apple Watch, it would be surprising if that was the only new addition. Looks like we have to wait until Tuesday to see for sure what the Series 3 will have in store for us.
* According to additional features uncovered by 9to5Mac, LTE Apple Watch will indeed be able to make phone calls, send text messages, get calendar and mail updates, access apps using cellular data, all this independently from its paired iPhone. Carriers will also seemingly be able to offer plans at a promotional rate.
