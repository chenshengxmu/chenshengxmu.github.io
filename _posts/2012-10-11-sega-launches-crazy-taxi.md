* A few days ago, Sega announced that it would be bringing its popular Crazy Taxi title to the iOS platform. It posted a short video of gameplay footage, and said that its release date would be sometime in October.
* Well it looks like “sometime in October” meant “later this week,” because Crazy Taxi showed up in the App Store this morning. Now you can play the classic open-world driver on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch…
* Synopsis from the App Store description:
* “Hey hey, come on over and have some fun with Crrrrrazy Taxi! Barrel through traffic packed streets, hurdle off parking garages, and crazy combo your way to crazy money in a wild frantic race to scare up the most fares. In Crazy Taxi, time is money, and only the craziest cabbies come out victorious.”
* Some of the game’s more noteworthy features:
* Early feedback on the game has been fairly positive, with users giving it a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars. A few reviews have mentioned crashing problems on the iPod touch though. And there’s no iPhone 5 support yet.
* Issues aside, the folks who played this game back in the Dreamcast era will undoubtedly enjoy this blast from the past. If you want to check it out for yourself, you can snag Crazy Taxi from the App Store for $4.99.
* Have you played Sega’s latest iOS port yet?
