* Apple on Monday seeded the third beta of iOS 10 (build “14A5309d”) to developers. The release, which comes roughly two weeks after beta 2, is available to all registered iOS developers through Apple’s dev center.
* Beta 2 brought about several, though not necessarily significant, changes including a new Rest Finger to Unlock option, and enhancements to Notification Center, Messages and the stock Music app.
* Introduced in June, iOS 10 offers a number of new features and improvements. It’s compatible with the iPad 4 and later, the iPad mini 2 and later, the iPhone 5 and later, and the 6th gen iPod touch.
* We are currently installing today’s beta, and will be sure to report back with any notable changes. If you spot something we’ve missed, leave a comment below or email us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
