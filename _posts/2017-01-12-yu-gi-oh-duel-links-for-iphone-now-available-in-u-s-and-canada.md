* Keeping true to its promise, Konami today expanded the popular card-trading game Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links to App Stores in the United States and Canada following its soft-launch in Japan this past November.
* Available at no charge with non-compulsory In-App Purchases, the game brings to life the popular Yu-Gi-Oh! official trading card game, allowing Duelists to kindle the spirit of Yami Yugi, Seto Kaiba and other beloved characters in competitive card battle action.
* The game is based on the manga Yu-Gi-Oh!, which was serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1996, and the fifth iteration of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Although it includes In-App Purchases for things like additional three-card packs, you can earn in-game credit to where you don’t have to pay for it.
* Some minor differences from the actual card game: the iOS edition has less cards in the main deck and the gameplay field is limited to three monsters and spell or trap card zones. Other than that, the mobile game follows the same general rules as the original card-trading game and it comes with 700+ classic Monster, Trap and Spell cards.

* On the downside, there’s a limited number of non-playing characters that you can fight on the map. That wouldn’t be much of a problem if it weren’t for the fact that the wait time for them to respond can take ten or more minutes. Obviously, Konami wants to push players to buy an In-App Purchased upgrade so that the characters respond at a faster rate.
* Again, you can earn in-game currency fairly easily through missions to avoid buying upgrades with real cash.
* Check out the official trailer for the game.
* As mentioned, the game challenges you to battle Duelists from all over the world.
* You’ll summon monsters, traps and spells in an effort to reduce your opponent’s life points toward victory. As you encounter new challenges, you’ll unlock new characters, too. The game includes voiceover from familiar actors that lent their voice to the Yu-Gi-Oh! animated series in the United States (you can turn voiceover off in settings).
* I’ve played the game briefly and can confirm that the animations are dope. The cut scenes and CGI when summoning rare cards are especially awesome. If you’re a fan of manga, do yourself a favor and give this game a whirl.
