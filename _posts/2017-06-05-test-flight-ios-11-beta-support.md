* Just a few minutes ahead of the keynote presentation at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple has updated its TestFlight app with support for iOS 11 beta development.
* With the updated app, now at version 1.5.1, developers can now issue beta builds of their apps for testing on iOS 11 devices. AS you know, iOS 11 will be previewed at the conference today and released as a developer-only beta later in the day.
