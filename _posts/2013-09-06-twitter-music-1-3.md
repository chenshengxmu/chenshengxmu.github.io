* After updating its official iOS client with the somewhat controversial conversation redesign (hint: blue lines), the micro-blogging service Twitter now turns its attention to its music discovery app, Twitter #music. In a new update issued Friday, Twitter #music now shows tweets along with each track right in your #NowPlaying feed.
* “We’ve put the Twitter into Twitter #music,” the company boasted. That’s not all, as these tweets are fully actionable, which makes me wonder whether the company will eventually fold the #music app into the Twitter mobile client down the road…
* These tweets that appear in your #NowPlaying feed along with each track can be interacted with: you can reply to, retweet, favorite, email or message any Tweet.
* Other than this interesting feature, there are no other additions in this version of Twitter #music. Last month gave us a fairly substantial update which has brought out several improvements, like personalized recommendations based on analyzing your music library and enhanced artist pages and features.
* If you’re into music and love the Shazam song-matching service, their new Twitter Card can now play song previews that were shared from the Shazam app, right in your Twitter timeline.
* Download Twitter #music free from the App Store.
