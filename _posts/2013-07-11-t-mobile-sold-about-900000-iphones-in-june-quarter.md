* T-Mobile USA, the nation’s fourth-largest wireless carrier, started taking pre-orders for Apple’s iPhone on April 5, a week ahead of April 12 availability.
* Following the strong advertising push, the carrier then boasted about ‘gangbuster’ opening for the iconic smartphone, leaving us scratching our head as the headline-grabbing phrase left room for various interpretations in terms of hard data.
* The exact sales figure came to light during T-Mobile’s earnings call when we learned the Deutsche Telekom-owned telco sold half a million iPhones during its first month of availability, between April 5 and May 8.
* Though T-Mobile won’t report June quarter earnings until August 8, the company reportedly confirmed selling about 900,000 iPhones during the three-month period ended June 30. If true, the data point suggests the carrier has moved an additional 400,000 units between May 8 and June 30, but also that sales have slowed following the initial push…
* I found the figure in a tweet by Walter Piecyk, a wireless analyst at BTIG.
* “T-Mobile confirms iPhone sales ~900k for Q2. Yesterday we estimated 750-900k,” he tweeted out.
* During yesterday’s media event that saw the launch of Jump, T-Mobile’s anytime upgrade club for $10 a month, CEO John Legere mentioned the iPhone comprised 39 percent of April smartphone sales and about 29 percent of May sales.
* For reference, when Verizon Wireless and AT&T first launched the sought-after device, it commanded a 38 and 45 percent share on their network, respectively.
* By the way, T-Mobile Jump plans start on July 14, 2013.
* “May was better than April, and April was most of our ‘iPhone blip,’” Legere told AllThingsD yesterday. The arrival of the device on the T-Mobile network helped boost Apple’s U.S. market share, according to Kantar.
* “While smartphone sales over all have remained relatively stable in the 3 months ending May 2013, compared to the same period last year, iOS has grown, with a 3.5 percent increase during that time”, Kantar Worldpanel said Monday.

* His company, Legere argued, is benefiting from more than just an initial iPhone boost.
* “The Un-carrier approach is really what started to work”, the CEO told author Ina Freid.
* “But if AT&T and rivals want to think of T-Mobile’s gains as just an iPhone-related blip, Legere said ‘that’s beautiful'”, she wrote.
* T-Mobile scheduled June quarter earnings call on Thursday, August 8, 2013 at 11AM Eastern / 8AM Pacific.
* I’m really not surprised T-Mobile is seeing a drop in iPhone sales as fellow carriers suffer from the same syndrome amid a broader slowdown of the high-end. Samsung, for example, just lost $12 billion in market value after reporting a disappointing quarterly forecast and lower-than-expected smartphone sales.

* Apple’s growth is decelerating amid heightened competition, lack of new product categories and slowing iPhone sales. If you need more proof that the high-end is drying up, look no further than Verizon, the nation’s leading carrier.
* Bloomberg estimated this morning that Apple’s slowing iPhone biz may end up costing the big red carrier $14 billion over contractual obligations and unsold inventory.
* Taking it all in, I’m hardly surprised T-Mobile sold less iPhones in a little over a month and a half than it did during its first month of availability. After all, this is a nearly nine-month-old handset and the iPhone 5S is just around the corner.
