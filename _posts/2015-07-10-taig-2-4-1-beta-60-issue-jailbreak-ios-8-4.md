* Good news for those of you who are still experiencing issues with the TaiG jailbreak. A new beta version has been released to address issues with users who are getting stuck at 60% during the jailbreak process.
* Users who are already jailbroken will likely see a TaiG Untether update soon on Cydia once the 2.4.1 beta period ends. Check out the rest of our post for the release notes related to the release.
* Release notes:
* 1. V2.4.1 fixes the issue of getting stuck at 60% based on users’ feedback, optimizes the jailbreak process and improves its stability.
* 2. V2.4.1 is a beta version. If not necessary, you can use the previous version to jailbreak.
* You can download the TaiG 2.4.1 beta from our downloads page.
* As we suspected when TaiG first released a beta version of its tool with version 2.3.1, this looks to be a continuing trend—release a beta first, and then promote the beta to final once multiple users have tested it.
* Again, if you’re already jailbroken, there is no need to use this tool. Just wait for an update to the TaiG Untether package, and apply that once released on Cydia.
* Are you still experiencing issues with the jailbreak tool? Did this update help?
