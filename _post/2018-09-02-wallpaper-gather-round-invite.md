* Thursday, August 30, Apple sent out media invitations to the upcoming iPhone fall event. We are expecting to see two new handsets and a refresh ‘s’ version of the current iPhone X. This will place Apple’s handset line up sizes at 5.8″, 6.1″, and 6.5″.
* Each time a new invitation is released, the iDB wallpaper community rushes to create incredible images to celebrate the occasion. This is by far, the largest collection of event wallpapers we’ve ever posted. No surprise, fan favorite AR72014 is leading the charge with five different versions for iPhone. We are also excited to have options for iPad, Apple Watch, and desktop as well.
* The below collection is posted by creator and tagged appropriately. We are excited to be able to offer such an expansive collection and I’m personally thankful to the artists for sending me their submissions to @jim_gresham, where I curate all of our Wallpapers of the Week posts. This collection has images for all of your Apple devices and I received submissions from @AR72014, @Keir, @AJavier_E, @zooropalg and @mattbirchler. Tips came in from @muskingo and @mdJunaidKalam.

* For the following set of wallpapers by @mattbirchler, keep in mind they will fit for most screens, including up to 4K monitors. The resolutions are 3840 x 3840, which means you can set them on either of your devices and simply scale, or place it as you prefer. In fact, it looks pretty cool just to have a partial Apple Park ring on your iPhone.
