* Sunrise Calendar [review], a free iOS calendar alternative, has finally introduced long-expected support for Microsoft Exchange accounts for corporate calendars, making it on par with the stock iOS Calendar app.
* Now available free in the App Store, this much-expected feature in the new Sunrise Calendar version 2.2 makes it easy to connect your Exchange account directly in the app to access your work-related tasks and events on the iPhone and iPad.
* Support for Exchange accounts is in addition to the existing iCloud and Google calendar integration. Before linking your Exchange calendars with Sunrise, you must first add an Exchange account to your device in iOS Settings under Mail, Contacts, Calendars…
* In addition to Microsoft Exchange support, this edition of Sunrise Calendar has added a preference for the notification badge allowing you to choose between displaying the current date in the badge overlaid on the app’s icon on your Home screen or the number of unread invitations (Inbox Count).
* Sunrise Calendar debuted in the App Store in February 2013.
* It supports Background App Refresh, an iOS 7-exclusive feature that lets any app ask the operating system to periodically download content updates in the background, even if the app isn’t running.
* Download Sunrise Calendar 2.2 in the App Store.
* The universal app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
