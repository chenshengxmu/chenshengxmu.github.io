title: Did Apple Just Accidentally Confirm the 3G iPod Touch?

* Earlier this month, rumors were floating around the interwebs that Apple might be working on a 3G-capable iPod touch. Just like the iPad 3G, this iPod touch would have 3G data connectivity, allowing it to get internet access from virtually anywhere there is cell coverage.
* Today we received a tip from an iDB reader pointing us to a page on Apple’s website clearly showing an iPod touch with a 3G icon and signal strength in the status bar. Is this a hint from Apple that the company is indeed working on an iPod touch 3G?
* If you go to http://www.apple.com/itunes/, you will see an iPod touch with cellular data coverage information in the status bar. The only thing missing is a carrier icon, such as AT&T or Verizon.
* Is this a hint from Apple? I doubt it. Apple is not the kind of company that leaves obvious hints at what it’s currently working on. This could very well be an oversight from a member of their web development team, though.
* At any rate, if you didn’t believe Apple would release a 3G-capable iPod touch, this finding and the fact that Apple has added cellular toggles for the iPod touch in iOS 5 beta 4 are probably the most concrete evidence you’ll find to date.
* Still skeptical?
