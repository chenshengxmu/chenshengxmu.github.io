* Everyone who’s used a jailbroken iPhone before knows what the respring screen looks like. It displays a black screen with a white Apple logo if you have a black device, or a white screen with a black logo if you have a white device. On the other hand, if you’re jailbroken, then why have the same old screen everyone else has? You can customize it!
* A new free jailbreak tweak called Springy is going to give you more options to go down this road if you like customization.
* Springy is more than just a “customization” tweak for your respring screen. Instead, it’s a full-blown theme platform for the respring screen.
* It doesn’t matter if you’re a minimalist who likes only subtle changes to your stock installation of iOS, or if you like going balls to the wall with customization. Springy has features for everyone, and even the minimalists can enjoy what it has to offer.
* There are two main sections to the tweak’s feature set: 1) it’s a theme platform, and 2) it’s a jailbreak tweak. When you go into the tweak’s preferences pane in Settings → Springy, this becomes self-evident.

* The section labeled General Options can be considered the minimalist section, which lets you toy around with child’s play options and settings for the subtlest changes to your respring screen, such as inverting the colors or picking custom respring colors:

* One could also set a custom image as the respring page’s background if they wanted. A blue Reset to Defaults button at the bottom of the pane also lets users put everything back after they feel like they’ve “broken” the stock look beyond repair and want it back.
* On the other hand, if you’re a little more advanced in terms of customization and want something truly unique, then I think you’ll appreciate the theming aspect of this tweak, which can be found under the Animation Options section.

* In this section, you can apply themes you’ve created or downloaded from Cydia to the respring screen, toy around with the frames per second settings, and enable or disable animation looping.
* Currently, there are no themes available in Cydia publicly, and the tweak doesn’t come with any, but the developer offers two themes (Glitchy and Squid) from his personal repository, which you can add to Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and open the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* http://repo.aditkamath.com/
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* 5) Now you can check your Changes tab, and the new themes should appear in your list of recently-added tweaks.
* Because the Glitchy animation is my personal favorite, I’ll show you what it looks like via animated GIF:

* Notice how the screen appears to “bug out.” This is the animation, and it gives a really interesting effect that would normally freak out anyone who didn’t know what a jailbreak was. My opinion? Thumbs up!
* You can download Springy right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository completely free of cost, so check it out!
