* Like its predecessor, the iPhone 5 starts at $650 here in the US. That’s the full retail cost for the entry-level 16GB model, which is pretty expensive by most standards.
* Luckily, many carriers will pay for $450 of that, knocking the price down to $199, if you’re willing to sign a two year contract with them. How can they afford to do that?
* Oh don’t worry, they make their money back and then some…
* The folks over at Mashable have posted an interesting infographic by Avalaunch Media that shows a break down of all of the iPhone 5-releated expenses you’ll likely incur over the next two years if you purchase one on-contract. And a majority will go to your wireless provider.

* As the site points out, this graphic is fairly prescriptive, meaning not everyone will need a case, an armband etc. And to be honest, this isn’t necessarily just for the iPhone 5, as you would likely see similar prices with just about any other smartphone on the market.
* But still, it does give a nice overview of some of the costs you can expect to follow the initial $199 iPhone purchase, and how carriers are able to subsidize handsets.
* Thoughts?
