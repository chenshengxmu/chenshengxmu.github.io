* Engadget got words that Apple announced an iPhone 4.0 event that will be held on Thursday where the company will give a “sneak peak into the future of iPhone OS”.
* A few months ago, I wrote about 28 features I would like to see in OS 4.0 and I’m pretty sure the big news of the event will be around:
* These are just a few of my predictions. We’ll see how much I’m right/wrong. I’ll be staying up late here in Vietnam so I can give you a run down of the new OS as soon as it is unveiled.
* In the meantime, tell us what you would like to see in iPhone OS 4.0.
