* French blog NowhereElse.fr posted this morning claimed photographs of the iPhone 7’s back-facing iSight camera sensor. The leaked image strongly indicates that the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model will have optical image stabilization, a feature previously exclusive to iPhone 6/6s Plus models.
* For those wondering, the pictured part lacks an Apple logo likely because it’s a pre-production component. Assuming the part is genuine, the single-lens iSight camera on the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 may have relocated its L-shaped cable connector from the bottom center to the lower right side of the sensor.
* Optical image stabilization is evidenced by the four cutouts around the package to allow the camera lens to move slightly in all directions to compensate for the shakiness.
* The flagship iPhone 7 Plus model, of course, is widely expected to feature a dual-lens shooter for improved low-light photography, optical zoom and more.
* By and large, the iPhone 6s is Apple’s biggest camera jump ever: the back shooter went from eight to twelve megapixels for photo capture and from 1080p to 4K video capture. The front-facing FaceTime camera on the iPhone 6s was improved substantially as well, going from paltry 1.2 megapixels to a five-megapixel shooter with 720p video recording.
