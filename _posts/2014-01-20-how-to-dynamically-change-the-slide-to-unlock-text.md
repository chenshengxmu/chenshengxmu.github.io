* We’ve kicked off the week with an influx of new jailbreak tweaks for iOS 7 devices, ranging from Controllers for All and Animer7 to Fancy and Pluck 2. Those four packages are very interesting in themselves, but a smaller extension by the name of DynamicText deserves a quick look too. As you would expect, the tweak allows you to dynamically change text on iOS 7. Take a look ahead for a closer look… 
* DynamicText is configurable from its dedicated menu in the Settings app, although it is currently restricted to one option — the ability to type your name and have your Lock screen greet you dynamically. For instance, I typed in Joe and the traditional “Slide to Unlock” text has been replaced with “Evening, Joe” based on my time zone.
* While the tweak largely remains a work-in-progress, it is available now on Cydia in the BigBoss repository. Note that this tweak doesn’t work with arm64 devices for the time being. Give it a spin, and join us in the comments.
