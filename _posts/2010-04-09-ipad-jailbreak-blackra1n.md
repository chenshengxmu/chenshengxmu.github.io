title: GeoHot Reveals BlackRa1n iPad Jailbreak
---
* Things are going fast in the jailbreak world these days. One day after MuscleNerd announced the Dev Team had jailbroken iPhone OS 4, it’s GeoHot turns to impress us with a jailbreak for the iPad.
* Ealier today, GeoHot posted a tweet with a picture showing verbose mode running on his iPad. For info, verbose mode basically shows everything that your iPad is doing on bootup. It’s a clear sign that the iPad has been jailbroken.
* As if it wasn’t clear enough, GeoHot posted a more straightforward picture on his blog minutes ago showing a jailbroken iPad with the BlackRa1n and Cydia icons.

* When the picture was first posted on GeoHot’s blog, it had a caption under it saying that “The new app will not be called blackra1n”. This caption has since then been removed.
* The name doesn’t matter. Of course what really matters here is that GeoHot is once again the first to find a new jailbreak, this time for the iPad.
* There is no estimated release date but if I had a guess, I’d say that this new iPad jailbreak should hit the streets pretty soon. It seems like multitasking might come to the iPad earlier than Steve Jobs would want to after all…
* Thoughts?
