* Cydia isn’t quite bustling right now, but we’ve seen some exciting activity in the community recently by way of semi-jailbreaks and exploits that could potentially lead to something exciting on iOS 11 in the future. While there’s no guarantee of anything special coming out of it, we can still cross our fingers and hope for the best.
* Whether current versions of iOS will receive a jailbreak or not continues to baffle the best of us, but those sporting iOS 10 devices jailbroken with Yalu can still enjoy all of Cydia’s latest releases. In this roundup, we’ll talk about our favorite jailbreak tweaks launched during the past week. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites and outline the rest of them afterward.

* LockWatch Beta is a new jailbreak tweak available from the FESTIVAL repository in Cydia that brings Apple Watch-inspired watch faces to your jailbroken device’s Lock screen.
* While LockWatch Beta is still a work in progress, it’s coming together nicely. You can modify all of the watch faces just like you can on the Apple Watch, which means colorizing them, choosing their level of detail, and adjusting what they do and don’t display.
* The tweak comes with a slew of different watch faces to choose from, so there are options for both analog clock-lovers and digital clock-lovers alike.
* If you’re interested in learning more about LockWatch Beta, then be sure to read our in-depth review.

* PhotosLock is a privacy tweak for your Photos app that keeps honest people honest by passcode-locking your precious Photo Library.
* Whenever someone knows your device’s primary passcode, PhotosLock acts as a second line of defense that keeps your precious images to yourself. The passcode is entirely separate from the device’s primary passcode, and it can differ.
* PhotosLock is easily toggled on or off by zooming all the way out in the “Years” view of the Photos tab, but you’ll need to validate your passcode before it can be turned off.
* You can read our full review of PhotosLock to learn more about why it might be a good fit for your privacy needs.

* Snoverlay is a simple add-on meant to get you into the holiday spirit by displaying animated snowflakes over your Home screen and Lock screen wallpaper(s).
* Originally created by Ryan Petrich, Snoverlay was handed down to a new developer for continued development on iOS 10.
* The animated snowflakes appear in a layer existing between your wallpaper and home screen icons, which means they’ll never interfere with your app icon usage. Moreover, the animation is so subtle that it looks great and hardly impacts your battery life at all.
* If you’d like to learn more about how Snoverlay can help you get into the holiday spirit, then be sure to read our full review.
* BetterPowerMenu: An updated power down menu with customizable aesthetics and a respring option (free via BigBoss repo – review)
* Carrier Search Always: Enables the automatic carrier search option in Settings (free via BigBoss repo)
* FarewellGestureWaze: Removes the edge swipe gesture from the Waze app for accessing the menu (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repo – review)
* iPad Cam for iPhone (iOS 10): Brings the iPad-style Camera app UI to the iPhone (free via BigBoss repo – review)
* That just about wraps things up for this week’s roundup, but we’ll continue to keep you updated as new jailbreak tweaks surface. You might also consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope a little bit.
* In the meantime, check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special from last week. We also have a plethora of dedicated roundups that can help you find new tweaks for tricking out your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
