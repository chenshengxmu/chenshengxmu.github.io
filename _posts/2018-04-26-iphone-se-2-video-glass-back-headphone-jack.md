* Footage posted recently to Chinese social media suggests that Apple’s rumored second-generation iPhone SE may feature an all-glass back and the ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack.
* The iPhone 4s-style glass sandwich design should theoretically help engineers to add wireless charging capability to Apple’s most affordable handset. Contradicting the previous rumor, it looks like iPhone SE 2 might retain the ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack after all.
* The device appears to use a full glass backplate without the small glass panels at the top and bottom found on the original iPhone SE’s aluminum backplate. The word “iPhone” is printed on the back with no unsightly regulatory FCC logos, similar to Apple’s latest US phones.
* Watch the original video that MacRumors re-uploaded to YouTube.
* This could also be an iPhone knockoff from China.
* The fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara said recently that iPhone SE 2 might be coming some time in May. The device should feature Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor and run last year’s A10 Fusion chip that powers the iPhone 7 and 2017 iPad Pro devices.
* Aside from an all-glass back, iPhone SE 2 should retain the design and thickness of its predecessor although some analysts speculate that screen size may increase from four to 4.2 inches diagonally. That the upcoming phone won’t have 3D Touch is pretty much given.
* Are you looking forward to iPhone SE 2?
