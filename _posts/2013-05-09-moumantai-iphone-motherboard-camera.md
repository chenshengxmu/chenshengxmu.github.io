* As WWDC 2013 draws near – and with supply chain increasingly pointing to Apple’s procurement of components for production of a next-generation iPhone – small wonder various parts are now cropping up on the web. It’s the very nature of the game: Apple just can’t control each and every one of its suppliers in Taiwan and China, let alone their individual employees.
* A Japanese parts retailer, which recently leaked a next-gen iPhone components, is back at it, having published Thursday an image believed to depict a motherboard component, presumably belonging to an upcoming iPhone refresh…
* The top image pictures a part that could easily belong to an iPhone motherboard, which can be seen below. As for the differences, the end of the purported next-gen iPhone motherboard looks like it’s been tweaked compared to the iPhone 5 motherboard.
* Whereas the iPhone 5 circuitboard features separate ribbons connecting the camera and flash modules, the leaked part appears to depict a combined camera/flash component that strongly suggests a tweaked camera module design.

* The French blog Nowherelse.fr republished the component photo, obtained by Japanese retailer Moumantai. You may remember Moumantai from last month’s SIM tray component leak.

* As seen above, these iPhone 5S trays are pictured in gray and gold colors, a departure from the iPhone’s current black/slate and white/silver scheme.
* Assuming they’re legit,, these SIM trays conveniently match up with sporadic reports of colorized next-gen iPhones. For quite some time certain analysts and Apple’s supply chain folks have been adamant that the iPod-ization of the next iPhone will include a bunch of different color choices.
* Be that as it may, rumor mills agree Apple is now gearing up to mass-produce the next iPhone(s).
* Foxconn, the world’s top contract manufacturer, recently started hiring tens of thousands of workers “as we will start mass-producing the new iPhone soon,” Bloomberg reported.
* And earlier this morning, we learned that Apple’s other contract manufacturer, Pegatron, is now ramping up hiring ahead of a next-generation iPhone production.
* Who’s excited already?
