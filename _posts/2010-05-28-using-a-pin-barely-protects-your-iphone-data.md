title: Using A PIN Barely Protects Your iPhone Data
---
* So you thought that using a PIN was enough to protect your iPhone data? Think again! According to a recent report by Bernd Marienfeldt, your iPhone is highly vulnerable and leaves your data wide open, even if protected by a PIN.

* Sure a PIN can protect you from having the average thief dig into your data but someone with more technical knowledge and a computer running Ubuntu Lucid Lynx can easily navigate into the guts of your iPhone, even if it is locked and not jailbroken.
* According to Engadget: “The belief is that they’re just a buffer overflow away from full write access as well, which would surely open the door to making calls. Bernd believes the iPhone’s lack of data encryption for content is a real problem, and also cites the inability to digitally sign e-mails as reasons why the iPhone is still not ready for prime time in the enterprise.”
* What can you do right now to protect your data? Nothing. Just cross your fingers hoping that Apple will soon enforce data encryption for its devices.
