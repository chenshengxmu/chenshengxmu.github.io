* Luxury car maker Bentley has commissioned a short documentary film to promote its $300,000 Mulsanne.
* The black and white footage was captured entirely on an iPhone 5s and edited in the back of a Mulsanne on an iPad Air outfitted with a thin keyboard attachment.
* Entitled ‘Intelligent Details’ and filmed in the Bentley Mulsanne in New York, the video shows various design aspects of the car before revealing a behind-the-scenes of the entire process of capturing the footage. The team used specialized iPhone lenses and mounts to capture raw material, which was then editer on Apple’s tablet in iMovie….
* The promo video (via The Loop) was shot entirely on an iPhone 5s…

* …and edited using an iPad Air.

* The video runs four minutes and 25 seconds long and features Luc Donckerwolke, Director of Design, and SangYup Lee, Head of Exterior Design.
* Check it out below.
* I’m thinking they went all black-and-white because the dynamic range of the iPhone’s camera – or any other smartphone camera for that matter – is not satisfactory for such a complex shoot.
* YouTube description contains the following passage drawing parallels between Bentley’s design prowess and Apple’s attention to detail.
* The film highlights the fusion of luxury, performance and technology within the Bentley Mulsanne and reveals the manner in which Intelligent Details was filmed, assembled and edited using the in-car connectivity and entertainment platform.
* It’s a little unusual, to say the least, that a luxury automotive company of Bentley’s stature would allow such product placement for Apple, begging the question whether or not this is a PR stunt created in partnership with the California firm.
* The iPhone 5s was also the star of Burberry’s Spring/Autumn 2014 fashion show in London where the handset was similarly used to capture high-quality footage of the runway, beauty looks, product details and backstage moments.
* The difference between these two videos is that we know for a fact that Burberry actually partnered with Apple on this: Apple provided devices and camera rigs and later published the clip to its YouTube channel.
* At the time of this writing, Bentley’s video wasn’t published on Apple’s YouTube channel or the company’s homepage.
* Anyways, how did you like the Bentley clip?
* Is this an Apple commissioned film, do you think? Or, was it the other way round – that Bentley has purposefully used the Apple brand and its products in order to earn itself some free press?
