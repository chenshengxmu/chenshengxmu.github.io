* Now that Apple’s Dev Center is live again after an eight-day outage, the company is getting ready to release the fourth iOS 7 Beta later today, if prominent bloggers and Twitter are to be believed.
* In fact, a bunch of inactive download links for iOS 7 Beta 4 seem to be already up ahead of the official release on the Dev Center.
* And if you ask BGR, Apple will release just three more betas for developers before the Gold Master version is ready for prime time in early September…
* Jonathan S. Geller who runs BGR heard from multiple sources that Apple is planning to release iOS 7 Beta 4 today at around 1pm EDT / 10am PDT, over the air and through Dev Center.
* For what it’s worth, BGR recently nailed the iOS 7 Beta 3 release date. The upcoming build for an AT&T iPhone 5 should be hosted here (the Verizon download is here).
* More purported download links can be found in this MacRumors forum post.
* The well-informed Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac says the purported build number of iOS 7 Beta 4 is ’11a4435d’, adding:
* I heard last week that Apple is nearing an initial “GM1″ candidate internally. This candidate is said to be at a zero-priority-1 bug status, which means that there are no critical bugs left in the operating system.
* Of course, Apple will likely discover more bugs in its testing, and will likely have several internal GM candidates before releasing the final GM seed to developers later in the year.
* BGR was told that the fourth beta should contain “more bug fixes, graphics and UI enhancements and a couple of other updates”.
* Some non-developers who installed iOS 7 Betas took to Twitter to complain about the operating system’s sluggishness and a huge hit on battery, not realizing beta code is normally optimized for battery and graphics performance either in a Gold Master candidate or the beta preceding it.
* With that in mind, we’re expecting the fifth or sixth beta to be optimized for battery-friendly, jerk-free performance.
