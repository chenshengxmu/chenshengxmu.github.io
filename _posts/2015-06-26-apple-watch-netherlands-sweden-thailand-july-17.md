* Keeping true to its promise, the Apple Watch world tour continues as the Cupertino firm on Friday expanded device availability to an additional seven markets around the world: Italy, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. Customers in the aforesaid markets can now purchase the device from the Apple Online Store, Apple’s retail stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* In addition, Apple has refreshed its website to confirm that the wearable device will launch in The Netherlands, Sweden and Thailand on Friday, July 17.
* In addition to the seven new Apple Watch countries, a curated selection of the Apple Watch has become available today from select retailers like 10 Corso Como in Milan, BOONTHESHOP Cheongdam in Seoul and Malmaison by The Hour Glass in Singapore.
* The wrist-worn gizmo is also available for walk-in customers provided they have reserved their model using Apple’s Reserve & Pickup Apple Watch service. Apple has previously cautioned that walk-in sales in its brick-and-mortar stores will be available in a limited fashion, for “some models”only.
* Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
* Is the Apple Watch available in your country of residence and if so, will you be buying one soon?
