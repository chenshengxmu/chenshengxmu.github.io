* Hulu has posted a major update for its Hulu Plus iOS client, bringing the app to version 4.0. The update features a number of enhancements, including an all new design, new navigation options, and in-app subscriptions, which allows you to subscribe to the Hulu Plus service.
* In addition to these changes, the Hulu Plus app also received a new Search function, which now offers contextually grouped results to help you find what you’re looking for. The app has also been updated to support iOS 8, and to “run beautifully” on the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
* Here are the full release notes:
* We’ve redesigned the Hulu Plus app for iPhone from the ground up to create a focused and simple experience. Here are the key features:

* And there’s more, the new Hulu Plus app is compatible with iOS8 and runs beautifully on the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* For those unfamiliar with it, Hulu Plus is a subscription-based streaming video service that offers users on-demand access to thousands of movies, TV shows and additional content. It’s available on a number of platforms, including [obviously] both iPhones and iPads and Apple TV.
* Hulu Plus costs $7.99 per month, which you can now have charged to your iTunes account. If you’re interested, there is a free 7-day trial available, and Hulu allows you to browse through its content library to see what it offers. The Hulu Plus app can be found in the App Store for free.
