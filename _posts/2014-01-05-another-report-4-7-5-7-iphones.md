* Since just before Apple unveiled the iPhone 5s last September, we’ve been hearing rumors that the company’s eighth-generation handset is going to feature a larger display. Reports are calling for sizes from 4.8-inches all the way up to 6-inches.
* But there’s also another theory—first started by Reuters last June—going around that Apple is working on two larger screen iPhone models: one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.7-inch display. And a new report out of China adds to the mix…
* Here’s the translated report from Sina Weibo (via iClarified):
* “A report coming in from China cites multiple Foxconn insiders who have apparently revealed that Apple is going to release a 4.7 inch and a 5.7 inch iPhone later this year. Both iPhones will reportedly come with fingerprint scanners as well.”
* And here’s the original report from Reuters for added context:
* “Apple is looking at introducing at least two bigger iPhones next year – one with a 4.7-inch screen and one with a 5.7-inch screen – said the sources, including those in the supply chain in Asia. They said suppliers have been approached with plans for the larger screens, but noted it is still unclear whether Apple will actually launch its flagship product in the larger sizes.”
* I’ll be the first to admit that the idea of Apple launching two new iPhones with different display sizes this year sounds odd, it’s worth noting that this thesis has been corroborated by several other publications, including the well-sourced DisplaySearch.

* I also think Apple tossed traditionalism out the window when it unveiled two new iPhones last fall. So it’s very possible that the company is finally opening up to the idea of expanding its smartphone lineup in an attempt to hit multiple market segments.
* Of course, this is all speculation at this point, and this is just one of the many rumors floating around about Apple’s product plans for 2014. The company is also expected to release a larger 12-inch iPad this year, as well as a smartwatch or wearable.
* Thoughts?
