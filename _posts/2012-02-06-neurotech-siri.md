title: The Best Looking Siri Theme Yet

* Neurotech Siri is an absolutely amazing looking theme for Siri, and really, the pictures and video don’t totally do it justice.
* This is a WinterBoard theme that features almost 300 frames of animation on the Siri logo, and you can tell from the fluidity and smoothness when invoking Siri.
* Other Siri themes have changed the mic color, or added an Apple logo, but those all pale in comparison to this…
* Neurotech Siri adds a themed Siri icon to both normal Siri, and the dictation elements. It also included a new weather theme for Siri and clock elements. On top of that, you get a cool looking battery lock theme thrown in for good measure.
* The only downside to this theme is that it uses WinterBoard, but honestly, it looks so good I’m willing to live with that. If this is a sign of what’s to come, I can’t wait to see what kinds of crazy themes the community will come up with. Hat tip to KingAtlas89 for letting us know this even existed.
* Neurotech Siri can be downloaded from Cydia for $1.00. You will need a jailbroken device in order to use this. Obviously a jailbroken iPhone 4S is ideal, but it should also work with pre-4S devices running Spire.
* I think this theme is fantastic, what about you?
