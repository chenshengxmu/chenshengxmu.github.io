* Apple has released iOS 8, the latest version of its mobile operating system, to the public on Wednesday after months of testing by developers.
* iOS 8 has been months in the making and was unveiled for the first time in June, at Apple’s annual developers conference. Building on the foundations of iOS 7, iOS 8 can be qualified as a more opened version of the operating system, as developers are now able to tap deeper into the software and offer more powerful features to iOS users.
* The update, available now as an over-the-air download (directly from your device) or via iTunes, brings several enhancements to iOS 7. Because this is a worldwide release, users who are trying to update or download iOS 8 might experience connectivity issues. If that is the case, we suggest you arm yourself with patience and try again a little later.
