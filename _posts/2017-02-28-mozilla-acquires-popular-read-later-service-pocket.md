* Mozilla, the non-profit organization behind the Firefox browser, has acquired the read-later service Pocket for an undisclosed sum. The deal files as Mozilla’s first acquisition and was confirmed by both Mozilla and Pocket.
* I’ve been a longtime Pocket user because their elegantly designed cross-platform apps let me easily save stripped down versions of articles from online publications for reading later, even without an Internet connection.
* Pocket will continue on as a wholly-owned, independent subsidiary of Mozilla. Pocket has native apps on App Store and Mac App Store, plus a browser extension.
* Pocket started under the original name Read It Later a decade ago. According to Recode, the service has managed to pick up around ten million active monthly users.
* “Pocket will join Mozilla’s product portfolio as a new product line alongside the Firefox web browsers with a focus on promoting the discovery and accessibility of high quality web content,” said Mozilla.
* “Pocket’s core team and technology will also accelerate Mozilla’s broader Context Graph initiative.” For those unfamiliar with it, Mozilla’s Context Graph initiative uses browser activity to enhance web discovery.

* The Pocket team added that their roadmap is clearer than ever.
* “In fact, we have a few major updates up our sleeves that we are really excited to get into your hands in the coming months,” they said.
* The Verge’s Casey Newton thinks Mozilla bought Pocket for its recommendation engine.

* Pocket’s apps and service used to be free, but advanced functionality now requires a premium tier, a $4.99 per month or $44.99 per year value. Pocket fans who used the app to strip ads from online publications should check out Safari’s Reader Mode which strips away all ads and navigation.
* Mobile and desktop editions of the Safari browser also offer a Reading List feature for saving articles across devices to read later, in offline mode.
* Pocket apps are available at no charge from App Store and Mac App Store.
