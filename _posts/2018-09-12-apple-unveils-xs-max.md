* Among the new products Apple has announced at its Gather Round event this morning is the iPhone Xs Max. As the rumor mill predicted, this new handset features a 6.5-inch OLED panel, which Apple has branded a Super Retina display. It features a resolution of 458 ppi, 1-million-to-1 contrast ration, and support for Dolby Vision and HDR10.
* Additionally, the iPhone Xs Max features a 120Hz touch-sensing, of course 3D Touch, Tap to wake, True Tone display tech, support for Wide Color and iOS system-wide color management. Note that these features aren’t exclusive to the larger handset—the 5.8-inch iPhone Xs also has them. It seems display size will be the biggest differentiator between the two devices.

* From Apple’s press release:
* “iPhone Xs is packed with next-generation technologies and is a huge step forward for the future of the smartphone. Everything is state of the art including the industry-first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with 8-core Neural Engine, faster Face ID and an advanced dual camera system that shoots Portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone Xs is not one, but two new iPhone models, and iPhone Xs Max offers the biggest display ever in an iPhone with the biggest battery ever in an iPhone, delivering up to an hour and a half more battery life in your day.”
