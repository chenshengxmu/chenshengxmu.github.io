* If you’ve been around jailbreaking for any measurable amount of time, the name “Barrel” has a significant meaning for you. It’s the tweak that I, and many others, view as the flagship jailbreak tweak. It’s the tweak that represents jailbreaking as a whole.
* Barrel is the type of tweak that you use to convince skeptical friends that they should jailbreak, and often the end result is that they do. No, Barrel isn’t a tweak that will improve the usability of your device, such as biteSMS’ quick reply. It’s not a practical release like iFile, or Safari Download Manager. But it’s still one of the first tweaks that come to mind when a new jailbreak arrives.
* I’m happy to say that Barrel has been updated to support iOS 7. In fact, it works beautifully on my iPhone 5s. If you’re new to jailbreaking and don’t know what Barrel is, then I invite you to step inside and enjoy the visual roller coaster.
* Barrel allows users to insert awesome transitions between pages on the iPhone’s Home screen. The transitions happen whenever you swipe between a page, and they can range from a subdued fade-in, to the radical-looking snake transition that just happens to be my favorite.
* Barrel includes well over a dozen different transitions to choose from, and if you can’t decide on one, you can opt for the random select transition that will keep you guessing with every page swipe. The great thing about Barrel is that transitions can be changed on the fly, so there is no need to respring.
* Aaron Ash, the creator of Barrel, is offering the tweak on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $2.99. I firmly believe that Barrel is worth your hard earned money. Chances are you already own it, but if you’re new to the jailbreak community, or you somehow looked it over, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
* Do you own Barrel? Do you still use it to showcase jailbreaking? Sound off in the comments below.
