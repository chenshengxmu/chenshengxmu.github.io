* Apple has just become the world’s first $700 billion company, after shares of AAPL closed at $122.02, a new split-adjusted all-time high for the iPhone giant.
* With this record close, Apple now sits at a massive $710,000,000,000 market cap – twice the size of Microsoft and largely beating oil-giant Exxon, who is in second-place at $385 billion.
* Apple’s stock has been roaring back to life after Apple’s record iPhone sales smashed analyst estimates, the company has been giving more money back to shareholders, and it reached a $100 billion cash reserve.
* The record came as Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, was speaking at the Goldman Sachs conference on Tuesday.

* Previously, there had been years of doubt from analysts that Apple could fend off competitors like Samsung. Apple’s record on Tuesday comes two weeks after it reported earnings of $18 billion on revenue of $74.6 billion during the holiday quarter.
* Market value is common for investors to measure how much a company is worth. It is determined by multiplying the company’s shares outstanding by its stock price. Apple has 5.82 billion shares outstanding, multiplied by the closing price of $122.02.
