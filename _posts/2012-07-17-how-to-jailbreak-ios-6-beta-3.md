* Now that the iPhone Dev Team has released RedSn0w 0.9.13dev3, it’s easy to jailbreak the latest iOS 6 beta 3 release. This jailbreak will also work with previous versions of iOS 6 beta, such as iOS 6 beta 2.
* Bear in mind that this is still a tethered jailbreak, and it will not install Cydia on your device. Since you must point to the current beta firmware, you need to be a developer so that you can access iOS 6 beta 3.
* If you meet these requirements, then step right inside as we walk you though using RedSn0w 0.9.13dev3 to jailbreak an iPhone 4 running iOS 6 beta 3.
* Step 1: Download and run RedSn0w 0.9.13dev3.
* Step 2: Place your device into DFU mode.
* Step 3: In RedSn0w click Extras > Select IPSW and point to your iOS 6 beta 3 firmware. RedSn0w should display a message stating that the firmware was successfully identified.
* Step 4: Go back to the main page of RedSn0w and click jailbreak. Once preliminary configuration is complete, ensure Install SSH is selected, and continue. The jailbreak process should finish to completion.
* Step 5: Once back to the Home screen on your device, place the device back into DFU mode, and perform Step 3 again.
* Step 6: Click Just boot under the Extras menu subset, and RedSn0w will perform a tethered boot on your device.
* That’s all there is to it, your device should now be jailbroken running iOS 6 beta 3. Keep in mind that while this will install SSH on your device, it will not install Cydia. If you want Cydia, then try our iOS 6 Cydia installation tutorial.
* Are you a developer who’s successfully jailbroken your iOS 6 beta 3 device? Sound off in the comments below.
* Update: After further testing, I’ve discovered that the Cydia method described above no longer works for me with beta 3. I apologize if the post was misleading in any way.
