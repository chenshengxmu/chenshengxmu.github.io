* Apple has added transit options to its Maps app for the city of Paris, TechCrunch reported Monday. Customers can now use Apple Maps on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple Watch to calculate itineraries using the available public transportation options which include subway, RER and busses lines, among others.
* For Parisians, Apple Maps now shows subway, RER and bus lines operated by the RATP Group.
* It also displays Transilien lines, as well as Autolib car sharing stations and Vélib bike sharing stations. All station entrances are properly identified on a map, making them easier to find.
* Users will also find a new subway layer that can be used to calculate an itinerary from A to B.
* Simply tap a station to see all the lines leaving it and get information about the next departures, updated in real-time.
* Rival Google Maps has provided transit data in Paris for years, but Google’s service doesn’t show the next departures. Apple Maps transit data is available across many cities in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Japan and elsewhere.
* MacRumors adds that transit directions may soon be enabled in Adelaide and Perth in Australia, Las Vegas, Madrid, Phoenix, Rome, Singapore, Taiwan and the Netherlands. Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage lists the cities in which Apple Maps supports transit data.
