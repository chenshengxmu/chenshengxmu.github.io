* Fantastical 2, one of the apps that many of us agree is an absolute must have, has been updated with tons of improvements, bug fixes, and optimizations. If you have automatic updates enabled for your iOS device and you already own Fantastical 2, you may have already received the update. Otherwise, you can head over to the App Store to download it now.
* Coming in at 16.3 MB, version 2.0.1 of Fantastical 2 adds sound to notifications, brings additional app icon badge options, and lends iPhone 4 users a performance boost. Those are among the many additional changes and fixes added in with version 2.0.1. Check inside for a rundown of the full change log.
* Here is what you can expect to find after updating Fantastical 2 to version 2.0.1:
* As Sebastien pointed out in his review, as far as calendar apps go, “Fantastical is still the best out there.” For that reason, we think you’d be silly not to jump on the Fantastical’s $2.99 introductory price to celebrate its launch, which is 50% off of the real price.
* Like Sebastien noted, Fantastical 2 isn’t just a rebrand of the original Fantastical with a fresh coat of paint. It’s basically a brand new app, and it’s ridiculously good at what it does.
* Now how about that iPad version, Flexibits?
