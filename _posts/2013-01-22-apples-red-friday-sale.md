* Apple announced its annual Lunar New Year sale last night, a one day shopping event for Asian countries that is similar to November’s Black Friday event. The sale, dubbed “Red Friday,” is set to take place on January 25.
* As with its popular Black Friday event, Apple will be offering up deals on its Macs, iPads, and iPod products, as well as many of its in-house accessories like the Magic Mouse, Bluetooth keyboard and Smart Cover…
* As noted by MacRumors, last year’s Red Friday sale saw discounts of up to 8% on iPads, 10% on iPod touches, and a level discount of HK$770 (or $99.31 USD) on MacBook laptop models. It also included free two-day shipping.
* The shopping event will kick off on Friday morning in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. And if you’re looking for gift ideas, Apple recently published a Chinese New Year Gift Guide.
