* Anyone with a jailbroken iOS 10 device presumably avoids the power down menu because of their semi-untethered jailbreak. On the other hand, a new free jailbreak tweak called BetterPowerMenu iOS developer Huub Lubbers can change that.
* The tweak makes two significant changes to the power down menu, such as adding a respring button and supplying customization options so that you have more control over how the interface looks and feels.
* You’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app after installation where you can tinker with the aesthetics:

* Here, you can:
* A respring button at the bottom of the preference pane saves your changes whenever you adjust the tweak.
* One thing we noticed while testing BetterPowerMenu is how it adds haptic feedback to the power button. You’ll feel the vibration after holding the power button long enough to invoke the power down menu.
* Admittedly, I’m partial to the aesthetic of the stock power down menu, and Ma Jun’s PowerDown suits my needs better. On the other hand, BetterPowerMenu’s configuration settings stand out from the competition and may offer some leverage in your decision as you choose the right tweak for yourself.
* If you want to give BetterPowerMenu a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
