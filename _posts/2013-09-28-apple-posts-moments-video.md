* Folks who missed any of the Festival’s performances, which included global superstars like Robin Thicke, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and Jack Johnson, can watch them using the dedicated iOS or Apple TV app.
* At the iPhone event earlier this month, Tim Cook announced that more than 20 million people applied for free iTunes Festival tickets, and that Apple has been able to stream the event to over 100 countries.
