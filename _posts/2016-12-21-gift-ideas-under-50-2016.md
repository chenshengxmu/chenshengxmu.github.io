* I’ve been including the Mini Jambox in my gift guides for a few years now with its $100+ price tag, so of course I had to mention here at this price. The Jambox Bluetooth speaker line is known for its sharp design, ease of setup and of course great sound. The mini model features all of these things in an even more portable package. I have like 5 or 6 Bluetooth speakers laying around, and I’d still love to get one of these as a gift.
