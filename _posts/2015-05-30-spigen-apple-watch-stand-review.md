* Spigen has been on the forefront of Apple Watch accessories since the device was first available a little over a month ago. The company rapidly came up with a line of cases for Apple Watch, and they also made a stand that represents an affordable yet elegant solution for your desk or night stand.
* In a brief review of the Spigen Apple Watch Stand, I’ll share with you what I like and don’t like about this simple accessory.
* Made of aluminum that conveniently matches the finish of your MacBook or iMac, the Spigen Apple Watch Stand has a circular cut-out fitted with a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) top that will not only cradle the conductive charger that came with your device, but also prevents your watch from being scratched when placed on the stand.
* Initial set up of the charger is a breeze. Simply push the inductive charger into the TPU cradle where it will fit snugly, and have the length of the cable go though a side cut-out all the way to your wall charger or USB port.
* By design, the charging cable will always be visible, which is probably my main grip with the Spigen Apple Watch Stand. I wish that somehow Spigen would have been able to make it so the cable leaves from below the base of the stand. The cable would have still been visible, but it would be in a more discrete manner.
* That cable…

* When placed on the stand, the watch is propped at a 45 degree angle for what appears to be ideal viewing. The magnetic charger prevents Apple Watch from sliding off, while letting you see the screen and even use the device if you choose to.
* The TPU cradle is also the source of a small dislike to me. Not because it doesn’t work (it does a great job at what it is supposed to do), but because the black plastic clashes with the overall esthetic of the stand. I keep thinking that a gray or white cradle might have been a better option. Of course, this is just one man’s opinion.
* Personally, I couldn’t live with this stand on my night stand. It was just taking too much space and made me realize that I didn’t really need an accessory dedicated to charging my watch. The minimalist in me is still looking for a more simple, and maybe a “flatter” solution.

* The stand does look great on my desk though. As mentioned above, it matches the aluminum of my iMac and my Twelve South HiRise for iPhone. But just like I didn’t want to make room on my night stand for a charging accessory, I don’t feel like using a stand on my desk either, especially considering I only charge my watch at night. Again, this is just my opinion and actually has nothing to do with the accessory itself.
* This being said, this is a great stand for your Apple Watch, especially at that price. Don’t let my minimalism deter you from ordering this Apple Watch stand from Amazon, where it is available for $19.99. As I mentioned above, the Spigen Apple Watch Stand is simple, well crafted, elegant, and maybe more importantly, it does a great job at holding your Apple Watch in place while charging it.
