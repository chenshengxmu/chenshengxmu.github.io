* Google has just updated its Gmail iOS app with multiple account support, a way overdue feature which finally allows you to set up, use and switch between up to five different Google accounts with just a few taps.
* Gmail version 2.0, a major overhaul, in addition to a much cleaner and sleeker look has learned a few useful new tricks, like infinite scrolling inbox, threaded conversations, profile pictures, search predictions and auto-complete contact names, to name a few.
* But the list of enhancements doesn’t end there. Numerous new animations from swivels to transitions will dazzle you. Plus, you can now respond to Google Calendar invites inline, set up real-time notifications for new mail or take advantage of the interactive Google+ posts support to +1 and comment on Google+ posts inline. There’s also a new app icon and a redesigned welcome experience. Do any of these features ring a bell? Profile pictures? Multiple accounts? Threaded conversations?
* Yup, seems Google made good on its promise to leverage May’s Sparrow acquisition towards improving the Gmail mobile experience. The search firm occasionally refreshes Sparrow with maintenance updates, like last month when the Sparrow app gained iPhone 5 and Passbook support…
* Let’s not forget about the new icon.

* According to the official Gmail blog, six months ago the team set out to “completely rebuild the Gmail app for iPhone and iPad to give you you a faster, sleeker, and easier experience on iOS”.
* Here, two more screenies from the iPhone version.
* Multiple accounts on the left and profile pictures on the right

* I for sure am happy about inline Google Calendar invites, seen below.

* If you don’t see the new version in the App Store, just give it a little while longer.

* Don’t worry, these things take time to propagate, the Gmail team tweeted.
* Looks like the new Gmail app for iOS is still rolling out on iTunes.If you’re having trouble, try again later.

* You’re advised to updated, the new build is really awesome and elevates the experience up to the point where Gmail could easily become my default replacement for the stock iOS Mail app.
* Let us know about your favorite features down in the comments.
