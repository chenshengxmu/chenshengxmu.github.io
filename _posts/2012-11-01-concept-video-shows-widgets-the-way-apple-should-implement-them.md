* If you’ve had an Android device in your hands before, you’ve likely noticed they usually come with widgets for just about anything. As a matter of fact, when I reviewed the Nexus 7 a few months ago, I noted that widgets were definitely one of the strong points of the tablet. Of course, jailbreakers are no strangers to widgets: Dashboard X is an example of how widgets can be implemented in a very tasteful way on iOS.
* Visual and UI designer Max Rudberg recently took it upon himself to imagine another way widgets could work on iOS. The result is quite amazing, and in all honesty, I believe Apple should really take note of Rudberg’s concept. Have a look for yourself…
* In this concept, an app icon can be resized from 1×1 to 2×2 or 4×2, similarly to how you would on Windows Phone 8. The increased size can house widget like functionality and provide easy access to core features of that particular app. For example, you could expand the Settings icon into a widget with a brightness slider, and quick toggles for WiFi, Bluetooth, Personal Hotspot and Do Not Disturb.
* If the name Max Rudberg sounds familiar, it’s probably because you’ve seen his work before. The designer is responsible for the Glasklart theme, and many more GUI jobs, including some interesting concept videos we featured before on iDB.
* Call them ugly, tacky, or whatever you want, widgets can be extremely useful, and although Apple and pundits have always raised their voice against the implementation of widgets in iOS, I believe it’s just a matter of time until we see those on the Home screen of the iPhone or iPad. Rudberg clearly shows the way in this video.
* What’s your take on it?
