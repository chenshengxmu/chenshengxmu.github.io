* Considering the amount of people who have asked us if their cases will be compatible with the new phones, it’s worth underscoring that Apple’s own case lineup for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will indeed fit the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and vice versa.
* As iDownloadBlog reader Adam Baligian observed on Twitter, Apple’s own iPhone 6s Accessories webpage states that existing cases “fit snugly and your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6 still feels incredibly slim,” even with the case on.
* Both sizes of the Leather Case and Silicon Case series are confirmed as being compatible with the latest and previous-generation iPhones.
* The Leather Case for iPhone 6/6s costs $45 and the Leather Case for iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus is a $49 value.  The leather case lineup is available in Midnight Blue, Saddle Brown, Rose Gray, Brown and Black.

* The Silicon Case for iPhone 6/6s is priced at $35 while the Silicon Case for iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus is priced at $39. These cases come in White, Charcoal Gray, Stone, Antique White, Blue, Turquoise, Midnight Blue, Lavender, Pink, Orange and Red finishes.

* The Leather Case ships in five to seven business days and the Silicon Case is listed with a shipping time of 1-3 business days. The Leather Case and the Silicon Case will be available for in-store pickup soon, according to the Apple Online Store.
* Accessory maker Spigen confirmed yesterday that its existing iPhone 6 cases will fit the new phones. Other case makers have made similar confirmations, like Speck whose old iPhone 6/6 Plus cases will fit the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus, and vice versa.
* Though the vast majority of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cases will fit the new phones, those that are totally rigid might not as trim-fitting cases have much tighter tolerances so they either won’t fit or will bulge.
