* Premium audio company Bose Corp. and the now Apple-owned Beats Electronics have settled their patent infringement suit, reports Bloomberg. The two companies a U.S. court in Delaware they’ve settled their claims, and asked the International Trade Commission to cease its investigation.
* Bose originally filed the complaint against Beats in July, claiming that Beats Studio and Studio Wireless headphones, which both feature “adaptive noise cancelation,” infringe on five of its noise-canceling patents. Clearly a settlement was reached here, but terms of the deal were not disclosed.
* The news comes as a bit of surprise, as tensions between the two headphone-makers heated up this week. Bose struck a new partnership with the NFL, barring players from wearing Beats and other non-sponsored cans while on camera, and the league has already begun doling out fines to violators.
* Things could escalate even further in the coming weeks, if rumors that Apple is pulling Bose products from its retail stores turn out to be true. Earlier today, MacRumors reported that Apple Stores are being instructed to begin removing all Bose audio gear from shelves and demo tables next week.
* Apple, of course, completed it’s $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in August.
