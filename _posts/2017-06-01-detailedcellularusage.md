* Cellular data is one of those things we seem to always use regularly, but fail to keep track of as efficiently as we could. This becomes a problem when you swear your data provider is over-charging you for your data usage.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called DetailedCellularUsage by TheComputerWhisperer helps reveal some of the gray areas where iOS uses your cellular data and doesn’t report it in the Settings app.
* As you probably know, you can go to Settings → Cellular on your iPhone or cellular-enabled iPad to see what apps are using the your cellular data, but what you might not know is that some items are hidden by Apple by default.

* What DetailedCellularUsage does is reveal the hidden items so you get the most accurate depiction possible of what’s using your cellular data behind the scenes.
* Among some of the things that are typically hidden are iAd data usage and the amount of data used from setting up your iPhone for the first time after a restore, while there are probably others, these are the only ones we encountered during testing.
* Moreover, if you go into the System Services cell, you’ll see that the tweak also unlocks a wide range of information that’s normally hidden:

* The tweak might not be for everyone, but if you’re a power user and you’re concerned about the amount of data you’re using every month, the tweak can help shed light on some of the system processes that are eating into your capped data plan.
* DetailedCellularUsage is available as a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices.There are no options to configure after installation.
* Cellular data access is required to visit the Cellular preferences pane in the Settings app, so this will not work on iPod touches or Wi-Fi-only iPads.
* As a bonus, if you see yourself using too much of your cellular data every month, we recommend reading our detailed piece about how to keep your iPhone’s data usage to a minimum.
