* I know this is not directly related to anything iPhone but I thought the news was important enough to report here on iDB. According to The Escapist, Geohot fled the country and is currently in South America.
* In case you didn’t know, Geohot is currently being sued by Sony for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3, and even though he pretends to be confident about the situation, he is clearly feeling the heat coming from the Japanese electronics giant…
* Sony claims that Hotz has now left his home in New Jersey and traveled to South America in order to escape further legal action.
* “After Magistrate Judge Spero ordered an inspection of Hotz’s devices and ordered Hotz to appear at a deposition in California, SCEA learned that Hotz had deliberately removed integral components of his impounded hard drives prior to delivering them to a third party neutral and that Hotz is now in South America, an excuse for why he will not immediately provide the components of his hard drives as requested by the neutral,” the motion read.
* Things don’t really look up for the little prodigy. Let’s wish him good luck.
* Update: He didn’t flee the country. He’s just on vacation in South America, as explained on his blog.
