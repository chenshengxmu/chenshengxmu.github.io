* Online retailer Amazon has stepped up its game on the iOS platform. Just as it updated its Cloud Player with a new scan-and-match service akin to iTunes Match and featuring high-quality 256Kbps song downloads for both music purchases and ripped CDs, the company today released a brand new video app which enables streaming of video content available through the company’s Prime service and Instant Video store.
* It supports offline viewing, automatic syncing of your play state across various devices and platforms and more. More screenies right after the break…
* The new Amazon Instant Video app lets you either stream or mark for download and later offline viewing any previously purchased video.
* It also works with Amazon’s Prime membership, which costs $79 a year in exchange for unlimited access to over 120,000 videos.
* A selection of top Prime Instant Video titles is included in the app so you have something to boot from. Tapping Amazon’s Whispersync tech, the program syncs your play state across a bunch of devices such as the Kindle Fire, PS3, PC, Mac or hundreds of models of connected TVs and Blu-ray players.

* Amazon Instant Video is a free download. Unfortunately, it only supports the iPad so perhaps the program will get updated at a later stage with the native iPhone / iPod touch support.
* Amazon’s move follows yesterday’s release of the Hulu Plus service for the Apple TV set-top box, along with a free one-week trial.
* Here, your release notes.
* • Stream thousands of titles available from Prime Instant Video at no additional cost with a Prime membership, or watch over 120,000 videos available from the Amazon Instant Video store • Download purchased and rented videos from Your Video Library • Shop over 120,000 videos available from the Amazon Instant Video store by visiting Amazon • Add videos to your Watchlist from a PC, Mac, or Kindle Fire for later viewing on your iPad • Subscribe to a TV Season Pass by visiting Amazon and episodes will automatically be available on your iPad the day after they air • Start watching on your iPad, and resume watching right where you left off on a Kindle Fire, PS3, PC, Mac, or hundreds of models of connected TVs and Blu-ray players with Amazon Whispersync.
