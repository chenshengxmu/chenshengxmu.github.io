* A popular automation tool for iPhone and iPad, Workflow, was updated on App Store this morning with several new iOS 11 and iPhone X features.
* Workflow, acquired by Apple in March 2017, is now fully optimized for iOS 11 and iPhone X.
* It’s implemented support for iOS 11’s drag and drop on compatible iPad models, allowing you to drop content onto a workflow to run the workflow with that input. Support for HEIF, Apple’s new image format in iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, has been added to the Convert Image action while the Encode Media action has gained support for HEVC (H.265) media.
* Several new Health data types introduced in iOS 11 are now supported in your workflows as well, including Insulin Delivery, V02 Max, Waist Circumference, Resting Heart Rate, Walking Heart Rate Average and Heart Rate Variability.
* Other tidbits in this release include the ability to retrieve and save multiple files at a time in the Get File and Save File actions, specify a default FROM address for the compose sheet in the Send Email action and add TaskPaper under specific folders, projects and tasks in OmniFocus.
* Workflow is a free download from App Store.
