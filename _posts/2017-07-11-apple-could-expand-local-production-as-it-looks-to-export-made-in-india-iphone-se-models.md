* The Economic Times of India reported today that although Apple is in no hurry to assemble additional models in India beyond iPhone SE, it is allegedly planning to eventually expand production capacity and bring “Made in India” devices to overseas markets.
* “Apple will focus on iPhone SE model both for India and overseas markets,” a government official said. “It is looking to start exports from India,” the person added.
* Apple’s manufacturer Wistron has been assembling a limited run of “Made in India” iPhone SE models for two months now in a facility set up at Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru.
* Those phones currently don’t ship overseas and don’t carry a lower price tag even though they’re made locally. Government officials aware of the matter say Wistron has not made any fresh request for approval.
* “Apple will stick to making iPhone SE model at its Bengaluru plant for some more time and has no immediate plan to assemble its flagships iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in the country, according to the government source quoted earlier.
* Just yesterday, the same publication reported of Apple’s alleged plans to expand local production. According to that article, Apple could manufacture other iPhone models in India at a later stage and even set up a full-fledged manufacturing plant.
* Apple is also planning to open its largest global store to date in India by 2020.
* It’s reportedly looking at 4-5 flagship outlets limited to metros over 5-10 years. The stores will be located at prime locations and should have enough class to make them tourist attractions.
* Lastly, the Cupertino giant could launch a dedicated online store in India by October.
