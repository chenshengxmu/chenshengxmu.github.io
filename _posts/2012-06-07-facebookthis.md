* Don’t feel like waiting for iOS 6 for native Facebook integration? Then try FacebookThis on for size.
* While it won’t give you system-wide Facebook integration at the level that’s bound to be present in iOS 6, it will lend you the ability to easily share your photos directly from your Camera Roll. Want to see how this jailbreak tweak works in action? Take a look inside for a hands-on video walkthrough…
* To use FacebookThis, simply open a photo, and tap the share button in the bottom-left corner. You will then be presented with a new “Facebook” option amidst the rest of the share options. On first use, you will have to identify with Facebook and allow sharing, but after that you can start posting photos to your wall with just a few taps.
* FacebookThis is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and it require iOS 5 or above. Do you plan on giving it a whirl?
