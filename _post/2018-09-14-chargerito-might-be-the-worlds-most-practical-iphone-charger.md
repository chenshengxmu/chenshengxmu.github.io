* Our smartphone chargers have become just as important as the devices they charge when it comes to getting through the day, yet carrying a charger around remains wildly inconvenient. Chargerito makes it easy to stay powered up on the go, and it’s currently available for just $29.99. 
* This compact MFi-certified charger is no bigger than the average key fob and features collapsing electrical prongs that don’t snag your clothing. You’ll be able to charge your devices without any added bulk when you travel, and the included clip makes it easy to store the Chargerito right on your key ring.
* Take the hassle out of on-the-go charging with Chargerito for just $29.99.
