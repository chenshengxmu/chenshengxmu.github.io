* While it will likely be the star of the show, the iPad mini isn’t the only new device Apple is going to be unveiling at next week’s event. Word is that the company has a new MacBook and some updated desktops to show off as well.
* And according to a new report, Apple is also going to introduce a retooled third generation iPad next Tuesday. The updated tablet is said to feature the new Lightning connector, global LTE support and other improvements…

* 9to5Mac has the scoop:
* “Apple will announce a refreshed version of its full-sized, 9.7-inch Retina display iPad at its media event October 23rd, according to our sources. These people say that the new version of the iPad will retain the same $499, $599, and $699 WiFi-only price points, and the LTE line will retain the current $629, $729, and $829 pricing. With no price changes or additional storage capacities, we believe that the storage options of 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB will also be retained.”
* As far as features, the site says that the updated tablet is going to get Apple’s new Lightning plug and global LTE support. It also opines that we could see other upgraded internals, and maybe even thinner casing thanks to the changes.
* This isn’t the first time we’ve heard rumors of a retooled third gen iPad either. Back in June, DigiTimes reported that Apple was working on a new version of its current tablet with better heat dissipation and new display technology.
* So as crazy as all of this sounds — Apple refreshing a 6-month-old product — it looks like there’s a good chance we’re going to see Tim Cook and company hoist up a new and improved Retina iPad on stage next week. Interesting.
* What do you think? Is this a good idea, or is Apple shooting itself in the foot?
