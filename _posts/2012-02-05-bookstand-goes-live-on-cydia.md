title: Bookstand Goes Live on Cydia
---
* We previewed Bookstand — a new tweak that allows you to access iBooks content right from iOS 5’s Newsstand — a couple of days ago.
* Now the tweak is available on Cydia for all to enjoy. Be sure to check out our full preview of Bookstand. It can be found on the BigBoss repo for $0.99, and of course it will require iOS 5. Have you tried it yet?
