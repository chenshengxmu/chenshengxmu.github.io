* Even though watchOS 4 supports all watch models, the original device (also called Apple Watch Series 0) featuring Apple’s S1 chip does not support any of the expanded heart rate analytics provided by the new software.
* That’s according to The Verge editor Lauren Goode and other users on social media. Actually, this was first reported by our own Andrew O’Hara 24 hours ago, but not everyone got the memo. At any rate (no pun intended), it’s good that this topic has gotten some new attention.
* On all other Apple Watch models with the exception of Series 0, watchOS 4 enables several new heart-related features, like a real-time heart rate complication, the Current/Resting measurements and averages from your workouts in the Heart app. Optional notifications when your heart rate starts racing after a ten-minute period of inactivity is supported on Series 0.

* watchOS 4, as mentioned, supports all models, even the original Apple Watch model from 2015.
* Also dubbed by the media Apple Watch Series 0 for clarity, it was discontinued when Apple Watch Series 2 was introduced 2016. However, Apple has replaced the original watch model with the Series 1 device featuring exactly the same casing and hardware with the exception of an upgrade S1P chip.
