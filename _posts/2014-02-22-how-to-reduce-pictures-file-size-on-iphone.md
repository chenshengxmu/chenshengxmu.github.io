* Although storage space gets cheaper and cheaper, it seems we always need and want more and more. It’s particularly true if you have a 16GB iPhone. If that’s the case, storage is even more precious to you and you should try to make every MB count.
* Along with music and videos, photos are probably one of the most notorious storage eaters on your iPhone. I know mine is filled with over 20 GB of pictures alone. If you’re in the same situation and you want to save some storage space on your iPhone, one of your options is to decrease the file size of your iPhone pictures.
* As always, there is an app for that. As a matter of fact, there are probably dozens of apps for that, but the one I use is called Photo Compress, an app which only purpose is to lower file size of PNG, JPEG, and GIF images while maintaining the original dimension, unless you choose otherwise. It might not be the prettiest one out there, but it’s the one that I found works best for me.
* In this post, I will show you how to reduce pictures file size on iPhone using Photo Compress in order to regain some storage space on your device…
* Before we get started, it must be noted that while Photo Compress will make photos file size smaller, and can reduce the actual dimensions of the pictures, this is not the app’s primary purpose. If that is what you are trying to do, check out our guide on how to resize an image on your iPhone.
* Step 1: Download Photo Compress from the App Store.
* Step 2: Launch the application and tap the ” + ” icon in the middle of the screen. It will show all the photo albums available on your device. Open an album and select one or more photos that you want to compress, then tap Select.

* Step 3: This is now where you can tweak the level of compression. You have two compression levels available to you: image quality and image size. The more you want to reduce a photo file size, the lower the quality level should be. Likewise, you can choose to reduce the size of images to make their file size smaller.
* For the purposes of this post, I chose image quality at 60% and I also chose to reduce file size by 15%.

* Notice how the app also keeps count of how much space you will save, which can add up pretty quickly if you’re resizing many pictures.
* Step 4: Tap on the Continue button at the bottom, then choose a destination folder where images will be saved, on top of being saved to your Camera Roll. The app will then work its magic to downsize the file size of your photos. The more pictures you have to process, the more time it will take. In my experience, the app was very fast at compressing each image, but of course, your mileage may vary.
* Step 5: Once the app has finished processing the pictures, they will be automatically saved to your Camera Roll and to the album of your choice on your iPhone, so you can find them easily.

* Step 6: You have now the option to delete original photos to save space on your device. Depending on your needs, you may select this option, or tap Finish.
* Shrinking the file size of your photos can save you tons of space of your device. Of course, to save that space, you will have to delete the original photos. And also remember that the more you lower a picture file size, the worse the quality of this image will be.
* Here is the size of these two photos I used, before and after shrinking them:
* In my experience with Photo Compress, I haven’t really noticed an obvious loss of quality, but if you have a good eye for these kind of things, it might make a difference to you.
