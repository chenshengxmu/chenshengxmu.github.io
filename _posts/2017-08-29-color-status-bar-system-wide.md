* It was just over a week ago that we showed you a free jailbreak tweak called Black Status Bar (System Wide) by iOS developer Justin Petkovic. As the name implies, the tweak blackened your Status Bar, an aesthetic that some may prefer over the stock coloring method.
* But for anyone who didn’t like having a black Status Bar all the time, the same developer just launched a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Color Status Bar (System Wide), which lets you choose what color your Status Bar will be.
* As shown above, the tweak works in all your apps where the Status Bar is visible. It also works on the Home screen and on the Lock screen, hence the “System Wide” in the tweak’s title:

* Color Status Bar puts a preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your content:

* Here you can:
* Because the tweak gives you a color picker rather than a color list, you aren’t limited to predefined color options. The customizability should be ideal for anyone using this tweak in tandem with a theme that needs a particular color shade to make things look right.
* A respring is required to save your changes, a Respring button is included for your convenience at the bottom of the preference pane.
* At face value, the tweak is exactly what it looks like: a barebones way of colorizing your Status Bar to something you might find more visually attractive than stock. Obviously, some are fine with the way the Status Bar looks out of the box, so Color Status Bar (System Wide) isn’t for everyone.
* If you want to try the tweak out for yourself, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Color Status Bar (System Wide) works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
