* Last month, popular read-it-later service Pocket took its iOS client global, adding the support of French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish languages. Until then, the app could only display UI elements (not saved content) in English.
* Today the service built on that achievement by adding support for 5 new languages, including both Chinese and Portuguese, via an app update. The release, marked as version 5.2.1, also features better support for Medium and other improvements….
* Here are the release notes for version 5.2.1:
* What’s New in Version 5.2.1 New in 5.2.1: – Pocket is now translated into more languages: Chinese, Dutch, Korean, Polish, and Portuguese – Improved detection for copied links from apps like Medium. – This update also includes a number of bug fixes and improvements. Previously in 5.2: Pocket is now translated into the following languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and Russian.
* Earlier this year, Pocket said that more than 40% of its users already speak a language other than English natively, so this update should bode well with them. It should also appease Medium users, who were having trouble getting Pocket to recognize URLs.
* First debuted in 2007 as ‘Read It Later,’ Pocket has become one of the most popular save-for-later services—and the go-to app for many of us here at iDB. If you’d like to check it out, you can find the app for both the iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free.
