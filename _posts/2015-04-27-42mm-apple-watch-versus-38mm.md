* Apple Watch Sport collection vs Apple Watch Sport, Milanese Loop vs Leather loop. There are lots and lots of choices when it comes to configuring an Apple Watch. There are even two sizes to choose from—38mm and 42mm.
* Choice is good, and there’s certainly a lot of decisions to make when it comes to Apple Watch configuration. But when it comes to size, I would recommend the 42mm. Unless you have really small fingers, and a really small wrist, I think that you should at least try on the 42mm version to test it out.
* Why am I so high on the 42mm Apple Watch? It’s because I’ve tried them both. At first I didn’t think that the difference would be that big of a deal, but after going hands on with both, I’m leaning more heavily towards recommending the larger version

* The bigger touch targets of the 42mm (left) versus the 38mm
* Why do I prefer the 42mm Apple Watch? Due to the larger screen size, the tap targets, or touchable elements on screen are discernibly bigger in some scenarios. On a screen this small, every little bit counts, and although the difference is only 4mm, it makes a difference. You’ll also find that you can fit more text on screen at once, which makes a difference. That means less scrolling and swiping.

* The 42mm (left) places more text on screen
* I guess what I’m trying to say is that I don’t dislike the 38mm due to looks, I just find that the extra real estate makes the 42mm version easier on the eyes in some cases; it’s easier to tap on screen elements.

* The 42mm (left) places more options on screen at once
* If there’s any way that you can get by with the 42mm version, do it. To me, it’s worth the extra $50, and hey, you might even get better battery life according to Apple.
* What do you think? Which watch are you currently rocking? If you’ve yet to get one, which one have you ordered? Sound off down below with your thoughts and opinions.
