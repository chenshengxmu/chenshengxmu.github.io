title: Add Unlimited Icons to Your iPhone Dock With InfiniDock
---
* Forget about the 5-icon dock tweak… InfiniDock is a new application available in Cydia that lets you add an unlimited amount of apps in your dock and make them easily scrollable, just like you scroll through your pages of apps on your springboard.

* InfiniDock was developped by Chpwn and just like the ProSwitcher app, I think this is a simple but powerful tweak that Apple will most likely look at and implement in iPhone OS 4.0.
* I’m glad to see that there are some developers out there like Chpwn. New releases in Cydia have been pretty boring lately. There sure are a bunch of themes and wallpapers, but not so many useful apps.
* I first heard about InfiniDock about a week ago but I didn’t give it a try until I read some of the comments made by a few of you on my post about how many apps you have in your iPhone dock.
* If you haven’t tried it yet, launch Cydia and look for InfiniDock. You can download it from Cydia for $0.99. Well worth the money if you want my opinion.
* Have you tried it yet? What do you think?
