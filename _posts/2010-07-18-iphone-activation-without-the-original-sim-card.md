title: iPhone Activation Without the Original SIM Card

* Sometimes the most simple things are those that work the best. Thatâ€™s exactly what Sherif Hashim illustrates with his little workaround to activate an iPhone without the original SIM card.
* Simply using a $3 PhoneBook card, a SIM card usually used to transfer your contacts from one phone to another, Sherif was able to activate 2 iPhones.
* Check out the video below to see how it works. Warning: sound is terrible!
