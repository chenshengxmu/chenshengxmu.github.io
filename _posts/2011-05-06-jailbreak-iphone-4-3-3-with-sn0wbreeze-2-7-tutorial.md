* Most of you that have upgraded to Apple’s latest firmware, have probably already jailbroken your iDevices using RedSn0w or PwnageTool. If you haven’t yet, you may want to give Sn0wbreeze a try. As we reported earlier, the jailbreak software has joined the iOS 4.3.3 party, courtesy of i0n1c‘s untether.
* Although generally mentioned last when discussing jailbreak options, Sn0wbreeze  is still a good choice for jailbreakers looking to hack their iDevices with ease. It’s especially useful for folks with Verizon iPhones, as the software created by iH8sn0w is currently the only way to jailbreak 4.2.8…
* It’s important to note that Sn0wbreeze 2.7 is only for Windows users. It will jailbreak all recent iDevices on 4.3.3 and Verizon iPhones on 4.2.8, minus the iPad 2. Now that that’s out of the way, let me show you how easy it is to hack your iDevice using Sn0wbreeze.
* Before beginning, make sure you are on the latest version of iTunes and that your iDevice is running iOS 4.3.3 or 4.2.8. Also, if your iPhone is unlocked, or might be in the future, Sn0wBreeze is the way to go as it will preserve your baseband.
* Step 1: Download Sn0wbreeze 2.7 from our downloads section. Also make sure to download the 4.3.3 firmware while you’re there (or 4.2.8 for Verizon iPhone users). I recommend saving everything to your desktop to keep organized.
* Step 2: Launch Sn0wbreeze and click OK through the warning. Locate the firmware you downloaded, and drag it onto the marked area. Click the blue arrow to continue.

* Step 3: Sn0wbreeze will then take a moment to verify the IPSW file you just loaded. Once the firmware is identified, you will be asked to continue.
* Step 4: In this menu, select Expert Mode and then you are welcome to experiment with any of the options in General, Custom packages, or Custom boot logos. Once ready, click Build IPSW. Since this can take a while, you can choose to play a game of PacMan while you wait.

* Step 5: Once complete, Sn0wbreeze will ask you to put your iDevice in DFU mode. Hold Power and Home buttons together for 10 seconds, then release the Power button and continue holding the Home button for another 10 seconds.

* Step 6: If done correctly, you should get a message that says your device is ready to go, and you may now open iTunes and install the custom firmware. Do this by plugging your iDevice into your computer, find it in iTunes, and hold down Shift while clicking the Restore button. This allows you to manually select the firmware that iTunes will use, just find the custom IPSW that Sn0wbreeze just made.
* Once iTunes installs the firmware, your device should restart in a jailbroken state. Any questions?
