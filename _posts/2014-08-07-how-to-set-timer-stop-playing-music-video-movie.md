* Sometimes I like to play calming music or white noise to help me fall asleep. I just select a playlist and play it directly on my iPhone, which is resting next to me on the night stand. The thing is, I don’t want to play music for an extended period of time. I usually need no more than 20-30 minutes to fall asleep.
* There is a subtle feature in the Clock app that lets you set a timer that will stop any media currently playing on your device, whether it is music or video. In this post, we will show you how to set a sleep timer to automatically stop playing music or videos on your iPhone or iPad after a specific time.
* Step 1: Go to the Clock app and select the Timer tab.

* Step 2: Tap on “When Timer Ends.” This is where you would normally select what ringtone you want the timer to use when the time is up.
* Step 3: Scroll all the way to the bottom and select “Stop Playing” and tap “Set” in the upper right corner to confirm.

* If you’re playing music or a movie on your iPhone, the music or the movie will now stop playing when the time is up.
* Be careful though! If in the future you need to set a timer with a ringtone, remember to go back in the Timer settings and change the “Stop Playing” action to an actual ringtone. I can’t tell you how many times I set timers while cooking that never rang because the Timer was still set on Stop Playing.
* The most simple tips are usually the best ones. If you have a tip you’d like to share, you may do in the comment section below, or email tips@iDownloadBlog.com.
