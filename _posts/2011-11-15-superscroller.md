* SuperScroller is a jailbreak tweak from Ryan Petrich that allows you to scroll up or down using an assigned Activator action.
* Many viewers are questioning the tweak’s usefulness on our YouTube channel, but I could certainly see someone using SuperScroller as their preferred method of page navigation; for instance, when reading.
* Check out the video walkthrough inside, and judge for yourselves…
* The tweak is currently in beta, but you can test it out by adding Petrich’s repo to your list of Cydia sources.
* Add the following repo to your list of sources in Cydia: http://rpetri.ch/repo/ and you’ll gain access to the beta version of SuperScroller, among many other tweaks.
* What’s your consensus on SuperScroller?
