* Twelve South designs some of the finest premium accessories built exclusively for Apple devices. The HiRise, its versatile charging stand for the iPhone and iPad, was updated today with refreshed design and some engineering changes to allow for new features.
* The HiRise 2, a new version of the original charging stand, sports refined design, comes in two new colors, has reduced footprint and boasts increased stability with larger iOS devices.
* “Taking cues from our customers’ feedback, the design has changed, but the quality and performance you’ve come to know and love, has not,” notes the firm. As you can see for yourself, its elegant curvature elegantly complements the iPhone 7 design.
* For starters, the HiRise 2 is available in a new black colorway that looks great with Apple’s new matte and glossy black iPhone 7 finishes, as well as in snow white which Twelve South says seamlessly fits in any home or office décor.

* It’s got one-third smaller footprint than its predecessor to save even more space on your bedside or desk. And because it’s now twice as heavy, it provides added stability with larger devices like iPads (although still not recommended for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro).
* Due to its tilted angle, the HiRise 2 lets you use your iOS device hands-free while it’s charging, watch movies, engage in FaceTime video calls, present your latest work or just use it as a second-screen for keeping an eye on your Twitter feed, emails and more.
* “Unlike many other stands, ours does not block or muffle the sound coming out of your iPhone 7 stereo speakers,” reads the press release.
* Another productivity-boosting idea: perch your iPad atop the stand to raise its screen to a more comfortable height, then use the tablet as an external display for your Mac with a little help from the Duet Display app.

* “You can also park HiRise near your favorite Bluetooth speaker to stream hours of music knowing your iPhone will be charged when you’re ready to go,” says Twelve South.
* The stand comes with the included height clips and features rear support that slides back and forth allowing you to adjust both its height and depth to fit your device model or accommodate devices in protective cases, minimal shells or no case at all.
* Lastly, its versatile, smart design allows the HiRise 2 to charge pretty much any Lightning-equipped device, including the Siri Remote, Apple’s new wireless AirPods earphones, Magic accessories such as the Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Keyboard, and most third-party game controllers for that matter.

* Plus, it with most iPhone cases so you won’t need to remove your case in order to use your iPhone with the HiRise 2, courtesy of the included cord clips that ensure that even cases with deeply recessed ports fit while docked and charging.
* The standard-edition $39.99 HiRise 2 is available in Silver, Technical Black and Matte White to complement the finish of your iPhone and iPad.
