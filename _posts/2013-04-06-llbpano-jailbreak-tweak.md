title: Take better low-light panoramic pictures with LLBPano

* I’m a big fan of the Panorama capture feature that was added in iOS 6. I’d like to be able to use it while holding my iPhone in landscape mode, but other than that I think Apple did a great job with it.
* It doesn’t always work very well in low-light conditions though. And that’s where the jailbreak tweak LLBPano comes in. It enables Low-light mode on the iPhone 5 when taking panoramic photos…
* There’s not much to the tweak itself. There’s no Home screen icon or options to configure. Once you install it from Cydia, you’ll just have to pop into your Settings app and make sure it’s enabled.
* Once enabled, LLBPano will automatically activate your iPhone’s Low-light mode—a feature Apple added to the iPhone 5 to improve the handset’s ability to take photographs in low-light conditions.
* Unfortunately, this means that the tweak is only available for the iPhone 5. Well that and the new iPod touch. The dev says that if 5th gen iPod touch users install the LLBiPT5 tweak, LLBPano should work.
* That makes for a limited audience—iPhone 5 or 5th gen iPod touch users that want to take panoramic photos in low-light conditions—but I have to say, it does make a difference. Just look at the above photo.
* So as long as you meet this criteria, the tweak is very much worth checking out. You can find LLBPano in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for free.
