* Apple is said to have developed a next-generation Touch ID sensor where an OLED display of the device doubles as a fingerprint sensor. This should enable users to rest their finger on the display to authenticate themselves.
* According to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report, citing sources from Apple’s chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Apple has managed to develop an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first called it in January.
* He said because Touch ID’s capacitive sensor does not work through the display’s cover glass, Apple could go with an optical sensor which doesn’t require physical contact with a user’s finger.
* Other iPhone 8 features, according to a TSMC source, include no physical Home button, the screen ratio of 18.5:9 instead of the previous 16:9 and invisible infrared image sensors to enhance camera functionality and enable augmented reality features.
* Apple is understood to have been plagued with yield issues regarding the new optical fingerprint sensor. It’s unclear if the company has managed to resolve those technical issues.
