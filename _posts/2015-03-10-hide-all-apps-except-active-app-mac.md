* I’m pretty messy when it comes to working on my Mac. I multitask a lot, and as such, I always have a gazillion windows open at any given time. But sometimes I need to focus, and when those times come, I like to get rid of every potential distraction and hone in on a specific app. macOS contains a very handy shortcut that allows you to do just that.
* To hide every other app except for the app that you’re currently working on, do the following:
* Step 1: Open the app that you wish to keep open.
* Step 2: Click the name of the app in the menu bar.
* Step 3: Click Hide Others.
* You can also use a simple keyboard shortcut: Option (⌥)+Command (⌘)+H and that will hide all other applications as well.
* I seriously use this handy shortcut every single day that I use my Mac. As someone who always has a ton of different windows open, I couldn’t live without this shortcut.
* What do you think? Do you often hide other apps so that you can focus on a particular task? Sound off down below with your thoughts and use-cases.
