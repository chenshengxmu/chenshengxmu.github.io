* Since iOS 6 went live yesterday morning, there has been a lot of commotion regarding Apple’s new Maps application. As most of you know, Apple replaced Google’s mapping software with its own in-house solution this year.
* And people hate it. Reports over the last 24 hours have berated the app for not having transit information, being inaccurate, and just flat out not being as good as its predecessor. Well, Apple responded to the criticism this afternoon…
* AllThingsD has the statement:
* “Customers around the world are upgrading to iOS 6 with over 200 new features including Apple Maps, our first map service. We are excited to offer this service with innovative new features like Flyover, turn by turn navigation, and Siri integration. We launched this new map service knowing it is a major initiative and that we are just getting started with it. Maps is a cloud-based solution and the more people use it, the better it will get. We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better.”
* Admittedly, the Maps app seems a bit unpolished for a public release. But if what Apple says is true, we should start noticing improvements in the Maps app very soon. And since the media has given this issue so much attention, I’d bet on it.
* But the question still remains, will we see a standalone Google Maps application for iOS anytime soon? It’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
* What do you make of the whole situation?
