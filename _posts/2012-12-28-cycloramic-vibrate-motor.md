* Up until now, if you wanted to shoot 360-degree video with your iPhone, you’d either need a snap-on accessory, like the GoPano, or a pair of steady hands and some patience. But a clever new app is looking to change that.
* Introducing Cycloramic, an iPhone app that uses the handset’s built-in vibrate motor to spin it around in a circle, allowing you to capture 360-degree video, completely hands free. Hard to believe? Check out the video demo…
* The concept here is pretty simple. After loading up the app on your iPhone, you must balance the handset upright on a flat surface — as you can imagine, it has to be really flat for this to work — and press the “GO” button.
* Cycloramic works its magic by making the phone vibrate at just the right frequencies to force it into a steady a twirl. And the handset will continue to spin in a circle, while recording video, until you press the “STOP” button.
* Your phone must be set to vibrate, on both Silent and Ring profiles, for the app to function properly. And while the app is compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, they don’t tend to spin as well as the iPhone 5 due to their sizes.
* If you want to check out Cycloramic for yourself, you can find it in the App Store for $0.99.
* What do you think of Cycloramic? Ingenious idea, or just a gimmick?
