* Apple is planning an event for Wednesday, September 9 to announce new products, according to BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski. The well-connected reporter is hearing that the company will use the stage to unveil new iPhones, iPads and Apple TV.
* In line with previous rumors, Paczkowski says the new iPhones—which the press has been referring to as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus—will feature pressure-sensitive Force Touch displays, improved camera systems and significantly faster processors.
* Surprisingly, he believes Apple is going to show off new tablets at the event as well—something it typically reserves for a separate event in October. He’s expecting new iPad Air and mini models, and says that the rumored 12.9-inch Pro is a “wildcard.”
* Finally, Paczkowski reports that a new Apple TV will also make an appearance on September 9th. Previous reports have said that the device will be slimmer and more powerful, with support for native apps and games and redesigned touchpad remote.
* If the report holds true, we would expect the new iPhones to become available for purchase later in the month—possibly Friday, September 18, like they did last year. It seems likely the new iPads and Apple TV would launch during this timeframe as well.
