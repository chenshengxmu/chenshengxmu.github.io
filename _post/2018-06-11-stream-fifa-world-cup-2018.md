* The 2018 FIFA World Cup is set to begin on Thursday, June 14th with the opening game opposing the host country Russia to Saudi Arabia. The competition will see 32 teams fight for the most prestigious sport title over the course of an entire month. If you aren’t sure how to follow the competition, we will show you several ways to stream the FIFA World Cup on iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
* To make sure you don’t miss a game, add the 2018 World Cup schedule to your calendar!
* If you have an active cable subscription in the US (or if you know someone willing to share their username and password to their cable account), there are a few ways you can stream games of the World Cup on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV.
* In the US, FOX holds rights to the games and will be broadcasting them either on FOX or FOX Sports 1. Both channels are typically available on a basic plan.
* If you have access to cable, you can watch the games on the FOX Sports, and FOX Sports GO apps on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
* If you don’t have a cable subscription (or don’t know a Good Samaritan), you might consider signing up for DIRECTV NOW or Sling TV. These two TV streaming services offer different packages that are all contract-free. That means, you can sign up for a month, and cancel once the World Cup is over.
* If you opt for a temporary DIRECTV NOW or Sling TV subscription, make sure the package you get does include FOX and FOX Sports 1.
* After signing up, you can use the DIRECTV NOW and Sling TV apps for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV to stream the games.
* DIRECTV NOW is currently running an interesting promo where you can get a free Apple TV 4K if you sign up and prepay for three months of the service. That pretty much covers the cost of the Apple TV itself.
* Note that if you don’t live in the US, you can still sign up for these two services, however, you will have to do so using a VPN in order to spoof your location and make it look like you are in the US. More on that below…
* Depending on where you are located in the world, you might be able to watch some or all of the games for free as many sites offer free streaming. You just have to be in the right location.
* For example, here are various sites or apps that allow you to watch games of the World Cup for free, based on these specific locations:
* Australia: Go to The World Game website to watch all the games of the Socceroos, a daily “game of the day,” two quarter-finals, one semi-final, and the final.
* France: Download the free Get TV en Direct app to watch all the games from the French team on TF1. It’s completely free and no registration is required.
* UK: Go to https://tvplayer.com/ to watch games on BBC and ITV channels. This is free but requires you to register for the service). Between them, BBC and ITV will cover all the games of the World Cup.
* Please share with us in the comments section what the best way of legally streaming the World Cup in your country is, and I will add to this list.
* The sites and apps mentioned above only work if you are physically located in their respective country, but you can easily bypass this with a VPN. There are tons of VPNs available out there, but some of the best VPNs we recommend are Private Internet Access and NordVPN. They are not free but they offer unlimited data at a very fair price.
* Using a VPN on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you will be able to spoof your location and pretend you are in a country where you can stream the games for free.
* As mentioned above, you can also sign up for either DIRECTV NOW or Sling TV using a VPN.
* Wondering what TV channels has broadcasting rights to the World Cup in your country? Wikipedia has a great summary of all official 2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasters broken down per country.
* Make sure to check out this web page to find out what’s the best official way to watch the World Cup in your country.
* With a little community effort, we can create a very comprehensive list of legal resources for streaming the World Cup.
* If you know of apps or websites that are available in your country to stream the FIFA World Cup, please feel free to share links and I will add them to the list above.
