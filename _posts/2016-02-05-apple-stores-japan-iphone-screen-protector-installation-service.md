* As first noted by MacOtakara, employees of Apple Stores in Japan have now received specialized Belkin tools to install screen protectors on iPhones in-store, though it’s unclear if this iPhone screen protector installation service might soon expand to other Apple Stores around the world.
* Using Belkin’s TrueClear Pro device, store employees are able to apply a screen protector in a straightforward and easy manner. Prices range from 2,180 yen to 4,280 yen, depending on material and device size, which works out to about $19 to $37.
* According to Belkin’s FAQ document for the TrueClear Pro, a screen protector cannot be installed on a cracked or damaged iPhone screen. Should a customer dislike the screen protector application, a store employee will offer to reapply it at no additional charge.
* Currently, all iPhone models from the iPhone 4 onward are supported by the TrueClear Pro, with the exception of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

* For what it’s worth, Apple did confirm that company-approved screen overlays work with the 3D Touch feature on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
