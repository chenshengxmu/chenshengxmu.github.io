* Despite worries Apple may be withholding pre-order figures on its new iPhones due to lower demand, one Wall Street observer says the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c could be a new sales record, topping last year’s iPhone 5 launch.
* According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple probably will ship 6 to 8 million of the iPhones over the weekend, topping the iPhone 5 launch of 5 million units. The iPhone 5c will account for the majority of new iPhones sold between Friday and Monday…
* As for sales figures, Apple likely will follow a pattern set in 2012 with the fourth-gen iPad and iPad mini: announcing combined numbers for the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Kuo told investors Wednesday (via AppleInsider).
* The analyst expects the iPhone 5s will account for 35 to 40 percent of weekend sales, with the iPhone 5c providing 55 to 65 percent of purchases.
* By comparison, Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster uses a more conservative model of 5 to 6 million handsets sold. Those numbers are based on initial in-store sales of the iPhone 5.

* On the question of why the iPhone 5c costs more than expected, Kuo believes the smartphone wasn’t meant to be a “low-cost” iPhone, but a way to extend the lifespan of the iPhone 5.
* Since the screen size of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c is the same, a low-priced model might cannibalize sales of the more expensive iPhone 5s, he writes. Those seeking a real low-cost iPhone may have to wait until 2014, when a new handset is unveiled.
* China Mobile could spur demand for the iPhone 5c. According to Kuo, the world’s largest carrier may use the 5c to attract users of its new TDD-LTE network.
* The iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c officially go on sale 8 a.m. Friday.
