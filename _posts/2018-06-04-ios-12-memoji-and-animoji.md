* For devices that support it, iOS 12 will include new Animoji features and Memoji, a customizable Animoji character similar to Bitmoji and Nintendo Mii. Among the new Animoji features are tongue detection, which will allow you to make the tongues of your Animoji characters stick their tongues out, as well as new characters like Ghost, Koala, Tiger and T-Rex.
* The more interesting revelation, however, is the new Memoji feature. Like the aforementioned Bitmoji, Memoji allows you to customize your own Animoji character by choosing face appear, hair color, and various accessories. And of course, as with regular Animoji, the personalized character will reflect your facial movements—it’s like having your own cartoon!

* Here’s the official pitch from Apple’s website:
* New features make communicating with friends and family from iPhone X more expressive with new Animoji and personalized Memoji characters that are customizable and fun. Create beautifully designed Memoji right within Messages by choosing from a set of inclusive and diverse characteristics to form a unique personality. The existing set of Animoji also expands with ghost, koala, tiger and T. rex.
* All Animoji and Memoji now feature winks and tongue detection to capture even more expressions. New camera effects bring Animoji, Filters, Text and Stickers to Messages and FaceTime. Filters like comic book and watercolor add personality to photos and videos, new labels and shapes let users add captions and titles to highlight parts of an image, and stickers can be placed using iMessage sticker pack
* We are currently installing the iOS 12 beta, so be sure to check back for more hands-on coverage on the new Animoji and Memoji features.
