* Apple has named Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage it’s App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the popular game for both iPhone and iPad for free—a decent savings of $1.
* For those who aren’t familiar with the game, it was created by Angry Birds hit-maker Rovio Entertainment and Nitrome. It’s essentially a Cut The Rope-style physics-based puzzler, which has you rescuing vikings from blocks of ice.

* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Rescue frozen Vikings and collect treasure in Nitrome’s ingenious physics-based puzzler. Based around a few easy-to-learn mechanics, Icebreaker’s creative scenarios are a brain-teasing delight, while the game’s oddball humor and adorable visuals make it a fun diversion for any player.
* The game features 140 levels in three different lands, each filled with vikings, trolls, deadly theme park rides and of course, plenty of ice. There are also loads of side quests, unlockable secrets, and epic boss battles at major checkpoints.
* Here’s a video showing gameplay:
* If you want to check it out, you can find Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage in the App Store for free (until next Thursday). It’s worth noting that there are several in-app purchases available, so be careful what you tap on.
