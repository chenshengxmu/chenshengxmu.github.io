* iPhones for everyone! Yesterday, we told you about the report that Sprint would offer the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 to its customer base this Fall, and now a new rumor has surfaced that T-Mobile will also carry the iPhone 5 when it launches in the coming months.
* The new device from Apple will allegedly run on T-Mobile’s 3G network, and the iPhone 5 is expected to be a global phone capable of running on both CDMA and GSM networks…
* This T-Mobile rumor comes from Mactrast. The site claims that an inside source at T-Mobile has said that the company will offer the iPhone 5 alongside the three other major US carriers in early to mid October.
* “The informant, who requested to remain anonymous, went on to claim that the iPhone 5 would also operate at 3G speeds on T-Mobile US network. Current unlocked iPhone 4 units can only operate at at 2G “edge” speeds on T-Mobile’s network, and lack certain network-dependent features, such as Visual Voicemail.
* Further elaborating on the matter, the informant suggested that T-Mobile USA expects the iPhone 5 to launch sometime in early to mid October, which corresponds nicely with current speculation. He also expects the iPhone 5 to make a significant financial difference to T-Mobile. Our source was quoted as saying the following:
* “We expect the addition of the iPhone, and the iPhone 5′s ability to run on our 3G network to make a significant financial difference for T-Mobile.”
* A merger between AT&T and T-Mobile is currently under review by the FCC, and it’s expected that T-Mobile will be absorbed into AT&T in the next couple years. This rumor of T-Mobile carrying the iPhone 5 makes sense, but it should be taken with a grain of salt.
* Apple clearly wants to get its products in the hands of as many people as possible, and T-Mobile’s customer base has been left out in the cold since 2007. Unlocked iPhone users are able to operate on T-Mobile’s EDGE network, but baseband conflicts currently prevent the use of 3G.
* The iPhone 5 will most likely be a dual-baseband device, and it’s arrival on Sprint and T-Mobile would be a welcomed addition. T-Mobile isn’t exactly around to stay, but for now, there’s no reason that the iPhone 5 couldn’t be available on the network this Fall.
* Will the iPhone 5’s arrival on T-Mobile affect your buying decision this Fall? What about Sprint?
