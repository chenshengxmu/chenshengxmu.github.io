* Not to be outdone by Australia’s Telstra and Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, British telecommunications operator EE (formerly Everything Everywhere) confirmed that it, too, would soon be treating its customers to six free months of music-streaming via Apple Music and Beats 1 Radio.
* To promote this offer, the carrier put together a multi-million pound ad campaign featuring actor Kevin Bacon and pop singer Britney Spears.
* ”Six free months of Apple Music—coming soon to new and upgrading customers,” reads a note on the carrier’s website. The promotion goes live on September 1.
* New and upgrading pay monthly iOS and Android customers in the United Kingdom shall receive six months of Apple Music free of charge. After the six months of free Apple Music subscriptions have expired, the carrier will automatically charge customers £9.99 a month unless they cancel the recurring monthly subscription before their trial ends.
* Here’s the commercial (the video may be unavailable in some countries).
* To take advantage of the offer, customers must add it to their account within 30 days of joining EE or upgrading their service. This marks the first time that a UK operator has offered Apple Music to its customer base. For those wondering, EE’s 4G network blankets more than two-thirds of the UK.
* It appears these kinds of promotions are becoming commonplace.
* German’s Deutsche Telekom is set to officially announce its own six free months of Apple Music deal at IDF in September.
* Australia’s biggest carrier Telstra just started treating its users to six months of free Apple Music subscriptions on top of Apple’s three-month free trial, while permitting data-free streaming of Apple Music songs and albums à la T-Mobile’s Binge On.
