* The full AppleCare+ extended warranty pricing for the Apple Watch is now live on the Online Apple Store. All Watch models include Apple’s standard 1-year warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary support, but now these extended warranty plans are optionally available.
* For the entry-level aluminum Apple Watch Sport, the AppleCare+ coverage costs $49. The mid-tier stainless steel Apple Watch models command a cost of $69 for the extended AppleCare+ coverage, while owners of the gold Edition models will need to fork out a whopping $1,500.
* But that’s not all.
* AppleCare+ for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models extend your coverage to two years from the original purchase date of your device. In the case of  the Apple Watch Edition, AppleCare+ extends your coverage to three years from the original purchase date.

* All extended coverage plans includes up to two incidents of accidental damage from handling and cover the battery, the included magnetic charging cable and power adapter. More importunely, each hardware incident is subject to a service fee on top of the basic plan cost.
* For the Apple Watch Sport models, each hardware incident will set you back an additional $69, or $79 in the case of the pricier Apple Watch stainless steel models. As for the Apple Watch Edition, hardware incidents are subject to the service fee of an eye-watering $1,000 each.

* In addition to the above, AppleCare+ plans for all Watches include expert telephone technical support for questions related to Apple Watch, Watch OS and Apple-branded Watch apps, including using Watch OS, connecting to an iPhone (including iOS and the Apple Watch app) and any questions you may have about Apple-branded Watch apps.

* You can get an AppleCare+ plan at the time of Watch purchase or buy it within 60 days of your device purchase. Last but not least, folks who don’t already have AppleCare+ for their iPhone can get coverage for both the Watch and the phone for up to two years from their Watch purchase date.

* AppleCare+ for Apple Watch models and the iPhone is only available when you purchase a new Apple Watch model from an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store in the United States.
* “Your iPhone must be undamaged and less than six months old to be eligible for coverage,” writes Apple. Additional terms and conditions are available here.
* These combo plans are available at a combined price of $149 (Apple Watch Sport and iPhone), $169 (Apple Watch and iPhone) and $1,600 (Apple Watch Edition and iPhone).
* While combo plans cover iPhones that are up to six months old, standard AppleCare+ coverage for the iPhone must be purchased within 60 days of buying a iPhone.
