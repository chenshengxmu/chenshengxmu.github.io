* The iOS 7 GM release includes a bunch of new dynamic and static wallpaper for users to enjoy, and we’ve taken the liberty to showcase all of them in a hands-on video just for you. The final version of iOS 7 includes quite a few brand new wallpapers, and many of them are really well done. Have a look past the fold to check them out for yourself…
* Which wallpaper happens to be your favorite? Personally? I’m digging the gray dynamic wallpaper. It’ll look great on my Space Gray iPhone 5S.
