* So we’ve known that the operating system powering Microsoft’s Surface tablet along with bundled apps eats up a lot of storage space. Earlier today, the software giant published an interesting support doc clarifying the exact storage requirements. Turns out out that a 32GB Surface RT leaves users with only sixteen gigabytes of usable storage space because the Surface OS and preloaded Office apps consume a whopping 16 gigs. I’m using the whopping adjective here because the Surface after all is a mobile device, not a full-blown desktop.
* This is hardly a surprise to us geeks who’ve grown accustomed to Redmond’ resource-taxing desktop software but as it is, the situation inevitably begs the question of the gizmo’s prospect with average Joes who’ve seen the iPad and expect a 32GB tablet to at least provide 30 gigs of usable storage space. Also, we’ve got a nice new video below the fold highlighting the Touch and Type Covers for Surface…
* The Surface FAQ details the amount of storage at customers’ disposal out of the box:
* • the 32 GB version has approximately 16 GB free hard disk space • the 64 GB version has approximately 46 GB free hard disk space
* The Surface with Windows RT comes with either 32 or 64 gigs of internal storage space.
* “However, not all of this space is available for your music, photos, videos, and other content”, the FAQ clarifies.
* Some of the Surface disk space is used by built-in apps and by the Windows features that can help you protect and recover the stuff you store on your Surface.
* That’s hardly a comforting thought to less than eagle-eyed buyers who could be in for an unpleasant surprise upon discovering that their brand spanking new tablet provides half the advertised storage space for their stuff.
* The following, on the other hand, is a comforting thought: the Surface RT accepts microSD, microSDHC or microSDXC memory cards for up to 64 gigs of additional storage as well as USB thumb drives though – as is the case with Android devices – this external storage is for your music, documents, videos and pictures but not apps.

* Another option: Microsoft’s pretty cool SkyDrive online storage (that, too, could use some simplification).
* Here’s the video highlighting the Touch and Type Covers for the Surface.
* Microsoft also educates us on Surface ports in another clip.
* My favorite: Jeff’s size and dimensions comparison between the Surface and the iPad.
* Say what you will about Microsoft, but they nailed the covers, didn’t they?
