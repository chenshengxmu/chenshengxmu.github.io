* We know the iPhone 6 is coming at some point this Fall and if history is anything to go by, there should be a media event in or around mid-September. No reputable publication has pinpointed the exact timeframe for such a high-profile event, however. That is, until this morning.
* Enter well-informed John Paczkowski of Re/code, who just reported that Apple has scheduled an iPhone-focused event on Tuesday, September 9, so better mark your calendar accordingly…
* “Apple has scheduled a big media event for Tuesday, September 9,” reads a short report filed today.
* As with September events past, the focal point of this one is to be Apple’s next-generation iPhones, which are expected to feature larger displays of 4.7 and 5.5 inches and run speedy new A8 processors.
* Needless to say, Apple declined comment.
* Should Tim Cook & Co. unveil the iPhone 6 on September 9, expect the device to start selling in the United States and across key markets around the world a week or two later.
* Apple usually rolls out major new products to stores on Fridays, so the iPhone 6 release party should be either on September 19 or September 26, methinks.
* And if I were to play Kremlinologist, I’d point out that September’s birthstone is the sapphire.
* The press has yet to receive Apple’s media invites for the event. Keep in mind that Re/code, a fairly new technology-focused website run by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, who are former WSJ star reporters and columnists, has reliable, plugged-in sources so this definitely is not yet another iPhone 6 rumor to ignore.
* Apple is widely expected to unveil both 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 devices simultaneously, despite previous reports claiming a delay for the bigger handset amid production issues. As for new iPads, we expect another media event in October, just like last year.
* As for other rumored products such as the iWatch, several conflicting rumors claimed that the health/fitness device could see a formal introduction toward the end of this year, or in early-2015.

* Apple’s arch-rival Samsung will be holding its own media event on September 3 at the IFA show in Berlin, Germany. The South Korean conglomerate is said to be rushing out its fourth-generation Galaxy Note phablet in an attempt to steal Apple’s thunder.
* I think it’s perfectly agreeable that Apple’s double-iPhone launch on September 9 is bound to suck out all the air out of the technology news cycle. Since the original iPhone’s inception, Apple has stubbornly refused to enter the so-called phablet market.
* The rumored 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will change that.
* And as Samsung has shipped tens of millions of phablet-class devices, it’s perfectly the company fears the effect the iPhone 6 is bound to have on its sales.

* It’s also totally safe to assume that a significant portion of former Apple users who switched to Samsung (because the iPhone maker did not have what they wanted at the time) will consider switching back to Apple as soon as the iPhone 6 becomes official.
* No other source has corroborated the Re/code story at the time of this writing, but I’ll be making sure to update the article as new information becomes available.
* My wallet is ready for the iPhone 6.
* And yours?
