* It was not long ago that people dreamed of providing a PC for every child on the planet. Well, the vision needs to be updated. Tablets – particularly  those in the iPad mini size range – are outselling laptops now and soon will overtake all PCs, research firm IDC reported Tuesday.
* Some 229.3 million tablets are expected to ship this year for a 58.7 percent growth rate, compared to 2012. By contrast, PC shipments are down for the second year in a row, dropping 7.8 percent in 2013, the company announced.
* The key takeaways: tablets are becoming smaller and cheaper, while at the same time being increasingly able to accomplish tasks once done by PCs…
* Slumping shipments of laptops and PCs can no longer be blamed solely on a depressed worldwide economy, IDC announced. Instead, a paradigm shift is underway – one that doesn’t include PCs and laptops for many consumers.

* “What started as a sign of tough economic times has quickly shifted to a change in the global computing paradigm with mobile being the primary benefactor,” said Ryan Reith, program manager for IDC.
* The passage by tablets of both laptops and PCs marks a “significant change in consumer attitudes about compute devices and the applications and ecosystems that power them.”

* Although PCs will maintain an “important role” for business users, for consumers “a tablet is a simple and elegant solution for core use cases that were previously addressed by the PC,” Reith said.
* Echoing his point, IDC’s Loren Loverde noted:
* Many users are realizing that everyday computing, such as accessing the Web, connecting to social media, sending emails, as well as using a variety of apps, doesn’t require a lot of computing power or local storage.
* While PC prices have fallen to $635, the cost is still almost double the $381 you’re expected to pay for a tablet in 2013.

* Among tablets, small is big.
* According to IDC, market share for tablet below eight inches – such as the iPad mini – is expected to grow from 55 percent of the market now to 57 percent by 2017.

* Meanwhile, the researchers forecast shipments of tablets with screens between eight and eleven inches will drop precipitously: from 73 percent of the market in 2011 to 37 percent in 2017.
* Just as Apple introduced the Mac into schools, it is having equal success unveiling the iPad as an educational tool, per IDC researcher Jitesh Ubrani said:
* These devices are learning companions, and as tablet prices continue to drop, the dream of having a PC for every child gets replaced with the reality that we can actually provide a tablet for every child.
* And if you believe the rumor-mill, Apple could be developing a 12.9-inch ‘iPad maxi’ model to target educational market and digital textbooks.
* The story also asserts Apple has been working with component suppliers on a new display technology for classroom use, one with less glare versus the traditional LCD IPS tech currently utilized on iPads and iPhones.
