* Two weeks following the release of the third beta of iOS 10, watchOS 3, tvOS 10 and macOS Sierra, Apple on Monday issued iOS 10 beta 4, macOS Sierra beta 4, watchOS 3 beta 4 and tvOS 10 beta 4 to members of the Apple Developer Program. The public beta of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra matching the latest developer-only releases should be released tomorrow to public beta testers enrolled with the Apple Beta Software Program.
* NOTE: Wallpapers seen on the iOS 10 Lock screen screenshots top of post can be downloaded from our Wallpapers of the Week series.
* Here’s a summary of OS updates Apple released today:
* Release notes for iOS 10 beta 4, macOS Sierra beta 4, watchOS 3 beta 4, tvOS 10 beta 4 and Xcode 8 beta 4 are available from Apple to those who have access to Dev Center.
* The latest betas can be installed on developer-only devices with a prior beta, over the air, using the Software Update mechanism. If a proper Apple-provided configuration profile has been installed on the device, the update prompt should appear automatically.
