* Apple introduced a new iPad mini and full-sized iPad yesterday to a packed audience at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center. The former is now sporting a crisp Retina display, and the latter has been redesigned as the ‘iPad Air.’
* The company has already posted an ad for the Air on its YouTube channel, showing various settings the tablet is used in with a voiceover talking about its versatility. And if you thought the voice sounded familiar, you were right…
* A few folks noted that the man speaking in the Air commercial sounds a bit like actor Bryan Cranston, who just wrapped up the hit TV show Breaking Bad. And as it turns out it is, as confirmed by Mashable and several other outlets.

* Of course Apple has used celebrities in a number of previous product ads—remember the celebrity-laden iPhone 4s ‘Siri’ campaign?—and has frequently used them for voiceovers: actors Jeff Daniels and Kiefer Sutherland come to mind.
* Still, it’s an interesting tidbit, especially considering how big Bryan Cranston is right now.
* The ad itself is great, delivering a powerful message about the new version of one of Apple’s most popular products. And I like how they used Cranston—the voiceover is a lot more subtle, less gaudy than typical celebrity endorsements.
* What do you think?
