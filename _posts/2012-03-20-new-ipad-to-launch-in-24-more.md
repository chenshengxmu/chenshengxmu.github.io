* It’s no secret that Apple’s new tablet has been an overwhelming success thus far. The company announced yesterday that it sold more than three million iPads during its opening weekend — a new record for tablet sales.
* But perhaps even more impressive is the amount of iPads that are still available. Retailers still have tons of the tablets on hand, and Apple is looking to launch the new iPad in 24 more countries this Friday…
* The latest iPad is already available in 12 countries, including the US, Canada and France. And appears that Apple is looking to make that 36 by week’s end. Starting at 8:00 am local time on Friday morning, the tablet will become available in:
* Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macau, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
* Folks in these countries will be able to find the new iPad online, in Apple’s retail stores, and in select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* This is the fastest Apple has ever rolled out a new product internationally, which really speaks to its strong supply chain presence. Last year, iPad 2 supply was far more scarce, and it took Apple several months to catch up to consumer demand.
