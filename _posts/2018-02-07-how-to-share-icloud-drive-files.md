* You can share iCloud Drive files with other people to either give them basic access to the document, or to allow them to collaborate and edit the document. This sharing can be initiated via your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or even from iCloud.com using any web browser.
* In this tutorial, we will learn how to share iCloud Drive files and documents, how to edit permissions for shared files, and how to revoke access to share documents. We will look at how to do all of that on iOS, Mac, and from iCloud.com.
* One of the advantages of being an Apple user when using iCloud Drive file sharing is that you can move from one platform to another seamlessly. For instance, you can start sharing a document from your iPhone, edit the file permissions later on from a Mac, and revoke access to the file from iCloud.com. Each change made on one platform automatically carries over to the others.
* Also worth noting is that the person you share the file with will have to have an Apple ID. If the person is opening the file on iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the file will be downloaded locally in their iCloud Drive. If the person is accessing the file from the web, they will first have to login to iCloud.com to retrieve the file
* The following screenshots were taken on an iPhone, but the steps are identical on iPad.
* 1) Look for the document you want to share in the iCloud Drive app on your iPhone or iPad.
* 2) Tap the Select button, then tap on the document you want to share to select it.

* 3) Tap on the arrow-up icon, then select Add People from the sharing options.
* 4) Choose how you want to share this document. For this tutorial, we will share the document by email. You can also adjust the Share Options, aka permissions, during this step, but we will look more into this below.

* 5) Fill in the email address of the recipient, and tap Send. The person you are sharing this will receive a link from which they can access the document.
* 6) If you need to share with more people at some point, simply follow steps 1 to 3 above, then select Add People.
* By default, iCloud Drive documents are set to be accessed by only people you invite, and these people can also make changes to the documents. You can change these permissions.
* 1) Follow steps 1 to 3 from the section above. You will see people you are sharing the document with. From there you can change permissions for each individual, or for everyone you’re sharing with.
* 2) To change permissions for one individual, select this person and select either View only or Can make changes.

* By default, your Mac will make any document you share via iCloud Drive accessible to only people you invite, and these people can also make changes to the documents. You can edit this either before sharing the document, or after the document has been shared.

* 2) Click on the Share icon, or right-click on the file and select Show People.
