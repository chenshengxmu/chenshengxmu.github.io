* That wasn’t much of a big prediction, but I was right when I said we’d see a new verison of iTunes. Today Steve Jobs announced the release of iTunes 10, which not only comes with a new logo, but also with new features… The most exciting new feature coming with iTunes 10 is Ping, some sort of social music discovery, or a mix of Twitter and Facebook for iTunes, as Steve Jobs puts it.
* You can follow and be followed by friends, you can follow artists, you can post your thoughts and opinions, find concert information, and more…
* Each of the 160 million iTunes users in the world get access to Ping, so will every iPhone and iPod Touch users as Ping comes with the iTunes app.
* I believe Apple set the bar very high with this. Not only will Ping be great for iTunes users, but it will most importantly boost iTunes sales tremendously.
* You can download the new iTunes 10 today from Apple’s website. If you’re jailbroken, I suggest you hold on on the update as it might break your jailbreak/unlock ability.
