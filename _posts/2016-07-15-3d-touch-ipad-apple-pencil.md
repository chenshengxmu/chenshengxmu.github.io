* Many people are disappointed that the latest iPads lack 3D Touch-capable screens although it’s anyone’s guess whether or not 3D Touch would make sense on tablet-sized screens. Well, iOS 10 beta 2 apparently has 3D Touch-like functionality on the iPad thanks to the Apple Pencil, which has been discovered to support deep presses.
* Using an Apple Pencil, it’s possible to do things like clear all notifications with a deep press on the latest beta of iOS 10. Check out our video showing the feature in action and, as usually, let us know what you guys think of this.
* My colleague Andrew has put together a nice little video showing off clearing all notifications by deep-pressing the X icon in the Notification Center on iOS 10 beta 2.
* It’s unclear whether this is a 3D Touch-like feature, or just a long press that could be replicated with a finger. 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s requires special hardware in the form of an array of 96 pressure-sensing sensors between the display and the backlight so, at best, this is most likely 3D Touch-like functionality.
* Andrew confirms that deep presses actually don’t work with a finger like they do when you use an Apple Pencil. “It is definitely pressure sensitive because I can press harder or softer to make the animation go up and down,” he said.
* For what it’s worth, hard-pressing with an Apple Pencil on the Home screen app icons or notifications on the Lock screen currently does nothing on iOS 10 beta 2.
* What do you think of this cool finding? Would replicating 3D Touch via the Apple Pencil make sense to iPad owners, do you think?
* Sound off in the comments below.
