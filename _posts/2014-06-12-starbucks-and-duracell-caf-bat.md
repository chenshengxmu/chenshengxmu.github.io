* Duracell and Starbucks announced today that they have reached a partnership that will see wireless chargers installed into several Starbucks stores. The chargers will use Duracell’s Powermat technology, which works with a number of devices—including iPhones.
* Stores will be equipped with ‘Powermat Spots,’ which are designated areas on tables and counters where customers can place their devices to charge wirelessly. Starbucks believes this will be far more convenient for its customers than having to hunt down outlets…
* From the press release on Starbucks’ website:
* “From WiFi and the in-store Starbucks Digital Network to mobile payment and digital music downloads, we have always tried to anticipate our customers’ needs early in the adoption curve and provide a world-class solution. We are thrilled to offer our customers that next level of convenience with Powermat wireless charging. Rather than hunting around for an available power outlet, they can seamlessly charge their device while enjoying their favorite food or beverage offering right in our stores,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer at Starbucks. “We were pleased with the customer response to the pilot tests, and we’re now expanding this offering nationally to provide our customers a quality and reliable experience as they use our stores as their respite, their office away from home or as a gathering place with their friends and family.”
* The new technology is currently available in select Starbucks locations in San Francisco, San Jose and Boston, and will be expanded to additional major markets in 2015. The plan is to get over 100,000 chargers into 7,500 stores throughout the US within three years.
* Powermat Spots comply with the open standard set by the PMA, whose members include AT&T, Blackberry, HTC, LG, Microsoft and Samsung. iPhones obviously don’t support the tech [yet], but Duracell offers cases for various models that make them compatible.
