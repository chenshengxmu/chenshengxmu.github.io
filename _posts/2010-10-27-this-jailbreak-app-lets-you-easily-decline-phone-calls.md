* EZDecline is a new jailbreak app that let’s you easily decline phone calls. If your phone is locked and you receive a phone call, the only thing that will show on your screen is the “Slide to Answer” option. EZDecline tweaks that a bit by adding the buttons to “Decline” or “Answer”.
* Priced at $0.99, I don’t find this mod much useful because this feature is already available under a different form on your iPhone…
* When you get a phone call on your iPhone, you can easily stop the ringing by hitting the volume or power button once. The phone will keep ringing on the caller’s end but it won’t be ringing or vibrating on your end.
* Now if you want to send the caller to your voicemail, simply hit the power button twice. It will stop ringing/vibrating and the caller will be sent straight to your voicemail.
* Would you pay $0.99 for this tweak? Or like me, would you rather keep the stock features that give you the option to either turn off the ringing or send the caller to voicemail?
