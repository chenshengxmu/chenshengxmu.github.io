* Deutsche Telekom-owned wireless carrier T-Mobile USA today announced that all Simple Choice postpaid customers traveling to Brazil for 2016 Summer Olympics will be treated to unlimited high-speed 4G LTE data within the country during August.
* In unleashing Brazil this summer, T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere noted that not only will Rio de Janeiro visitors enjoy the Summer Olympics without worrying about roaming charges, but also free calls within Brazil and to U.S. during the month of August.
* The carrier will also give families of U.S. athletes free T-Mobile service and a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and Samsung Gear 360 camera through October, so they can capture and share “every exhilarating moment of the games without worrying about extra expenses or surprise roaming charges.”
* On top of these perks, all Simple Choice postpaid customers can take advantage of T-Mobile’s existing free texting to over 140 countries around the world.
* “AT&T is spending millions to put their logo all over the games as the official sponsor. They introduced a new ‘Brazil plan’ last month, so their customers can foot the bill for AT&T’s VIP parties and private suites in Rio,” said T-Mobile’s outspoken CEO.
* “That couldn’t be more different from the Un-carrier. T-Mobile is freeing customers to travel to the Rio Games and use their phones without worry.”
* Simple Choice postpaid customers don’t have to do anything in order to get these benefits as free data and calling will be automatically applied to their account as soon as they get off the plane in Rio. By conservative estimates, about 100,000 Americans will be traveling to Rio de Janeiro for 2016 Summer Olympics.
