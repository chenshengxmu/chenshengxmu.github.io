* Apple on Tuesday released the watchOS 4.1 software update for all Apple Watch models.
* To deploy this update to your wearable device, use the Software Update mechanism in the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone. Your Apple Watch must have at least 50 percent battery and be connected to its charging disk for the update to download.
* watchOS 4.1 brings a new Radio app, the ability to stream Beats 1 Radio, Apple Music or your iCloud Music Library over Wi-Fi or cellular straight from the wrist, 70+ new emoji and more.
* The new Radio app gives you access to Beats 1 live or any other Apple Music radio station while away from your phone or Wi-Fi. And with support for music streaming, you can now use Siri to play anything from Reggaeton hits to Top 40 tracks to French Garage Rock.
* On non-LTE watch models, music streaming works over Wi-Fi.

* watchOS 4.1 is great for fitness buffs because it allows their watch to sync fitness data with GymKit-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers and indoor bikes for more accurate distance, pace and energy burn metrics.
* Another notable addition is a brand new Wi-Fi toggle in Control Center which lets Series 3 owners quickly toggle Wi-Fi off to fall back to cellular instead.
* When you’re not connected to your iPhone but the watch is still connected to Wi-Fi, the SSID of your active network appears in the top left corner of Control Center.
* This is very handy when using your Apple Watch as a standalone device.
* watchOS 4.1 includes 70+ new emoji we saw in iOS 11.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.1.
* Some of them include crazy face, shushing face, vomiting face, vampire, T-rex, flying saucer and broccoli, plus more food types, animals and mythical creatures. Smiley faces are now more emotive and there are new gender-neutral characters and clothing options, too.
* What’s your favorite feature in watchOS 4.1 so far, and why?
