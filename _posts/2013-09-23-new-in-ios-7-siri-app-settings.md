* Apple has not only made Siri more intelligent and capable in iOS 7, but it’s also stopped referring to it as being in ‘beta.’ We’ve noted a number of the digital assistant’s improvements over the past few months, but here’s a cool little trick that was just pointed out to us…
* It seems that Siri is capable of pulling up the settings panels for both native and third-party applications, all you have to do is ask her. You can do this by giving the command ‘open settings’ while in an app, such as Mail or Notes, or by directly saying ‘open Mail settings.’
* This has worked for every app I’ve tried thus far, as long as they have a pane in the Settings app. That includes native apps like Notes and Mail, and third-party apps like Netflix and Hulu+. And it’s surprisingly handy, saving you from having to dig through settings menus.
* Now, I know there’s nothing particularly ground-breaking here, and I’m sure that many of our smart readers have known about this little trick for a few months. But this was new to us, so we figured we would pass it along, as it might be new and useful to other folks as well.
* Thanks Cason!
