* There has been a slight resurgence in activity for the jailbreak community this week compared to last week, but things are still a lot slower than they usually are due to the lack of a refreshing jailbreak release for iOS 10.
* Despite the lull, there have been some pretty interesting jailbreak tweak releases in Cydia this week, and we’ll be recapping on all of those on this roundup.
* EmojiSuggest – FREE

* EmojiSuggest is a great new tweak that brings Emoji to the predictive keyboard on jailbroken iOS 9 devices.
* As you’re typing words, it will suggest Emoji to use instead. This is a feature that comes native on iOS 10, but thanks to the tweak, you can have it on iOS 9 too.
* The tweak supports more than 700 words and can replace words with Emojis with just a tap.
* You can learn more about EmojiSuggest in our full review.
* PasswordRecovery – $1.50

* PasswordRecovery lets you recover your lost passwords and passcodes with Touch ID.
* It works with your social media apps, as well as with your device’s passcode, and should you ever forget them, you’ll never have to go through complicated password reset processes again, as a simple means of authenticating yourself will provide you with your password so you can sign in more easily.
* You can read our full review of PasswordRecovery to learn more about how it works and what it supports.
* NCTextColor: Lets you vibrantly color your Notification Center text (free – review)
* NCDarkClear: Darkens the title bars in Notification Center and lightens text cells (free)
* RiftBoard: Allows you to summon your Home sceen from any app with Activator ($1.99)
* WiJoin: Shows the network you connect to in a pop-up HUD (free – review)
* While that wraps it up for this week’s releases, next week is sure to bring more. In case you might have missed what was released last week, you can check out our previous roundup to see what else was launched recently.
* iOS 10 jailbreak watch:
* With no news from Pangu or TaiG of a jailbreak for iOS 10 just yet, the pressure is on as Apple continues to release rapid software updates for its mobile devices. Currently, iOS 9.3.3 is still the latest jailbreakable firmware, and there’s no projection for when iOS 10 might be jailbroken for the public.
