* Apple has announced that it is opening up its Touch ID fingerprint sensor to third-party developers. Reportedly years in the making, the all-new Touch ID API is available to registered iOS developers, making it easy to integrate Apple’s seamless fingerprint reading functionality into their apps without compromising Touch ID’s strong security…
* The Touch ID API protects logins and user data by tapping the Secure Enclave on Apple’s A7 processor, which protects data and isolates it from the rest of the system.
* Like with the iPhone 5s’s fingerprint sensing, your prints used in third-party apps never leave your device, are never synchronized with the cloud and – most importantly – developers never get to access your fingerprint data stored inside the Secure Enclave.
* Developers of apps like 1Password, PayPal, eBay and more will be able to use the Touch ID API to protect logins and user data (good-bye, passwords).
* Upon identifying a successful match, the API then unlocks related Keychain items. All the app knows is that there was a successful fingerprint match, nothing more.
* Cool, no?
