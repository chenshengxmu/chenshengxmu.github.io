* 9to5Mac has learned from several Apple employees that try-on appointments for the Apple Watch will begin on April 10, the same day the pre-ordering process is scheduled to kick off. You’ll be able to book an appointment through Apple’s website or via the company’s free of charge shopping app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* Although it will not be required to make an appointment to try on the Apple Watch at Apple’s retail stores come April 10, doing so will ensure that you’ll get your fifteen minutes of hands-on time with the device using one of the try-on stations in Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores.
* “Try-on appointments give every customer an equal opportunity to get hands on with Apple Watch,” reads Apple’s communiqué sent to retail employees.

* “Starting April 10, appointments can be made online or through the Apple Store app — they’re recommend, but not necessary,” reads the message.
* Again, people who waltz into one of Apple’s retail stores on or after April 10 will be able to go hands-on with the device, provided try-on stations have not been booked in advance at the time.
* Will you be making a Watch appointment?
