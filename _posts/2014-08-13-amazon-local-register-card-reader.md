* Taking the likes of PayPal Here and Square head on, the online retail giant Amazon today unveiled an iOS-connected credit card reader. Dubbed the Local Register, the accessory allows iPhone and iPad owners to accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit and debit cards on their device.
* The tiny dongle connects to an iOS device via the headphone jack and has a magnetic stripe that reads data from your credit card and transfers it securely to the device as an audio waveform.
* A free mobile app then verifies payment information and completes the transaction using Amazon’s processing backend. Amazon is savagely undercutting both Square and PayPal with lower transaction fees, starting at just 1.75 percent per swipe…
* This compares favorably to Square’s 2.75 percent per-swipe fee and PayPal’s 2.7 percent. As part of the launch promotion, Amazon’s low 1.75 percent fee is good through the end of 2014, after which the increased fee of 2.5 percent per swipe will come into effect.

* The company ensures that funds will be available in users’ bank accounts the next business day following a transaction. Unlike Square and PayPal that offer dongles free of charge, Amazon’s plastic reader (pictured below) costs $10 a pop, though the upfront payment will be credited back in processing fees.

* The following key features are highlighted in Amazon’s press release:

* A range of companion accessories are being offered such as smartphone and tablet cases, cash drawers, receipt printers, stands and what not. And last but not least, the company is selling the $380 Local Register bundle that includes a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 tablet.
