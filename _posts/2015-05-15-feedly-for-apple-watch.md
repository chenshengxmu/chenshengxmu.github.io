* Feedly, the popular feed aggregation service, is now available for the Apple Watch. The app allows you to browse the stories right on your wrist-worn device.
* Available as a free update to the existing Feedly for iPhone application, the Watch component selects the best stories from your Feedly account and presents them with a headline, the accompanying image, an excerpt of the full text and more.
* It supports other features via a hidden menu accessible through force-touching the screen such as tagging, saving a story for later, marking a story as read, continuing reading on your iPhone and more.
* As mentioned before, the app puts up to eight best stories from your Feedly account on your Apple Watch, with one tap to save, tag or open stories on your iPhone and continue reading them on the handset.

* As seen on the screenshots included here, each story displays the information needed to quickly decide if it is worth reading entirely, including title, engagement, source, teaser image and a few lines from that story.

* To scroll a story just turn the Digital Crown or swipe up or down. To view the next story, swipe to the right. To mark a story as read so it doesn’t appear on your other devices, without even opening it, tap the check button.
