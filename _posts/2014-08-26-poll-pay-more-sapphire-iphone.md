* That sapphire has become the smartphone industry’s latest new buzzword can be attributed to Apple. The Cupertino company has confirmed dropping north of $500 million for the procurement of cutting-edge furnaces and other sophisticated equipment needed for its new sapphire plant, the world’s largest.
* That facility is located in Mesa, Arizona and run on Apple’s behalf by a company called GT Advanced Technologies.
* Moreover, GT’s scientists have created a process called Hyperion 4 Ion Implanter to help mass-produce sapphire at affordable prices. Now, it’s been rumored for months that Apple, which holds a patent for ‘Sapphire Laminates,’ will protect the iPhone 6’s screen with ultra-thin sheets made from the precious gemstone.
* With sapphire’s hardness being second only to diamond, such a device would feature a virtually unbreakable screen. And with an estimated 20 percent of all broken iPhones suffering from smashed displays, sapphire could protect your pricey investment in case of accidental drops.
* Analysts caution that a high-end feature like a sapphire-strengthened screen could easily translate into a premium price. Which brings me to my question of the day: would you be willing to pay extra for an iPhone 6 with a sapphire screen?
* Assuming Apple can get enough of the material, Tim Cook & Co. are reportedly mulling sapphire screens “in more-expensive models” of the two larger iPhones debuting this Fall, according to the exact wording of this Wall Street Journal report.

* The not-so-reliable Jefferies analyst Peter Misek claimed earlier this year that Apple had been negotiating with wireless carriers to raise the iPhone 6 price due to the use of sapphire, with Chinese supply chain sources corroborating the notion.
* So, would sapphire be worth a premium to you, do you think?
* Cast your vote below.
* I want to hear your thoughts on the matter.
* As someone who has against all odds managed to drop two iPhones so far, I know how painful it is having to swallow the cost of replacement screens. Just thinking about these incidents makes me wanna pay a $100 or more for an iPhone 6 with a sapphire display.
