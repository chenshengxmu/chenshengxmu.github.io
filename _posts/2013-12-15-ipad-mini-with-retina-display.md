* Good news for folks trying to snag an iPad mini with Retina display in time for the holidays. Shipping times for the popular tablet have improved in Apple’s web store to 1-3 days for the US, Canada and several other countries.
* This applies to all configurations of the new mini, including both Space Gray and Silver colorways and Wi-Fi + Cellular models. And it means that, if you order soon, you can still get one shipped out for free before Christmas…
* Since the Retina mini’s surprise launch last month the tablet has seen severe supply constraints, reportedly due to production issues with the display. In late November, most models were showing shipping estimates of 5-10 days.

* In addition to these shorter shipping estimates, in-store supplies of the new iPad mini appear to have improved as well, with several colors and capacities available for immediate pickup in a number of Apple Stores around the US.
* If you must order online, Apple recommends that you do so by Monday, December 16 to guarantee arrival before the 25th with standard shipping. Wi-Fi only models start at $399, for 16GB, and Wi-Fi + Cellular models begin at $529.
