* The Notification Center in iOS 8 received a significant revamp, and the same can be said about the Notification Center in Yosemite. New in this year’s OS X revamp is the appearance of the Today View.
* The Today View contains pertinent information about your day from your Calendar, Stocks, Weather and more. It even has the ability to host widgets—both stock and third-party—directly within Notification Center. Watch our walkthrough video inside to see what I mean.
* To add a widget to Notification Center in Yosemite, open the Notification Center using the button in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar, click the Today tab, and click the Edit button at the bottom of the interface. From there, you can add, reorder, or remove widgets from the Today View.
* Last year’s version of Notification Center seemed more like an afterthought, but with OS X Yosemite, it’s finally starting to showcase its usefulness. What are your thoughts on the new and improved Notification Center?
