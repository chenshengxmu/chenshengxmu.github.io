* Heads up folks, Apple is giving away free copies of the popular Union photo app by Pixite right now. You can find promo codes for the app, which normally retails for $1.99, within the ‘Stores’ section of the Apple Store app on iOS.
* For those who aren’t familiar with it, Union is an elegant image blending tool that allows you to create superimposed, silhouetted, and double-exposed photos. It comes from the same team that created Fragment, Shift and Pigment.
* Apple describes the app:
* Union makes it effortless to create works of art through a variety of image-blending techniques. Superimpose your photos with textures, overlays or other images, then tune them to perfection using a superb palette of intuitive tools and brushes.
* And here are some screenshots:

* To grab your free copy, simply launch the Apple Store app, navigate to the ‘Stores’ tab located at the bottom, and scroll down to the bottom of the page. If you see the ‘Start something new’ image, you may try swiping to the right.
* Once you’ve spotted the Union promo, tap on it and follow the subsequent instructions. As always, availability varies depending on your country, and Apple says the offer expires on February 10.
