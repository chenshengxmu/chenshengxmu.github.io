* Cydia’s not getting any busier in the absence of a jailbreak for the latest iOS firmware, but that’s not to say that jailbreak tweak releases have ceased entirely. In this roundup, we’ll talk about this week’s Cydia traffic.
* This week really wasn’t anything to get excited about. If I were to give my opinion of this week, I’d say it was one of the quietest weeks for the jailbreak this entire year.
* Of course, with iOS 10 in beta, lots of developers are now focusing on it instead, and the public beta has certainly drawn in its fair share of testers as well.
* CCNotes: Lets you take notes right from Control Center (free)
* Although it’s not a vibrant list of releases this week due to the current condition of the jailbreak community, Pangu’s recent announcement illustrated that a jailbreak will imminently come once again in the future.
* If you are looking for more jailbreak tweaks to compliment your already jailbroken device, you can check out last week’s roundup and continue to tune in to iDB for more jailbreak tweak reviews.
