* The Internet giant Google has at last gotten around to updating the native Gmail application for iOS with native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* As a result, owners of these new devices can finally enjoy crisp typography and user interface while taking full advantage of the bigger canvas to see more of their emails and inbox without scrolling.
* Now available in the App Store free of charge, the new Gmail version 3.1415926 only lists native support for the new iPhone display sizes.
* If you use Gmail on your desktop, you’ll be delighted to learn that Gmail a week ago gained the ability to view images within your message full-screen.
* “Similar to attachments, you can now click on large images within a message to see them full-screen in Gmail on the web,” wrote the team in a post over at Google+.

* You can also click the Google Drive button to save the images directly to Drive or the arrow button to download them to your computer. Speaking of Google Drive, Gmail for iOS gained support for Google’s cloud-based storage back in July.
* As a reminder, Apple currently maintains a running list of major “Apps & Games for iPhone 6” so give it a quick look to see if your favorite software has gained support for the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus display sizes.
