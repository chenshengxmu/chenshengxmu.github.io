* Per the norm, Apple went through its routine of recapping many of the notable features available on its updated operating system. Craig Federighi took the stage to provide a recap, along with performing a demo showcasing iBooks, Maps, Finder tags, Safari Notifications, and more.
* Although none of that is news to those of us who’ve been following OS X Mavericks since WWDC 2013, there is one piece of important info that hasn’t been revealed until now — the price and release date. Just a few minutes ago, Apple revealed that OS X Mavericks would be free starting today!

* Not only will OS X Mavericks be free, but it will also be compatible with a wide range of Mac hardware, and feature direct upgrade paths from older OS X versions. Even those of you running an iMac from 2007 will be able to take advantage of the free OS X Mavericks update.
* Apple has really set a new bar for OS release prices. While direct competitors like Microsoft continue to demand hundreds of dollars for its latest OS updates, Apple does so for free.
* What do you think? Are you excited to try OS X Mavericks later on today?
