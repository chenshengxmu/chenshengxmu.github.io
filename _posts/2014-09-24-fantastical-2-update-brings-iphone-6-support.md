* Fantastical 2 has been updated on Wednesday to bring support for the larger screens of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, just about five days after the release of these devices. Unfortunately, users who were hoping for support for Notification Center widgets and interactive notifications will still have to wait as these features are not part of this update.
* Up until today, iPhone 6 users would only get a stretched out version of Fantastical, something that actually pushed yours truly to get away from Fantastical for a while to incorporate competing calendar apps into my workflow (Calendars 5). This shouldnâ€™t be a problem anymore as this update will allow to run Fantastical in all its splendor without bastardizing its scaling.
* Fantastical 2 can be downloaded in the App Store for iOS and Mac:
