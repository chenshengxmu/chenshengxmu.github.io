* Last year, Apple expanded its recycling program to include the Apple Watch. Now a year later, Apple is offering Apple Store gift cards for qualifying trade-ins of the wearable.
* As they do for other tech such as older iPhones, when you trade in your Apple Watch, you can get a gift card to use towards a new device.
* Depending on the device, it appears right now you can earn $50-$175 for your old Apple Watch depending on which model, and the condition it is in.

* An original, working 38mm aluminum Apple Watch will net you $50, and a working 42mm Series 2 stainless steel model will bring in $175.
* The program is done through a partnership with BrightStar, who Apple has been working with since the program launched in 2013.
* To recycle your tech, you fill out the questionnaire about your device, send it in, and once they confirm the appraisal, they will issue a gift card in the proper amount.
* While it definitely has a convenience factor, you are probably better off trying to sell your device elsewhere to bring in a little bit more.
