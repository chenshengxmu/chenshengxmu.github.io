* One more feature to make our ultimate list of new iOS 5 features is the ability to now use your iPhone while it is syncing with iTunes. Until now, you couldn’t use your iPhone or iDevice while it was syncing. This is now a thing of the past.
* As you can see on the image above, the new “syncing” icon is running in the status bar, but I can still “slide to unlock” to use my iPhone. Jailbreakers might already be familiar with this feature as it was first made possible with Synchronicity…
* Finally, we can now both sync and text at the same time, that is, if you’re not using iCloud Sync of course.
* Thanks to Nadal for the tip.
