title: The 16GB version of the Samsung Galaxy S4 only has 8GB of usable storage
---
* In their review of the new Samsung Galaxy S4, CNET found out the following:
* Nearly half of the S4’s storage space (after a factory reset, our 16GB Galaxy S4 showed 8.49GB of available room) is taken up with the phone’s operating system and built-in apps, limiting the amount of data you can store on the company’s quad-core monster.
* Now the question is, should Samsung sell it as an 8GB phone?
