* Apple appears to be really determined to avoid having this Maps thing snowball into a devastating PR catastrophe which, by the way, already has tarnished Apple’s reputation. Following yesterday’s unexpected CEO apology and the subsequent recommendation of mapping services on the web as well as third-party Maps alternatives, Apple has made a subtle change in Maps wording.
* No longer are Apple Maps being referred to as “the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever”. Instead, the app’s now about “a beautiful vector-based interface that scales and zooms with ease”…
* Seth Weintraub, who runs 9to5 sites, points us to a discovery by German-language blog iDaily which first spotted the change.
* Check out the ‘before’ and ‘after’ screenshots:

* The Maps page on Apple’s website used to read (emphasis mine):
* Designed by Apple from the ground up, Maps gives you interactive 3D views and the stunning Flyover feature. All of which may just make this app the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.
* Now it reads:
* Designed by Apple from the ground up, Maps gives you interactive 3D views and the stunning Flyover feature. All in a beautiful vector-based interface that scales and zooms with ease.
* Good thing Apple didn’t pitch Maps as “the most accurate” mapping service ever.
* iOS Maps certainly is “the most beautiful” mapping service ever and I find it odd that Apple removed that part.
* I guess they didn’t want people to associate iOS 6 Maps with the looks alone.
* Thoughts?
