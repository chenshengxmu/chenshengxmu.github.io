* In what seems to be the rule more than the exception these days, a jailbreak was released out of the blue with basically no prior warning, catching us all by surprise. It’s great to be surprised by something so random, but it’s also a tad disconcerting and tends to send us scrambling to dissect details and separate fact from fiction.
* As you’ve seen already, we’ve personally tested out the TaiG jailbreak tool for iOS 8.1.1. Should you take the plunge now? Here’s what we know thus far.

* Also… Was it really worth pushing another jailbreak when 8.1 was still being signed? O.o (8.1.1 has hardly any changes)

* Indeed. It’s very bizarre that a jailbreak was released even though we technically didn’t “need” one at the moment. I’d love to be a fly on the wall at some of the TaiG decision making meetings.
* What do you think about this jailbreak? My advice is to simply use iOS 8.1 along with the Pangu8 jailbreak for the time being. Ultimately, I think that the TaiG tool will checkout fine, but there shouldn’t be any rush since iOS 8.1 is still being signed. Sound off with your thoughts and observations below.
