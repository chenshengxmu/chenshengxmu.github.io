* German blog Macerkopf.de is reporting that Apple’s upcoming ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ smartphones will hit store shelves on Friday, September 18, or nine days following the rumored September 9 unveiling that BuzzFeed’s usually-reliable John Paczkowski recently reported on.
* Apparently two of Germany’s top three wireless carriers expect to kick off sales of the new handsets on Friday, September 18.
* This assumed schedule would match up nicely with past iPhone release patterns.
* Carriers would know in advance when the next iPhones are coming, but it doesn’t exactly take a genius to figure out the exact launch date yourself: common sense and conventional wisdom suggest Apple won’t steer away from past launch timelines.
* So if there’s a media event scheduled for Wednesday, September 9, Apple should start accepting pre-orders for the new phones on Friday, September 11, before first shipments start hitting customers’ doorsteps and arriving in stores the following Friday, September 18.
* If history is an indication, the new devices will first launch in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and a few other key markets in terms of size and revenue. The second wave of iPhone 6s launch could be due on September 26, as reported today by Dutch blog TechTastic.nl (Google Translate).

* Make sense?
* It’s indicative that Germany’s #1 telecom provider, Deutsche Telekom, recently opened an online reservations system for those looking to buy unreleased iPhones.
* The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are said to offer a stronger, Bendgate-proof aluminum body, more advanced cameras with greater pixel count, a faster A9 processor with system-in-package design and 2GB of RAM, support for the faster 300Mbps LTE networking, force-sensing screen, upgraded NFC hardware, a faster Touch ID and other improvements over the present-generation models.

* In addition to the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus (and maybe a rumored iPhone 6c), September 9 should also bring us some new iPads and a refreshed, slimmer and faster Apple TV hardware with Siri voice control, a redesigned remote with touch controls, downloadable apps and games via an Apple TV App Store and more.
* In addition to hardware changes, a next-generation Apple TV is also said to be based on iOS 9 software and include a revamped user interface to make the set-top box look and feel more in line with other iOS products.
