* Here at iDB, we love a good Kickstarter project. Created so independent designers and inventors can get the funding needed to progress, Kickstarter has been home to numerous much-loved tech in the past.
* The latest iDevice to receive the Kickstarter treatment is a smartphone and tablet stand, dubbed “The Infinite Loop.”
* Yeah, we loved the Mothership reference in there too…..
* While The Infinite Loop might not be much to look at, it’s innards are where the magic happens.
* According to the project’s owner, designer Tim Gushrue, the stand’s rigidity and flexibility comes courtesy of a new, patented construction.
* “By using patented co molded metal and plastic form that can easily bend to any shape gives the InfiniteLoop the strength and rigidity to hold up a heavy iPad. The suction caps and adjustable side clips also allow it to fit virtually any iPad, tablet or smartphone on the market.”
* Coming in two sizes – 2ft for smartphones and 4ft for tablets – the stand can be used for pretty much anything you want, with turning an iPhone into a floating GPS device perhaps our favorite.
* Gushrue has put together a typically-impressive video to show off the fruits of his labor, and we’re sure you’ll agree, that’s one (well, two) impressive pieces of kit.
* The Kickstarter project is currently at $19,356 pledged and needs to hit $27,500 before a July 22nd deadline in order for The Infinite Loop to go into production. Pledges can be made via the project’s Kickstarter page and range between the minimum of $1 to a ‘$500 or more’ threshold. For that much money you’ll receive a limited edition package, complete with Gushrue’s autograph.
* “You will also receive a limited edition individually numbered red version signed by the designer himself + you will receive the 3 limited edition black InfiniteLoops and MiniLoops + 7 white InfiniteLoops and MiniLoops. Shipping included.”
* We’ve made our pledge and hopefully more will, too.
* Full press release below:
* “San Francisco California – Next door to Silicone Valley, home of the iPad, is where Tim Gushue, a designer and engineer crafted the InfiniteLoop: the simple solution to the iPads’ global gravity problem. “The InfiniteLoop was born out of my frustration and many other’s frustration. I wanted an everlasting device that could support my iPad anywhere all the time,” says Gushue. It’s an iPad, millions use it everyday, so why shouldn’t there be a stand that can accommodate daily uses such as reading in bed, watching a movie on a plane or doing FaceTime. Gushue set about working through many different concepts and through this process he found that the more versatile the design became, the more simple the form ended up. By using patented co molded metal and plastic form that can easily bend to any shape gives the InfiniteLoop the strength and rigidity to hold up a heavy iPad. The suction caps and adjustable side clips also allow it to fit virtually any iPad, tablet or smartphone on the market. The InfiniteLoop may be the simplest and most versatile tablet and smartphone stand ever. With full flexibility, it can work virtually anywhere you can think of a use for.
* Let’s admit, Apple will change their design again, but you won’t have to go and buy another stand.”
* What do you think?
