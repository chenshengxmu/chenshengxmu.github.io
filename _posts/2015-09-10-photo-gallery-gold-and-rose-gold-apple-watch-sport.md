* On top of new bands, Apple announced two new anodized aluminum cases for the entry level Apple Watch yesterday: Gold, and Rose Gold. Armed with my best camera (that would be my iPhone 6), I visited my local Apple Store to see for myself what the new Apple Watch Sport cases look like. I must say I was a bit skeptical about how these finishes would look like on the aluminum version of the device, but after going hands on, I must say I am impressed. 
* If anything, these two new anodized cases look better to me than their Edition counterparts that are priced at about 40 times the price. Have a look at the few pictures I snapped and tell me what you think. Keep in mind that these photos don’t really do the devices justice as they are more beautiful in person, at least in my humble opinion.
* Note: click on each photo for full size image.
* As mentioned above, I would almost argue that the Gold Aluminum Apple Watch looks better than the Apple Watch Edition. It has this less shiny, and less “look at me” attitude. I’d also argue that this model is by far the most appealing one from the Sport collection.

* The Rose Gold finish looks gorgeous, but definitely more on the feminine side. It has a beautiful shine to it that accentuates the rose highlights depending on the light. If my wife didn’t already own a Stainless Steel Apple Watch, I have the feeling this would be the one she’d want.

* Again, these photos don’t really do justice to these new additions to the Sport collection, but they might give you a better idea of what they look like than what you’ll see on Apple’s website.
* What do you think?
