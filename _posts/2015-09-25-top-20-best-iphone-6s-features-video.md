* After an agonizing two week wait, the iPhone 6s is finally here. Although this is an ‘S’ model year, a time when most of the changes are internal, there are lots and lots of new and notable additions to the iPhone 6s.
* In this video overview, I consider 20 new features that you’ll find in Apple’s new flagship phones. Some claim that not much has changed with the iPhone 6s when compared to last year’s model, but this lengthy list says otherwise.
* Of course, you will always find additional features that weren’t included (such as the new keyboard trackpad mode with 3D Touch), but these are some of the main bullet point items. If you want to get technical, you could probably throw iOS 9 as a whole on that list as well.
* Which new feature found in the iPhone 6s happens to be your favorite? Personally speaking, I have to say that having 2GB of RAM in an iPhone feels downright awesome. That’s my favorite new feature. What about yours?
