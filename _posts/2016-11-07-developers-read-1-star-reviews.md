* User-submitted reviews on the App Store can be quite mean. There’s no denying the fact that people too often slam app makers with 1-star reviews without much thinking.
* Now, some of the most unfavorable app ratings are based on complaints about the most mundane things such as the size of the font, the color palettes or the lack of features users think developers should have prioritized over the others and what not.
* In case you haven’t yet seen this video in which well-known developers read aloud some of the 1-star reviews their apps contend with, give it a quick watch now and meet us in comments.
* “How do iPhone app developers feel about their reviews? For Úll 2016, We asked some of our friends to share their reviews,” reads the video’s description.
* The clip features well-known names from the third-party iOS development scene, including James Thompson (PCalc), Marco Arment (Overcast), Oisin Prendiville (Castro), David Smith (Sleep++) and others.
* Check out the video below.
* I think developers have a point about some of the 1-star reviews not being fair.
* People whine about anything and everything these days. I bet many of iTunes posters who are quick punish developers with just one star don’t realize how important reviews are to the rest of us who rely on honest user-submitted reviews in making an informed purchasing decision.
