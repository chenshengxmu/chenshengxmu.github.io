* igSpeedster is a new jailbreak tweak that’s squarely aimed at social media managers with multiple Instagram accounts. But you don’t need to be a social media manager to benefit from igSpeedster, as it’s not uncommon for a person to have multiple Instagram accounts.
* I like to keep my personal and work Instagram accounts separate, so a tweak like this is right up my alley. Yet, igSpeedster does more than just let you manage multiple accounts. It adds the ability to save images to your photo library, tap on links, copy captions, and repost photos. It really is one of the best Instagram jailbreak tweaks that I’ve seen thus far.
* Obviously, the tweak’s biggest draw is its ability to use multiple Instagram accounts on the same iPhone. On a stock iPhone, you’ll need to log out and log back in with an alternative account every time you wish to switch accounts. That’s cumbersome and time consuming. igSpeedster can save you loads of time, because you can quickly switch between accounts and add new accounts with just a swipe of the Instagram app icon. You can also switch accounts by long-pressing on the profile icon button inside of the app.

* igSpeedster is built on the backbone established by a preexisting tweak called Slices. Slices was a jailbreak tweak that allowed you to manage multiple accounts for a variety of applications. The developers of igSpeedster licensed the tech used by Slices and incorporated a simpler to use method for switching accounts. With that in mind, igSpeedster is actually easier to use and more streamlined than Slices, and as such, is more of a pleasure to use day in and day out.

* Along with the multiple account management, igSpeedster brings several other notable features to the table, including:
* If you’re an Instagram user, then you really should give igSpeedster a try, as it comes with a free trial. Once you’re finished with the trial, the developers are allowing users to pay per month what they deem the tweak to be worth. I haven’t been able to do this yet, but it looks like the minimum is $0.25 a month for a total of $3.00.
* igSpeedster is available right now on the BigBoss repo. If you’re a social media manager, this tweak is a no-brainer, but even if you’re just a normal IG user, give it a try; I guarantee you won’t regret doing so.
* What do you think?
