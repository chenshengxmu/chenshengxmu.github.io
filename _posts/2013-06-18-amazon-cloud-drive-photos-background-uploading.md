* Amazon’s Cloud Drive Photos app debuted in May, giving iDevice owners an easy way to browse image files stored in their Amazon cloud storage.
* Among other features, the iPhone/iPad application allows for downloading of individual images straight to your iDevice. You can also batch-upload your on-device snaps up to the cloud, useful if you want to keep your photos securely backed up in the cloud (and trust Amazon with your data – okay, that was a joke).
* Unfortunately, the app doesn’t support background network activity, and that’s a shame as quiting it or even receiving a phone call stops any upload in progress. Amazon finally saw to that, having updated Cloud Drive Photos with support for Background Save feature, along with other improvements…
* According to changelog, version 1.3.59 lets you:
* • Use Background Save to upload photos when Cloud Drive isn’t running • Manually select albums to save to Cloud Drive or download to your device • Simplified WiFi and Cellular Auto-Save options in Settings
* Just like public Photo Streams in iOS 6, photos uploaded to the Amazon cloud can be enjoyed online in any web browser.
* The new Background Save function taps an iOS 6 API that allows apps to upload data in the background. Apple limited the API to a few minutes worth of background network activity (except for streaming music, which is handled by a different set of APIs) in order to preserve your battery.

* At WWDC, Apple tackled this issue with a set of new APIs that improve how third-party apps multitask on iOS 7. Developers who choose to implement these can now count on longer background activity for network-related tasks.
* Most interestingly, apps can now tell the operating system about which content should be kept up to date, with iOS 7 taking care of smart scheduling.
* “Because iOS 7 learns when you like to use your apps and can update your content before you launch them,” Apple’s iOS 7 Features page explains. “So if you tend to check your favorite social app at 9:00 a.m. every day, your feed will be ready and waiting for you.”
* Apple further explains:
* Keep the content of your app up-to-date by adopting the new multitasking APIs in iOS 7. The new services allow your app to update information and download content in the background without draining the battery unnecessarily.
* The updates can happen at opportunistic times and are intelligently scheduled according to usage, so your app can update content in the background just when your users need it.
* This is going to appease to developers of social apps like Twitter clients, who complained about iOS 6 not letting them update users’ feeds in the background.
* You can download Amazon Cloud Drive Photos free from the App Store. Android users can go to Google’s Play store, where the app’s been available since November.
* Amazon also has the Cloud Player app designed for on-demand streaming of music kept in your Amazon locker up in the sky.
