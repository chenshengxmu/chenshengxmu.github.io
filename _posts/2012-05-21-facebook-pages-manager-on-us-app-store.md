* We told you five days ago that Facebook was rolling out a brand new iPhone app to manage your Facebook Pages. The software originally landed on the New Zealand App Store and it obviously took longer than expected, but here it is finally so grab it quickly.
* The app should be indispensable to anyone managing their own Pages on Facebook.
* Unlike the official Facebook for iOS client, the free Pages Manager app lets you check out comments, drill through logs, post updates, get notifications on new activity and so forth…
* Facebook Pages Manager is a free download right from the App Store.
* Here, your release notes.
* Pages Manager helps admins connect with their audience and keep up with activity on multiple Pages, all in one place.
* Features: – Post new updates and photos as your Page – Get notified about new activity on your Page when it happens, no matter where you are – Respond, post and comment as your Page while you’re on-the-go – Manage all your Facebook Pages from one app – View your latest Page Insights
* Just install Pages Manager and then log in using Facebook to quickly access and manage all of your Pages from wherever you are.
* We don’t want to be nit-picky, but it would be nice if both the official Facebook client and Pages Manager got merged into a single app.

* Also, an app like this should support the iPad natively to really take advantage of its bigger canvas. Here’s to the hoping these will be addressed in one of future updates.
* Do you manage Pages on Facebook?
* If so, we’d love to hear your impressions about the program down in the comments.
