* Hurricane Sandy is piling up the water as it’s on track for a historic hit on the East Coast of the United States. President Obama has declared state of emergency in New York, suspending subway and bus service, closing schools on Monday and scheduling the Holland and Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to also close at 2pm today.
* When it became clear that Sandy would make landfall on the East Coast, Google cancelled its previously scheduled October 29 press conference, postponing the launch of promising new Nexus smartphones and tablets. Dozens of Apple Stores along the East Coast will likely be affected, with many outlets taking precautionary measures in order to protect the products, store space itself and staffers. Several Apple Stores have also been spotted using sandbags as a precaution to protect their storefront from damage…
* For our readers overseas who may not be aware of the destructive potential of this imminent storm, Sandy is now officially classed as a category-1 hurricane. It’s expected to bring life-threatening flooding to the US mid-Atlantic coast and hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Massachusetts, Monday evening and into Tuesday.
* According to ifoAppleStore, a minimum of 35 Apple retail stores are located within the landfall prediction zone, as defined by the National Weather Service. Jake Smith of 9to5Mac points us to images on Twitter showing Apple’s flagship Fifth Avenue Store in New York on lockdown as the hurricane approaches.
* The storefront is being blocked off with sandbags. Inside the store, employees use plastic bags to protect MacBooks, iPads, iPhones and iPads from water damage.

* The Fifth Avenue store features a subterranean retail space, complicating the situation for staffers. No wonder Apple is thinking about temporarily closing this store.
* According to the author:
* We learned Apple Stores on the East Coast are warning its employees that stores may be closed Monday and Tuesday – depending how the weather pans out.
