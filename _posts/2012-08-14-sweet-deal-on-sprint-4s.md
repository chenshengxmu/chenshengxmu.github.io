* With the new iPhone event just a few weeks away, retailers have started to heavily discount current models of the handset in an effort to clear inventory and maintain sales during the lull.
* Best Buy and Target are currently knocking $50 off all models of the iPhone 4 and 4S, starting as low as $49.99. And Sprint has just sweetened the deal with a $100 AER gift card…
* 9to5Mac is reporting that Sprint is now offering a free $100 American express Reward Card along with the purchase of a 16GB iPhone 4S. Add this on top of the $50 discount, and you could essentially score an iPhone 4S for $50.
* Even better, it appears that Apple is matching the giveaway, offering users $100 in Apple Store credit along with the purchase of a Sprint 4S. BusinessInsider says it has confirmed this with a New York-based location.
* This is easily the best deal we’ve ever seen on the 4S, and a steal for folks who aren’t interested in the upcoming model. Just remember, the offer comes with a two-year carrier contract and appears to be in-store only.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
