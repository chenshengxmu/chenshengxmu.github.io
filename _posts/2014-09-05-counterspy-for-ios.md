* After releasing on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita last month, Sony’s CounterSpy is now available on Apple’s iOS platform.
* Developed by Dynamighty and published on the App Store by Sony Computer Entertainment America as a premium $4.99 download, CounterSpy is set in an alternate history Cold War era and puts you in the shoes of a budding agent for C.O.U.N.T.E.R.
* Your goal in this action stealth side-scrolling game: stop a crazed superpower from unleashing a devastating nuclear missile attack unto the entire world.
* You’ll be discovering blueprints and dossiers to gain access to new weapons and in-game features. According to developers, the game uses procedural content generation for mission diversity so content is always changing “to offer something new and challenging”.
* Here’s a nice video showing off coverbased shooting gameplay, courtesy of TouchArcade.
* And those who already own it on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita systems can link the iOS edition of CounterSpy to its console counterpart to “complete your experience”.
