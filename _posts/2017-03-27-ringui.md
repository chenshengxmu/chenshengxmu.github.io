* If you’re not a fan of this system-wide rounded style, a new free jailbreak tweak called ringUI by CydiaGeek can be installed to make several elements on your device look much squarer.
* After you install ringUI, a new preferences pane is added to the Settings app so you can remove the roundness effects from a number of things in iOS:

* Because ringUI is an aesthetic tweak, whether or not it looks good to you will come down to personal opinion. Installing the tweak won’t impact the usability of your device in any way, as it’s simply intended to let you to make your device look different from everyone else’s.
* If you’re interested in trying ringUI, you can grab it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 8, 9 and 10 devices.
