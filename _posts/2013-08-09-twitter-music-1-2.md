* Twitter’s #music app launched in April as a way to discover music people share on Twitter. The micro-blogging giant updated the software in June with new discovery charts and the addition of genres. Since then, we haven’t heard much from Twitter on the music front until today’s version 1.3 update which expands on content discovery with new tools while adding the ability to scan your music library to provide personalized recommendations…
* You can now discover new music by listening to artist’s top tracks and similar artists. Additionally, it is now possible to browse the artists that your favorite artist follows on Twitter or to quickly find the artists that you’ve tweeted about in the past.
* Personalized recommendations are an important component of social music tools – even more so considering competition from Spotify, Rdio and iTunes Radio – and Twitter #music is no exception. The new version can now scan your iPhone’s music library to suggest more relevant artists to you.

* And if you live in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland, the app is now localized into your language.
* By the way, iTunes Radio in Apple’s iOS 7 Music app includes a personalized station based on the music that’s trending on Twitter.
* Twitter #music for the iPhone/iPod touch is available free of charge from the App Store.
