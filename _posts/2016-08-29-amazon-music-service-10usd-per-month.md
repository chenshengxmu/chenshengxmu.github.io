* Amazon already has a music store, but its catalog of songs is limited and streaming is only available to those subscribed to the company’s $99 per year Prime service. As Re/code said, the online retail giant has also considered a bargain-priced music service that would only work on Echo hardware and be priced at $4 to $5 per month.
* Monday, The Financial Times newspaper reported that Amazon has a third offering in the works, a $9.99 per month music-streaming service that would offer the full catalogue of songs that Spotify and Apple offer.
* The online retail giant is reportedly “nearing deals” with major record labels and sources indicated that a yet-to-be-named service would launch as soon as next month.
* “Amazon is likely to pay the music labels royalty rates comparable to those of Apple,” said folks familiar with the company’s plans.
* Corroborating a recent Wall Street Journal article, the Rupert Murdoch-owned financial newspaper said that Pandora is also “closing in” on licensing agreements that would allow it to launch an on-demand streaming service of its own.

* Pandora’s service would have two tiers—$5 per month and $10 per month—and let music lovers listen to songs in any order. In other words, it should be a true on-demand streaming service, as opposed to Pandora’s current “Internet radio” model.
* Pandora is looking to debut its new offering later this year, but “someone close to the company” is adamant that a September launch is unlikely. Apple Music, as you know, is priced at $10 per month, or $14.99 per month for a family of six.
* Spotify, SoundCloud, Deezer, Tidal and Google Play also offer music subscriptions for $9.99 a month, while Vevo has flagged plans to introduce a service later this year.
