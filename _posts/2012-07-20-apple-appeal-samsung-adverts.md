* Apple is going to appeal a U.K. court ruling from earlier this week which mandates that Cupertino post a public apology on both its website and in British newspapers, basically free advertisement telling the public that Samsung did not copy the iPad’s design, per the court’s ruling. As this legal mess is being sorted out, Joy of Tech has an excellent take on what this notice could be like, included right below…
* Kit Chellel, reporting for Bloomberg:
* Apple’s lawyer said the company would appeal the July 9 decision and Judge Birss granted the company permission to take its case to the court of appeal.
* The ruling requires that Apple keeps a notice on its website for six months and buy ad slots to publish the notice in the Financial Times, the Daily Mail, Guardian Mobile magazine and the T3 magazine.
* How embarrassing.
* In other legal news, The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied two Samsung motions, one related to the preliminary injunction for the duration of the appellate proceedings that Apple won against the Galaxy Tab 10.1 a month ago and the other pertaining to Samsung’s motion to expedite the appeal.
* Man, those high-level CEO talks are leading nowhere.
* As for Apple appealing this unusual U.K. ruling, you’ll recall that Judge Colin Birss specifically wrote in the ruling that the iPad is “cool” while remarking that Samsung’s Galaxy Tab tablets, though “very, very similar” when viewed from the front, “are not as cool”.
* Perhaps unsurprisingly, on the other side of Atlantic a U.S. court has found out quite the opposite, that the two tablets bear some striking similarities design-wise.
* Speaking of which, this is what the original iPad prototype looked like back in 2001 (click here for comparison with iPad 2). Should you need further proof that Apple got the short end of the stick, here’s a clever take on the situation by the ever-humorous Joy of Tech.

* My favorite is Jony Ive’s design-inclined proposal which calls for white text on a white background, pretty funny.
* Knowing Apple, they’ll find a way to honor the form and bury the notice somewhere at the bottom, downplaying its importance with ambiguous wording, no?
