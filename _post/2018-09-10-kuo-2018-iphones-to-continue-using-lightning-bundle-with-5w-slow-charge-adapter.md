* Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today issued a research note to clients in which he outlined some interesting predictions about Apple’s upcoming product refreshes. According to the analyst, 2018’s iPhones won’t ditch Lightning I/O for USB-C like iPad Pros nor will they include a stronger, Power Delivery-compatible power adapter to support the fast charge function.
* Several reports claim 2018’s iPhones would ship with 18-watt chargers and USB-C to Lightning cables, but it would now seem that iPhones won’t be making a jump to USB-C before 2019.
* In the same report, the analyst has predicted that all iPad Pro models introduced this year will include USB-C, not Lightning, and be bundled with an 18-watt USB Power Delivery adapter.

* Everyone betting against Kuo should think twice. This is the most reliable Apple analyst out there with an almost stellar (but not perfect) track record. Kuo’s main strength is his address book—the guy knows his way around Apple’s supply chain and more often than not bases his predictions on industry chatter and critical information obtained from Asian suppliers.

* Today’s report corroborates an earlier story saying Apple began notifying MFi licensees that they’d be permitted to sell fully-certified USB-C to Lightning cables starting next year.
* TUTORIAL: How to fast charge iPhone or iPad
* Currently, people who would like to fast charge their compatible iPhone are required to purchase a USB Power Delivery-compliant charger (15 watts is required to fast charge an iPhone) and a Lightning to USB cable, currently sold exclusively by Apple for $19 a pop.
