* We’ve taken a look a look at what’s new in iOS 11.2 beta 3, but one thing that slipped under the radar is the inclusion of faster wireless charging on iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.
* Currently, iOS 11.1.1 limits wireless charging on the latest iPhone models to only five watts of power, which is fairly slow. I briefly placed my updated iPhone X and iPhone 8 with iOS 11.2 beta 3 on the ravPOWER and Belkin wireless chargers I had on hand, and it did look as though they are charging more quickly than on iOS 11.1.1.

* 7.5W is definitely an improvement, but it’s still lacking in the world of wireless charging.
* Although the current Qi 1.2 standard allows for up to 15 watts of power for wireless charging, there’s no indication Apple will be supporting that on the current phones. There does seem to be a little confusion on which wireless chargers will work with the updated charging speeds.
* Belkin and Mophie are the only two companies that are sold through Apple.
* If you ask them, they will tell you only companies that have partnered with Apple can support the faster 7.5 watts of wireless power. However, at least so far in my testing, the RAVPower charger we reviewed also seems to support it. I’m sure we will learn more once Apple makes the feature inclusion official with the release of iOS 11.2.
* Of course, there are numerous ways to charge your iPhone faster than wireless charging, such as through the 12W iPad wall adapter or a USB-C Lighting cable and a fast charge wall adapter.
* Do you use wireless charging with your iPhone X or iPhone 8?
