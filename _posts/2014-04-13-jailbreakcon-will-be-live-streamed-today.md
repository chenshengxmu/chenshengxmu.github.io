* This is day two of JailbreakCon 2014. Yesterday was focused on small workshops and short talks by a variety of speakers, including yours truly. Today, the whole day will be focused on talks by some of the biggest names in the jailbreak community, such as Ryan Petrich, pod2g and Saurik.
* If you couldn’t make it to San Francisco, you’ll be happy to learn that today’s event will be livestreamed so you won’t miss one bit of it all…
* Click here to view the live stream, which should start around 10.
* In the meanwhile, Jeff and I will be setting up a mobile recording studio where we hope to record an episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak.
* Oh, and for those that are here today, we might have one or two Let’s Talk Jailbreak t-shirts to give away.
