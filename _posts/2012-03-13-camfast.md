title: CamFast now available on Cydia
---
* Yesterday we brought you a sneak preview of CamFast (previously FastCam), and it’s a tweak that allows you to invoke the iPhone’s camera API using a simple Activator action.
* The nice thing about CamFast is that it even works at the Lock screen, and is faster than Apple’s 5.1 Lock screen camera improvements.
* Be sure to watch our video demonstration above to see how it works in action.
