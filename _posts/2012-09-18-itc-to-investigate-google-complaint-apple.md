* Even though Motorola Mobility filed a complaint against Apple on August 17, the handset maker is now a Google-owned entity so this really reads as the Google v. Apple complaint. Unsurprisingly, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) today announced that it will be instituting a formal investigation of this complaint.
* Within 45 days after institution of the investigation, the ITC will set a target date for completing the investigation and a panel of six administrative law judges will schedule and hold an evidentiary hearing pertaining to Motorola’s (excuse me, Google’s) complaint…
* According to the ITC website, by instituting this investigation the USITC has not yet made any decision on the merits of the case.
* The U.S. International Trade Commission has voted to institute an investigation of certain wireless communication devices, portable music and data processing devices, computers, and components thereof. The products at issue in this investigation are certain Apple iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple personal computers.
* If the judges find Apple infringing upon Googlerola’s patents (like in Germany), the decision could see Apple’s Mac computers, iPhones and iPads banned from sale in the United States.
* The Illinois-based Droid maker said back in August that “we would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple’s unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers’ innovations”.
* It’s worth pointing out that Google probably has broader agenda in mind, especially after Apple scored a billion dollar verdict in the high-stake U.S. trial against Android-backer Samsung last month.
* Does Google have a shot, what do you think?
