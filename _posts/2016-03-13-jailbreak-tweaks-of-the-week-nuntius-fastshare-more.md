* FastShare is a tweak that brings Facebook, Messages, and Twitter sharing options altogether into a unified user interface that can be invoked with an Activator gesture.
* Although you can already use Activator gestures to Tweet, Post to Facebook, or send messages, you would normally have to assign one Activator gesture to each, which is a bit of a waste of limited gestures to pick from.
* With this tweak, you only use one Activator gesture, and you get a customizable iOS-esque user interface. You can learn more about the workings of FastShare via our full review.
