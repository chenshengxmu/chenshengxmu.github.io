* Call it awkward, or call it ironic, but a recent J.D. Power wireless router satisfaction report put Apple at the top, with a score of 876, followed by ASUS (860), D-Link (856) and TP-Link (854). This report obviously comes at an interesting time as the company was rumored this month to be disbanding its router unit and stop developing AirPort wireless routers. 
* According to the report, “satisfaction is measured across 10 factors (listed in order of importance): Wi-Fi range; reliability; speed of upload/download; restore connection easily; security capabilities; price; ease of use; variety of features; intuitive user interface; and customer service.”
* There are many options available when it comes to wireless routers, and many of them are much more affordable than Apple’s family of AirPort devices, but ease-of-use has always been the AirPort’s forte. As far range and reliability, my experience has been mediocre, to say the least, but I guess I am in the minority here.
