* According to DigiTimes, Apple has allegedly cancelled its iPad 3 supply schedule for the latter half of 2011. Rumors have speculated that Apple would launch a third generation tablet at an upcoming media event this Fall, but sources overseas have confirmed that Apple has in fact postponed its launch for a later date.
* Apple is still expected to unveil a new iPhone this Fall, with rumors suggesting that two new iPhone models could be introduced at once. The iPod line is expected to see a refresh as well, but those details remain a mystery.
* “Apple was originally set to launch its iPad 3 in the second half of 2011 with a supply volume of 1.5-2 million units in the third quarter and 5-6 million in the fourth quarter, but Apple’s supply chain partners have recently discovered that the related figures have all already been deleted, the sources pointed out.”
* The next iPad was rumored to have a higher density 2,048 x 1,536, 9.7-inch display. According to DigiTimes, the high price of the display components Apple orders from manufacturers like Sharp and Samsung has hindered the company from being able to mass produce its next tablet for 2011.
* “Technology restrictions” with the new panels also seem to be an issue:
* “Sources from panel players also pointed out that the 9.7-inch panel with high resolution requires a much larger backlight source and a single edge light bar is hardly able to reach satisfaction levels. Due to iPad 3’s requirements over the physical thinness, rich color support and toughness will all conflict with the panel’s technology restrictions; therefore, this could cause a delay in the launch.”
* Some would say that it’s too early for Apple to introduce a new iPad in 2011. Providing that this report from overseas is accurate, it will probably be next year before we see the iPad 3.
