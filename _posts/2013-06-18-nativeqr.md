title: How to make the stock Camera app read QR codes

* I can probably count on one hand how many times I’ve used a QR Code reader over the years. The fact that such functionality isn’t built into iOS pretty much ensures that this tech will always be dead to me. Yet, a new jailbreak tweak is trying to change that by incorporating the ability to scan QR Codes directly from the stock Camera app. NativeQR is the name of the tweak, and not only will it allow you to scan QR codes, it also allows you to share contacts using QR codes as well.
* Once the tweak is installed, you can find its on/off toggle within the Camera app’s options panel — that’s the same panel where you’ll find things like Panorama mode and grid lines. After you enable NativeQR, using it is as simple as holding your viewfinder over a QR code. It only takes a second for NativeQR to recognize a code, and it responds with a dialogue that allows you to copy the link of the website corresponding to the code, or open the browser to go directly to the website.
* NativeQR’s ability to share contacts is impressive. Once the tweak is installed, you’ll find a new QR Code option next to the traditional share options. Sharing works pretty much exactly as you would expect, scan the code, and the traditional “add to contacts” page appears.
* NativeQR features no additional settings or options to configure. It’s a wonderful alternative to 3rd party QR code readers, and if you’re anything like me, it’ll increase the probability of you actually taking the time to scan a code when you come across one.
* For $1.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, NativeQR can be yours. Share your thoughts and comments about NativeQR and QR Codes below.
