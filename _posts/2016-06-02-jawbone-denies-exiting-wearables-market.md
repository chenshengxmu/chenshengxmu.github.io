* Following a Tech Insider report earlier this week claiming that accessory maker Jawbone had made the decision to sell its remaining inventory to a third-party reseller, stop building UP fitness trackers and create a clinical-grade health device, it’s issued a post to officially deny exiting the wearables business, putting a stop to “wrongful insinuations“.
* Entitled “We’re Still Committed”, the post advises against trusting “a few incorrect media reports” that said Jawbone was exiting the wearables business or even going as far as to suggest the company might be going out of business altogether.
* “These reports are unequivocally false,” writes the firm.
* “This speculation appears to emanate from wrongful insinuations made in a blog post in which the particular digital publication has since made a ‘Correction’”, the post reads.
* Jawbone has underscored that it wasn’t contacted on the “specific insinuations” prior to the Tech Insider story. Too late: the Internet echo chamber immediately picked up the original report before a correction was posted, giving the company a headache.
* Representatives for Jawbone provided the following comment three days after the Tech Insider story published:
* Jawbone has not ceased working on the production of UP products nor do we intend to. Each and every employee at Jawbone is currently focused on the design, development, marketing and production of either our current, or our next generation, UP wearables product line.
* They waited three days to issue a denial?
* “To be clear, Jawbone remains wholly committed to innovating in and building great wearables products. We have never been more excited about our pipeline of technology and products and look forward to sharing them with the world when ready,” it wrote.
* The UP2, UP3 and UP4 fitness bands “are still hugely popular and continue to sell well” and Jawbone will continue to support all of its products.
* The maker of wireless speakers and fitness-tracking bands has made a name for itself a decade ago with a lineup of high-quality Bluetooth headsets.
* Are you glad that Jawbone is still in the game?
