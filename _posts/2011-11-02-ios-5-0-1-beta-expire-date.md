* A couple hours ago, we reported that Apple was acknowledging problems with battery usage in iOS 5, leading the company to release iOS 5.0.1 beta to developers.
* If you are a developer who downloaded and installed the new beta release, you must know that this beta version will eventually expire, rendering your device useless if you haven’t updated to a newer firmware version…
* iOS hacker iH8Sn0w confirmed today on Twitter that iOS 5.0.1 beta will expire on December 14th, at 8pm EST. This leaves you more than enough time to update to the official iOS 5.0.1 release once it comes out.
