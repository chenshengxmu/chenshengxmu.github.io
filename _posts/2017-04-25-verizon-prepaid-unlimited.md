* Verizon on Tuesday announced that it’s launching a new unlimited data plan for its prepaid customers. Starting today you can activate the plan, which features unlimited data, talk and text, for $80 per month.
* “In just months, Verizon has transformed its prepaid offerings to make it easier and more affordable for customers to get access to the best network at a great value, no matter how much data they need,” said Tami Erwin, executive vice president of operations for Verizon. “This plan is all about giving our prepaid customers more choice. With data plans from as little as 2 GB to unlimited data, we’ve got a plan that fits your needs.”
* In addition to the 2GB and unlimited plans, Verizon offers a 5GB plan for $50 and a 10GB plan for $70. Each of these plans include Always-On Data, international text to over 200 countries, and CarryOver data.
* Today’s news comes less than a week after Verizon announced it lost nearly 300,000 postpaid subscribers during its first quarter. The carrier pointed to its lack of unlimited offerings as the biggest factor in the slide.
