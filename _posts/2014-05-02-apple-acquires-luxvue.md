* Apple has acquired LuxVue Technology, a company that makes low-power displays for mobile electronics, according to TechCrunch. Citing sources close to the transaction, the site reports that the iPad-maker has added LuxVue to its hardware innovations team.
* Little is known about the deal, and even less is known about the company. Other than its big $43 million in funding, LuxVue has managed to fly under the radar. Patents reveal, however, that it specializes in micro-LED tech that could be used in future iOS devices…
* Here’s the report from TechCrunch:
* Apple has acquired LuxVue Technology, a stealthy company that had been working on micro-LED, screen technologies, we’ve heard from sources close to the transaction. The company had raised $43 million in funding from Kleiner Perkins, iD Ventures America and others.
* LuxVue had managed to remain fairly quiet over the past few years, and what we know is that the company develops low-power, micro-LED-based displays for consumer electronics. We’ve heard Apple acquired the company to add to their hardware innovations area.
* And here’s an excerpt from a previous TC report on the company:
* He said the company has invested in another stealth company called Luxvue that he claims has a technical breakthrough in displays. He explained that displays waste a lot of energy and a more efficient display would waste far less battery power. 
* Apple has confirmed the acquisition with the site by offering up its boilerplate statement: ‘Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.’ It’s not known, however, when the deal was completed.
* During the company’s earnings call last week, Tim Cook announced that Apple has acquired 24 companies in the last 18 months. He noted that it’s not in a race to spend the most or acquire the most, but “in a race to make the best products that enrich people’s lives.”
* Other recently-reported Apple acquisitions include speech recognition firm Novauris, testing platform developer Burstly, and burst photo app-maker SnappyLabs.
