* Apple on Wednesday issued the first beta for iOS 10.1. Registered developers can grab the new software via the over-the-air update mechanism in the iOS Settings app, or via Apple’s online developer portal.
* Perhaps the most significant change in this first 10.1 beta is the addition of Portrait camera mode— a software feature for the iPhone 7 Plus Apple showed off earlier this month that creates a ‘bokeh’ effect.
* Here’s an example of what a photo taken in Portrait mode looks like:

* TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino has a great breakdown of how it works:
* The Portrait mode, which displays a beta notification prominently on first launch, resides to the right side of the standard photo mode in your camera app. There is no zooming, digital or otherwise, in Portrait mode. Instead, the Portrait mode exclusively uses the 56mm lens to shoot the image and the wide angle lens to gather the perspective data that allows it to generate a 9-layer depth map.
* Outside of this new feature, Apple’s release notes only mention vague “bug fixes and improvements.” We are installing the iOS 10.1 beta now, and will be sure to update this article with any significant new findings.
