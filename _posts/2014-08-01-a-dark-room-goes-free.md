* This is a heads up for all of you gamers looking to try out something new this weekend. Developer Amirali Rajan has discounted his chart-topping RPG title ‘A Dark Room‘ down to $0 for a limited time, as he prepares to launch its upcoming prequel.
* For those who haven’t played the game before, it’s a little tough to explain. There’s just a single screenshot of it in the App Store, and almost no backstory. It’s text-based, with some RPG elements—it’s one of those things you have to see for yourself…
* This is usually where we offer an overview of a game’s storyline, and some of its features, but again Rajan provides none of that. Upon launching ‘A Dark Room,’ players are thrust into action with no instructions. ‘awake. head throbbing. vision blurry.’
* From here you begin making choices of what your character’s next action will be. Each decision impacts what happens next in the story, and you are given more options the deeper you go. There are no graphics. At all. It has a very early-PC feel to it.
* Here’s a video walkthrough, but I don’t recommend watching it before trying the game:
* Even if you’re not a fan of this type of game, I recommend checking it out. With a 4.5 star rating, on nearly 14,000 reviews, there has to be something to it. Plus it’s normally $4. If you’re interested, you can find A Dark Room in the App Store for free.
* Thanks Ares!
