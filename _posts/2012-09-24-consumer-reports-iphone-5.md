* Consumer Reports is an 80+ year-old American magazine that publishes reviews and opinions on new consumer products and services. It’s physical publication has more than 7 million monthly subscribers and is highly regarded among shoppers.
* The magazine has quite a history with Apple, once giving the iPhone 4 a “cannot recommend status,” back in 2010, and then sensationalizing the iPad 3’s overheating issue earlier this year. But as it turns out, it actually really likes the iPhone 5…
* From Consumer Reports’ iPhone 5 review:
* “The iPhone 5 fulfills its promise as a notable improvement over its fine predecessor, the iPhone 4S, and belongs in the first rank of smart phones…
* … By boosting screen size, thinning its profile, and adding 4G LTE access, among other features, his newest iPhone shows every sign of being the most compelling yet.”
* But the review wasn’t completely glowing. It pointed out — what else — the new Maps application in iOS 6 as a caveat. CR’s Car team, which reviews all kinds of navigation devices, said the app lacked functionality and suffered from gaps in maps data.
* Of course, we already knew that the new Maps app paled in comparison to other GPS applications. Apple’s only been working on it for a few years, at best, and even CR was quick to point out that the service was beta-like, and “likely to improve over time.”
* And it doesn’t appear to be bothering consumers at all. Earlier today, Apple announced that it had sold 5 million iPhone 5’s during its opening weekend — a new record for the company.
