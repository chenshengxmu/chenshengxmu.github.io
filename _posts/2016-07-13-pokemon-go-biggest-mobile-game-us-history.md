* The runaway success of Nintendo’s Pokémon GO continues to take the Internet by storm, with a new Survey Monkey study indicating that in terms of daily active users the augmented-reality title has officially become the biggest mobile game in the United States’s history, just a week following its launch on iOS and Android. After initially launching in the United States, New Zealand and Australia, Pokémon GO is now available on the German App Store ahead of its expected launch across Europe.
* Pokémon GO draws more daily active users than such smash hits as Clash Royale.
* During its first 24 hours of availability, the game had more daily active users than Slither.io and Clash Royale. Days later, Pokémon GO amassed 21 million daily active users, overtaking King’s insanely popular Candy Crush Saga.

* At its peak, Candy Crush Saga claimed 20 million players in the United States each day, or 93 million daily active users around the world. The strong numbers for Nintendo, Niantic and Pokémon Company’s latest mobile title prompted Survey Monkeys to call Pokémon GO “the biggest mobile game in US history.”

* “Plus, as unbelievable as it sounds, Pokémon GO Android could surpass Google Maps itself as the largest user of Alphabet’s mapping data,” said the company.
* Yesterday’s update squashed numerous bugs while fixing an issue with the app requiring full Google Account access, although some Reddit users are now complaining that the new version prevents them from signing into the app via a Pokemon Trainer Club account.
* According to the PokéSteal fan page on Twitter, additional virtual reality features could be in the works in the form of Google Cardboard support.
* Pokémon GO is a free download from the United States, New Zealand, Australian and German App Stores and contains optional In-App Purchases ranging from $0.99 to $99.
