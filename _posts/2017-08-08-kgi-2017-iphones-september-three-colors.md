* Backtracking from his earlier claim that iPhone 8 might offer fewer casing colors to “maintain its boutique image,” respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities is now saying that all three iPhone models slated for release this year will come in only three color options—Black, Silver and Gold—and launch simultaneously in September.
* According to his note to clients, obtained by MacRumors, Apple will kick off mass production of the OLED iPhone model in mid-September, not in late-October as previously reported.
* Kuo speculated earlier that iPhone 8 could get delayed until October or November.
* Still, the device is expected to be in short supply, at least initially, with only two to four million units expected to be available during the third quarter of the year.

* Kuo basically shot down the rumor calling for a copper-like hue for iPhone 8.
* All three models—iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8—should support fast charging.
* He speculates users may need to purchase a USB-C Lightning cable and power adapter to use this feature. He stopped short of predicting whether or not all three 2017 iPhone models might support wireless charging and if this feature would require a standalone charging accessory.
* An excerpt from the note:
* The OLED version will be in short supply as we forecast shipments in the third quarter of 2017 will be 2-4 million units or less. We do not think production of the OLED iPhone will pick up substantially before the fourth quarter; and given strong demand, tight supply may persist until the first quarter of 2018 before improving much.
* Expecting a boost in iPhone 8 production in the Christmas quarter, the analyst has projected that model to move between 45 and 50 million units before 2017 wraps up.
* As for the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus updates, he’s expecting sales of 35-38 million units for the former and between 18-20 million units for the latter.
