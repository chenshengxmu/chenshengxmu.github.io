* You’ve probably read stories by DigiTimes and 9to5Mac, which were seemingly corroborated by today’s analyst report and an earlier blurry photo, that the iPhone 7 would supposedly have a Home button that would sit flush with the face of the phone.
* A UK-based conceptual artist took those rumors as a base for imagining a possible design for the next iPhone’s Home button. He also envisioned a rumored Space Black finish for the device that should resemble the Space Black Apple Watch.
* A non-moving, all-digital, touch-sensitive Home button on the iPhone 7 would reportedly use various tapping gestures to replace hard presses for features like getting back to the Home screen, invoking the app switcher, using Reachability and more.
* I’ve had my iPhone 6s replaced twice by Apple in a span of just a few short months due to a faulty Home button. Removing the mechanical components from the Home button’s design would make these issues a thing of the past.
* And here’s his take on the rumored Space Black colorway for the next iPhone.

* Japanese blog Mac Otakara thinks the iPhone 7 will come in a dark variant resembling the Space Black Apple Watch finish. I’d buy it in a heartbeat because I was a big fan of that Darth Vader-like black iPhone 5 design, scuffs and dings be damned!
* Seen below: a future iPhone utilizing the rumored glass on the front and back design.

* I like the idea all-glass iPhone even though the iPhone 4s, which was sandwiched between two panes of glass, broke easily if dropped. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a research note to clients that the iPhone 7 would ditch the all-metal appearance in favor of an all-glass enclosure.

* Are you looking forward to the iPhone 7? Will the upcoming handset look more refined and different from the current iPhone 6/6s design, do you think?
