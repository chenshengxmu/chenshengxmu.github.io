* Waze, the popular social-mapping location data startup, today pushed a major update to its GPS, maps and social traffic application in the App Store.
* Featuring a refreshed design and cleaner maps with emphasis on safer driving, the new Waze 4.0 for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad also brings reduced battery consumption allowing the app to run longer in the background, and much more.
* Waze 4.0 minimizes the number of taps it takes to start navigating. The app’s map, menus and road reporting system are all less cluttered than before and revamped for higher visibility and clarity.
* You’ll notice brighter buttons and color-coded pins per report type. Waze’s reporting and sharing features have been simplified as well. Check out a quick video overview of the new features in Waze’s promotional video seen below.
* If you don’t see the embedded video, watch it on YouTube.
* “Tapping the left button pulls up the navigation menu and all of your frequent and favorite destinations,” explains Waze.
* “Meanwhile, tapping the right button gives you quick access to your contacts for a number of actions including: Sending directions, your location, and ETA to those awaiting your arrival.”
* Waze 4.0 makes it easier to access alternate routes, add a stop or let someone know you’re on the way from the center button where your ETA time is displayed.

* An easier way of reporting traffic incidents is now available from the map, by tapping a big orange button. Or, tap and hold down the report menu for a quick report action.
* Waze now supports reminders to leave for events on time, provided you give Waze permission to access iOS’s Calendar. These reminders take into account current traffic conditions. And like before, you can still get timely updates about speed traps, construction and accidents in real-time.
* The following changes are mentioned in release notes:
* Google bought Waze in June 2013 for an estimated $1.3 billion.
* Waze is available free in the App Store, without ads or In-App Purchases.
* The app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later. Waze lacks a native app for the Apple Watch and does not support 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus as of yet.
* The app is localized in English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Bokmål, Norwegian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese and Turkish.
* Grab Waze free of charge in the App Store.
