* Apple last month unveiled a sixth-generation 9.7-inch iPad with full support for the company’s Pencil stylus, and now they’ve created four nice ads promoting the refreshed tablet.
* Released last evening through Apple United Kingdom’s official YouTube channel, these watchable commercials focus on some of the best third-party apps with Apple Pencil support.
* TIP: Editing iOS screenshots with Instant Markup tools
* The promoted pieces of software include Tayasui Sketches Pro for drawing on photos, the note-taking and sketching app Notability and Apple’s own presentation app Keynote which recently picked up Apple Pencil support as part of a major iWork suit refresh.
* iOS 11’s system-wide annotation tools are heavily featured in one of the ads.
