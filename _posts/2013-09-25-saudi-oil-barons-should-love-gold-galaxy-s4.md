* It’s not surprising the slightest bit that gold colorway is becoming all the rage in cellphones. That’s almost single-handedly due to Apple offering its flagship iPhone 5s in gold, in addition to silver and space gray finishes.
* Somewhat surprising: Samsung following in Apple’s footsteps by offering the flagship Galaxy S4 in gold – after the fact. “Elegance is a touch of gold,” reads Samsung’s tagline for a phone “style that’s uniquely yours”.
* Fast follower, indeed…
* The South Korean conglomerate is now offering the Galaxy S4 in two gold colorways: Gold Pink and Gold Brown. It’s unclear whether Samsung will sell these new handset variants internationally as it shared these shots on its Middle East Twitter channel and Facebook page.
* Here’s another look at it.

* Strange they aren’t showing off the device’s gold plated backside, no?
* At any rate, Saudi oil barons should love these.
* Just for the record: Samsung has done gold devices a few times before, just as Apple’s been building colorful mobile devices for quite a few years and dating way back to the colorful iPods and the original iMac.
* Samsung also said it will build a phone with 64-bit processor some time in 2014.
* On a somewhat related note, the company at today’s Galaxy Gear smartwatch launch event in Seoul announced it will be releasing a new mobile phone with a curved screen in October.
* Can you say Galaxy S4 Curve?
