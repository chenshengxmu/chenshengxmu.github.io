* Nutshell Camera from the team at Prezi should probably be the latest addition to your iPhone photography arsenal.
* Available free in the App Store, it’s really easy to use. Just pick three photos from your Camera roll, add some fun captions and graphics and let Nutshell do its magic. The app will map your photos to video, creating an instantly shareable cinematic story.
* Your visual vignettes can be shared with the web at large by posting them to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram or sent to via SMS, email, WhatsApp and more.
* The app’s story mapping technology marries the simplicity of photographs to the spatial context of video and the fun of animated graphics.
* “Nutshell Camera opens the door for all sorts of unique messaging opportunities when videos feel like too much of a production and plain photos just aren’t adequate for capturing life’s moments,” developers argue.
* Nutshell features full camera support for iOS 8 and comes with a library of free animated graphics that can be used to boost your storytelling.
* If you’re a photography buff, give Nutshell a whirl. You can’t go wrong as the app is available at no cost and does not contain In-App Purchases.
* The iPhone-only app weighs in at 132MB and requires iOS 8.0 or later.
* Download Nutshell for iPhone for free in the App Store.
