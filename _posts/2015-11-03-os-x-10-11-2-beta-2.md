* In addition to iOS 9.2 beta 2 and tvOS 9.1 beta 1, members of the Apple Developer Program can also download OS X 10.11.2 beta 2 (build number 15C31f).
* Arriving a week after the first beta of OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 hit, the new software is now available to download on Macs with a previous beta through the Mac App Store’s Software Update mechanism, or as a standalone download via Apple’s portal for developers.
* According to the official release notes, this pre-release version of what will become the second major software update for El Capitan does not introduce any new user-facing features. Instead, Apple is asking developers to focus on issues with graphics, Mail, Wi-Fi, Calendar, USB, Notes, Photos, Spotlight and networking.
* “The OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac,” the changelog states.
* We’ll be updating this article with other changes as we encounter them.
