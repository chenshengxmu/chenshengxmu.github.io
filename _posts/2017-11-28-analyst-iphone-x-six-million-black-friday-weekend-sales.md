* Even though AirPods and iPads topped the list for most popular gadgets during Cyber Monday, Apple sold some crazy amounts of the new iPhone X as well.
* StreetInsider today quoted today Rosenblatt China Technology analyst Jun Zhang as saying that the Cupertino technology giant was able to move an estimated six million iPhone X units during the kickoff holiday shopping weekend. Not only did Apple sell incredible amounts of the latest iPhone, it did so while improving shipping times as well.
* This leads further credence to the report detailing that the improved shipping time for iPhone X was a result of production increases, not waining demand. StreetInsider reiterated that fact, saying iPhone X production was “ahead of schedule.”
* Zhang noted that the 256GB iPhone X was proving to be twice as popular as the 64GB version.
* As a result of these stellar sales and increased production rates, Zhang lowered his expectations for the upcoming quarters as more sales have moved into the December quarter.
* Now that shipping times have improved significantly, have you been able to get your hands on an iPhone X?
* Tell us in comments!
