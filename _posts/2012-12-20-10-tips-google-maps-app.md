* Google Maps made its triumphant return to iOS last week, and there’s no question that it’s a massive hit. It saw 10 million downloads in its first 48 hours, and it’s still the #1 free app in the App Store.
* For those of you who haven’t tried Google Maps yet, or haven’t figured what all of the commotion is about, Google today published a list of 10 tips that will help you get the most out of the software…
* From the Google Maps website help section:
* 1. Place Pin on the Map – To drop a pin, simply press and hold any location on the map. Tap the resulting info sheet for additional options such as saving the location or accessing Street View (if available).
* 2. Street View – To see panoramic Street View images, press and hold any location on the map, tap the info sheet, and then tap the image. Explore as if you’re there by tapping the look-around icon (on the bottom left) and moving or tilting your phone.
* 3. Shake to Send Feedback – Help us improve the map and our application. If you find something that needs to be updated (like a closed road or a business that has moved) or if you have suggestions, just give your iPhone a shake and send us feedback.
* 4. Swipe to See More – Whether searching or getting directions, swipe the info sheet to the left or right to browse additional results. Find one you like? Tap it or swipe it up to see more details (e.g. a business’ hours or transit stops).
* 5. Access Views – Satellite, traffic and public transit views are easy to access by tapping the three dots at the bottom right or by swiping from right to left with two fingers.
* 6. Preview steps in Navigation (Beta) – In Navigation (Beta) mode, preview the upcoming route by swiping the top bar to the left (tap Resume to return to the start). Tap the bottom bar to switch between your estimated travel time and the remaining miles.
* 7. 1 Finger Zoom – To zoom in and out with one finger, double-tap a location, hold the second tap, and drag your finger up or down.
* 8. Work & Home – Get home or get to work quickly by saving these locations. Tap the My profile button (next to the search box) to save them across all your devices.
* 9. Compass Mode – Reading the map is easier when it’s facing the same direction you are facing. Use compass mode to orient yourself by tapping on the My location button twice on the bottom left of your screen.
* 10. Save a Place – Save your favorite places to get quick access. Saved places sync across all of your devices and will appear on the map and on your search results. To save a place tap the star icon on a location or place info sheet.
* Obviously, there’s a good chance you’ve already figured out most of this stuff on your own. But for those who haven’t, this is surely helpful. If you’re interested, Google has demos and more information on these tips on its website.
