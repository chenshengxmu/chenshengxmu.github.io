* Uber-popular jailbreak tweak Springtomize 3 was provided with a nice little update today. Even though Filippo Bigarella has handed over the development reigns to another developer, the tweak is still receiving new features, which is a great sign for Springtomize fans.
* Today’s update, while not containing anything groundbreaking, brings several new niceties to the table. Additions include the ability to display seconds in the status bar, colorize the Lock screen time and date, and more.

* One of the brand new features
* This latest update brings Springtomize 3 to version 1.4. Here are all of the changes that you can expect to see once the new version is installed on your jailbroken device:
* Springtomize 3 version 1.4 is a free update, and is compatible with iOS 7, iOS 8, and most recently, iOS 9. Original developer Filippo Bigarella, who has stepped back from the jailbreak scene, placed most of the tweak’s maintenance and updates on new developer Janosch Hubner. Hubner has been doing a good job with updates, especially the iOS 9 update, which no doubt required a lot of work to ensure compatibility.
