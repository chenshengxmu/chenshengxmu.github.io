* Pangu for the Mac was just released today, and it brings with it the ability to jailbreak iOS 7.1.x untethered. The Windows version, which was released last week to much fanfare, has already allowed many people to enjoy the fruits of jailbreaking iOS.
* I think it’s safe to say that the Mac version has been highly anticipated since word of Pangu first hit the Internet. For those of you who remained patient, your patience has paid off. You can now jailbreak iOS 7.1 and iOS 7.1.1 using your Mac. Check our our full video walkthrough inside for all of the details.
* The Pangu jailbreak should work with the following devices: iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPod touch 5th gen, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina Display.
* Step 1: Download the latest version of Pangu for Mac OS X from our downloads page

* Step 3: Open Pangu.dmg on your Mac and double click the Pangu icon to run the app
* Step 4: Once your device is detected by the app, click the Start Jailbreak button
* Step 5: Pangu will ask you to go to Settings > General > Date & Time and disable the Set Automatically toggle. You will then need to set the date to June 2, 2014
* Step 6: Once the date is set, the jailbreak process will start automatically. Eventually Pangu will ask you to open the Pangu app icon on the Home screen. Tap the Pangu icon to launch the Pangu app and tap the Continue button
* Step 7: Wait patiently, and the jailbreak will continue process. You will be asked to unlock your device after it reboots
* Step 8: Once the jailbreak is completed, you should see Cydia on your Home screen
