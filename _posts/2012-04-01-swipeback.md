* SwipeBack is a brand new jailbreak tweak from Ryan Petrich that allows you to navigate back within apps using a simple swipe from left to right.
* Although the tweak isn’t available on any public repos, and is still relegated to beta status, I can confirm that it works quite well.
* Check inside for the download details, and a brief video demonstration of SwipeBack in action…
* SwipeBack can be found on Ryan’s beta repository. Simply add the following to your Cydia sources: http://rpetri.ch/repo/
* Once you add the beta repo, you can download SwipeBack, along with a few other tweaks that we’ve already covered on iDB. What’s even better is that all of the downloads are free of charge.
* What do you think about SwipeBack?
