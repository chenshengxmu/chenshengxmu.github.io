* Amazon’s free Kindle for iOS app has received a refresh this morning. Bumped to version 4.7, it lets students access Kindle eTextbooks from their iPhone and filter their notes by chapter for easy studying, thanks to an enhanced Notebook feature.
* Book Browser, another new feature created with iPhone owners in mind, lets you tap on a book cover to reveal additional information like the book description and customer reviews.
* And if you’re a comics fan, browsing your favorite comic book is now a lot easier thanks to the new table of contents, accessible from the left panel navigation menu.
* The table of contents lists chapter headings and page numbers. Amazon cautions that “most”, but not all, comic books have table of contents implemented in the Kindle app.
* Kindle 4.7 changelog:
* Back in December, the Book Browser made its debut in Kindle for iPad, as did other features like Goodreads integration, progressive playback of Audible audiobooks and more.
* The online retail giant should be credit for being among the first developers that refreshed the Kindle app with support for the new iPhone resolutions and iOS 8 back in September 2014, including a handy Kindle widget in the Today section of the iOS Notification Center.
* And last month, Amazon released a free OS X app giving Mac owners the tools to create and publish their own textbooks on Kindle.
* The 48.70 megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Kindle for the iPhone and iPad at no cost from the App Store.
