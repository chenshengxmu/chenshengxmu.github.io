* Accessory maker Logitech on Wednesday announced a new rugged case for Apple’s iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s featuring sleek appearance and offering shock absorption and protection from drops of up to six feet (works out to about 1.8 meters).
* In addition, the company introduced the +Trip accessory for mounting an iPhone or just about any other smartphone to your car’s air vents. The Protection+ case works with Logitec’s new +Drive and +Trip attachments that let you affix your iPhone to a car’s windshield or dashboard using built-in suction cup…
* The Protection+ case has a hard polycarbonate body and uses impact-resistant polymers in the corners to dissipate the energy of the impact across the surface of the case.
* Additionally, the impact channels and a layer of thermoplastic rubber inside the polycarbonate shell work together to further absorb vibrations.

* Logitech notes that the case exceeds the U.S. Military drop-test standard (MIL-STD 810 G) for rugged devices, meaning it protects your device from drops up to 1.8 meters high.

* A hidden metal plate inside the case works with magnets in Logitech’s smartphone mounts, including the new +Drive and +Trip accessories, pictured above.
* Both the original +Drive and the new +Trip are designed “to seamlessly hold any smartphone or case vertically or horizontally,” according to Logitech.
* The +Trip mount includes two universal adapters, so it’s compatible with smartphones of all shapes and sizes, as well as with Logitech’s other Case+ attachments.
* Speaking of which, here’s Case+ that Logitech unveiled in May.
* The $34.99 Protection+ case ,along with the $49.99 +Drive and $29.99 +Trip accessories, is scheduled to launch next month in the United States and Europe, available in Winter White, Gunmetal Black, Scarlett Plum and Pacific Blue.
