* Twitter is rolling out a new option to ease the use of direct messages. Traditionally, the social network has only allowed users who follow each other to send direct messages back and forth to one another.
* But with this new setting, which apparently began rolling out last week, Twitter users can elect to receive direct messages from any follower, regardless of whether or not they’re following the person back…
* The new option was first spotted by marketing guru Jim Connolly (via Pocket-Lint):
* You can now receive DM’s from anyone who follows you, without you following them. Just saw this in settings… pic.twitter.com/Lsf0FR563q

* After checking my account, I can confirm that I now have this option. But I’m still not sure whether or not to check the box. It seems like DMs are better suited for personal use, and @ replies for everything else.
* That being said, I can see how this could benefit brands and companies who want to contact customers regarding contests, or customer service issues. It would allow them to communicate privately with users.

* If you’re not sure whether you’ve received the feature or not, simply visit Twitter.com, login and visit the ‘Account’ tab (located in Settings panel). You should see it a little more than halfway down the menu.
* For those that don’t see it yet, be patient, it sounds like Twitter is rolling out the option in phases. And there’s no word yet on when it will make its way into the official mobile application or 3rd-party apps.
