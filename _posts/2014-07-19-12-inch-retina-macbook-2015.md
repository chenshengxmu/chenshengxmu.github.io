* Taiwan’s Economic Daily News is reporting tonight that the launch of the 12-inch MacBook with Retina display may be pushed back due to Intel processor delays. The long-rumored hybrid laptop was expected to finally launch later this year.
* The problem is, the new MacBook, said to strike a better balance of performance and portability, is believed to be tied to Intel’s 14-nanometer Broadwell chips. These chips have been delayed several times, and now may not land until 2015…
* Here’s more from the Economic Daily report (via Google Translate):
* Apple (Apple) is expected to launch this year’s 12-inch pen motor types, and featuring the retina (Retina) display technology, and Intel’s latest 14-nanometer processor Broadwell, however, the recent market spread, due to insufficient supply of Intel chips, the new machine listed schedule, it may delayed until the end of the third quarter or early next year.
* The 12-inch Retina MacBook rumors first popped up last year, and the theory has since been rehashed by several publications and analysts. The well respected Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities reported earlier that it could launch as soon as mid-2014.
* Kuo said that the 12-inch Air would combine the portability of the 11-inch model, with the productivity of the 13-inch, and house a beautiful hi-res display. He also said it would feature a slimmer, lighter design, with a button-less trackpad and no fan.
* In a separate, but somewhat-related report, the Economic Daily News says that refreshed 11 and 13-inch MacBook Airs will not be delayed, and should go into production next month. The new models will feature new chips, screens, chassis and more.
