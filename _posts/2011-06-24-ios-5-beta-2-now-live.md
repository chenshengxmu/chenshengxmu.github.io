* Apple has just released the second beta for iOS 5. Beta 2 is now available for download in Apple’s developer channel.
* iOS 5 Beta is a 740MB download and available for all Apple devices from the 3rd gen iPod touch and up.
* You must have iTunes beta 10.5 in order to sync with iOS 5 beta 2. It can be assumed that the iOS 5 Beta 1 jailbreak is now broken in Beta 2 , so be cautious when deciding to upgrade. Otherwise, head over to the iOS Dev Center and get downloading!
* UPDATE: iOS 5 Beta 2 can actually be jailbroken with RedSn0w! Cheers, jailbreakers!
