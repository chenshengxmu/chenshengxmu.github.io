* Originally scheduled for November, the official Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson will launch a month early, on October 24. Just like we had reported back in June, this biography will cover the details of his resignation and get Steve’s insights both before and after that day.
* Pre-orders for the biography have skyrocketed by some 40,000%+ since yesterday and the book is now one of the top sellers on both Amazon and iTunes…
* You can pre-order your copy today for $17.88.
