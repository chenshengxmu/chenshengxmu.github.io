* Although the iPhone 4 was already 7 months old when it launched on the Verizon network, Apple still went to great lengths to keep the CDMA version of the device a secret. Learning from its mistakes it made with the iPhone 4 prototype last year, Apple set strict rules and implemented tight security measures to ensure it didn’t happen again.
* Verizon staff weren’t authorized to field test the device until just two weeks before its launch, after signing non-disclosure agreements promising they wouldn’t let details slip. Those entrusted to test the device weren’t allowed to call it an “iPhone” – it was given the code-name “ACME” and that’s what it had to be called…
* Then there’s the security: According to a source who revealed these details to TechnoBuffalo, Apple set up a unique security protocol that required Verizon testers to text a secret PIN code to a dedicated number every 12 hours. If they failed to do this, the handset was bricked and had no functionality.
* Apple staff, however, were allowed to test the device 6 months before its launch – just after the release of the GSM iPhone 4 – but only within Apple Stores. Even when Verizon staff were allowed to test the device themselves, only select staff high up on the ladder were given the privilege – the vast majority were kept in the dark and knew nothing more than the general public.
* I find it fascinating that Apple went to such great lengths to ensure another version of the iPhone 4 – which is only slightly different aesthetically on the outside – wouldn’t be leaked before its launch. With such secrecy over a 7-month-old device, can you imagine the steps Apple will/must be taking with the iPhone 5? Will it self-destruct if you don’t report back to Steve himself once every 30 minutes?
