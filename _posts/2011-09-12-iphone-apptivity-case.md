* There are good ideas in this world, and then there are bad ideas. Giving your $650 iPhone to a young child has to rank amongst one of the worst ideas we’ve heard of for a long while, but that’s exactly what Fisher Price wants us to do. The toy company has created a handy-dandy little iPhone case for that exact purpose.
* Dubbed the “Laugh and Learn Apptivity Case” and set to go on sale next month, the case protects your iPhone or iPod touch while a 6-36 month-old child does its best to eat it, drool on it, or do other generally bad things to it…
* Once inserted, the iDevice is nigh-on impossible to remove without a coin or similar tool, and the front is covered with a protective plastic. Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on how you look at it), the power, volume and home button are not accessible once the device is in the case.
* Fisher Price has even created three apps that they believe will keep your child entertained, at least until someone calls you on your newly baby-fied iPhone.
* At $15, the Apptivity Case sure is cheaper than buying a new iPhone or iPod touch. But surely there are other, less expensive toys to give a baby?
* Perhaps some sort of Android phone?
