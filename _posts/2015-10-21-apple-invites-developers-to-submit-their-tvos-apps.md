* Following the release of the tvOS Golden Master earlier today, Apple is now inviting developers to begin submitting their app submissions for the new Apple TV, which should be available by the end of next.
* An email sent to developer reads:
* The App Store for the new Apple TV will soon be available to customers around the world. To prepare, build your apps and games using Xcode 7.1 GM, which includes the tvOS SDK, and test them on tvOS GM seed.
* The email links to the  Apple Developer Center where the company offers an overview of the requirements as well as basic guidance for submitting tvOS apps.
* In an interview at the WSJDLive conference on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook casually announced that the new Apple TV will be available for order on Monday, October 26, and will ship by the end of next week, giving Apple about 8 days to approve tvOS apps.
* This leaves plenty of time for Apple to approve apps for this new platform that its made available to developers.
