* According to a brief report in the Chinese-language Economic Daily Times newspaper that was quoted Friday by DigiTimes, strong sales of the W1-enhanced AirPods and robust demand for Apple’s earphones during the year-end holidays have prompted supplier Inventec to increase production capacity. While Inventec declined to comment on its orders, it’s reportedly begun expanding capacity at its Shanghai plants, which are currently working overtime to deliver orders.
* Tim Cook briefly commented on AirPods yesterday as he toured the floor of the New York Stock Exchange while on vacation. He called them “a runaway success” although that means nothing, really, without any data or sales figures.
* “AirPods are a runaway success, and we’re making them as fast as we can,” Cook said.
* Apple’s webstore currently lists AirPods with a six-week wait so it’s nice that Inventec is expanding capacity as that means wait times may be shortened sooner rather than later.
* AirPods are also available with Apple’s in-store pickup option.
