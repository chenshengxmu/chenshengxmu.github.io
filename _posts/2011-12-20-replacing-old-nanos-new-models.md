* Apple’s iPod nano replacement program is in full swing now, with the company replacing original iPod nanos due to a potential fire risk from overheating. Up to this point, Apple has been replacing the iPods with same-generation models, with new versions of old iPod nanos being shipped out to the customers that are taking advantage of the program.
* Now it seems that Apple may have begun to offer new, recent-generation models of the iPod nano in exchange for the faulty first-generation units, if reports on the MacRumors forums are to be believed.
* At least one user has reported that a new, 6th-generation iPod nano has arrived in replacement of the old model, and after checking the serial number for AppleCare he was informed that it has expired. This, we suspect, points to the devices being refurbished models.
* Still, refurb or not, nobody is going to turn down a free, current-generation iPod nano, are they?
* We can only assume that Apple has finally run out of first-generation units, and is now fulfilling replacement orders with whatever it has on hand. If you have just received a first-generation model, don’t be too disappointed – everyone knows they were the best looking iPod nanos to date!
* Have you received a replacement iPod nano recently?
