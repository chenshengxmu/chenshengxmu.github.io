* Two weeks after hitting precisely two-thirds of active iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices in the wild, Apple’s latest iOS 9 mobile operating system is now powering 67 percent of iOS hardware.
* The data comes via Apple’s dashboard for developers and is derived from App Store access logs on Tuesday, November 16, 2015. iOS 8 continues to comprise just shy of one-quarter of active iOS devices in use, while earlier iOS editions collectively account for nine percent of iOS devices being actively used.
* The official numbers for iOS 8 are down one percentage point compared to the last check two weeks ago while stats for the ‘Earlier’ have remained unchanged from the previous adoption rate update.
* In other words, the one-point gain for iOS 9 adoption achieved over the past two weeks has come at the expense of iOS 8 as users continue to upgrade to Apple’s latest and greatest mobile operating system.
* Also, some (much?) of the growth exhibited by iOS 9 should be attributed to new iOS device purchases, which come with iOS 9 preinstalled.
