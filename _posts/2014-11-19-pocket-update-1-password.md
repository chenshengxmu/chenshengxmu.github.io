* Popular read-it-later service Pocket pushed out a notable update for its iOS client today, bringing the app to version 5.6.2. The update includes a number of improvements, including support for Dynamic Type and the 1Password extension.
* The addition of Dynamic Type support means that text in Pocket will now reflect whatever you have set as your system font size preference. And of course 1Password extension support means users can now login to Pocket with Touch ID.
* Rounding out today’s update is your standard array of bug fixes, as well as a batch of “significant improvements” to the Share Extension, which Pocket says will make saving content on any type of connection—including offline—lightning fast.
* Pocket has long been my go-to read-it-later service due to its beautiful design, reliable syncing, and cross-platform support. If you haven’t ever looked into it, or it’s been a while, I recommend grabbing the latest version from the App Store for free.
* Note: you will need the 1Password app and iOS 8 to take advantage of these new features.
