* Whether you use it or not, the Fandango Movies app for iOS is a fairly big deal. Not only does it offer up movie info and trailers, but it also facilitates theater ticket purchases. In fact, you can start the process with Siri, as Fandango is deeply integrated into the assistant.
* Anyway, the app got a major makeover this morning, with the release of Fandango 6.0. You’ll notice the visual changes right away—particularly in movie pages, theater lists—as well as the all-new ratings system, spotlight carousel, and a number of other enhancements…
* Here’s your full 6.0 change log:
* We’ve made your Fandango mobile experience even more exciting. Check out our latest updates: • The Spotlight carousel now available for both iPhone and iPad! • Our brand new look features visual enhancements to movie pages, theater lists, as well as a new rating system and easy-to-spot ticketing information icons • Sign in to your Fandango account using Facebook or Google+ (iPhone only; iPad coming soon). Don’t have an account yet? Create one now for one-tap purchases and to save your favorite theaters.
* I frequently use the app to purchase my movie tickets, as most theaters support Fandango’s will-call service and the app supports Passbook. So honestly, it’s just a bonus that you can also use it to watch movie trailers, read critic and consumer reviews and locate movie theaters.

* If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I recommend doing so. You can find the latest version of Fandango in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free. There are, of course, alternatives like Flixter and iTunes Movie Trailers, but Fandango for me has pulled ahead.
