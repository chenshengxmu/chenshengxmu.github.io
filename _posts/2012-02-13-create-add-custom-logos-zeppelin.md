* I don’t think anyone foresaw how popular Zeppelin would become in the jailbreak community, but there are tons of custom logo packs available, and more being made each day.
* What if you wanted to create your own custom logo pack? How would you go about adding the Zeppelin logos to your iDevice manually without going through Cydia?
* This tutorial seeks to answer that question, along with providing you with our very own custom iDB carrier logo pack!
* To add a custom logo pack to your iDevice, simply do the following:
* Step 1: FTP into your device
* Step 2: Navigate to /Library/Zeppelin/
* Step 3: Drop your logo pack folder inside the Zeppelin directory
* Step 4: Open the settings panel for Zeppelin on your device, and select the name of your custom logo pack. You may need to respring first.
* As you can see, it’s very easy to drag and drop your own custom logo packs. As a matter of fact, why not download our official iDB logo pack, and show your love for iDB?
* Leave a comment below with a link to your device with an iDB custom logo, and your device may be featured in an upcoming video! What do you say?
