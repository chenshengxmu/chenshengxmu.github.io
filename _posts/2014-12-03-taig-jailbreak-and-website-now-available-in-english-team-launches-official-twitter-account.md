* TaiG today launched an English version of its jailbreak tool and official website, making it easier for users to follow through the steps to download and use the utility to jailbreak their iOS devices running iOS 8 to iOS 8.1.1. In an effort to make communication with non-Chinese speakers better, the team has also launched a Twitter account, available in English as well.
* The English version of the site can be found at TaiG.com/en. The download link, jailbreak tool UI, tutorial, and changelog pages have all been translated in English. Although the translation of the website and the jailbreak tool aren’t perfect, this move will definitely make it less intimidating for users who haven’t used TaiG yet to take the plunge.

* TaiG also created a Twitter account. Available in English as well, @TaiG_Jailbreak appears to be the new communication channel of TaiG with English speakers. The account was created on November 29, but it became a little more active yesterday and today, with the announcement of the English version of the tool and website.
* Make sure to follow @TaiG_Jailbreak on Twitter for official news and announcement, and of course if you haven’t done so yet, make sure to follow @iDownloadBlog too as we provide more details and insight about all things jailbreak.
