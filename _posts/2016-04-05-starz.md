* Starz, a premium cable and satellite television network, today announced a brand new video service which permits owners of the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Apple TV to stream shows for a low monthly fee of just $8.99 per month.
* A companion iOS app lets subscribers download full episodes to watch offline but does not offer live streaming. On the fourth-generation Apple TV, it supports universal search so you can ask Siri for shows to watch, including original ones like “Outlander”, “Power” and the upcoming “American Gods”.
* Subscribers can access more than 2,400 television shows, original series and popular Hollywood movies including “Avengers: Age of Ultron”. Later this year, Starz will stream the latest “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” movie. The standalone service allows for up to four users watch simultaneously and virtually unlimited downloads.
* The Starz app is now available for the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch in the iOS App Store.
* To download it onto your fourth-generation Apple TV, search for ‘Starz’ in the tvOS App Store. You can sign up for the Starz service within the app, using the In-App Purchase mechanism.
* Starz is also available to Android fans in the Play store.
* Some of the biggest Starz Originals in 2016 include:

* Cable, satellite and premium pay TV subscribers can authenticate themselves within the Starz app to stream shows at no additional charge.
* Starz’s $8.99 monthly subscription fee compares favorably to Netflix, which starts at $7.99 per month. But more important than that, the new Starz service is cheaper than other services from big networks, like HNO NOW which costs $14.99 per month or Showtime that will set you back $10.99 per month.
* In celebration of the launch, the second installment premiere episode of “Outlander”, Starz’s hit series, will be made available beginning April 7 for streaming and download, two days before its official April 9 premiere at 9pm ET/PT.
