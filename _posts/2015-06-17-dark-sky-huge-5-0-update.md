* Popular weather client Dark Sky received a significant update today, bringing the app to version 5.0.0. The release includes several improvements like a new layout, advanced notifications, and the ability to collect pressure sensor data from compatible devices.
* As for the new layout, it now features a detailed hour-by-hour 24 hour timeline, and you can create custom alerts for that timeline for things like temperature, wind and more. There’s also a new weather reporter, so users can provide feedback on their weather.
* The pressure sensor support is perhaps the most intriguing new addition. iPhone 6 users can now opt in to have their phones automatically provide Dark Sky with pressure sensor data, which has the potential to dramatically improve short-term forecasts.
* Rounding out the update are significant speed improvements during launch, UV Index data, and landscape on the iPad. It’s really a huge update, and sounds like it’s going to make one of the most accurate weather applications available even more precise.
* You can find Dark Sky in the App Store, for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, for $3.99.
