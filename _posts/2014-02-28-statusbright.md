* StatusBright is a just-released jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. It’s a simple tweak that lets you change your iPhone’s brightness settings using a swipe on the status bar.
* You might remember a similar jailbreak tweak entitled SwipeBright. It, too, allowed you to swipe on the iPhone’s status bar in order to adjust the brightness settings of the device. Sadly, SwipeBright has yet to be updated to support iOS 7, so the developer of StatusBright felt that a new tweak was justified.
* Although adjusting the brightness on the iPhone is much easier with iOS 7’s Control Center, it’s still one less gesture that you need to perform by putting the controls directly on the status bar. Check inside for more details about how StatusBright works.

* For those of you who are familiar with the aforementioned SwipeBright tweak, you’ve probably spotted the fact that StatusBright features no preferences in the stock Settings app. SwipeBright, while simple in nature, featured quite a few toggles and preferences to customize the tweak’s operation. You won’t find any of that customization in StatusBright, in fact, there’s not even a preference panel for StatusBright available.
* Another thing about StatusBright that’s kind of a downer, is the fact that the swipes on the status bar only work on the SpringBoard and on the Lock screen. That means that you can’t adjust brightness settings via the status bar while an app is open. That, admittedly, kind of defeats some of the tweak’s handiness.
* What you do get, however, is a free jailbreak tweak that works right now on iOS 7. SwipeBright was $0.99 on Cydia, but StatusBright is completely free and available for download as we speak.
* If you’re looking for what is one of the more simple ways to quickly adjust your iPhone’s brightness levels, then look no further. Be sure to let us know what you think about StatusBright in the comments down below.
