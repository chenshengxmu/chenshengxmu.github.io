* Scanbot for iOS, the sleek and powerful document scanner and QR reader, has received an update Thursday.
* The new version expands on the list of third-party integrations with the addition of Wunderlist and Slack apps while introducing a brand new document naming feature across both iOS and Android editions.
* Available on a freemium basis, Scanbot 3.7 also includes optimized performance, functionality improvements, enhanced manual sharing and more.
* While Wunderlist as a new service to enhance your documents with reminders is only available to Scanbot Pro users, non-Pro users can freely use Wunderlist as a new cloud upload destination.
* Slack integration is freely available to everyone. We have been using Slack as our inter-office communications tools and couldn’t be happier with its capabilities.
* Slack integration in Scanbot allows you to directly upload your documents scans and associated comments into your team’s conversations and channels on Slack.
