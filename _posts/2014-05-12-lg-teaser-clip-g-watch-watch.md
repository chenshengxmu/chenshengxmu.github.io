* LG has posted a teaser clip this weekend for its upcoming G Watch, which is an Android Wear-based smartwatch. The video doesn’t offer up much in the way of specs or feature details, but it gives you a good look at its design and function.
* The G Watch will apparently be the first watch powered by Android’s new wearables platform it introduced back in March. It has a metal body, which is both dust and water resistant, and is compatible with a stout number of Android devices…
* Here’s the promotional teaser:
* And from the March press release:
* “The opportunity to work with Google on LG G Watch was the perfect chance for LG to really pull out all stops in both design and engineering,” said Dr. Jong-seok Park, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “With the LG G Watch, LG is continuing the milestones we’ve set in wearables following in the footsteps of the world’s first 3G Touch Watch Phone in 2009 and the Prada Link in 2008. We’re confident that a well-designed device has the potential to take the smart wearable market by storm.”
* LG certainly seems confident that the G Watch will be a hit, but I don’t see how this will be much better than Samsung’s Gear smartwatches. Sure, LG’s watch is running on Android Wear, but give it a few months and I bet a new Gear will too.
* But perhaps more significant than the G Watch itself is the fact that LG is making a smartwatch at all. It’s becoming very clear that wearables is the next big market in mobile electronics, and it seems like every major tech firm is working on one.

* Apple, for its part, is rumored to be working on a so-called ‘iWatch‘—a wearable accessory with various sensors capable of tracking health and fitness activities. We’ve heard a few potential release dates, but the consensus is it’ll be this year.
* There’s no word yet on when the G Watch will be available, but LG has a big event coming up in London on May 27.
