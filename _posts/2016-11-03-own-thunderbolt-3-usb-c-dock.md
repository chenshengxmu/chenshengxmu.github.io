* Other World Computing (OWC), a U.S.-based company and online store for Mac upgrades and accessories located at MacSales.com, today announced the ultimate docking station for your brand spanking new MacBook Pro.
* With the new Pro the Cupertino firm is (rightly) betting on USB-C, effectively putting us in a dongle hell for now. Enter the new $279 Thunderbolt 3 Dock, a successor to OWC’s Thunderbolt 2 Dock and USB-C Dock.
* Billed as the best expansion solution they’ve ever made, it offers the speed of Thunderbolt 3 technology coupled with a whopping thirteen expansion ports to help get the most out of the new late-2016 MacBook Pro.
* OWC’s dock lets you connect and charge up to six USB devices, hook up your notebook to Ethernet networks, transfer data and more—all at twice the speed of Thunderbolt 2 and all through a single cable.
* You get the following ports:
* I wish they built an adaptor in the box to give it an HDMI port, too!
* Because it uses Thunderbolt 3 that delivers 40Gb/s bandwidth, the dock supports custom display setups with a pair of 4K external displays or a combination of 4K, HD and other displays with the mini DisplayPort port and additional Thunderbolt 3 port.

* Creative pros with specialized and legacy ports like FireWire and optical audio will be delighted to learn that the dock offers a FireWire 800 port, analog stereo audio, S/PDIF digital audio and an SD card reader.
* “With our critically-acclaimed Thunderbolt 2 Dock and USB-C Dock, OWC defined a new standard in providing more connectivity at a time when new computers were shipping with fewer ports,” said Larry O’Connor, Founder and CEO, OWC.

* “The all-new Thunderbolt 3 Dock is the best expansion solution we’ve ever made, offering the incredible speed of Thunderbolt 3 technology coupled with 13 ports of connectivity, perfect for getting the most out of the new 2016 MacBook Pro.”
* The new Thunderbolt 3 Dock is covered by OWC’s two-year limited warranty and can be pre-ordered through the OWC website. Those who pre-order it will be treated to a free 0.5-meter Thunderbolt 3/USB-C cable.
* The accessory is expected to start shipping in February 2017.
