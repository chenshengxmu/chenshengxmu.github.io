* As several reports predicted, Apple is getting into the Healthcare industry with iOS 8 by introducing a new app called ‘Health.’ Health provides an easy-to-access hub where iPhone owners can store and monitor important fitness and health-related metrics.
* As explained by Craig Federighi, this is a huge improvement over the current situation, where this kind of information is spread across multiple apps and services. And of course, Apple also introduced HealthKit for developers, which means 3rd-party integration…

* Federighi detailed how Apple’s working with developers like Nike to build on the HealthKit platform, and it’s also working with the Mayo Clinic and other healthcare facilities to implement HealthKit’s technology into their own apps. May Clinic’s CEO says:
* “We believe Apple’s HealthKit will revolutionize how the health industry interacts with people. We are proud to be at the forefront of this innovative technology with the Mayo Clinic app.”
* It sounds like Apple’s new health initiative is much bigger than just a fill-in for Nike+ or FitBit client, and it’ll be interesting to see where it goes from here.
