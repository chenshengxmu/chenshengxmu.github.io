* The struggling Internet giant – once synonymous for anything remotely dealing with online content – on Monday issued a brand new app called Yahoo Screen.
* The company is billing the app as a remote control for web video of sorts. More appropriately, Yahoo Screen is your one-stop shop for both Yahoo’s original and licensed video content.
* You can instantly stream news, sports, food, and entertainment videos from MLB, UFC, The Onion, Martha Stewart and lots more, free of charge (no strings attached). But that’s just scratching the surface as Yahoo’s licensed video library includes such TV shows as Saturday Night Live, along with Yahoo Originals featuring Jack Black, Ed Helms, Zachary Levi, Cheryl Hines, Rachael Harris and more…
* Writing in a blog post, Yahoo’s Director of Product Management, Robby Stein, praised the remote control functionality which lets you use side-to-side swipes to efficiently browse through videos.
* The up/down swiping is used to change the channel. And when you’re watching a show episode, just swipe left or right to skip between episodes.
* To get you going, we’re proud to announce a brand new deal with Viacom to bring you clips from some of Comedy Central’s best shows, including The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report.
* Together with the exclusive digital clip archive of Saturday Night Live, Yahoo Screen now offers you access to some of the most storied franchises in comedy history, on any device.
* Yahoo also has the Fall 2013 Comedy Lineup live.

* The iPad interface certainly looks business. The app includes the popular Trending Clips section and features basic TV show-searching capabilities.

* You can download Yahoo Screen free from the App Store.
