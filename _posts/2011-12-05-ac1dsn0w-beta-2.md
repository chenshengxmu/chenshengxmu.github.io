* The Pwn Dev Team has released a major update to their jailbreak tool, Ac1dSn0w. The tool was made available to the world a couple of weeks ago as an alternative to other apps for jailbreaking, like RedSn0w and PwnageTool.
* Ac1dSn0w Beta 2 supposedly fixes the copyright infringement issues that the original beta possessed. The download file size has also been significantly reduced from over 100MB to about 11MB.
* From the Pwn Dev Team blog:
* CHANGELOG:
* Beta 2:
* Supported Devices (iOS5/iOS5.0.1):
* Ac1dSn0w still offers a tethered jailbreak. Because we have been led to believe by other jailbreak developers that this release of Ac1dSn0w is indeed legal, we have added the Beta 2 download link to our Downloads page. You can also see our dedicated Ac1dSn0w tutorial for Beta 1 to learn how to jailbreak with the tool — the steps have remained exactly the same. Ac1dSn0w is only available on the Mac.
* You may be asking why you should use Ac1dSn0w, and, honestly, we can’t give you a good reason at the moment. Currently, the tool offers nothing more than (actually, it technically offers less features) other prominent jailbreak tools like, RedSn0w.
* The developers of Ac1dSn0w have promised that big things are coming for Ac1dSn0w users, like the ability to remotely jailbreak an iDevice, but the current Beta 2 offers nothing to make you jump ship from what you’re already using to jailbreak.
