* To some, having periodicals in one place and books in another place can seem redundant. If you’re in this camp, then Bookstand may be something that makes sense.
* Bookstand is a jailbreak tweak that places iBooks content into Newsstand, letting you access all of your reading content in one convenient place.
* All that this tweak does is place a shortcut to your iBooks content directly into Newsstand. It isn’t adding a hard link to your iBooks content or moving anything, it’s just a shortcut to the content you can otherwise still access in iBooks. This is great if you’re sick and tired of switching back and forth between iBooks and Newsstand.
* Bookstand should be out sometime within the next few days on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It will be available to jailbreakers for $0.99.
* Do you think this is something that would come in handy, or are you content with switching between iBooks and Newsstand to access all of your reading content?
