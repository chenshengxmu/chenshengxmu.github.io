* Mother’s Day is right around the corner and you may have forgotten to get a gift for the most important person in your life. Have no fear. You can send her a digital card, or make her a virtual bouquet of flowers. If you are really creative, you can find a way to turn a few iOS apps into the best Mother’s Day she’s ever had.
* Whether the mom in your life needs pampering or just wants to be left alone on her special day, we’ve got a list of apps we think will help make this Mother’s Day great. Mom, if you are reading this, I love you…

* If you haven’t mailed out your Mother’s Day card yet, you are quickly running out of time. You may want to think about going digital. This is one of my favorite apps for sending cute cards to mom. If you have young ones in your life, get them to help create customized cards using pictures from your camera roll or just backgrounds from the app. There are dozens of clipart pictures that you can drag and drop onto the card to resize, rotate, and manipulate to fit. If you don’t want to make a card from construction paper and glue, this app is the next best thing. There is a lite version if you just want to try it out. This app is available for $0.99.

* Mother’s Day is the busiest time of the year for flower vendors. If you want something delivered to the mom in your life on Sunday, you’d better put your order in now. The easiest way to get your flowers delivered is through 1-800-Flowers and this app puts you directly in touch with the service. The app features best selling bouquets, a special occasion category, exclusive offers for iOS app users, and immediate purchase and checkout from within the app. Once you’ve placed your flower order, you can track it to its delivery using the order status feature. This app is available for free.

* If the mom in your life is not a fan of the current run of movies to hit the box office this weekend, why not settle in for some radio shows instead. Plug your iPhone into an external speaker, sit down with a cup of coffee, and listen to comedy shows from the likes of Abbott and Costello, adventure stories staring Little Orphan Annie, and radio dramas from Radio City Playhouse. There are more than 1,800 episodes to choose from. You can make your own popcorn, get a liter of soda and feel like you are living in the 1940s with this great old-time radio app. This app is available free.

* This may be a stereotype, but speaking from multiple decades of experience, I think I can say that women love a good cupcake. You may not think you can handle the mess that comes from a few hours of baking. However, not only will your attempt at cupcake making melt her heart, but you will also reap the rewards of freshly baked goods. The recipes in this app range from super simple chocolate chip cupcakes, to complex decorated Easter Basket cupcakes. There is even a Mother’s Day recipe that takes a “bit of effort” in the skills department. This app is available for free.

* If you don’t have enough confidence in your baking skills, you can always take the lady out to dinner instead. Like the flower industry, Mother’s Day is one of the restaurant industry’s busiest times of the year. To be sure that you have a table waiting for you, book your reservation through Open Table. This easy-to-use app lets you book a table at more than 20,000 different locations. You can browse restaurants near you, see what tables are available at the time of booking, filter your restaurant search by type, price range, or area, and see menus, ratings, and reviews. Once you’ve picked a place to eat, making a reservation is only a few taps away. This app is available for free.

* The best way to show your mom that you really love her is to get her name tattooed on your back. Amiright? Well, the sentiment is nice, but your mom might think otherwise. Show her that you mean so much to her that you would permanently display her name on your chest without having to actually go through with it. This entertainment app lets you apply the ink without it sticking to your skin. Use the included clipart to turn your untouched skin into an artist’s canvas. With an additional $0.99 in-app purchase, you can have your mom’s name on your arm, you wife’s name on your back, and your sweet little daughter’s name on your forehead. Don’t worry. You won’t regret these tattoos in 20 years. This app is available for free.
