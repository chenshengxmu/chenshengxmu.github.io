* HBO fans will be happy to hear that the premium TV network is reportedly working with Apple on a content deal that would bring a large chunk of its programming to the Apple TV.
* As most of you know, HBO already has an iOS app for viewing content, called HBO GO. But it doesn’t support AirPlay, meaning it can’t be watched on a TV via the set-top box…
* That could all change in the near future though, as Bloomberg (via 9to5Mac) is reporting this afternoon that the two companies are close to reaching an Apple TV content deal:
* “Apple Inc. (AAPL) is in negotiations to start carrying Time Warner Inc. (TWX)’s HBO Go application on Apple TV by mid-2013, according to two people familiar with the plans.
* Cable and satellite subscribers who pay for HBO will be able to watch more than 600 hours of films and television shows on Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Apple TV is a set-top device that streams content purchased on iTunes and via other online services to consumers’ televisions.”
* Apple has been working hard over the past year to expand the selection of streaming services on its Apple TV platform. HBO would join Netflix, and the recently-added Hulu Plus.
* The device, which is rumored to be getting a refresh in the next few months, has been doing very well as of late. During the holiday quarter, Apple sold a record-high 2 million Apple TVs.
* Tim Cook recently said that the TV space “continues to be an intense area of interest for Apple.” But beyond that, there’s still no indication that it has plans to move on to anything bigger.
