* You’re probably accustomed to hearing the typical keyboard clicks as you type on your iPhone, but a new jailbreak tweak called MusicalKeyboard aims to make things a little more interesting by playing the sounds of musical instruments instead.
* After you install this tweak, you can choose which instrument noise your keyboard makes while you’re typing. To do this, you’ll need to pay a visit to the tweak’s preferences pane in the Settings app:

* From here, you can turn the tweak on or off and choose a musical instrument you want to hear the sound effects of as you type. Your choices in musical instruments are:
* Every time you change the instrument type, you will need to tap on the Save Changes and Respring button for your changes to be appended.
* Although at first thought you might assume hearing a musical instrument with every key tap would get annoying after a while, it actually sounds surprisingly nice as you type.
* One thing you should know before you download this tweak is each key tap plays a random note, so you can’t actually play the instrument you choose by tapping on specific keys. This may be a downer for some, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles.
* If for any reason you can’t hear any noises after downloading this tweak, then you’ll need to make sure you have keyboard sounds enabled from Settings > Sounds > Keyboard Clicks.
* MusicalKeyboard is available to download on any jailbroken iOS 8 or iOS 9 device from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $0.99.
* Do you like the regular keyboard clicks or the instrumental sounds better? Let us know in the comments below.
