* Apple has added 10 new companies to the list of data providers for its Maps app, according to Apple Maps Marketing. In a post, first spotted by 9to5Mac, the site says it was given the information by the Cupertino company itself in response to an inquiry.
* The inquiry was in regards to submitting one of its clients with a few hundred locations to Apple Maps Connect. Apple replied, saying it’s currently only accepting submissions from businesses with 1,000+ locations, but it could reach out to several firms.
* It then provided this list:
* As AMM points out, we were already aware that Yelp, Factual and Neustar/Localeze were providing data for Apple Maps, but the others are new. This suggests Apple has signed the 10 other providers more recently—all of which specialize in business listings.
* When Apple Maps debuted in the fall of 2012, it received a lot of criticism for missing and inaccurate data, and other missteps. It has spent the last 3 years improving the software, and there have been indications recently it’s ready to take it to the next level.
