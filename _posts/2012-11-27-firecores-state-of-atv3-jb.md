* Since Apple unveiled the third-generation Apple TV earlier this year, folks have been clamoring for it to be jailbroken. It has a faster processor, double the RAM and streams video in a higher quality — who wouldn’t want to take advantage of it?
* And there’s no one itching for an Apple TV 3 jailbreak more than the folks over at FireCore, the makers of the popular aTV Flash software suite. Well today, the team spoke out about the progress (or lack there of) that is being made on the hack…
* From FireCore’s blog post:
* “As you may recall we were very optimistic about the ATV3 when it originally launched back in March, and while this optimism remains unchanged it’s clear things have not progressed as quickly as anyone would have liked. The biggest hurdle that has yet to be overcome is also the most essential – the jailbreak. While we tend to think of ourselves as pretty resourceful, the security related expertise that is required in order to release a jailbreak for iOS based devices like the ATV is just not in our wheelhouse, and we’re simply left to encourage the capable few as best we can.”
* Unfortunately, as with the iPhone 5 and other newer devices, it doesn’t sound like much has changed on the ATV jailbreak front. FireCore says that efforts are ongoing to find a solution for both the ATV2 (5.1 untethered) and the ATV3, but so far no luck.
* The lack of an Apple TV 3 jailbreak continues to drive up the price of its predecessor. On Amazon, right now, the second generation ATV is listed at a staggering $259.99, while the third gen model has been discounted down to $89 for the holidays.
* For those of you who are lucky enough to own a second-gen Apple TV, on older firmware, we do have tutorials on how to jailbreak it. And if you’re interested in FireCore’s aTV Flash software, you can find it on their website (they just released a huge update).
