* Lab analysis conducted by DisplayMate rated iPhone X’s Super Retina display the most innovative and top performing smartphone panel they’ve ever tested, but now Samsung’s newly unveiled Galaxy S9 has beaten Apple’s device in terms of screen quality.
* Although iPhone X’s excellent custom-made OLED panel is manufactured by Samsung Display, the South Korean conglomerate has managed to push image quality on the new Galaxy S9 series even further. As a result, DisplayMate awarded Galaxy S9 with the title of the best performing smartphone display currently available on the market. It’s also the first smartphone display to receive All Green ratings in all of DisplayMate’s lab tests.
* According to DisplayMate President Dr. Raymond Soneira, Samsung’s new baby rocks an impressive display that has established many new performance records and become DisplayMate’s Best Performing Smartphone Display receiving their highest ever A+ grade.
* The latest Galaxy has matched or outperformed iPhone X in terms of the highest absolute color accuracy, highest peak display brightness, largest native color gamut, highest contrast ratio and lowest screen reflectance (4.4%), with the color accuracy of Samsung’s Super AMOLED panel being described as “visually indistinguishable from perfect”.
* The Samsung phone features a 5.8-inch 3K resolution panel at 2,960-by-1,440 pixels (570 pixels per inch). By comparison, iPhone X’s 5.8-inch screen is a 2,436-by-1,125-pixel resolution OLED panel (458 pixels per inch). Despite all the improvements, the Samsung panel still sports the same power efficiency as the previous version found on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 devices.
