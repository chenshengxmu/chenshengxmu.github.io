* You can now check out the most interesting articles and videos you might have missed using Pocket’s newly launched Recommendations feature. Available in Pocket’s latest 6.0 update in the App Store, Recommendations takes “the absolute best content being saved across Pocket” and tailors it to your own saving and reading habit, based on what you save, read and watch in Pocket.
* The new Recommendations feed is available in Pocket 6.0 for the iPhone, iPo touch and iPad. Conceived as a high-quality content feed without the noise, the feature takes advantage of the more than two billion items saved to Pockets thus far and millions more being added every day.
* “The channels we use to discover the stories we’re interested in — Twitter, Facebook, and a slew of news readers, etc. – are dictated by page views and favor real-time, meaning great content has a relatively short lifespan,” notes Pocket.
* “As a result, what’s good is constantly pushed down by what’s simply new.”

* Your personalized Recommendations can be found alongside your List and new stories. Pocket says new Recommendations are added throughout each day.
* If you see something you like in the Recommendations feed, you can save it directly to your List by tapping the Pocket button. Likewise, you can remove an unwanted Recommendation by tapping the X symbol on any item.
* The more you save and interact with Pocket, the better your Recommendations get.
* “Training for a half-marathon? The more you save about running, the more likely it is you’ll start seeing high-quality running content to help you get ready for your race,” explains Pocket.
* Recommendations are currently available in English-only.
* While the team is working to expand Recommendations to other languages, our non-US fans should be able to access them by changing their regional preferences in the iOS Settings app to English (United States).
* Pocket requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOs 7.0 or later.
* The 32.5-megabyte app is optimized for native display resolution of the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and currently lacks an Apple Watch app. A subscription to Pocket Premium is available as a $4.99 per month In-App Purchase.
* The app is localized in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish and Traditional Chinese.
* Grab Pocket free in the App Store.
