* As we noted earlier, the TaiG 2.1.2 untethered jailbreak tool was just released to much fanfare. This is the version of the tool that works as you would expect. It’s compatible with the latest version of iTunes, and works with Cydia Substrate out of the box.
* Sadly TaiG 2.1.2 is still Windows only, but we have a good virtual machine tutorial for Mac only users. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to jailbreak iOS 8.3 with TaiG 2.1.2 in mere minutes.
* Note: this tool requires Windows or a virtual machine running windows. You must have iTunes installed for this to work. The version I used in the video is the Chinese version due to the wait time for the English version download, but the two version are completely identical and just as easy to use.
* Be sure to have Find My iPhone and passcode lock disabled before proceeding with this jailbreak.
* Step 1: Download TaiG 2.1.2 from our downloads page; save and extract it to your desktop
* Step 2: Connect your iOS 8.3 device to your computer
* Step 3: Launch TaiG 2.1.2
* Step 4: Uncheck the 3K assistant checkbox
* Step 5: Click Start to begin the jailbreak
* Once the jailbreak completes, launch Cydia to start the Cydia initialization process. Congratulations, you are now jailbroken on iOS 8.3 with a working Cydia Substrate!
* Now it’s time to download and enjoy all of the compatible tweaks available for iOS 8.3.
* Are you happy to now have a jailbreak that just works?
