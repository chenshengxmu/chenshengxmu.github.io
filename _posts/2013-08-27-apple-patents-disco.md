* Combine the huge iTunes library of songs with the social aspect of sharing and you have a bit of an idea what might be behind a patent granted to Apple Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
* The patent, which describes a ‘Coordinated group musical experience,’ takes a riff off a trendy activity known as ‘silent discos,’ where people gather to listen to a DJ’s music wearing headphones, rather than blaring mega-decibel volumes. Does the patent address a glaring technology need? No, but it does remind us of Apple’s own quirky roots…
* According to Apple’s patent abstract (via AppleInsider), the invention involves the “sharing of a music experience amongst a group of people each using a personal communication device,” including the iPhone, iPad or iPod.
* Rather than simply sharing song amongst a number of people, the technology transmits a song’s traits, like tempo and number of beats per minute. The system then searches your music database, picks the closest match and we’re off to the disco.
* Apple has patented other forms of device sharing, including sharing the flash feature to produce the best lighting for a photograph. Although some quality iOS apps for DJs have been released on the App Store, today’s patent may indicate Apple is considering creating one for its base of iTunes users.
* In the patent, the company mentions that the technology for a ‘silent disco’ can fit in a single app. Whether this means a standalone app is possible, or Apple is thinking of including the technology in iTunes – or something not envisioned, is up for conjecture.
