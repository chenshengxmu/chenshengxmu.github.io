* Yesterday afternoon, OtterBox showed off a brand new series of iPhone cases it’s calling ‘Symmetry.’ The new cases are surprisingly minimal, compared to the accessory-maker’s other offerings, and consists of just one solid piece.
* OtterBox says that the new case is the culmination of over a year of design, testing and innovation. It’s one of the slimmest, most protective cases in its class, and will be available in a number of different colors and graphic designs…

* From the company’s press release:
* “The OtterBox Symmetry Series is the culmination of over a year of design, testing and innovation. This slender, cleanly constructed protective smartphone case is molded into a single piece for ease of installation. A dual-material construction makes Symmetry Series one of the slimmest, most protective cases in its class and a raised beveled edge helps keep the touch screen safe. Internal synthetic rubber with honeycomb coring helps protect the device from drops and shock. A full spectrum of wraparound colors and graphics on the sleek exterior add seamless style that slides easily into and out of pockets.”
* And of course the official promo spot:
* Honestly, I don’t see anything necessarily groundbreaking here. But with OtterBox’s track record in the iPhone case space, anytime it introduces something new, people pay attention. I will admit, though, the white/gray one looks sharp.
* The OtterBox Symmetry cases will be compatible with the iPhone 5, 5s and 5c, and again will be available in a plethora of different color and graphic combinations. They’ll start shipping this spring with a price tag between $40 and $45.
* What do you think of the Symmetry?
