* Want to know what apps Apple featured in its latest iPhone 5s ad titled ‘Powerful’, which started airing last evening? The 30-second commercial suggests that “with the power of iPhone 5s, you’re more powerful than you think” by highlighting a number of content creation use cases involving a bunch of third-party apps found on the App Store.
* If you’ve seen the ad, chances are you’ve spotted a scene in which some guy uses the iPhone’s flash as a heart rate monitor, but what about all the other apps?
* That’s what a new section on Apple’s website is for. Titled ‘Powerful’, the new microsite is solely created with the purpose of exploring the apps from the commercial…
* “You have the power to create, shape and share your life,” reads a message on the microsite. “It’s right there in your hand. Or bag. Or pocket. It’s your iPhone 5s.”
* Here’s the list of apps featured in the spot:
* • AmpliTube, $13.99 • Cleartune, $3.99 • Instant Heart Rate, $1.99 • Luminair, $129.99 • Pacific Rim, $0.99 • Star Walk, $0.99 • Word Lens, Free
* For those wondering about the add’s song, it’s “Gigantic” by the Pixies, available on iTunes.
* App developers whose work gets featured in Apple’s commercial typically see their numbers shoot up as a result of exposure.
* I bet Instant Heart Rate developer Azumio will benefit the most due to the eye-catching nature of the program. I’ve immediately picked it up after watching the ad because – you know – who needs a dedicated heart rate sensor when there’s an app for that (I’m looking at you, Galaxy S5!).
