* Siri giving witty responses ahead of major Apple events has become something of a tradition for Apple and part of the festivities by its eager fans. The just-announced September 7 iPhone 7 press conference is no exception. Thanks to a silent backend update, Siri now serves up a variety of amusing responses when asked about the iPhone 7 event.
* Best thing you check them out for yourself.
* The right way of getting those funny remarks is to invoke Siri, then say “See you on the seventh”. You can see some of the typical responses I got top of post. Additional choice remarks from Siri regarding the September 7 event are included right below.

* “See you on the seventh,” of course, is the tagline on Apple’s invite.
* Those of you who have received witty responses other than those I screenshoted for this article, please post them down in the comments for everyone to see.
