* Don’t you wish your iPhone had wireless charging like the Apple Watch does? I didn’t think wireless charging would be a thing for me until my Apple Watch and its inductive charger landed on my desk. I now want this technology on my iPhone but until Apple delivers a wireless charging solution of its own, we’ll have to make do with third-party accessories.
* Today, I want to talk about the ON Charger battery and the ON Case for your iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus which recently launched on crowd-funding platform Kickstarter. Both the charging base and the case feature a cool magnet assisted design making them cross-compatible with multiple smartphone brands.
* In addition to syncing and charging your smartphone via USB and providing high level of protection, the case integrates a simple magnetic interface, allowing it to charge your iPhone wirelessly.
* You just place your device on top of the charging base. The case and the charger simply snap together and start charging your device wirelessly. The snapping has been realized through magnetic charge rings in both the case and the charger.

* Moreover, the ON Charger has an integrated 5,000mAh battery so you can charge your smartphone on the go up to three times without connecting to a wall outlet.
* The charger was designed for any device which supports Qi, an industry-standard wireless charging platform, meaning you can use it to wirelessly charge Samsung’s latest Galaxy S6 smartphone and other Qi-compatible devices.
* The Qi wireless transmitter is found on both top and bottom of the charger, one for charging your smartphone and the other to wirelessly recharge the charger. The solution also supports simultaneous recharging of both the charging base and your iPhone.

* It’s interesting that multiple ON chargers can be stacked on top of each other, allowing you to recharge them together from a single outlet.
* The ON Case and ON Charger are available in both matte black and matte white color options through Kickstarter, with eighteen days to go until hitting the $80,000 funding goal.
* Here’s the promotional video.
* The minimal pledge for the ON Case is $39, and an additional $69 for the ON Charger. A combined case and charger combo is $85. At post time, backers have pledged nearly $24,000 out of the $80,000 goal.

* “We’ve completed multiple rounds of prototypes refining the design and testing different magnet strengths,” Will Matters, Founder and Lead Product Designer wrote.
* They now have several fully functioning units that have been put through testing with a small group of users. It’s also nice that they’re working with Apple on MFi (Made for iPhone) certification for the accessory.
* Their target delivery date is before the end of August, 2015.
