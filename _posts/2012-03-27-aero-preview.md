* SBCoders — the same developer behind the highly anticipated Deck jailbreak tweak – is back at it again. Aero is the latest creation from SBCoders, and their aim is to bring significant style and grace to the mundane task of switching apps.
* Do they succeed in accomplishing their goal? Check out our in-depth video preview of Aero for the answer…
* The beta preview of Aero that we tested was three short of a dozen different animations. These ranged from your typical CoverFlow, to an extremely classy wheel animation that reminds us of your father’s rolodex.
* Aero doesn’t necessarily do anything groundbreaking at this point, but it certainly accomplishes the task of spicing up an otherwise ordinary activity.
* Expect SBCoders to take their time with this release to make sure it’s just right before making it publicly available. That’s a rarity these days, so we should appreciate their hard work to bring us well working tweaks.
* Let us know what you think about Aero. Does it seem like the type of tweak you’d like to use?
