* Apple’s rumored less-pricey iPhone has been widely reported by analysts, supply chain sources, pundits and big media as arriving later this year in a range of colors and encased in a super-thin plastic casing mixed with glass fiber. Taking it all in, concept artists Nickolay Lamm and Matteo Gianni have created created an interesting renderings depicting the four-inch device with a curved backside and a translucent plastic shell resembling Apple’s G3 iMac…
* Apple, of course, in the past used translucent plastic to make the iMac G3 seem less alien to consumers.
* “The ability to see inside the computer made the device seem less mysterious and much more personal,” the designer duo explains.

* They write:
* We’ve gotten so used to our smartphones that we aren’t the least bit impressed with the technology that makes them work.
* The translucent material can do the same thing for the budget iPhone what it did for the iMac G3: open up our eyes as to the incredible advances in computing that have been made and make people excited about buying a phone again.
* Here are a few more renderings, via Business Insider.

* Though these mockups matche up nicely to the rumor-mill reports, I personally like Martin Hajek’s polycarbonate budget iPhone renderings better – it just looks less cheap to me.
