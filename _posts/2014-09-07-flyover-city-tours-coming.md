* In the run-up to the forthcoming iOS 8 launch, Apple appears to have recently added dozens of cities and landmarks to the automated three-dimensional Flyover tours available in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, according to evidence MacRumors discovered Sunday. Specifically, as many as 40 locations are Flyover city tour-enabled out of the 90 cities where regular Flyovers are available.
* Apple has also been expanding Flyover coverage with the latest additions of the Yosemite National Park in the United States and Wellington in New Zealand.
* As MacRumors has discovered, the following Flyover locations currently have Flyover city tours enabled:
* The Apple Maps app in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite distinguishes between regular Flyover locations and those with city tours enabled with a small “3D” icon instead of the standard dot used to mark location.
* Tapping the icon launches a scripted aerial tour of the city rendered in Apple Maps’ three-dimensional Flyover mode (more on that here).
* To see Flyover city tours in action, check out this video.
* In the past twelve months the Cupertino firm has introduced regular Flyover views for a bunch of landmarks and locations. According to the iOS 7 Feature Availability webpage, regular Flyovers are currently available in 90 places around the world.
