* This week has been busy for those of us at iDB since iOS 10 was released to the public for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Of course, the jailbreak community doesn’t sleep just because Apple releases a new firmware update.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks that were released in Cydia this week, starting with our favorites.

* AppRestrict is a useful new jailbreak tweak that lets you impose time limits on specific apps to keep yourself more productive throughout the day.
* It’s perfect for locking yourself out of those distracting social media apps that always end up sucking down all your time when you have more important things to do.
* With configurable time limits that you can impose on a per-app basis, there is a lot of flexibility to play with.
* You can read our full review to get a better understanding of how this tweak works and whether or not it should be installed on your device.

* FlashAlert is a cool new tweak that lets you assign fully-customized LED flash alerts to any apps you want to on your iPhone.
* With all of the options you have, you can easily set a different kind of LED flash alert for each app you use regularly and tell which app is notifying you with just the LED flash alone. It isn’t mandatory to assign every app an LED flash alert, so you can simply set one up for your favorite apps.
* Complete with options for flash intensity, different kinds of patterns, and also repeating settings, this tweak has a lot of options you can tinker with to get the LED flash notification experience you want, something Apple’s stock LED flash alerts fail to do.
* To learn more about how this tweak works, head over to our full review.

* MusicalKeyboard is a fun new tweak designed for music-lovers who also enjoy texting.
* With it, you can replace your typical iOS keyboard click sound with the sounds of your favorite musical instruments. Each key tap plays a randomized note from the instrument you choose.
* Although some people make their jailbroken devices stand out with themes and visual effects, this is a great way to show off the audible benefits of having a device you can do anything with.
* To learn more about how the tweak works, check our our full review.

* At the moment, there’s no jailbreak for iOS 10, but it’s believed that Pangu is working hard on one. Cross your fingers!
