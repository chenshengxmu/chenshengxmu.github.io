* Apple on Wednesday announced the new Apple Watch Series 2, the second generation of its popular smartwatch. In addition to waterproofing, built-in GPS and other new features, the Series 2 is also going to be available in a brand new material: ceramic.
* As you can see in the image above, the ceramic model comes in a pearl-white type of color. It’s very classy-looking, and provides a nice alternative to the aluminum and stainless steel options. Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $369, pre-orders open September 9.
* Update: Apple has posted better images and more information about the ceramic Apple Watch Series 2 on its website:

* Now in stunning ceramic.
* Apple Watch Edition has been reimagined in brilliant white ceramic, engineered to be as strong as it is beautiful. With all the great features of Apple Watch Series 2, it’s the next generation of a timepiece that knows no equal.
* Sleek, light, and extremely durable, ceramic is more than four times as hard as stainless steel — with a pearly, lustrous finish that won’t scratch or tarnish.
* The process of creating the Apple Watch Edition case begins with a high-strength zirconia powder that’s combined with alumina to achieve its rich, white color. Each case is then compression molded, sintered, and polished using a diamond slurry, which results in a remarkably smooth surface and an exquisite shine. With this precise level of workmanship, every Apple Watch Edition case takes days to make.

* It’s also worth noting that like the previous Edition model, this one includes a charging dock:
