* Job listings discovered in May 2016 suggested that Apple’s first retail store in the New York City borough of Brooklyn could open for business this year. Today, the company’s Retail website officially announced that grand opening of its all-new Brooklyn store will take place on Sunday, July 30, at 10am local time.
* “We’ve got something special in store for you,” reads a notice on the Apple Retail website, which invites customers to join the company for the store’s grand opening.
* The outlet is located at 247 Bedford Avenue, at the corner of North 3rd Street, in the Williamsburg neighborhood. Store hours are 10am-8pm on Monday-Saturday and 11am-7pm on Sunday.
* Apple apparently negotiated a long-term $66 million lease for the Williamsburg store. According to The New York Post in December 2014, the two-story building for the store “is getting a whole new look, featuring dramatic, arched windows.”
* That sounds like Jony Ive to me.
* Remember, Ive and his team personally came up with the company’s new retail design evidenced by the beautiful Union Square store in downtown San Francisco.
* The Cupertino company is also thought to be interested in creating a store inside the Westfield shopping complex at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.
