* In addition to polling your Instagram followers by using the poll sticker in a Story, you can also privately send an interactive question to everyone in a big group conversation through Direct.
* Before, the poll sticker only worked with Stories, allowing your followers to vote by tapping an option you’ve provided or sliding the emoji you’ve chosen, and see realtime results.

* The poll sticker can also be used in Direct, Instagram’s direct-messaging feature. As mentioned, you can have everyone in a big group thread polled or limit your interactive question to a one-on-one conversation. Before taking advantage of private polling in Direct, be sure to update your Instagram app to the most recent version in App Store.
* Do the following to poll people privately on Instagram.
* 1) Open Instagram on your iPhone.
* 2) Open your Direct inbox by tapping the paper airplane icon in the top-right corner.

* Your recipient(s) will see the photo or video along with the included interactive poll sticker.

* Polls in Direct is a very cool feature, regardless of whether you’re asking for a friend’s opinion or polling a bunch of people at once. By permitting the use of the poll sticker in Direct, Instagram makes it easy to privately solicit feedback about anything you’re passionate about from a bunch of friends, without anyone else seeing your question or their responses.
* The photo-sharing service in July 2018 introduced a new questions stickers that could double as a great conversation starter. By adding that interactive sticker to your Story, you’re publicly asking your followers to submit questions for you to answer.

* As an example, you could take advantage of this feature to have your friends vote on the various proposals for that school project you’ve been working, or maybe you could use it for things like vacation planning with a group of friends in private messages.
