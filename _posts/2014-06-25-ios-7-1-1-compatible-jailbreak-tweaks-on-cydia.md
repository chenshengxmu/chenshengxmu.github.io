* It has been a few days since the Chinese team Pangu surprised us with an iOS 7.1.1 untethered jailbreak, and the dust is finally starting to settle. After learning that the jailbreak is safe to use, we’ve gone ahead and shared video guides on how to jailbreak iOS 7.1.1 on Windows and how to jailbreak iOS 7.1.1 on OS X. We also answered some of the other pressing questions surrounding the jailbreak, including the two exploits used for this method.
* We’ve been receiving a lot of questions on our social platforms and comments about which jailbreak tweaks are compatible with iOS 7.1.1, so we’ve gone ahead and compiled a list based off this shared document by JailbreakQA moderator iAdam1n. While our jailbreak guru Jeff Benjamin has tested some of these tweaks, we cannot guarantee that all of the packages listed will work with your specific iOS device, version or other tweaks installed… 
* Once again, a huge credit goes to JailbreakQA moderator iAdam1n and the rest of the jailbreaking community that has contributed to this collaborative list. Make sure that you are running the latest version of these tweaks to ensure support for iOS 7.1 – 7.1.1, and keep in mind that personal results may vary. As more developers get around to updating their tweaks, feel free to share in the comments section below.
