* Apple announced its financial results for Q2 2014 this afternoon, and for the most part it beat the Street’s expectations. The company sold 43.7 million iPhones and pulled in $45.6 billion in revenue during the three month period, although it did miss slightly on iPad sales at just 16.3 million.
* We’re just finishing up the conference call, where Tim Cook, CFO Peter Oppenheimer and other members of the executive team have discussed Apple’s performance, touted some user stats, and offered insight into the future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points for you…
* Overall, Apple seems pretty happy with the quarter, as is Wall Street—in rare form, AAPL is actually up around 8% in after hours trading. The other big takeaway from the call is that it sounds like Apple is very anxious to show off some of the things it’s been working on over the past several months.
