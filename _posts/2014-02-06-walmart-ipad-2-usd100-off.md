* The unreasonably priced iPad 2 with sixteen gigabytes of storage and no cellular sells for $399. You’d be hard-pressed to justify buying a 2011 tablet at that price when $399 can buy you the latest iPad mini with Retina display instead. On the other hand, some customers such as schools and businesses clearly see the value or Apple otherwise wouldn’t be keeping the device on the market at that price.
* If for any reason you’re in the market for a second-generation iPad, Walmart has a sweet deal for you in the form of an electronic $100 Walmart gift card…
* CNET is reporting that Walmart has shaved $100 off the $399 iPad 2. The sale starts today and is good for the next 30 days.
* You’ll need to trade-in your original iPad (or any iPad model for that matter) for a $100 Walmart electronic gift card that can be redeemed against your iPad 2 purchase or any other item, at walmart.com or in the stores.
* Walmart’s $100 price cut on the iPad2 doesn’t appear to be getting matched by Apple Stores. http://t.co/z6bT1canx4 $AAPL

* Even at $299, it’s still pricey and can’t be recommended. You could also get yourself an iPad mini for that money. Besides, used iPad 2 units can be found on Craiglist for as low as $150.
* They’re also giving at least $100 (as much as $300) for any working smartphone when upgrading to any of the following phones via a two-year agreement with AT&T or Verizon.
