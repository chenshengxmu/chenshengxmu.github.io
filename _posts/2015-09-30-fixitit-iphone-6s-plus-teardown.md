* After taking apart the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s, repair wizards over at iFixit have now disassembled its bigger brethren, the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus (model A1687/A1634) After popping the handset open, the iFixit team immediately discovered a largely unchanged layout from the iPhone 6 and a slightly smaller battery versus last year’s iPhone 6 Plus.
* In line with the rumors, the battery inside the iPhone 6s Plus is of a 2,750 mAh variety, representing a modest 165 mAh downgrade versus the iPhone 6 Plus battery rated at 3.82 V and 11.1 Wh of energy, for a total of 2915 mAh.
* Despite the downgrade, Apple claims battery life will be comparable to that of the iPhone 6 Plus: 14 hours of 3G talk time, approximately 10 hours of internet use and up to ten days on standby.

* The iPhone 6s Plus weighs in at 192 grams (6.77 ounces), a twenty-gram difference versus last year’s iPhone 6 Plus at 172 grams (6.07 ounces) and a 63-gram difference compared to its smaller brother, the iPhone 6s which weighs 129 grams (4.55 ounces).
* As is the case with the iPhone 6s, the increase in iPhone 6s Plus weight is mostly due to a substantially heavier display assembly which now uses an additional layer with 96 sensors that measure force exerted on the screen.

* The display assembly itself on the iPhone 6s Plus weighs in at about 80 grams versus 60 grams on last year’s iPhone 6 Plus model. “This astonishing 33 percent increase in weight is all because of Apple’s new 3D Touch technology,” iFixit notes.
* iFixit noted in a separate post that both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are dramatically less prone to liquid damage than their predecessors.
* Apple’s achieved higher tolerances to water damage through the use of a 0.3 mm wider lip running along the perimeter of the phone’s frame, making it just wide enough for that little gasket to land on but tight enough to keep water out.

* In addition, logic board cable connectors from the battery and the display, along with the Lightning port and the actual buttons, utilize a tiny silicon seal to prevent water damage.
* Apple’s Taptic Engine in the iPhone 6s Plus is a lot smaller than the one found inside its smaller brother, the iPhone 6s. Specially, the iPhone 6s Plus’s Taptic Engine measures 15mm wide, 8 mm tall and 4.9 mm deep compared to the 35 mm x 6 mm x 3.2 mm one found in the iPhone 6s.
* “Our guess as to the reason for the substantially smaller footprint: Apple didn’t want to shave off too much from the already-scaled-down battery,” explains iFixit.
* And while the new twelve-megapixel iSight shooters in the new phones are fairly similar, the additional heft of the optical image stabilization hardware in the iPhone 6s Plus camera is “readily apparent.”
* iFixit has identified the following chips inside the 5.5-inch handset:

* Repair of this device is similar to previous generations, requiring screwdrivers and prying tools. Both the display assembly and the battery are easy to replace and removing them requires a proprietary Pentalobe screwdriver and knowledge of the adhesive removal technique.
* Thankfully, all of the internal screws in the new iPhones are Phillips screws.
