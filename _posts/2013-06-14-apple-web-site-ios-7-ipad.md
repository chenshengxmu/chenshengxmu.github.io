* Despite CEO Tim Cook’s management shakeup last year, Apple’s marketing and website departments don’t seem to collaborate closely enough. In what could only be attributed to a human error, image files discovered on Apple’s website earlier today offered a glimpse into iOS 7 icons different from the current iOS 7 Beta 1.
* Another find involves graphics outlining device compatibility, with an image depicting iOS 7 running on the iPad and iPad mini…
* The French blog iGen.fr passes along the top shot spotted at the bottom Apple’s iOS 7 Features web page. If anything, it tells us iOS 7 won’t look any different on iPads compared to the iPhone and iPod touch.
* For what it’s worth, it’s been sitting there since Monday’s WWDC 2013 keynote.
* Apple disappointed WWDC developers who were hoping to get their hands on the iPad build of iOS 7. The iPad version, executives said, needs some time perfecting and will be posted to Apple’s portal for developers at a later stage.
* iGen also spotted another image depicting the iOS 7 Music app on a bigger canvas.

* Again, pretty much what you’d expect and consistent with the iPhone build.
* There’s not much else to be gleaned from these images.
* A red icon on the Home screen, you say (third on the left in the third row)?
* That’s probably Photo Booth for iPad.
* Speaking of which, how about making an iPhone version of this fun app?
* And while we’re at it, can you please port the gorgeous iOS 7 Weather app to the iPad?
