* This is an easy-to-follow guide aimed at folks who are in the market for an external display for their MacBook or MacBook Pro. These laptops feature USB-C ports exclusively, so if you want to hook them up to a display without the need for dongles, you’ll need to find one that supports the tech.
* Since the USB-C port is relatively new, there aren’t a ton of monitors out there that are compatible with it just yet. But as usual we’ve taken the time to track down the best USB-C monitors for MacBook and MacBook Pro available, based on a variety of factors, including price, features, expert and user reviews, and of course our own experiences.
* As aforementioned, Apple’s latest MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops feature USB-C ports—and only USB-C ports. The 12-inch Retina MacBook has one, the entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro has two, and all other MacBook Pro models have four. There are plenty of cables, dongles and adapters out there that will allow you to go, say from USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort, but those wanting a simple, out-of-the-box connection will want to look at USB-C compatible displays.
* And really, other than the fact that it’s a newer (and therefore, not yet widely available) bit of tech, USB-C isn’t a bad thing. The connectors are reversible, so you don’t have to worry about your cables being upside down, and it’s extremely versatile, capable of transferring everything from data, to video—even power. In fact, if you can find a USB-C display that meets your feature and price requirements, it’s easily the best way to go. One cable, great image and sound quality, no adapters.
* The answer to this question is fairly straightforward. First, obviously, you’ll want to make sure the monitor meets all of your needs: is it the right size and price? Does it have the features you want like built-in speakers or USB 3.0 ports? Once you’ve determined these things, it should be easy to narrow down your options.
* There is one other thing to look for: USB-C PD or Power Delivery. This means you can connect one USB-C cable, from your laptop to your monitor, for both external display and power. Without it you’ll need a USB-C cable from your laptop to the display, and a second USB-C cable connected to your power brick. That also means you’re taking up two of your laptops USB-C ports—which is all you have in some models. So if possible, look for the USB-C PD symbol and ensure it’s rated for your laptop’s power supply.
* Hopefully we can help you answer a lot of these questions below. Here are some of the best USB-C displays/monitors available right now.
