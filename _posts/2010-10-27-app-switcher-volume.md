* This is a boring day for the jailbreak community. After checking out the somewhat useless EZDecline this morning, we’re now having a quick look at App Switcher Volume, a new jailbreak application that adds a volume slider to the “now playing” bar of your app switcher.
* That’s all it does and really, for $0.99, I sure hope it does it well…
* Does that look interesting enough to download?
