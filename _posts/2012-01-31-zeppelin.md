* I’ve never been a huge fan of carriers advertising themselves by means of the carrier logo in my iPhone’s status bar. For that reason I usually remove them with a tweak like CleanStatus or Springtomize 2.
* But Zeppelin — a new jailbreak tweak that just appeared on Cydia — has me considering carrier logos again…
* Zeppelin allows you to add any of the following carrier logos to your iPhone’s status bar:
* All of the logos are high quality and accurate representations. Once you select your logo, simply respring to apply the change to your status bar.
* Personally I’m not a big proponent of carrier logos, custom or otherwise, but Zeppelin make it so easy and it looks so good. Better yet, it’s free of charge for jailbreakers on Cydia.
* Which carrier logo will you choose?
