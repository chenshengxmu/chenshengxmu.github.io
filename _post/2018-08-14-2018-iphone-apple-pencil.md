* With just weeks to go before Apple’s expected to reveal three new iPhones for 2018, two new rumors have emerged. TrendForce suggests at least one of the new handsets could support Apple Pencil while two will offer 512GB in storage. Both would be firsts for the product line. 
* Updated: Another report says Apple Pencil support is coming to some 2018 iPhones.
* The Tuesday report doesn’t say which of the new iPhones would support Apple Pencil, only that it “would be offered as an option.” Also, it expects Apple to offer the 512GB storage option on two of the three new handsets, the second-generation 5.8-inch iPhone X and 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus. I would argue Apple Pencil support would probably be extended to these same two handsets.

* Rumors have long suggested Cupertino plans on announcing three new iPhones this year. In addition to the two AMOLED-based models mentioned above, the company is also expected to release a 6.1-inch LCD model.
* All three handsets are expected to feature Face ID and a True-Depth camera system and feature some new color combinations. Previous rumors have also said starting prices for this year’s smartphones should be $699 for the LCD model, $899 for the second-generation iPhone X, and $999 for the iPhone X Plus.
* A Monday report said Fubon Securities and Foxconn will assemble the second-generation iPhone X, 90 percent of the units for the iPhone X Plus and 75 percent of the total for the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone. Taiwan-based Pegatron is fulfilling the remaining orders during this cycle.
* Last week, it was suggested Apple could hold its annual iPhone event on Wednesday, Sept. 12. To date, Apple has been mum on when this event will take place. Regardless, we should hear soon enough. Apple typically holds a fall event after Labor Day in the United States. This year, that holiday falls on Monday, Sept. 3.
