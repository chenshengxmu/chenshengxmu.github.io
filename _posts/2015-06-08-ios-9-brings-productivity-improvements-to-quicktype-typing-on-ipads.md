* Apple has said that people using iOS 9 on their iPads will be more productive thanks to an improved QuickType virtual keyboard. The suggestion bar introduced in iOS 8 now has all-new handy shortcuts to format your content, move between apps quickly, position the cursor and even multitask like a pro with an OS X-style task switcher translucent UI with active app icons.
* Located right at the top of the QuickType keyboard, the all-new bar provides access to handy shortcuts to cut, copy and paste text. You also get shortcuts for rich text formatting, accessing attachments and your photos and much more.
* Probably the coolest feature of the improved QuickType keyboard is the ability to move a cursor by dragging: just put two fingers on the keyboard and it essentially turns it into a virtual trackpad of sorts, allowing you to position the cursor more precisely and easily than before, no need to use the copy-paste loupe whatsoever.
* How do you like QuickType in iOS 9 so far?
