* Following its January launch in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, Apple is keeping true to its promise by announcing today that the HomePod wireless speaker has been scheduled to expand to Canada, France and Germany on Monday, June 18.
* That’s according to BuzzFeed News today, which said that Apple announced today that the Siri-powered speaker will be available in Canada, France and Germany on June 18.
* Apple has confirmed this in a press release.
* The article also mentioned that the iOS 11.4 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is arriving later today alongside a new HomePod firmware, finally bringing long-delayed features such as AirPlay 2, multi-room audio and stereo pairing to HomePod, Apple TV and iOS.

* HomePod is compatible with iPhone 5s or later, iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad mini 2 or later or the sixth-generation iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* Even though Google, not Amazon, now leads the smart speaker market, the iPhone maker has apparently become the fourth-largest smart speaker brand worldwide. Google and Amazon, however, sell speakers that start at just $49 while HomePod is priced at $349.

* Per supply chain reports, the Cupertino firm may be planning to address the situation with a cheaper $199 HomePod model that may or may not be promoted under the Beats brand.
