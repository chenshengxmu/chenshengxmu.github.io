* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Colorcube. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the colorful puzzler for free on both iPhone and iPad—a nice little savings of a buck.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Calming colors? Check. Ambient soundtrack? Check. A refreshingly simple premise? Check. Colorcube has all the right ingredients for the perfect chill-out session at the end of a long day. With hundreds of levels to complete, this deceptively challenging game is as stimulating as it is serene…and surprisingly compelling to boot.
* And here is a clip of the game in action:
* Colorcube is available in the App Store for free.
