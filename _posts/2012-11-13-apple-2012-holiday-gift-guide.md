* With winter holidays upon us, Apple has now launched its official Holiday Gift Guide for this year. A special page on the company’s web site is now live, highlighting a range of first and third-party gadgets and accessories that Apple hopes might be a nice guideline for those on the lookout for perfect holiday gift.
* The main four sections group products according to Apple’s major product lineups: iPad gifts, Mac gifts, iPhone gifts and iPod gifts. Fender’s iOS-friendly Stratocaster guitar Cody told you about yesterday (an Apple Store exclusive) is among the listed products, as is the Nike+ FuelBand wrist band accessory, Parrot’s AR Drone and many other gadgets…
* Apple is offering free shipping on the listed products. Just don’t hold your fingers crossed for holiday deals because the 2012 Holiday Gift Guide is just that, a guide which emphasizes products Apple thinks you may wanna consider this holiday season.
* Even though the company usually offers Black Friday savings, they’re nothing to write home about: think up to ten percent off select Macs and iOS devices, at best. Third-party retailers often have deeper discounts on Apple products than the iPhone maker.
* I think I’ll pass on the whole gifting thing this holiday season.
* The best money saved is the money not spent on things I don’t really need.
* That’s just me, of course.
* What about you?
* Let us know about your holiday gift ideas down in the comments.
