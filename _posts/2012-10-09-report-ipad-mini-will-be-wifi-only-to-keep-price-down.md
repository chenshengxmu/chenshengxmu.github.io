* We may have been exposed to a surprising amount of leaks pertaining to the looks and hardware features of a smaller iPad Apple is thought to be introducing later this month. One important feature has remained a mystery thus far: the device’s price point.
* With both Amazon and Google selling their seven inchers for just $199, Apple’s mini iPad cannot and shouldn’t cost substantially more in order not to ruin its chances in the marketplace.
* Among the possible tricks Apple could employ in order to keep the costs down: re-using some of the iPad 2 components and yes – skimping on some features, including cellular networking…
* A report published today by The Guardian newspaper claims the iPad mini will (at least initially) come in WiFi-only flavor, just like Google’s seven-inch Nexus tablet:
* Apple’s expected “iPad mini” will only come in a Wi-Fi version. […] Industry sources indicated to the Guardian that they do not expect to see 3G-capable versions of the iPad mini.
* Why?
* That would allow Apple to produce it comparatively cheaply and to limit the top price of the product, while retaining mobile broadband connectivity for its pricier iPad line.
* Retail sources who spoke to The Guardian on condition of anonymity are calling for a November launch. Fortune previously reported that Apple will tomorrow invite journalists to an iPad mini-focused press conference, thought to be held at some point next week.
* A WiFi-only iPad would be comparable to Google’s Nexus 7, which also does not support cellular networking. However, such a device would compare unfavorably to Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablet which was originally WiFi-only, but was refreshed with cellular networking last month.
* Apple too could quietly introduce a cellular iPad mini down the road. The original iPad landed in the U.S. in April 2010, with WiFi + 3G cellular model arriving the following month.
* The Guardian story also underscores that Apple will release a revised version of the iPad with 4G connectivity compatible with the UK’s Everything Everywhere network.
* Sources also indicated that they expect Apple to refresh the iPad line by following up the introduction of the iPhone 5, which is 4G-capable in the UK through Everything Everywhere’s 1800MHz network – and from next September with Three – with revised versions using the same 1800MHz 4G chip and the new connector.
* The revised device would come with Apple’s new Lightning connector, the story claims. Australian writer Sonny Dickson tweeted this image he said depict an iPad mini with Lightning I/O.
* A squared-off iPad mini could be a design Apple dropped last minute.

* Apple in the past revised the original iPhone mid-cycle, adding more capacious models to the mix just a few months after its release. Google too appears to be pulling a similar maneuver with its Nexus 7 device: Phandroid notes that a new 32GB Nexus 7 is now shipping to some customers. The 16GB model has reportedly been declared “EOL” (end of life).
* So, what do you think Apple will price the iPad mini at?
* If you ask me, it should be somewhere between $249 and $299.
* Why?
* Because the previous-generation iPod touch begins at $199.
* Plus, a $49-$99 premium against the $199 Google/Amazon tablet is easily justifiable by Apple’s design, build quality, choice of apps and the ecosystem that “just works”.
