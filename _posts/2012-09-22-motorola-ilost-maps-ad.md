* Apple has been taking a lot of heat over the past few days regarding its new Maps application. The company released iOS 6, the latest update to its mobile OS, to the public on Wednesday, which features the new Google Maps replacement.
* Inaccuracies and missing features in the app have spawned a parody Tumblr and Twitter account, in addition to quite the uproar in the tech world. And it looks like Motorola is looking to capitalize on the criticism, with its new “iLost” ad…
* AndroidCentral points to a new advertisement that just popped up on Motorola’s Google+ page that features the iPhone 5 and Motorola’s new Droid RAZR M. Each has their respective Maps app loaded, and as you can see, Apple’s looks inferior.
* “Looking for 315 E 15th in Manhattan? Google Maps on DROID RAZR M will get you there & not #iLost in Brooklyn.
* The real world that’s fit for your hand”
* There’s no question that Apple’s Maps app comes up short compared to Google’s. Google has been doing this for 7 years, and has thousands of people on its payroll collecting data via planes, trains and automobiles. And Apple is, well, hiring.
* The company released a statement last Thursday regarding the Maps criticism, saying that it’s aware that Maps is a “major initiative” and that it is “just getting started with it.” And it promised that the service will continue to get better over time.
* Motorola has struggled to stay relevant in the smartphone era, albeit a few standout hits like the original Droid and the long-lasting Droid RAZR Maxx. So you can’t fault them for trying something new. And it’ll be interesting to see if it pays off.
* What do you think of Motorola’s new ad?
