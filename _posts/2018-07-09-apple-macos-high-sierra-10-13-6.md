* Apple has released macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. The update comes just a few hours after Cupertino launched iOS 11.4.1, HomePod 11.4.1, tvOS 11.4.1, and watchOS 4.3.2.
* Here are the full release notes for today’s update:
* The macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 update adds AirPlay 2 multi-room audio support for iTunes and improves the stability and security of your Mac. This update is recommended for all users.
* AirPlay 2 for iTunes – Control your home audio system and AirPlay 2-enabled speakers throughout your house – Play music at the same time on multiple AirPlay 2-enabled speakers in your house, all in sync
* Other improvements and fixes – Fixes an issue that may prevent Photos from recognizing AVCHD media from some cameras – Fixes an issue that may prevent Mail users from moving a message from Gmail to another account
* Today’s release is probably the last one for macOS High Sierra 10.13, which was released last year. In September, Apple’s likely to release macOS Mojave 10.14, which was introduced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June.
