* First introduced in August 2017, HQ Trivia typically airs two games each day, at 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern. Most games feature 12 multiple choice questions that must be answered within 10 seconds. Those who answer all the questions split the grand prize. If there isn’t a winner, the jackpot is rolled over to the next day’s prize.
* Usually hosted by Scott Rogowky, HQ Trivia once only offered $250 for each game. The minimum jackpot is now $3,000. Prizes on Sundays, holidays and special events have risen to as high as $400,000. Winnings are typically paid out using PayPal.
* To get started on HQ, you’ll need to enter your cell phone number, then enter the verification code you receive. About 30 minutes before each game begins, you can post a message on the HQ Trivia board as you wait or stay quiet and concentrate. The game starts after some funny banter from Rogowky or another host.
* You can download HQ Trivia from the App Store and now through the Apple TV App Store.
