title: ScreenRecorder Records Everything You Do On Your iPhone
---
* ScreenRecorder is a new application by Elton Bolzanac that allows you to record a video of your iPhone screen. Per the description of the app:
* This application let’s you take video captures of your screen. This is extremely useful for quick tutorials or demonstrations, or when you want to show proof of a new hack you have accomplished. There are obviously many other uses for this. For example, you could use this like a “Notes” application, but with video instead of words!
* Keep in mind that video recording is a very intense process, so crashing is very frequent on videos that have a capture time of more than 45 seconds.
* I haven’t tried this app myself but from what I understand it is pretty unstable. While it sounds like a very promising app, I think it’s a little pricey at $1.99. Maybe a few updates to make it more stable will make this app very useful.
* Have you tried ScreenRecorder yet? If so, please share your thought by leaving a comment.
