* AnimateLockscreen is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows you to add animation to your iPhone’s Lock screen. Because it uses boot logo animations to accomplish the effect, it means that there are almost 1,000 different animations that you can enjoy right out of the box.
* If you’re looking to add some splash to your iPhone’s Lock screen, and a static wallpaper just isn’t enough, then AnimateLockscreen is the next logical choice. It should be available soon on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, but until then, have a look at our video walkthrough…
* AnimateLockscreen features a boatload of settings that will delight those of you who like to get your hands dirty. There are lots of fiddly settings; the ability to resize and move the Lock screen battery on the X and Y axis comes to mind. There are also options geared towards tweakers that allow you to adjust the animation time, disable the battery while charging, and activate your own custom background.
* This is shaping up to be a nice tweak, because it’s simple enough to use for those who just want an animated Lock screen and nothing more, but deep enough to satisfy hardcore tinkerers. AnimateLockscreen will be available in the near future on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.00. Sound compelling enough for you?
