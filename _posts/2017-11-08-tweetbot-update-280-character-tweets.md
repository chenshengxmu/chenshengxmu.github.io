* The popular third-party Twitter client Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad was updated on App Store earlier this morning with support for the newly expanded tweet length limit.
* The update arrives hot on the heels of yesterday’s news that Twitter was doubling the per-tweet limit from 140 to 280 characters for all users following a test in September.
* Aside from gaining support for posting longer tweets, no other changes are mentioned in release notes accompanying Tweetbot for iOS 4.7.9, which requires iOS 10.3 or later.
* Support for polls is still non-existent in third-party Twitter clients because there’s no public API for that from Twitter as of yet. Tweetbot for Mac was not updated at post time with support for 280-character tweets, but an update should be due soon.
* Other popular Twitter clients, including Twitterrific, are expected to follow in Tweetbot’s footsteps and implement support for Twitter’s new 280-character limit for tweets.
* Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad is a $4.99 download from App Store.
