* Affinity Designer, a professional illustrator app for macOS, is now available on iPad with Apple Pencil support and a bunch of advanced features, and it costs just $13.99.
* Affinity Designer for iPad is something special, even more so considering that there has never been a full-on illustrator app for the Apple tablet. Affinity Designer for iPad includes an array of professional drawing tools and a complete vector toolset with robust CMYK and file format support.

* Affinity Designer for iPad uses Apple’s Metal graphics engine to help convert all the power and precision of the desktop app into a stunning mobile experience.

* At $13.99, Affinity Designer for iPad is a steal considering that professional productivity and content creation apps usually command a steep price.
* Last year saw the launch of Affinity Photo for the iPad, another great creator app by Serif.
* Grab Affinity Designer from App Store for $13.99 before the price goes up.
