* Have you lost your Siri Remote? Would you like to control Apple TV with your iPhone or iPad? The good news is, you can do just that, right from within Control Center on iOS 11 and later.
* If you’ve misplaced your remote, don’t despair.
* Although you can always purchase another Siri Remote or get one of the older ones, think twice—especially with the standalone Siri Remote still a bit on the pricey side at $59.
* TUTORIAL: How to stop Apple TV keyboard notification on iPhone
* Another solution would be to program your universal infrared remote so you can control your Apple TV with it, which is rather clunky and not very intuitive.
* Instead, learn how to elegantly control Apple TV with your iOS device.
* This tutorial assumes you have the following:
* Both your Apple TV and iOS device must be on the same Wi-Fi network,
* Follow these steps if you’re on iOS 11 or up:
* 1) Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 11 or later.
* 2) Tap Control Center.
* 3) Tap Customize Controls.
* 4) Tap “+” next to Apple TV Remote underneath the heading More Controls, then touch and hold next to the control and drag it to a desired position.

* 5) Close out the Settings app, then open the Control Center overlay.
* 6) Tap the Apple TV Remote widget you just added.
* 7) Choose your Apple TV from the list.

* 8) If asked, enter the 4-digit code that appears on your Apple TV screen.
* Congratulations, you can now navigate your Apple TV via the Control Center interface on iOS, control your media playback, use Siri and play games with tilt controls.
* NOTE: If your iPhone or iPad is running iOS 12 or later and you also own an Apple TV, iOS will discover your set-top box on the local network and automatically add the Apple TV Remote widget to Control Center, making it even easier to navigate the entirety of the tvOS user interface and access Apple TV controls from the comfort of your sofa.

* iOS 12 automatically adds this widget to Control Center for Apple TV owners
* We’re not going to lay out the full instructions on using the controls the widget provides because both Sandy and I published relevant tutorials covering that, so read them if you like.
* Just in case, here’s a quick recap of the available controls:
* This widget facilitates text input on Apple TV, too: first use the remote to highlight any text field in an app on your Apple TV, like the search field in the YouTube app, then press a notification that pops up on the screen of your nearby iOS device to enter text using the iOS keyboard.

* Don’t see the keyboard notification?
* Be sure to set Allow Notifications to off in Settings → Notifications on your iPhone.
