* Just grabbed a brand new iPhone 4S? Are you a new iPhone user? If you want to learn more about your new device, then the iPhone 4S user guide might be for you.

* Simply click here to access to iPhone 4S user guide. Because it is online, you will obviously need an internet connection.
* The user guide is broken down into several categories. From the basics to more advanced functions, it should cover your basis, especially if you never owned an iPhone or iPod before.
