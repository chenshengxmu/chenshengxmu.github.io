* In case you haven’t heard, Apple is planning on building a new headquarters in Cupertino. The project has been proposed by Steve Jobs himself to the Cupertino City Council, and the Mayor of Cupertino has confirmed that the city plans on supporting Apple in its move to a larger and more exterrestrial building.
* Apple currently has around 12,000 employees located in Cupertino, California that work at the current Infinite Loop campus and surrounding buildings. Steve Jobs is excited about the new HQ, because all 12,000 employees will finally be under one (curved glass) roof.
* Did we mention that the building looks like a UFO?
* Steve Jobs explained the concept for the new Apple campus to the Cupertino City Council,
* “It’s a pretty amazing building. It’s a little like a spaceship landed. It’s got this gorgeous courtyard in the middle… It’s a circle. It’s curved all the way around. If you build things, this is not the cheapest way to build something. There is not a straight piece of glass in this building. It’s all curved. We’ve used our experience making retail buildings all over the world now, and we know how to make the biggest pieces of glass in the world for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building… It’s pretty cool.”
* A giant, circular building made entirely out of curved glass? Sounds like something that only Apple would do.
* The 4-story, eco-friendly building will house 12,000 employees and have underground parking. The entire campus will generate its own energy. The center of the UFO-shaped structure will be home to about 6,000 trees and apricot orchards.
* Interestingly, Apple bought the 98-acre campus from HP last year. This is significant to Steve Jobs because Hewlett-Packard’s founders, Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett, offered Mr. Jobs a summer job before he was CEO of Apple in 1969.
* Apple plans to revolutionize the company’s day-to-day operations at Cupertino with this new headquarters, and Steve Jobs has assured locals that this new mothership is what Apple needs to continue growing as a company. Apple plans on building a new presentation room in the campus for media events, so that the company doesn’t have to travel to San Francisco to announce new products.
* Ken Segall, the former Creative Director at Apple, said it best,
* “To Steve, designing and building his new company home is no different than designing and building an Apple product.”
* So when will the iSpaceship be completed? Apple estimates the unveiling of the new campus to be sometime in 2015.
* If you’re interested, you can watch the presentation that Steve Jobs made to the City Council about this new campus.
