* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Cut the Rope: Magic. For the next 7 days, you can download the popular title for free on both iPhone and iPad—saving you a buck.
* For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Cut The Rope features a candy-craving creature named Om Nom that solves physics-puzzles in exchange for treats. This episode features more than new 160 puzzles.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Our beloved Om Nom is on another quest for candy, and not even the supernatural will get in the way of his sweet tooth. Featuring a totally revamped (and gorgeous) visual style and tons of new gameplay elements, Cut the Rope: Magic totally transforms the series—as well as our hungry hero. For the first time ever, Om Nom can morph into all sorts of creatures—from a bird to a baby to a mouse—to solve each enchanting puzzle.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Cut the Rope: Magic is available in the App Store for free.
