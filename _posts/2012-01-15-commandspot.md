* Want to launch apps, reboot, respring, or turn off your iDevice right from your Spotlight search? If so, then all you need is a jailbroken device with CommandSpot installed.
* CommandSpot is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to execute specific commands to launch apps, Twitter, Facebook, and quite a few other things. It’s not the most efficient way to perform these functions, but it can be done nonetheless.
* I have to say that I don’t really see the point of doing this. It’s much, much slower than just launching apps the old fashion way, and it’s even worse when Apple’s autocorrect kicks in and throws off your command.
* Not only that, but there are a lot of Spotlight tweaks already that perform similar functions in a more efficient manner.
* CommandSpot is available on Cydia for free. If you decide to take it for a spin, let us know what you thought about it.
