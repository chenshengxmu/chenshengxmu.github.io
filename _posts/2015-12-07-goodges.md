* Goodges is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you swap out app icon badges for app icon labels. In other words, the tweak is designed to showcase a label notifying you of pending notifications, instead of the traditional badge.
* If you find app icon badges to be unsightly, then Goodges is a free tweak that you should consider. It allows you to see pending notifications for specific apps, without being subjected to the ugly badges that litter your Home screen.

* Once Goodges is installed, you can configure it via the stock Settings app. The settings, which are laid out quite nicely, allow you to change the way that the app label notifications look.
* The Label options section lets you bold text, capitalize the first letter of a notification, change the color of a label notification, and more. You can even choose to highlight labels via the Highlighting options section, which will make pending notification labels more noticeable.

* There’s even the ability to change label notification naming on a per-app basis. Most notifications default to “1 notification”, but you can change it to say whatever you wish, such as “1 DM” if, for example, you only have notifications for Direct Messages enabled in the Tweetbot app. Apps like Cydia and the App Store have this wording changed to “update”, so pending notifications show “1 update” or “3 updates”, for instance.
* The great thing about Goodges is that it can be customized and tailored to your liking. If you don’t like the look of the typical red app icon badge notifications, then you should consider giving Goodges a try. It’s a free jailbreak tweak available now on Cydia.
