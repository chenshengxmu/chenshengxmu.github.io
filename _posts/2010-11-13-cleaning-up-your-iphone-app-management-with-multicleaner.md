title: Cleaning Up Your iPhone App Management with MultiCleaner
---
* Do you hate how your iPhone leaves app icons in the multitasking bar even though they aren’t running anymore? How about when you have to go through that tedious process to exit an app; click the home button twice, tap and hold an icon in the multitasking bar, wait for it to jiggle, and then click that tiny red delete button to quit.

* Luckily, there are other people that feel the same way. MultiCleaner is a jailbreak app that relieves the cumbersomeness of managing your multitasking apps. In fact, the app’s tagline is quite simple, “Because iOS 4 multitasking sucks…”

* MultiCleaner fixes some annoying issues with the way iOS handles multitasking app management. The app quite literally cleans up your multitasking bar so that it displays only the processes that are actually still running. For whatever reason, iOS shows way more icons in the multitasking bar by default than need should have it.
* I don’t need to see the app that I opened two days ago that isn’t running anymore. I only want to see the apps that are currently running in the background. MultiCleaner makes that want a reality. MultiCleaner also allows you to effectively quit an app without having to kill the process manually in the multitasking bar.

* No matter what app you’re in, you can hold the home button for a couple of seconds and you are given an option to permanently quit the app with the tap of a finger. This function works like an Activator shortcut.
* You can customize your MultiCleaner experience on an app-by-app basis in a very comprehensive settings pane.

* Each app you manually add to MultiCleaner can be managed in its own specific way. You decide. Managing the way an app behaves in the multitasking bar, creating specific quit shortcuts,  and editing white and black lists of apps are just some things that you can do with MultiCleaner.
* I highly recommend this multitasking add-on. There are other multitasking alternatives out there, like Multifl0w, but MultiCleaner brings some features to the table that I haven’t found anywhere else.
* Pick MultiCleaner up for only $0.99 in the Cydia store.
* What do you think? Do you, or will you, use MultiCleaner?
