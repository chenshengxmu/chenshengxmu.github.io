* It seems that everybody in Asia and their mother have some spare iPhone 5 parts to share with the web at large. A new report is out today with a pair of images showing the purported front assembly of the next iPhone, meticulously disassembled in a true teardown analysis manner…
* The French blog NowhereElse points to a pair of image sourced from iColorOS that show all the parts thought to make up the iPhone 5 front assembly.
* Here you can see a bunch of internal sensors, the volume control circuitry, the smaller home button and the glass display.
* Note that the above image also depicts what looks to be a Nano SIM tray that NowheeElse first leaked on Monday.
* Here’s that smaller drawer compared to the MicroSIM drawer used on the iPhone 4/4S, from four days ago.

* NowhereElse is increasingly becoming the source of late iPhone 5 rumors as we approach the rumored September 12 announcement.
* Just yesterday, the site pointed to a Chinese newspaper report claiming that the iPhone 5 will be just 7.6mm thick (versus 9.3mm for the iPhone 4/4S) and published a bunch of gorgeous renders depicting what holding a four-inch iPhone with a taller display could feel like.
* The blog also published a full on image of the purported iPhone 5 dock connector which clearly shows a metal ring inside the casing cutout, suggesting MagSafe-like functionality.
* What do you think about this iPhone 5 front assembly?
* Perhaps you can glean other interesting tidbits from these shots?
