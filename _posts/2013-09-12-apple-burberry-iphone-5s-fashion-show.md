* Fashion retailer Burberry (not to be mistaken for BlackBerry) just announced that it will be using Apple’s new iPhone 5s to capture images and photographs at the upcoming high-profile fashion show scheduled to run in London next week. Not only will Burberry be using the improved iSight camera on the iPhone 5s to shoot stills and video, they’ll be also taking high-quality shots to document runway and beauty looks, product details and backstage moments. And I bet they’ve opted for gold devices…
* Christopher Bailey, Burberry Chief Creative Officer, says the two companies share design expertise and craftsmanship. “We have a mutual passion for creating beautiful products and unlocking emotive experiences through technology, which has made it intensely exciting to explore the capabilities of iPhone 5s,” he said.
* Wow, what a nice endorsement!

* File this one as a nice marketing stunt which should help raise awareness about the iPhone 5s ahead of its September 20 release. It’s curious that Apple opted not to put up the flagship device for pre-order, unlike the iPhone 5c which is available to pre-order starting tomorrow.
* A media release also quotes Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone & iOS Product Marketing:
* iPhone 5s makes it even easier to take great photos with the world’s most popular camera. We’re thrilled to see the amazing photos and HD video Burberry has captured with the incredible all-new iSight camera.
* It’s not just marketing talk.
* Apple’s new top-line iPhone 5s does pack a lot of punch in the camera department.

* Instead of ratcheting up the megapixel count, Apple opted for camera tweaks and improvements across the board, starting with a 15 percent larger sensor with larger pixels (1.5 microns) which allows for better photos.
* There’s also a larger ƒ/2.2 aperture to let more light in.
* Here’s a test shot by Burberry, taking with an iPhone 5s.
* Coupled with an impressive 33 percent increase in light sensitivity, dual LED-flash and way faster media processing engine – courtesy of the 64-bit A7 chip – the camera can take up to ten full-resolution images per second and will automatically capture burst shots in order to present the sharpest, best-looking image.

* The Burberry Prorsum Spring/Summer 2014 runway show will take place on Monday, September 16, at 2:30pm London time. It’ll be available to view live and on-demand over at the Burberry website.
* Apple’s design guru Jony Ive is friends with Christopher Bailey and attended the show last year so perhaps he’ll be making a cameo appearance next week?
