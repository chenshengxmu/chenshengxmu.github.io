* Folks with newer devices on iOS 5.1 will be happy to hear that iH8sn0w has uncovered a new loophole that could potentially allow users to downgrade their A5 gadgets to the more jailbreak-friendly iOS 5.0.1 in the near future.
* As noted by Gadgetsteria, the Sn0wBreeze creator announced yesterday via his Twitter account that he has uncovered a ‚Äúloophole‚Äù in Apple‚Äôs APticket system that allowed him to downgrade his iPad 2 from 5.1 to 5.0.1‚Ä¶
* Here‚Äôs the tweet:
* Found a loophole in Apple‚Äôs apticket system. Restored my iPad 2 to 5.0.1 from 5.1. Works on all A5 devices. üôÇ

* This is actually a pretty big deal, considering there isn‚Äôt currently a jailbreak available for A5 devices (untethered or otherwise) on iOS 5.1. Nor is there a method of downgrading the firmware on these devices at this time.
* Chances are you‚Äôll need saved SHSH blobs from iOS 5.0.1 for whatever hardware you‚Äôre looking to downgrade, but we won‚Äôt know anything for sure until we see an official release. And unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any kind of ETA.
* As always, we‚Äôll let you know more as soon as we do. So stay tuned.
