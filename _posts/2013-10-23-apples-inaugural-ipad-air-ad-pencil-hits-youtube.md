* You’ve read all there is to know about Apple’s iPad Air, watched Jony Ive talk enthusiastically about the crazy attention to detail that had gone into designing the product – perhaps streamed or even downloaded the entire keynote to your computer – and now you can appreciate Apple’s inaugural, feel-good, mission-statement iPad Air ad.
* This is the same 60-second commercial that was played to the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts audience yesterday, and now it’s just gone live over at Apple’s YouTube channel. It’s included for your viewing pleasure right after the fold and I urge you to give it a watch and join the discussion down in the comments…
* And here it is.

* The ad says:
* It’s an extremely simple tool, but also extremely powerful. It can be used to start a poem or finish a symphony. It has transformed the way we work, learn, create, share…
* It’s used to illustrate things, solve things and think of new things. It’s used by scientists and artists, scholars and students. It’s been to classrooms, boardrooms, expeditions – even space.
* And we can’t wait to see where you’ll take it next.
* Introducing the thinner, lighter, more powerful iPad Air.
* So, your thoughts?
* Pretty found of the new voiceover guy – I could listen to that Jeff-like radio voice all day long.
