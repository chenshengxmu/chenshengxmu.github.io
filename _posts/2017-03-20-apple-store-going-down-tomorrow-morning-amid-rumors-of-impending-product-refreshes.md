* Reputable supply chain analysts recently told MacRumors Apple could announce new products between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24. Well, today Apple did something it’s never done before—via its System Status webpage, the firm announced that its online stores will be undergoing maintenance tomorrow morning, March 21.
* “The Apple Store will be updated and unavailable during this time,” reads the message first spotted by MacRumors. It’s become a tradition for Apple to take its store offline ahead of major media events and product launches.
* Apple Online Store will be undergoing maintenance tomorrow, March 21, between 8:00am and 1:30pm. All users will be affected.
* Apple hasn’t sent out any invites for an impending media event, suggesting any updates tomorrow would take the form of a press release and a silent website refresh rather than a major announcement of a trio of new iPad Pro models.
* It’s also possible that this could be an ordinary maintenance, period.

* For what it’s worth, Apple typically publishes press releases at 8:30am Eastern Time.
* It’s interesting that Photo Products service are scheduled to undergo maintenance during the same period. “Photo Print Products will be updated and unavailable during this time,” reads the message.
* This points to the possibility of impending updates to features in Photos and other apps that let customers order prints of photographs directly from their devices.
* A reliable Japanese blog, which shared accurate information about Apple’s unreleased products in the past, said recently that a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro model could launch this week, running a faster variant of iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip.
* What do you think Apple may release tomorrow?
