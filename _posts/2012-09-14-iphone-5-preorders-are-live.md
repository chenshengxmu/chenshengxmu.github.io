* Well, they were a little late, but Apple is now taking pre-orders for the iPhone 5. If you live in one of the initial launch countries, you should be able to log into Apple’s website and snag a handset.
* Hopefully, the company has planned ahead this time for the influx in traffic, and we won’t have to spend forever trying to place our orders. Last year it took me 2 hours to pre-order the iPhone 4S…
* Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like unlocked handsets will be available for US customers to pre-order. But we’ll let you know if we find out differently while we’re placing our orders.
* And remember, if for some reason you can’t get your order to go through Apple’s website, you can try your carrier. Verizon, AT&T and Sprint are all taking online pre-orders this morning.
* Still trying to decide which carrier and model to go with, or if you’re getting one at all? These posts may help:
* So, have you pre-ordered your iPhone 5 yet?
