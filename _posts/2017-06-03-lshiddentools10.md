* The Lock screen is the first thing you see every time you wake your device up, whether it’s coming out of your pocket or you’re grabbing at it for the first time of the day from your nightstand.
* That said, why not use your jailbreak to customize your Lock screen? A new free jailbreak tweak called LSHiddenTools10 by CydiaGeek will allow you to do just that.
* With this tweak, you can hide a bevy of the things from the Lock screen. Whether you’re looking for a simpler look overall, or you simply dislike some of the stuff that appear on it normally, the tweak comes with a handful of options for floating your boat.
* To configure the tweak, you can open the new preferences pane via the Settings app after installation:

* Here, you’ll find the following options:
* After changing the settings, you can tap on the blue Respring button at the bottom of the pane to save your changes.
* Subtle changes like disabling access to the camera and hiding Siri app suggestions can be useful depending on how you use your device, but aesthetic changes like hiding the padlock icon, the page dots, and the date from the Today page can help if you don’t like seeing certain elements of the Lock screen.
* Although all of the options aren’t for everybody, there are enough of them included in the package that even one or two of them might be useful for the average jailbreaker.
* If you’re interested in giving LSHiddenTools10 a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
