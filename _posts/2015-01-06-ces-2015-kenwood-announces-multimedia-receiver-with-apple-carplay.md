* The DDX9902S will support both CarPlay for iPhone users and Android Auto for Android Phone users – a pretty common theme we’ve been seeing at CES 2015. It features a touchscreen, with the ability to add a rear-view camera and maneuver safely with on-screen parking guide lines, and compatibility with factory steering wheel audio controls.
* “We understand that consumers are loyal to the brand or platform of smartphone they use,” Tony Mercado, marketing manager for Kenwood, said. “To that end, we wanted to create a multimedia receiver that doesn’t force the customer to choose based on his or her preferred smartphone.”
* CarPlay will work with all Lightning-enabled iPhones (currently the 5, 5C, 5S, 6 / 6 Plus), allowing users to access Siri: Eyes Free mode, Apple Maps, telephone, music, and iMessage from their in-car dash. Right now, Volkswagen is touting MIB II (and subsequently CarPlay) in its Golf automobile.
* The DDX9902S also comes with Bluetooth integration for safer phone calls and wireless music pulled from a paired smartphone, and support for Pandora and iHeartRadio. Solutions like what Kenwood offer are great for users who don’t have a newer vehicle that has CarPlay built-in.
* Kenwood hasn’t announced pricing or availability for the DDX9902S, but says it will have more details soon.
