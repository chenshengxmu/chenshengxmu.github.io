* Since it was unveiled on June 10, 2013, iOS 7 has seen six beta and one final GM releases before it was made available to the general public today. If the overall look and feel of iOS 7 hasn’t changed much since Apple first demo’d it on stage during WWDC, the mobile operating system has been constantly improved on with the usual “bug fixes and stability enhancements,” but most importantly with new features.
* These new iOS 7 features are sometimes obvious, but often very subtle. Over the course of the last three months, we’ve made it our mission to build a list of features that are new to iOS 7. It is not an exhaustive list, but this is probably as comprehensive as it gets. If you want to know all iOS 7 can do for you, you’ve come to the right place…
* Note that we didn’t necessarily focus on the design aspect of things in iOS 7, but rather on features. This means that we didn’t list every new design element.
* These new features are sorted by application. For a complete list of what was new in every beta release, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the applicable beta release.
* If there are any features you think should be added to this list, please feel free to leave a comment or send us an email at tips@iDownloadBlog.com
