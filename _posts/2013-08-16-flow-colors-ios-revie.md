title: Flow Colors treats you to a colorfully addictive puzzle game
---
* Puzzle games can be fun when done right. There are some that are too repetitive and are ultimately overshadowed by too many clones and copycats. Too much of the same thing can sour any genre.

* Flow Colors is an interesting and unique puzzle game that makes you think about the path you take and whether there is something better to be done…
* The game board is simple. It features a grid with a certain number of squares. The grid has a handful of colored squares, each with a match. For example, there may be two blue, two orange, and two yellow squares. These are connector ends. Your goal is to connect one end to the other while filling in all of the squares on the grid.
* When you touch the screen, a transparent circle appears to highlight where your finger is on the screen. This is helpful because you can easily get lost when the grid gets bigger and the squares get smaller.
* There are six “packs” of 60 puzzles. Each pack features a larger grid with more squares. The “Warm-Up” pack has a grid with 5 x 5 squares while the “Medium” pack features a grid with 7 x 7 squares, and so on.
* There is also a Time trial level where your puzzle solving skills are put to the test.
* In the Settings section, you can change the background color theme from white to black. You can also change or remove the touch highlighter if it is too distracting. This game is optimized for compatibility with colorblind players. In colorblind mode, colors are designated with corresponding numbers.

* The goal of each puzzle is to connect two matching colors. All colors must be matched and every square on the grid must be filled in. At first, it is fairly simple to connect the colors. Straight lines or “L” shaped pathways are the most complex route to take.
* However, after about 15 rounds in Warm-Up, things start to get heated. It becomes much more difficult to see the pathway to completing the puzzle. Sometimes, connecting two colors seems impossible, no matter how many different ways you try. Other times, you’ll be able to connect the colors, but there will be one or two blank squares that you just can’t figure out how to fill.
* For example, if a red square and a blue square are diagonal from each other and their partner is in a similar position at the other end of the grid, you must figure out how to connect the two paths without crossing over each other. To make matters worse, you must also fill in every square, so a straight path is not always the right way to go.
* Each pack can be unlocked by playing a certain number of puzzles. For example, you can unlock the Medium pack by completing 30 puzzles. You can unlock the “Big” pack by finishing 60, and so on.
* If you get stuck, you can just skip a level. Each time you unlock a pack, all 60 levels in it are unlocked as well.
* Each puzzle is scored by how many moves you make and how fast you complete it. A perfect game will give you a star. Stars are not used for anything, but they make you feel good inside.
* Although the puzzles don’t change when you play them over, the replay value is surprisingly high. I found myself enjoying replaying the Warm-Up pack to try to beat my fastest time. I got down to two seconds on some levels.

* This game offers hours of mindless fun. The intensity comes in trying to beat your high score. It reminds me of trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube as fast as possible. The fun is not so much in solving the puzzle, but solving it at lightning speed.
* I have nothing bad to say about this game. It is entertaining and fun and offers hours of enjoyable and challenging gameplay.  If I had any complaint at all it would be that there is no hint option. There were some levels that I had to skip entirely because I just couldn’t figure them out.
* Flow Colors costs $0.99, which is just right for a game of this caliber. You get 360 different puzzles, each more challenging than the last. Plus, the Time Trial mode can be played over and over for even more exciting fun. There are free games like this in the App Store, but in Flow Colors, you won’t be asked to pay money to unlock any features.
* If you are a fan of puzzle games, I highly suggest checking this one out. It is full of fun and interesting challenges to keep your brain working hard while not taking up too much of your attention. The price is reasonable for a game in this genre. The design is iOS 7 friendly. It is a great game for puzzle lovers. This game is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Download it in the App Store today.
* Cube Flow Colors is very similar, as is Colors Flow. They both have the same basic premise, but include a few different features.
* We’ve got nine promo codes to giveaway. Have fun and tell us what you think of the game in the comments below.
