* Apple today noted in an updated support document that the viewing window for iTunes movie rentals in the United States has expanded from 24 hours to 48 hours.
* The change brings the US viewing window in line with the rest of the world where users have always had 48 hours to finish watching a rental after pressing play to start streaming.
* “You have 30 days to start watching a movie after you rent it,” reads the document. “After you start watching the movie, you have 48 hours to finish it.”
* You can watch your rented movie as often as you like until it expires. Like before, if you don’t start watching a movie within 30 days, you must rent it again.
* The 48-hour timer starts even if you’re offline. A rented movie automatically disappears from your devices when the rental period ends, whether you’ve watched it or not.
* Apple also noted in a separate document yesterday that free upgrades of iTunes movies to 4K (as well as new 4K purchases and rentals) only allows you to stream, not download.
