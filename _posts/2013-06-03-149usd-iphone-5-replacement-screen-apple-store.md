* A recent MarketWatch article has blamed high iPhone 5 repair costs on Apple’s tight control of the supply chain, which in turn dictates aftermarket prices.
* Perhaps responding to the criticism, the company has reportedly started selling a replacement screen component for the iPhone 5 for $149.
* Tipsters claim that the replacement display is offered in-store only, with or without AppleCare+.
* Although $149 is notably higher than the corresponding iPhone 4S screen assembly which costs about $95, Apple’s asking price undercuts the repair wizards over at iFixit who offer an iPhone 5 replacement screen for $200.
* And in response to Apple’s competitive pricing, some service shops are now starting to tweak their repair rates accordingly…
* MacRumors scooped the story:
* MacRumors heard from a tipster this morning that the new repair policy had been implemented and the changes have since been confirmed in a forum post from iPhone repair site Quick iFix.
* The repairs are available for cracked displays as well as screens that experience multitouch issues.
* We couldn’t corroborate the story at post time, but will update the article in case we learn anything new. Apple’s $149 screen replacement could be appealing to folks who smashed their iPhone’s screen and opted not to purchase the AppleCare+ protection plan.
* For those unaware, the AppleCare+ extended coverage costs $99 upfront and $49 for each of the two accidental damage issues covered by the warranty plan.
* It’s interesting how Quick iFix quickly discounted its own iPhone 5 display replacement from $174.99 down to $139.99 in order to remain competitive.
* The article goes on to speculate Apple could be switching to a subscription based AppleCare, where the plan would be tied to customers rather than individual devices.
* Coincidentally or not, iDB heard that Apple will be changing how device repairs are handled this summer.
* Specifically, a Brazilian Apple Authorized Service Provider reportedly received an email notice from Apple detailing the switch from replacing faulty devices with refurbished ones to performing repairs in-house, including the iPhone’s screen, camera, sleep/wake buttons and the logic board.
