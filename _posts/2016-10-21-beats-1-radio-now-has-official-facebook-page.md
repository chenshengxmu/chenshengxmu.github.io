* Apple has created the official Facebook page for Beats 1, its 24/7 radio station that broadcasts in more than a hundred countries via the Internet. The new Facebook page is in addition to the service’s presence on other social media channels, like Twitter. Before today, Beats 1 Radio posts were published through Apple Music’s own Facebook page.
* The page’s first posts promote DJ Zane Lowe’s “songs you can’t miss” and his candid interview with pop artist Lady Gaga who “gets real” about the Internet, family, fame, life-changing advice from Elton John and her latest album, “Joanne”.

* You can also message Beats 1 through its Facebook page.
* As 9to5Mac’s Benjamin Mayo noted, the page is not yet verified by Facebook but its legitimacy has been confirmed because the verified Apple Music account shared a post from the Beats 1 page.
* The page published its first post two days ago.
* Be sure to like the dedicated Facebook page for Beats 1 Radio. And while we’re at it, you may want to like iDownloadBlog’s Facebook page as well.
