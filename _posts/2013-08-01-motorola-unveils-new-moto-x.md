* As expected, Motorola unveiled its new Moto X handset today at an intimate event in New York City. Though Motorola has unveiled a few new devices since it was purchased by Google last year, this is said to be the first true product of their collaboration.
* Initial feedback on the phone has been positive. In line with previous leaks, the X has a 4.7-inch display, a number of customizable hardware options and some unique software features. But will it be enough to make a dent in the crowded smartphone market?

* Let’s start by looking at the hardware. The 4.7-inch display is of the 720p AMOLED variety, and it’s capable of some cool tricks. One of them is a feature called ‘Active Notifications ,’ which shows information at-a-glance without lighting up the whole screen.
* Motorola calls the X’s processor the ‘X8 Mobile Computing System,’ but it’s just a run-of-the-mill Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chip with two custom chips for the Moto X’s always-on voice recognition feature. It’s far from the most powerful setup available.
* To round out the specs, the Moto X has a 10-megapixel “Clear Pixel” RGBC camera, and 2GB of RAM. Everything else is customizable—you can choose between either 16GB or 32GB of storage, and casing color: chose from 2 front colors, 18 back, and 7 accents.
* As for the software, the phone runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and sports a few unique features. There’s ‘Touchless Control,’ which brings up the voice assistant anytime you say ‘Ok Google Now,’ and there’s Quick Capture, a motion-controlled camera launcher.

* I think it’s interesting that even though Google had a hand in creating the Moto X, it doesn’t come with the latest Android release (4.3) and it’s odd that there’s still some Motorola skinning. But I think the customizable aspect is cool, as are some of the features.
* Overall, though, I don’t know if this will be enough to keep Samsung or Apple up at night. But if you’re interested in picking one up, the Moto X is expected to be available at all US carriers later this month for $199—though AT&T has an exclusive on color options.
* So, what do you think about the Moto X?
