* Following its big iPad event yesterday, Apple seeded iOS 7.0.3 to the public. While there are no major new features in the update, it does include several fixes for issues like iMessage, inaccurate sensor data, and more.
* Initially, we warned folks who are hoping to jailbreak down the road to stay away from the new firmware until we were sure it was safe to update. Well late last night, MuscleNerd gave jailbreakers a digital thumbs up…
* From MuscleNerd’s Twitter account
* 7.0.3’s lock screen fixes won’t impact the JB (unless Apple’s holding back here, hah! http://t.co/wI7A4BHZk2 )

* And for even more clarification:
* @iphonesteven If you’ve already lost the JB by upgrading to 7.x, then yep it’s fine to go from 7.0.x to 7.0.3.

* So there you have it, folks. If you’re on any version of iOS 7 right now, updating to 7.0.3 won’t ruin your chances for jailbreaking in the future. Obviously, though, if you’re currently jailbroken on iOS 6.x, you should stay away.
* As far as the iOS 7 jailbreak goes, all we know right now is that the evad3rs are currently working on it. Earlier this month, planetbeing said that the team ‘may have all of the pieces in place,’ but we know little beyond that.
