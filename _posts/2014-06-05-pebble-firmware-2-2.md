* Pebble released a new firmware for its smartwatch line that enables two new features dealing with the App Menu and music playback controls, alongside a few other minor improvements.
* The new 2.2 firmware finally enables the volume control for music playback, something the company first demoed in the Pebble Music app months ago.
* In addition to music controls, the software makes it easy to rearrange the items in the Launcher Menu.
* The refreshed firmware is available through Pebble’s companion iPhone app, available free in the App Store and updated to the latest version last week…
* Check out the music volume controls in action.
* As for the App Menu organization, you just press and hold the device’s Select button while in the Launcher.
* The icons will start to wiggle, at which point you can move a menu item up and down the list as you see fit.
* There’s a Vine clip for that, too!
* Pebble firmware 2.2 changelog
* • The Launcher Menu is now re-orderable. Hold the Select button to re-position a menu item. • Volume control in the Music app. Hold the Select button while in the app to launch volume controls. • Music app redesigned: fixes layout issues and adds a track progress bar (progress bar is iOS only). • Alarm now vibrates for 10 minutes instead of 1 minute. • Bug fixes and stability improvements.
* Pebble last week bumped the iOS app to version 2.2 with support for iBeacon, the new firmware and more new JavaScript apps downloadable through the Pebble App Store.
* And with iBeacon now officially supported, the Pebble can detect when it’s in close proximity to an iOS device. This short-range sensing uses low-energy Bluetooth 4.0 networking so “impact on battery life is negligible.”
* The companion iPhone app is available free in the App Store.
* Simply fire up the app with the Pebble paired to your iPhone and it will detect the latest firmware and offer to update your smartwatch.
