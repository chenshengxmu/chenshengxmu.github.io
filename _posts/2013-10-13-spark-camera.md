* Spark Camera lets you record snippets of a moment in time, then record another moment at a later time, and stitches them together so that you can create your own mini montage video to share with friends and family…
* If you like taking lots of pictures and videos of important events and activities in your life, then you have probably wished you could splice together multiple videos into one so that you can share you life’s moments easier.
* You are in luck because Spark Camera features a clip maker for video recording. All you have to do is touch anywhere on the screen and hold your finger down until you are done capturing the moment. Then, let go of the screen. Repeat as necessary throughout an event, a day, or during your whole vacation.
* You can string together as many clips as you like for a maximum of 30 seconds of video footage. You could take 30 one-second clips or one 30-second clip. It’s up to you how you create your montage.

* You can delete the last clip recorded if you don’t like what you’ve captured and want to reshoot.
* The app records video at 720p. You will be able to share your creations on large screen devices. Mirror your iPhone to Apple TV to watch full screen HD quality montages.
* Tap “Play” to see what you’ve captured. Add a filter for visually stunning effects. To add a filter, just swipe to the left. Choose from a variety of filters, like Manhattan, Paris, and Barcelona. Pick the filter that fits the mood of your video.
* Tap the music note icon to add the soundtrack of your life. You can add any song from your iPhone music library.
* Once your video is complete, you can save it to your camera roll, or upload it to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. You can also email it or send it through iMessage. You can create as many videos at one time as you like. If you are creating a montage of your daily jogs, plus keeping track of your kitten’s playtime, you can have both videos in the creation queue at the same time.
