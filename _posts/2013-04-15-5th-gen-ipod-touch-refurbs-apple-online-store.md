* Apple regularly puts up slightly used products on sale after it refurbishes them. For example, last month saw the older iPod touches and certain iPad mini refurbs arrive.
* Today, the latest iPod touches popped up on the refurbished section of Apple’s online store. Discounts start at $30 for the entry-level 4th gen refurbs, going all the way up to $50 for 5th gen variants.
* These products are good as new, have only been used lightly, include a brand new battery and come with standard one-year AppleCare warranty. Interestingly enough, these refurbs have landed on the online Apple Store after Apple appears to have shut down its refurbished outlet on eBay…
* As pointed out by MacRumors, the special deals section on Apple’s online store is featuring these refurbs right now.

* The latest fifth-generation model with 32 gigabytes of storage is now available refurbished for $249 versus $299 for the factory-new counterpart. The pricier model with 64 gigabytes of storage is available for $349 refurbished – again, a $50 discount from its standard $399 price.
* The fourth-generation model that was updated last September also is now available refurbished, but only the basic model with sixteen gigabytes of storage: it costs $169 refurbished, a $30 discount from its regular $199 price.
* Apple released these iPod touches some six months ago, at a news conference in September 2012.
* On a final note, you may remember Apple, or some of its authorized resellers, in November 2012 stated offering officially certified refurbished products through eBay. That mini-store is gone now and the original link now leads to a FAQ rather than refurbished Apple offerings.
* The store notably undercut Apple’s own refurbs and, of course, one-upped the iPhone maker with PayPal payment options, which are standard on eBay.
