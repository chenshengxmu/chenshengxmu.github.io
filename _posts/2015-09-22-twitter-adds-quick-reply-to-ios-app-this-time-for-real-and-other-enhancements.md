* A Twitter update last week was supposed to make the mobile iPhone and iPad app play nice with iOS 9’s new text-based replies that are now available to third-party apps directly from notification banners, except it didn’t.
* Tuesday, the micro-blogging startup issued a new version of the iOS client which fixes last week’s botched update.
* Now iOS 9 users of Twitter’s mobile app can take advantage of full support for the Quick Reply feature from push notifications, the ability to access muted and blocked accounts in Settings and more.
* Before iOS 9, only Apple’s stock Messages app supported replying to messages directly from push alerts. Thanks to a new API in iOS 9, developers can at last embed a text entry field into their notifications, enabling Quick Reply functionality.
* Rather than launch the container app, Quick Reply in third-party apps functions much like in iOS’s stock Messages app. You just pull down on a notification banner to reveal the text field. Simply type your message into the field and press a Send button.
* Starting today, Twitter users on iOS 9 can expect the following when they update to version 6.37:
* Additionally:
* Twitter is available for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad with iOS 7.0 0r later. The 63.9-megabyte download offers an Apple Watch app and is localized in English, Arabic, Bokmål, Norwegian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish and Ukrainian.
* Grab Twitter at no charge in the App Store.
