title: iOS 4.3.1 Released in iTunes
---
* Apple has released iOS 4.3.1 for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. If you “Check for Updates” in iTunes, you will now have the option to download and install the latest version of iOS.

* iOS 4.3.1 fixes multiple bugs relating to graphics, enterprise authentication, and cellular connection glitches. Nothing that significant is contained in this latest build of iOS, and if you jailbreak, you’ll want to hold off from updating. 4.3.1 is a minor upgrade to iOS, and it is not currently available for the Verizon iPhone.

* To reiterate, if you upgrade to iOS 4.3.1, you will lose your jailbreak. Don’t feel like you’re missing out though; you’re better off waiting for a larger update (with a compatible jailbreak).
* Check out our Downloads section for direct links to iOS 4.3.1.
* Will you be updating to 4.3.1? Or are you waiting for an updated jailbreak solution? We most likely won’t see a jailbreak for 4.3.1. Hackers are probably holding off for the next major release of iOS.
