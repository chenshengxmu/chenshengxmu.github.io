* Rovio said last week it would launch its brand new puzzler Amazing Alex some time during this month. Today, the Finnish developer posted a new launch trailer and announced a release date: Amazing Alex will be landing on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad on Thursday, July 12 (alongside Tiny Wings 2).
* And if you’re still wondering about Angry Birds, you’ve hopefully checked out 30 new summer-themed water levels in Angry Birds Season and are keeping your fingers crossed for that Angry Birds pig game, due later this year…
* Amazing Alex is the result of Rovio’s recent IP acquisition of Casey’s Contraptions, a charming and addictive puzzle game by Snappy Touch and Mystery Coconut. The game challenges your gray matter with combining various objects and building contraptions to solve levels.
* Here’s the new launch trailer.
* More information is available at the Amazin Alex fan page on Facebook (maker sure to like the official iDB fan page, too).
* This brand new release could be only a tip of the iceberg proving there’s life past the incredibly successful Angry Birds (some think the franchise has run its course).
* Following the Angry Birds Space launch in March, Rovio dropped a hint in a blog post that “something even bigger” is coming, possibly alluding to a yet another brand new game. The company last month launched Angry Birds Heikki, a web-only game born out of its tie-up with Finnish Formula 1 racing driver Heikki Kovalainen.
* Rovio is also big on merchandising, licensing plush toys and other official Angry Birds merchandise and even planning to hit the silver screen with a possible animated series being mulled.
* I think I’ve had enough of Angry Birds so Amazing Alex will come as a much needed change.
* Do you plan on playing this game?
