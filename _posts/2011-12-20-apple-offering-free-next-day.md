* With Christmas now less than a week away, the deadline for shipments guaranteed to arrive before the holiday is drawing closer. That means that the folks hoping to avoid the last-minute retail crowds are running out of time.
* However, those still looking to snag an iPad or other Apple product for that special someone are in luck. The company has just upgraded its free shipping promotion from 2-3 day business day delivery to guaranteed next-day shipping.
* Ads regarding the new promotion have surfaced on Apple’s online store, stating that if you order qualifying products by December 21st (tomorrow), you are guaranteed delivery by Christmas Eve. So, which items qualify for free next-day shipping?
* iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches are all available for next-day air, but there are some restrictions. iPads and iPod touches are not eligible for engraving at this point. And sadly, Apple’s latest handset, the iPhone 4S, is not part of the promotion.
* Apple isn’t the only online retailer offering free shipping on iOS gear. MacMall, the popular Mac outlet shop, is offering free overnight shipping on tons of Apple products, and even has some nice discounts going. But you better act fast, there’s only a few days left!
