* Jailbreaking iOS 5.0.1 is about as easy as it can get on both Mac and Windows, but Windows users might encounter a couple of hiccups along the way if you’re not careful.
* The main thing to remember is that RedSn0w works best on Windows when you use XP Compatibility Mode and run it as an Administrator. By following those handy suggestions, the jailbreak process on Windows is just as easy as it is on the Mac.
* Check inside for a video tutorial that shows how to perform an iOS 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak on a Windows 7 machine…
* Step 1: Download RedSn0w from our downloads page and right click and select Properties > Compatibility > select Windows XP Compatibility mode, then click OK.
* Step 2: Right click on RedSn0w again and run as an Administrator.
* Step 3: Put your iDevice into DFU mode, and click Jailbreak.
* Step 4: Your device will now jailbreak, and afterwards you can run Cydia.
