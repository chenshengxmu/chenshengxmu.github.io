* Despite Tim Cook’s vow to “double down on secrecy,” we’ve seen a surprising amount of information regarding the next-generation iPhone in the past few weeks. We know its screen size, resolution, and even have a good idea of what it looks like.
* Or do we? Perhaps the amount of data floating around is actually a sign that we don’t know anything. Maybe everything we’ve seen to this point has been fake, or a misdirection. If so, this case manufacturer is about to throw away a ton of money…

* Mobile Fun Blog, a UK tech site, says that it has spoken to a case manufacturer that is so confident that the recent iPhone 5 speculation is accurate, that it’s already starting to produce cases based on the design.
* “One manufacturer we spoke to said that he was sure that the leaked images were accurate – so sure that he was already preparing to construct iPhone 5 cases and he’d be willing to ship replacements for free if they turned out not to be perfect.”
* Now, we shouldn’t have to remind you of the teardrop fiasco of 2011. A number of case manufacturers bit on those iPhone design “leaks” as well, and essentially ended up with tens of thousands of useless cases.
* That being said, we have seen far more evidence (and I use that term lightly) in favor of the above design, than against it. And considering that Apple was supposed to start “iPhone 5” production this month, that’s worth noting.
* It seems like the design of Apple’s next smartphone will either go down in history as one of the company’s best-kept secrets, or one of its worst.
* Which is it?
