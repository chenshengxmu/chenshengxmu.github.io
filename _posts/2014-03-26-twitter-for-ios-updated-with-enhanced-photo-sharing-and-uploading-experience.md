* Twitter has just updated its free iPhone and iPad client with unspecified “enhancements to sharing and uploading photos”. Behind the cryptically worded iTunes description is a slightly reworked interface for attaching a photo to a tweet, akin to Facebook’s Paper app. The update is now live in the App Store and I’ve included a detailed description along with a few screenshots depicting the feature in action…
* As depicted top of post, attaching an image to your tweet produces a split-screen interface, like before. The tweet compose sheet is in the upper half and your on-device photos are nicely laid out in a grid of thumbnails that sits in the lower half of the screen.
* The app by default shows your iOS Camera roll. To display images in a specific album, just pull down on the thumbnails slightly to reveal the new Albums button.
* And just like before, you can apply standard Avery effects after choosing an image, use the magic wand tool to automatically optimize for sharpness and vividness or crop/rotate the image.

* And this is what the tweeted out image looks like on my timeline.

* The iPad edition still uses iOS’s standard photo picker.
* As a reminder, you can set the quality for image uploads (Low, Medium, High) using the Image Quality option nested under the General section of Twitter’s settings.
* To disable image previews, flip the Image Previews button to OFF. This should come in handy to those concerned about bandwidth consumption when using Twitter on a cellular connection.
* Unfortunately, Twitter does not yet support various image thumbnail sizes in timelines like other iOS clients, namely Tapbots’ Tweetbot and Iconfactory’s Twitterrific.
* Download Twitter 6.3 for iPhone and iPad free in the App Store.
* The 16.3MB download requires iOS 6.0 or later.
