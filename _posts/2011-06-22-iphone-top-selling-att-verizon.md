* According to a recent study, after five months, the iPhone already dominates the Verizon network in the U.S. On AT&T, the numbers are even more impressive, with a 65% lead.
* BITG Research surveyed 250 Verizon and AT&T stores across the United States over a period of three months and determined that the iPhone is the number one smartphone on both carriers.

* “Of the Verizon stores surveyed, 51 percent said the iPhone was their top-seller and an additional 38 percent said it was tied for first with a rival Android device, typically the Samsung Droid Charge or the HTC Thunderbolt.
* At AT&T stores, the iPhone was even more dominant — 65 percent of them named it as their top selling phone. Another 31 percent said it was an Android device.”
* Overall, 58% of the interviewed stores said that the iPhone was their top-selling handset, and 20% said that it shared the top spot with a competing device.
* Combine this report with the fact that the iPhone is now more popular than Blackberry in the United States, and Apple has a very successful product on their hands.
* Keen in mind that, when comparing market share, it’s technically unfair to relate Android to the iPhone. Android is an OS, while the iPhone is hardware.
* If we’re going to compare Android and iOS market share, the numbers are a little different. Apple recently announced at WWDC that iOS accounts for 44% of the mobile market. And iOS also accounts for 64% of mobile browser usage.
* Do you think Android stands a chance against iOS?
