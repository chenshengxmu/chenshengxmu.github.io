* Apple on Monday seeded the long-expected iOS 11.4.1 update. Users of the iPhone and iPad can find the update using Apple’s over-the-air (OTA) mechanism. 
* Considered the 15th update to the iOS 11 operating system, iOS 11.4.1 comes more than a month after the launch of iOS 11.4. It contains mostly bug fixes and is likely to be the final iOS 11 version before iOS 12 launches this fall.
* Apple’s iOS 11.4.1 comes more than a month after the release of iOS 11.4, a significant update that introduced Messages in iCloud and AirPlay 2.
* To download iOS 11.4.1, go into your Settings app on your iOS device. From there, select General > Software Update.
* Also released today: HomePod 11.4.1, tvOS 11.4.1, and watch 4.3.2. These versions too only contain bug fixes and other minor updates.
