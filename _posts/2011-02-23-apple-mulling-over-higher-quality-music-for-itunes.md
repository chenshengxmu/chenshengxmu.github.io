* If you want fast food, you’re going to sacrifice on the quality of said meal; the same applies to music. Over the years the digital music revolution has indeed made digesting tons of good music easier, but it came at the expense of quality.
* Apple is looking to rectify some of the quality issues by potentially allowing the use and download of 24-bit audio files; the current industry standard is 16-bit audio.
* What does this mean for users like you and I? Does this mean we’ll end up paying more for our music? Check inside as we mull over the possibilities…
* For starters, lets talk about 16-bit audio versus 24-bit audio. It’s likely that your average person who listens to their iPod via Apple’s stock ear buds isn’t going to notice much if any improvement.
* For those of you who fall into the audiophile segment, you will no doubt appreciate the fuller, richer sound offered.
* It’s almost like asking your grandma to tell the difference between a .wav file and a 320kbps .mp3 file. Chances are she’s not going to know the difference, although you probably will.

* But the extra data comes at a cost, because it will come in at roughly 3+ times the size of your average 16-bit file. Hence, a 100mb album download all of the sudden turns into 300mb. See the issue here?
* While storage has reached the point where a few hundred megabytes isn’t going to raise too many eyebrows, the bandwidth required for the extra data could present it as a legitimate concern.
* And don’t think that Apple isn’t going to pass some of that cost over to you, the consumer. Likely they will have an option for a premium service of sorts where you can either pay extra per track, or front them a yearly fee similar to Amazon Prime.
* The question is, will the increased audio quality really be worth the inevitable rise in cost? For me, that’s a no, because if I cared about a particular album that much, I’d just buy it on vinyl instead.
* What about you?
