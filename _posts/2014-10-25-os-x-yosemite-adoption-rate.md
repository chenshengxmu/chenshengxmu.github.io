* Apple’s just-released OS X Yosemite is thus far seeing slightly better adoption rates than last year’s Mavericks launch. New stats from the research team at Chitika ad network show Yosemite was installed on approximately 12.8% of Macs in North America in the first week.
* Additionally, Chitika notes that OS X Yosemite accounted for more than 1% of all North American Web traffic from OS X users on launch day. That’s more than double the first-day adoption rates of Apple’s prior Mac OS updates, OS X Mavericks and OS X Mountain Lion.
* There are a few reasons that could explain this year’s uptick. For one, Apple announced last week that it sold 5.5 million Macs during Q4—a record quarter in a record year for Mac sales. And two, OS X Yosemite is a substantial update, which featured several public betas.
* For context, Chitika sampled tens of millions of US and Canadian Mac OS X-based online ad impressions running through the Chitika Ad Network to quantify the first week of OS X Yosemite adoption. The data was drawn from impressions catalogued between October 16 and 22.
* Apple released OS X Yosemite on Thursday, October 16, following its iPad and Mac press event. It’s a free update for existing Mac users, and brings about several improvements including a new user interface, new features like Continuity and text message forwarding, and more.
