* iOS 11.3 will likely release without support for the Messages in Cloud feature and AirPlay 2.
* That’s according to the leaked iOS 11.3 release notes discovered by French developer Pierre Blazquez and published Thursday by French outlet Mac4Ever (Google Translate). A cursory glance at the document does suggest that neither Messages in iCloud nor AirPlay 2 are part of the release.

* Both features were supposed to launch alongside iOS 11’s release last September but instead saw multiple delays, appearing then disappearing from various iOS 11 betas.
* AirPlay 2 is required for the promised ability to pair two HomePods for better sound. AirPlay 2 will also deliver multi-room audio and simultaneous multi-device audio control.
* Apple removed AirPlay 2 support from iOS 11.3 and tvOS 11.3 betas in February without explanation, only to bring them back in subsequent releases.
* With Messages in iCloud, your iPhone stores the complete Messages database in iCloud and downloads only the most recent messages to your device, helping improve performance, reduce on-device storage consumption and make iCloud backups faster and smaller.
* We know there’ll be an iOS 11.4 software update because Apple’s ClassKit webpage mentions that building apps that work with Schoolwork using the ClassKit API requires iOS 11.4.
* Apple has not released a point-four version of iOS since iOS 8.4 launched in June 2015 so perhaps there’s still time to release Messages in iCloud and AirPlay 2 in time for the summer.
* Thoughts?
