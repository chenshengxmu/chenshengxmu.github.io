* I just got my all new iMac with Retina 5K display last week and I’m still going through all the settings to have it behave the way I want. One thing I noticed is that every time it goes to sleep or the screen saver kicks in, my Mac will require me to enter my user password when I wake it up.
* What is a great security feature if you work in an office is somewhat of an annoyance to me, simply because I work from home and no one except my wife ever gets to touch my computer, making this password an extra step that I don’t need.
* In this post, I’ll show you how to stop OS X from asking for a password after waking up your Mac.
* Obviously, if security is important to you, you should avoid what I’m about to share. If you work in an office or if you have people around your computer, again, skip all that and maintain a high level of security on your machine.
* Step 1: Go to  > System Preferences…

* Step 2: Select Security & Privacy.
* Step 3: Click on the General tab.

* Step 4: Uncheck the option that says “Require password 5 minutes” after sleep or screen saver begins.” As an alternative, you can always increase that time, while still maintaining a certain level of security.
* Step 5: A pop up will ask “Are you sure you want to turn off screen lock?” Make sure you’re completely ok with this and select Turn Off Screen Lock.
* Once this is done, you won’t have to enter your password every time you wake your Mac after it went to sleep or after the screen saver was activated.
