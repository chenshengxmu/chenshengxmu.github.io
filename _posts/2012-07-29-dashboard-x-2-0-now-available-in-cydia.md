title: Dashboard X 2.0 now available in Cydia
---
* The major upgrade to Dashboard X that we previewed last week is now available in Cydia. Dashboard X 2.0 brings a whole slew of new features to the popular widget tool, including resizable widgets, and independent orientation for both landscape and portrait mode.
* Even better is the fact that Dashboard X 2.0 is a free upgrade for existing users, and $1.99 for new users. Head over to Cydiaâ€™s ModMyi repo to download it now, and be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments section.
