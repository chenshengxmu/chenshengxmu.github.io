* Just when you thought we were done with the antennagate, a new video from iLounge surfaced, showing that the Verizon iPhone is also affected by an antenna issue. When held in the prior “death grip” position, the Verizon iPhone loses substantial cellular signal, just like we previously saw with GSM iPhone 4.
* Additionally, the CDMA iPhone 4 seems to be affected by a loss of wifi signal when held snugly in landscape mode. Both issues seem to be taken care of with the use of a case…
* Is Apple going to have to give away free cases again to cover a PR nightmare? Only time will tell.
