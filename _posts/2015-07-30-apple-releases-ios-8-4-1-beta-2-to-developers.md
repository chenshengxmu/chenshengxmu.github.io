* A little over two weeks after the iOS 8.4.1 beta debuted, Apple has seeded the second iOS 8.4.1 beta to developers.
* The previous iOS 8.4.1 beta contained no release notes, but many speculated that the update would contain the usual bug fixes, and perhaps even a fix for the exploits used in the iOS 8.4 jailbreak.
* We’ll be sure to update you if there are any findings with regard to what the release contains. At this point, it’s still up in the air, but the minor release version indicates that it likely contains no new front-facing features.
* iOS 8.4.1 beta 2 is billed as build 12H318, and can be downloaded as an OTA update for those running the first iOS 8.4.1 beta, and likely via Apple’s Developer center once it’s been updated.
* What do you think iOS 8.4.1 contains? Do you think that the iOS 8.4 jailbreak is indeed a goner as some have speculated? At any rate, it’s probably a good idea to prepare for iOS 8.4.1 in advance.
* Sound off in the comments below.
