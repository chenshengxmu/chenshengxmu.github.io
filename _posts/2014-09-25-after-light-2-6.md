* Afterlight by Afterlight Collective, Inc, an urban iPhone photographer’s dream app, was refreshed Thursday for iOS 8, bringing its set of accessible editing tools and powerful filters to the stock Photos app, while enabling manual camera control and additional perks.
* Other new features in this release, which is available as a free update to those who’ve previously purchased the 99-cent iPhone and iPad app, include the ability to share your fusion filters with friends via email, as well as native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* To use Afterlight’s filters and editing tools such as crop, rotate and more without leaving the iOS Photos app, you must first enable the Afterlight extension.
* To do so, open Photos, tap any photo, choose Edit and then hit the “…” icon. Now tap More and turn Afterlight on.

* In addition to Afterlight, Taptaptap’s award-winning Camera+ and ProCamera by Cocologics today both received their iOS 8 focused updates with manual camera control and other new features.
* In case you’ve been wondering, Apple’s iOS 8 update has opened up manual camera controls so people who build photography software can implement those features.
* Here is what’s new in Afterlight 2.6:
* Former iDownloadBlog writer Andrew Kunesh reviewed Afterlight back in July and immediately noticed that the software offers good value for money.
* The app, he wrote, is packed to the gills with a huge library of filters and a ton of interesting editing features yet to be seen in other photography apps on iOS.
