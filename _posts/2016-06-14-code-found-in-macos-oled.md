* Some evidence has been discovered within the code of the initial macOS Sierra beta that suggests there may be some truth to the rumors that Apple is building a MacBook Pro with a built-in OLED touch bar and Touch ID support. As noted by French site Mac Generation, there are several mysterious ‘kHIDUsage_LED’ references in macOS, as well as mention of support for “biometric devices.”

* Of course none of this necessarily means that Apple is on the verge of releasing a new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar and Touch ID. But between these references, past reports and the leaked chassis, it certainly seems like the company has some interesting new hardware in the wings. Highly regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the new MacBook Pro will launch in Q4 of this year.
