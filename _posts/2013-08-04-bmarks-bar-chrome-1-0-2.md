* We raved about BMarks Bar – Chrome on the last episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak, and for good reason, as it’s one of the best Google Chrome tweaks yet to be released. Recently, the tweak was updated with all sorts of new goodies, which is sure to make the bookmarking experience even better with Google Chrome.
* Version 1.0.2 of BMarks Bar – Chrome brings enhanced iOS 5 compatibility, press and hold actions, dynamically updating bookmarks, and access to the bookmarks bar while in full screen mode. Needless to say, if you’re a fan of Google Chrome, you definitely want to check out the new features that this update brings to the table. Full video overview of the new features inside.
* My favorite new feature of version 1.0.2 of BMarks Bar is the new dynamically updating bookmarks. In the previous version of the tweak, you had to completely close out of Chrome in order for new bookmark settings to be pushed to Chrome’s bookmark bar. With version 1.0.2, you can literally sit and watch as the bookmarks bar updates whenever you make changes via the full desktop version of Chrome.
* The other feature that I really appreciate is the ability to view the bookmarks bar while in full screen mode. While the developer has labeled this as an experimental beta feature, I found no problems with it during my tenure with the update. I especially like the full screen bookmarks bar while perusing websites via landscape mode.
* If you’re already a user of BMarks Bar, then this free update is a no-brainer. If you’ve been sitting on the fence about this tweak, then get off the fence, because this update makes it even more of a must have tweak for Chrome users.
