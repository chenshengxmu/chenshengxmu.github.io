* The leading music-streaming startup Spotify on Thursday announced a better way to preview music using new gestures in its iOS app. Dubbed Touch Preview, the feature allows music lovers to get a sneak peek of any playlist, song, album or artist by holding down their finger to start the music playing instantly.
* “It means less time looking for the perfect music, and more time actually listening to it,” wrote the company.
* If you like a song you’re previewing using Touch Preview, you can quickly add it to your collection by left-swiping. Both Touch Preview and the new swipe gestures are available to iOS users from today, and will soon be rolled out across other platforms.
* Here’s Touch Preview in action.
* Spotify’s previous update brought native display support for the new iPhones and a handy music discovery feed called Top Tracks In Your Network, which gets automatically populated with the music the people you follow are listening to right now.
* Last Monday, the Swedish firm announced a major milestone: it now has fifteen million subscribers paying for its premium features and sixty million active users total.
* The 32.7-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Spotify free in the App Store.
