* According to the rumor mill, the iPad 3 is going to employ some pretty amazing features. We’ve heard it could contain everything from a high resolution Retina display, to a new processor, and a 5MP camera. There has even been talk of it having LTE.
* A lot of folks, however, have wondered how Apple would be able to maintain the tablet’s $499 entry price point with so many high-end components. Well according to some new evidence, it couldn’t…
* MacRumors points to an interesting post on a Weibo (like a Chinese Twitter) account that appears to offer some iPad 3 pricing details. As you can see in the chart above, someone thinks that Apple’s next tablet will be more expensive than previous models.
* We have to say that we’re fairly skeptical of the legitimacy of this pricing matrix. Bumping the price of its Wi-Fi iPad model $80 doesn’t seem like an Apple move. Especially considering that it has kept all of its iOS products at or under their original prices over the past 5 years.
* This isn’t the first unverified rumor we’ve seen surface on the Chinese micro blogging site. Over the weekend another poster published alleged evidence that iPad 3 shipments were already in route to the US.
* It’s certainly possible that Apple’s next tablet could receive a price bump due to its new features. But we don’t think it’s very likely. Well at least with the iPad 3 media event expected on March 7th, we don’t have to wait too much longer to find out.
* What do you think? Would you pay $80 more for a new iPad?
