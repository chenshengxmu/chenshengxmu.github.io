* The popular 3D Touch app switcher gesture that was intentionally removed from the initial release of iOS 11 has been brought back in iOS 11.1 beta 2.
* Apple seeded iOS 11 beta 2 to its registered developers earlier today.
* First implemented in iOS 9, the gesture lets you invoke the iOS app switcher by pressing the left edge of the screen with 3D Touch. All iPhones from iPhone 6s onward feature 3D Touch.

* If you press firmly on the left side of the screen, you jump straight to the iPhone multitasking switcher where you can force-quit apps by swiping them up, browse your recently used apps by swiping the thumbnails left or right or bring any app to the foreground by tapping it.
* The video embedded below shows the gesture in action.

* You can also press the left edge of the screen lightly then drag all the way to the right to cycle between two apps, letting you quickly switch back to the last app in one swipe.

* Apple’s Federighi explained they’ve had to temporarily drop support for the gesture “due to a technical constraint” while promising to bring it back via an upcoming iOS 11.x update.
* Are you happy that Apple is bringing the 3D Touch app switcher back?
