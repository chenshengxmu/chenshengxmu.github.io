* Yesterday, we brought you a preview of the upcoming quick reply and quick compose tweak, Couria. Today, we’re showing you how you can go hands on with the tweak.
* Couria is now available on a special beta repo by its developer, QusicS. If you’ve been desperate for a good quick compose solution and an enhanced quick reply interface, then you may want to take it for a test drive.
* First of all, be sure to watch our hands-on video above so that you know what to expect before you add the beta repo. As you’ll see, the tweak is still in development, but it’s fleshed out enough to where it’s usable.
* Step 1: Launch Cydia
* Step 2: Tap Sources → Edit → Add
* Step 3: Add the following repo address in the Enter Cydia/APT URL box
* http://cydia.qusic.me/
* Step 4: Tap Add Source
* Step 5: On the Source tab, tap Q’s Beta and find Couria under the Tweaks section
