* Apple today released the first beta of what would become the macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 software update. It’s available to Apple’s registered developers and Appleseed participants.
* This comes hot on the heals of the public releases of iOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1, tvOS 11.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 earlier this morning.
* The point update carries a build number of 17C60c.
* The macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 developer beta can be downloaded from Apple’s Dev Center or using the Software Update mechanism by clicking the Updates tab in Mac App Store on a machine with an appropriate configuration profile installed.
* We’re installing it now and will update with any changes we find.
* The previous macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 update contained bug fixes and some additional features like 70+ new emoji, improvements to Exchange sync in mail and Bluetooth issues during Apple Pay, plus a fix for the Spotlight input problem with external keyboards.
