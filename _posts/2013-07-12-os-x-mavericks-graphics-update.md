* Apple has released a new graphics update for OS X Mavericks. The update, which is aimed at users running OS X Developer Preview 3 is to resolve an issue where a Mac running OS X Mavericks Developer Preview 3 may reboot without warning. The graphics update, which is a 1.0 release, comes in at 4.9 megabytes and requires a restart after installation.
* If you’re running OS X Mavericks Developer Preview 3, then you can open the Mac App Store app and click the Updates tab in order to find the update. This update comes right on the heels of yesterday’s OS X Recovery update, and AirPort Utility fix. Let us know if you notice any differences in your Mac’s performance after installation.
