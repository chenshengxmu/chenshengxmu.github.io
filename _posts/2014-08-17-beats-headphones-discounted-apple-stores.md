* Apple’s short-term strategy regarding the $3 billion buy of Beats Electronics and Beats Music is starting to take shape with each passing day.
* Not only is it actively advertising and selling Beats products through its brick-and-mortar locations and online retail stores, but now the California firm has shaved a cool 10 percent off all Beats by Dr. Dre headphones and assorted accessories.
* This is virtually an unheard-of move — the company rarely discounts its own products by more than a meager few percents.
* I’d say that it’s kinda interesting seeing the maker of overpriced gadgets — as haters usually diss Apple — actually bring the overpriced Beats by Dr. Dre headphones to more bearable levels…
* As an example, the Beats by Dr. Dre Studio Over-Ear headphones that normally sell for $299.95 now retail for a more reasonable $269.95 over at the US Apple Store.
* Likewise, the $599.95 Studio x Snarkitecture headphones dropped to $539.95 while the $449.95 Beats Pro Over-Ear ones are now $404.95.
* The popular in-ear headphones have seen price drops, too. Case in point: the $199.95 Beats by Dr. Dre Powerbeats2 Wireless Headphones can now be had for $179.95.
* For those wondering, other Beats products like speakers and audio accessories are now 10 percent cheaper as well. Mark Gurman has learned through a source that the price cuts are temporary as the promotion will reportedly last through this coming Saturday, August 23.
* Interestingly, the $49.95 Beats Pill Dude speaker covers haven’t been discounted.

* Apple two weeks ago gave Beats by Dr. Dre products their own section on its webstore.
* Similarly, the Beats Music earned its spot in the ‘Apps Made by Apple’ section on the App Store. Moreover, the firm was recently seen pushing the subscription-based music streaming service to new iOS device owners via App Store prompts while attempting to bring new customers by making annual subscriptions more affordable.
