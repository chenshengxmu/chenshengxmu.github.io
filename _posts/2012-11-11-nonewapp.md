* Do you find yourself hating the “new” badge that appears on newly installed apps from the App Store? I must admit, that even if I have no intentions of using a newly downloaded app right away, I’ll at least open it once to rid it of that ugly badge.
* If you happen to jailbroken, there’s an even easier way to get rid of the eyesore, and it’s called NoNewApp. NoNewApp is a recently released jailbreak tweak that prevents the “new” badge from appearing on newly downloaded apps.
* Want to see how it works? Take a look inside for our full video walkthrough…
* As you can see, NoNewApp is a simple tweak with no settings or options for you to configure; just install it and go. If you want to give it a try for yourself, then head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo where it can be had free of charge.
* Remember, you’ll need to be on iOS 6 for this tweak to be of any use to you. That’s because the “new” app badges are a relatively new addition that first appeared with iOS 6.
* Be sure to let us know what you think about NoNewApp in the comment section below.
