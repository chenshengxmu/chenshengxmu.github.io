* A new report out of Taiwan this morning claims that Foxconn is going on a major hiring spree to help fill orders for Apple’s next generation iPhone, believed to be the iPhone 5S. Production on the handset is said to be ramping up ahead of its fall launch.
* Citing sources familiar with the matter, Taiwanese publication Focus Taiwan reports that Foxconn is starting to heavily recruit for its Shenzhen plant, and it’s looking to add as many as 90,000 people to its workforce as it begins to fulfill major 5S orders…
* Here’s the report:
* “Hon Hai Group, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has started recruiting new workers for its Shenzhen production complex, one of the sites where it assembles iPhones and iPads for Apple Inc., sources in the Apple supply chain said Saturday.
* The sources said Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract electronics maker, needs additional staff to deal with large orders from Apple for a new version of the iPhone.”
* This matches up with information passed along by China Business News earlier this month, which also claimed that Foxconn was looking for help building a new version of Apple’s smartphone. And considering how bad it messed up iPhone 5 production, it needs it.
* While Foxconn is said to be building the iPhone 5S, Apple is using Taiwan-based Pegatron to build its budget iPhone. It’s not known, though, if the switch is related to Foxconn’s performance, or if Apple is just looking to diversify. But it’s seemingly been confirmed.
* Both devices are expected to launch this fall. The budget iPhone, believed to be the ‘5C,’ is said to be made of plastic and will come in a variety of different colors. And as for the iPhone 5S, it should feature a number of upgrades, including a built-in fingerprint sensor.
