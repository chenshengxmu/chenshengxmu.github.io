* The iPhone Dev Team has been mighty busy as of late, updating their popular jailbreak tools with 5.1.1 Untether compatibly using the Rocky Racoon 5.1.1 Untether. The updates include PwnageTool 5.1.1, Redsn0w 0.9.12b1, cinject 0.5.4, and UltraSn0w 1.2.7.
* If you’ve already jailbroken your device, and everything is working fine, they suggest, as do we, that you stick with your current jailbreak. If, on the other hand, you’ve experienced problems with tools like Absinthe, then you may welcome the addition of these updated tools from the iPhone Dev Team. Keep in mind that the underlying jailbreak is the same across all tools; they all utilize the Rocky Racoon untether where appropriate; the only difference is the way the exploit is injected.
* Take a look inside for notes from the iPhone Dev Team, as well as download locations for the new tools.
* If you’re interested in downloading any of the new tools, simply head over to our downloads page where we have posted links to all of the latest jailbreak tools available. UltraSn0w is of course, available only on Cydia, and you can download it from one of the default Cydia repos available after you initially jailbreak your device.
* This tool can be used to jailbreak A4+earlier devices in one of two ways, and it also includes a new feature to inject the SAM unlock if you happened to get in on the SAM unlock while it was available.
* PwnageTool also avoids any possible sync issues, but again it applies only to A4+earlier devices. If you unlock your iPhone with ultrasn0w or a commercial method, you must use PwnageTool to avoid updating your baseband otherwise you’ll lose the unlock. PwnageTool will also jailbreak+untether the AppleTV2,1 5.0_2B206f (unless you customize the IPSW further, you’ll have just basic SSH access to the device).
* This the same as the previously available cinject 0.5.3 tool, which also included the Rocky Racoon untether. The Dev Team simply notes that this latest version includes some updates.
* Again, this can be used to unlock your iOS 5.1.1 device if you have a baseband that is eligible for unlock.
* We realize that all of this is a lot of information to digest at once, so we will be following up with walkthroughs and guides in the very near future. Remember, if you want to download any of the aforementioned tools with the exception of UltraSn0w, you can do so from our Downloads page.
* Are you happy to see RedSn0w finally gain Rocky Racoon support? What do you think about these latest updates?
