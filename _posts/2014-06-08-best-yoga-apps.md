* No more excuses. It’s time to get in shape both mentally and physically. One way to attack mind and body at once is through regular yoga sessions. If you think you are too tough for the balancing exercise, think again. Yoga has been known to kick the butts of even the strongest athletes.
* You know you want to try it, even if it is in the privacy of your own home, so we’ve compiled a list of apps to help you get started.

* Whether you are training to be a yoga teacher, or are already a professional yogi, this app is great for helping you create your own practice routine. Choose from 175 poses with variations and transitions. Customize the duration of each pose. Add your own playlist. You can also share your routine with others to get feedback. This app is available for $9.99.

* The same company that brought you the Practice Builder above also has a slightly less customizable version for those looking to be trained instead of those looking to train. It features 200 pose illustrations, voice guided instructions and breathing techniques. You can read up on descriptions and benefits of poses and keep a log of your progress. This app is available for $2.99.

* Just like the two above, this app is like a yoga class in your pocket. You’ll have access to more than 300 poses and breathing exercises. Watch HD quality video demonstrations for each with 3D muscle simulations for every pose. Practice as a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or guru. There are 45 predefined programs or you can create your own. This app is available for $3.99.

* Maybe you don’t have time to make it to your local evening yoga class. Maybe you are a little embarrassed to leave the house in those skin-tight leggings. If you would rather practice at home, this app is like a professional yoga class in your living room. It features 30 unique classes that range in length between 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Beginners, intermediates, and advanced students will be right at home with this easy-to-follow customizable app. This app is available for $3.99.

* Practicing your yoga poses is great and all, but losing weight, gaining muscle, and achieving an overall better body takes more than just standing in awkward positions for 30 minutes per day. This app features a subscription-based program to help you learn everything you need to get your body in shape. In addition to the wide variety of focused sessions, you’ll be learning customized routines from professional yoga instructors. With 40 sessions and 300 poses, you’ll be on the way to the perfect body in no time. This app is available for free.

* The app’s description says it all. Everything you know about stretching is wrong. This app teaches you how to perform a series of motion-based stretches instead of static ones. Once you’ve properly started the blood flow, you can switch to one of your yoga apps for a more beneficial session. You’ll learn stretches for sports, rehab, and more. This app is available for $2.99.

* Find your center wherever you are with YogaGlo’s classes. Practice in the comfort of your home and when you travel with yoga classes in HD and standard resolution that can be taken online or offline. The well-designed app is free to download, but you’ll have to pony up $17.99/month to access the 3,000+ classes and other features. This app is available for free.
