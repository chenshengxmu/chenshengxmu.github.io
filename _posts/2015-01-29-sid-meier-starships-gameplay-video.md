* Earlier this month, publisher 2K Games and developer Firaxis announced that Sid Meier’s Starships, a brand new tactical strategy game in the Beyond Earth universe, will be coming to the Mac, iPad and Windows platforms this Spring.
* And now, the first ever gameplay footage of Starships went live on YouTube, with Sid Meier himself demoing the game as part of the Firaxis Games Megapanel at PAX South.
* The whole presentation runs 49 minutes and 23 seconds long, but I’ve set it to start at the live gameplay segment at mark 29:57.
* Based on the proven turn-based 4X combat formula, Starships combines diplomacy, explorations and strategy space combat into one sweet package.
* Here’s the original announcement trailer.
* Some of the headline features of the game include dynamically generated combat missions, customizable starships, a number of exciting technologies to research and explore (like other Civilization games) and much more.

* Starships puts heavy emphasis on building a planetary federation to defend planets against various enemies and offers cross-connectivity with Civilization: Beyond Earth.
* It’s shaping up to be one heck of a strategy game for the Mac and iPad so keepyour eyes peeled as we dig up more information ahead of the official Spring 2015 release.
