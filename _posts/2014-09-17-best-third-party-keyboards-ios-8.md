* With the launch of iOS 8 finally arriving, developers are updating their apps and introducing new ones that take advantage of the many new features. Several keyboards that have been around for a while, as well as some new ones, can now replace your default iOS keyboard forever.
* Below is a comprehensive list of the keyboard apps that are available for users to download and install on iOS 8 right now. We’ll be updating the index as more releases come to our attention, so be sure to check back soon. If you are aware of an app that we haven’t featured below, email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a comment below with a link to the app!
* This post will be updated as more custom keyboards become available in the App Store.
