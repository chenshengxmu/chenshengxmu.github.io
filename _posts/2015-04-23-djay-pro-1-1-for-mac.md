* In addition to transforming the Apple Watch into the world’s first wearable DJ controller with djay for Apple Watch, German developer Algoriddim also refreshed its Mac app this morning.
* Djay Pro 1.1 for Mac, the company’s flagship product, includes major new features such as real-time video mixing, native support for Pioneer’s CDJ and XDJ line-up of professional digital decks used by the likes of David Guetta, high-quality Spotify streaming with up to 320 kbps and a host of other advanced features and capabilities.
* Support for the Pioneer CDJ-2000nexus, CDJ-900nexus and XDJ-1000 decks isn’t half-baked, Algoriddim’s co-founder and CEO Karim Morsy told me over a Skype chat. In had, they worked extensively with Pioneer on bringing native, rock solid CDJ/XDJ controls to the Mac app.
