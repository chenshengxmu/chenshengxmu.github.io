* There had been rumors within the past few weeks that Best Buy would carry the Verizon iPhone 4 on its launch on February 10, but up until now, these were just wild speculations.

* The 2 iPhone models will sell for the same price as AT&T’s iPhone: $199 for the 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB model. Below is the full press release from Best Buy…
* Best Buy today announced that the iPhone 4 from Apple on the Verizon Wireless network will be available in Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile specialty stores across the country beginning Feb. 10, the first day the device is available to the public.
* “The iPhone 4 is an important device for Best Buy and we are excited to help Apple and Verizon Wireless bring it to even more consumers,” said Shawn Score, president of Best Buy Mobile. “Our customers have come to expect Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile stores to carry the best selection of mobile phones anywhere, and offering the iPhone 4 on Verizon’s network is our latest effort to deliver on that promise.”
* The iPhone 4 on Verizon Wireless retails for $199 for 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB model with a new or qualified upgrade with two-year agreement.
