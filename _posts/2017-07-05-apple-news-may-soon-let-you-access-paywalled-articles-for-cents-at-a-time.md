* A new AdAge report Wednesday asserts Apple could soon enable a brand new micropayment option inside its News app to let readers access articles locked behind a paywall, like those from The Wall Street Journal, “for cents at a time”.
* Citing people familiar with the plans, the publication has learned that the Cupertino giant is also coming up with new ways for major publisher partners to sell advertising on their articles encoded in the native Apple News format.
* Apple may permit publishers to inject ads in the News app directly from third-party ad networks such as Google’s DoubleClick for Publishers. It should help Apple News become more of an extension of the publishers’ own websites than the walled-off island it is now.
* “There’s a ton of scale there but no dollars,” a publishing partner told the publication. “So Apple has to do something soon or publishers will pull out.” The iPhone maker should open new money-making avenues for publishers when iOS 11 launches for public consumption this fall.
* Publishers aren’t making much money on Apple News because Apple maintains tight control over ad delivery in the News app, which claims a comScore-estimated 47 million monthly users.
* iOS 11’s News app brings personalized top stories and suggestions from Siri, daily curated stories via a new Spotlight tab and the best videos of the day in your Today view.
* Does it make more sense for Apple to allow standard ad serving on Apple News?
* Tell is in comments!
