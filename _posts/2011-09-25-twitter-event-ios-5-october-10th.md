* Twitter has coincidentally scheduled a pair of “Developer Teatimes” for October 10th and October 12th. The meetings will focus heavily on Twitter’s integration with iOS 5 — a feature that was announced by Apple at WWDC this past Summer.
* Apple has also told its AppleCare division to expect a high influx of iOS 5-related questions on October 10th. Employee vacation blackouts have also been put in place for the 2nd week of October. Do we finally have our iOS 5 release date?
* Twitter’s message to developers:
* “There’s a lot going on in the ecosystem and we’d like to take this chance to share the highlights with you – including the latest developments with the platform, areas of opportunity that we’re seeing, and a heavy focus on the iOS 5 Twitter integration for developers.”
* It’s unlikely for Twitter to hold a public event for iOS 5 until the software is made available to the public, so this news all but confirms the iOS 5 public release by October 10th.
* The final iOS 5 GM build was expected to be released to developers this past Friday, but Apple has yet to release the firmware. Apple media invites and the iOS 5 GM are expected to drop during this upcoming week.
* iOS 5’s integration with Twitter was demoed months ago to developers. The integration allows users to tweet from certain iOS apps and share pictures via the popular social network.
* Apple is expected to announce next generation iPhone hardware alongside iOS 5 and iCloud to the public on October 4th. Following the announcement, iOS 5 should be made available to the public by October 10th, with new iPhone hardware hitting the shelves by October 13th/14th.
