* Good news for those of you still experiencing issues with the TaiG jailbreak for iOS 8.3: a new update for the tool has been released to fix several problems that are still plaguing users.
* TaiG 2.1.3 has been released to address some major concerns with the tool, and although it remains a Windows-only app, the update brings changes to the way it responds when used with a virtual machine on Mac and Linux systems. Check out the full change log for all of the details.
* Here is the full change log for TaiG 2.1.3:
* I know for a fact that, despite our best efforts to help users solve these issues, some were unable to overcome them. For those of you hit fit into this group, you should download TaiG 2.1.3 from our downloads (mirror thx r/jailbreak) page right now and attempt the jailbreak.
* I recommend that only those who remain unjailbroken use this tool. The issue with the disappearing icons has already been addressed yesterday by a Cydia package, and I imagine that this update will appear on the default Cydia repos to update the Untether package to 2.1.3 to address all other concerns. In fact, if you really want the update and don’t want to wait for it to appear on Cydia proper, you can simply add http://apt.taig.com to your Cydia sources, and you’ll find the 2.1.3 update there.
* Have you tried version 2.1.3 yet?
