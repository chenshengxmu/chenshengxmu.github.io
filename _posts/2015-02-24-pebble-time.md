* As expected, Pebble Technology on Tuesday took the wraps off its next-generation smartwatch. It’s called Pebble Time and the biggest news about it is its brand new e-paper color screen, a stark change from the monochromatic e-paper screen of the original Pebble.
* The device is also thinner than the previous models, has an on-board microphone, runs a redesigned Timeline interface while offering a few other goodies.
* Design-wise, the new Pebble is 20 percent thinner than the previous model at just 9.5mm, is water resistant, can use any standard 22mm watch band, has silent vibrating alarms and features tactile buttons for eyes-free clicking.
* The lens is crafted from scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass with a bezel made of stainless steel. There’s also a smart accessory port for hardware developers to build sensors and smart straps that connect directly to the watch, but the company wouldn’t say more.
* On the software side, you’ll notice the new app menu with app faces that support glanceable content. The notifications system has seen some rather interesting changes as well.
* “You already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle,” boasted the firm, describing the redesigned interface.

* “Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps.” To access notifications, just click the middle button on the right side.

* To scroll back in time to see notifications you missed, press another button. Your upcoming appointments, calendar entries and other events are accessible via a third button.
* Built-in microphone lets you respond to notifications, send voice replies, take short voice notes and more. Voice replies for iOS users are currently limited to Gmail notifications though Pebble says it’s working to enable the feature for more apps.

* On Android, sending voice replies works with most major apps including SMS, Hangouts, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp “and hundreds more.”
* Pebble Time features an efficient battery that the company claims lasts seven days on a single charge — again, like the previous model and despite its always-on color display with a great backlight.
* The redesigned Timeline interface “highlights what’s important in your day” and now allows information to be pushed into it from the web, no apps required whatsoever. Speaking of apps, the device is fully compatible with all 6,500+ existing Pebble apps and watch faces.

* The new Timeline will also work with the Pebble and Pebble Steel.
* The device works with iOS 8 and is compatible with any iPhone from the iPhone 4s onward. On the Android side, the Pebble Time supports Android 4.0+ phones from the likes of Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more.
* Backers of the original Pebble will be treated to an extra special engraving. The watch is available in three color flavors:
* The device will retail for $199 and is currently available over at Kickstarter, with early bird pricing tiers at $159 and $179.
* Here’s the complete list of reward tiers:
* The device will be shipping around the world, but deliveries are not set in stone as each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month and Pebble cautions that it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift.
