* Mac users with a preference for streaming their favorite music tracks via Spotify instead of Apple Music are going to love an extension for macOS dubbed SpotMenu.
* Written entirely from Swift, this app is a combination of two older apps known as Trayplay and Statusfy. It brings a Now Playing-like interface made specifically for Spotify to the Menu Bar on your Mac so that you can interact with your music more easily.
* Once installed, a new icon appears in your Menu Bar that looks an a lot like the Spotify app icon:

* When you start to play any music in Spotify, you can click the Menu Bar icon to interact with what’s playing:

* Having the artist and song name appear in the Menu Bar is optional, but I think it’s a nice touch because it lets me see what’s playing without having to open the app.
* Hovering your mouse pointer over the album artwork in the pop-up interface displays hidden controls for pausing or playing the song. Forward and back navigation buttons are also available on both sides of the album artwork so you can move through your playlist in sequential order:

* Because there are some optional aspects to SpotMenu, a preferences pane exists where you can tinker with the app. You can access it by right-clicking on the Menu bar icon and choosing Preferences…:

* In the Preferences pane, you can personalize how the app looks and behaves while in your Menu Bar:

* Among the things you can configure are:
* In my example, you can see the options I’ve chosen to enable. In my opinion, displaying the music symbol feels a little bit redundant, so I’ve left that disabled, but I do like seeing the artist and song information because that eliminates the guessing factor when I hear something I like and want to know what it is.
* There’s not much to SpotMenu, but it’s still a great complementary app for Spotify listeners who use macOS as their operating system of choice. After having tried it myself, I now think using Spotify without SpotMenu feels barren and incomplete.
* If you’re interested in trying SpotMenu, the app is a free download from the developer’s GitHub page. To install it on your Mac, may have to allow apps from unidentified developers,. You can do this at your own discretion from System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from. You will have to enter your password to enable apps from unidentified developers.
* Do you agree that SpotMenu is a great addition to the Spotify experience on macOS? Share why or why not in the comments section below!
