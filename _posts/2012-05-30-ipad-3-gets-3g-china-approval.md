* Looks like Apple could finally launch its iPad 3 in the huge market of China as their regulatory agency just approved a mysterious 3G device. Though the filing doesn’t name it, it’s clear from a model number that a network certificate has been issued for the new iPad…
* Paul Mozur, writing for The Wall Street Journal, explains:
* Chinese regulators have approved an Apple Inc. device with high-speed wireless-data capabilities, suggesting that the U.S. computer maker is one step closer to selling the latest version of its iPad in China.
* According to the website of China’s Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center, an Apple device with third-generation, or 3G, data capabilities has been issued the license needed for the company to begin sales in China.
* This unnamed device is listed under model number A1430 which denotes the new iPad. The device has been certified for use on the China Unicom network, Apple’s carrier partner for the iPhone as well.
* A spokeswoman for the carrier declined to comment on the story.
* If true, this is good news for Apple as the new iPad’s certainly been long overdue in the 1.33 billion people market.
* Hopefully, this also means that some sort of resolution to a legal fight with Proview over the iPad moniker is coming to a close.
