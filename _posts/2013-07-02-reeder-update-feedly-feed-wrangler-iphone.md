* Silvio Rizzi’s RSS client for the Apple platform, Reeder, has built quite a loyal following. It’s one of the first full-featured RSS readers on the iPhone which won me over with its elegant and sophisticated user interface, clever use of gestures and the ability to efficiently manage hundreds of feeds without crawling to a halt.
* Silvio has been diligently updating the software with new features and today he pushed a new version which enables two popular Google Reader replacement services just as Google’s web-based RSS client went offline yesterday…
* A client for Fever, Readability and RSS, the new Reeder version 3.2 brings support for Feedly and Feed Wrangler to the iPhone.
* Due to yesterday’s Google Reader shutdown, Silvio pulled Google Reader from the service list, though Reeder won’t delete existing accounts in the app.
* The app also features improved syncing with Feedbin. If you prefer Feed Wrangler over Feedly, you should be aware Reeder doesn’t support Feed Wrangler’s Smart Streams yet. Those who can’t live without Smart Streams can always turn to Feed Wrangler’s iPhone app.

* You can grab the update free from the App Store.
* And if you grabbing the app in the past, Reeder for iPhone has gone free last week so there really is no reason now not put this little gem on your Home screen.
* Unfortunately, Silvio has fallen behind the schedule in updating the OS X and Mac editions of Reeder. For what it’s worth, he explained in a blog post the reason OS X and Mac apps are taking longer than expected is because “it’s not that easy to add other services to the current versions of these apps”.
* @schwa It’s not that I don’t want to update these apps, I’m just not ready yet.

* Both iPad and Mac builds have been removed from iTunes as they only work with Google Reader.
* Here’s to the hoping fresh builds with Google Reader replacements surface sooner than later because my workflow depends on having Reeder on all my desktop and portable devices.
