* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in today’s research note that Apple may adopt a combination of fingerprint and face detection sensors to supplant Touch ID.
* In another note to clients obtained by MacRumors, Kuo claims that iPhone 8 will debut an enhanced form of 3D Touch technology with higher sensitivity and a wider range of pressure levels.
* As you know, iPhone 8 is expected to switch from the traditional LCD IPS panel to a flexible OLED screen curved at the edges. The problem is, flexible screens can be depressed and as such don’t play nice with Apple’s implementation of 3D Touch which requires a flat array of 96 sensors positioned between the cover glass and the display.
* Thankfully, Apple’s negotiating power comes to the rescue.
* According to Kuo, Apple’s OLED suppliers have agreed to create bespoke display designs for iPhone 8’s 3D Touch system, reinforcing it with a metal part to provide better structural support for a flexible OLED display.
* Here’s an excerpt from the analyst’s note:
* Apple may switch to a film sensor from the current FPCB 9 (Flexible Printed Circuit Board) sensor in order to provide better 3D Touch user experience, as a film sensor offers higher sensitivity. Also, we expect the new OLED iPhone will come with a flexible OLED panel.
* To avoid deforming the form factor of the flexible OLED panel from touch operation pressure, a metal structural part will be placed under the film sensor to provide more robust structural support.
* Kuo also contends that Apple is working on an optical fingerprint sensor for iPhone 8 that may augment or supplant the Touch ID capacitive sensor for biometric verification.
* Apple may eventually replace fingerprint scanning with full-face recognition for authentication and unlock. On the flip side, technical and manufacturing challenges could hinder Apple’s plan for a new form of biometric verification.
* Aside from iPhone 8’s all-glass design based on a flexible OLED display with a nearly zero-bezel look, Apple should also release this year iterative updates to the current iPhone 7 series in the form of LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.
