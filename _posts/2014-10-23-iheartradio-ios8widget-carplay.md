* Thursday, an enhanced version 5.3 of iHeartRadio became available for download in the App Store.
* The refreshed application brings out a nice Today widget allowing you to play your recent stations from the Notification Center in iOS 8. You should also appreciate its built-in support for Apple’s in-car entertainment system dubbed CarPlay, so you can now listen to iHeart Radio in CarPlay-enabled vehicles.
* The updated app can be grabbed for free in the App Store.
* Eagled-eyed readers could point out that iHeartRadio is among a handful of third-party solutions that provide music-streaming capabilities to Apple’s CarPlay.

* As stated on the official CarPlay webpage, the system currently supports audio and music streaming via Apple’s own Podcasts, Beats Music and iTunes Radio apps, in addition to third-party ones from the likes of Spotify, iHeartRadio, CBS Radio News, Stitcher, At Bat and Rdio.
* Both Rdio and Spotify recently refreshed their respective iOS apps with CarPlay support.
* iHeartRadio 5.3 changelog:
* The Internet radio app is available free in the App Store.
* The 25.9-megabyte download requires an iPhone or iPod touch powered by iOS 7.0 or later. Of course, the Today widget requires an iOS 8 device. Sadly, developers haven’t gotten around creating native iPad interface just yet, which is a shame.
* [App Store]
