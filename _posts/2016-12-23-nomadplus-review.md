* For everyday charging of your iPhone, the supplied power adapter that comes in your Apple retail packaging will suffice, but if you go places a lot, then having an AC adapter that can not only charge your iPhone, but also store power for charging when away from the plug is a must.
* Nomad comes the rescue in this department with an ingenious idea; a special type of AC adapter known as the NomadPlus that includes a built-in 1,800 mAh battery inside.
* Forget backup batteries; if you charge your iPhone every night, then you will have more than enough juice with a full charge and the NomadPlus to get you through even a day of heavy iPhone usage.
* The NomadPlus is designed in such a way that you can still use your OEM Apple power adapter to charge your iPhone or iPad from any power outlet, so you don’t have to worry about the dangers of third-party AC adapters ruining your device’s battery.

* The Apple power adapter fits very snugly into the NomadPlus. It can only go in one way, as the USB port in the AC adapter must plug into the NomadPlus. Once in, it won’t fall out, and requires a firm grip to pull back out again.

* The added 1,800 mAh battery capacity inside the NomadPlus lets you get a good charge even when you’re not near a power outlet. Depending on the model of iPhone you have, it can get you from near-dead to somewhere in the 90% range, or it could get you from half-capacity to fully charged.
* When you plug the NomadPlus into the power outlet, it gives priority to charging your iOS device, ensuring it charges as quickly as possible. As it charges your device, and even after, the power outlet will fill the internal battery of the NomadPlus with reserve power you can use later on.

* A power indicator is displayed on the front of NomadPlus, with each section of the circle representing 33% of charge. The incremental scale is as follows:
* Notably, even the USB port illuminates when the NomadPlus is plugged into the wall, so if you’re using it in the dark, you will be able to find the port with ease.
* The NomadPlus’s internal battery isn’t huge, but it’s just enough to give you a decent power boost throughout the day. This is something you can easily bring with you in your commute to or from work, as it’s not entirely huge by any means.
* Because the internal battery isn’t as high as a number of power banks on the market today, it doesn’t make a replacement for a heavy-duty battery pack. That said, you get a power boost from one full charge of the NomadPlus, but you can’t charge your iPhone or iPad repeatedly from the limited 1,800 mAh battery capacity.
* Still, to have a product that integrates right into something you use every single day, it offers a lot of convenience by providing you with spare power when you need it, such as when you’re stuck on the bus on your way home from work with only 10% of your iPhone’s battery remaining.
