* Fans of racing games, listen up! The official mobile game of the FIA World Rally Championship has been released in the App Store.
* Developed by Firebrand Games and published by Bigben Interactive, WRC The Official Game for the iPhone and iPad includes official content of the 2014 FIA World Rally Championship, including eighteen licensed cars, and lets you play as any of the seventeen official drivers to win a total of thirteen official events of the 2014 WRC calendar.
* While previous official titles have been something of a disappointment, WRC The Official Game looks promising, at least graphics-wise, so here’s hoping it doesn’t ruin the fun with inaccurate and unresponsive controls.
* Check out the promotional video below.
* Detailed graphics remind me of the Colin McRae Rally series, especially simulated weather conditions, real-time realistic damage and various surfaces.

* Should you find the included touch/motion controls lacking, the game packs in support for MFi game controllers that provide greater driving precision and accuracy.
