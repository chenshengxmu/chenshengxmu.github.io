* Disney this week launched a new keyboard app for iOS called “Disney Gif.” As the name suggests, the app allows you to browse through, and quickly share from, a library of animated GIF images and emoji icons featuring Disney content.
* For its launch, the keyboard features hundreds of images pulled from Disney’s expansive TV and movie collection, including Star Wars, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast, Inside Out, The Lion King and various hit television shows from ABC.
* The GIFs are categorized by emotion and story, so you can track down images by movie, or based on the mood you want to convey. Disney says new and trending content will be added frequently—some free and some via in-app purchases.

* For those who haven’t installed a custom iOS keyboard before, it’s fairly simple. After downloading the app, you’ll launch Settings and navigate to > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard. You will have to allow Disney “full access.”
* There are already a number of GIF keyboard apps available in the App Store, but I think there’s still room for one with properly curated, licensed Disney content. If you want to check it out, you can find Disney Gif in the App Store for free.
