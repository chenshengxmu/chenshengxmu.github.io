* It would seem that Apple gave select YouTubers permission to post early impression videos of iPhone X ahead of its scheduled launch this coming Friday, November 3.
* For instance, YouTube channel Booredatwork has published a nice little video walkthrough showing off the Face ID setup process on an iPhone X, which requires you to rotate your head in a circle during the enrollment process to complete a scan.
* Here it is in action.
* “Very simple, very straightforward,” notes the video.
* From there, you can simply glance at the Lock screen to unlock the phone and show all your notifications or, with a simple upward swipe, get to the Home screen. Unlike Touch ID that lets you enroll up to five fingers, Face ID only allows one registered face.
* How do you like Face ID so far?
* Let us know in the comments.
