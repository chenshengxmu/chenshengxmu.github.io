* If you’re a developer, then you might be interested in jailbreaking the latest beta version of iOS — iOS 6.1 beta 2. The beta was just released today, and like we always do, we’ve created a video tutorial that shows how to successfully jailbreak it if you happen to be a developer.
* Take a look inside as we walk you through the iOS 6.1 beta 2 jailbreak process step-by-step.
* Note: This is a tethered jailbreak for developers only. This jailbreak is only compatible with pre-A5 devices like the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod touch 4th generation.
* Step 1: Download and install iOS 6.1 beta 2. If you are a developer, then you will already know how to do this. If not, then you will have to wait until iOS 6.1 is released publicly.
* Step 2: Download RedSn0w 0.9.15b3 from our downloads page.
* Step 3: Ensure you have iOS 6.0 available for your device on your computer, if not, download the iOS 6.0 firmware file for your specific device via our downloads page.
* Step 4: Connect your iOS device to your computer, and place your iOS device into DFU mode.
* Step 5: Open RedSn0w and ensure it recognizes your device at the bottom of the screen as being in DFU mode.
* Step 6: Click Extras > Select IPSW > and point to the iOS 6.0 firmware file that we discussed in Step 3. It should successfully identify your firmware file. See the video for more details.
* Step 7: Go back to the main page of RedSn0w, and click Jailbreak. The jailbreak will process and then it will present you with an options screen.
* Step 8: Ensure that “Install Cydia” is checked, and click Next to proceed with the jailbreak process.
* Step 9: Once the jailbreak is complete, you should be on your Lock Screen.
* Step 10: Place your iOS device back into DFU mode.
* Step 11: Go back to the Extras > Select IPSW > and reselect the iOS 6.0 firmware file again. You must select this firmware file again on beta jailbreaks, or else you will get a failure message.
* Step 12: On the Extras page click Just boot to perform a tethered boot.
* Step 13: You should see a pineapple logo on your device’s screen after a while, as the device boots up.
* Step 14: Once the device is booted, swipe to the Home screen’s second page, and wait until the Cydia app icon appears on the page.
* Step 15: Congratulations, your iOS 6.1 beta 2 device is now jailbroken using RedSn0w 0.9.15b3.
* Again, keep in mind that this is a tethered jailbreak only, and that it only works with a handful of devices at the moment. If you’re interested in learning more about the jailbreak process, then please visit our dedicated jailbreak page, which explains everything.
* If you’re more interested in learning the inner workings of RedSn0w, then we’ve also created a dedicated RedSn0w page that covers nearly all of the available features of this wonderful app. This tutorial was created on a Mac, but the same exact principal applies to PC users. you should be able to use the exact same tutorial in order to jailbreak iOS 6.1 beta 2 on your PC using the latest version of RedSn0w.
