* With less than 24 hours until Apple Watch pre-orders begin, the Cupertino firm has issued a media release advising customers to reserve their unit online because “we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch”.
* Moreover, the company will be now taking orders for the device exclusively online “during the initial launch period.”
* Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s SVP of Retail and Online Stores, said this in the press release (emphasis mine):
* We are excited to welcome customers tomorrow and introduce them to Apple Watch, our most personal device yet. Based on the tremendous interest from people visiting our stores, as well as the number of customers who have gone to the Apple Online Store to mark their favorite Apple Watch ahead of availability, we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch.
* To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.
* It was reported yesterday that people who won’t pre-order their device tomorrow could run into problems when trying to order it at launch. Based on Apple’s German and UK web stores, some Watch models show up to six-week lead times for select models.

* Would-be shoppers can try on the device at their local Apple Store or at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London and select Apple Authorized Resellers in Japan and China.
* And from April 24, the Apple Watch will also be available at boutiques in major cities including colette in Paris, Dover Street Market in London and Tokyo, Maxfield in Los Angeles and The Corner in Berlin, as well as through select Apple Authorized Resellers in China and Japan.
