* Pebble today announced a new messaging feature for iOS users designed to make it possible to send text messages through a carrier.
* Dubbed Text Reply for iOS, this feature is in beta and available on the Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel and Pebble Time Round family of smartwatches.
* In addition, Text Reply for iOS is currently an AT&T exclusive though Pebble says it’s working on bringing this capability to Pebble fans on other carriers.
* “Pebble is excited to introduce Text Reply for iOS, a beta feature making us the first non-Apple smartwatch to bring voice and text replies to our iPhone users,” notes the company. This feature allows you to respond to incoming items with a voice reply or canned text replies from the iOS Messages app.
* Any text reply gets sent as an SMS through AT&T directly, and not the Messages app. As a result, sent text replies do not appear in Apple’s Messages app on your iPhone.
* You need a postpaid AT&T data plan to take advantage of Text Reply for iOS.
* Here’s how to get started:
* “We are working to enable additional carriers and services to provide actionable notifications to more and more iPhone users,” said Pebble.
* In addition to support for Text Reply, the freshly updated Pebble Time 3.4 iPhone companion app includes better support for the Pebble Time Round smartwatches and Pebble Time 3.6 and older firmwares, as well as bug fixes and stability improvements.
* More information about Text Reply for iOS is available in this FAQ.
