* Over the past few weeks, we’ve watched as iPhone 5 supply slowly leveled out with consumer demand. Shortly after launch, availability of the handset slipped to 3-4 weeks, and it has since improved to two weeks, one week, 2-4 days.
* Then today, shoppers noticed that shipping estimates for the smartphone on Apple’s web store have completely disappeared, meaning that it’s in stock and available for immediate shipping for the first time since September…
* As noted by MacRumors, the iPhone 5 is now showing ‘In Stock’ on Apple’s website. This goes for both colors, all three sizes, and we’re seeing this in the United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico, and a few other countries.
* This is great news for Apple, who is right in the middle of an aggressive international rollout. Earlier today it launched the handset in Korea, and will be rolling it out to 50 other countries — including China — later this month.
* We’re also entering into the homestretch of the all-important holiday quarter where despite steep competition from LG and Samsung, Apple’s hoping to sell 40 million iPhones, which would be an all-time high for the company.
