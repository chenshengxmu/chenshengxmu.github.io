* Great news for all of you folks waiting for the next big app sale to grab some iOS games. Electronic Arts has just kicked off its Labor Day promotion, shaving prices on a number of their most popular titles.
* And don’t worry, this sale is much better than the recent Back to School one. Most everything has been discounted down to $.99, and there are dozens of both iPhone and iPad games to choose from…
* There are many games on sale, but these are just a few of our favorites:
* Everything you see here has been discounted down to $.99, which equates to about $9 off for some titles. If you’re interested, you can follow any one of the above links to the App Store for more information.
* Even if you don’t plan on playing some of these games right away, the savings alone is worth downloading the ones you want now, and deleting them. iCloud will always let you re-download them later.
* Labor Day is Monday, September 3rd, so we expect the sale to go on at least through then.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
