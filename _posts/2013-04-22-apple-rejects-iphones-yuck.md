* When Apple introduced the iPhone 5 last fall, it made sure to mention its complex manufacturing process. “Never before have we built a product with this extraordinary level of fit and finish,” Jony Ive said during a video on the handset.
* The extra effort has obviously paid off, as the iPhone 5 has been very popular with consumers. But it’s also causing problems for Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, who continues to struggle with the device’s intricate production methods…
* The Register (via 9to5Mac) points to a new report from China Business:
* “Foxconn has apparently botched a batch of iPhones, which Apple returned to the contract manufacturer because they were not fit for sale.
* Details of just what went wrong are sketchy, as the source for this tale is an anonymous Foxconn staffer chatting to China Business. That report, after being forced through a couple of translation engines, suggests Apple sent back at least five million iPhones, and maybe as many as eight million, “due to appearance of substandard or dysfunctional problems.”
* If true, this is bad news for both companies. With manufacturing costs around $200 per handset, Foxconn would have to eat in upwards of $1 billion to cover the bad batch. And it would leave Apple with shorter-than-expected iPhone supply.
* Foxconn’s been having problems with iPhone 5 production from the get-go. There’s been several reports of quality control issues since the handset launched last fall, with many consumers complaining of scratches—particularly on black models.
* In fact, the device’s complicated manufacturing process sparked a riot in one of Foxconn’s plants last fall, as workers clashed with management, claiming Apple set the quality bar too high. Foxconn was forced to temporarily shut down the factory.
* It’ll be interesting to see what effects, if any, this has on Apple moving forward. Could the ongoing production issues cause the company to rethink the design of its next-gen handset? Interestingly enough, the iPhone 5S is expected to be delayed.
