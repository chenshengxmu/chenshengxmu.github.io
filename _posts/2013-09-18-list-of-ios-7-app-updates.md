* With Apple releasing iOS 7 today, a number of popular apps have posted updates in order to make sure they work properly with the new firmware. Some are just minor compatibility updates, and others are complete redesigns.
* Instead of trying to do individual posts about each of these updates, we’ve decided to keep a running list of all of them so that you can get an idea of which applications have been updated and what the new versions look like…
