* In perhaps the biggest change to its service since its inception, Twitter on Tuesday announced a bunch of changes meant to distance itself from the controversial 140-character-per-tweet rule.
* As previously rumored, media links generated by attaching photos, animated GIFs, videos, polls, quoted tweets and direct messages—along with @names in replies—will no longer count toward the limit.
* Other changes include the addition of the retweet button on your own tweets and automatically exposing any tweets which begin with a username to all your followers.
* The latter feature is bound to be welcomed by Twitter’s community, even more so by newcomers who are more often than not confused by Twitter’s rules.
* Currently, tweeting out something that starts with a @user mention would only make the tweet visible to that person. People have been circumventing this rule by starting such tweets with a period, followed by a @user mention and the text of the tweet.
* Although @names that auto-populate at the start of a reply tweet will no longer count towards the character limit, new non-reply tweets starting with a @mention will count, as will @mentions added explicitly by the user in the body of the tweet.

* Here’s everything that’s changing, as per Twitter:
* These changes will be available over the coming months so that app makers have enough time to make any needed updates to their Twitter clients built with Twitter’s official APIs.
