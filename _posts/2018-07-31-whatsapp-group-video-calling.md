* Facebook-owned WhatsApp yesterday brought group calling to its users.
* Like chats, audio messages and other content, group video calls conducted on the platform are end-to-end encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. Group calling supports up to four people total.
* Starting a group call is perhaps counterintuitive a bit.
* Firstly, you must initiate a one-on-one voice or video call on WhatsApp. And secondly, you must tap a new button labeled Add Participant, located in the top-right corner of the interface. Only then are you permitted to add more contacts to your current call.
* They’ve designed group calling to work globally in different network conditions.
* First announced at Facebook’s annual F8 developer conference in May, the new feature is rolling out to iPhone and Android users. Group calling is a staggered rollout and as such might take a while until it becomes available to all WhatsApp users globally.
* WhatsApp is a free download from App Store.
