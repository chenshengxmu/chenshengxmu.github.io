* Instagram lovers, if you’ve also got a jailbreak at your fingertips, then you won’t want to miss out on a chance to download a new free jailbreak tweak called Rocket for Instagram from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* Rocket for Instagram provides Instagram users with a slew of new features that Instagram themselves have failed to provide for years. In this piece, we’ll briefly go over some of the new features with you.
* Rocket for Instagram could be categorized as an Instagram user’s dream tweak, because it’s going to let you do things that the photo and video sharing social network probably doesn’t want you to do, but nevertheless they’re things you, the user, have wanted for a long time.

* Among the new features Rocket for Instagram brings to the table are:
* In addition, another feature noted to be in the tweak is a new way to promote your own content so you can get more likes. Dubbed ‘Rocket,’ the feature adds a new red button to the bottom of your Instagram app where you can enter the hub for liking other people’s promoted content, and earn points towards promoting your own content.
* The tweak doesn’t add a traditional preferences pane to the Settings app like most tweaks do; instead, it adds its settings directly to the Instagram app itself. Simply go to your Instagram profile and tap on the Settings cog to launch the Instagram settings, and then tap on the Configuration preferences pane in the Settings list to access all of your options for Rocket for Instagram:

* From the options, you can:
* Rocket for Instagram looks like a solid jailbreak tweak release for the App Store’s free Instagram app. If you’re into Instagram, and you’re jailbroken, I would recommend you check the tweak out. On the other hand, Instagram ++, which is also free in Cydia, offers pretty much all of the same features, but lacks the hub for attracting more likes for your photos.
* Many of the features that come with the tweak are going to be useful for those who manage multiple accounts, such as those that need to be re-sharing content for users, or need a quick way to see if someone has followed you back or not.
* I find that the ability to disable read receipts, save media from my Instagram feed, zoom in on profile pictures, and zoom in on Instagram feed pictures are all useful features that I would easily use on a daily basis and many other Instagram lovers will enjoy as well.
* If you’re an Instagram user looking to enhance your abilities within the app and obtain features that no stock user is ever going to get, Rocket for Instagram could be your new best friend. It’s available as a free download in Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now, and of course, it also requires that you have the free Instagram app installed from the App Store.
