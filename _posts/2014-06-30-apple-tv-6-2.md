* Apple today released a trio of major updates, one giving the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices improved iBeacon connectivity and the other enabling enhanced Wi-Fi performance and better reliability when waking up your Mac from sleep, among other changes.
* The third update is focused on the $99 Apple TV media-streaming box. Now available in Software Update, the Apple TV 6.2 firmware brings no new features and appears to be a simple maintenance update accompanying the aforementioned iOS 7.1.2 and OS X 10.9.4 updates…
* Direct download links are available through our Downloads page.
* The Apple TV 6.2 software update carries a build number of 11D257c and is available for second and third-generation Apple TV devices.
* Your Apple TV should install it automatically. If not, go to Settings > General > Software Updates and select Update Software to manually apply the bug-fix update.
* Again, there don’t seem to be any new features in this update other than bug fixes, but if you’ve noticed other changes, drop us a line on tips@iDownloadBlog.com or post in comments and I’ll update and credit accordingly.
