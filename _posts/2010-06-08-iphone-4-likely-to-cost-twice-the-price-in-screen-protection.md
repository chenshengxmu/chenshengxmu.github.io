title: iPhone 4 Likely to Cost Twice the Price in Screen Protection

* Part of the iPhone 4 presentation yesterday was the fact that both the front and the back of the iPhone will be made of glass. When I heard the news, I thought to myself “wow, it’s gonna look so nice”. Then a few seconds later my mind went a different way and I started to realize that with the iPhone 4, I’ll have twice the trouble of protecting the screen.
* I’m not big into screen protection. Products such as the Invisible Shield do a great job at protecting the iPhone but I like my iPhone naked. No case, no screen protector.
* Things might change with the iPhone 4.
* Apple’s description of their new engineered glass is however quite reassuring:
* All the breakthrough technology in iPhone 4 is situated between two glossy panels of aluminosilicate glass — the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains. Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic, the glass is ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever. It’s also recyclable.
* But will this be enough to protect the back of the phone against time? I really doubt it.
* On top of worrying about protecting the front, you now will have to worry about shattering the front AND the back of your iPhone should you accidentally drop it.
* I won’t change my mind. I won’t apply a screen protector but I know I’ll be twice as careful with the 4 as I was with my 3G.
* What about you? Will you stick your iPhone 4 in a case or under a screen protector?
