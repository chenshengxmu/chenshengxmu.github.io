* As promised, Apple on Monday started rolling out a new trade-in initiative aimed at Android phone owners who would like to upgrade to an iPhone. Part of Apple’s existing Reuse and Recycling Program, the non-iPhone trade-in is now rolling out in the United States and several European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy.
* Eligible non-iPhone devices include smartphones running Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone operating systems.
* As per usual, Apple has partnered with a third-party company called Brightstar on device buybacks and trade-ins. In addition to older iPhone models, eligible non-iPhone devices include select handsets from Samsung, BlackBerry, Sony, HTC, Nokia and LG.
* Depending on the condition of their device, customers will receive their credit via an Apple Store gift card or through bank transfer. The credit can only be redeemed against the purchase of a new iPhone 5c, iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.
* It cannot be used toward the purchase of an Apple Watch, a Mac or any other products aside from the aforesaid iPhones. You can get an estimate of your device at the Brightstar website.
* Apple’s Reuse and Recycle program is set to launch in China tomorrow, as per Bloomberg, but won’t include non-Apple smartphones.
* The iPhone trade-in is currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
* As noticed by MacRumors, Apple through the expanded Reuse and Recycling Program is also accepting various PC models by select vendors. Computer trade-ins are being handled by third-party firm Dataserv.
