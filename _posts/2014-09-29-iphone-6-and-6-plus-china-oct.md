* Apple has announced this morning that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will be available in China beginning Friday, October 17. The devices will be launching in the company’s online store, as well as its retail stores and various other chains and Authorized Resellers in the country.
* Both handsets will support TD-LTE and FDD-LTE, and be offered by China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom across mainland China. Apple says that customers can pre-order the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from its online store in two weeks, beginning on Tuesday, October 14.
* The news comes shortly after reports claimed that Apple had secured the final license it needed to begin selling its new handsets in China. A timeframe for the launch had thus far been largely unknown, as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology had not granted its approval.
* China is an extremely important market for Apple—one where it currently enjoys very little marketshare. The country houses two of the largest wireless providers in the world: China Mobile, the largest carrier with over 800 million subscribers, and #4 China Unicom, with nearly 300M.
