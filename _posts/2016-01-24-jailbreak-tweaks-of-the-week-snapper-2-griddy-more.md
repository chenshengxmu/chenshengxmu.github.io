* Cydia has been the epitome of the calm before the storm this week, lacking any robust new jailbreak tweak releases, but keeping up with each day by providing some freebies that can help you customize your device to your liking.
* Despite the somewhat quiet week, some tweaks released this week could be worth your time to take a look at. These are the jailbreak tweaks released this week that we found the most interesting:

* One of the coolest releases this week has been Snapper 2, a jailbreak tweak that allows you to take and place a screenshot overlay anywhere on your screen while you do other things at the same time. This tweak is particularly useful in situations where you want to see two things side-by-side from different apps or webpages, such as the Apple computer spec comparison you see in the screenshot example above.
* Snapper 2 is not technically a “new” release, but it is a re-release of the original tweak with full compatibility for iOS 9. Regardless, the tweak comes with a ton of options for configuring how you’ll use it – these options include your own Activator gesture, choosing the appearance of your screenshot overlays, configuring your own screenshot behavior, and looking at a screenshot history.
* To learn more about the workings of Snapper 2, be sure to read our full review where we cover its features in depth.

* Griddy offers a fresh new take on the App Switcher in iOS with a grid-style view instead of a card-by-card view that iOS users have been used to seeing since iOS 7. It’s one of my favorite tweaks released this week because of its unique footprint in the iOS App Switcher department.
* Not only does it look cool, but it’s programmed with a ton of useful gestures for managing your App Switcher apps in any way you see fit. There are ways to customizing the way it looks so that the apps are better formatted on the display, and you can even fine-tune details like blurring, sizes, and more.
* If you’re interested to learn more about the inner workings of Griddy, our full review is going to provide the most insight.
