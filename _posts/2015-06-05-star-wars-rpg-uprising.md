* Star Wars fans have a lot to be excited about this year. There’s, of course, the new movie ‘The Force Awakens’ that’s coming out in December, and a handful of new console games are on the way. There’s also apparently a new RPG coming to mobile devices.
* Publisher Kablam has begun teasing its upcoming role-playing game, Star Wars Uprising, which will debut on various mobile platforms later this year. It will serve as a bridge, connecting the events of Return of the Jedi and this year’s new Star Wars film.

* In the days following the Battle of Endor and the fall of the Emperor, The Anoat sector has been locked down by the Empire. With the Rebel Alliance on the other side of the Iron Blockade, it falls to the sector’s smugglers, freedom fighters, bounty hunters and gangsters to join forces and form an uprising.
* The Galaxy needs a new hero. What kind will you be?
* Speaking with Wired, Kabam senior vice president Aaron Loeb described Uprising’s gamplay as “dungeon crawler-esque.” Players will create their own characters, and spend their time exploring game levels and killing enemies with “gesture-based” action.
* As with most RPGs, players will uncover powerful new gear in their travels, which will help increase their characters’ abilities. This is where free-to-play angle comes in, although Loeb promises IAPs won’t prevent you from progressing forward in the game.
* Typically, movie tie-in titles aren’t something to get excited about, but it sounds like Kablam has assembled an incredible team. Among the staff veterans from EA’s Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Clone Wars series, and LucasFilms helped write the story.
* Star Wars Uprising is expected to launch sometime before Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens hits theaters this winter. For more information on the game, or to pre-register a Kablam account to use in Uprising, visit playstarwarsuprising.com here.
