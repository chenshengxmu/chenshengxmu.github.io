title: iOS 9 jailbreak beta announced for some 32-bit devices

* Developer jk9357 has announced the release of an iOS 9 jailbreak, for 32-bit devices only. The name of the tool is Home Depot, and although some users have reported the tool is not working on their device yet, the news will be warmly received by those whose legacy devices have been so unloved of late.
* The tool claims it ‘probably’ supports iOS 9.3-9.3.4, and ‘maybe’ supports iOS 9-9.3. In practice, most of the reported installs have been on iOS 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.3.3 and 9.3.4. The fact that it does not support iOS 9.3.5 hints at the inclusion of Trident exploits in its working.
* A supported device list is on the jailbreak tool’s website, but I reproduce it here too:
* Please take this supported list with a grain of salt, because the developer has mentioned more recently that iPhone 5 (Global) – iOS 9.2.1, iPhone 4s – iOS 9.3.1 and iPad 2 – iOS 9.3.2 are not currently working, even though they are on the list.
* Additionally, the iPhone 5c (Global) – iOS 9.3.2, which I tested myself, did not work out of the box. However, these failures may not be a cause for concern, as they may be nothing more than missing or incorrect offsets at the moment. I was able to get the jailbreak working in my case by manually specifying offsets (a useful option which has been included in the jailbreak app), so at least in some cases the lack of support is easily fixed.
* If you believe the tool is not working for you due to its incomplete offsets, check out the jailbreak’s website, where the dev has helpfully listed user-submitted offsets which you can try instead.
* Home Depot includes Cydia, Substrate, and tfp0 functionality, as well as a mixtape for your edification. To use the jailbreak, download it from the developer’s website, and sideload it with Cydia Impactor in the same way as the Yalu jailbreaks. You can use our guide to installing and jailbreaking with Impactor and Yalu. Simply use the Home Depot .ipa instead of the Yalu .ipa.
* I do not necessarily recommend using the tool at present, as it was not very stable in my case, and remains a beta. However, with so many devices supported, your experience may differ from mine. If you have a spare device and want to experiment, knowing the risks, then let me know how it goes!
* I’ll keep you up to date if and when any further revisions of the tool are released. For now, 32-bit device users can rejoice in finally rejoining the jailbreak party they have been excluded from since the rise of the 64-bit-only jailbreak with Pangu 9.1.
