* OneHanded is a jailbreak tweak for 4.7 and 5.5-inch devices that enables the hidden one-handed keyboard found this week by iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith.
* This is great for anyone who finds typing on these devices without two hands difficult, preventing you from having to over extend your thumbs to tap on keyboard keys.
* You can read our full review of OneHanded to learn more about it.
* ShutterSoundSwitch – FREE
