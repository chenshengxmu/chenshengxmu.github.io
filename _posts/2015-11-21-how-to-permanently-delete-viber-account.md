* Our previous tutorials have taught you how to delete a WhatsApp account, as well as your Facebook and Instagram account, along with any underlying user data. But we understand that not everyone is a fan of Facebook-owned services.
* For instance, some people prefer Viber for their instant messaging needs. Those pondering leaving Viber might be wondering if they can deactivate their account and delete their data.
* In a word, yes. In this tutorial, we’ll tell you everything there’s to know pertaining to deleting a Viber account, guide you through the account deactivation process and inform you what happens to your data after the account is killed.
* Keep in mind that simply removing the Viber app from your device is not the same as deactivating your account. But if you do delete the Viber app, the following will happen:
* To instantly deactivate your Viber account, follow the steps outlined further below.
* Deactivation of a Viber account can only take place within the application itself. If you have already uninstalled Viber and would like to deactivate your account, you will need to re-install Viber in order to do so.
* Ensure that you have the latest version of Viber for iOS or Viber for Mac prior to deactivating your account.
* This is what happens after you deactivate a Viber account on your device:
* IMPORTANT: Once your account is deactivated, there is no way to restore any of your user data. Viber does not store any of your message history and is unable to retrieve lost data. Re-registering to Viber with the same mobile phone number will not restore the previous account history.
* Having said that, it might be a good idea to create a backup of your Viber chats for safekeeping prior to deactivating your account.
* In order to create a full backup of your chat history prior to deleting your Viber account, follow the steps outlined right below:
* Step 1: Launch Viber on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on More in the tab area alongside the bottom.
* Step 3: Select Settings to access options.
* Step 4: Choose Calls and Messages.
* Step 5: Select Email message history.
* This will bring up the mail compose sheet. Type in your own email address in the TO: field and tap Send to send yourself the attached ZIP file containing Viber’s message history.
* IMPORTANT: Your backed up history is provided for your convenience and cannot be restored onto this or another device. Messaging history backup is available on Android and iPhone only.
* Step 1: Launch Viber on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on More in the tab area alongside the bottom.
* Step 3: Select Settings to access options.
* Step 4: Choose Privacy.
* Step 5: Select Deactivate Account.

* You will be warned that continuing with the deactivation process will clear all of your data on this device and deactivate Viber on all your other devices.
* Step 6: Tap Deactivate to proceed.
* You can now delete the Viber app from this device.
* Step 1: Launch Viber on your Mac, Windows or Linux PC.
* Step 2: Choose Preferences in the Viber menu (Mac) or click the settings icon at the bottom left of the screen (Windows/Linux).
* Step 3: A new window will pop up. Choose the Account tab to continue.
* Step 4: Now select Deactivate Viber.

* This will remove all of your data and deactivate Viber from your desktop only.
* You can now drag the Viber app from your Mac’s Applications folder into the Trash. Viber will remain active on your primary device (your iPhone) so you’ll need to deactivate the app there, too.
* Step 1: Download and launch Viber on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Follow the on-screen instructions to re-register your mobile phone number with the service. This will reinstate the previous account on your new device. Your message and call history will not be restored.
