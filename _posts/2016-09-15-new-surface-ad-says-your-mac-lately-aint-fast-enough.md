* It’s been only three days since Microsoft’s advertising department unleashed a new ad salvo at Apple’s direction in the form of a commercial for its Surface Pro 4 tablet/laptop hybrid and now it’s posted yet another video to conveniently reiterate its message ahead of iPhone 7’s launch tomorrow. Titled “Power of Touch”, the 30-second commercial doubles down on the ”the Mac lacks a touchscreen” theme.
* Not only does Microsoft poke fun of the fact that Macs are long overdue for a refresh (yours supposedly “ain’t fast enough” lately), but also disses the Mac for not shipping with a detachable keyboard or a stylus.
* That your Mac “lately ain’t fast enough” is “just a shame” after all those years.
* The ad goes on to diss Macs—that is, the MacBook Airs—for their low-resolution screen. Watch the video for yourself and let us know what you think in comments.

* I guess we should all sell our Macs right away and rush to buy ourselves one of the Surface Pro 4 devices because they come with an Intel inside and run the full Office suite and other desktop Windows apps. There’s another ad that criticizes the Mac’s lack of a detachable keyboard, a touchscreen and a stylus.
* Now, the first Surface ad featuring that singer was quite amusing but the latest ones could have been done better and aren’t very funny, in my personal opinion.
* Tell us how you feel about these new Surface ads down in the comments.
