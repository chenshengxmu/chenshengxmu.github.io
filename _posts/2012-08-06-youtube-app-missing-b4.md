* Earlier today, Apple pushed out iOS 6 beta 4 to developers. It’s the fourth update to Apple’s latest mobile software, which is expected to become available to the public sometime in September.
* Judging by the lengthy change log we’ve been reading through all morning, beta 4 is full of bug fixes and other improvements, and not much else. But we have noticed one notable change…
* As pointed out by 9to5Mac, the default YouTube application is missing in the new beta. After hearing this report we checked our own devices with iOS 6 beta 4, and sure enough, it’s gone.
* Fear not, apparently the omission has something to do with an expired licensing agreement, and Google is working on a new YouTube app that will be be available in the App Store.
* The Verge has Apple’s statement:
* “Our license to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended, customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App store.”
* For the time being, folks on iOS 6 beta 4 can continue to use the YouTube web app in Safari. We’ll be sure to let you know as soon as an official app makes it into the App Store.
