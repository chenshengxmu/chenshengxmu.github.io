* It seems like it’s been forever since we’ve seen a TinyUmbrella update. The SHSH blob-saver has been noticeably absent throughout the summer as Apple has released multiple iOS 6 betas.
* But notcom, the utility’s creator, broke the silence this week, announcing that TU has finally been updated to support the new software. It now works with iOS 6 and the latest Apple TV firmware…
* From notcom’s blog:
* “Sorry for the delay folks… with funerals and travel and changing jobs I’ve had quite the summer. I’ve updated TU for apple tv 5.0.2 (sorry for the wait!) as well as all of the iOS 6 betas.”
* Since TinyUmbrella works with the GM version of iOS 6, we’re assuming that it also works with today’s public iOS 6 release. More importantly, it works with iOS 5.1.1. Save your blobs people!
* It’s also worth noting that, for you Mac OS X users, the way that TU is packaged has changed. Due to the new Gatekeeper feature in Mountain Lion, TU now comes as a zip file, not an installer.
* You can grab the latest version of TinyUmbrella from our Downloads page. Just remember to run it with all of your iOS devices before you update today. iOS 6 has not been jailbroken yet.
