title: Dev Team Jailbreaks iPhone OS 4 In Just 19 Hours
---
* That has to be one of the fastest jailbreak ever! Just about 19 hours after Apple gave us a sneak peek at the future of iPhone OS and made the beta available to developers, the Dev Team managed to jailbreak iPhone OS 4.
* MuscleNerd just tweeted the following along with a video of a jailbroken iPhone running OS 4 and Veency, a VNC app for jailbroken iPhones.
* Something youâ€™ll only find on JB 4.0: VNC ðŸ™‚ http://is.gd/blzeg (BTW donâ€™t bother with betas, theyâ€™re *very* buggy!)
* There is no realease date and I donâ€™t think this jailbreak will even be made available until the official release of iPhone OS 4. Still, Iâ€™m getting all excited just thinking about it.
* Youâ€™re excited too, arenâ€™t you?
