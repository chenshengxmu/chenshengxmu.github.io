* Vine, Twitter’s new app for sharing short 6-second clips, has had somewhat of a rocky start. Immediately following its launch two weeks ago, Twitter got inundated with complaints that the Editor’s Pick section was populating users’ video feed with adult content. Twitter blamed the problem on “a human error” and promised to fix it in the next update. And just like clockwork, Vine version 1.0.5  landed today on the App Store, bringing with better sharing and the 17+ age rating (was 12+)…
* While the updated software now supports sharing to Twitter or Facebook after posting , the big news is the 17+ age rating aimed at saving teens from anonymous masturbators who hide their “work” behind the #porn tag.
* Your changelog:
* • share to Twitter or Facebook after posting. Find the post you want to share, then tap the “…” button in the bottom right • report or block a profile. Go to the profile, then tap the newly added “…” button in the top right • fixed an issue that caused a black screen to appear and uploads to fail after creating a video on certain devices • miscellaneous bug fixes

* And if some horny user keeps on bombarding your feed with explicit clips, you can now report or block their profile by taping the newly added “…” button in the top right.
* That, along with a few bug fixes, should be enough to keep parents happy.
