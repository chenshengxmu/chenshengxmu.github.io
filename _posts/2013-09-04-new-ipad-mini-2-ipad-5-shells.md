* We must be getting close to an iPad refresh, because the leaks are becoming more and more prevalent. Hot on the heels of the video that surfaced this morning of an alleged iPad 5 shell, comes a similar clip showcasing a second generation iPad mini.
* The clip comes from the same source as the first video, and it claims to show the shell of a next-gen iPad mini along with an iPad 5 shell and current mini for comparison. The two 7.9-inch tablets look very similar, but there’s one notable difference…
* Here’s the clip, which once again comes from Lewis Hilsenteger of the YouTube channel Unbox Therapy:
* The biggest, and perhaps only, difference between the current iPad mini shell and the one supposedly belonging to the next-gen model is the mirrored Apple logo on the latter. The logo on the first-gen mini is black on both the white and black versions.
* This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the mirrored logo, either. It’s shown up on a number of purported leaked ‘iPad mini 2’ shells—which up until now have only been photographed—and it’s been present on nearly every iPad 5 shell we’ve seen in photos/videos.

* While the new logo won’t be anything to write home about, the next iPad mini is expected to have at least one major new feature: a Retina display. The original mini featured a dull 1024×768 screen, and it was one of the only gripes reviewers had with the device.
* So when will we see this next generation iPad mini? We don’t anticipate it, or the iPad 5 for that matter, making an appearance at next week’s event. Instead, it looks more likely that Apple will host another media shindig sometime in October to unveil its new tablets.
