* The latest beta version of Apple’s desktop operating system — OS X 10.8.4 — has been released to developers. This new iteration of Mountain Lion is labeled as build 12E27, and thus far, details on what new features it contains are scarce.
* Like Apple often does with its desktop beta releases, it has asked developers to focus on specific aspects of the OS, those being Wi-Fi, Graphics Drivers and Safari.
* Once we hear more about what new features, if any, that OS X 10.8.4 contains, we will be sure to provide you with an update. In the meantime, if you’re a developer, you can download OS X 10.8.4 build 12E27 directly from Apple’s developer portal.
* Let us know what you find or experience if you decide to take it for a spin on your test machine.
