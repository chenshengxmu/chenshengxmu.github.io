* Since the iPhone’s inception, Apple’s mobile Safari browser has had this neat little feature for quickly jumping to the very top of any webpage simply by tapping the status bar.
* Following a major redesign of Apple’s mobile operating system with the 2013’s release of iOS 7, Safari’s top and bottom toolbars now shrink and disappear as you scroll down. As a result, you must scroll back up a bit to access the URL field, bookmarks and other features in the toolbars.
* In this tutorial, you’re going to learn about a cool new shortcut that you can use to quickly reveal Safari’s toolbars without scrolling back up.
* Step 1: Open Safari on your iOS device and navigate to any website.
* Step 2: As you scroll down, the bottom toolbar disappears from your view and the address field at the top shrinks.
* Step 3: To show the toolbars, simply tap the bottom of the screen where the toolbar would normally be.

* Just like that, it will re-appear!
* As commenters pointed out, the same effect can be achieved by tapping iOS’s status bar, but I prefer this method due to the larger touch target.
* How do you like this neat trick?
