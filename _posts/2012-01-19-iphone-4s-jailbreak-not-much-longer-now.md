* We know. We’ve been telling you the same thing for the last three weeks now, but it seems that this iPhone 4S and iPad 2 jailbreak is right around the corner, as Chronic Dev Team frontman P0sixNinja just tweeted that it shouldn’t take much longer now.
* Of course, we’ve heard that before. Several times. But something tells me, this time it’s for good…
* not much longer now

* Today is Thursday. Just a couple more days until the weekend. Will Sunday be a Funday?
