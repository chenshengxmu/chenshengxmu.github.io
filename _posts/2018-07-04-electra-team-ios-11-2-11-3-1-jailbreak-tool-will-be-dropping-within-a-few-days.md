* Good news on Wednesday for those who’ve been eagerly awaiting a jailbreak for iOS 11.3.1: the Electra Team announced that their upcoming jailbreak tool would be released in coming days.
* As it would seem, the Electra Team will use an in-house APFS bypass to solve the remount issue that was delaying the tool’s release. Now all that appears to be left is a bit of packaging and polishing before Electra 11.3.1 becomes readily available to the public.

* After the news dropped, the official Electra website was updated with a status indicator that displays the team’s progress on the tool. As of this writing, the indicator is nearly full and displays the word “Packaging,” as shown above.
* Furthermore, a retweet from Atom Developments by Electra Team member CoolStar this week teases an upcoming project called Sileo, which promises to “revolutionize something you love doing.”

* There’s no official word yet concerning what Sileo will be, but there have been some circulating rumors and speculation on /r/jailbreak that it could be a Cydia alternative for installing jailbreak tweaks. Again, this is not yet confirmed, and information available as of now leaves a lot of wiggle room for interpretation.
* Notably, Electra 11.3.1 will automagically filter incompatible jailbreak tweaks from appearing in Cydia’s default repositories, such as BigBoss, ModMyi, and ZodTTD. A spreadsheet made available to developers allows them to mark their tweaks as compatible with iOS 11 so that jailbreak users can download them when the time comes.
* When officially released, Electra 11.3.1 will support all firmware versions from iOS 11.2-11.3.1; these firmware versions are vulnerable to Ian Beer’s tfp0 exploit, which played a meaningful role in the updated jailbreak tool’s development.
* Are you excited to jailbreak iOS 11.3.1? Let us know in the comments section below.
