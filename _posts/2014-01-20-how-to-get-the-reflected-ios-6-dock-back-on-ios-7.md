* For whatever reason — we’re not judging — you simply don’t like the blurred and translucent dock on iOS 7. We understand. A new jailbreak tweak by the name of ClassicDock is all you need, bringing the reflected iOS 6 dock right back to your Home screen on the newer version. It’s that simple.
* This is a fully plug-and-play extension that works its magic immediately after being installed in Cydia, with no options to configure in the Settings app. Read ahead for a few more details… 
* ClassicDock by iOS developer CoolStar is available now as a free download on Cydia from the default BigBoss repository. The tweak is compatible with most iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 7 or later, with iPhone 4 support coming soon.
* If you like simple tweaks like this one, be sure to take a look at today’s earlier mention of DynamicText. Or, share your own in the comments. We might just cover a few of our favorites.
