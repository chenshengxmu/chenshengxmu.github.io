* M.I.C. Gadget, which in the past supplied genuine pictures and clips of unreleased Apple devices, today published a video which they claim shows off Apple’s forthcoming four-inch iPhone obtained from a source at Foxconn.
* The clip could be an elaborate hoax, of course, but it looks genuine if you consider that the device appears to resemble a four-inch iPhone with an iPhone 6s-style design, as the rumor-mill’s predicted.
* For those wondering, this isn’t an iPod touch: notice the power button and the SIM card tray on the right side. But enough talk, give the video a quick watch and let us know what you think in the comment section.

* The so-called ‘iPhone 6c’ is expected to come outfitted with a larger battery than its predecessor, the iPhone 5c, and include either Apple’s previous-generation A8 or the latest A9 chip with 1 or 2GB of RAM.
* It should also support NFC for Apple Pay transactions and Touch ID. The device is rumored to be up for the formal announcement at a media event in March and go on sale in April.
