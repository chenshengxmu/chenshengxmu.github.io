* As it does every year, ZAGG is hosting a huge sale on its mobile device accessories this weekend. On Monday, May 26 and Tuesday, May 27 the company will be taking up to 50% off of everything site-wide for Memorial Day.
* For those not familiar with ZAGG products, they make a wide range of add-ons for both Apple and non-Apple products including iPad keyboards, iPhone cases and invisibleSHIELD screen protectors for over 6,500 devices…
* Here’s a breakdown of some of the bigger deals:
* We’ve reviewed a number of ZAGG accessories here on iDB over the years, including the invisibleSHIELD HD and the ZAGGsparq mobile charger, and in most cases we found them to be very well made, high-quality products.
* In addition to the discounts, ZAGG is also offering free shipping to all USA addresses. Again, the sale begins now and runs through Tuesday, but we recommend buying early because popular items usually sell out fast.
* Go to ZAGG.com
