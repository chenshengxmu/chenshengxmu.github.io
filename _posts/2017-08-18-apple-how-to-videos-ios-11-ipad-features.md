* Yesterday, Apple’s official YouTube channel was refreshed with half a dozen how-to videos detailing some of the major new features coming to iPad this fall with iOS 11, including the spring-loaded Dock, a new Files app, drag and drop, enhanced multitasking and more.
* The video tutorials, each running fifty seconds long, also highlight iPad multitasking gestures, an enhanced Markup feature that’s now available in more places, a new document scanner in the Notes app, an overhauled task switcher, an improved Control Center and more.
* Here they are.
* “You can add even more apps, open recent files, and drag and drop files using the new spring-loaded Dock.”
* “It’s simpler than ever to get productive with multitasking on iPad Pro and iOS 11.”
* “Get around iPad quickly with these time-saving gestures.”
* “With iOS 11 it’s faster and easier to mark up all kinds of things with Apple Pencil and iPad Pro.”
* “With iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and the new Notes app, scanning and signing a document has never been easier.”
* “With the new Files app, you can find all your important files in one convenient place. Browse recent files, manage favorites and even access files from your favorite cloud services.”
* iOS 11 will release as a free upgrade this fall.
* How do you like Apple’s new tutorial videos?
