* The iPhone 6 boasts Apple’s most impressive mobile camera to date. As part of the campaign to show off the newly developed technology, Apple created a “Shot on iPhone 6 World Gallery” on its webpage. The gallery includes many stunning photos of different subjects, three of which are highlighted in today’s Wallpapers of the Week section.
* Last week, we also included two images taken from the iPhone 6 World Gallery. After receiving several requests via Twitter for additional images, I found the following on a Spanish site, Botgard. Step inside for the latest downloads.
* As I mentioned, the following three images were sourced from Botgard. As the article is in Spanish, I cannot tell how exactly they were able to find the images in iPhone 6 resolution of 1080 x 1920. Because the images were most like pulled directly from the Apple site, originals cannot be gathered. Consequently, the image quality varies by image. However, having a slightly lower quality image may be acceptable for some, just to have the image at all. Take the images below with a little understanding that the quality is probably as good as it gets, without having access to the original photos shot by the listed artists.

* Thanks for consistently making the Wallpapers of the Week, one of the most read articles each week. The section would not be possible without the readers! I get tips and submissions each week from various iDB readers via @jim_gresham. Just like today’s post was shaped by the requests I received. Please, feel free to connect with me to help shape the future of the weekly post.
