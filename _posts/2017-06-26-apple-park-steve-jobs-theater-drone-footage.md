* Drone pilot Duncan Sinfield last Saturday published new aerial footage of the 175-acre Apple Park site on his YouTube channel, offering a glimpse at the entrance into the Steve Jobs Theater with its lobby light on.
* “Opening day is getting closer at Apple Park, landscaping and road-striping are not the only things wrapping up,” reads the video’s description.
* Located atop a hill at one of the highest points of the upcoming campus, the Steve Jobs Theater sports the world’s largest freestanding carbon-fiber rooftop.
* Featuring glass staircase spiraling downward to an underground 1,000-people auditorium, the Theater will be used for corporate meetings and Apple media events, meaning the unveiling of iPhone 8 will most likely take place there.
* “Steve’s vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us. He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,” said Tim Cook in April.
* The video revels significant progress being continually made on the main ring-shaped building, offering a nice look at the main atrium with its floor-to-ceiling glass doors.
* Landscaping work will continue for a few months after offices in the main ring-shaped building are completed. Since April, employees have been gradually moving into Apple Park.
