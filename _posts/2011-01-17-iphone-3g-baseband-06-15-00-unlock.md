* It’s official. If you have an iPhone 3G on baseband 06.15.00 and you are unlocked , you better get comfortable. MuscleNerd confirmed in a recent tweet that since the iPhone 3G will not be receiving the 4.3 firmware upgrade, your iPhone 3G will remain unlocked indefinitely.
* Now let’s not all panic, this only affects iPhone 3G users on the above mentioned baseband. If you are unsure of your baseband version, you can go to settings -> general -> about -> modem firmware.  For most of us this isn’t a huge deal, but to iPhone 3G users who unlocked using the 06.15 UltraSnow unlock, and have been experiencing GPS issues, this is devastating…
* For 3GS users experiencing problems, The Dev Team is definitely aware of the GPS issue, and currently working on a way to downgrade your baseband with iOS version 4.3.
* Do you have your 3G or 3GS unlocked and little or no GPS functionality? What are your thoughts on your iPhone being stuck unlocked forever? Sound off in the comments section below!
