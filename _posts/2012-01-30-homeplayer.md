title: HomePlayer- A Fully Focused Audio Interface for the Music App

* HomePlayer is a jailbreak tweak that brings a fully focused audio experience to your SpringBoard. It interfaces directly with the Music app to bring a full screen music playing session to the Home Screen.
* When I say “fully focused” I truly mean it, as the app completely disables the Home button’s functionality to prevent users from exiting the interface.
* It’s an interesting concept, although it can be a bit buggy at times. In the end it’s an obvious 1.0 tweak that can go as far as its developers decide to take it…
* HomePlayer presents a large photo of the current song’s album art in the middle of the interface. The art is surrounded by your normal music controls along with shuffle, volume, repeat, and AirPlay options.
* There’s also a nice provision that allows you to easily access a track’s lyrics from the convenience of the HomePlayer interface.
* This all being said, the tweak is very buggy from my experience. On more than a few occasions I experienced complete lock ups to my iPhone. Only by completely resetting my phone could I regain access to the Home screen. I’ve noticed that most of the bugs occur when using whatever Activator action you have setup to open and close HomePlayer, so that could have something to do with it.
* Other bugs I experienced were album art and song information not changing when switching to a new album, and complete lock ups when switching songs while using iCloud.
* I can’t really recommend this tweak due to the bugs in its current iteration, especially for $1.99. Perhaps in the future when some of its bugs are stamped out it will be worth a look.
* Have you tried HomePlayer? What has been your experience thus far?
