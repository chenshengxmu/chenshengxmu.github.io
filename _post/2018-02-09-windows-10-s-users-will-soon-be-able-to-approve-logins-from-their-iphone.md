* Microsoft is testing a new security feature for Windows 10 S, a stripped-down version of Windows 10 that only runs Windows Store titles, that would allow customers to use Microsoft’s Authenticator app for iPhone as a password replacement.
* As noted in Microsoft’s release notes accompanying the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build version 17093, customers will be able to set up their PC in a way that replaces login passwords with authorization through the Authentication app.
* This will let you go through the out-of-box experience, set up Windows Hello and access all your favorite apps and services, all without ever having to enter your password.
* “Starting with this build, your Windows 10 S PC will automatically make your experience password-free,“ said the Redmond software giant. Those who have the Windows Hello feature set up won’t see passwords anywhere in the Windows experience.

* Other changes in Windows 10 Insider Preview include various improvements related to the Game bar, diagnostic data, graphics (HDR video is coming to more PCs), new graphics settings for multi-GPU systems, Eye Control enhancements, new Windows Security and Bluetooth features, new features in the Edge browser and much, much more.
* The Authenticator app, a free download from App Store, lets you generate authentication codes for hassle-free logging into Microsoft’s services protected by two-factor authentication.
* You don’t even have to type in a six-digit code manually: as soon as you log in to a Microsoft service like Outlook from a new device, a rich notification pops up on your iPhone allowing you to approve the request with a single tap, no typing required.
* As noted by Thurrot.com on Friday, Microsoft’s internal roadmap indicates that Windows 10 S will at some point in the future be included as its own mode for all versions of Windows 10.
* Home and Education SKUs will be able to upgrade from Home S to Home for free, but going from Pro S to Pro will cost $49. On the commercial side, Pro S is only available with Core, Value, Entry and Small Tablet, with Core+ and Workstations being left out of the offering.
