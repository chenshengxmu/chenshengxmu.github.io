* T-Mobile has announced an iPhone and iPad leasing program that extends financing from Apple to businesses activating 25 or more lines. For a limited time, the Un-carrier is also covering the first $100 of each device leased through the program. The service is also being provided with no up-front cost and lower monthly payments than purchasing. 
* Through the program, business customers can get an iPhone 8 for $43 per month, which includes a $25 unlimited data plan. Thanks to leasing, a company can move the cost to an operating expense over 24 months. When buying the devices outright, the purchases are considered capital expenditures.
* Funded through DLL Group, Apple financing offers flexible and innovative leasing options for most current iPhone and iPad models as well as future devices. This is especially timely, of course.
* In one week, Apple’s expected to reveal new iPhones and iPads for 2018. These new products are likely to arrive in stores in the next few weeks.
* You can learn more about the program on the T-Mobile Enterprise site.
