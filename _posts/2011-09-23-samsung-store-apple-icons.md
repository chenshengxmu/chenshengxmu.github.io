* The legal battles between Apple and Samsung have gone ugly, and it seems this is just the beginning. But if Samsung wants to make a strong case for itself in court, the company had better get its act together.
* The above picture was taken in a new Samsung company store in Centro Sicilia, Italy. As you can see, the new store decors include icons of Apple’s own Safari and App Store apps…
* Quite embarrassing, to say the least!
* Looks like someone just lost his/her job at Samsung.
