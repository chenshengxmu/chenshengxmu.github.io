* If you play a lot of games on your iPhone, then you’re probably used to the idea of full screen apps negating the presence of the status bar. If you find that to be annoying, then a new jailbreak tweak entitled StatusTab may interest you. It allows you to sneak a quick peek at the status bar by swiping on the area where the status bar normally resides.
* Needless to say, StatusTab is a simple tweak, but the simple tweaks usually end up being some of the best tweaks. Take a look inside, and judge for yourselves.
* StatusTab will also allow you to access Notification Center by swiping down like you normally do once the status bar is exposed. Keep in mind that the tweak was designed to only allow you to access Notification Center when you swipe where the status bar clock resides. Swiping anywhere else results in the status bar disappearing from view.
* StatusTab can be downloaded free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. As always, please share your thoughts about it in the comment section below.
