* Spark, my new favorite email app by Readdle (good-bye Mailbox!), launched in the App Store nearly 3 months ago.
* In my initial review of Spark, I praised its gorgeous user interface, powerful productivity features and integration with popular services but cautioned mobile pros to wait until a future update brings a few commonly used features that didn’t make it into the initial release.
* Spark 1.1 is here and with it come some much-needed missing features that make the app more powerful and productivity-focused. These include brand new swipe options, support for HTML signatures, email aliases and more.
* A major update bringing what you’ve been waiting for, Spark 1.1 features support for email aliases and HTML signatures, introduces new swipe options and has the ability to move emails between different email accounts.
* With support for HTML signatures, you can now create email signatures with images and links. Like before, Spark lets you quickly cycle through your available signatures by swiping on your signature in the email compose screen.
* Email aliases for your Google, Yahoo and iCloud accounts are now supported, too. Spark 1.1 also lets you move messages between different email accounts. Say, you can move a Gmail message to your iCloud account, and vice versa.
* And when attaching files to a message from Dropbox, Box and other supported storage services, it’s now possible to attach multiple files at once, or add multiple photos from the iOS Camera Roll at once.
* Last but not least, newly added swipe options let you customize Spark with new actions like moving emails to Evernote, your spam folder and more.
* The following changes are listed for the Spark 1.1 update:
* New:
* Improved:
* Fixed:
* The previous Spark update added new bulk actions, a switch to disable loading of remote images and more. For the time being, Spark supports Exchange accounts through IMAP connections only but they’re working on enabling Exchange as a standalone email account type in Spark.
* Spark is available at no charge so this update is a free download as well.
* The iPhone app includes a WatchKit extension to check important messages on your wrist with a glance, reply to messages with canned responses or dictation via an Apple Watch app and more.
* The 61.4-megabyte app requires iOS 8.0 or later.
* Spark has a native interface on the iPhone and iPod touch but not on the iPad. The app is optimized for native display resolution of the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Grab Spark at no charge in the App Store.
