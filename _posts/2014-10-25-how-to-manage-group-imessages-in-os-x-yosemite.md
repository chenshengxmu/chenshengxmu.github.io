* Like iOS 8, OS X Yosemite brings tons of new features to the table when it comes to iMessage. You can now do interesting things like rename iMessage Conversations, add additional participants to a group message conversation, and leave a group iMessage conversation outright.
* Have a look at our video walkthrough after the break, which showcases these three new group iMessage features in OS X Yosemite.
* When participating in iMessage conversations, you can rename group iMessage threads by clicking on the Details button in the upper right-hand corner of the conversation. Click the name field at the top that says Untitled Group Chat, and type a name to rename the conversation.
* You can also add additional people to a group iMessage conversation. Again, on the Details page, tap the Add Contact section, and type the name of a contact that you wish to add. OS X will provide suggestions from your contacts based on the name you type. Click on the name to add an additional person to the conversation.
* It is also possible to leave a group iMessage conversation. To do so, click the Details button in the upper right-hand corner of a conversation thread, and click the Leave Conversation button at the bottom of the interface.
* What do you think about the enhancements made to the Messages app in OS X Yosemite? Will you be taking advantage of these new features?
