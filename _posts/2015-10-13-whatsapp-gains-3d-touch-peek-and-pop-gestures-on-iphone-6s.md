* Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging platform has received an update today, bringing support for 3D Touch gestures on new iPhones to the popular software.
* The new WhatsApp 2.2.18 allows you to press in-app content harder to Peek and Pop pictures, videos, links, contacts cards and locations in chats. Home screen shortcuts via 3D Touch are not available yet in this release.
* In addition, the app’s interface is now mirrored and optimized for right-to-left languages on iPhones running iOS 9.0 or later.
* Unfortunately, you cannot 3D Touch a conversation in the message list to preview its contents nor can you use the Quick Reply function to respond to a message from within its banner notification.
