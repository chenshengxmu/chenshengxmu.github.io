* Earlier today when Apple released iOS 5 beta 3, the news quickly came out that you could use the latest version of RedSn0w to jailbreak the new beta firmware. Indeed, by pointing RedSn0w to iOS 5 beta 1, you are able to jailbreak beta 3.
* However, an unexpected issue rapidly surfaced. After jailbreaking iOS 5 beta 3 with RedSn0w, it appeared that some App Store applications were not running properly. The Dev Team was quick to fix this issue and just released RedSn0w 0.9.8 beta 2…
* In a tweet sent a few minutes ago, Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd announced the release of RedSn0w 0.9.8 beta 2 to fix any issues you may have had after jailbreaking iOS 5 beta 3.
* We’ve update redsn0w to account for the sandbox changes that affected App Store apps in 5.0b3 (and it now recognizes the IPSWs for all three betas so far).  If you already jailbroke 5.0b3 using the previous redsn0w, you don’t need to re-jailbreak…just use this updated version to boot tethered.  Start pointing redsn0w at the 5.0b3 IPSW starting with 5.0b3.
* In short, if you already jailbroke iOS 5 beta 3 with RedSn0w, you don’t need to run the jailbreak again, simply use RedSn0w to boot tether your device.
* If you haven’t jailbroken your iDevice yet, follow our RedSn0w tutorial and point RedSn0w to iOS 5 beta 3.
* You may download the latest version of RedSn0w from our downloads section.
