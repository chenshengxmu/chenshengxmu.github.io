* Attention all Apple TV jailbreakers, FireCore has just released a new version of its popular jailbreaking utility known as Seas0nPass. The software is the ATV equivalent of an app like Absinthe.
* In the latest update, which brings Seas0nPass to version 0.8.2, FireC0re has added in a new stitching feature which makes downgrading to previous firmware versions possible…
* FireCore explains the update:
* “Today we are happy to release a new version of Seas0nPass that simplifies the installation of older firmware versions. This process called ‘stitching’ allows Seas0nPass to utilize previously saved firmware signatures to jailbreak and restore an Apple TV version that Apple may no longer be signing.
* Firmware signatures are required to install a particular firmware version onto iOS devices like the AppleTV. When installing latest version, these signatures will be created in real-time during the iTunes restore process.”
* We’ve updated our Downloads page with the new version of Seas0nPass, so if you’re looking for it you can find it there. If you haven’t jailbroken your Apple TV yet, be sure to check out our aTV page which is full of tutorials and other resources.
