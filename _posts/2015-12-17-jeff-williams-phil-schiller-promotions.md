* Apple today announced that it is promoting Jeff Williams to Chief Operating Officer. Williams has been the company’s Vice President of Operations and served as Tim Cook’s right-hand man during the latter’s multi-year tenure as Apple’s op-chief in the Steve Jobs era.
* Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing and the steward of its relationship with developers, will expand his role to include leadership of the App Stores across all Apple platforms.
* Furthermore, Johny Srouji is joining Apple’s executive team as Senior Vice president for Hardware Technologies, a position previously held by Bob Mansfield before his retirement and subsequent un-retirement.
* Srouji has spent nearly eight years at Apple since joining the company in 2008 to lead development of the iPhone 4’s A4 processor, the first Apple-designed system on a chip.
* As Vice President of Hardware Technologies, he is credited with building Apple’s silicon teams, overseeing custom chip and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple’s entire product line.
* Lastly, Tor Myhren will join the company from Grey Group in the first calendar quarter of 2016 as Vice President of Marketing Communications, reporting to Tim Cook.
* At Grey Group, Myhren has served as chief creative officer and president of Grey New York. He will be charged with Apple’s advertising efforts and will lead Apple’s internal teams responsible for video, motion graphics, interactive web design, packaging and retail store displays.
* “We are fortunate to have incredible depth and breadth of talent across Apple’s executive team. As we come to the end of the year, we’re recognizing the contributions already being made by two key executives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s boss.
* “Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I’ve ever worked with, and Johny’s team delivers world-class silicon designs which enable new innovations in our products year after year.”
* In putting Schiller in charge of all App Stores across the company, Apple is hoping to advance its ecosystem which has grown “from a single, groundbreaking iOS store into four powerful platforms and an increasingly important part of our business.”
* Schiller now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing.
* Apple’s Leadership webpage has been updated with these promotions.
