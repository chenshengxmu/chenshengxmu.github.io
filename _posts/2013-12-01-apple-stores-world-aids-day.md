* As it has in the past few years, Apple is recognizing December 1 as World AIDS Day. The company has posted a banner on its website’s home page, and several of its retail stores have begun coloring their Apple logos red.
* First observed in 1988, World AIDS Day is dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV—something Apple has shown an interest in with its long-term (Product) RED partnership…
* Here’s the message posted on Apple’s website (via MacRumors):
* “Every day 900 babies are born with HIV. (RED) works with companies like Apple to fight for an AIDS‑free generation by creating (PRODUCT)RED merchandise. A percentage of gross profits from the sale of those products goes to the Global Fund to help fund AIDS programs in Africa. Since its introduction, (PRODUCT)RED has generated more than $215 million for the Global Fund — more than $65 million from Apple alone. You can help make an impact by purchasing a (PRODUCT)RED iPod or (PRODUCT)RED accessories for iPhone and iPad.”
* It’s interesting how involved Apple is with (Product) RED, as it’s not really known for philanthropy. But it’s been selling RED products since 2006, and is the organization’s largest partner with over $65 million in contributions.
* Additionally, Jony Ive hosted a charity auction at Sotheby’s last month with his designer friend Marc Newson to benefit the foundation. The pair designed a number of one-of-a-kind products, helping raise some $12 million.
* The image you see above is of the Regent Street Apple Store in London, and many other flagship stores around the world are expected to follow suit.
