* Now that Apple TV 5.2 can be jailbroken via the new Seas0nPass, FireCore has updated its popular aTV Flash (black) software suite to support the new firmware. Apple released 5.2 at the end of last month alongside iOS 6.1.
* The aTV Flash (black) update, which brings the app to version 2.2, is fairly minor. But it does include several bug fixes, improvements to DVD playback, and of course, support for the new Bluetooth keyboard feature in 5.2…

* Here’s the tiny change log from FireCore’s blog:
* The Bluetooth keyboard support is especially useful with aTV Flash (black), as it includes Couch Surfer Pro—a built-in web browser that has its own Google Search bar, and is capable of viewing any HTML-5 encoded videos.
* It’s worth noting, though, that other third party plugins such as Plex, Remote HD, Rowmote, and XBMC are not yet compatible with the new Apple TV software. So keep all of this in mind before you even think about updating.
* But if you are going to update, you’ll have to re-download the app from FireCore’s website, once you’ve jailbroken Apple TV 5.2. If you already owned aTV Flash (black), the 2.2 update is completely free. Otherwise, it’s $29.95.
* Don’t worry, if you need help, we have a step-by-step tutorial on all of this.
