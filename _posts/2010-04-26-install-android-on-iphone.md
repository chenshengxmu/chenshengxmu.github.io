title: How to Install Android On iPhone
---
* Last week I posted about iPhone hacker PlanetBeing who successfully installed Android on an iPhone 2G. For those of you who would like to replicate this hack, Android A Lot has written a very detailed tutorial on how to install Android on an iPhone 2G.
* Installing Android on a jailbroken iPhone is not for the faint of heart. It involves quite a few steps and if you don’t have basic technical knowledge, I suggest you stay away from it. If you think you’re up to the task, then head over to Android A Lot to read the detailed tutorial.
* Additionally, you might find this video guide to installing Android on iPhone pretty useful. Note that this hack is for iPhone 2G only. As usual when messing around hacks live this one, understand you’re doing this at your own risks.
* If you decide to install Android on your iPhone, please share the results with us in the comments.
