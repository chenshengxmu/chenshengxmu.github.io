* Rearranging apps on the Apple TV works much like it does on iOS. First you enter into “wiggle mode” and then you move the user-installed apps to your preferred location. The big difference here is that everything’s done via the Siri Remote’s Touch surface instead of your finger. Still, moving apps on the Apple TV is super-easy to do; we’ll show you how in our brief video walkthrough.
* Step 1: highlight the app that you wish to move, and press and hold the Touch surface on the Siri Remote until the app begins to wiggle
* Step 2: swipe the Touch surface to move the app to your desired location
* Step 3: Click the Touch surface to exit wiggle mode.
* That’s all there is to it. The Apple TV makes app rearrangement pretty simple and straightforward. If you’re used to using iOS to manage apps, then it won’t take you long to pick up how to do so on the Apple TV. It may take a few minutes to get a hang of the new Touch surface on the Siri Remote, but after a while, you’ll have it down like a pro.
