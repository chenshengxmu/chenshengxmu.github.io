title: Prometheus Guide- Introduction

![img](http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/prometheus-guide-header.png)
* This is an introductory article which explains how to follow our two-part guide on using the Prometheus downgrade tool.
* Before attempting either Part 1 or Part 2 of the guide, everyone should read this article. It explains whether the guides apply to you, and if they do, which ones you should follow, as well as making sure that you fulfil the requirements for them to work.
* Now that the Yalu jailbreak has been released and has reached a reasonably stable state, many people have been asking how they can make the jump to iOS 10.2 to use the tool, having remained on a lower firmware until now in order to keep their existing jailbreak. Of course, it is traditionally not possible to move to an unsigned firmware like iOS 10.2, but as we have reported several times recently, the release of tihmstar’s suite of tools called Prometheus has changed this.
* Some users will now be able to move to iOS 10.2 even though the signing window has closed, so long as they meet certain requirements.
* Before you begin, please read the list of things to bear in mind below. You must be sure that you want to do this, and that it applies to you, before you start. Not everyone can use the Prometheus tools.
* If you’re looking to downgrade an older device, check out my futurerestore+libipatcher guide, which details how to use the tool on legacy 32-bit models.
* Do you satisfy all the requirements? Look at the section Requirements below and check that you have ticked all the boxes to make this possible.
* If you do not satisfy ALL the criteria, you cannot upgrade with Prometheus.
* If you fulfil the requirements and have the files ready, you can move onto the guides. There are two guides, some people must follow one, the majority must follow both:
* NonceEnabler Method:
* If you currently have a jailbreak and you want to move to a different firmware with Prometheus’ nonceEnabler method, you must follow Part 1 & Part 2 of the guide. This is the recommended method, and the one most people will use Prometheus for.
* Nonce collision Method:
* If you currently have no jailbreak, and you want to try to move to a different firmware with Prometheus’ nonce collision method, do only Part 2 of the guide, skip Part 1. Remember, this will not work except in certain cases; check the Requirements carefully before wasting your time.
* Good luck, I hope your restore is successful! Please don’t ask eligibility questions unless you have read this article carefully first. If you have a question which is not answered in the article, let me know in the comments!
