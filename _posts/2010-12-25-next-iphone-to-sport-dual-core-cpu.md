* The iPad rumors have been heating up as of late, with one analyst making speculations about what’ll be under the hood of the popular tablet’s next iteration. These rumors suggest that the iPad 2, or whatever Apple decides to call the iPad’s yet to be named successor, will feature a dual core chip.
* While that’s not a surprising suggestion, seeing as both Motorola and RIM have dual core tablets on the horizon, what did catch our eye is the revelation that the next iPhone might follow suit…
* “Apple is on track to refresh the iPad by March and iPhone by late summer. A key component upgrade across these platforms will be a dual-core processor featuring a pair of 1GHz ARM Cortex A9 cores.” – Ashok Kumar, an analyst at investment bank Rodman & Renshaw
* When you consider the fact that both the iPhone 4 and the iPad share the same processor — the Apple A4, which is basically just a rebadged ARM Cortex A8 combined with a PoweVR GPU — the upgrade makes sense, and certainly isn’t outside of the realm of possibilities.
* The ARM Cortex A9 is the next logical step for Apple’s hardware, but it will be interesting to see whether or not Apple allows the iPad to remain technically superior to the iPhone in the long term, or if they will allow the technological cat and mouse game to continue between their two flagship mobile platforms.
* Who’s ready for some real multitasking?
