* While the iPhone 7 isn’t expected to feature any major changes, Mac Otakara reports that there will be some notable differences on the front of the handset. Citing supply chain sources, the outlet says the device will feature an updated proximity sensor, a relocated ambient light sensor and larger earpiece.
* Recently, some manufacturers of LCD protection films on Alibaba.com have stopped receiving orders as iPhone 7 has its proximity sensor on the front changed to the dual specification in addition to the ambient light sensor on the side moving from the left side to the right while a slightly longer receiver. 
* iPhone 7 back face camera has become bigger while iPhone 7 Plus back face camera becomes dual, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus cases cannot be used while it’s also likely that front LCD protection films etc. cannot be used for the new model.
* If these rumors of larger sensors and dual lenses materialize, it seems very likely that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus customers will not be able to use legacy cases. That’s obviously going to draw some complaints, given that the 7 is so similar to the 6s, and next year’s iPhone is expected to feature a complete redesign.
* Other iPhone 7 reports call for a thinner profile, less prominent antenna lines, and of course, no 3.5mm headphone jack.
