* Apple faces a big day tomorrow as free three-month Apple Music trials are set to expire on Wednesday, September 30. Just yesterday, the firm posted a series of guided tour videos to help new and existing users understand the various features of the service.
* Ahead of the initial wave of free trial expirations, Apple is pushing notifications to those who signed up for a free-trial to encourage them to renew their membership.
* If you signed up for your first three months of free services and have forgotten to disable the Auto-Renew option, you can still do so before Apple charges your credit card on file, here’s how.
* As mentioned, you might want to disable auto-renewal in Apple Music unless you’re cool with seeing a $9.99 per month charge being applied to your credit card after your free trial expires tomorrow.
* Step 1: Open the Apple Music app on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* Step 2: Tap the Profile icon in the upper left corner and select the View Apple ID option.
* Step 3: Once you’ve entered in your Apple ID credentials, you’ll be taken to your Account Settings page. Locate the Subscriptions pane and tap Manage.
* Step 4. This will bring up a list of your subscription services. Select the one that says Apple Music.
* Step 5. In the Apple Music Membership pane, locate the Automatic Renewal switch and toggle it to the OFF position.

* While the user interface is too confusing compared with the likes of Spotify, Rdio and Pandora, Apple Music holds the major advantage of being tightly integrated with the rest of the ecosystem, and I love participating in the Apple ecosystem.
* Will you continue using Apple Music past the 3-month trial?
* Besides, it has arguably the world’s biggest selection of music and will only get better over time. According to our non-scientific poll conducted back in July, many of you were undecided about keeping your Apple Music membership post the trial period.
* Will you be canceling your Apple Music membership, do you think?
* Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
