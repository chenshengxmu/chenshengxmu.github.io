* Remember last week’s Apple stock tailspin launched by the high price in China of the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s? Talk centered on no-contract versions of the new handsets costing more than $730 and how Apple should just keep dreaming about competing against inexpensive Android alternatives.
* Forget all that, because China’s No. 2 and No. 3 carriers are out with prices on subsidized iPhones and they are low. In fact, one market observer believes the deals could beat even the most aggressive American offers…
* “It’s clear that Chinese buyers will have plenty of opportunities to avoid the full unlocked price,” writes Fortune’s Philip Elmer-DeWitt.
* Just as U.S. carrier compete by offering steep discounts, China Telecom and China Unicom – No. 2 and No. 3 carriers respectively – offer a number of ways to get both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c for “free”.
* In the case of China Telecom, it has three plans for a free iPhone 5s – all of course requiring a contract. By contrast, American carriers charge $199 for Apple’s latest device, after a two-year contract with a carrier.

* In the case of the iPhone 5c, China Unicom provides eight plans to get the $99 handset for free – and here’s your fine print – “as long as [Chinese consumers] are willing to lock themselves into a long and relatively expensive contract,” notes Elmer-DeWitt.
* As Bloomberg reports, China’s carriers are trimming past subsidies for Apple’s latest smartphones.
* In the case of China Telecom, a monthly plan for the iPhone 5s includes a subsidy of 2,890 yuan ($47), smaller than the 3,400 yuan subsidy for the iPhone 5. Although the carrier charges 4,488 yuan ($733 US) downpayment for a 16GB iPhone 5s, the handset is free with a two-year contract of 329 yuan ($53 US) per month.

* Likewise, the iPhone 5c is available free (read:subsidized) from China Telecom with a two-year contract of 389 yuan ($63 US), according to the report. According to a note by ISI analyst Brian Marshall Monday:
* Carriers across the U.S. (and internationally) are already offering a wide range of price and plan choices for the 5c/5s. We believe the actual choices consumers have for iPhone adoption (e.g. both upfront and monthly costs) are much more varied than can be captured by a single, unlocked ‘sticker’ price.
* Also on the subject of iPhone prices, Elmer-DeWitt sees the disparity between the U.S. and China opening an arbitrage for the new iPhones. For instance, the $549 unlocked iPhone 5c in the U.S. sells for 4,488 yuan ($731 US) in China.

* That 33 percent difference could go into anyone’s pocket able to find a way around China’s taxes.
* Indeed, in 2010 the New York Times recounted how residents of the Big Apple’s China Town would buy a no-contract iPhone 4 for $600, smuggle it into the mainland, where it sold for $750 to a gray market middleman.
* From there, the iPhone was marked up to $1,000 and sold to consumers.
