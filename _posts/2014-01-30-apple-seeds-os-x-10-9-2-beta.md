* Apple has seeded the fourth OS X 10.9.2 beta to registered Mac developers this evening. The release comes just one week after the third beta, suggesting Apple is honing in on a final version.
* The new build is available to registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what specific changes are coming in the update, or when it’ll be available to the public. But Apple has asked devs to focus on Mail, Messages, Graphics Drivers and VoiceOver.
* The first beta, released in December, added support for FaceTime Audio in Messages and FaceTime apps. Today’s build is labeled as 13C48, and we’ll be sure to let you know if it contains anything new.
