* Are you looking for a way to better organize the screenshots that you take with your iPhone? If so, then you should take AlbumShot for a spin.
* AlbumShot is a recently released jailbreak tweak that creates albums in the Photos app to store the screenshots that you take. But it doesn’t just create a single album; it creates an album for each app that you take a screenshot for. Watch our full video walkthrough for more details.
* Once you install AlbumShot, you can begin taking screenshots immediately. There are no settings or options to configure, so it’s a simple install and go process.
* After taking a screenshot, venture over to the Albums tab in the stock Photos app, and scroll to the bottom of the page to find your newly created app-specific album. All screenshots that you take of a particular app should be grouped in its own folder.
* While it’s true that AlbumShot might make organizing your screenshots easier, you’re bound to end up with a ton of different albums if you regularly take screenshots on your iPhone.
* AlbumShot is a free jailbreak tweak available right now on the BigBoss repo. What do you think about it?
