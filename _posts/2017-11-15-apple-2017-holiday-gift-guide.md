* Ahead of the holiday shopping season, Apple today refreshed its annual Holiday Gift Guide.
* Like in years past, the 2017 Holiday Gift Guide recommends various gifts Apple’s executives think you might like, ranging from devices such as iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and Apple TV 4K to third-party accessories like Sphero’s R2-D2 robotic droid, Belkin’s Boost Up Wireless Charging Pad, CliqueFie’s Selfie Stick and more.
* HomePod, which launches in December, is not on the list.
* Of course, Apple-branded accessories are being promoted as well: AirPods, Apple Pencil, Apple Watch bands, Beats Studio3 headphones, Apple’s silicone and leather folio cases for iPhone X and more. Additional products are available in dedicated sub-categories: More Gifts, What’s New, Gift Cards, Cases & Protection and Made by Apple.
* We highlighted some of the recommended third-party products, including the Apple Store-exclusive DJI Mavic Pro drone bundle and an iPhone-connected four-legged mechanical spider from Bristol Robotics that’s capable of carrying out augmented reality warfare.

* Apple states that customers in the United States will enjoy next-day delivery on any in-stock iPhone and free two-day delivery on almost anything else ordered before 5pm Monday through Friday (faster options are also available).
* Orders placed after 5pm Monday through Friday will be delivered within three business days. Orders placed on Friday before 5pm will be delivered by Tuesday while orders placed on Friday after 5pm or on Saturday or Sunday will get delivered by Wednesday.
* Check your virtual shopping bag to find out which items are in stock and see checkout for exact delivery dates. Two-day shipping and next-day shipping are not available on customized Mac and engraved products, as well as for orders paid for with financing or by bank transfer.
* Apple is expected to reveal its Black Friday deals on Friday, November 24, but you’ll get far better deals from the likes of Amazon, Best Buy and others. As an example, Apple last year treated Black Friday shoppers to an up to $150 Apple Store gift card with select purchases.
