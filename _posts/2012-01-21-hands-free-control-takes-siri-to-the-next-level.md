* The potential is startling. Once you play with Hands-Free Control in a true Siri environment on the iPhone 4S, it really hits you how much potential jailbreaking adds to Siri. Truly, the sky’s the limit here as far as voice recognition and the like are concerned.
* Imagine laying in bed with your iPhone half-way across the room. Problem: You forgot to set the alarm. Actually, no problem at all. With Hands-Free Control, Siri is always at your beckoning call…
* We’ve previously covered Hands-Free control, but that was prior to the iPhone 4S jailbreak, and hence, prior to it tightly integrating with Apple’s personal assistant. It’s much better now than it was then, and our imaginations are running wild with the possibilities.
* I know some people will be mostly concerned with battery life, but the developer of Hands-Free Control says it’s always listening in low-power consumption mode. For whatever it’s worth, I didn’t notice any outlandish battery usage in my hands-on time with the tweak, but your mileage may vary.
* If you want to give it a shot, and you have a jailbroken iPhone 4S, head over to Cydia and download it for $2.99. It also works with Spire, and Voice Control, but it’s certainly not as good as a native Siri on the 4S.
* Check out the video, and let us know what you think.
