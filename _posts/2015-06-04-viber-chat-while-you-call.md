* Viber, the popular VoIP and messaging platform owned by Japan’s Rakuten, hasn’t updated its iPhone app in any meaningful way for a while now. And just when you thought they’ve neglected the iOS app for good, here comes a brand new release packing a few solid improvements.
* I’ve always hated Viber wouldn’t let me chat while on a VoIP or video call. This should be expected behavior as iPhones have always supported messaging during a cellular call.
* In latest Viber 5.4 for iPhone update it’s now possible to minimize a VoIP call and open any other screen within the app without interrupting your conversation.
* In addition to this in-app multitasking feature, Viber now lets you access call history for a contact directly in your chat with them. As mentioned before, adding contacts is a lot easier with Viber’s new QR code scanning feature.
* To get started, hit the More tab at the bottom, choose Add Contact and then tap the new QR Scanner option to scan a QR code on another person’s iPhone screen.
* To bring up your own contact details in the form of a QR code for others to scan, open the More screen and tap the QR code icon in the upper-right.

* Other changes in this release of Viber include support for iOS’s Dynamic Type feature and improved usability with a person’s name and photo shown even if they’re not saved in your contacts.
* And should you happen to use Viber groups, you can give them their own icon in order to better distinguish between multiple groups.
* Viber 5.4 for iPhone changelog:
* The 80.2-megabyte app requires an iPhone with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Viber is free in the App Store.
