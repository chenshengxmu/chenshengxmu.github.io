* Truphone announced today that its Apple SIM data plans for cellular iPads are now officially available in Ireland and Portugal following last week’s launch in Australia and the Netherlands.
* The service is also available in Hong Kong, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom, with an additional 31 countries to follow by the end of 2017.
* These plans let iPad owners instantly get online and stay connected via the Truphone network at home and while traveling in 40 countries without international roaming charges.
* Truphone is giving customers 100MB of data for free, with a try before you buy offer making it easy for customers to get 4G data directly on their iPad with no obligation to purchase.
* To sign up for the service, just tap Settings > Mobile Data > Set Up Mobile Data, select Truphone as your provider and choose a data bucket you need for a month. You can buy more data at any time with a valid Visa or MasterCard in 40 countries.
* Two new features are now available, too:
* Apple SIM is built into all cellular iPad Pro models and is compatible with the fifth-generation iPad, first-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, iPad mini 4 and iPad Air 2 cellular models.
