* Apple has tonight starting airing a new holiday-themed iPad commercial entitled “I’ll Be Home.” With Christmas now just a few days away, the Cupertino company is obviously hoping to snag a few last-minute shoppers. As usual, we’ve got the video embedded for you after the break…

* The ad not only highlights Apple’s popular tablet line, but it also shows off the benefit of FaceTime — especially during the holidays. Also worth noting is that, like Apple’s first iPad mini spot, tonight’s ad seems intent on proving that the smaller iPad is just as capable as its larger sibling.
* With its ultra-thin form factor and smaller, 7.9-inch display, the iPad mini made our holiday gift guide. Twice. And we’re not the only ones who like it, as DigiTimes reported yesterday that Apple has gone back to its suppliers and ordered an extra 2 million iPad minis to help meet demand.
* What did you think of the ad?
