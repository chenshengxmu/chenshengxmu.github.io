* Twitter plans to unveil its new video feature in the next few weeks, reports Recode, and apparently some of the past details shared were wrong. Instead of a 10 minute video limit for the Twitter Video service like previously believed, it will be closer to 20 seconds and actually have a lot of similarities to the six-second, Twitter-owned Vine.
* Recode says an update to Twitter’s app for iOS will allow users to upload video from their phone’s camera roll, and shoot and edit video directly. Twitter has been pretty mum on the video feature thus far, simply telling investors in November that a native video tool for regular users was in the works, but said only that it would launch in the “first half” of 2015.
* Twitter’s stock was up close to five percent in regular trading hours on Thursday, as investors reacted to Recode’s report.
* The new video service from Twitter is believed to increase engagement within the service, and in some ways, offer a little competition against Facebook and YouTube. A Twitter Video page leaked on the web last week, hinting at a hub where videos posted through Twitter (not on Twitter) will be curated. Presumably, users will also be able to upload videos on the web.
* Instead of just tweeting a URL to a video elsewhere, Twitter wants users to actually upload videos to its site to keep engagement and sell you products through advertisements.
* It’s interesting Twitter isn’t allowing YouTube videos within its Video service – it appears Twitter wants to have its own cache of content. The real struggle, and for this to take stream, will be luring away the big names from YouTube, if at all possible. Twitter needs a way for the big names to make money on Twitter Video, like they can through YouTube’s ad sharing services.
* Do you think this will be a flop like Twitter Music?
