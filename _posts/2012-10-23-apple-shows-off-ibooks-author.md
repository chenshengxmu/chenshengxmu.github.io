* Back in January of this year, Apple introduced a new tool for authors to import their content into iBooks called iBooks Author. The software allows writers to easily create interactive documents that can be read on the iPad.
* A few moments ago, Apple announced an update to the suite with some nice new features like multitouch widgets and new portrait templates. And authors, you’ll now be able to choose your own fonts…
* From the Mac App Store:
* “Available free on the Mac App Store, iBooks Author is an amazing new app that allows anyone to create beautiful Multi-Touch textbooks — and just about any other kind of book — for iPad. With galleries, video, interactive diagrams, 3D objects, and more, these books bring content to life in ways the printed page never could.”
* It doesn’t look like Apple has pushed the update to the Mac App Store yet, but when it does you’ll be able to download it by clicking here.
