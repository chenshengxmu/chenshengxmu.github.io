* Apple could unveil (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus limited edition models today, according to an internal Virgin Mobile memo obtained by Mac Rumors. This information has since been corroborated by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.
* The memo notes that both models will be available for pre-order, but it is unclear exactly when they will be available in store. If the past is any history, when Apple unveiled (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 models last year on March 21, these devices were available to purchase in store and online three days later, on March 24.
* The Virgin Mobile memo doesn’t make any mention of a potential (PRODUCT)RED iPhone X or even the gold iPhone X colorway rumor that recently made the rounds.
* (PRODUCT)RED iPhone models are a good way for Apple to re-ignite interest in iPhone in the middle of a refresh cycle. And of course, this is a great way for Apple to contribute to a great cause.
* Would you pick up a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone?
