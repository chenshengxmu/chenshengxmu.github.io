* For his part, Ive said his work with Newson “represents the value of thoughtful design.”
* He also added:
* It’s been a fantastic honor to curate this collection of objects with Marc for the auction at Sotheby’s. Each piece represents the value of thoughtful design. What we create for each other is not only a comment on our culture but of course in many ways defines it.
* PRODUCT (RED) is making a difference in the lives of millions of people and we’re humbled to make this contribution to such an important and worthy cause.

* Ive most recently put his design philosophy on display with Apple’s upcoming iOS 7.
* The new iPhone, iPad and iPod touch software is marked by a flat design which removes much of the skueomorphism of past iOS versions.
* Keep in mind that this isn’t Apple’s first foray into offering PRODUCT (RED) products. The company has wrapped the iPhone, iPad, as well as the iPod touch in red to celebrate the charity.
* Other charity offers included a $50,000 coffee with Apple CEO Tim Cook.
