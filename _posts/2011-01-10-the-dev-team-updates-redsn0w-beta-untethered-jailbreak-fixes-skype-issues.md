* Another day, another update from the hard workers on the Dev Team. Right after releasing RedSn0w 0.9.7b5, they’ve turned around and released RedSn0w 0.9.7b6. The good news about this latest beta is that it fixes the issues with Skype, which made the app crash as soon as you tried to open it.
* Now that the Bluetooth issues have been fixed, and Skype has been fixed, what’s next for The Dev Team’s untethered jailbreak solution for iOS 4.2.1? One of the things that they are surely concentrating on is providing better support for Windows users. As you may already be aware of, the majority of the beta releases have been geared towards OS X due to speed issues plaguing the Windows solution.
* The nice thing about this latest beta is that it doesn’t require a clean install if you’re already running beta 5; simply run the latest RedSn0w jailbreak on top of your current install, and it should work fine.
* It looks like the Dev Team is quickly stamping out all of the issues with RedSnow 0.9.7b, hopefully an official release won’t be too far behind. You can of course download RedSn0w 0.9.7b6 in our downloads section.
* Now that Skype is fixed, are you planning on going the untethered route?
