* The biggest change in the iSight camera found on the back of the iPhone 5 is not its sapphire lens cover, the new panorama mode, faster performance, better video stabilization or crisper photos stemming from enhanced post-processing capabilities provided by the heavily customized, Apple-designed A6 chip.
* It’s its markedly better performance in low-light situations. The difference between the iPhone 4S and 5 camera becomes readily apparent on photos taken under artificial light, poorly lit scenes or no light at all.
* By way of Engadget, we are now able to compare night shots taken on the iPhone 5 against those snapped up using Nokia’s newly introduced Lumia 920, Nokia 808 PureView device, HTC’s flagship One X and of course, Samsung’s Galaxy S III. Who do you think came on top?
* The crux?
* The iPhone was also a solid runner-up with this test — it didn’t perform as well in even dimmer light, as we experienced when capturing images from a dark rooftop late at night, but it did yield decent shots in the lab.
* Even so, the frame is underexposed, includes a heavy orange cast and the 100-percent view is heavily pixelated and noticeably soft.
* Deceptive advertising be damned, the Lumia 920 has the most even exposure of all five devices, even with a slight yellow cast appearing on dimly lit images.
* Here, a closeup of a photo taken with an iPhone 5.

* And this image was taken using a Lumia 920, Nokia’s flagship Windows Phone 8 device.

* HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III exhibit noticeably worse low-light image quality than both the iPhone 5 and Nokia devices.
* A 101MB ZIP archive containing high-res versions of test photos is available right here.
* Engadget mobile editor Myriam Joire put together this video clip highlighting the official results and noting some of the differences between the devices.
* Of course, the Nokia 808 PureView beats every other smartphone to the punch when it comes to low-light camera tests because the 808, which was released last year and runs on Symbian, has a whopping 41-megapixel sensor, meaning it has way more pixels to work with in low-light situations.
