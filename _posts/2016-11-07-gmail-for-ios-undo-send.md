* Google today pushed an update to Gmail for iOS, bringing out several new productivity-focused enhancements. Gmail 5.0.3 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, a free download from the App Store, has been overhauled to make navigation easier than before. More importantly, the refreshed mobile Gmail client packs in an Undo Send feature, improved search with spelling suggestions, a new swipe to archive or delete feature and more.
* In addition to a fresh new look, Gmail on mobile now features sleeker transitions and animations throughout the app. In Gmail 5.0.3 for iOS, the Undo Send feature that has been available in the desktop Gmail interface is now finally available on mobile devices.
* As the name suggests, Undo Send lets you prevent embarrassing mistakes by retracting accidental emails within a period of time defined in the appâ€™s settings.
