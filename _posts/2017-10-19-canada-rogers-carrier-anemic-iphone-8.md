* The CEO of Canada’s biggest wireless company told investors and shareholders on a conference call they’re seeing little demand for Apple’s iPhone 8, Reuters reported Thursday.
* “What we’re seeing is sort of anemic appetite for iPhone 8,” Rogers Communications CEO Joe Natale said in an quarterly earnings conference call. The executive added that customers appear more interested in premium features in the upcoming iPhone X.
* He went on to warn that the outlook for iPhone X “is not clear” at the moment due to the phone’s higher price and potential supply constraints.
* “The iPhone X price point is about 75 percent higher than iPhone 7. So it’s a very expensive device,” he was quoted as saying. “Inventory is a question mark in terms of what we will get.”
* An unnamed source told a Taiwanese publication this morning that Apple is planning to cut iPhone 8 production by nearly fifty percent in November and December in order to shift manufacturing capacity toward iPhone, which launches November 3.
* Apple’s shares were down 2.4 percent amid concerns about prospects for iPhone 8 sales.
