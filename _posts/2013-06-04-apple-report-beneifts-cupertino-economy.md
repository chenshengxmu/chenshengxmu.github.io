* Apple Tuesday released an 80-page report detailing the economic benefits of Apple’s current headquarters. Along the way, the iPhone maker hopes a peek at the potential flood of cash headed toward local government coffers will help gain city approval of its upcoming iSpaceship campus.
* Among the highlights: Apple maintains a local payroll of $159 million for 16,000 employees, making it the largest sole employer in Cupertino. Creation of Apple’s Campus 2 (aka iSpaceship) would create 7,400 “new high-quality jobs.” And, new campus construction will add 9,200 full-time construction jobs to the local economy over a three-year period, the report adds…
* The report is titled ‘Economic and Fiscal Impacts Generated by Apple in Cupertino – Current Facilities and Apple Campus 2.’ The table below is pretty self-explanatory.

* Among the more interesting points made in the document is the impact Apple employees have on local spending and the company’s sizable impact on the Cupertino tax base.

* The city also could directly benefit from Apple’s expansion, including increased tax payments and departmental assistance:
* The report emphasizing the tax advantages of allowing the new campus to be built follows Apple CEO Tim Cook’s testimony last week before a Senate subcommittee.
* Apple: Cupertino-based employees $2B salary in 2012. On completion of $AAPL Campus 2, base salary will exceed $2.9B @cnbc

* Cook responded to critics of the company’s tax avoidance strategies by claiming Apple paid all taxes owed (France disagrees).
