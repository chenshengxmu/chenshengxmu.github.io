* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the most reliable Apple analyst out there, wrote in a note to clients Monday that Apple’s 2016 iPhone—call it an ‘iPhone 7’ if you will—will be even thinner than the current iPhone 6.
* According to the report, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider, the iPhone 7 should be just as thin as the recently released sixth-generation iPod touch and roughly in line with the iPad Air 2.
* Here’s a quick look at the thickness of current-generation iOS device:
* The iPhone 7 should have a thickness of somewhere between 6.0mm and 6.5mm, as per Kuo. Assuming he’s right, Apple is likely to outfit the iPhone 7 with a display featuring in-cell assembly process found on all iPhones from the iPhone 5 onward, which fuses touchscreen sensors into the LCD itself.
* That would be in contrast to speculative supply chain reports which have suggested that 2016 iPhones will switch back to using the glass-on-glass panel technology that Apple was using on the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4.

* Glass-on-glass substrates are thinner than in-cell displays, which eliminate a layer. On the other hand, glass-on-glass panels could potentially allow for bezel-free iPhones with ultra high-resolution screens and better multitouch performance at screen edges.
* Still, next year’s iPhones won’t have a display featuring a resolution of 4K or higher. While Apple would like to switch to glass-on-glass technology for Force Touch sensing, such a move likely won’t happen for a few years.
* Kuo also claims that the iPhone 7 will have a similar Force Touch technology like the upcoming iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus refresh because Apple and its suppliers are understood to have heavily invested in the technology.
