* In an effort to drive support from businesses, Apple has updated the Apple Pay section of its website with a link to a new Apple Pay supplies website. The website, aimed at businesses and merchants, provides an Apple Pay decal that can be displayed on a storefront window. 
* Apple is providing the kits at no cost to merchants, after a company, name, email address, and shipping address are entered. Included are glass decals in two sizes, register decals in two sizes, and an application tool. Businesses can order up to five kits using the online form, however larger decal orders require placing a phone call to an (800) number.
* Apple has been working to drum up support from businesses since the mobile payment service launched in October. At its recent media event, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that there are now more than 700,000 locations where Apple Pay is accepted, including vending machines.
* Now there are stickers to match.
