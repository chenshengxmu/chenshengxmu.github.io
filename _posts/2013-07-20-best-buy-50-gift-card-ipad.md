* Folks in the market for a new tablet will want to check out their local Best Buy this weekend. The retail giant has a limited-time promotion going on right now that gives customers a free gift card with the purchase of an iPad.
* Those purchasing a late-model iPad with Retina display, or an iPad 2, will get a $50 gift card, while those purchasing an iPad mini will get a $25 card. Offer is valid on all iPad models, 16GB through 128GB, Wi-Fi and Cellular…
* Best Buy sent us an email this morning, announcing the sale, and here’s how it works:
* “When you add an iPad® with Retina® display or iPad 2 to your cart, a $50 gift card will be automatically added as well. When you add an iPad mini to your cart, a $25 gift card will be automatically added.
* One free gift card per browser session. Gift card will ship separately and is not available for store pickup. Formatted capacity may vary.”
* The site doesn’t say that the offer is exclusive to online ordering, but it may be worth checking with Best Buy by phone before you make the trip. The promotion runs from 7/20/13 − 7/22/13, and of course iPad models vary by store.
* It’s worth noting here that Apple is widely expected to introduce a new iPad and iPad mini within the next few months. The 9.7-inch model is said to get lighter and thinner in a major redesign, and the mini could get a Retina display.
* But even if you’re not interested in picking up a new tablet, it may still be worth stopping by. In addition to the iPad sale, Best Buy is also knocking $200 off of select MacBook models as part of its ‘Back to School’ campaign.
