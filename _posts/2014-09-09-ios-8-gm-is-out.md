* As expected, Apple has seeded the GM (or Golden Master) version of iOS 8 to developers today, ahead of its public September 17th release. Registered developers can grab the new beta from either the online dev portal as a standalone download.
* We’re currently installing the firmware ourselves, and will be updating this post with any changes we find. We’re not expecting anything major with the final release so close, but if you notice any differences, be sure to email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a comment below (with screenshot).
* – Music app icon seems to have gotten a tint change
* – Hands on Clock app icon are noticeably darker
* – Tons of new wallpaper images
* – SMS relay is now called Text message Forwarding
* – New iCloud Backup icon
* – Voice Activation is now labeled ‘Hey Siri’
* – New Battery Life Suggestions in Settings
