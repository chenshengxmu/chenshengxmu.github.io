* Instagram is currently trialing a new privacy-focused feature with a small percentage of its users that would alert them via a notification when someone took a screenshot of their Story.
* WABetaInfo, which also discovered Instagram’s new text-only Type format for Stories, has managed to spot this handy new feature yesterday.
* As evidenced by the screenshot included top of post, the wording of the screenshot alert suggests that Instagram won’t notify the owner of the Story being screenshotted of your first offense, but will do so after your second strike.
* TUTORIAL: How to prevent Instagram from broadcasting your online status to friends
* Previously, Instagram supported notifications for screenshot of direct messages.
* This useful feature is currently being tested with select Instagram users ahead of a potentially wider rollout. The company may ultimately decide to scrap this capability altogether so watch this space as we’ll be making sure to keep you in the loop.
* Of course, you can already bypass this and watch Instagram stories anonymously and even save Instagram stories on your iPhone without anyone being alerted.
* In other Instagram news, the company is currently testing the ability to cross-post Stories to WhatsApp and has recently enabled a new Activity Status feature that broadcasts your online status to your followers and friends you’re messaging.
