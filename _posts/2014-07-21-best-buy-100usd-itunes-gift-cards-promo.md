* Best Buy, the Richfield, Minnesota headquartered American multinational consumer electronics retailer, is seemingly offering discounts on Apple products on a weekly basis. To boot your week, the company is now offering $100 iTunes Gift Cards for just $85, representing a saving of fifteen bucks on your software and digital media purchases on iTunes.
* These physical cards usually leave Best Buy’s warehouse in 1 business day and the retailer is throwing in free shipping to sweeten the deal a bit more…
* The offer is available here.
* You can redeem the card by using the Redeem feature in desktop iTunes or in the App Store on your iPhone or iPad. Just type in the code to get started. Alternatively, you can scan the code using your Mac’s or iOS device’s camera.
* Once the code is redeemed, your iTunes credit will reflect the amount on the card. You can use iTunes credit as you would a credit card to buy Mac and iOS apps, as well as music, movies, TV shows and more on iTunes.

* Note that iTunes will first use up your iTunes credit before reverting back to your other billing method. You can only redeem the card in the US App Store.
* Aside from this sale, Best Buy is offering iTunes Gift Cards in $15, $25, $50 denominations, but these have not been discounted.
