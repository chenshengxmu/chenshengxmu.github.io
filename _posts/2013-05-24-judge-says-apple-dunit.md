* By now, most of you have likely heard that Apple will be going to trial with the U.S. Justice Department next month. The iPad-maker is set to defend itself against charges that it conspired with book publishers to raise e-book prices.
* According to U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, it doesn’t look good. In a rather unusual pretrial move, the presiding Judge offered up her tentative view on the case. And she thinks it’s likely that the court will find Apple guilty…
* Reuters reports:
* “I believe that the government will be able to show at trial direct evidence that Apple knowingly participated in and facilitated a conspiracy to raise prices of e-books, and that the circumstantial evidence in this case, including the terms of the agreements, will confirm that,” Cote said.”
* Cote, who will be overseeing the case, expressed her views during a pretrial hearing yesterday. And while she was quick to point out that she had only looked through some of the evidence, her comments could put pressure on Apple to settle.
* The antitrust lawsuit, which the DoJ filed in a New York District court last April, originally included Apple and 5 publishers: Hachette SA, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster. But all of the publishers have taken deals.
* Obviously, Apple disagrees with Cote’s remarks. A lawyer for the company, Orin Snyder, said in a statement, “We strongly disagree with the court’s preliminary statements about the case today.” The Justice Department declined to comment.
* The trial is set to kickoff June 3rd, and will not feature a jury.
