* Apple today released a short film, shot entirely on iPhone X, to celebrate Chinese New Year.
* Directed by Peter Chan and titled “Three Minutes,” the video actually runs seven minutes and fifteen seconds long. The short film is apparently based on a true story. The Cupertino company released it this morning through its YouTube channel in Singapore.
* If you’re interested how they recorder and edited the movie, check out the accompanying behind the scenes section on Apple’s website in China.

* “If your family reunion only lasts three minutes, what will you do?”, asks the description.
* Apple bills the video as a unique Chinese New Year story, shot entirely on iPhone X. iPhone filmmaking has been picking up steam lately with recent news that Steven Soderbergh’s new film “Unsane” was shot entirely on iPhone X.

* Aside from improved sensors, iPhone X is capable of 4K video capture at a buttery-smooth 60 frames per second and Slo-mo capture in 1080p resolution at 120 or 240 frames per second.
