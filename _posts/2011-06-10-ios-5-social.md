* Here is a feature that had slipped under my radar but I just found out out about it on AllThingsD, even though I still had to dig around to figure out how to get it to work since the article didn’t mention how to get there.
* We already know from the WWDC keynote that iOS 5 is bringing deep Twitter integration. One of the many new features in iOS 5 is that you can add a Twitter handle to any contact. What Apple didn’t mention is that you can also add Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, and Myspace info to any contact…
* If like me you use Google Contacts, you will not see this option. However, if you go to your iCloud contacts, you will be able to add all the aforementioned services to your contacts.

* Now can we get Facebook integration as well, Apple? Please.
