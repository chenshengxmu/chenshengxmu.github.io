* Apple released a slew of developer betas on Wednesday, including iOS 9.3 and tvOS 9.2. This is the first 9.2 beta for tvOS, the operating system for the just-released, fourth-generation Apple TV.
* Developers can find the new tvOS beta, which is labeled build 13Y5179e, either over-the-air on an Apple TV set with the previous beta or as a standalone download via Apple’s developer portal here.
* Here are your release notes:
* tvOS 9.2 includes new features, bug fixes, and improvements in the OS and SDK. New features and enhancements include: – Bluetooth Keyboard support – Folders support for grouping apps on Home screen – MapKit support – Siri support for US Spanish (in US only) and French Canadian (in Canada only) – Siri support for UK English, Australian English and US English available across the UK, Australian and US Storefronts when English is set as the system language – Updated App Switcher UI
* As you can see the beta includes a handful of significant improvements, including support for Bluetooth keyboards, support for app folders on the Home screen, and an updated app switcher interface.
* We don’t know when tvOS 9.2 will hit public users, but given that this is just the first dev release, it’s likely several weeks out. We’re installing the beta now and will report back with other major changes.
* Update: it looks like 9.2 also adds the Podcast app.
