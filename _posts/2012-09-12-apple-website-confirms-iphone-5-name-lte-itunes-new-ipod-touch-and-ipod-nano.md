* Who would believe that Apple’s own website could be such a great source of information when it comes to finding out what we can expect from today’s event?
* As if there were any doubts that the new iPhone will indeed be called the “iPhone 5“, a quick search on Apple’s website gives us the confirmation we need…
* Unfortunately, the links return a 404 error for the time being but it’s safe to say that those pages will be live by the end of today’s event.
* But it doesn’t stop here. If you search for “LTE”, you’ll also be served a link to this page, which isn’t live either for the moment. A search for “iTunes 11” and “new iPod touch” returns similar results as well.
* Soon this won’t matter anymore as we’ll have the news told directly from Tim Cook. Stay tuned, we’ll be covering the event to the word!
