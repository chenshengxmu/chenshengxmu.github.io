* The Gevey SIM supports an unlock for the iPhone 4 on Apple’s latest firmware, iOS 4.3.4. Apple recently pushed the 4.3.4 update to combat the exploit uncovered by the jailbreak tool, JailbreakMe, in iOS 4.3.3.
* If you upgrade to iOS 4.3.4, you lose your untethered jailbreak. But the Gevey SIM still works…
* Redmond Pie notes that the reason the Gevey SIM and Gevey SIM Ultra remain functional in 4.3.4 is because Apple was probably rushed to fix the glaring PDF vulnerability that Comex uncovered in 4.3.3 with JailbreakMe. iOS 4.3.4 was released solely for the purpose of patching the untethered jailbreak, so blocking the Gevey SIM impostor probably never crossed Apple’s mind during the process of developing 4.3.4.
* The Gevey SIM technically still works in 4.3.4 because Apple didn’t update the iPhone 4’s baseband from 04.10.01.
* You can pick up a Gevey SIM card on Amazon or another online store. Follow all of the Gevey-specific news at the Gevey SIM unofficial blog. Also, be warned that the Gevey SIM isn’t exactly legal.
* If you’re still on iOS 4.3.3 and you’re interested in an unlock, check this out. Also, see our unlock page for more information about unlocking the iPhone.
* Who’s unlocked on iOS 4.3.4? Or has everyone stayed on 4.3.3?
