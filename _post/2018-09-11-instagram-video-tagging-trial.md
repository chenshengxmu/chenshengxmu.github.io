* Instagram has confirmed that it’s currently testing a new feature that would permit users to tag their friends in their video posts, not just in photos.
* “We’re always testing ways to improve the experience on Instagram and bring you closer to the people and things you love,” an Instagram spokesperson has confirmed to TechCrunch.
* Instagram has offered photo tagging since 2013, but users are currently unable to tag friends in their video posts. The feature currently being tested should put an end to that.
* It works similar to photo tagging, but with one exception: the small icon in a post’s bottom-left corner takes you to a “People in this Video” page listing all of the tagged people in the video post rather than have tagged names float on top of the video, which would be impractical.
* Anyone who hasn’t been opted in to this test by Instagram won’t be able to use video tagging until the company rolls it out to all users. Instagram didn’t share much information about launch timeframe but watch this space as your trusted iDownloadBlog will be making sure you’re kept in the loop.
