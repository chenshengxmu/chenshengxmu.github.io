* Pokémon Due, a mobile strategy board game from The Pokemon Company, today launched on App Store as a free download with non-compulsory In-App Purchases.
* In this iPhone and iPad title, you’re tasked with collecting as many Pokémon figures as you can to make the ultimate deck. You can then compete, in real time, in online duels with players from around the world for a chance to enter the top rankings in League Matches.
* Whoever gets one of their figures to an opponent’s goal wins.
* To beat the opponents, however, you must figure out when to attack an enemy and when to defend yourself. For instance, you can send your Pokémon along different routes in a rush to the goal or block an opponent’s Pokémon from advancing.
* Tip: try to knock out the opposing Pokémon or cause it to move out of your way.
* The turn-based concept requires you to think strategically as you and opponents take turns moving the figures on the board. In duel matches, your deck is composed of six figures, each with different abilities and a set number of steps it can take.
* “Set up a strategic formation and attack your opponent, or simply block their path—it’s all about tactics,” according to release notes. “Plan your strategy and defeat your opponents in this game of cat and mouse.”
* Here’s the promotional trailer for the game.
* The game’s artificial intelligence can be a reliable ally in determining good moves and taking your turn for you if you’re too lazy to put your gray matter to some good use.
* You can use plates at the start of each turn that have various effects, like swapping positions of a Pokémon in play and giving your Pokémon various enhancements for that turn. Battles are determined by attacks on each Pokémon’s data disk.
* Simply spin the disk to see which attack each Pokémon will use.
* If you’re unable to run this game on your iOS device, try changing regional settings to United States in Settings. “Certain devices and/or configurations may also cause the application to fail to work,” warns The Pokemon Company.
* The game does not appear to run on jailbroken devices.
* As mentioned, Pokémon Duel includes non-obligatory In-App Purchases in the form of gold coins that can be used for inventory and to advance your characters.
* The game requires iOS 8.0 or later.
* Visit the official website to learn more about Pokémon Duel.
* Grab Pokémon Duel for free from App Store.
