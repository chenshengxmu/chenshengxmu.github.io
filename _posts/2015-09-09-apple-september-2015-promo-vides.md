* In addition to refreshing product webpages on its website with detailed information about the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil, the new Apple TV and more, a batch of promotional clips providing an even closer look at the new products have surfaced on Apple’s YouTube channel.
* We’ve embedded all of them for your pleasure so give these videos a watch and join us for the discussion in the comment section.
* Here is a 50-second ‘Reveal’ video which teases the new iPhones’ 3D Touch feature.

* Next up is a more detailed video presentation, running four minutes long, of the new force-sensing screen and accompanying user interface shortcuts, which Apple confusingly calls 3D Touch on the new iPhones rather than Force Touch as on the Apple Watch and the new Mac notebooks.

* “With iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, we’re introducing an entirely new dimension of interaction,” reads the description “For the first time, iPhone recognizes force. 3D Touch is the next generation of Multi-Touch. It’s a clear example of how hardware and software designed together can create a singular experience.”
* The 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a Reveal footage of its own, here it is.
* And here is a Jony Ive-narrated video running three minutes and forty seconds long that highlights the powerful hardware of the new tablet while showing off some the things the device’s massive 12.9-inch display makes possible.
* “iPad has always offered a uniquely immersive experience,” says Apple.
* “Now, with its 12.9-inch Retina display, powerful A9X chip, and dynamic four speaker audio, iPad Pro lets you be more creative and more productive —at an entirely new scale.”
* Of course, the Apple Pencil deserves a separate video, too.
* “Apple Pencil is designed to look and feel like a familiar tool,” reads the description. “Yet with its meticulously engineered technology, working with our most advanced Multi-Touch display, it delivers an extraordinary new level of precision.”
* The new Apple TV with Siri voice navigation, universal search, a redesigned remote with a touchpad, downloadable games and apps and other features is quite compelling.

* “This is the future of television — the best content delivered to you through apps like WatchESPN, HBO NOW, Netflix, and Hulu. And the new Apple TV makes it all a great experience with the Siri Remote with Touch surface, a new interface, and the App Store,” says Apple.
* Here are your new Apple Watch Sport finishes and additional bands.

* “Apple Watch was designed to enable millions of unique designs,” the video raves.
* “Now, with new colors, new materials and advanced capabilities, the experience gets even more personal.”
* Over the many years Apple has really perfected the art of making compelling and polished product videos and checking them out is never a waste of time—especially if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t read long articles.
