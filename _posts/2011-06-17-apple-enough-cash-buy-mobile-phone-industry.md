* In a mouth-dropping report, Asymco states that Apple would be able to buy the entire mobile phone industry – in cash.
* Nokia, RIM, HTC, LG, Motorola and Sony Ericsson could all be bought with Apple’s treasure trove of $70 billion in available funds. Apple’s profits are expected to continue in growth, while most handset makers are suffering from a decline in profits.

* These numbers exclude Samsung, who is valued at $53 billion and is currently in a heated series of lawsuits with Apple. Asymco is optimistic about Apple’s cash holdings in the future, and there may very well come a day when even Samsung’s $53 billion doesn’t put a dent in Apple’s stockpile.
* The previous mobile phone heavyweight, Nokia, has experienced an intense drop in profit since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Nokia has gone from $3.5 billion in profits per quarter to $1.3 billion and less.
* “Given the current valuations, it would not be difficult for Apple to acquire every phone vendor except for Samsung with cash alone.
* The more remarkable thing is that as market values of phone vendors continue to decline, Apple’s cash will continue to grow dramatically. Indeed, a time may soon come when Apple’s cash will be worth more than the entire phone industry.”
* Apple has continued to experience incredible business growth year after year, thanks to the success of its retail stores and iPhone/iPad sales worldwide. Kudos, Apple.
