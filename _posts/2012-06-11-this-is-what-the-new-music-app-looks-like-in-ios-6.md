* The iTunes and App Store apps aren’t the only one to get a make over with the introduction of iOS 6. Next on the list is the Music app, which was in serious need of a redesign as well. Not that it was bad, but after 5 years, it just gets old.
* The Music app now has a slick grey skin and the music player a black skin that could make jailbreak themers jealous. More screenshots below…
