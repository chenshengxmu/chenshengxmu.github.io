* Twitterrific developer The Iconfactory last evening announced immediate availability of Twitterrific for Apple Watch.
* The company’s freemium Twitter client for the iPhone and iPad was refreshed on the App Store with all-new Apple Watch functionality in the form of Glances, Notifications and the recent activity view. Twitterrific’s Glances put retweets, favorites and new followers you’ve received over the past 24 hours, in addition to the current unread tweet count, right on your wrist.
* But don’t you worry, you’ll be able to fine-tune which Twitter notifications appear on your Watch so you don’t get inundated with unwanted alerts. Interestingly enough, The Iconfactory has opted for an unusual route of by requiring you to upgrade to Twitterrific’s push notifications via a one-time $1.99 In-App Purchase in order to unlock the full Apple Watch functionality.
* Those who have previously upgraded to Twitterrific’s push notification feature can start using the whole range of Apple Watch features from the get-go.
* The Watch app consists of three parts: the Glance view, Recent Activity and Notifications. As I mentioned, you get a list of your most recent 25 replies, mentions, direct messages, favorites, retweets and new followers.
* Tapping any item in the list shows its details, letting you respond by favoriting a reply or mention, giving a new friend a follow back and replying to mentions and direct messages using the Watch’s dictation feature.

* Using Force Touch from the activity screen lets you compose a new tweet or refresh the list of recent items. And with Handoff support, you can easily continue composing a new tweet with dictation or viewing a user profile, on your iPhone.
* “Simply dictate your tweet, then look for Twitterrific’s icon on your iPhone or iPad’s lock screen,” developers explain. “Unlock your device with the icon and Twitterrific opens directly to the compose screen with your new tweet ready for editing or posting.”
* Finally, several notification types are available in the Watch app to keep track of who’s following you, retweeting or favoriting your tweets and more. Depending on the notification type, you can even take action without pulling an iPhone out of your pocket.
* On the iOS side, this update enables the ability to check out favorite and retweet counts for selected tweets.
* Twitterrific 5.11 changelog:
* New features:
* Glance View
* Improvements:
* Bug fixes:
* The 7.3-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later.
* Earlier this month, Twitterrific gained support for drafts, as well as better muffling and muting and other enhancements. As mentioned before, the app is provided on a freemium basis, with advanced functionality locked behind In-App Purchases.
* Again, the $1.99 Push Notifications upgrade is required to take advantage of Twitterrific’s advanced Watch functionality. Other In-App Purchases are available, including ones to remove in-app advertising, turn on tweet translation or remove all restrictions in exchange for a one-time $3.99 In-App Purchase.
* Grab Twitterrific free in the App Store.
