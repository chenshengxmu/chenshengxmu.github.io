* iOS 5 Beta 7 will expire on October 20, 2011. As usual, jailbreak hacker iH8Sn0w has dug deep into Apple’s latest beta build to determine when it will expire. iOS 5 Beta 6 is set to expire on September 29.
* In case you didn’t know, Apple released iOS 5 Beta 7 to developers yesterday. 
* iOS 5 Beta 7 can also be jailbroken with RedSn0w. It’s expected that Apple will hold it’s next event in late September or early October. We expect Apple to release the final GM build of iOS  soon, but don’t expect it for another few weeks. Apple releases a GM version of iOS when the software is in the final testing stages.
* Make sure to let us know if you find anything interesting in iOS 5 Beta 7.
