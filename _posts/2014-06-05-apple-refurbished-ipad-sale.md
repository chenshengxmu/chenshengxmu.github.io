* The deals start with the first generation iPad mini (16GB, Wi-Fi only), which has been discounted down to $219, and go all the way up to the iPad Air. You can get a refurbished 64GB Air, with built-in cellular support, for $699…

* For those who aren’t familiar with Apple’s refurbished products, these aren’t your typical remanufactured goods. Apple tests and certifies all of its refurbished devices, and includes a new battery, outer shell and full 1-year warranty.
* If you see something you like, you better act fast, as inventory is very limited. If you can wait, remember that Apple is expected to unveil new iPad models this fall, so that plus the holiday season should bring about some decent discounts.
