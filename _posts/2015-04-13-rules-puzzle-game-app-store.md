* Those of you who enjoy app deals may be interested to know that Rules! has gone free for a limited time. Apple is currently offering promo codes for the popular brain-teasing puzzler, which typically costs $2.99, within its Apple Store app.
* For those who haven’t played it before, Rules! is a well-designed puzzle game that puts your memory and reflex skills to the test. Players are presented with a 16-card board, and asked to remove cards based on increasingly difficult guidelines.
* Apple describes the app:
* Rules! is a fiendishly trick puzzler that’ll test your memory and your reflexes. To clear each set of colorful tiles, you’ll need to follow specific rule in order before the click runs out. Rules! will work on your new Apple Watch too.
* And here are some screenshots:

* To grab your free copy, simply launch the Apple Store app (not to be confused with App Store), navigate to the ‘Stores’ tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page. If you see the ‘Start something new’ image, you may try swiping to the right.
* Note that these steps may differ a bit on iPad, and I’m not sure exactly which countries this promotion is available for outside of the United States. But Rules! is a very well done game, especially for free, so it’s definitely worth looking into.
