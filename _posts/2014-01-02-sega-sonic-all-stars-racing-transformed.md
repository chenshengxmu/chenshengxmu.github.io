* Rather unexpectedly and with little fanfare, games maker Sega has released a brand new title on the App Store. Called Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, the game is actually the official iOS port of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for consoles and part of its 2013 winter release schedule.
* If you’ve played Mario-like kart racing games such as Rovio’s Angry Birds Go!, you should feel right at home in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. A pared down version of Transformed on consoles, the game sports a brand new World Tour mode designed specifically for mobile, with multiplayer both locally and online for up to four players…
* From iTunes release notes:
* Race as Sonic and a host of legendary All-Stars and prepare to transform! Speed across land, sea and air in a high velocity battle to the finish line, as your amazing transformable vehicle changes from car to boat to plane mid-race. Racing on mobile will never be the same again!
* Check out the trailer.
* Isn’t it funny seeing Sonic driving when in fact he can outrun any vehicle with ease?
* Just saying…
* Tracks are pretty dynamic: you’ll discover alternate routes, with courses themselves changing throughout the race.

* Features include support for iOS 7 physical controllers, daily and weekly challenges, online/local multiplayer challenges for up to four players, Facebook integration for your friends’s profile pics on the track and more.
* The initial version includes ten legendary Sega characters, each with their own unique transformable vehicle, but more are “coming soon” by way of content updates.
* Download Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for $4.99 from the App Store.
* The 1.03GB download is universal so all your form-factor devices are supported natively, as long as they’re compatible with iOS 7 or later.
* Back in December, Sega released a remastered Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for iOS and put some of its Sonic games up for a time-limited sale.
