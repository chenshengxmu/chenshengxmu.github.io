* As we explained in one of our HomePod tips articles, you must use Apple’s stock Home app on an iPhone or iPad to update the operating system on your HomePod wireless speaker.
* By default, HomePod will automatically install a new firmware as it becomes available.
* Thankfully, Apple gave us some much-needed options and one of them lets you turn automatic updates off if you prefer to manually check for new HomePod software.
* To stop your HomePod from automatically downloading and installing new software updates:
* 1) Open the Home app on your iOS device with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 2) Tap the arrow icon in the upper-left corner.
* 3) Select the option labeled Software Update.
* TIP: If you have multiple HomeKit-compliant homes set up in the Home app, choose the option Home Settings after tapping the arrow icon, then select a home to check for updates.
* 4) Slide the switch Install Updates Automatically to the OFF position.

* Going forward, you will need to manually check for HomePod updates by visiting this screen.
* If there’s an update available for your HomePod, it will appear there. Just tap Install and follow the onscreen instructions to apply the new firmware to your smart speaker.
* And that’s all there’s to it, folks!

* I wholeheartedly recommend changing automatic update settings for your HomePod and developing a habit of checking for new software updates manually. It is always a good idea to wait a few days before installing new software on your Apple device as to avoid any potentially major installation issue that might have slipped though the cracks.

* This is especially important on HomePod which lacks a screen: you don’t want it to automatically install a brand new firmware before you’ve had the chance to read the changelog and websites like iDB to see if there are any major hiccups with the update.
* TUTORIAL: How to update the software on your HomePod
* Lastly, the Home app installs HomePod software updates to all of the speakers you have set up in your home at once, which is another reason to turn off the auto-update option.
