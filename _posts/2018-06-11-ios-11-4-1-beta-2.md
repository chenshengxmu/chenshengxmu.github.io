* Apple has released the second betas of iOS 11.4.1, macOS 10.13.6 and tvOS 11.4.1. Registered developers can download the new betas through Apple’s developer center, or they can be installed using each platform’s respective OTA mechanism.
* Today’s seeds come amidst growing excitement over iOS 12 and the other major OS updates Apple announced last week, which are also in beta. These updates are modest by comparison, containing only bug fixes and other minor improvements.
* Nevertheless, we are installing the new software and will be sure to report back with any notable changes or major findings. And as usual, if you see something worth mentioning that you think we missed, be sure to let us know in the comments.
