* After 10 months of production issues and excuses, it appears that the white iPhone 4 may finally materialize. Engadget and several other media outlets have reported that wireless carrier Three UK has posted the white iPhone 4 on their website.
* It wasn’t just a place-holder either, a ‘buy now’ option with an earliest delivery date of April 20th was available. Although the white iPhone has made website appearances before, there hasn’t been an option to order it…
* iDB has shared numerous rumors regarding the white iPhone 4 in the last few weeks, but nothing seems to be as concrete as this. The story broke earlier today when Recombu posted a tweet by Three affiliate, Adam Kirby, about the white iPhone 4 order page.
* You can check out the original link here, but it seems as if the order page has been taken down. Browsing the Three website will get you to the iPhone 4 page, but when you try to select the white model you get the usual ‘unavailable’ message.
* Folks over at Engadget claimed that they were able to get all the way to an order confirmation page for the white iPhone. They also posted this chat script with a Three online customer service agent:

* The general consensus seems to be that this was a test page that was never supposed to be seen by the general public. However, this does provide hard evidence that a white iPhone 4 release is getting very close. I wonder if there will be any kind of incentive or subsidy for current iPhone 4 owners in contract.
* What do you think?
