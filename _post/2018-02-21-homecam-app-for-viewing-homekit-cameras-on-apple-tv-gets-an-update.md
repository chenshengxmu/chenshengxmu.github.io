* Homecam so far has been the only app that allows you to view multiple HomeKit camera live streams at once. Today, it got a major update on the Apple TV with many new features.

* We’ve had the chance to test out the latest update for the past couple weeks, and it by far is the best way to view your HomeKit cameras.
* It is super useful on the iPhone to view your feeds at once, but I think my favorite feature is the ability to add it to your widget view.
* I love being able to swipe to the left and see a live feed of my cameras instantly there.
* This has been a huge benefit to quickly check my cameras on my phone.
* The Apple TV got some major changes in the most recent update of Homecam.
* In the app, you can view all your camera feeds, and when viewing full screen, a simple tap on the sides of the Siri remote will animate between them.

* If you swipe down from the top, you can now auto cycle between the different feeds. You can choose the specific feeds you’d like to rotate through, and the speed in which they do. This is a great way to use the Apple TV as a security monitor for your home.
* Data overlays are present, which will show different pieces of environmental information over the video feed. This works if you have a sensor, such as the Netatmo Healthy Home Coach, Eve Room, or Eve Degree in the same room as your camera. Unfortunately, in my testing, I wasn’t able to get this to work. To be fair, I am testing a pre-release version of tvOS and that may have something to do with it.

* Lastly, and probably my favorite feature, is the ability to control your HomeKit accessories right from the camera feed. As an example, say you are watching your patio, you think you see something and want to turn the lights on. You can click and hold in the middle of your Siri remote and a modal will appear with all of the rooms accessories.
* It works with any accessories in each of those rooms like lights, thermostats, etc.
* The update is live now, so go ahead and grab it from the App Store.
* The app is available as a universal app for iPhone and Apple TV for $4.99. It isn’t the cheapest app, but I’ve found it to be really worth it.
