* Apple just took the wraps off of its long rumored, 12.9-inch iPad Pr. As expected, the device is incredibly powerful and features two unique (and sold-separately) accessories: a smart keyboard cover and a pressure-sensative stylus it’s calling the Apple Pencil.
* For those wondering when you’ll be able to grab one of the new iPads, and how much it’s going to cost you, Apple just announced that the tablet will be available in November, with a starting price of $799 for the entry-level model, which features 32GB of storage.

* As you can see in the slide above, there will be 3 models of the iPad Pro: the aforementioned 32GB at $799, 128GB model at $949 and a $128GB model with Wi-Fi + Cellular for $1079. It’s a little bit different, but we should have more details as we get closer to launch.
* For those interested in the accessories, the Apple Pencil will cost $99 and the Smart Keyboard will be $169.
