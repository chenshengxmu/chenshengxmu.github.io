* If you send an enormous amount of text messages (iMessages included) to your contacts, then a new free jailbreak tweak called CountMyMessages by iOS developer Kiran Patil may be of interest to you.
* Just as the name implies, this tweak provides you with a way of monitoring the total number of messages you’ve sent or received from within the stock Messages app.
* In the screenshot example above, you can see how CountMyMessages replaces the title banner at the top of the Messages app with statistics. In this display, T stands for Total, S stands for Sent, and R stands for Received.
* Furthermore, you can narrow your statistics to specific conversations by visiting the details view for that conversation (tap in the “i” button at the top right of the Messages app to access it). This way, you can see how much activity you have with a specific person rather than in general:

* Admittedly, this information isn’t pertinent for everybody, but it may be useful to someone who wants to keep closer tabs on the number of messages they’re sending and receiving each month, especially if you have monthly messaging caps imposed on you.
* If you’re interested in trying CountMyMessages, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is only intended for jailbroken iOS 11 devices and doesn’t come with any options to configure.
* Do you like the idea of seeing live messaging statistics inside of the Messages app? Share in the comments section below.
