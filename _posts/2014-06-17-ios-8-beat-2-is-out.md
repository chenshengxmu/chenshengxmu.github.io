* Two weeks after releasing the first beta of iOS 8, Apple today seeded it developers with the second beta of both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.
* The Yosemite Developer Preview 2 (Build 14A261i) for Macs and a pre-release version of iOS 8 Beta 2 (build 12A4297e) for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices are available for download through Apple’s Dev Center.
* The betas are available standalone or as over-the-air downloads via the Software Update mechanism…
* As speculated, iOS 8 Beta 2 can now be downloaded through the Software Update section of the stock Settings app. The second beta of OS X 10.10 Yosemite is available to download from Dev Center, weighing in at 1.16 gigabytes, or as a Mac App Store update.

* Likewise, the Apple TV set-top box has received a new beta firmware that brings iCloud Family Sharing to the big screen and allows developers to test new AirPlay features with their apps.
* Interestingly, the 2010 Apple TV hardware is not supported. Finally, Xcode 6 Beta 2 (build 6A216f) with the included iOS 8 SDK Beta 2 and OS X 10.10 SDK can be found in Dev Center as well.
* iOS 8 Beta 2 highlights:
* The new iCloud Photos splash page and related options in iCloud settings.

* We continue to investigate the new betas and will update this article with any additional findings in terms of new features, enhancements and under-the-hood changes.
* Note that even though Apple cautions that devices updated to iOS 8 Beta 2 can’t be restored to earlier versions of iOS, our own Joe Rossignol showed you how to downgrade from iOS 8 Beta 1 to iOS 7.1.1.
