* TMZ, a celebrity news site, just posted a set of nice photos depicting actor Ashton Kutcher dressed in Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs’ classic attire.
* The image was allegedly taken as Kutcher was making his way to the set of an upcoming independently produced biopic aptly named Jobs: Get Inspired.
* The flick is not to be confused with Sony’s biopic entitled Steve Jobs: The Movie, based on Walter Isaacson’s authorized bio book.
* Here, have a look at Kutcher channeling Jobs and tell us what you think…
* According to TMZ, paparazzi-style photos were snapped as Kutcher was making his way to the set in Los Angeles on Friday.
* Kutcher can be seen clad in Jobs’ trademark blue jeans, a black turtleneck sweater and New Balance running shoes. He also got long hair and a beard right.
* Kutcher’s physique on the photographs does appear to resemble Apple’s late honcho in the early days, down to his forwardly leaned walking posture.
* Kutcher appears to be really getting into character, though it’s too early to tell until we see some footage. Besides, Jobs was a complicated man so it’ll be interesting seeing whether Kutcher, 34, has the mojo to channel Jobs, but in a believable and dignified manner.

* As you know, Ashton Kutcher is best known for his comedic roles. That’s why some folks fear he is a bad choice to portray a very important person like Steve Jobs.
* The actor is also an investor in various Silicon Valley startups.
* Jon Cryer will apparently play Steve Wozniak in Jobs: Get Inspired. The movie will cover the early years of the Apple founder’s life from 1971 until 2000.
* Principal photography began in May and the project is said to wrap up in time for a fourth-quarter release.
* Regardless of your feelings about Kutcher, would you say he looks the spitting image of a young Steve Jobs?
* Is this movie gonna tank?
