* Unicode 11 is coming in 2018 and the Unicode Consortium’s president Mark Davis yesterday announced that a total of 67 new emoji characters have been declared as draft candidates for potential inclusion in a release some time next year.
* The proposed emoticons include:
* The list of the new emoji characters and their designs is subject to change. The full proposed draft is available on the Unicode Consortium website.
* The final candidate list should be released in the next few months.

* Fire Extinguisher and Test Tube remain on the list.
* As noted by Emojipedia, the Unicode Consortium will first have to determine which of the 67 newly proposed emojis will be making the cut during a meeting in the fourth quarter.
* The organization will hold another meeting in the first quarter of 2018 to name the new characters. Apple should roll out these new emoji sets across its software platforms within a few weeks or months following the official release of Unicode 11.

* Last month, the consortium released 56 new emoji characters, including dumpling, sandwich, chopsticks, pretzel, orange heart, elf, fairy, mage, exploding head, vomitting face and others.
* Apple should adopt these new Unicode 10 emojis as part of minor software updates to iOS 11, macOS High Sierra and watchOS 4 later this fall.
