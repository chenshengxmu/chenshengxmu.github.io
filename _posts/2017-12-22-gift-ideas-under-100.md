* Time is running out! For those still struggling to find last-minute gifts, we’ve put together a roundup of 10 great ideas that won’t break the bank.

* A good Bluetooth speaker always makes for a great gift, and the UE Boom 2 is the best you can get for under $100. That’s because it’s usually twice that expensive, but it’s on sale for the holidays. Features include incredible 360-degree sound, 15+ hours of playback, waterproof and shock proof, NFC quick-pairing, and more.

* For a smarter, but less portable speaker, we really like the new Amazon Echo. The second generation of this Alexa-enabled speaker features a better-looking design and improved sound quality, courtesy of Dolby. At worst, they’ll use this to stream music like any ordinary Bluetooth speaker. At best, it’ll change their life.

* Give them the gift of endless entertainment. The Roku Ultra connects you to over 2,500+ streaming channels that offer movies, TV shows, music, sports, news, international and kids programming, and much more. It supports 4K and streaming and comes with a smart remote that can connect to headphones for private, wireless listening.

* Speaking of headphones, everyone can use a solid pair or backup pair of wireless headphones. They should be durable, comfortable, connect easily, and most importantly, sound good. The BeatsX check off all of these boxes, and since they normally run $150, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better pair for under $100.

* Whether they’re a gadget-lover or not, a multitool can make for a great gift. It’s like giving them a full tool box, with pliers, screwdrivers, wire-cutters, scissors, can opener, and more. Most folks agree that the Wave from Leatherman is the best multitool in this price range—it comes with a sheath and a 25-year warranty.

* No one has ever complained about having “too much” storage, so if you’re having trouble thinking of a gift, consider this 4TB portable hard drive from Western Digital. It looks great, supports USB 3.0 for fast data transfers, it works with both Mac and Windows operating systems, and it comes highly recommended.

* If the person you’re shopping for has an older tablet, or doesn’t have one at all, I’m not sure there’s a better gift you could get them in this price range than the Fire HD 8 from Amazon. With its vibrant 8-inch display and fast quad-core processor, it’s built to handle anything from games to email, e-books and much more.

* For the uninitiated, sous vide cooking is a super simple process that produces restaurant quality results. Just attach this cooker to any pot, add water, drop in your ingredients in a sealed bag (or glass jar), and press start. Bluetooth connectivity enables you to start, stop and monitor your cooking from your mobile device.

* For the person who seemingly has everything, consider the BookBook CaddySack from Twelve South. It’s essentially a travel tote for all of your plugs, cables and other knickknacks. Like the rest of the BookBook line, the outside looks like a beautiful leather-bound book, and the inside is extremely functional.

* Give the gift of peace of mind. This Blink Home Security Camera System includes a single HD Blink Camera, sync module and mounting kit. The whole thing is completely wireless and a breeze to set up. Other features include built-in motion detection, live view mode, instant alerts, low-light vision and cloud storage.
