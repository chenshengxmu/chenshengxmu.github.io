* It can sometimes be difficult to get all your different platforms to play along nicely, especially when they’re all competing against each other to try to be the better one.
* Fortunately, when it comes to the Calendars app, there is a way to export your calendar events to Google Calendar so you can still see all of your important upcoming events from your Google account on any of your devices.
* In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to export calendar events from your Calendar app to Google Calendar.
* You might want to do this for a number of reasons, including any of the following:
* No matter whether you’re on a Mac or an iOS device, exporting your Calendar app events to Google Calendar is possible. The process is definitely a whole lot easier to do from a Mac, but we’ll be showing you both methods in this tutorial for your convenience.
* The easiest way to import your Calendar app events to Google Calendar isn’t from your iOS device, but rather from your Mac. To do that, you’ll need to create an ICS file and import it into Google Calendar. Here are the steps to make this happen:
* 1) Open the Calendar app on your Mac.
* 2) From the Menu Bar, click on File > Export > Export…

* Now that you’ve imported your Mac’s Calendar app as an ICS file into Google Calendar, your ICS file events should appear in your Google Calendar web app.
* But… let’s say you don’t have a Mac; doing this from an iOS device is a bit more complicated.
* If you don’t have access to Mac, the process is a little bit more cumbersome. Nevertheless, we’ll walk you through the steps.
* The first step in exporting any of your Calendar events from iOS to Google Calendar is making sure that you are signed into your Google account on your iOS device. This is a pretty simple thing to do, and if you’ve ever added a new email account to your device before, then you’ve probably already done this before.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to the Mail, Contacts, Calendars preferences pane.

* 2) Next, tap on the Add Account cell to begin adding your Google account.
* 3) Tap on Google from the list of email account providers.
* 4) Sign in with your Google account credentials to finish signing in to your Google account on your iOS device.

* Once you’re all signed in, you can give yourself a pat on the back, because you’ve completed the first baby step in syncing your iOS calendar with Google Calendar.
* After you’ve confirmed that you’re signed in, you will need to ensure that iOS is giving Google permission to access your iOS calendar. To do that, you’ll follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app and open the Mail, Contacts, Calendars preferences pane.

* 2) From your list of accounts, tap on the Gmail account you want to transfer iOS calendars to.
* 3) Next, make sure that the Calendars toggle switch is turned on in the Gmail account settings. If it already is, then you’re ready to move on.
* Once you’ve enabled your Google account to access your iOS Calendar as outlined above, you’re ready to move on. You can now transfer any event on your iOS Calendar to your Google Calendar.
* To do that, you’ll follow these steps for each and every event that you want to move over to Google Calendar:
* 1) Launch the Calendar app from your Home screen and find a date with an event you want to transfer to Google Calendar.

* 2) Tap on the date in the Calendar view, and then tap on the event itself.
* 3) Once you’re looking at the lone event in the event viewer, tap on the Edit button at the top left of the interface:

* 4) Now, tap on the cell labeled Calendar.
* 5) Next, you will be able to choose a new place to display the Calendar event; you’ll pick your Gmail account instead of Calendar.
* 6) Once selected, ensure that your Calendar app settings point to your Gmail account, and then tap on the Done button to save your changes.

* And now you’ve just transferred that event to Google Calendar. You can confirm that you’ve done it right by signing into Google Calendar on your computer’s web browser and checking the date that you added the event to. In our case, you can see that our event was added to the proper date in Google Calendar:

* That’s all there is to it!
* The events that you add to Google Calendar in this way are going to remain in the iOS Calendar app despite adding them to the competing Calendar service, so this means you’re still free to use your iPhone to view events from the iOS Calendar app.
* Whenever you might have the need to import your Mac or iOS device’s Calendar app events from an Apple device to Google Calendars, where there’s a will there’s a way. Now you can keep all of your platforms up to date with one another.
