* With less than 24 hours until tomorrow’s official iPhone 5 launch at 8am, Apple issued a note to its registered iOS developers, asking them to upload taller screenshots to comply with iPhone 5 requirements.
* This concerns only developers updating apps for the iPhone 5 and the fifth-generation iPod touch, which both feature a taller 1136-by-640 pixel Retina display. The new screenshots dimensions are…
* …per Apple, there are four new screenshot dimensions, two for portrait and two for landscape:
* – 640 x 1136 (portrait) – 640 x 1096 (portrait) – 1136 x 640 (landscape) – 1136 x 600 (landscape)
* Apple’s email reads (via RazorianFly):
* If you deliver a new app binary that takes advantage of the new screen size for iPhone 5 or iPod touch (5th generation) without screenshots in the new dimensions, the status of your app will change to Missing Screenshot.
* One would be wrong to think that disregarding Apple’s advice would go unnoticed.
* Your app will not be reviewed until you upload screenshots with the correct dimensions. You will also need to upload screenshots for any added localizations you have set up on iTunes Connect.
* Apps that have not been specifically refreshed to take advantage of the iPhone 5’s taller display simply get  centered with black letterboxing.
* Note that Apple diligently updated its iLife and iWork iOS suite and other apps yesterday.
* Third-party developers have also been scrambling to push out updates to popular apps ahead of both iOS 6, which was released out of the gate yesterday, and the iPhone 5, which goes on sale in nine countries on Friday at 8am.
* Yes, Facebook’s iOS client has just been updated with iOS 6 and a taller iPhone 5 display in mind.
