* Smartwatch and wearable devices startup Pebble on Tuesday unveiled three new devices: a second-generation Pebble, dubbed the Pebble 2, a new version of the Pebble Time and the Core, a pocket computer for runners wit built-in cellular connectivity.
* The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 are outfitted with better, larger e-ink color displays than their predecessors and introduce more advanced heart rate sensors and longer battery life. The core, a fitness tracker, has an embedded cellular connection, music features, four gigabytes of storage and more.
* “Pebble Core makes lightweight, phone-free fitness tracking, GPS, and music a reality,” explains the company. “Pebble 2 reimagines the essential smartwatch with heart rate-enabled activity tracking. And Pebble Time 2 delivers the ultimate pro smartwatch with a larger, color e-paper screen and heart rate monitoring”.
* Check out the new devices in a promotional video below.
* The $99 Pebble 2 “reimagines the essential smartwatch” with 24/7 heart rate monitoring, activity and sleep tracking and built-in microphone. The device is water-resistant up to thirty meters deep and features a seven-day battery life.

* It’s interesting that the Core streams music from Spotify and syncs GPS data with Runkeeper, Strava and Under Armour Record via Wi-Fi. “In its essence, Core is a tiny, hackable Android computer that fits on your keychain to become your magic button for anything,” wrote the firm.
* And in addition to tracking your pace, distance and location with GPS, the Core can send an emergency SOS if needed. As a bonus, Core’s 4GB of built-in storage let you store your favorite playlists, podcasts and audiobooks on the device, capture voice notes and more.
