* While most of you haven’t yet upgraded to iOS 4.3.2, there are a few folks out there that did by either accident or design. The minor update only contained fixes for FaceTime and Verizon iPad 2 connection problems.
* However, for those that have updated, there are certainly signs that a jailbreak for the new firmware is close. We told you a few days ago that iDevice hacker i0n1c had confirmed via Twitter that the new iOS is vulnerable to his untether used in the 4.3.1 jailbreak. Now he has released the untether for 4.3.2 for anyone interested…
* In similar fashion to the previous jailbreak release, i0n1c has uploaded his untether and released the URL to the download via Twitter. As before I would warn you to avoid this release unless you really know what you are doing. This is far from the easy to use software that a typical jailbreak consists of.
* For those that are interested, he has posted an untether for all recent models of jailbroken iDevices. He also warns that they may not all be 100% working. However the release of a functioning untether does suggest that an official jailbreak release is right around the corner.
* I personally have no reason to upgrade to the new firmware, but folks experiencing the FaceTime issues are obviously anxious to get that fixed. As always, we will keep you updated on the latest jailbreak news, but in the meantime, we advise you wait for a reliable and easy-to-use jailbreak such as RedSn0w or PwnageTool.
* Is anyone looking forward to the 4.3.2 jailbreak?
