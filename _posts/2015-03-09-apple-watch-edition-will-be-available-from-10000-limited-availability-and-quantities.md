* It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for: Apple has finally announced the availability of its Apple Watch Edition, available for $10,000 when pre-orders begin April 10.
* Given the price of the Apple Watch Edition, Apple CEO Tim Cook told attendees at the company’s media event on Monday that it will be available in limited quantities and only in a limited number of Apple Stores.
* The Apple Watch Edition is available in two different sizes, 38 mm and 42 mm, and features cases specially crafted from custom rose or yellow 18-karat gold alloys. The gold is developed to be twice as hard as standard gold, along with a Retina display protected by polished sapphire crystal and a choice of uniquely designed straps and bands with 18-karat gold clasps, buckles or pins.
* It’s been previously reported that Apple will outfit Apple Stores that carry the Apple Watch Edition with safes to house the expensive jewelry overnight.
