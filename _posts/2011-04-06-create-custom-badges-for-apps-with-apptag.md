* Another day, another new jailbreak tweak released in Cydia. The latest jailbreak tweak is called, AppTag.
* You know the little “badges” on applications on the home screen that notify you with the amount of new notifications you have? Well, AppTag is a cool new tweak that will allow you to create custom badges on your iDevice without the use of a computer.

* As with most jailbreak tweaks, there are no new icons for this tweak. You can customize AppTag’s settings from the Settings app.
* The tweak is available for free in Cydia. You do not need to add any new repositories to Cydia.
* Have you tried this new tweak out?
