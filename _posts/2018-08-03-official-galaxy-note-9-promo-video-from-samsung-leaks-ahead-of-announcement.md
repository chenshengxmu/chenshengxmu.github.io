* We know Samsung will be unpacking the next Note at a media event on August 9, and now what appears to be a legitimate promotional video for the upcoming device has apparently leaked out. If it’s an indication, the phablet-class device will look similar to last year’s model.
* On the inside, it almost certainly has faster processors and upgraded cameras. The video mentions an SD card slot allowing users to expand the built-in flash storage to up to one terabyte. The South Korean conglomerate last week released Unpacked 2018 teaser videos that have all but confirmed the aforesaid features and improvements.
* Here’s the video.
* The upcoming phablet has been pretty comprehensively leaked already
* Speaking of improvements, for example, the next Note is expected to have a slightly larger screen and battery, an upgraded S-Pen stylus and improved cameras. As far as the looks go, sources told Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman that Note 9 will be very close to the latest Galaxy S9+, but with a squared-off design.
* Samsung recently sent out press invites for its next “Unpacked” press event, scheduled to take place on Thursday, August 9, at 11am ET, where it will unveil Note 9 and other new products.
* Are you looking forward to the next Note? Do you like Samsung’s multitasking phablet?
* Let us know in the comments!
