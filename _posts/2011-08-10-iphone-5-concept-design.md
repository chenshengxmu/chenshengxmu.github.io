* I know we’ve said this before, but these renderings of what Apple’s upcoming smartphone may look like may truly be some of the best we’ve seen. The iPhone 5 is one of the most anticipated devices in recent years, and artists have made several attempts to predict its design.
* But this particular concept wasn’t constructed from pure imagination. No, this design was built using the measurements from the leaked cases that we’ve seen floating around. Given that case leaks have been fairly accurate in the past, could this really be what the next iPhone looks like?
* Popular Apple blog, MacRumors, has commissioned the folks over at CiccareseDesign to create these high quality renderings, made as closely as possible to the original leaked case designs. Several versions of the case have surfaced, so accessory-makers seem to believe it’s the real deal.

* Even before the leaked cases, rumors of the iPhone 5 sporting a teardrop profile and an elongated home button were tossed about. The larger button is thought to be touch sensitive, so users can deploy gestures to control the on-screen action.

* Even with a 4 inch screen, this design comes in shorter and slimmer than the iPhone 4. Although it is a bit wider. It’s dimensions are 4.33″ x 2.36″ x .27″ at the top and .21″ at the bottom. In comparison, the iPhone 4’s dimensions are 4.5″ x 2.31″ x .37″.

* According to MacRumor’s Arnold Kim, who’s covered every Apple product launch in the last decade, if the leaked case designs hold true, “the iPhone 5 should be close in appearance to these renderings.” And you know what? I’d be ok with that.
* What do you think?
