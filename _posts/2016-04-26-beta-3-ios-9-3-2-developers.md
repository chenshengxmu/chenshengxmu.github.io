* Apple on Tuesday seeded the third beta of iOS 9.3.2 to developers. The update is available to registered developers either via an over-the-air update, or as a standalone download through Apple’s online developer center.
* Today’s release comes just one week after beta 2, suggesting 9.3.2 may soon be ready for launch. From what we’ve seen so far, the update will bring about various under-the-hood improvements, but few user-facing changes.
* In fact, the only notable user-facing change we’ve seen thus far in the first two betas is the ability to use Low Power Mode and Night Shift mode simultaneously. We’re installing beta 3 now, and will let you know if that changes.
* iOS 9.3.2 beta 3 comes more than a month after the feature-packed iOS 9.3 was released to the public, and just under two months before Apple is expected to introduce iOS 10 at its annual World Wide Developers Conference.
