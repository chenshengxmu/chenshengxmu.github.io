* This portable mouse from VicTsing is easy to recommend because of its design, feature set and high consumer rating. It’s a #1 Best Seller on Amazon, with a 4.5 star rating on nearly 2,500 reviews. It has an adjustable DPI switch (2400, 2000, 1600, 1200, 800), 6 customizable buttons and a battery than can last up to 15 months. It connects via 2.4GHz wireless tech, so you’ll have to use the included USB receiver, but it’s very small and can tuck away inside the mouse for storage.
* You can buy the VicTsing 2.4G wireless mouse for $12.

* Some may find this one a bit surprising. Many folks may not even know that Amazon makes computer mice, but it does, under its AmazonBasics brand. Its products are generally very well reviewed and this mouse is no different. You’re not going to get all of the buttons or customizable settings of the more expensive options, but for a wireless optical mouse it’s accurate, has solid battery life and is very low-priced.
* You can buy the AmazonBasics Wireless mouse for $11.50.

* Logitech is one of the more mainstream/recognizable brands in the computer mouse space, and is know for making a solid product. I myself have owned 3-4 Logitech mice over the years and have never run into any issues. If that’s not enough to convince you to get this Marathon Mouse, how about this: battery life can last up to 3 years. Wow. Again you’re not going to get all of the customizable features of a gaming mouse, but for a wireless, everyday-use mouse under $20 this is about as good as they get.
* You can buy the Logitech Marathon mouse for $19.99.

* Here’s an interesting mouse made by a company called UHURU. It’s wireless, extremely portable and has an egg- shaped design similar to that of Apple’s Magic Mouse. What really grabbed our attention with this mouse were its favorable customer reviews (4 stars on Amazon) and its support for Bluetooth connectivity. Using Bluetooth means you won’t have to take up one of your precious USB ports with a wireless dongle, so this can be a big deal for some folks.
* You can buy this UHURU Bluetooth mouse for $17.

* Another sort of unique wireless mouse that gets great customer reviews on Amazon is the Jelly Comb. It uses 2.4G wireless tech, so not as seamless as Bluetooth, but it has a nice slim design and is both portable and durable. It also has easy-click buttons and touts quieter operation than other mice, so if noise (?) is an issue for you this might be worth checking out.
* You can buy the Jelly Comb wireless mouse for $8.80.
