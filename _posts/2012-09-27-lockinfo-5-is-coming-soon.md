title: LockInfo 5 is coming soon
---
* Being one of the most popular reasons to jailbreak, and one of the inspirations behind Apple’s very own Notification Center — it’s safe to say that LockInfo has reached legendary status amongst the jailbreak community.
* With that in mind, anytime there’s a new version on the horizon, many people look on with great interest. LockInfo 5 is the latest major update to the Lock screen notification enhancing app, and the developer has created a teaser video to show off its capabilities.
* Would you like the ability to filter visible notifications by app? What about enhanced notification clearing? Or maybe you’d just like better integration with other jailbreak apps like BiteSMS and TwitkaFly? All of that, and more, is hinted in the teaser video inside. If you’re a fan of LockInfo, you don’t want to miss this…
* The new LockInfo promises to be faster, lighter, and as you can see from the video, full of innovative new features.
* Personally, I was never a huge fan of LockInfo before for various reasons. I guess I just felt a bit overwhelmed by the insane amount of options. But this version looks like something I could seriously benefit from, especially with the new filtering options. I can’t wait to get my hands on it and take it for a spin. What about you?
