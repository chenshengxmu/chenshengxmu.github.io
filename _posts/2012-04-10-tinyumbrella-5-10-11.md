* Semaphore, also known as notcom, has just announced that he has pushed out an update for TinyUmbrella, bringing it to version 5.10.11.
* The new software contains a feature that allows users to save their BBTickets from their iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and CDMA iPhone 4 for later use…
* Notcom has been hinting at this feature for quite some time now, so it’s nice to see it finally implemented. While we’re not positive how it will all play out, we’re assuming that saving BBTickets will make downgrading A5 devices possible at some point.
* As usual, TinyUmbrella 5.10.11 will also save your SHSH blobs — which we recommend doing with all of your devices. We have several tutorials on how to do this, but if you know what you’re doing you can grab the utility from our Downloads page.
* Update: Version 5.10.12 was pushed out shortly after this post was published. We’re assuming it was for minor bug fixes.
