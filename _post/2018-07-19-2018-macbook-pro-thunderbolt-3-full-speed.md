* Are you in the market for a brand new notebook? If so, you’ll be pleased to learn that the flagship $1,799 13-inch model in Apple’s refreshed MacBook Pro lineup for 2018 permits customers to plug high-speed accessories into any of its four Thunderbolt 3 ports without experiencing bandwidth reduction on the two ports located on the righthand side.
* As outlined on Apple’s webpage outlining the technical specifications for the 13-inch model with Touch Bar, the notebook’s four Thunderbolt 3 ports support:
* The entry-level $1,299 and the mid-tier $1,499 machine both feature two full speed Thunderbolt 3 ports while the flagship $1,799 model with Touch Bar is outfitted with four such ports.
* Older 13-inchers released in 2016 and 2017 had two full speed Thunderbolt 3 ports on the left side and a pair of reduced-bandwidth Thunderbolt 3 ports on the right side. This isn’t Apple’s fault: Intel’s 7th and 6th generation Core i5 and i7 chips support up to 12 PCI Express lanes.
* 2018’s MacBook Pros, however, use Intel’s eighth-generation CPU platform with the new processors now supporting up to 16 PCI Express lanes, which gives customers plenty of bandwidth for maximum data transfer speeds up to 40Gb/s on all four Thunderbolt 3 ports.
* As MacRumors observes, this gives 13-inch MacBook Pro owners the freedom to plug higher-performance peripherals into any Thunderbolt 3 port they desire without compromise.
* Thoughts?
