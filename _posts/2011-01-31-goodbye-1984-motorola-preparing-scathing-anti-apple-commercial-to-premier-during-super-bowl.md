* I have to admit, this is a pretty good commercial. But will it actually change anyone’s mind when it comes to purchasing an iPhone or an iPad?
* Will people walk into the Apple store, start playing with all of the products and then think, “You know what, that Motorola commercial had a point… I’m outta here!”
* Highly doubtful, but nice try anyway, Motorola…
* For those of you who can remember that far back, Apple was once the underdog in the industry, and they felt the same way about IBM as Motorola now feels about Apple.
* It was 27 years ago that Apple launched its unforgettable Super Bowl Sunday attack ad against IBM — the dominant company in the computer industry at the time. You’d need a knife to cut through all the irony.
* What do you think about Motorola’s attempt? I actually think it’s quite good; it builds up a lot of tense feelings, and pulls at your nostalgia strings a bit.
* I like Moto, and I’m glad they made a good comeback over the past few years. Still, I don’t think anyone will really care enough to make a difference at this point.
* What do you think?
