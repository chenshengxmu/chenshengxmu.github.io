* Do you use a third-party app to browse Instagram feeds and hashtags more efficiently on an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad?
* If so, there’s a high likelihood that your app has now ceased functioning due to Instagram’s new and much stricter policy pertaining to the official API, which has gone into effect today, as first noted by MacRumors.
* FastFeed for Instagram, a nicely done application which I’ve been using on a regular basis, is one of the many third-party Instagram apps and websites that have stopped working this morning.
* “Instagram made a important platform policy change regarding 3rd party API,” the app’s release notes read. “From June 2016, they disallow 3rd party apps to browsing Instagram photos for general use. Unfortunately, our app is not a exception and will stop working on the 1st of June.”
* Some apps like Gramfeed have been removed from the App Store and many others, including Mixagram for iPhone, also ceased functioning on June 1.
* “As of June 1st 2016, Gramfeed will no longer function,” developers cautioned.
* “To conform with the Instagram API Platform changes, Gramfeed had to be transitioned to a new service called Picodash and is focused on providing the search and social media management functionality to brands, publishers and journalists”.
* “Instagram began reviewing new and existing apps before granting full API access starting December 3, 2015, but the changes for apps created before November 17, 2015 only went into effect on Wednesday, rendering any remaining third-party apps that implemented photo feeds virtually useless,” writes MacRumors.
* According to Instagram’s notice posted on its developer site six months ago, developers should apply for permissions review to continue using the official API.
* The much stricter Instagram platform policy should kill off malicious third-party apps while supporting the following use cases:
* As you can see for yourself, the new rules pretty much rule out any third-party apps designed to make browsing Instagram a more pleasing experience.
