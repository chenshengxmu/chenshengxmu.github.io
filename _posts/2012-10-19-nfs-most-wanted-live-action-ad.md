title: Need for Speed- Most Wanted live action TV commercial is totally dope
---
* You must watch this live action television commercial for Electronic Arts’ Need for Speed: Most Wanted, an open-world racing game – it will totally make your day. The racing sessions have you fighting the cops and the trailer depicts that.
* I instantly fell in love with the spaghetti western type soundtrack. And don’t you just love how they pixelated the finger the driver gave to the cops? Thank actor/writer/director Jon Favreau for that, he’s behind the ad.
* Developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts, Need for Speed: Most Wanted files as the nineteenth title in the long-running series, picking up on the Most Wanted IP rather than the Hot Pursuit reboot that Criterion developed previously…
* Need for Speed: Most Wanted is up for release in North America on November 30. Australia will have to wait until November 1 and Europe the day after. The game will be available on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360 gaming consoles, in addition to Windows PCs, Android devices and – of course – Apple’s iOS platform.
* A version for the iPhone and iPad (seen in a clip below), being developed by Firemonkeys, boasts dynamic physics-based collisions for realistic visual damage, cop takedowns, high speed chases and much more.
* Vehicles at your disposal include classy cars like the Dodge Challenger SRT8 392, the Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale, the Porsche 911 Carrera S and many more. Need for Speed: Most Wanted is scheduled to hit iOS devices on October 30.
* Aren’t you already on the edge of your seat?
