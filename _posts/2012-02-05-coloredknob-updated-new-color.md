* ColoredKnob is a tweak that we covered in the past, and it was met with a fairly warm reception. We really liked it; in fact, the only thing holding us back from absolutely loving it was the limited amount of colors available in the initial release.
* Apparently the developer heard our cries, because ColoredKnob has just been updated with a ton of new colors, making it much more appealing that it was before…
* ColoredKnob is a wonderful way to customize your ‘Slide to Unlock’ nub because it doesn’t require any theming apps like WinterBoard to work; all you do is install it and go.
* Best of all, even with the update and the bevy of new colors, it’s still free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* If you haven’t checked out ColoredKnob, check it out and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
