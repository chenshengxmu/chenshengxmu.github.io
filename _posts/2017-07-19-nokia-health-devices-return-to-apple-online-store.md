* Apple’s online store is again selling Nokia’s iPhone-connected health devices almost two months after the two companies reached an agreement in their patent infringement battle.
* The Nokia accessories available to purchase from Apple Online Store include Body Cardio Scale, Body+ Scale, BPM+ Blood Pressure Monitor and Thermo Thermometer.
* They’re all in stock and available with free shipping.
* The devices were previously sold under the French brand Withings. In April 2016, Nokia acquired Withings for a reported $192 million and retired that brand last month.
* Licensing disputes between Apple and Nokia across the United States and Europe led to the removal of the latter’s Withings-branded products from Apple Stores.
* In May, the two companies signed a cross-license agreement which put an end to all litigation.
* Under the terms of the multi-year patent agreement, Nokia will receive an upfront cash payment from Apple and additional revenues during the term of the agreement.
* Nokia will also provide “certain network infrastructure products and services” to Apple.
