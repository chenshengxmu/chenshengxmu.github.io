* A few days ago, iH8sn0w released v2.9.2 of his popular jailbreak tool, Sn0wBreeze. The update added the ability for users to jailbreak their iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1 (yes, it’s still tethered).
* Then last night, the hacker seeded another version of the software, bringing it to v2.9.3. This update includes a minor bug fix, but also features new jailbreak support for Apple TV’s on iOS 4.4.3 and 4.4.4…
* IH8sn0w published the full change log to his blog last night:
* “sn0wbreeze v2.9.3.
* What is New?
* Just adding this in mainly for users who dumped their SHSH blobs. On the initial boot, the Apple TV may have a black screen for 60 seconds after setting up the Apple TV. This is normal.”
* If you’re looking for the latest version of Sn0wBreeze, you can find it on our Downloads page. If you need help with the software, we have several tutorials on how to use it. Keep in mind that it is for Windows users only.
