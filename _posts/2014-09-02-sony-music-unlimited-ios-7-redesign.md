* Music Unlimited, the PlayStation music app from Sony optimized for the iPhone, at last has received its long-overdue iOS 7 refresh bringing it in line with Apple’s design language for iOS.
* Nearly two and a half years following its debut, the app now finally sits at version 2.0 with half a dozen new features and a fresh new look owing to the use of iOS 7 styling and a flattened Home screen icon.
* If you have the PlayStation console and use the Music Unlimited service, you’re going to be appreciative not only of its crisp typography and user interface, but also of a lot faster and more reliable performance. Jump past the fold for a quick highlight of the most important new features.
* For starters, I’m not sure that I’m digging the new app icon.

* In case you haven’t tried out Music Unlimited yet, the free of charge service is a cross between an Internet radio and an on-demand music streaming service. For instance, you can stream music or download cherry-picked tracks to your iOS device for listening without a network connection.
* In addition to enjoying human-currated playlists (you can create your own, too), Music Unlimited supports track skipping and lets you create set-and-forget music channels.
* And unlike iTunes Radio and similar services, Music Unlimited is ad-free and delivers high-quality 320 kbps audio — again, free of charge.
* Music Unlimited 2.0 highlights:
* By the way, they could have at least ensured that the device used to take official screenshots was fully charged beforehand.

* Licensed and powered by Omnifone, Music Unlimited supports AirPlay, lets you share your favorite tracks on Twitter and Facebook, view discography, top songs, related artists and other information, and more.
* The 13.2-megabyte download supports the iPhone and iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later, though the native iPad interface is still inexplicably missing in action.
* If you’re among the few remaining holdouts who prefer owning rather than renting their music, Sony recently released a new iPhone app called Album Of The Day with daily deals on select albums from Sony artists found on iTunes.
