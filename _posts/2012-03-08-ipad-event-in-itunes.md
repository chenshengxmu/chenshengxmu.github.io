* If you’re anything like us, and if you’re reading this you probably are, then you’re the kind of person who likes to kick back with a coffee and enjoy a good Apple event in all its glory. That means on a big-screen TV, not hunched over a MacBook screen.
* Now you can see the announcement of the iPad 3, sorry, new iPad, on a screen large enough to do it justice, with Apple now making the event available to download via iTunes.
* That also means, dear friends, that you can also check the event out on your Apple TV. Like we did. Twice…
* Yep, we can’t get enough of these things.
* The video itself can be found inside the Podcast section of iTunes, and searching for “Apple Keynotes” is probably the easiest way to find it.
* If you’re going to download the whole event for watching back later then you’ll need nearly a gigabyte of space in order to do so. Weighing in at 980MB, the March special event runs for a total of 85 minutes and we’re sure you’ll love every minute of it.
* We know we did.
