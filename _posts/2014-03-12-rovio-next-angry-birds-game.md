* Over the weekend, Rovio posted a teaser trailer for an unknown, upcoming Angry Birds title. The clip was short, and offered up few details about the game outside of showing a bird wearing knight’s armor and announcing countries that would participate in the soft launch.
* Well today, the studio revealed that the game is going to be called Angry Birds Epic and it’s not going to be the typical bird-flinger. In fact, far from it. The new title will actually fall into the ‘adventure role-playing’ genre, with a turn-based combat system and extensive crafting…

* Kotaku has the report:
* “Angry Birds developer Rovio said they were teasing an epic new game, and they weren’t kidding. Soft launching in Australia and Canada this week, Angry Birds Epic is an adventure role-playing game with turn-based combat and an extensive crafting system. I did not see this coming.
* Sounds like crafting will be an important part of the game as well, with players making armor, potions, and weapons using resources either won in the game or purchased via real currency.”
* As the site points out, it appears that Australia and Canada will see the game launch this week, but the rest of the world will have to wait a few weeks. Rovio has another game in the oven right now called Angry Birds Stella, but it isn’t expected to be released until later this year.
