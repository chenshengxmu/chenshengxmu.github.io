* If you’ve been looking for a wallet-case combo for a new iPhone 5s, or your current iPhone 5, you may want to check out OtterBox. The company just announced a new Commuter Series Wallet case.
* The case will fit both the iPhone 5 and 5s, and combines OtterBox’s legendary toughness with the slimmer design of its Commuter series. And on the back, a space for your credit cards and money…
* Here’s the promotional clip for the new case:
