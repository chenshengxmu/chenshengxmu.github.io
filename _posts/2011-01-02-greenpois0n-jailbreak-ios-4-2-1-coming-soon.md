* According to a recent tweet from P0sixNinja, the iPhone hacker behind GreenPois0n, an updated version of the jailbreak will be released as soon as he finishes adding the new sandbox patches.
* There are good reasons to think that this jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 will be a tethered jailbreak, thus requiring you to plug your iPhone in and boot it with GreenPois0n every time you shut down your iPhoneâ€¦
* GreenPois0n was first released a few months ago to jailbreak iPhone iOS 4.1. It is a quick and easy jailbreak that require very little action. While there are no official ETA, we all hope a GreenPois0n jailbreak for 4.2.1 will be available sooner rather than later.
* In the meanwhile, the Dev Team is still working on an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 with RedSn0w, which is still in beta.
