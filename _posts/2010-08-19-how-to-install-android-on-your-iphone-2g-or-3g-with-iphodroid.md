title: How to Install Android on Your iPhone 2G or 3G with iPhoDroid
---
* Android on the iPhone is more of a “project” than anything else. It’s buggy, unstable, and doesn’t even bring all the features needed to fully use the iPhone. So why in the hell would you install Android on your iPhone? Just for the heck of it, of course! Thanks to Sergio McFly, this is now easily possible.

* iPhoDroid 1shot is probably the easiest way to install Android on your iPhone 2G or iPhone 3G. It doesn’t require any file editing or anything that might scared the least technically advanced of us. Without further ado, here are the instructions to set up Android on your iPhone. As usual, proceed at your own risks…
* Step 1: Make sure your iPhone is jailbroken and Cydia is up to date. If it’s not jailbroken, do so by using JailbreakMe.
* Step 2: Download the latest version of iPhoDroid 1 shot from here. The download link is at the very bottom left of the page.
* Step 3: Make sure your iPhone is connected to your computer via the USB cable. Launch iPhoDroid and click “shoot”.
* Step 4: iPhoDroid will extract the touch driver and transfer the cache/system/data folders to your iPhone.
* Step 5: iPhoDroid will now place your iPhone in recovery mode.
* Step 6: After that, you will get the OpeniBoot splash page with different options (Apple, Android, Install, Uninstall). Use the volume buttons to highlight the “Install” option, then tap the Home button to select it.
* Step 7: Some code will then be running on your screen. Once done, your iPhone will reboot in the Android OS.
* Done! You can now enjoy your crippled iPhone running Android.
