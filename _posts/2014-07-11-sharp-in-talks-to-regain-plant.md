* Sharp is looking to regain control of its Kameyama plant back from Apple. Nikkei is reporting this afternoon that the company has proposed a deal to the Cupertino firm worth nearly $300 million, in an effort to diversify its customer base.
* The Kameyama Plant No. 1 began operations in 2004 as a facility for manufacturing large panels for flat-screen TVs. But after consecutive years of profit losses, it called on Apple to help foot the bill to transition the plant to smaller panels…
* Here’s more from the Nikkei report:
* OSAKA — Sharp is looking to buy smartphone panel production equipment at one of its Kameyama plants in Mie Prefecture from Apple in a bid to diversify its customer base. The Japanese company has proposed 30 billion yen ($293 million) or so for the deal, according to a source close to the matter. […]
* The plant now runs at an operating rate above 90%, making panels for new iPhones scheduled to debut this fall. With the utilization rate seen remaining high for the time being, “we don’t have to rush” to close the deal, a senior Sharp official said. Negotiations between the two companies could thus drag out.
* As part of the proposed deal, Sharp seeks to buy smartphone display manufacturing tools, and a leadership role at the factory. This would allow the company to produce panels for other handset makers, decreasing its dependency on Apple.
* Apple typically sources components from several suppliers, but it’s unclear how willing it will be to give up the Kameyama plant. With it currently running above 90% efficiency, and IGZO display tech on the rise, Sharp is still very important to it.
