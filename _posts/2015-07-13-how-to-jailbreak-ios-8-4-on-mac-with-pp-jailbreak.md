* The PP untethered jailbreak for iOS 8.4 is out, and it has been confirmed to work. As we continue to wait on a possible TaiG jailbreak for Mac, the 25PP team is making it so that Mac users can jailbreak now.
* Of course, you can always use the virtual machine method for jailbreaking iOS 8.4 using TaiG on Mac, but the PP jailbreak tool is as simple as simple gets for Mac users. Inside, we’ll show you how to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 8.4 on Mac using PP jailbreak.
* Note: We advise you to begin on a freshly restored iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. The device should be running iOS 8.4, though it will work on all firmwares between iOS 8.1.3 and iOS 8.4. Close iTunes and Xcode before starting.
* Step 1: Download the PP jailbreak tool from our downloads page, open it and drag it to your Applications folder
* Step 2: Connect your iPhone running iOS 8.4 to your Mac
* Step 3: Disable Find My iPhone, passcode, and enable Airplane mode
* Step 4: Run PP jailbreak and make sure it detects your device
* Step 5: Make sure the Install PP helper option is unchecked
* Step 6: Click the Jailbreak button, read the instructions, and click the Continue button
* Step 7: Don’t touch your iPhone and let the jailbreak finish
* Step 8: Once the iOS 8.4 jailbreak completes, you may have to go through some of the iOS setup process. Once you get through that, find Cydia on your Home screen and launch Cydia
* That’s all there is to it. Enjoy your newly jailbroken device!
* Did it work for you?
