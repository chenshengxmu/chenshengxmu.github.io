* On par with the launch of any device from Apple, third-party case makers have taken rumors, maybe a little insider knowledge, and some guessing to theorize what the design of the next-generation iPhone could be, long before the launch.
* YouTube channel Unbox Therapy got its hands on one of these cases floating around, and compared it alongside the iPhone 5s and iPod touch. The striking factor for the purported iPhone 6 case wasn’t the height difference, but that its thinness matched up with the iPod touch, perfectly. 
* Past the 6mm thinness, the purported iPhone 6 case shows a button design similar to the iPod touch, ditching the volume buttons first introduced on the iPhone 4. This move would be Apple matching the design to other devices in its line-up, including the iPad Air and iPad mini.
* In related news, a posting on the MacRumors forum on Monday showed a possible volume button for the iPhone 6 that uses a flatter design compared to the iPhone 5s.

* Is this a legitimate case? There’s really no telling, but it’s always fun to theorize.
