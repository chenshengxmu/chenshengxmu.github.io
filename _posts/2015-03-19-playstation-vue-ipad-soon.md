* Yesterday, Sony launched its long-anticipated streaming television service called PlayStation Vue in select markets like Chicago, New York City and Philadelphia. The online video subscription service doesn’t require a cable or satellite subscription.
* It will be initially available on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 consoles and is coming to Apple’s iPad “in the near future,” the Japanese giant has confirmed.
* The service couples live and on-demand television programming to a cloud based DVR, allowing PlayStation console owners to stream television shows, Hollywood movies and sports to their living room, without a cable or satellite subscription.

* In exchange for a flat fee of fifty bucks per month, users get a total of 53 various channels, including content from broadcast networks CBS, Fox and NBC, as well as cable networks TNT, MTV, Nickelodeon, CNN and Comedy Central.
* A higher-tiered $60 per month plan expands on the channel selection with the addition of regional sports networks like YES, Comcast SportsNet Chicago and Philadelphia and Big Ten. Upgrading to a $70 per month service gives you expanded cable options with FXM, Sprout and more.
* The Vue service includes discovery tools to help you filter thousands of shows and the cloud based DVR makes it easy to save shows for up to 28 days.
* The service is available in the PlayStation Store on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 console, or through the official website. A seven-day free trial is available.
* “We are working hard to deliver PlayStation Vue to more cities soon,” said Sony. “We are also bringing PlayStation Vue to iPad in the near future.”
* Apple announced at its “Spring Forward” media event a partnership with HBO that will see the new $15 per month HBO Now online-only video subscription launch exclusively on the $69 Apple TV set-top box.
* The iPhone maker is reportedly readying a web-based television service of its own for launch this fall. According to The Wall Street Journal, it will provide a selection of more than two dozen cherry-picked channels in exchange for $30-$40 per month.
* Apple’s talks with programmers about a TV bundle don’t include NBCUniversal due to a falling-out between Apple and NBCUniversal’s parent company, Comcast Corp. A leaked internal memo has revealed NBC’s plans to debut an Apple TV channel in the second half of this year.
