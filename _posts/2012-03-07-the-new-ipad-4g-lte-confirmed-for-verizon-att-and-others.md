* The rumors were true. The new iPad will come equipped with a 4G LTE option for speeds much faster than current 3G speeds.
* Even better is the fact that almost everyone in the United States will be able to benefit, because LTE is for both Verizon and AT&T, just as we expected.
* But folks in other countries wonâ€™t be left out. Verizon, Rogers, Bell, Telus and AT&T are all featured LTE partners.
* Not only that, but the new tablet will feature 21Mbps HSPA+, 42Mbps DC-HSDPA, and a mind numbing 73Mbps for LTE connections.
* The new iPad is simply a beast on all levels. Will you be opting for an LTE enabled version?
