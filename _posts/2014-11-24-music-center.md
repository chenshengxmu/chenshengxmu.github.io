* If you’ve ever wanted to be able to browse your entire music library from Notification Center, then you should check out Music Center in the App Store. Developed by jailbreak alumni Akhil Tolani, Music Center is a great idea that is unfortunately handicapped by Apple’s restrictions on what you can do with Notification Center extensions.
* After adding the extensions to Notification Center, you can launch Music Center in order to customize it. The user isn’t left with many options as you can only choose between a list and tiles view for your music library. Both views can be seen on the screenshot above. The list view is to the left, and the tiles view to the right.
* To navigate through your library, simply tap the Up or Down arrow. My brain has been trained by iOS to just swipe when I need to scroll up or down, so the use of arrows can sometimes be counter-intuitive, but as I previously noted, this is one of the limitations of iOS in terms of what an extension can do, and not necessarily the developer’s fault.
* Songs are listed by alphabetical order and there is no way to rearrange this. Once you find a song you want to listen to, simply tap on it and it will start playing.
* While I really like the concept of the extension, it’s just barely usable in its current state. I have a library of about 7,000 songs, so getting to the bottom of that list would be more than cumbersome with Music Center. But I guess if you have a small library of a few hundred songs, then you might have better luck.
* Music Center is a free download in the App Store. if you do give it a try, make sure to come back here and let us know what you think about it.
