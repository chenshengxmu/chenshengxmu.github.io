* After releasing a massive update to its freemium iPhone and iPad password-keeping application back in January, developer AgileBits on Tuesday posted a matching update on the Mac App Store, bringing support for two-factor authentication codes and a bunch of other improvements to its 1Password for Mac utility.
* In addition to two-step verification, the app has gained the ability to email and start a FaceTime Audio or Skype call by clicking numbers in the Identities section and given some existing features “a big power-up.”
* Two-step verification is an additional layer of security for popular online services and accounts such as those from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Tumblr, Dropbox and many others.
* The system works by requiring you to confirm your username and password when logging into service by entering a one-time code sent via SMS or generated by specialized mobile apps like Google’s free Authenticator app or alternatives like Authy.
* Now 1Password for Mac, just as its iPhone and iPad counterpart, can generate these one-time codes. Simply edit your existing service details in 1Password (like Dropbox, for example) to add the new One-Time Password field.

* Next, visit your service’s online settings, enable two-step verification and follow the on-screen instructions. You’ll be presented with a scannable QR code.
* Now drag and drop the barcode from your browser into 1Password’s barcode scanner or place its window over the barcode to scan it, as shown above. Once added, these unique two-step codes can be generated right inside 1Password for Mac, where all your passwords are safely kept anyway, without an Internet connection.
* In addition to two-step verification and a bunch of custom fields, this edition also brings out such goodies as custom fields and sections in Secure Notes, better date handling, improved searching and more.
* 1Password 5.3 for Mac changelog:
* Two-steps stronger
* Faster communication
* +5 power bonus to customization
* Better date handling
* And a better brain
* The update is free to existing users.
* You can check out the full details in the official release notes.
* 1Password for Mac is $49.99 in the Mac App Store.
* The iPhone and iPad edition is available on a freemium basis in the App Store. A Pro upgrade with advanced functionality available as a one-time $9.99 In-App Purchase.
* A week ago, the iOS edition of 1Password gained the ability to create logins and other items without switching to the main app and other improvements.
