* Creative software maker Adobe on Tuesday pushed a brand new version of itsÂ Photoshop Express mobile app for iPhone and iPad on App Store with several improvements, including a new Send to Photoshop feature and souped up photo collages.
* With the Send to Photoshop feature, users of the app can take their edits from mobile to desktop for a full-blown experience. All your edits made in Photoshop Express are automatically exposed by the app as layers in desktop Photoshop, giving you total control.
* Adobe hopes this feature will open up infinite possibilities and take your creations to the next level. Bumped to version 6.2, Photoshop Express includes a few other refinements as well.
* The app finally permits you to delete unwanted images directly from the image picker. Also, you can now enhance your photo collages by adding fun and interesting artwork.
* Aside from the aforementioned outward-facing changes, Photoshop Express 6.2 includes unspecified bug fixes and other feature enhancements.
* Adobe Photoshop Express is a free download from App Store.
