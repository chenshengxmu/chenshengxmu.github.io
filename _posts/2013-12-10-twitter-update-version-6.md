* Twitter has updated its official iOS client today, bringing the app to version 6.0. The update is a fairly significant one, bringing about a new look and feel for the app, as well as photo-sharing for direct messages, improved search and more.
* The new look pushes the UI of the Twitter app further into iOS 7 territory. There’s more white spacing—the menu bar at the bottom is now all white— and texts and graphics seem flatter. And Twitter has added various other enhancements…
* Here’s the 6.0 change log:
* New design. – Refreshed look and feel. Home, Activity and Discover now available by swiping in Timelines. Easier access to DMs. Share photos in Direct Messages. – Send and receive photos via DMs. Notifications from your network. – Choose to view replies, retweets, and favorites from only the people that you follow. Search got even easier. – Access tweets from people you follow and near you, directly from search results. Safari Reading List support – Save web articles to read later with Safari Reading List
* I actual really like the design tweaks Twitter has made today, and I especially like that they’ve simplified the menu bar. Where as before it read Home-Connect-Discover-Me, now it reads Timelines-Notifications-Messages-Me. Much more clear.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of Twitter, for both iPhone and iPad, in the App Store for free. Also, if you’re not already, be sure to follow iDB on Twitter so you can get notifications for new posts, giveaways and much more.
