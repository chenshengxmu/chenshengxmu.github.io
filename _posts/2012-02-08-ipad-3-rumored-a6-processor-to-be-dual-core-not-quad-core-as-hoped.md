title: iPad 3 rumored A6 processor to be Dual-Core, not Quad-Core as hoped?
---
* Today, more details about the upcoming iPad 3 emerged, when Fix iPhones showed us the supposed back of the iPad 3. In the report, it was noted that the iPad 3 was to have an updated camera, larger battery, and new screen.

* To add to the rumors earlier, The Verge has come out with a new report, saying that the iPad 3’s rumored A6 processor will be dual-core, and not quad-core as people have hoped…
* We’re also told that the A6 CPU the iPad 3 is likely to sport will include a significantly more powerful GPU — no big surprise there. What is surprising, however, is that our sources say that the A6 will not be a quad-core chip, but will remain dual-core. We’ve previously had heard that the device would have a quad-core CPU as well as an LTE cell radio on-board, but at least part of that story wasn’t accurate.
* The Verge’s report contradicts Bloomberg’s, who said that the iPad 3 A6 processor was to be dual-core, but today’s report says otherwise. A quad-core processor makes sense out of Apple, to maybe compete with the abundance of Android tablets that feature quad-core processors. But, Apple doesn’t always sway to how where the market is. The report also says there is chance an LTE radio could be on-board, but that doesn’t seem as likely.
* Like in typical fashion, the A6 processor will most likely make its way to the iPhone 5, which is rumored to launch this summer. The iPad 2 launched with the A5 processor, which Apple then put into the recent iPhone 4S.
* The Verge makes an interesting side note regarding when the iPad 3 might be announced. Since there are only 29 days in February, Apple could announce the new tablet on February 29th with the theme “It’s time to leap ahead.” The iPad 3 would then be ready to go on sale two weeks later, in time for the SXSW conference — just like last year. Of course at this point, the announcement is just pure speculation.
* How do you feel about the iPad 3 not sporting a quad-core processor?
