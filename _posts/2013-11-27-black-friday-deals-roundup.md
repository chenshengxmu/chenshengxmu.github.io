* Black Friday is now just a few days away, meaning folks planning to do some bargain shopping this weekend don’t have much longer to put their game plan together. The day is infamously hectic, for both retailers and consumers, thanks to limited-time and supply sales and unruly crowds of shoppers, so planning ahead is crucial.
* But never fear, iDB has you covered this year with a complete guide on where to locate the best deals. We’ve sifted through as many Black Friday ads as we could get our hands on in order to find out which stores are going to be worth going to this weekend, so you don’t have to. Presenting our first Black Friday Deals Roundup…
* This is a running list, and we plan to add to it over the next few days as more deals get announced. So make sure you continue to check back with us periodically throughout the week. Good luck!
