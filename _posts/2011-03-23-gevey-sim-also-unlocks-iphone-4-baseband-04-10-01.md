* Last week we told you about the Gevey SIM which basically unlocks any iPhone 4. Today, a video confirms that the Gevey SIM can unlock any iPhone 4 on any iOS and any baseband. This means that if you have an iPhone 4 4.3 with baseband 04.10.01, the Gevey SIM will work for you too.
* While this Gevey SIM card sounds like a miracle, it does come with a few drawbacks which might frighten some of you…
* At $70, this looks like the only option to unlock your iPhone 4 for the time being. If you don’t have the money or prefer a software unlock, let’s wait to see what the Dev Team has up its sleeves.
* Will you give it a try?
