* Many people are complaining about poor battery life after deploying the latest iOS 10.1.1 software update on their iPhone, which released for public consumption on October 31 and squashed bugs where Health data couldn’t be viewed for some users.
* Aside from this, it seems that iOS 10.1.1 is also causing some iPhones to shut down abruptly when the battery charge falls below a certain percentage, according to a thread on Apple’s support forums that at post time had thirteen pages.
* Multiple reports on Twitter and from the affected people who flocked to Apple’s discussion forums suggest that the problem affects many iPhone models, including the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and even the latest iPhone 7 devices.

* One user claims that turning off iOS 10’s new Raise to Wake feature has helped solve the problem, but I couldn’t verify this on one of the affected devices I own.
* Anyone else notice their iPhone 6 battery only lasts like 20 minutes with the latest iOS update?

* My iPhone 6s got plagued with this issue after upgrading to iOS 10.1.1.
* As for my iPhone 7 Plus, it shows no signs of any battery woes whatsoever. For what it’s worth, I upgraded my iPhone 6s from iOS 9 to iOS 10 via an over-the-air update. As for my iPhone 7 Plus, I set it up as new rather than restore from a backup.
* It’s possible that the cruft which inevitably gets accumulated from earlier iOS installations may be causing this. I always tell friends and family to install major iOS versions from scratch rather than upgrade in order to get the best performance, optimized battery life and as much free storage as possible.

* I use my iPhone 6s much in the same way daily as I used to before updating to iOS 10.1.1 and it usually shuts down at some point after the battery falls below the fifty percent mark, typically around the 30+ percent mark.
* After shutting down, the device won’t boot unless connected to its charger and shows an empty battery icon as if the battery charge was completely depleted. As soon as the phone boots, however, iOS’s status indicator shows the battery charge sitting comfortably above the 30 percent mark.
* My iPhone 6s isn’t even among “a very small number” of devices manufactured between September and October 2015 that Apple has admitted may unexpectedly shut down and started offering a free repair program for.
* After talking to a few local authorized service technicians, I was told that this is a known software issue in iOS which will be fixed in a future update.
* Is your iPhone affected by this?
* If so, we’d like to hear from you in the comments.
