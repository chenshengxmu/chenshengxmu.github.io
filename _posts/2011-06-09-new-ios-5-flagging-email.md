* If you’ve been looking for a more elegant way to mark your email in Apple’s Mail app, iOS 5 may have what you’re looking for. In iOS 5, you now have the ability to “Flag” messages in the Mail app as important. The flags can be used to access certain emails for quick reference, or show you what messages are the most important to you.
* This new flagging feature is basically just like marking emails as important in Gmail. If you are a heavy user of the Mail app, you’ll probably appreciate this addition in iOS 5.
