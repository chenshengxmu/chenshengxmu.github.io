* On WWDC 2016 eve, many rumors are piling up about tomorrow’s event. We covered a full round up of expectations to get you reading for the big day. Personally, I’m most excited about what a new watchOS could bring to the wrist. My fingers are crossed for a watch face library that can be submitted by independent designers and developers. A little more control over the complications would be great!
* As we wait these final hours, take a step inside for one last round of WWDC wallpapers. Everyone has been kind to share them as they are completed, by catching me on Twitter @jim_gresham. If you would like to share walls in the future, just catch me there. But today, step inside for two more sets of WWDC goodness.
* The first set of wallpapers, with syntax background, was submitted by @im4hdi. Thanks for sharing your work with the iDB community!
