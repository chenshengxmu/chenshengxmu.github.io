* Throughout the wallpaper section, we host theme wallpapers, feature specific artists, or highlight trends with movies, TV shows, and the like.  Of course, we always keep up with the latest Apple announcement wallpapers and even store openings, like the most recent in Japan.
* However, current events are not usually our inspiration. Then again, with the Wallpapers of the Week section only recently celebrating its first birthday, only several major events have excited the whole world. Thanks to a global readership, we like to highlight wallpapers that all can enjoy. This week, as the FIFA World Cup narrows the field, equip your iOS devices for the final rounds…
* Enjoy several World Cup wallpapers below. The stadium is a masterfully created arena and even the series fútbol has an attractive design.
