* Apple has picked up another high profile engineer for its self-driving car project. The Information reports that the company has hired Jaime Waydo, an autonomous vehicle expert who previously worked at NASA, and was more recently a senior engineer at Google’s Waymo division.
* Waydo was in charge of verifying the safety of Waymo’s prototypes, determining when they were safe enough for real-world testing. Citing former colleagues, The Information says the engineer played an ‘instrumental’ role in launching Waymo’s on-the-road tests in Phoenix in 2016.
* An Apple spokesman confirmed the hiring, but declined to speak on her role at the company. Regardless the pick-up signals some progress for the iPhone-maker’s otherwise stagnate Project Titan, which has seemingly lost steam in the media and auto industry over the last several months.
