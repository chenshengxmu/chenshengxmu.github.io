* Emojis are quickly taking over in the world of texting, and a new free jailbreak tweak called IconKeyb10 by iOS developer GeoSn0w helps future-proof your texting habits by automatically inserting the Emoji equivalents of certain characters from the iOS keyboard.
* The screenshot shown above is rather self-explanatory. Rather than typing the numeric characters “1,” “2,” “3,” etc. when you tap on those keys from the iOS keyboard, the tweak inserts the Emoji counterparts instead.
* The tweak also seems to work with the asterisk “*” symbol, automatically replacing it with the asterisk Emoji when typed from the keyboard, but we couldn’t find any other special keyboard characters that IconKeyb10 automatically replaced with Emojis in our testing.
* The tweak appears to work inside of every app, as long as Emojis are supported. This means you’re not confined to using them in texting; you can also use them in note-taking, social media posts, and more.
* From the start, IconKeyb10 takes some getting used to, especially if you aren’t used to Emojis popping up in every single sentence involving numbers. Nevertheless, it’s a tweak the developer says he made “just for fun” because it seemed like an interesting idea to toy around with.
* Because the tweak is purely cosmetic, its appeal will likely be limited to those who enjoy using Emojis on a regular basis. On the other hand, the tweak can help you add some character to your texts without the added effort of searching for certain Emojis manually.
* With that last idea in mind, IconKeyb10 should work great in tandem with a recent tweak release called Selectmoji, which lets you manually designate your favorite Emoji for quicker access.
* If you’re interested in giving IconKeyb10 a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t come with any options to configure and is compatible with all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Are you down with having your numbers replaced with numeric Emojis every time you type? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
