* According to several reliable sources within the jailbreak community, it looks like the TaiG jailbreak will remain working after the iOS 8.1.2 update. Although the TaiG tool will need to be updated to include iOS 8.1.2 support, it shouldn’t take any new exploits or re-enginering on the developer end to include support for iOS 8.1.2.
* Not sure if this was already said… But judging by http://t.co/MeVEKpqOvI, 8.1.2 should still be vulnerable to taig jb.

* Not only did @iH8sn0w tweet out his thoughts on the iOS 8.1.2 release, but others, such as @iAdam1n have voiced their thoughts on the matter as well.
* Well it seems that the kernel exploit used in TaiG for iOS 8.1.1 is not patched as the kernel version is the same on 8.1.2 as 8.1.1.

* Although there’s certainly more to the jailbreak than kernel exploits, signs are pointing to the fact that all we need is an update from TaiG to officially recognize iOS 8.1.2. But until we hear the official word from TaiG themselves, we can’t be 100% sure of anything.
* In the meantime, stay planted on iOS 8.1.1 until word comes from the horse’s mouth. Besides, there’s nothing groundbreaking in iOS 8.1.2 that warrants a quick update to the firmware to begin with.
* As soon as we hear word from TaiG, we’ll be sure to keep you informed. We’ll also be sure to update our TaiG jailbreak tutorial with any new information if necessary.
