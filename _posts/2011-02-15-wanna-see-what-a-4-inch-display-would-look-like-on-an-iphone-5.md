title: Wanna See What a 4-Inch Display Would Look Like on an iPhone 5?

* Earlier today we reported there were rumors going around the web claiming that the iPhone 5 might come with a 4-inch screen, increasing from the current 3.5-inch display. When I first read about that, I really wondered what it could look like. Then the fine folks at 9to5Mac came up with a mockup of a 4-inch display applied to the iPhone 4 hardware.
* The result as you can see is not very pretty. The screen goes all the way to the edge and the size of the home button has to be reduced to fit. Following rumors from last month, Apple could even go as far as removing the home button altogether…
* Of course these are only rumors and we won’t know for sure until Apple unveils the iPhone 5 (or until Gizmodo get their hands on it!).
* What do you think?
