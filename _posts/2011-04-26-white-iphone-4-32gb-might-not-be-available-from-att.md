* If you were one of the few that’s planning on getting a white iPhone 4 in the 32GB storage capacity from an AT&T store this Wednesday, you might not be able to.
* According to an internal AT&T shipping invoice obtained by the folks over at Boy Genius Report, while AT&T stores are scheduled to receive the 16GB version of the white iPhone 4, the 32GB model is nowhere to be found on the invoice. 
* It’s been a long wait for those of you dying to get your hands on the white version of the iPhone 4, and the wait will finally come to an end this Wednesday.
* If you had been planning on picking up a white iPhone 4 32GB from a nearby AT&T store on Wednesday, you might want to take another route. I hear Best Buy will have both storage capacities available in stores!
* Were any of you planning on purchasing a 32GB white iPhone 4 from an AT&T store?
