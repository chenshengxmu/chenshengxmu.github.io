* Two days ago, Apple released watchOS 3.2 for all Apple Watch models with two newsworthy improvements: Siri in apps and a new Theater Mode toggle in Control Center. With watchOS 3.2, Apple’s SiriKit framework that debuted alongside iOS 10 is now available to watchOS developers.
* With SiriKit, developers can now implement Siri commands in Apple Watch apps for messaging, payments, ride-booking, workouts, calling and searching photos. This should be great for feature parity: it’s confusing being able to message people via Viber on iPhone, but not with Viber for Apple Watch.

* As for Theater Mode, toggling it in Control Center puts your watch into silent mode while keeping the screen dark until you tap it or press the Digital Crown or the Side button.
* Theater Mode is great when you’d like to prevent notifications from disturbing others whilst ensuring that you’re still getting haptic feedback for incoming alerts.

* Other watchOS 3.2 improvements include Scribble in three new languages, a new audible alert on your wrist after you unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch and a minor visual change in the companion Watch app, which now displays a handy progress bar when songs are being transferred to your wrist-worn device for untethered listening.
