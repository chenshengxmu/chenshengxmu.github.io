* Episode 004: Sebastien, Cody, and Jeff talk about what it’s like to work from home and write about iOS all day, Sebastien’s Oceanhorn addiction, favorite Google Reader Replacements, exciting ideas for the future of Touch ID, iPhone 6 rumors and more. Unfortunately, we experienced some technical difficulties with this week’s episode, so the sound quality is significantly beneath our standard sound. This should be fixed going forward. Thank you for tuning in.
