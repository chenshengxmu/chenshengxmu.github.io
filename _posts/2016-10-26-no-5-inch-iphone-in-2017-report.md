* A new report is out late Wednesday rebuffing an earlier claim that Apple intends to release 3 iPhone models next year. Citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans, AppleInsider says the company will be sticking with its 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handset sizes in 2017.
* For those that missed it, Asian news outlet Nikkei reported Wednesday morning that Apple would be adding a 5-inch option to its current two-size lineup. It didn’t, however, explain why it would want to do so, given how close it would be to the 4.7-inch model.
* Contrary to reports on Wednesday claiming Apple intends to release three new iPhone models in 2017, including a middle-of-the-road 5-inch iteration, a source tells AppleInsider immediate plans are to stick with the usual 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch flagships. 
* Following a trend started with the iPhone 6 debut in 2014, Apple next year will unveil two —and only two — flagship iPhone models, according to person who has in the past provided accurate information on Apple’s product pipeline. Like this year’s iPhone 7 series, the 2017 iPhone will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes.
* It’s worth noting AppleInsider doesn’t have much of a track record in predicting Apple’s plans, and since we’re still a year away from the next iPhone’s introduction anyway, those plans are likely going to change a number of times over the next several months.
* Still, expectations are high for the 2017 iPhone. It’s believed that Apple is working on a significant upgrade for its popular handset that’s rumored to include curved glass casing, an edge-to-edge display with minimal or no bezels, and built-in wireless charging.
