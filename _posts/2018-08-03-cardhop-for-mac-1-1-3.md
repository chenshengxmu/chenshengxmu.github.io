* Trust me, Cardhop is the only contacts app for your Mac that you’ll actually want to use a regular basis. In its latest incarnation, Cardhop brings support for Instagram as a social profile type in the contact fields, plus drag and drop improvements and other updates.
* Next, you can now drag your selected contact from Cardhop and drop it onto another app’s window, like Pages or TextEdit. Doing so will drop the contact name and a link to the contact.
* If you like to browse your contacts visually and have painstakingly added profile pics to your most important people in Contacts, you’ll be pleased to learn that selecting a contact picture from a file will now show options to crop the picture.

* Another great shortcut: pressing Return when a contact is selected will now begin editing the contact. They’ve also added an option to skip already used labels when printing a sheet of labels and fixed an issue when using Skype to call phone numbers without a country code.
* Today’s update is provided at no additional charge to existing users.
