* Jeff Bezos, co-founder and CEO of Amazon, has managed to surpass Bill Gates on Thursday morning to become the world’s richest person in terms of net worth.
* According to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Bezos’s net worth has climbed more than $1 billion in intraday trading thanks to a surge in Amazon shares Thursday morning in advance of the company’s earnings report.
* It was enough to propel Bezos past Bill Gates as the world’s richest person. Bill Gates has held the top spot on Bloomberg’s wealth index since 2013.
* The company has surged 40 percent this year through Wednesday, helping to add $24.5 billion to Bezos’s net worth. Bezos owns about seventeen percent of Amazon.
* At the start of 2017, the Amazon CEO was the world’s fourth-wealthiest person and has since leapfrogged Inditex SA founder Amancio Ortega, who ranks third with $82.7 billion, and Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, who ranks fourth at $74.5 billion.
* Amazon is expected to post quarterly revenue of $37.2 billion, a 22 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and earnings per share of $1.42.
