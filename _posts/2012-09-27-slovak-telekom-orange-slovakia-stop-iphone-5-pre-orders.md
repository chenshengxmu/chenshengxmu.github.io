* With less than 24 hours until the second phase of global iPhone roll-out, some carriers have stopped taking pre-orders for the device due to low supply. Over in Slovakia, carriers Slovak Telekom and Orange Slovakia stopped taking pre-orders amid widespread supply constraints, reports The Wall Street Journal.
* Furthermore, I’ve just checked with the nine global Apple Stores that currently sell the iPhone 5 and nearly all of them still quote 2-3 week delivery estimate, suggesting that Apple is selling iPhones as fast as it can make them. Folks around the world are obviously getting fed up with the iPhone…
* Leos Rousek, writing for The Journal:
* “In the end, we’ve decided against taking pre-orders because of low delivery volumes from the supplier,” Slovak Telekom spokesman Michal Korec said. “We’ll begin selling iPhone 5 tomorrow morning during regular opening hours of our stores.”
* Both Slovak Telekom operates under Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile brand. Orange Slovakia, a unit of France Telecom SA, is the country’s second-largest carrier.
* The Czech and Slovak units of Spain’s Telefonica SA are at odds with Apple over terms of sale (read: high iPhone subsidy) and reportedly have no plans to sell the iPhone 5 at their retail stores, though the Czech unit of Telefonica will offer discounted calling plans to customers who bring in their own device bought from Czech Apple Stores.
* Back in the United States, regional operators Cricket, C Spire, GCI, Bluegrass Cellular, nTelos Wireless and Appalachian Wireless will sell discounted iPhone 5 beginning tomorrow. For example, nTelos Wireless will be offering the entry-level sixteen gigabyte version of the iPhone 5 for just $149 with a two-year contract.
* The iPhone 5 launches in 22 new countries tomorrow: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
* Did you plan on standing in line or pre-ordering?
