* The music discovery engine Shazam has been on a roll lately. May brought an exclusive background television-tagging features to Shazam for iPad and last month the company added a new Pulse feature to ease music discovery by analyzing the trending real-time charts. In today’s update, your Shazam apps have received another useful feature: multi-track purchase…
* As the name suggests, this features allows you to buy multiple tagged songs through iTunes. Just go to the My Tags section (Favorites on iPad) and tap Select & Buy.
* You’ll be able to select multiple tagged songs before hitting the Buy button to purchase them in one go through iTunes.
* Sweet!
* Other changes in Shazam version 6.2 include a useful improvement to discover music based on similar tracks other Shazamers have bought. Just tag a song or access your previously tagged music in My Tags and hit the new Recommendations button.
* There are more previews available for tagged music and trending songs in the Pulse charts, meaning less back and forth between Shazam and iTunes/YouTube.
* The application now makes it “easier to tweet and share on Facebook, or to e-mail music and TV results”.
* Oh, and Shazam for iPhone now features improved voiceover support.
* The free Shazam and the premium Shazam Encore are available on iOS and Android devices through Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store (Shazam, Shazam Encore).
* Since the release of Shazam 6.0, the iPhone/iPad has been a universal iOS binary so now’s a good time to replace your outdated Shazam for iPad build with the universal binary.
