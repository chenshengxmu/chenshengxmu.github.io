* Those of you who have been jailbreaking for a while will undoubtedly know George “GeoHot” Hotz, the guy who brought to us the very first iPhone unlock, back in 2008. Since then, GeoHot developed several jailbreaks, including purplera1n, blackra1n, and limera1n.
* Then in 2011, GeoHot was sued by Sony for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3. The matter was quickly settled out of court, and GeoHot started working for Facebook shortly after.
* Things are moving along for GeoHot though. According to Business Insider, he recently quit his position at Facebook. So what is he doing now?
* It’s not clear what GeoHot is up to these days, but he was spotted at a hackthon where he competed with a bunch of other people on developing an app. He didn’t win, but that’s not really important.
* What’s important here is that GeoHot might be back in the scene, and who knows, he might even be already working on discovering new exploits.
* We’ll be sure to let you know if we hear anything new coming from him, so stay tuned!
* In the meantime, watch GeoHot at the hackathon mentioned above (sorry Flash only – not our fault)
