* A one-of-a-kind Mac Pro is scheduled to go up for auction by Sotheby’s next month. Designed by Apple senior vice president of design Jony Ive and friend Marc Newson, the red, aluminum-clad Mac is expected to sell for as much as $60,000.
* The two designers have teamed up on a number of other one-off products for Sotheby’s upcoming benefit. And the proceeds from these and other items will go to Product (RED), a long-time Apple partner that fights AIDS and other diseases…

* Beyond the red paint, the machine should look fairly familiar. It features the same cylindrical design as this year’s big Mac Pro model, which will go on sale in December starting at $2,999. Sotheby’s estimates this one will go for $40k to $60k.
* At that price, we’d hope the specs would be maxed out on this thing, giving it 12-core Xeon E5 processors, AMD FirePro D700 GPUs, 64 GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. But I guess if you’re paying $60k for a computer, performance is trivial.

* Some of Jony and Marc’s other one-off creations include a Leica M camera, an anodized aluminum desk, and a pair of solid rose gold EarPods. All of these items are set to be auctioned off on Saturday November 23rd, at an event in New York.
