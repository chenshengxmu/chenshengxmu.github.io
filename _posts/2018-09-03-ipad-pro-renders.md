* In recent days, we’ve seen images leaked purportedly showing the 2018 iPhone XS and fourth-generation Apple Watch. We now seeing CAD-based image and video renders for the upcoming third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, courtesy of MySmartPrice. These renderings, based Onleaks sources, suggest we’re about to see the first significant design change for the Apple iPad in a long time. 
* As you can see, the tablet no longer contains a Home button thanks to its smaller bezels. However, these bezels aren’t nearly as small as the ones found on the iPhone X. Because of this, the 2018 iPad Pro lineup probably won’t include a notch, even though it will offer Face ID and a True-Depth camera.
* It’s also important to note that the charging port remains at the bottom middle of the device. Despite this, there’s no longer a 3.5mm headphone jack. What we do see, however, are four speaker grills at each corner and a power button at the right-hand corner. Additionally, the volume buttons remain on the right-hand side of the device.

* Interestingly, there’s a “strange button-like artifact” located on the same side that “even @OnLeaks could not figure out what it was.”
* Finally, there’s the Smart Connector which is now round right above the charging part. MySmartPrice explains, “When you are mounting your iPad Pro on a Smart Keyboard Cover, it looks as if buyers will need to place it vertically, and the reason for that might be because the tablet cannot get unlocked via Face ID while in landscape mode.”
* Take a look:
* The specs presented here match up nicely with previous rumors that suggest Apple’s planning on introducing an all-new 11-inch iPad Pro this year alongside a third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Both tablets are expected to ditch the Home button and include thinner bezels. In recent weeks, there was also a rumor that said the Smart Connector was being moved on both devices.
* Last week, Apple announced it would be holding a press event on Wednesday, Sept. 12. The presentation is likely to see the introduction of three new iPhones and a fourth-generation Apple Watch. Apple could also announce new iPad Pro tablets at this event or delay the launch until later in the year.
