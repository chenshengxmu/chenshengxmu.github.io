* If you haven’t upgraded to iOS 8.4, it’s now too late. Apple has closed the iOS 8.4 signing window according to IPSW.me. It’s now impossible to upgrade or downgrade to iOS 8.4. All users are now forced to iOS 8.4.1 or higher upon restore.
* Fortunately, it seems as if most people heeded our warnings when it came to getting back on iOS 8.4 before the signing window closed. If you didn’t, and you’re not already on iOS 8.4 or other jailbreakable firmware, you’ll need to wait until an iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak is released or an iOS 9 jailbreak is released.
* Last night, it was reported that the Pangu team has accomplished an iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak, but the likelihood of it seeing the light of day is slim. Instead, it’s more likely that the Pangu team is holding its cards for the possibility of an iOS 9 jailbreak instead.
* If you’re currently on iOS 8.4, be sure to stay there and don’t upgrade to iOS 8.4.1 or later. If you want to restore your device, you can always use Cydia Impactor, a tool that lets you restore iOS and remain on the same firmware.
* This really does appear to be the final nail in the coffin for the iOS 8.3/iOS 8.4 era of jailbreaks. Thankfully, there is a spark of hope for the future with Pangu’s recent achievements.
* Are you sad to see the signing window for iOS 8.4 closed?
