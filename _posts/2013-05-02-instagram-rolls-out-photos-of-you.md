* Good news, iPhone photography lovers! Facebook-owned Instagram has issued an update to its iOS and Android client today, introducing a new Photos of You feature – another way to share and discover stories on Instagram, basically a dedicated profile section which collects photos you’ve been tagged in.
* As part of the roll-out, Instagram said users can now tag people as easily as you add hashtags. What’s more, you can even tag any account on Instagram, “whether it’s your best friend, favorite coffee shop or even that adorable dog you follow”. They also created a nice promo video to promote the feature, jump past the fold to watch it…
* According to the Instagram blog, only you can tag folks in your photos and you’ll receive a notification when someone tags you in their photo.
* Here’s the promo.
* You can also open someone’s web site, if any, in Safari by tapping on the link in their Instagram bio.

* Like Facebook, Instagram’s web interface now has a new Photos of You profile section.
* New controls have been added so you can tell Instagram not to put the photos you’ve been tagged in on your profile until you approve them.
* Before your Photos of You section is visible to other people, you’ll have until May 16 to play around and get used to the feature.
* More information about Photos of You is available via Instagram’s help resources.
* Instagram mobile apps have been updated with support for the new Photos of You section, a new Report a Problem feature and a slight tweak moving privacy settings to your Profile screen, just under the Edit Your Profile section.
* Instagram 3.5 is available free on the App Store and Google’s Play store for Android.
