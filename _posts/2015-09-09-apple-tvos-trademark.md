* With just a few hours until Apple’s keynote, a series of trademark filings for the name ‘tvOS’ have been discovered by MacRumors, indicating that the Apple TV’s new operating system will indeed be referred to as ‘tvOS’, which would be in line with the naming convention for iOS and watchOS platforms.
* Apple appears to have protected the trademark via a shell corporation, as is its usual modus operandi when it wants to hide trademark filings from general public.
* Other hints have been discovered which point to ‘tvOS’ being the official name for the next Apple TV’s software platform. According to iGeneration (Google Translate), references to ‘tvOS’ were also spotted within Apple’s iTunes Connect service for developers.
* The trademarks were made in mid-to-late May in a number of countries by a company called Television OnStream LLC, a Delaware shell corporation created just days earlier.
* “In another similarity to Apple’s previous trademark patterns, Television OnStream LLC conveniently shortens to an acronym of “tvOS”, much as Apple previously hid its “iPad” trademark behind a company named IP Application Development,” the publication writes.

* The ‘tvOS’ trademarks refer to a November 2014 filing made in Jamaica, a frequent location for Apple’s initial filings.
