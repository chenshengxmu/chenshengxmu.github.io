* The iPhone 7 won’t feature a camera bump or antenna lines on its rear casing, reports MacRumors. Citing a source who has “provided reliable information in the past,” the outlet says the smartphone is going to appear similar in design to the iPhone 6s, except for these changes.
* For the camera bump, it appears Apple will use a thinner camera module for the iPhone 7’s iSight camera that will allow the lens to sit flush with the back-casing. The iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to feature a dual-lens camera, so it’s unknown if it will retain the rear bump or not.
* As for the antenna lines, the report says that Apple has figured out an antenna system that will no longer require the lines to stripe across the iPhone’s rear casing. This will allow a more seamless design, although the bands on the side and across the top and bottom will stay.
* It’s believed Apple will unveil the iPhone 7 at an event in September, as it has done in recent years. Other rumors for the device include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, waterproofing, and wireless charging—although a recent report claims that feature may not show up until 2017.
