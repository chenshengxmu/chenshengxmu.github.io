* TeeVee 3, a TV show-tracking app that I reviewed in May by Tomas Perzl of the Czech Republic and Slovakia-based CrazyApps Team, now lets you tweet out upcoming episodes or mark the ones you’ve seen as watched, directly from the notification itself, and also see which shows are coming next in the Today view of the iOS Notification Center, thanks to its iOS 8-focused update released yesterday.
* Other new features available in this excellent iPhone and iPad app include new sorting options (Alphabetically, Reverse, AirDate and Unwatched), the ability to delete a show by long-pressing it in the list and several bug fixes.
* As a cherry on top, the team has decided to discount the $2.99 app to zero bucks, for a limited time, in an effort to bring in new customers. If you’re going to grab the latest TeeVee 3.1 update, please keep in mind that the app now requires iOS 8.
* Here’s TeeVee’s Today widget in action.

* Don’t forget that you must first enable the widget by tapping the Edit button down in the Notification Center and flipping the ‘TeeVee’ switch to ON.
* And this is an example of TeeVee’s interactive notifications, right on the Lock screen. Sweet, no?

* As I wrote in my review, this finely-done digital TV shows guru lets you track any of the more than 30,000 TV shows in its database.
* The app syncs with iCloud and Trakt, features a clean look (especially on the iPad) with swipe-based navigation, push notifications when your favorite shows are set to air in your local time zone and much more.
* TeeVee 3.1 changelog:
* Unlike other apps that go free only to ask you for cash later, TeeVee 3 does not contain In-App Purchases at all. However, better hurry up because the $0 price is good for a limited time only.
* TeeVee 3.1 for iOS 8 is FREE for a limited time. https://t.co/IU6RortGlv
