* AT&T launched a new home phone and Internet service this week, which relies on the carrier’s LTE and HSPA networks. The service works through a modem (free with a two-year contract) that needs only a power outlet and decent AT&T coverage to work.
* The carrier refers to the new offering as its “Wireless Home Phone and Internet service,” and it runs $20 a month for the phone, and $60 per month for Internet. That’s only for 10GB though—you’ll pay as much as $120 for 30GB, and $10 for every GB over…
* AT&T says that the wireless modem can supply Internet service for up to 10 devices via Wi-Fi, and can be used with customers’ existing wired telephones. And it’s completely portable, allowing you to use it wherever the carrier provides HSPA and LTE service.
* Speaking of which, it’s worth noting that AT&T currently has the second largest LTE network in the US, next to Verizon, and it’s consistently been proven to be the fastest. The carrier also says it’s the most reliable, but the folks over at Big Red vehemently disagree.

* As for Verizon, it offers a similar product called HomeFusion Broadband. It only works with the carrier’s LTE network, though, and it only supports data connections—no voice calling. It’s pricing tier is the same as AT&T’s, ranging from $60 per month to $120.
* This isn’t the first time we’ve seen AT&T pitch a wireless services like this, and it won’t be the last. But I’m still not bought into the idea yet. While the LTE at my house is usually faster than my broadband Internet, I couldn’t deal with a 10GB or 20GB monthly cap.
* According to FierceWireless, the service is now available in Baltimore, Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, Virginia, Washington D.C. and other East Coast locations. And AT&T plans to eventually rollout the two products to the rest of its wireless footprint.

* I use Netflix, Xbox Live and way to many other services to go with something like this. How about you?
