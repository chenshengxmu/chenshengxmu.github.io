* Apple on Tuesday released the fifth betas of iOS 11.2, tvOS 11.2, and macOS 10.13.2. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* iOS 11.2 features support for Apple Pay Cash and SiriKit for HomePod (which has been delayed until next year), but outside of that there aren’t many user-facing changes. Here’s our hands-on video with the beta.

* tvOS 11.2 improves the media experience for owners of the just-released Apple TV 4K by adding the ability to match the native frame rate and dynamic range of your content. This makes games and other GPU-accelerated content look better, and the new option can be found in Settings.
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 appears to be largely a maintenance release as well, with few notable user-facing changes. One small tiny change worth noting is that this update brings support for Apple’s new introductory pricing option for developers of subscription apps.
* We’re currently installing today’s betas, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
