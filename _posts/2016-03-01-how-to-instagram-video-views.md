* Instagram has long relied on ‘Likes’ to quantify how popular your posts are, making it easy to see if that photo or video you posted is gaining any traction at all. While likes are great, they don’t quite tell the whole story when it comes to video posts.
* Liking a video clip doesn’t necessarily mean a person has watched it so this is not the best stat to measure the level of your followers’ engagement with your Instagram videos.
* As of today, these worries are a thing of the past as Instagram’s newly updated iPhone app now makes it easy to see how many people viewed your videos on the service.
* 1) Open the Instagram app on your iPhone.
* 2) Scroll through your feed until you encounter a video. Now look right below a video post to see how many people viewed it. As mentioned, video views help you better understand how people are engaging with your videos on Instagram.

* Tip: If you also want to check out who liked a video post, tap on video view counts and you’ll be taken to a listing of people who have liked that post.
* Note that video views require Instagram for iOS version 7.17.1 or later.
* Download Instagram free in the App Store.
