* The award-winning endless snowboard odyssey, Alto’s Adventure, turned two yesterday. Today, Alto’s developer Snowman gave us a first look at the game’s official sequel, Alto’s Odyssey. In Odyssey, players are challenged to discover the secrets of the endless desert.
* By the way, they’re commemorating the Alto’s Adventure anniversary by bringing the game’s price down from $4.99 to just $1.99, ending today. Alto’s Odyssey is coming in summer 2017 and we’ll be sure to update you as more information becomes available.
* In the meantime, be sure to watch a teaser trailer for subtle hints about game mechanics, crisp graphics and flawless execution.
* Here’s a teaser trailer for Alto’s Odyssey.
* As we previously told you, the Snowman team actually started working on an idea and basic concepts for Alto’s Odyssey long before Alto’s Adventure had even been released.
* Some of the other projects that Snowman has been working on in partnership with other developers include Distant, an atmospheric platform game focused on the “elegance of movement,” and Where Cards Fall, a puzzle-based game described as a “dreamlike journey through youthful uncertainty.”
