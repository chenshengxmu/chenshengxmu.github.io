* Yeah, it’s on. Let the cat fight begin! Now that Verizon is getting the iPhone, Apple is trying to downplay the differences between the 2 carriers with sweet commercials reminding us that the network doesn’t matter. But because Apple is playing nice doesn’t mean the 2 carriers have to play nice.
* Today AT&T sent emails to some of their customers with the subject line “Feel free to make a call while reading this email”. The email goes on saying that “only AT&T’s network lets you talk and surf the web at the same time on your iPhone”…
* This is clearly an attack at Verizon whose CDMA iPhone will not allow you to be on a call while surfing the internet. While this is a minor issue, especially for those who are already on Verizon and used to this, it is yet another angle AT&T can exploit to softly mock Verizon.
* I’m sure there is more to come. From both sides.
* Thoughts?
