* Fairly reliable website Mac Otakara is reporting that Apple will be holding a media event next month to announce hardware updates for several of its popular products. Wondering what’s on tap for a refresh? According to the Japanese publication, Apple will add a new 128-gigabyte iPhone SE model to the existing 16GB and 64GB capacities.
* In addition, we should also see the previously rumored Red model of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and four new iPad Pro models introduced at the event.
* Mac Otakara corroborated previous report, saying the new iPad Pros will come in four screen sizes: 7.9, 9.7, 10.5-inch and 12.9 inches, suggesting the 7.9-inch iPad Pro could become Apple’s new entry-level iPad possibly replacing the 7.9-inch iPad mini 4 models.
* Prior rumors predicted that the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model would be roughly the same size as the current 9.7-incher because it would have skinnier side bezels, an edge-to-edge display and no physical Home button. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro may not begin shipping until May, according to the publication’s sources.

* Last but not least, the rumored event should bring us a range of new Spring-themed Apple Watch bands. We’ll know more about these claimed product refreshes at the end of March, when Apple is said to be holding its media event.
