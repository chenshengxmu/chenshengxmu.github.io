* I’m a sucker for a good product concept, and as such, Claudio Gomboli has captured my heart and mind with a smart accessory that turns the front of your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus into an iPod Classic.
* Gomboli’s concept brings back the old school click-wheel that we all know so well from the classic iPods. It turns the app and feature filled iPhone 6 into a slimmed down user interface with quick access to Music, Podcasts, and more like an iPod Classic.
* The point of the concept is to save users the hassle of having to open their phone to change music. While of course music skipping can be done from the iOS 8 home screen, this is pretty rad. It slaps on just like Apple’s Smart Cover for the iPad with premium leather.
* Of course, this isn’t coming to market – just some imagination at work. Apple designers should definitely take note.
* [Claudio Gomboli] Thanks for the tip, Brad!
