* In older versions of iTunes, you could easily open a playlist in a separate window. It was both a great time-saver and a boon to your productivity, especially on large screens.
* For reasons unknown, Apple has removed that functionality from the iTunes 12 update which was overhauled around a single-window workflow.
* Thankfully, the company has reinstated the ability to open playlists in new windows with iTunes 12.6. Here’s how to open your playlists in their separate windows using iTunes for Mac.
* 1) Launch iTunes on your Mac.
* 2) Choose Music from the menu near the upper-left corner, then click the Library tab.

* 3) In the lefthand column, right-click or Control (⌃)-click your playlist underneath the All Playlists heading, then select the option Open In New Window from the popup menu.

* This will open a new iTunes window containing the selected playlist, as shown top of post.
* You can drag songs at will between the playlist windows and open as many playlists in separate windows as you like. I don’t have that many playlists created in iTunes so I was able to open “only” four playlist windows, but it worked like a charm.
* Playlists on Apple Music cannot be opened in their separate windows unless they’re in your iTunes library. To do so, follow the steps below:
* 1) Launch iTunes on your Mac.
* 2) Choose Music from the popup menu near the upper-left corner of the window, then click either the Library or the For You tab.
* 3) Find a playlist on Apple Music and click the three dots in the lower-right corner of playlist graphics to bring up the contextual menu, then choose the option Add to Library.

* 4) With the selected Apple Music playlist now in your iTunes library, switch to the Library tab, right-click it underneath the Apple Music Playlists heading in the lefthand column, then select the Open in New Window command.

* Just like that, the selected Apple Music playlist from your library opens in a new window.
* Sadly, playlists windows in iTunes don’t support macOS’s useful Split View feature.
* If iTunes supported Split View properly, it could have been a great multitasking feature. In other words, you cannot browse your iTunes library in the main window and have your favorite playlist in its separate window in macOS’s Split View mode.
