* Aside from seeding iOS 10.3 beta 3 to members of the Apple Developer Program, Apple this morning released a third beta of both watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 for developer testing as well. watchOS 3.2 beta 3 (build 14V5224d) and tvOS 10.2 beta 3 (build 14W5241c) are both available over the air via Software Update.
* Control Center toggles have been reordered slightly in beta 3.
* Also released today: beta 3 of iOS 10.3 with a new App Compatibility list and macOS Sierra 10.12.4.
* watchOS 3.2 brings a new Theater Mode to Apple Watch.
* Invoked via a toggle in Control Center, Theater Mode puts the device into silent mode while keeping the screen dark until you hit one of the buttons, or the screen.
* According to Apple:
* Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown.
* Aside from Theater Mode, watchOS 3.2 will let you control your favorite watch apps with Siri so you can accomplish things like send a message, make a payment, book a ride, start a workout, call a contact or search photos just by using your voice.

* Apple says that tvOS 10.2 beta 3 brings improved scrolling behavior allowing you to scroll through really long lists more quickly than before.
* To use improved scrolling on tvOS 10.2 beta 3, simply do a large swipe on your Siri Remote, then swipe on the far right side to navigate specific indexes.
* Here’s how Apple describes accelerated scrolling:
* Scroll views with a lot of content now have a behavior that allows users to scroll through them much more quickly. Several large swipes of the Siri remote will automatically switch into this mode. Additionally, users can swipe on the far right side of the remote to navigate specific indexes. If you see any unexpected behavior in your applications from this feature, please file a bug report.
* Aside from accelerated scrolling support, tvOS 10.2 brings support for Apple’s Device Enrollment Program, Expanded Mobile Device Management, the VideoToolbox framework and the new Apple File System (APFS).
* Betas of watchOS and tvOS are unavailable to public beta testers.
