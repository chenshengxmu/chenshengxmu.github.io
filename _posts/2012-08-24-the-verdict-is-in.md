* The ongoing legal battle between the world’s two largest phone manufacturers isn’t anything new. For over a year now, both companies have been fighting on the marketplace, but also in the courtroom.
* But things have been seriously heating up the last couple weeks with what is probably the most watched trial ever in the tech world, as both Samsung and Apple accuse each other of patent infringement.
* And after 21 hours of deliberation, the jury has finally reached a decision…
* And the verdict is, Samsung has been found guilty of infringing on several patents owned by Apple (via The Verge).
* And now for the damages — what the jury feels Samsung owes Apple based on all of its patent infringements:
* The total amount of damages Samsung will be forced to pay is $1,051,855,000. Wow. Here’s the break down.
* Apple didn’t win every claim, but this is certainly a major victory for the company. Now that all of its major trade dress and design patents have been proven valid, it can use them and this verdict to fight off future copycats. One thing is for sure, if you were thinking about implementing one of Apple’s ideas into one of your products before, you aren’t now.
* Not a bad way for Tim Cook to celebrate his one year anniversary, is it?
