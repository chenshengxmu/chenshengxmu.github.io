* WhatsApp Messenger is one of the most popular third-party messaging platforms used on the iOS platform today, but there are countless ways it could be improved.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak called ABetterPrivacyforWhatsApp, iOS developer CydiaGeek provides jailbroken WhatsApp Messenger users with the means of customizing their experience, allowing for better privacy and aesthetics in the app.
* Once installed, ABetterPrivacyforWhatsApp adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can tinker with a plethora of options until you’re satisfied:

* Here, you can:
* The long list of options gives the end user a fair amount of customization. While some options are more useful than others, the inclusion of every option this tweak offers increases its appeal to a larger user base.
* I don’t use WhatsApp Messenger myself, but if I did, I’d probably disable read receipts and hide status indicators from my recipient because I find non-customizable features like these to be a nuisance to my privacy in messaging apps. The dark keyboard would have to be my favorite aesthetic option, but your mileage may vary, as everyone has a different opinion when it comes to cosmetics.
* If you’re interested in trying ABetterPrivacyforWhatsApp for yourself, the tweak is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9 and 10 devices. More importantly, it works with version 2.17.52 of the WhatsApp Messenger app, which is a free download from the App Store if you’re not already using it.
