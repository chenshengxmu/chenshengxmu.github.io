* If you remember my Sparrow review, I said it was a great app that was marred by a few missing features — namely: push notification capability, and the ability to make Sparrow the default Mail app.
* In due time the folks at Sparrow will undoubtedly solve the push notification issue, and a few enterprising iOS jailbreak devs have already taken the liberty on that issue as well.
* One feature that’s not so easy to implement is making Sparrow iOS’ default mail client. In fact, unless Apple does a virtual 180 on its current stance, this will never be a feature of Sparrow, or any other 3rd party Email app for that matter.
* The only hope to implement such functionality rests with the jailbreak community. In fact, I reached out to iOS developer Majd Alfhaily yesterday, and he graciously accepted my request for such a feature in his upcoming jailbreak tweak coined: Sparrow+.
* Want to see it in action? Have a look…
* As stated, Sparrow+ consists of two primary features:
* We’ve seen Sparrow Push notifications before, and they work just as one would expect. In fact, rather than reinvent the wheel, Alfhaily uses Sparrow Push as a dependency for his tweak.
* Since we’ve seen push notifications with Sparrow before, and we know that a solution is coming from Sparrow themselves in this regard, this feature takes a back burner to the much more important default mail app function. For me, that’s always been a deal breaker for me regarding Sparrow. As it stands, Sparrow can’t function as my default client if the Mail app is always opening whenever I tap a link to compose a new mail.
* Fortunately for jailbroken iPhone users, Sparrow+ solves this problem. It’s not 100% perfect just yet, but it solves about 85% of the issue. Currently, it works like a charm when tapping mailto links from websites, from within apps, etc.
* The only downside thus far is that it doesn’t play nice with iOS’ new mail sheet function. This causes features like the “Tell a Friend” button in the App Store app to remain reliant on the stock Mail client.
* The good news is that the developer is actively working on making Sparrow+ work in every scenario imaginable, which would totally make one forget that the stock Mail app ever existed.
* Do you use Sparrow currently? If not, does this tweak do enough to make you consider the switch? Let us know what you think about Sparrow+ in the comments below. It should be available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo in the very near future.
* Sparrow can be downloaded from the App Store for $2.99.
* Update: The Sparrow Push dependency has been removed, and now Sparrow+ performs all functions on its own.
