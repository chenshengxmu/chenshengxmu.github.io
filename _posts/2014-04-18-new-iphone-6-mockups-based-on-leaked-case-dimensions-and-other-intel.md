* Well-known designer and concept artist Martin Hajek has teamed up with the folks over at Nowhereelse.fr to create what could be the most accurate iPhone 6 renderings to date. The mockups show a device that was created based on recent information, including MacFan’s schematic drawing from last month, and this week’s case leak.
* For the most part, the renderings match up with everything we’ve seen thus far regarding Apple’s next smartphone. Hajek depicts the iPhone 6 as extremely thin, with rounded corners, and a display that’s noticeably larger than current models. It also features a new Sleep/Wake button, which has been moved to the right side of the handset…

* Here’s Nowhereelse.fr’s Steve Hemmerstoffer with more:
* On March 31, I asked my friend Martin Hajek to model future iPhone 6 based on supposed sketches that were sent to me by one of my Chinese sources. Two weeks later, I published photos of protective shells supposedly designed by a Chinese props to protect this future California smartphone. These shots in turn inspired the talented Dutch designer.
* We first heard that Apple was going to be relocating the Sleep/Wake button on the iPhone 6 from Ming-Chi Kuo. The KGI Securities’ analyst issued a research note to investors last week saying the Cupertino company is going to be moving the button from the top of the handset, to the side, to help ease one-handed use of the larger handset.
* Additionally, note that the above image shows a round single-LED flash on the back of the iPhone 6 rendering, instead of the current pill-shaped design. This is also something we have seen before, in both MacFan’s schematic and a purported iPhone 6 ‘dummy unit,’ and it’s possible Apple has reached a new milestone in LED flash tech.
* iPhone 5s next to 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6

* That about does it for external changes. As for internal differences, it sounds like the iPhone will come in two sizes: 4.7 and 5.5-inches, as depicted in the image above. We’ve seen various theories about their resolutions, but Kuo is calling for 1334×740 and 1920×1080 respectively, coming in at 401 ppi (or pixels per inch) on the high end.
* Additionally, it’s believed that the iPhone 6 will feature a much faster A8 processor, an updated 8MP camera, and several other improvements. Mass production of the handset is expected to begin next month, ahead of a September launch, but it’s been reported that the 5.5-inch model will land a few months late due to manufacturing issues.

* Of course, none of this is concrete, and it all could change over the next several weeks. But for now, at least, it seems like we’re beginning to get some idea of what the next iPhone will look like. What do you think so far?
