* Joining a chorus of carrier updates, U.S. wireless carrier Sprint today revealed an unlimited plan of its own. Called Unlimited Freedom and available starting at $60 per month, it offers unlimited 4G LTE data, talk and text, with the ability to add a second line for an extra $40 per month, or up to eight lines for an additional $30 per month each.
* Additionally, Sprint’s prepaid subsidiary Boost Mobile revealed a similar plan of its own. Both plans are available for new and existing customers starting tomorrow.
* As you may have suspected, there is some fine print to consider:
* Unlike T-Mobile’s new $70 per month plan that lets people upgrade video quality to high-definition for an extra $25 per month, Sprint has not said whether it will offer a similar upgrade path for Unlimited Freedom.

* It’s also unclear if tethering is included in the plan.
* As evidenced by the promotional poster above, Sprint’s prepaid brand Boost Mobile has a matching unlimited plan, called Unlimited Unhook’d. Priced at $50 per month, it offers unlimited 4G LTE data, talk and text with the ability to add up to four additional lines for $30 per month each.
* Earlier today, T-Mobile announced a new $70 per month plan, called One, that offers unlimited 4G LTE data, talk and text, without data caps and overage charges. The service comes with the carrier’s usual perks, such as Simple Global, Mobile Without Borders, Wi-Fi Unleashed, Stock Up, T-Mobile Tuesdays and Carrier Freedom.
* Yesterday, rival AT&T announced more affordable data plans with no overage charges while Verizon launched pricier data plans with more data earlier in the summer.
* Unlimited plans came and went many times in the past. Some of these “unlimited” offerings come with significant caveats, like decreasing your cellular data speed drastically after a certain amount of data is spent.
* In the case of T-Mobile, as an example, customers using more than 26GB of 4G LTE data per month may see their data traffic prioritized to 3G or sluggish 2G (EDGE) speeds at specific times and places that the network sees high congestion.
* What do you think of Sprint’s latest unlimited offering?
