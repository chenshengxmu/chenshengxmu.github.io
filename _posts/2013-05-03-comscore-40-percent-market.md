* Looking at tech news headlines from the past few months, you’d think Apple was in trouble. And not just “we had an off quarter” trouble, but “is Apple the new Research in Motion” trouble. Some folks even think Tim Cook could lose his job.
* But looking at the bare numbers seems to suggest the exact opposite. The company just reported a record-breaking quarter. It has more than $130 billion in cash. And according to a new report, it has nearly 40% of the US smartphone market…
* Marketing research firm comScore is out with its rolling monthly report—which measures the mobile device landscape in the US—this afternoon, and the results may surprise you: Apple is dominating the field right now with 39% of US smartphones.

* That’s nearly double the share of its closest competitor, Samsung, who accounted for 21% of the market last quarter. And the usual suspects—HTC, Motorola and LG—took the last 3 spots with 9%, 8.5%, and 6.8% respectively. All down since the last report.
* Of course, Apple doesn’t enjoy this type of success everywhere. Major markets like China and India, where prepaid plans are predominate, are still run by cheaper handsets. And that’s one of the main reasons why folks are calling for a budget iPhone.
* But here in the US, Apple’s handsets are clearly still dominating. And it doesn’t look like that’s going to stop anytime soon. The Cupertino company is expected to debut its next-generation flagship smartphone, the iPhone 5S, in the next few months.
* What do you make of comScore’s latest report?
