* With rumors circulating that the flagship feature of the iPhone 4S, Siri, is being ported to older iDevices by jailbreak hackers, many are wondering if Apple will ever bring Siri to its other mobile devices.
* One Apple customer emailed Apple about bringing Siri to other devices via a special iOS build, and Apple responded by saying that, “we currently have no plans to support older devices.”
* According to an email forwarded to developer Michael Steeber, a customer sent Apple an email about bringing Siri to more iDevices. The message was then allegedly sent to Engineering at Apple, and the following response was given:
* Engineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue: Siri only works on iPhone 4S and we currently have no plans to support older devices.
* It’s not a surprise that Apple doesn’t plan on bringing Siri to other devices, but it’s reassuring to have official clarification.

* The statement that “Siri only works on iPhone 4S” is not necessarily true, as Siri has been fully demoed by hackers on the iPhone 4 and iPod touch 4G. While porting Siri’s UI to non-4S devices is a relatively easy task, only a select few have been able to get Siri authenticated with Apple’s servers. The hackers that have successfully ported Siri have also said that the port cannot be distributed due to the illegal nature of copying Siri files to other devices.
