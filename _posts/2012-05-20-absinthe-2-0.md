title: The new iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak tool will likely be called Absinthe 2.0

* With the iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak right around the corner, work has apparently started on packaging the exploits into a tool that your average iOS device owner can utilize.
* Tools like GreenPois0n and RedSn0w take 99% of the guess work out of the jailbreaks, making it so that almost anyone can take advantage of the benefits that jailbreaking brings to the table.
* With that in mind, it’s no surprise that the highly anticipated 5.1.1 jailbreak will follow the same pattern. Judging from a conversation I had with an iOS hacker close to pod2g, it appears that the latest jailbreak tool in the pipeline will retain the Absinthe name.
* In other words, I’d say it’s totally reasonable to expect an Absinthe 2.0 iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak sometime within the next few days…
* I have my new bootrom 3gs jailbroken untethered on iOS 5.1.1 thanks to the new Absinthe v2.0-rc1. I’m currently testing with iPhone4…

* As you can see from his tweet above, iOS hacker @xvolks is currently knee deep in the testing process with Absinthe 2.0 — the tool that will apparently accomplish the iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak.
* This bodes well for ease of use, as the original Absinthe tool produced by the Chronic Dev Team was about as simple as simple gets. I’m not saying that the process will be the same as it was with the original Absinthe, I’m just saying that we can expect the Chronic Dev Team to do like they always do, and ship a product that is simple and straightforward.
* Of course none of this is 100% in stone until we see a release within the next few days. But I think this is a good indication as to what you can expect.
* Are you getting anxious?
