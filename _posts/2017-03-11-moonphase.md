* One of the features that comes standard on the Apple Watch that doesn’t come on the iPhone is Moon phase tracking. This lets you keep track of the Moon, whether it’s getting a full or new Moon, or anything in between.
* If you’ve always wished your iPhone could do this too, you can use a new jailbreak tweak called MoonPhase by rainwolf. This will add a new icon to the right of the time in the Status Bar that reflects upon the current Moon phase.
* The icon is refreshed every time the clock changes, which on a stock device, is once every minute. The icon can be seen anywhere the time appears in the Status Bar, which includes inside apps and on the Home screen. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear on the Lock screen.
* The MoonPhase icon uses both black and white for its base colors out of the box, which makes it easy to distinguish against essentially any UI color. Because of the icon’s contrasting colors, and the small hairline border it has, it’s rare that you’re ever going to have trouble seeing it; even when the app’s UI is white.
* You can configure a couple of options in the MoonPhase preferences pane, which you’ll find in the Settings app following installation:

* Here, you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand and you can choose whether or not to use true colors, which is where the tweak tries to use a black and white color scheme to accurately depict what the Moon looks like outside. If you turn this off, it makes the crescent color the same as the Status Bar’s default text color and the rest of the icon becomes transparent instead of black.
* It’s worth mentioning that resprings aren’t required to save your changes, so when you adjust the options, you should notice them take effect in real time.
* MoonPhase is cool knickknack to have, but it’s not something I would consider a necessity. Nevertheless, since your Apple Watch can do this, why not add it to your iPhone too?

* You can download MoonPhase for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and it works on all jailbroken iOS 7-10 devices.
