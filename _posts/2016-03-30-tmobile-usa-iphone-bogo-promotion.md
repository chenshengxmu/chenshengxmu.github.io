* In time for the new iPhone SE, which lands on store shelves tomorrow, wireless carrier T-Mobile announced a new BOGO (Buy One Get One) promotion that gives qualifying Simple Choice postpaid customers half off any iPhone when they buy a second iPhone and add a line.
* Devices eligible for this promotion include all iPhones that the company currently stocks, including the new four-inch iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. Certified pre-owned iPhones are not eligible for this time-limited offer, which goes live on Thursday, March 31.
* “Starting 3/31, get half off any iPhone when you buy a second iPhone and add a line,” said the carrier. Customers must add a new line of qualifying postpaid service to their account, and one of the two new devices must be on this new line. The offer is limited to two rebates per account.
* The rebate is provided in the form of a prepaid MasterCard. Rebate redemption must be submitted within 30 days of the purchase of your second iPhone. The promotion will be available at all T-Mobile-branded retail locations, Customer Care, Telesales and online.
* T-Mobile kindly included in this promotion those who have already pre-ordered their iPhone SE.
* “If you pre-ordered an iPhone SE on an Equipment Installment Plan (EIP), you may add a line to your account and purchase another one on EIP and, if you meet the requirements, you will be eligible for the rebate,” said the company.
* If you cancel wireless service, remaining EIP balance on both phones becomes due. If you cancel your added line of service before July 15, 2016, the total rebate amount may be billed to your account.
* Note that this offer cannot be combined with T-Mobile’s JUMP! On Demand early upgrade program. On the plus side, the carrier will cover up to $650 in switching costs if you decide to switch to them and take advantage of this BOGO iPhone deal.
* To track your online rebate and check the status of your promotion, go to t-mobile.com/promotions and use the Promotion Status link in the upper left-hand corner.
* To pre-order your iPhone SE, visit the T-Mobile website or call 1-877-413-5903.
