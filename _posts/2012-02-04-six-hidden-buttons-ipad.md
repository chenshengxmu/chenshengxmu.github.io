* The ability to split up the iPad’s keyboard is one of my favorite lesser-known features in iOS. I don’t use it all the time. But it really comes in handy when I need to rattle off an email or conjure up other large bodies of text.
* Apple obviously put a lot of thought into getting the split keyboard just the right size for its tablet, and it shows. In fact, there are even some elements of the keyboard that you can’t see. Did you know there are hidden keys on the iPad split keyboard?
* The iPad keyboard, when split in half, contains 6 hidden buttons. These phantom keys help prevent accidental mis-touches, and allow you to access the letters Y,H,B,T,G, and V without having to use your opposite hand.
* This isn’t the first time we’ve seen Apple play with virtual tap spaces in iOS. Last year we told you about how the Dictation mic, which is embedded into the keyboard, turns into an extension of the space bar when the international keyboard icon is active.
* These invisible design tweaks really speak to Apple’s attention to detail, and its focus on the user experience. To view the iPad’ split keyboard, simply place a finger on either side of the keyboard and drag it apart.
* Had you noticed these hidden iPad keys before?
