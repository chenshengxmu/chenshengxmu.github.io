* New MacBook Pros are still on for October, reports the often accurate Japanese site Mac Otakara. Citing a reliable source within Apple’s supply chain, the outlet says the long-awaited refresh of the premium notebook line is still on schedule for this month.
* In addition to the MacBook pro update, the site also says that the MacBook Air line is also getting a refresh. It expects Apple to drop the 11-inch model, to focus on the larger 13-inch version, and it will include USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports.
* Will the next MacBook Pro be released some time in October? Is the MacBook Air model having a complete replacement as well?
* According to information from a reliable Chinese supplier, Apple is planning to announce the new MacBook Pro within this month, and to begin shipping out to retailers in October.
* There has also been rumors that they are going to cancel MacBook Air of the 11-inch model, to focus on the 13-inch ones.
* Furthermore, it seems that they are also going to announce the new MacBook Pro at the same time, which will go on to replace the entire MacBook Pro series.
* It seems all of these models are developed with support for the USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports in mind, and will no longer be compatible with the USB-A connector, and the MagSafe 2 and Thunderbolt 2 ports.
* The rumor mill has been very consistent that Apple would introduce new Macs this month, including an all-new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar and Touch ID, but it’s now past mid-October and we’ve yet to hear anything substantive from Apple.
