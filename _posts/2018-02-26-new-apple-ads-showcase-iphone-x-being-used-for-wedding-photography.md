* In line with Apple’s regionally-focused advertising strategy, the company’s Australian branch has released a quarter of 15-second ads to their YouTube channel, highlighting the iPhone X camera being used at wedding ceremonies.
* And here they are.
* Some of the ads depict same-sex couples, a nod to the recent change in Australian law that has recognized same-sex marriage. Australia is the 25th country to pass marriage equality law.
* “Capture the moment, in the moment, on iPhone X,” reads the video’s description.
* All four ads are set to the same song, “Never Tear Us Apart” by Courtney Barnett
