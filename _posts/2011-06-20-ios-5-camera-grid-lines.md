title: New in iOS 5- Grid Lines in Camera App
---

* And we continue our exploration of new features in iOS 5. Today we’re looking at a new feature in the camera app that brings grid lines to the screen display. The grid lines are very helpful for getting the shot straight (horizon, edges of buildings, etc, can be used to ensure the camera is leveled).
* The grid lines can also be very helpful to “frame” the shot as the center is clearly visible, so offsetting any subject from the center (or not) becomes easier…
* To turn grid lines On and Off, simply tap the “Options” menu in your camera (see image above). I believe this is a useful feature that could have made its way to iOS years ago.
* How do you like that?
