* Following a handful of fatal electrocutions in China due to the use of unauthorized chargers, Apple unveiled a new USB Power Adapter Takeback Program earlier this month to “enable customers to acquire properly designed adapters.”
* The program, which allows folks to turn in their third-party adapters for recycling, or trade them in towards the purchase of an Apple-branded adapter, officially launched yesterday, and it’s now available in 30 countries around the globe…
* Here’s a list of the new countries and their respective trade-in values for third-party adapters (via 9to5Mac):

* Those looking to get a discounted charger must take their third-party USB power adapter along with an iOS device to an Apple Store or participating Authorized Service Provider. The special pricing is limited to one per device, and is valid until October 18, 2013.
* In addition to the above countries, Apple is also allowing customers to participate in the Takeback Program in Australia ($14 AUD), Canada ($11 CAD), France (10 €), Germany (10 €), Japan (￥1,000), and the United Kingdom (10 €).
