* Great news for potential iPhone 4S and iPad 2 jailbreakers. Infamous hacker pod2g confirmed a few minutes ago that significant progress has been made on the jailbreak, and we should except it in a week if all goes well.
* As you already are aware of, the untethered jailbreak for A4 devices, iPod touch, iPhone 4, etc. was released last week to much fanfare.
* Now the only thing left to do is release an A5 (iPad 2, and iPhone 4S) jailbreak for the full enchilada…
* I made a step today for the A5. With some luck we could expect a release in a week.

* pod2g has been an amazing force in the jailbreak community, and this solidifies him as one of the most valuable members the community has seen thus far. Recently it was noted that he handed off the development of the A4 jailbreak to work more exclusively on the difficult A5 jailbreak.
* It seems like it’s been forever since we had the first iPad 2 jailbreak, but a solution is literally right around the corner.
* Stay tuned for more updates. Are you ready to finally have Cydia on your iPhone 4S? What about you iPad 2 users? What will you do to celebrate when it finally arrives?
