* As I discussed in the recent episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak, I’ve been feverishly refreshing Apple’s iPhone 5s order page looking for a 32GB gold edition. Yes, I already have a Space Grey iPhone 5s, and I’m happy with it, but the rapper in me is secretly dying to get his paws on a gold version.
* Going to Apple’s website and constantly entering in my zip code to find in stock 5s’ in my local area gets to be a bit tedious. Thankfully, one smart individual has created a website that’s solely focused on retrieving iPhone 5s stock in your local area.

* The site, simply entitled iPhone Check, is a bare bones getup with little to no frills. It contains a place to enter in your local zip code, and two pull down boxes pertaining to the color and carrier.
* And no, before you ask, there’s still no Gold iPhone 5s in my area. What about yours?
