* Notification Center is far and away one of the top features of the new iOS 5, but it’s not without its opportunities for improvement.
* Case in point, you can only see four lines of text maximum on any of the messages that are queued up in Notification Center. There’s no way to customize the length of the messages that are displayed.
* There’s also the annoying matter of having to tap twice to clear out any messages. NotificationCenter Enhancer seeks to address these issues…
* In the video, I compare side-by-side my iPhone 4S iOS 5 installation, with my jailbroken iOS 5 installation running on my iPhone 4. With NotificationCenter enhancer, it’s entirely possible to read the full body of an email moderate in length, or an extra long text message.
* It’s also very nice to be able to clear out messages with one tap, instead of two.
* Want to try out NotificationCenter Enhancer for yourself? Head over to Cydia where you can download your own copy for $0.99.
* What do you think about the enhancements? Is there anything else you’d like to see added?
