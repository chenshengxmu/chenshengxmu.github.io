* Following up on this morning’s report of Apple’s plans for this year’s iPhone and iPad updates, iLounge has posted a new article with additional information. The intel comes from a ‘trusted source,’ and offers product code names and other specifics.
* The previous scoop claimed that the iPad 5 has been redesigned, with iPad mini-like bezels and size, and has a target date of October. Details of the iPhone 5S were less bountiful, but the site has now elaborated on it and added remarks on the new mini…
* On the iPhone 5S front, the publication says that there are two prototypes floating around, codenamed N51 and N53 respectively, with a targeted release date of July. And for what it’s worth, it says the iPad 5’s codename is J72, and it’s coming in October.
* “The iPhone 5S is still months away from mass production, but our source suspects that the star feature will be an upgraded rear camera—perhaps featuring Sony’s 13-Megapixel sensor, plus the aforementioned flash upgrade—along with a processor bump. Current prototypes are codenamed N51 and N53, with July mentioned as the target date.”
* Additionally, it says the new iPhone will look similar to the current model, but will include a few noteworthy changes including a processor bump, an upgraded rear camera, and a larger flash. The report mentions Sony’s 13MP sensor as a possible pick.
* As for the next-gen iPad mini, it has a code name of J85. And like the iPad 5, it’s expected to be released in October. The smaller tablet will reportedly look similar to its predecessor and house a Retina display, a feature that has been highly requested.
* We’ve heard some speculation that Apple was looking to launch its new iPad mini and iPhone in the spring of this year, but iLounge’s report does match up well with a report from KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo. And the two have fairly accurate track records.
* Obviously, all of this is considered rumor until it’s further corroborated (supply chain leaks, etc.), but it does some quite plausible. It’s also worth noting that earlier, iLounge said that its sources confirm that Apple has a cheaper, plastic iPhone in the pipeline.
