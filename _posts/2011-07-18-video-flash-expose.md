* It seems like Flash is slowly going the way of the betamax, depending on who you ask. While I myself don’t ever feel held back by the fact that my iPhone doesn’t support the platform, there are some folks that still feel it’s a downfall of the device.
* Heck, it seems like “supports Flash” is in nearly every Android phone and tablet commercial. Well, for iPhone users that still feel like they’re missing out on something, another Flash-compatible mobile browser has just entered the App Store…
* There’s already several 3rd party apps out there that deliver Flash content (mostly video) to iDevices, but none of them tout a feature set like Flash Video Expose:
* The app’s description also includes testimonials from satisfied customers that say things like, “Apple is going to be pissed when people start replacing Safari with Flash Video Expose.” So it must be good right?
* To be honest, I couldn’t part with the $9.99 they are asking from customers to find out. Especially after reading through a lot of the App Store comments. While the title has 3 stars (fair for 120 ratings), there were a lot of folks claiming that Flash Video Expose didn’t work at all.
* On top of that, many commenters claimed that the firm’s “24 hour customer service” is actually just a link to their Twitter page and a help video. I guess that can be considered 24 hour customer service.
* This situation highlights one of the App Store’s major downfalls: no app trial period. How could anyone be expected to pay $10+ dollars for something like this when they aren’t even sure that it will perform as advertised?
* If you want to check out Flash Video Expose for yourself, it’s available in the App Store for $10.00. And if you do decide to download it, make sure to let us know how it works in the comments.
* What do you think readers? Godsend, scam, or does Flash not matter to you anymore?
* Update: This truly is a scam. They updated their App Store description, which now says the following:
