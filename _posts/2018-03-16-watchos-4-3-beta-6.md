* Apple on Friday seeded the sixth beta of watchOS 4.3 to developers. Those in the developer program with the proper configuration profile can install the update over-the-air by navigating to the Software Update tab in the Apple Watch iPhone app.
* WatchOS 4.3 isn’t a milestone update, but it does include a handful of new features and improvements. Nightstand mode is now available in portrait (was just landscape-only), there’s a new charging animation, Music app control of iPhone music, and more.
