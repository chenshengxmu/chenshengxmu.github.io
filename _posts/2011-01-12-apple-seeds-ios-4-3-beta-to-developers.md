* A day after tales of the new iOS 4.3 came out touting the merits of the new Personal Hotspot feature, mostly due to the release of the Verizon iPhone, Apple started seeding iOS 4.3 beta to developers.
* This pre-release version of iOS 4.3 is for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, as well as for the Apple TV. Hopefully this new iOS will have a few surprises for us. More to come soonâ€¦
* [9 to 5 Mac]
