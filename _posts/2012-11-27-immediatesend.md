* ImmediateSend is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to send immediate replies to an ongoing text or iMessage conversation. The tweak assumes that you already know the context of the ongoing conversation, so it avoids opening the full body of the chat window to save time.
* Instead of the full chat body window, you are instead prompted to send responses to messages via a quick entry text window. This window contains options to reply as an SMS, iMessage, or to open the body of the chat for a full overview of the conversation at hand. Take a look inside for a video walkthrough of ImmediateSend…
* ImmediateSend works from the Home screen, the Lock screen, and even via the Phone and Contact apps. The tweak features one sole option in the Settings app to disable itself using a kill switch. Once disabled, text messaging returns to the way it worked prior to installing ImmediateSend, and no respring is required.
* If you want to try ImmediateSend, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it can be downloaded for $0.99. Please don’t forget to share your thoughts about the tweak in the comments below.
