* Corroborating iDB’s scoop that all Apple’s apps which ship with iOS software are about to get a major overhaul in iOS 6, the latest chatter in the rumor mill now has it that Apple at WWDC is launching redesigned front-ends for the App Store, iTunes Store and iBookstore.
* As for the new look, you can probably expect the App Store, iTunes Store and iBookstore apps to adopt that sexier silver appearance.
* But wait, there’s more to this redesign than meets the eye…
* Blogger Mark Gurman details his findings over at 9to5Mac, based on “sources familiar with Apple’s upcoming iOS 6 mobile software offering”:
* The overhauls are said to be major and they focus on improved interactivity when making purchases in iTunes, the App Store, and the iBookstore.
* Furthermore, “Apple is still planning to roll out complementary store redesigns for computers later this year”, Gurman reports.
* And as Apple becomes more social, social is said to be “a big piece of the store overhauls”, the author writes.
* Specifically, Facebook integration is said to be tested in the iTunes Store.
* Just a bit earlier today, MG Siegler reported for TechCrunch that Apple is finally readying system-wide Facebook integration, a headline new feature in iOS 6 designed to help people share content with Facebook friends without ever leaving their apps.
* Unfortunately, Gurman writes, better discoverability is not in the cards yet, at least not in time for an announcement at the  WWDC keynote June 11.
* Apple in February acquired Chomp for an undisclosed sum, a startup focused on app discovery that became popular shortly following its launch in 2009.
* The iPhone maker sometimes snaps up smaller companies for their engineering talent and technologies.
* Apple is widely expected to tap Chomp’s app search and discovery platform to improve content discoverability at a later stage.
* Disappointed?
