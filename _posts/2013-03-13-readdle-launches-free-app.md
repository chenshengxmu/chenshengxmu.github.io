* If you’ve ever perused through the Productivity section of the App Store, chances are you’ve come across one of Readdle’s apps. Titles like Documents, Scanner Pro and Printer Pro are staples in the category.
* The firm also has a popular calendar app, called ‘Calendars,’ which it has rebranded today to ‘Calendars+.’ It did this to make room for a new free version of the app, which includes many of its major features…
* Readdle describes Calendars as ” the most elegant and easy to use calendar application available on the App Store.” And it works with both Google and iOS accounts, allowing you to manage them from one place.
* Here are some of the features that it says sets Calendars apart from others:
* -Application Interface  It is clean, agile and focused on your productivity. 
* -Drag & Drop for events  You can move and change the duration of your events in a Day, Week or Month view with Drag & Drop. Just tap and hold on the event to activate it. 
* -Special Keyboards  Appointment time and reminders can be defined twice faster than in the built-in iOS calendar, all thanks to custom keyboards. 
* -The fastest Sync  Sync with Google Calendar works really fast and keeps your schedule thoroughly. 
* The paid version, Calendars+, includes all of the above features plus support for multiple event reminders, recurring appointments, event invitations and more—making it a great choice for so-called power users.
* Of course, Calendars can hold its own with power users too. It allows you to create events whether you’re on or offline, set SMS reminders for your entries, and perform a unified search through all of your accounts.
* I don’t really have the need for a third-party calendar app—I rarely use the built-in one as it is. But if I did, I would definitely give this one a trial-run. It has a no-nonsense UI, and a ton of features for the price.
* If you want to check it out, you can find Calendars in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free. Calendars+ is in there too, but it will cost you $6.99.
