* Apple on Thursday released an update to its desktop Safari browser for Macs running OS X Mavericks which contains improvements to compatibility and security while introducing a pair of new options for strengthening your privacy when searching.
* The first such feature turns on SSL encryption for all Yahoo searches conducted from Safari’s search field. As a result, no one can eavesdrop on what you’re searching for online.
* The other adds DuckGoGo, a search engine that does not track you (Google won’t like this) as a built-in option in the search field. Note that Safari in iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite already includes DuckGoGo as an option.
* Safari 7.1 has arrived on the heels of yesterday’s OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 update which contains Safari 7.0.6 and improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.
* Here’s Safari 7.1 changelog:
* More about the security content of Safari 7.1 in Apple’s support document here.
* For those wondering, DuckGoGO functions much like Chrome’s incognito mode: the search engine doesn’t track you, allowing you to browse the web knowing that your privacy is intact.
* Adding DuckDuckGo to Safari in iOS 8, Yosemite and now Mavericks makes it the first “privacy-focused search engine to be added to one of the top four browsers,” said the firm in a recent blog post.
* Yesterday, Apple also released the OS X Update 10.9.5. Arriving approximately two months after the 10.9.4 update and ahead of Yosemite’s launch next month, 10.9.5 improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.

* More about the 10.9.5 update:
* It’s recommended for all Mavericks users.
* Note that you need to apply the 10.9.5 update first because it’s required for Safari 7.1.
* Simply choose Software Update… under the Mac menu and hit the Updates tab to grab whatever updates are available for your operating system and apps.
* Will you be giving DuckDuckGo a try in Safari for Mavericks?
