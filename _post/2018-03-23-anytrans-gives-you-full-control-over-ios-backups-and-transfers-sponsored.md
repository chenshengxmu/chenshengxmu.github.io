* Making backups for your iOS devices regularly prevents unbearable data loss, but that’s not always an easy job to do. Wouldn’t it be great if you can back up your iOS devices wirelessly and automatically? How about being able to move around your music, photos, contacts, messages or any other data you want?
* Enter AnyTrans, a comprehensive solution for transferring, backing up and managing your iOS and Android content in one handy place. The app was created by iMobie, the makers of the iOS data recovery app PhoneRescue.
* AnyTrans converges all your Apple products and lets you fully manage your iPhone, iPad, iPod and even iTunes and iCloud content, all in one handy place. With AnyTrans, you can preview all the data and files contained within a backup file, select anything you’d like to extract, back up your devices and more.

* As an almighty data manager, the app is superior to Apple’s iTunes and iCloud backup systems in that it can wirelessly back up the most types of iOS data, including your photos, videos, messages and other personal information—no USB connection required. And because everything is backed up on a local or external disk, there are no annoying storage limits.

* Once you set up this feature, AnyTrans automatically back up your device daily, weekly, monthly or according to your custom schedule a long as your iPhone and computer are connected to the same SSL-secured local Wi-Fi network and “see” each other. AnyTrans takes advantage of a smart incremental backup algorithm that backs up file changes only so that each new backup takes up less space than the last.

* The company says your backups are 100% secure and private: using AES-256 encryption, your backups are safe enough that no one can access without your permission. Watch the embedded video to see the key features of AnyTrans Air Backup.
* Using the app’s built-in file manager, you can arrange your photos by the various categories, such as screenshots, Live photos, selfies, location and so forth—just like the stock Photos app.
* The app makes it easy to comb through the backup file by other data categories, like your iPhone contacts, messages, etc. As such, AnyTrans can be used to import or export just about any data type to your computer or iOS device. For instance, you can use AnyTrans to easily back up text messages on your iPhone.
* Other features of AnyTrans include a flexible tool for migrating data from your old iPhone to a new one, another one for moving your data from an Android device to your iPhone, the ability to automatically transcode your HEIC photos to the more widely used JPG format, convert Live Photos to GIF, MP4 or M4V format, plus much, much more.
* I suggest you give AnyTrans a whirl, it’s free to download.
* You can download the newest version of AnyTrans for Mac or Windows directly from the developer’s website for free, or get $10 off a full license with this limited-time offer. This is an exclusive offer for iDB readers only, and it is valid until March 25, 2018.
