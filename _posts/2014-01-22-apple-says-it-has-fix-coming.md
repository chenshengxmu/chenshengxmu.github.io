* If you’ve ever listened to an episode of iDB’s Let’s Talk iOS podcast, you know that many of us struggle with how buggy iOS 7 is. We’ve noted on multiple occasions that some of us see our iPhones and iPads crash more than once per day, which is pathetic.
* But there may be light at the end of this dark tunnel. Mashable has received an official comment from an Apple spokesperson that Apple is aware of a problem, which the site refers to as the “white/black screen of death,” and it has a fix coming a future update…
* Here’s the text from the report:
* “Since Apple released iOS 7, its completely revamped operating system for the iPhone, reviews have been mixed but mostly positive. However, a glitch that has quietly plagued iPhone users — the “white/black screen of death,” a bug that abruptly soft reboots the smartphone — will finally be addressed in a future iOS 7 update.
* “We have a fix in an upcoming software update for a bug that can occasionally cause a home screen crash,” Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told Mashable.”
* While I’m sure users experience this type of crashing in different ways, I’ve noticed that every once in a while—usually while I’m switching between apps or scrolling through large pages in Safari—my iPhone will either auto-respring or completely restart itself.
* The fix is expected to be included in the upcoming iOS 7.1 update, which is currently in its fourth beta. But of course, it’s also very possible that Apple could patch the issue by way of a minor update (like iOS 7.0.5.) if it wanted to correct the problem quickly.
* How about you, does your iOS 7 device crash or respring itself?
