* If you are still looking for an iPhone X, Apple now has them available to order, and be delivered in a week. If you place an order today, you should receive your new phone by December 8th.
* This is a remarkable turnaround for what many expected to be a very difficult phone to get ahold of. That isn’t to say demand has been slow, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities just recently issued a report outlining that vastly improved production times are behind the speedier delivery times.
* We just heard this week that Apple was able to move over 6 million iPhone Xs over Black Friday weekend.
* I can verify personally the quick delivery speeds as I was able to order a phone and have it delivered within three days.
* The improved iPhone X stock is not exclusive to Apple. Many carriers and third-party retailers are also seeing increased supply.
* If you haven’t gotten yours yet, it seems production has finally caught up to demand to make finding one easy. Let us know how your efforts go down in the comments.
