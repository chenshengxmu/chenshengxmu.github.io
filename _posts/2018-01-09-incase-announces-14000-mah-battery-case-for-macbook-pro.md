* Incase took the wraps off their latest MacBook accessory today at CES, the IconConnected Power Sleeve. It is a brilliantly obvious idea to build a large 14,000 mAh battery right into the case to charge your 15″ MacBook Pro on the go.
* The IconConnected Power Sleeve is really just a souped up version of their existing Icon model, with obviously a few adjustments. The hidden pocket stores a USB-C cable and the ports on the bottom let you connect a USB-C or USB-A cable to recharge your gear. Whether that is the MacBook Pro itself, or any other USB device.
* The reminds me of the DockCase we reviewed that built a USB-C dock right into the sleeve of your laptop.
* While the DockCase worked well because you didn’t need to use it while the laptop was in the sleeve, a battery pack is the other way around. I find it would be substantially more useful if there was a way for me to charge up my MacBook, while it was in the case. I would love a solution that allowed my computer to charge up whenever I put it away in my bag.
* Whether I am going meeting to meeting at a trade show, or a college student going class to class, it would be amazing to seamlessly have your Mac charged every time you take it out of your bag.

* Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the IconConnected Power Sleeve will be that magical product.
* If you are still interested, it looks to drop in Q3 of 2018 for $199.95, which seems a bit steep for a USB-C battery pack that can charge your laptop.
