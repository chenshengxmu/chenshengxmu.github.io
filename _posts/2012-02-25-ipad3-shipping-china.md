* With the iPad 3 rumored to be announced in the first week of March, 9to5mac’s Mark Gurman has provided a few more tidbits about the iPad 3’s launch this evening. 9to5mac has obtained a leaked shipping document indicating that the iPad 3 has already begun shipping from China and is making its way to US airports. The document says that deliveries are set to take place March 9th.
* Next, there’s word that Apple could be taking pre-orders for the iPad 3. You may recall that the iPad 2 wasn’t available for pre-order, while the original iPad was…

* 9to5mac says that iPad 3 pre-orders could begin as early as March 7th, or possibly a few days later. A couple weeks ago, we reported that the iPad 3 will be announced March 7th.
* The iPad 3 is rumored to have a Retina display, quad-core processor, upgraded cameras, LTE, and Siri support. Apple’s new tablet is also rumored to ship with iOS 5.1.
* Additionally, 9to5mac reports that Apple may launch a second product in March — which is most likely to be the upgraded Apple TV we’ve been hearing about over the past few months. Most likely shipping at $99, it’s rumored to have 1080p and Bluetooth 4 support.
* Lastly, the report indicates that Apple may keep around the iPad 2 at a lower price point. Apple will discontinue all of the iPad 2’s, except the black and white 16GB units, to sell them for cheaper than the iPad 3.
* With these rumors dropping in, an early March launch seems like a definite reality. It’s just a matter of what date exactly, we’re waiting on. Apple should be sending out invites to their press event in the coming days.
* Are you excited for the iPad 3?
