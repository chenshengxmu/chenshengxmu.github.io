* In October, Apple CEO Tim Cook participated in an interesting on-stage interview at The Wall Street Journal’s inaugural WSJ.D Live conference. During the 30-minute discussion, Cook talked about several topics including Apple Pay, Apple Watch and more.
* Of course, Cook has done a handful of high profile interviews in recent months, but he does divulge some new details regarding Apple and its products during this talk. We covered some of the highlights here, but now you can watch the whole thing on video.
* Again, it’s been a big couple of months for Cook, with Apple unveiling larger iPhones, a mobile payment service, the Apple Watch and other new products—not to mention it’s coming off a record-breaking Q4. If you have the time, this video is definitely worth watching.
