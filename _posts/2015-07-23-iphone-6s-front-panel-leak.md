* According to the rumor-mill, Apple’s suppliers have recently begun volume production of key components for the upcoming iPhones, such as an Apple-designed ‘A9’ processor and chassis. These parts will be soon, or already are, all over the place in Asia so little wonder we’re now starting to see first component leaks.
* The leakage kicked off with a claimed rear housing which has seemingly confirmed minuscule changes to the interior and a stronger body. The leaks now continue with a photo of a rumored front panel of the ‘iPhone 6s,’ published Thursday by French blog NowhereElse.fr.
* What you see here is allegedly the front panel of the next-generation iPhone refresh. As you can see for yourself, it looks virtually the same as the present-generation iPhone 6’s front panel.
* This is hardly surprising.
* Apple typically keeps the iPhone’s design intact over two generations before making noticeable changes to the phone’s look and feel. Last year’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus refreshes have brought us a rounder, much sleeker design.
* Given it’s now an iPhone “S” year, we don’t really anticipate significant changes to the current design until an ‘iPhone 7’ comes along some time in 2016.

* According to the site’s source, these panels are currently in production at a supplier factory. The source even provided photos depicting a worker whose face is blurred to protect his identity. The worker appears to be packing parts for shipment.

* The front plates should be delivered to Foxconn and Pegatron, the companies Apple typically commissions to assemble iPhones.
* The French publication claims to have received images of the front panel from a trusted source, who has confirmed that white panels are for white and gold iPhone 6s devices (shocker). However, he couldn’t tell if the new iPhones will have pressure-sensitive screen, as previously rumored.
* Sadly, it’s impossible to make an educated guess based on these shots as to whether or not the leaked part has Force Touch sensors, let alone if the screen has a sapphire coating or the traditional Gorilla Glass.
* NowhereElse.fr has emerged as a reliable source of production parts for upcoming Apple gadgets and this particular leak looks as real as these things get.
