* iTunes, Apple’s more than a decade old jukebox and digital content management software, could be updated today alongside the iPhone, iPod and possibly iMac and the AirPort wireless base station lineup.
* This comes by way of search engine queries that also revealed the iPhone 5 name earlier today alongside LTE, new iPod touches and revamped nanos.
* This information aligns nicely with a Bloomberg report earlier in the summer which claimed iTunes would receive a substantial makeover by year’s end…
* 9to5Mac editor Seth Weintraub has some interesting intelligence on iTunes 11:
* From high-level AppleCare employees, currently training for iTunes 11, we’ve heard the new digital player has been re-designed from the ground up and is much sleeker and faster.
* The upcoming update may also explain the wonkiness of the App Store over the past week or so.
* It is a high time that Apple reboots the sluggish resource hog that is iTunes, wouldn’t you agree?
