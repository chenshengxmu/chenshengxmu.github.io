* iTunes 9.2 features and improvements include:
* Jailbreakers and people who plan to jailbreak their iPhones or iPads should stay away from iTunes 9.2 for the time being.
* According to the Dev Team, Don’t install today’s iTunes 9.2 if you plan on using Spirit for fresh JB (but it’s fine for PwnageTool & redsn0w users).
* If your iPad has already been jailbroken with Spirit, then everything will work fine. If however you plan on jailbreaking your iPad with Spirit, it will be caught in a boot loop.
