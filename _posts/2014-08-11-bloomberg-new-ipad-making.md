* Bloomberg is out with a new report this afternoon regarding Apple’s new iPads. The outlet claims that the company’s suppliers have already begun producing the new tablets, which are expected to debut towards the end of this quarter or early next.
* According to their sources, mass production of the full 9.7-inch iPad is already under way, and production for the new iPad mini is right behind it. Additionally, the tablets will evidently feature new anti-reflective coating, making them easier to read…
* Here’s more from Bloomberg’s Tim Culpan and Peter Burrows:
* Mass production of a full-sized iPad with a 9.7-inch screen is already under way, with an unveiling projected for the end of this quarter or early next, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. A new version of the 7.9-inch iPad mini is also entering production and will probably be available by the end of the year, they said. […]
* Output of the larger iPad may be restricted by manufacturing complications related to the use of a new anti-reflection coating, which Apple plans to add to the device to make the display easier to read, said one of the people.
* We’ve seen a few alleged part leaks for this year’s larger iPad, but almost nothing for the new mini. The leaks show a very familiar design, albeit a few minor changes changes, such as a new speaker grill on the bottom and more-recessed volume buttons.
* Both tablet lines are expected to get Touch ID, internal improvements, and new features by way of iOS 8. Apple reportedly has an iPhone event planned for September, and an iWatch unveiling in October, so it’s unclear right now where the new iPads will fit in.
