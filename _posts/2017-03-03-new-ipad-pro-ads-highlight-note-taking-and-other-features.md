* Apple just rolled out a pair of new iPad Pro commercials via its YouTube channel, running sixteen seconds each and titled “Need Less Stuff” and “Take Better Notes”. The former positions iPad Pro as a clutter-free alternative to clunky desktop PCs.
* The latter makes the bold claim that iPad Pro and Apple Pencil “revolutionized the way people take notes,” adding that users can even record voice notes. Watch the new videos, then jump into the comment section to tell us how you liked them.
* Like prior iPad Pro videos, the new clips are based on real tweets from real people.
* Here are the new videos.
* Based on a 2012 tweet from Twitter account @jeszka24.
* “You could take notes in a whole new way, if your computer was an iPad Pro”.
* We get it, Apple—iPad is the new computer.
* Based on a 2015 tweet from blogger, designer and photographer Lix Hewett.
* “Your computer would be more than a computer, if your computer was an iPad Pro,” says the video’s description. Must be fun for these folks to wake up realizing their tweeting has been featured in an Apple commercial.
* The previous ad has showcased other Apple Pencil features.
* The remaining clips in Apple’s “Real problems… answered” ad campaign positioned iPad Pro as a viable notebook replacement, focusing on such features and benefits as lack of viruses, availability of Microsoft Office and built-in cellular connectivity.
* How do you like the new videos?
* Which one do you prefer over the other, and why?
