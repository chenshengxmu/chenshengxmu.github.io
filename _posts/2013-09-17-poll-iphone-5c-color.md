* Haters are unapologetically disparaging Apple’s iPhone 5c as an old iPhone 5 dressed up in some fancy colors. There’s nothing wrong with that, mind you. At the same time, the device appears to be quickly selling out pretty much everywhere, from the United States to China. Prudent watchers are wise to warn against underestimating the power of the color in marketing, even more so with the world’s greatest marketing machine pitching the colorized iPhone 5c.
* We’ve already asked you whether you’ll be getting an iPhone 5s or 5c and now we zero in on the colorful iPhone 5c. So, which iPhone 5c color are you?
* I wasn’t kidding when I wrote above that Apple is positioning the iPhone 5c as a fashion statement.
* Here’s an excerpt from the iPhone 5c web page:
* Color is more than just a hue. It expresses a feeling. Makes a statement. Declares an allegiance. Color reveals your personality. iPhone 5c, in five anything-but-shy colors, does just that. It’s not just for lovers of color. It’s for the colorful.
* Assuming you were buying an iPhone 5c, which color would you pick?

* What iPhone 5c color would you pick?We’re down in comments so feel free to discuss your choice of iPhone 5c color with fellow readers.
* By the way, if you haven’t already seen Apple’s inaugural iPhone 5c ad unapologetically titled ‘Plastic Perfected,’ I urge you to check it out ASAP.
* For a moment, I thought they were advertising a new iPod music player there.
