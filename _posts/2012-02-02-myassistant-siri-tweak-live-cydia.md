title: 'MyAssistant' Siri Tweak Now Live on Cydia
---
* It’s been a good day for Cydia releases. Not long after RingerX VIP was released comes MyAssistant (formerly called MySiri). MyAssistant brings a gang of new customization options to Siri; everything from custom conversations to toggles, Activator events, and more.
* MyAssistant is now available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99, which is fairly cheap considering all of the options. Be sure to read our full walkthrough of the tweak and give it a go.
