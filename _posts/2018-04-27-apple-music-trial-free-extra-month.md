* Apple is giving away an extra free month of service to the original Apple Music trial customers who didn’t become paying subscribers following the expiration of their 3-month free trial.
* Reddit user ashindn1l3 reported receiving a notification following the expiration of his free three-month trial that took him to the webpage page with Apple’s offer. This has permitted non-subscribers to get an additional month of free music before actually subscribing.
* “Come see what you’ve been missing in the new Apple Music, like a simpler design that makes finding what you want and discovering new music, easier than ever,” reads Apple’s message.
* TUTORIAL: How to prevent your Apple Music subscription from auto renewing
* Customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong and other markets have reported being notified by Apple about the offer via push notifications and emails.
* It is entirely possible, as some commenters pointed out, that this offer is limited to those who signed up for a free trial following Apple Music’s redesign in iOS 10. Apple appears to have been running this promotion for at least six months now.
* Other streaming companies are also offering similar freebies.
* Google Music offers a three-month trial. Amazon Music comes with a four-month trial. Spotify and Apple Music both offer three months of free music before they charge your credit card although we saw 6-month Apple Music and Spotify trials with certain carriers and partners.
* Pricing and promotions for Apple Music vary from country to country. In some markets, for instance, these Apple Music trials require a small payment. According to Apple, they currently have about eight million trial accounts.
* Faced with competition from Apple Music which passed 40 million subscribers, Spotify has boosted its free tier with such perks as on-demand playlists, a data saver mode and more.
