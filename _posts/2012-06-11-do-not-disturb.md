* We touched on this feature a bit earlier, and now we’re getting the chance to check it out for ourselves. Here it is, the new Do Not Disturb option in iOS 6.
* As the name implies, the Do Not Disturb feature will silence all incoming phone calls and other alerts from pretty much anyone, or app, you tell it to…

* The feature comes with a slew of customizable options, including scheduling, white list (contacts whose calls you don’t want silenced), and a toggle to allow repeated (possible emergency) calls to come through.

* It’s nice because with Do Not Disturb enabled, your device won’t make any noise, vibrate or light up — which can really come in handy for blocking annoying late-night texts and push notifications.

* We were hoping that Apple would finally implement customizable Profiles in iOS 6 . But hey, this is cool too.
* What do you think of the new Do Not Disturb feature?
