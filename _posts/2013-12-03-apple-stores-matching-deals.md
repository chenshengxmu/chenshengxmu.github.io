* Looking for a deal on an iPhone 5c or iPad Air for the holidays? Well it looks like your local Apple Store may be able to help out. According to a new report, a number of locations have started to price-match on these new products.
* This means that if you see a sale going on at your nearby carrier store or electronics reseller, you might be able to get Apple to match their prices. It sounds like discounting will stop at 10% and of course other restrictions apply…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has the scoop:
* “Weeks after launch, a number of Apple Stores in the United States have begun price-matching both the iPad Air and iPhone 5c. Sources say that the ability to price-match those new devices began earlier this week.
* The price-matching will vary region-to-region, with some markets choosing to not conduct any price-matching at this time.”
* Gurman says that stores that do support matching will only match up to 10% off. So if your carrier is running a sale where you can get the iPhone 5c for $0 or $0.99 with contract, you shouldn’t expect Apple to offer you the same deal.
* Apple has in the past offered price-matching for its iPhone 4, iPhone 4s and briefly for its iPad Air. And yesterday, the company announced that it would be offering free shipping on all orders (regardless of price) through the holidays.
