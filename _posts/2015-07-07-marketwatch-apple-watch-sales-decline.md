title: Report states that Apple Watch sales face a major decline, but take it with a grain of salt

* Palo Alto, Calif.-based Slice Intelligence, is reporting that Apple Watch sales (US only) are facing a significant slowdown, as noted by MarketWatch this afternoon. Per Slice, the Apple Watch has gone from a peak of around 200,000 units a day right around launch, to under 20,000 units a day.
* Obviously, this sort of data isn’t based on cold hard facts—only Apple itself would be able to provide us with 100% accurate numbers—but this kind of report does put a gloomy cloud over the Apple Watch.
* Should Apple be worried? It’s simply way too early to tell right now.
* But one must remember that, unlike its iPhone and iPads, the Apple Watch is a brand new product category, and Apple has been met with significant supply chain constraints. Remember, it wasn’t that long ago when you couldn’t even walk into a store and buy one.

* According to MarketWatch, Slice Intelligence is basing its numbers on electronic receipts, which to be honest, sounds a bit ambiguous, and well, let’s just be frank—inaccurate. Slice is an opt-in only service, and only pertains to those who agree to have their inboxes scanned for receipts. However, even if the numbers are off, the Apple Watch probably isn’t yet the surefire hit that C-level execs at Apple were hoping for.
* Slice’s report indicates that two-thirds of the units sold are from cheaper SKU’s like the Apple Watch Sport (starting at $349), with the higher price models selling much less, and the Edition models selling only 2,000 units this far (not surprising given their cost).
* It is notable, however, that Apple has yet to drop any comments on sales figures for the Apple Watch, something it normally likes to tout after a strong showing of its products soon after launch. This doesn’t totally come as a surprise, however, as Apple has previously started that it’s rolling watch sales into the “other” category—meaning, don’t expect them to divulge sales figures.
* Keep in mind, that Slice’s figures are also US-only, meaning that a large chunk of sales are automatically cut out of any such report.
* I personally don’t see many Apple Watches out in the wild, but as someone in the midwest, it’s not thats surprising given my location and the issues with the supply chain.
* I would say that’s it’s way too early to call the Apple Watch a dud, as I’m sure its competitors and Apple haters will be licking their chops to do. Remember, the original iPhone wasn’t exactly a barnburner when it debuted, yet look at it now.
* What do you think? Do you put much stock into data like this?
