* Apple CEO Tim Cook is making the media rounds this week, following his company’s big product unveiling event on Tuesday. He’s spoken with ABC, The Wall Street Journal and several other outlets, and today he has popped up in an interview on PBS’ The Charlie Rose Show.
* It’s a two-part interview, with the first segment airing today, and PBS has just posted a handful of clips from the conversation to YouTube. In them, Cook talks to Charlie about a wide range of topics, including Steve Jobs, Apple’s Beats acquisition, and its future plans for TV.
* Again, the full first segment of the interview will air later tonight on PBS, with the second part airing on Monday night.
