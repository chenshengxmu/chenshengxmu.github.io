* Apple Music has surpassed 40 million paid subscribers, according to Apple content director Steven Huon. That’s up at least 2 million from the latest number shared on March 12 by SVP Eddy Cue, during a SXSW conference.
* UPDATE: It cannot be established that Steven Huon even worked for Apple or at least his Twitter handle @StevenHuon cannot be traced back to former or current Apple employees. That said, extrapolating the growth of Apple Music does suggest that the music-streaming service is probably approaching 40 million paid subscribers by now.
* Huon, who is based in Paris and helps Apple find premium content, typically tweets tidbits regarding the company in a more cryptic manner. But the image he posted this morning, which we’ve posted above, is anything but mysterious.
* Apple Music launched in June of 2015. Built from the remains of the acquired Beats Music, the streaming service pitched itself as a highly tailored app with exclusives and other premium content from top artists like Drake and Chance.
* Today’s news comes just a day after Spotify went public, where it was valued at roughly $30 billion. Spotify enjoys a paid subscriber base of 71 million, and is seen as the leader in the music streaming space, with Apple in a close second.
