title: Another claimed iPhone 6 resolution emerges- 1,472-by-828 pixels at 16-9 ratio

* Back in May, code strings discovered in a beta of the iOS 8 software development kit (SDK) suggested that one of the upcoming iPhone 6 models has a screen resolution of 1,704-by-960 pixels, indicating a pixel density of 416 pixels per inch (ppi).
* This, in turn, would be more than comfortably above Apple’s self-imposed Retina requirement of 300ppi.
* A reference to a larger 1,472-by-828 resolution has now been spotted in a file added in Xcode 6 beta 5.
* This assumed resolution on a 4.7-inch device would yield Retina-class 360ppi, or 307ppi on a larger 5.5-inch panel…
* The discovery was made by Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac.
* As a little backgrounder, iOS since the iPhone 5/5s/5c has derived all device resolutions as multiples of the base 568-by-320 resolution, so-called “point values”.
* Scale 568-by-320 horizontally and vertically by a factor of two and you get the current four-inch Retina screen topping out at 1,136-by-640 pixels.
* Likewise, tripling the 568-by-320 resolution brings us up to the aforementioned 1,704-by-960 pixels — you get the picture. And as Gurman explained in his write-up, the iOS 8 SDK has added a resolution of 736-by-414 as a new starting point.
* Multiply this base resolution by a factor of two and you get a new 1,472-by-828 pixel resolution canvas for your apps, media and other content.
* Gurman explains:
* Back to the new 414 x 736 file, this iPhone resolution would be slightly sharper (on the 4.7-inch model) than the current iPhone resolution and this new pixel density would actually bring more screen space to the iPhone, allowing Apple to unlock more software-based functionality for its flagship smartphone lineup.
* Unlike with previous iPhone resolution changes, moving to 414 on the width and 736 on the length would add pixels to both the height and the width of the iPhone.
* Moving from 3.5 to four inches, the iPhone 5’s screen was taller, but not wider.
* Adding more color to the report, earlier today Russian luxury modified iPhone vendor Feld & Volk on its Instagram page shared a photo of a rumored 4.7-inch iPhone 6 panel, pictured under a microscope and shown below.

* MacRumors took it upon themselves to analyze the image and what they’ve discovered is interesting, to say the least.
* Although  Feld & Volk itself told MacRumors that the panel does indeed carry a resolution of 1,704-by-960, the publication believes that the actual resolution is closer to the 1,472-by-828 resolution Gurman talked about.
* The photograph posted by Feld & Volk does not, however, necessarily appear to agree with that claim, as it seems to show roughly 13 pixels per mm in the horizontal and vertical directions, while a 4.7-inch display at 1704 x 960 should be closer to 16 pixels per mm. The current iPhone 5s display is roughly 10.5 pixels per mm.
* The two resolutions indicate Apple might launch a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 at 1,472-by-828 and a 5.5-incher at 1,704-by-960. If so, then both handsets would have pixel densities of 355-360 pixels per inch, as MacRumors points out, with the bigger iPhone packing in more pixels.

* There’s also a third possibility: Apple could use a single resolution across both iPhones, either 1,704-by-960 or the 1,472-by-828 one. The company did just that with the iPad mini’s release.
* Despite packing in a smaller 7.9-inch panel, the Retina iPad mini still rocks the same 2,048-by-1,536 pixel resolution of its bigger 9.7-inch counterpart.

* In turn, the iPad mini has gained instant per-pixel compatibility with literally every app that has been previously released for 9.7-inch Retina iPads.
* As Apple adds more devices and form factors to its family, introducing new screen resolutions is inevitable.
* Luckily, Apple now provides, and has been pushing developers to use, the tools which allow for the creation of iOS user interfaces which dynamically and intelligently auto-adapt to whatever target resolution is available.
* What do you think of all this?
