* When I’m in a hurry, I prefer to send my friends short audio recordings by tapping on Messages’ microphone icon than peck away on my iPhone’s keyboard.
* Apple calls this Tap to Talk and it’s even better with Messages’ walkie-talkie-like Raise to Listen function which lets me listen to, or respond to an audio message by lifting the phone to my ear (bonus: both features work the Lock screen).
* On the downside, audio messages pile up on and can waste precious storage space over time. In this post, we’re going to tell you about a handy switch in Settings to prevent Messages from automatically keeping every audio message you receive.
* Step 1: Go to Settings → Messages on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* Step 2: Tap Expire under the Audio Messages heading.
* Step 3: Select After 2 minutes to have iOS automatically remove any audio message created within Messages two minutes after it has been listened to.

* “When you send or listen to an audio message, it will automatically be removed from your conversation history after 2 minutes,” reads the feature’s description.
* IMPORTANT: This setting does not affect audio attachments that are created outside of Messages and then shared through Messages via iOS’s multi-purpose Share sheets. Those are kept in the Messages database forever, or at least until you delete them manually.
* To automatically keep audio messages, select the Never option. People who exchange a lot of audio messages through Messages might want to use this option as it helps save storage space.

* Even if you set audio messages to expire after two minutes, you can easily override this setting on a per-message basis by tapping the Keep link below an audio attachment.
