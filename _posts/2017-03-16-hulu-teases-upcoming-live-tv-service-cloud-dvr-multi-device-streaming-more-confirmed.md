* Hulu recently updated its experiencehulu.com mini-site, which highlights the company’s existing video on demand service and a forthcoming live television offering. The website refresh has revealed previously unconfirmed features such as cloud DVR, multi-device streaming, user profiles, support for guest accounts, real-time notifications for live events and other perks. The sub-$40 service is expected to launch across iOS, tvOS and other platforms in the coming months.
* According to the website and the accompanying video which you can watch further below, Hulu’s live TV service will have access to multiple streams in the house, support watching live programming away from home and include a cloud DVR feature for saving anything to watch later.
