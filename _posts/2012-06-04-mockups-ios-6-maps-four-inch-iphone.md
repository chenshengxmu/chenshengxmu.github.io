title: Mockup depicts enhanced Maps on four-inch iPhone 5
---
* As you know, iOS 6 will bring an all-new Maps app said to feature Apple’s own tiles and brand new in-house solution for breathtaking 3D view.
* Though Google is expected to add the third dimension to its own Maps service as early as Wednesday, we’ve already seen screenshot mockups depicting 3D terrain in iOS 6 Maps.
* As for the enhanced two-dimensional view, here’s what the new Maps app could look like on that next iPhone that by all accounts seems to feature a taller four-inch display…
* A user “gimosachin” created and posted to The Verge these gorgeous mockups of Maps and Safari apps in iOS 6 running on a four-inch iPhone 5.
* Here’s the Maps mockup.

* And this is what Safari would look like on the next iPhone featuring a taller four-inch display.
* Wait, no edge-to-edge display?
* By the way, notice the new-look silver theme that will also make a debut in iOS 6.

* By all accounts, iOS 6 will enable Siri on the iPad 3 and Siri support in third-party apps, also bringing out system-wide Facebook integration while carrying over certain new features from OS X Mountain Lion. Major enhancements to stock apps are to be expected across the board as well.
* What do you guys think?
* That is one tall iPhone for sure.
* Given that many commenters don’t necessarily like the idea of a taller iPhone, these mockups really do the justice explaining how apps would benefit from the extra pixels.
