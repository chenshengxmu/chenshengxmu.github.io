* Here at iDB, we’re big fans of the iCade controller line. Both the iCade arcade cabinet and the 8-Bitty gamepad have a fun, retro look to them, and they support more iOS titles than any other controller.
* So as you can imagine, we were pretty excited when we found out that ThinkGeek was going to be discounting the two accessories, along with several other items, as part of its major Black Friday sale….

* MacRumors points to the sale, which includes everything from canned unicorn meat, to a talking bacon doll. Fortunately, it also includes the iCade controllers, and a couple of other iOS-related products.
* It’s worth noting that the iCade controllers work with the jailbreak app Blutrol, which enables you to use them with virtually any iOS game that has on-screen controls, which dramatically increases their values.
* But even if you aren’t interested in one of the above items for yourself, they may make nice gifts with the holidays coming up. Either way, you can find them all at the ThinkGeek store for assumably a limited time.
* Anyone buying an iCade today?
