* If you updated your iPhone to iOS 9 or later, you have gained the ability to save voicemails as notes or voice memos, or share them directly as audio files with Messages, Mail or Airdrop.
* This can prove quite useful, if you ask me. Before iOS 9, your voicemails were confined to the Phone app as there was no way to get them out of there.
* In addition, saving voicemails as voice memos lets you trim the audio in the Voice Memos app before sharing them with others.
* Step 1: Open the Phone app on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on the Voicemail tab at the bottom.
* Step 3: Choose the voicemail message you’d like to save and hit the Share icon.
* Step 4: Now select Notes or Voice Memos options in the top row of the Share menu. You can choose to add your voicemail to an existing note or save it as a new note.

* Saving your voicemail as a voice memo comes with the benefit of being able to trim the audio file in the stock Voice Memos app before you share it further. Keep in mind that deleting a saved voicemail from Voice Memos doesn’t remove it from the Phone app.

* Tip: When you sync an iPhone with iTunes, your voice memos get imported into your iTunes music library as audio files.
* Should you need to embed a voicemail into an iMessage or MMS message, attach it as an audio file to an email message or send it wirelessly to other iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac devices using AirDrop, you can do so by following the steps outline below.
* Step 1: Open the Phone app on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on the Voicemail tab at the bottom.
* Step 3: Select the voicemail message that you’d like to save and tap the Share icon.
* Step 4: Choose Messages, Mail or Airdrop from the Share menu.
* Step 5: Write an optional message and hit the Send button to share the message with the attached voicemail using Messages or Mail. To share your voicemail with other devices in your proximity, choose AirDrop and select an AirDrop contact to share with.
