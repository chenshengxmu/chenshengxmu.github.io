* Facebook’s Instagram posted an update today for its iOS client, bringing the app to version 6.11.0. The update brings about a handful of improvements, including new filters and the ability to use emoji in hashtags.
* The new filters include Lark, Reyes and Juno, and Instagram describes the creative tool additions “as a family of modern, subtle filters that brighten and enhance your photos in refined, beautiful ways.”
* Inspired by weekend adventures outdoors, Lark, Reyes and Juno are a family of modern, subtle filters that brighten and enhance your photos in refined, beautiful ways. Lark desaturates reds while punching up blues and greens to bring your landscapes to life. Reyes brings a dusty, vintage look to your moments. And finally, Juno tints cool tones green while making warm tones pop and whites glow for vibrant photos of people.
* As for emoji hashtags, Instagram says that they will work just like regular hashtags. So you can use them to tag your photos, you can use them to search photos in the Explore tab, and you can tap on them in captions.
* You may also notice flatter Like and Comment icons, and other design elements have changed as well. Instagram has made a number of changes to its app in recent months, adding new Fade and Color tools in early April.
* You can find the latest version of Instagram in the App Store for free.
