* Developer Square Enix this morning issued a new content update to its turn-based isometric puzzle mobile game, Lara Croft GO. Bumping version number to 2.1.7, the game now lets you take Lara through a whole new journey in an alternate reality. Specifically, the update brings out a whole new chapter named Mirror of Spirits with 25 new puzzles and three new mechanics. As a bonus, players get a brand new Lara-themed sticker pack for iMessage. The update is available at no additional charge to those who have purchased the game.
* In case you haven’t played the game yet, you control Lara in a manner that’s very different from other action adventures. Basically, each move works like taking turns on a board game. Of course, you must avoid various traps, fight monsters and find your way through ancient ruins by moving pillars, scaring off pythons and more.
* Check out the trailer below.
* These new levels arrived on PlayStation and PC a few months ago.
* In my review of Lara Croft GO, I wrote that the game represents “the essence of adventure that feels unmistakably Tomb Raider-y”. This very much holds true today, more than a year and a half following the game’s App Store debut.
* Lara Croft GO was Apple’s iPhone Game of the Year 2015 and we included it on our own Best Apps and Games of 2015 list.
* Lara Croft GO, a universal download supporting iOS and tvOS, is $1.99 on App Store.
* If you’re a fan of Square Enix’s GO series, you can grab the GO Trilogy comprised of three great games—Lara Croft GO, Deus Ex GO and Hitman GO—for just $4.99. All three titles are compatible with the fourth-generation Apple TV.
