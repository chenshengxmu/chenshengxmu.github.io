* Apple designed the Home screen’s icon labels to be legible against most wallpapers out of the box, but some exceptions exist, especially when using third-party alternatives to the stock offerings. In other situations, users simply want something more expressive than just plain-Jane black or white.
* Whatever the case may be, a new free jailbreak tweak called TintIconLabels by iOS developer CydiaGeek is here to help. Just as the name implies, TintIconLabels lets you adjust the appearance of your application icon labels.
* In the screenshots above, you can see a few examples of TintIconLabels in action. As you might have noticed, the tweak lets you modify both the label text color and the label background color. The former is ideal for aesthetic, while the latter can be suitable for improving legibility against busy wallpapers.
* TintIconLabels adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The color configuration cells feature a full-range color picker, which means you aren’t limited to a pre-defined list of colors. Instead, you have the absolute freedom to select virtually any color you can land a finger on.
* The developer includes a convenient respring button at the bottom of the preference pane so that you can save changes to the options after making them.
* Changing the color of the app icon labels isn’t a new concept by any means, but it’s a popular mod among themers who like to keep a consistent aesthetic going on their devices. That aside, anyone can use this tweak, themer or not, to make their device unique from everyone else’s.
* If you’re interested in trying TintIconLabels, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, 10, and 11 devices.
