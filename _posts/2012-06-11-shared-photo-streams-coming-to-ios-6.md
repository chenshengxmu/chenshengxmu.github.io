* Photo Stream has always been a nice feature, but it’s always felt a bit limited, because you can’t currently share your Streams with other iOS users. Now all of that is about to change with iOS 6.
* Shared Photo Streams will allow you to share you photos on the fly with selected iOS users. This could be a great feature to keep family and friends in touch with what’s going on in your life…
* Now you can share just the photos you want, with just the people you choose. Simply select photos from the Photos app, tap the Share button, choose who you want to share your photos with, and they’re on their way. Friends using iCloud on an iOS 6 device or a Mac running Mountain Lion get the photos delivered immediately in the Photos app or iPhoto.You can even view shared photo streams on Apple TV. If the folks you’re sharing with aren’t using an Apple device, they can view your photos on the web. People can like individual photos and make comments. And you can share as much as you want: Your shared photo streams don’t count against your iCloud storage, and they work over Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

* Once you choose the albums you want to share, along with the people you want to share it with, your friends and family can comment and like your photos almost like they do on Facebook. In fact it feels very Facebook-ish, which is odd considering Apple is directly implementing Facebook within iOS 6.
* What do you think about Shared Photo Streams?
