* Among the options you can change are:
* A respring button is included at the bottom of the preferences pane for saving your options after making changes to the Settings.
* It is worth noting that some of these options can also be found in Springtomize 4, such as hiding the Today page and customizing the Notification Center background. On the other hand, betterNC10 also comes with numerous options that Springtomize 4 doesn’t have, so it may be worth checking out either way.
* If you’re interested in trying it out for yourself, betterNC10 can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
