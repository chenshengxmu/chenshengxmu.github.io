* As rumors about Apple switching to the all-new metallic glass material for a next-generation iPhone continue to persist, one designer has weighed in with own rendition of what the device might look like, both from the inside and the outside – and it’s quite noteworthy.
* As you know, Apple obtained a worldwide exclusive license to use Liquidmetal alloy in consumer electronics products. With previous rumors alleging a complete redesign, a Liquidmetal-based iPhone is certainly a plausible proposition…
* French designer Antoine Brieux has gone all out creating these gorgeous sixth-generation Liquidmetal iPhone shots, available on his blog.
* The use of the new metallic glass alloy would let Apple create a stronger, lighter and thinner iPhone, with a body just 7.9mm thin (versus the 9.3mm profile of the current iPhone 4S).
* Gone is the physical home button (though a recent leak hinted otherwise) as Brieux envisions a virtual home button sitting at the screen bottom.
* The concept calls for a large 4.5-inch widescreen display that could, however, create issues with third-party apps.
* Here’s a shot depicting the Angry Birds on a widescreen Liquidmetal iPhone.

* And another one showing a tweaked bezel running around the sides of the device.

* Here’s another angle. Notice the virtual home button occupying the extra space gained by blowing up the iPhone’s 3:2 display to a larger 16:9 widescreen appearance.

* And yet another angle. Check out the 3.5mm audio jack in the middle.

* As for the innards, Brieux thinks the device will be powered by a quad-core A6 chip.

* Is this what a Liquidmetal iPhone could look like?
* I think it looks business and certainly shows some hallmarks of Apple’s trademark industrial design.
* The question is, would Apple really buck its own trend and blow up the iPhone’s display to a whopping 4.5 inches?
