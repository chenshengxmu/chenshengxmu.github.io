* At any given time, there are dozens (if not hundreds) of apps floating around the App Store with built-in ROM emulators. These apps are disguised as calculators and sketch pads, but feature the hidden ability to play old-school games.
* And everyone once in a while we find out the name of one of these apps, and how to activate its secret feature, before Apple has the chance to pull it. And that just so happens to be the case with this newly-posted app called Earthquake 7…
* Simply type in ‘Earthquake 7’ into the search bar of the App Store on your iOS device, and locate the app by developer Kalana Jayatilake. It should have a pink icon, and in the description it claims to offer up ‘the latest earthquake news.’

* Once you’ve downloaded the app, you’ll want to tap on the search bar, type in ‘gba activate 638,’ and initiate the search. Doing this will bring up a ‘Games’ menu, which should show all of the GBA ROMs you have installed on your device.
* Now, we won’t tell you how or where to get the ROMs, but if you need help installing them to your non-jailbroken iPhone or iPad, click here. Otherwise, click here to download Earthquake 7 ($2). And hurry, history tells us it won’t be there long.
* Update: as several readers have noted in the comments below, it appears that this emulator is only working with .gb ROMs and not .gba ROMs. Still, we’re surprised it hasn’t been pulled yet.
* Thanks Mutz!
