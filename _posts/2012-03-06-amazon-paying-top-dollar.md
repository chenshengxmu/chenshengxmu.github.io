* Unless something totally unexpected happens, Apple is going to unveil a new tablet tomorrow. And if the past is any indication, it will become available for purchase within the next week or so.
* That gives those of you still looking to sell off your old tablets to help pay for a new one, plenty of time to find the best deal. And word on the street is, you might want to check out Amazon…
* As noted by Wired, Amazon is offering “surprisingly high bounties” for used iPads right now.
* “It’s not often publicized, but Amazon does a brisk business in buying and selling used media and electronics. As at press time, Amazon’s parter merchants were offering as much as $500 for a like-new iPad 2 with 3G or $320 for a first-gen iPad, depending on features and conditions.”
* We can confirm that these prices are still currently valid. And if you act now, you could get as much as $150 more for your old tablet on Amazon as you could on eBay. Or $250 more than you would get from a standalone trade-in service like Gazelle.
* There is one major caveat, however. Amazon appears to be offering store credit only for tablet buy-backs, not cash. But if that doesn’t bother you, you should definitely check out the online retailer before shopping your old iPad around anywhere else.
