* Apple is shooting to release iOS 8.2 for public consumption next Monday, March 2, 2015, “or the following week at the absolute latest,” according to BGR editor Jonathan Geller who spoke to sources in the know.
* March 2 is a Monday, an unusual day for an iOS software update, but so is March 9 when Apple’s “Spring Forward” media event is due, at which it’s expected to talk Apple Watch specifics.
* Moreover, as many as four betas of iOS 8.3 could be issued before that software update is ready for public release, the BGR founder and editor has learned. He mentioned earlier in the month that iOS 8.2 would be arriving some time in March, but didn’t provide a timeframe.
* “We were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions,” he wrote. “Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.”
* iOS 8.2 should introduce pairing with an Apple Watch as well as bring out an Apple Watch Companion app ahead of the wearable’s release in April.
* iOS 8.3,  code-named Stowe, contains eight new Siri languages, new racially diverse emoji characters and other improvements.
* Moreover, iOS 8.3 is said to be provided as a public beta in mid-March. If true, the first 100,000 people who sign up for the new AppleSeed iOS program will be given access to the beta ahead of stable release later that month.
* Apple is also expected to release iOS 8.4 this summer.
* In addition to further under-the-hood improvements and optimization, that version of Apple’s mobile operating system should bundle a rumored new music streaming service directly inside the stock Music app.
