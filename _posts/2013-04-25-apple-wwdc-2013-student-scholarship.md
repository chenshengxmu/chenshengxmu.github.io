* Apple yesterday announced its annual developer conference, WWDC 2013, takes place at Moscone West in San Francisco from Monday, June 10 until Friday, June 14. With tickets for the last year’s WWDC selling out in less than two hours, Apple this time around won’t screw West Coast-based developers as tickets for the event go on sale today at 10am PDT via the WWDC web site.
* If you’re a poor student who can’t afford WWDC tickets running at $1,599 each, you may be eligible for Apple’s WWDC 2013 Student Scholarship where they are offering 150 free WWDC tickets to student developers with proven creativity and coding skills…
* Full or part-time students 13 years or older can apply via Apple’s WWDC 2013 Student Scholarship web page starting April 29 at 9am PDT. All applications must be submitted by May 2, 2013 at 5pm PDT.
* We want to reward creative, talented, and outstanding student developers with the opportunity to attend this year’s conference on a WWDC 2013 Student Scholarship.
* Participating students must be current members of the iOS Developer Program, iOS Developer University Program, iOS Developer Enterprise Program or Mac Developer Program.
* Apple cautions young devs that their example app should “highlight development projects you’ve worked on, your educational and professional background, technical skills and interests.”
