* Facebook has posted an update for its Pages Manager this week, bringing the app to version 2.2. The update includes some new tagging features, some performance improvements and an all new design for iOS 7.
* For those unfamiliar with Facebook’s Pages Manager, it allows admins to interact with their audiences and keep tabs on activity for their pages by doing things like viewing Insights and replying to private messages…
* Here’s the 2.2 change log:
* • Optimized for iOS 7 • Tag other Pages in sharing tool • Tag people in comments • Bug fixes and performance updates
* And a few more screenshots:

* While the update isn’t groundbreaking, it does bring the Manager more in line with Facebook’s other apps. The social network’s main client was redesigned for iOS 7 on day one, and Messenger got its makeover last month.
* The new tagging features are also probably pretty handy. So if you manage a Facebook Page, you’ll probably want to grab this update. Facebook Pages Manager is available in the App Store for the iPhone and iPad for free.
