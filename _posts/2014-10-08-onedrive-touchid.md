* Windows and Office maker Microsoft on Wednesday pushed a small but important update to OneDrive, its cloud storage client for the iPhone and iPad. The refreshed application enables users to lock content in the app using Touch ID-based fingerprint verification on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* The new OneDrive 4.5.1, a free 12.7-megabyte download from the App Store, also takes full advantage of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus,  lets you sort files and folders and includes bug fixes and stability improvements.
* Leveraging Apple’s Touch ID framework in iOS 8 for third-party integration, OneDrive can be protected with fingerprint-based authentication to sign in to the app.
* And to help prevent others from accidentally making changes to your files, you can now set up a PIN code. And as seen on the screenshots top of post, OneDrive at last makes it possible to sort the files and folders on your device.
* Lastly (you guessed right), OneDrive will no longer appear fuzzy on the bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens as Microsoft has gotten around adjusting the software to make use of the extra screen real estate.
* OneDrive 4.5.1 changelog:
* In related app news, Pocket and PDF Expert 5 both gained native support for the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus display sizes.
* OneDrive is available free in the App Store.
