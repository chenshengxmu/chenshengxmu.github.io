* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is out with a new report to clients Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, that lays out his predictions for Apple’s 2017 iPhone refresh. The analyst is calling for a trio of new iPhones next fall, two of which should be upgraded versions of the current models with classic TFT-LCD screens.
* As for a third model, it will boast all-new industrial design and utilize power-sipping organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology, according to the analyst’s note.
* The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 should have a single-lens camera like its iPhone 7 counterpart while its 5.5-inch brethren is expected to rock dual cameras, according to the analyst.
* The premium (and also very likely pricier) model should have dual cameras on the back and an OLED display on the front measuring 5.5 or 5.8 inches diagonally.
* Previous reports from Kuo and other sources alleged that Apple might opt for a curved “3D” cover glass and a flexible OLED panel like that seen on Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones, helping create skinnier side bezels.
* This is what the iPhone 8 lineup should be like, as per Kuo:
* From the report:
* We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model and two TFT-LCD models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature dual-camera. Based on this prediction, our forecast of dual camera adoption rate in new 2017 iPhone models is revised up from 30-40 percent to 65-75 percent.
* Other innovations like an in-screen Home/Touch ID button and putting the front camera and sensors behind the display itself are expected to result in drastically reduced top/bottom chins. Making those areas smaller than they are on current iPhones could permit Apple engineers to outfit the device with a 5.8-inch display without needing to enlarge the phone.
* Indeed, if you ask Barclays analysts the premium iPhone 8 model’s screen 5.8-inch will be extended “vertically as well as horizontally” without making the entire device bigger.
* As mentioned, the device should debut all-new industrial design with a glass on glass enclosure augmented by accentuated stainless steel edges. More than two-thirds of 2017 iPhones (between 65 and 75 percent) will have dual cameras, which will benefit a company called Largan that supplies lenses for the dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus.
* “We view this increase as favoring Largan’s sales and profit momentum as it is the exclusive supplier of wide-angle and telephoto lens. It also bodes well for Apple’s dual camera software ecosystem,” reads Kuo’s analysis.
