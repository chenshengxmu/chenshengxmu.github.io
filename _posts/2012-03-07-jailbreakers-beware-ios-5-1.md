* With today’s announcement, we’re pretty sure that iOS 5.1 will be right around the corner, with a probable release of the Gold Master sometimes this week.
* A few people on Twitter asked me to put up a friendly reminder that jailbreakers should make sure not to update to iOS 5.1 when it comes out, especially iPhone 4S owners…
* The Dev Team also posted a word of wisdom earlier today:
* If you care about your jailbreak, the safest thing to do right now it to save your SHSH blobs and make sure you don’t update to iOS 5.1 when it comes out.
