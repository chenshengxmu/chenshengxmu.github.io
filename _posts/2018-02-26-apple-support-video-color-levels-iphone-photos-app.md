* Did you know that you can easily make your photos pop just by spending some time experimenting with the various color sliders in the stock Photos app on your iPhone or iPad?
* In case you forgot about the recent image-editing advances put forth by iOS 11, and iOS 10 before that, Apple Support is here to remind you of the built-in color levels. Fire up the Photos app on your device, select an image, tap Edit and then hit an icon that looks like a sun.
* This will reveal the hidden color levels which permit you to independently adjust the photo’s various parameters such as light, color and B&W. Tapping one of these categories reveals several sliders that you can drag to adjust the photo’s appearance.
* Any changes you make to the color levels are easily revertible because the Photos app features non-destructive editing and always keep your originals intact.
* Do yourself a favor and spend some time interacting with these color levels to see how you can turn a dull image into a way more distinctive photo in just a few minutes.
* In the meantime, here are the three video tutorials from last week explaining how to shoot in black and white, how to take overhead pictures and how to adjust slo-mo timing.

* I personally love these types of videos.
* Which one is your favorite, and why?
