* Apple just announced its earnings for its September quarter, and despite all of the ‘doom’ talk and lowball analyst predictions, the numbers are actually pretty good. In fact, the company set a record for iPhone sales during the 3-month period.
* We’re just finishing up the conference call, where Tim Cook and his CFO Peter Oppenheimer talked about Apple’s performance, and offered some insight into its future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points for you…
* Overall, it seems like Apple had a solid Q4 thanks to the launch of its 2 new iPhones—iPhone sales make up over half its business. Admittedly, iPad sales are flat, and margins aren’t top-notch, but APPL is holding steady at $530 after hours.
* Looking forward, we’re anticipating Apple to have its largest holiday quarter ever, with new iPhones and iPads in stores across more markets than ever before. We’re also expecting a big 2014, with Tim Cook hinting at ‘new product categories.’
