* Looking for something to do this weekend? Well if you own an iPad, you’re in luck. Rovio, the studio behind the wildly popular Angry Birds franchise, has just put all of its iPad titles on sale.
* Everything from Angry Birds Star Wars, to Bad Piggies, to the physics puzzler Amazing Alex has been marked down to less than $1. We’ve got a full list of the discounts after the fold…
* Here are all of Rovio’s iPad games that are currently priced at $0.99:
* You’ll notice that Bad Piggies Best Egg Recipes is missing from the list. For some reason, it’s not included in the sale, but given that it’s more or less an egg cookbook, you probably won’t miss it.
* Otherwise, you’re looking at spending just $7 for 7 of some of the most popular games in the App Store—a price that’d you’d normally pay for just two of the titles. Not a bad deal if you ask me.
* There’s no word on when this sale is going to be over. So if you’re interested, you may not want to wait too long to act. All of the games are available in the App Store, just click on the direct links above.
