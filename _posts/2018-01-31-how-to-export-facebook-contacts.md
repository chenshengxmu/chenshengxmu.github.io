* If you have decided to delete your Facebook account and move on from the social network, there is some personal data that you’ll probably want to make sure you have saved to your computer first. For example, you’ll likely want to download a copy of the photos and videos you posted to Facebook, but also a copy of your contacts, including their names and phone numbers.
* Admittedly, Facebook doesn’t make it easy for you to get ahold of that info, and the data you get doesn’t even come in a convenient CSV or VCF file. Still, we’ll make the best of it.
* In this post, I will show you how to export your Facebook contacts to your computer so you can keep a backup of that data locally. Because the output is pretty messy, I will also show you how to clean up the contacts file provided by Facebook.
* As mentioned, Facebook doesn’t make it easy, but the company does provide a way to get an archive of your entire account. So if you want to get access to your contacts, you first have to request an archive of your Facebook account.

* You now have a copy of your Facebook contacts. Unfortunately, and because of the format, you won’t be able to easily port these contacts over to other applications, but at least you now have a back up of them.
