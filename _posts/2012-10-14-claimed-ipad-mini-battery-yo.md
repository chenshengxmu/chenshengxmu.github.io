* It seems like the long-rumored iPad mini might actually become a real thing this month. Multiple well-sourced reports are claiming that Apple is planning to unveil the tablet at an event on October 23.
* With that in mind, we expect to see speculation and part leaks really ramp up over the next few weeks as we await Apple’s announcement. In fact, today we’ve got photos of a purported iPad mini battery…

* The two images come from the folks over at MacRumors, who believe that the power supply in the photos belongs to Apple’s unannounced tablet. And according to its labeling, it’s of the 4490 mAh variety.
* “MacRumors has received a pair of photos showing what is claimed to be the battery from Apple’s forthcoming “iPad mini”. The photos show a battery carrying a model number of A1445 and an Apple part number of 616-0641. The battery runs at 3.72 volts, offering 16.7 Whr of energy on 4490 mAh of charge.”
* While the site obviously can’t confirm the part’s legitimacy, it does say that its external markings are consistent with those seen on batteries of Apple’s other products. Hey, it looks like the real deal to us.
* Interestingly enough, the battery in the iPhone 5 comes in at 1,440 mAh, with a 5.46 watt-hour capacity, and the iPad 3 at 11,666 mAh and 42.5 watt hours. So if this pack is legitimate, it’d fall in between the two.
* Honestly, it’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with battery life on this so-called iPad mini. Word is that it’s going to pitch the tablet as a media consumption device, so you’d think it’d have to be outstanding.
* We actually don’t know a whole lot about the rumored slate other than the fact that it’s said to have a 7.85-inch display, a slim form factor, and possibly the same anodized aluminum backing as the iPhone 5.
* Apple is expected to send out invitations for its iPad mini event sometime next week.
