* Fans of Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft will be happy to hear that you can now play the game on your iPhone. Blizzard pushed out an update today for the popular card battler that, among other improvements, brings about support for Apple’s handset.
* Blizzard says the new iPhone version features an all-new intuitive interface, handcrafted specifically for smaller mobile devices. Those devices, however, are limited to the iPhone 4s, or later models, or the fifth-generation iPod touch (iPad 2 for tablets).
* In addition to universal support, today’s Hearthstone update features several bug fixes. The release notes say the new firmware remedies an issue where cards were not awarded after Blackrock Mountain, and ‘Spectate Invite’ should now work for both sides.
* Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft originally launched for iPad in April of last year. For those who haven’t played the game, you collect strategy cards featuring characters and elements from the Warcraft universe, and then use them in 1-on-1 battles against others.
* Hearthstone is free-to-play, but note that it has tons of IAP offerings, and it’s available in the App Store here.
