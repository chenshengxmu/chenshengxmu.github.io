* We have released a detailed tutorial on how to jailbreak the GM developer build of iOS 4.3. Yesterday, Apple seeded the final developer build of iOS 4.3, and the public release of 4.3 will take place on March 11th.
* People are wondering if Apple has patched the current jailbreak exploits in their latest version of iOS. Because the iPad 2 runs on different hardware, it will almost definitely need a new exploit for an untethered jailbreak. As far as the iPhone and iPod goes, we’ll keep you updated…
* If you’re a registered Apple developer, you can jailbreak the iOS 4.3 GM build with PwnageTool 4.2.

* Our tutorial requires not only the developer GM build of iOS 4.3, but also a Universal Ramdisk Fixer and tetheredboot utility.
* Again, you cannot currently get your hands on iOS 4.3 if you are not a developer. And the PwnageTool jailbreak is tethered, which means that you will have to re-jailbreak every time you reboot.
* In our opinion, it’s not that big of a deal if the 4.3 GM can be jailbroken. What we’re really concerned about is the public release of 4.3 that’s coming next week. Hopefully we won’t have to wait for months before there’s an untethered jailbreak made available.
* You can read more about iOS 4.3 here.
* Do you think we’ll see an untethered iOS 4.3 jailbreak soon? iDB will be keeping you updated with the latest developments.
