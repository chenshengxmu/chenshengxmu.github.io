* Apple will start selling AirPods in its retail stores on Monday, reports MacRumors. Citing a retail source familiar with the matter, the outlet says the company has begun informing its stores about the imminent launch and has even started shipping inventory.
* The news follows the launch of AirPods online sales earlier this week, where shipping estimates quickly slipped beyond 4 weeks due to short supply. So for those hoping to score a pair of the wireless earbuds before Christmas, in-store is really your best bet.
* Apple announced the AirPods during its September iPhone 7 event, where it unveiled its first handset without a headphone jack and proclaimed that wireless was the future. The earbuds were expected to launch in late October, but were delayed several weeks.
* So are the AirPods destined to join the NES Classic, Hatchimals and other hot items this holiday season? We’ll see. Shipping times online still show 6 weeks out, but Apple says its stores will begin receiving regular shipments, as will authorized resellers.
