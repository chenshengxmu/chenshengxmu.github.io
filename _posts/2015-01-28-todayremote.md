* With Apple’s Remote app, you can access your computer’s iTunes playback controls so you don’t have to get off the couch to switch songs. But, unlocking your iPhone, opening the app, and selecting your device is still just way too much work.
* TodayRemote lets you control playback of iTunes right from the Lock screen of your iPhone. You’ll never have to work for your music again.
* The app adds a widget to your Today view in Notification Center that lets you play, pause, skip forward and back, and adjust the volume of anything you can play through iTunes.

* You’ll also need the companion Mac app available at TodayRemote.com. This app does not come from an identified developer. So, depending on your settings, you may have to allow this app through. After downloading it on the Mac, open finder and select it. Control-click on the app and select “open” from the dropdown menu. This will allow you to force-open the app, bypassing your security features.
* With the Mac helper installed, pair your device. Open the iOS app and select your Mac from the available list. You can do this with more than one Mac. Both computers will be available in Notification Center and you’ll be able to select which one you want to control.
* Then, in iTunes, select the track you’d like to play (I tested my music library, podcasts, movies, and iTunes Radio and all of them worked with TodayRemote). You can skip tracks, play previous ones, pause, and play. You can also adjust the volume of the iTunes app from your Lock screen.

* For $1.99, you can unlock additional features, which include support for Spotify, Rdio, Vox, and VLC, with support for additional players coming in the future.
* The PRO Features also include global OS X volume control. Instead of controlling only the volume of the iTunes app, you’ll also be able to control the volume of your Mac computer.
* TodayRemote is available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for free. Download it in the App Store today.
