* In addition to iOS 10 and tvOS 10, Apple also released the third beta of macOS Sierra to developers on Monday. The update is available for registered Mac developers in either the Updates tab of the Mac App Store, or in Apple’s Dev center.
* Today’s beta 3 release comes just about two weeks after Apple issued beta 2, and just a little more than a month after the original developer beta was made available. The software, of course, was first introduced during Apple’s WWDC keynote.
* Though Apple chose this year to rebrand OS X to macOS, the update isn’t a monumental one. There are just a few major new user-facing features including Siri for Mac, Universal Clipboard support, and Picture-in-Picture support via Safari 10.
* We are currently installing beta 3, and will be sure to report back with any notable changes. If you spot something we’ve missed, leave a comment below or emailus at tips@idownloadblog.com.
