* Usually, Apple’s S-upgrades are big on camera improvements and the just-released iPhone 5s doesn’t disappoint in this regard. Although past S-upgrades increased pixel count on the back camera sensor – the iPhone 4S, for instance, introduced an eight-megapixel iSight camera, up from five megapixels on the iPhone 4 – the iPhone 5s’s back shooter remains stuck at eight megapixels.
* But photography isn’t just about megapixels so Apple worked to improve low-light performance and the overal quality of your snaps, as well as enable new features like the super-slow motion video capture at 120 frames per second (stemming from the two-times faster 64-bit A7 chip).
* Cody has already laid out some of the crucial new camera capabilities and now Apple has posted a video which takes us through some of the technologies that make the iPhone 5s the best iPhone camera yet…
* Here it is.
