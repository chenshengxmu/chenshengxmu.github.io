* We previously heard that Plants vs. Zombies 2 will hit iOS later this month. Today, Seattle-based game publisher PopCap Games announced that the sequel to the widely popular franchise is coming to an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad near you on July 18.
* Unlike the original, the sequel will be released as a free download with the obligatory in-app purchases, but don’t worry – PopCap promises that the vast majority of the game will be entirely free to play. Go past the fold for more details and a brand new promo trailer…
* Here, check out the trailer.
* According to a media release, Plants vs. Zombies 2 will offer new worlds with new levels, plants, plant food that supercharges plants and zombies, along with brand new power-ups that let you “break the fourth wall” and interact with zombies directly, as well as via plant defenses.
* “New ways to play” will be released on an ongoing basis in the months and years following launch, PopCap claims.
* Here’s the blurb:
* Designed from the ground up as a live service, the ever-expanding universe of Plants vs. Zombies 2continues the epic struggle of plants defending your brainz against zombies from your backyard through the vast reaches of time, both past and future.
* The addled neighbor Crazy Dave is returning for the sequel to guide you as you purchase plant upgrades and other tools and weapons.
* The game will be release exclusively for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch on the App Store and previewed by invitation only at E3 in Los Angeles next week.
* In the meantime, grab a copy of the original Plants vs. Zombies game, which landed on the App Store in 2010 and ranked as Apple’s twelfth all-time paid iPhone app. Unlike the paid-for original game, the sequel will be offered as a free-to-play download.
* PopCap ensures that the vast majority of the game will be entirely free to play – you’ll be able to “face every zombie and access every level in every world” at no cost. Of course, hard-core gamers looking to maximize their score will be able to do so by purchasing upgrades and other in-game items.
* I must admit I’ve never been a huge fan of the series, but I’d love to hear whether you intend on giving Plants vs. Zombies 2 a try.
