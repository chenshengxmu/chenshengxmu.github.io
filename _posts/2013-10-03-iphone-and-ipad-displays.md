* Apple’s iPhone and iPad lines are both set to get larger displays, according to a new report from Korea’s ET news. The outlet claims to have knowledge of the company’s future product plans, and has outlined a series of sweeping changes.
* For starters, the report says that the iPhone is set to get a bump in display size to over 5-inches. And it goes on to explain that the iPad is going to get split into pro and entry-level models, with at least one model getting a 13-inch display…
* Here are some major bullet points from the lengthy report (via 9to5Mac):
* The report goes on to say that Apple is also working to implement more power-efficient LED displays for its MacBooks and that it is looking to increase its reliance on both LG and Samsung for screens, but will continue to use Japan Display.
* While there are previous reports that corroborate a few of these claims, some of them are unsubstantiated. For instance, this would be the third or fourth time we’ve heard of a 13-inch iPad—it sounds like Apple is going to go through with it.

* But as far as the iPhone getting a 5-inch display, we’ve heard that Apple has been looking at slightly less than that. The latest report calls for next year’s version of the smartphone to have a display size falling between 4.5 and 5-inches.
* And finally, regarding OLED displays, Apple has been seen hiring experts in the field. But Tim Cook has outright said that OLED technology does not measure up to the tech Apple currently uses. It does, however, make sense for the iWatch.
* So is any of this true? Well we shouldn’t have to wait too long to test the report’s accuracy. Later this month, Apple is expected to unveil a new iPad and iPad mini, and according to ET News, the latter won’t have a high resolution Retina display.
