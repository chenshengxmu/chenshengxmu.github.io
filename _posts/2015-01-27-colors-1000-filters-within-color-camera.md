* The trends of digital photography, especially mobile photography, ebb and flow like the changing interests of a teenager. One day, toy camera filters are all the rage and the next day, the #nofilter hashtag can be seen on everyone’s social networking page.
* Colors – 1000 Filters within Color Camera is a filter app with a huge variety of color options for you to choose from. It looks like crazy color filters are the new hotness for this season’s social photographs.

* Users open the app to the in-app camera feature and select the filter they would like to use. Switch between the different options by dragging your finger across the screen. Filters are added in real time. The “quick loading” feature, new filters only take a few seconds to load.
* You can keep your favorite filters at your fingertips by adding them to your favorites folder. Then, when you are ready to take a picture, you can scroll through the filters you like best instead of having to search through 1,000 filters.
* The in-app camera includes a time-lapse “selfie” feature that you can activate by pressing and holding the shutter button.

* Once you take a picture, you can crop it to get a close up or make it square. Add a frame from options like hearts, circles, smiley faces and more. Pick a background color for even more customization. Then, share it on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and more with just a few taps.
* Currently, you can only use the filters with real-time photos taken using the in-app camera. However, after receiving user requests for a post photo-editing feature, the app’s developers will be adding support for pictures in your camera roll in an update expected within a week.
* Colors – 1000 Filters within Color Camera is available for $0.99. You can download it in the App Store today.
