* After launching in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, China and Singapore, Apple Pay is about to make its debut in Switzerland on Monday, June 13, German-language financial outlet Finews reported this morning.
* It will reportedly be supported at launch by Swiss private bank Corner Bank but it’s unclear from the report whether major banks UBS and Credit Suisse will work with the service beginning next Monday.
* The rumor-mill thinks Apple Pay will land later this year in Spain, Hong Kong, India, France, Japan, Brazil and elsewhere. Former Netscape executive and currently Vice President of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, said recently that Apple had been “working rapidly” to bring the service to “every significant market”.
* The participating banks and store cards that are supported by Apple Pay are listed in Apple’s support document.
