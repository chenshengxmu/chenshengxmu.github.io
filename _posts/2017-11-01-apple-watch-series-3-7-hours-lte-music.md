* watchOS 4.1 was publicly released yesterday and brought a pair of new music-related features.
* You can now stream Apple Music, Beats 1 or any other Apple radio station over LTE on the latest cellular-eqipped Apple Watch Series 3 models. One of the biggest questions was what impact this would have on battery life.
* Here’s your answer:
* The Apple Watch battery documentation has been updated to reflect these latest figures.
* Tested with music playback from Apple Watch via Bluetooth. Testing conducted by Apple in August 2017 using preproduction Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) and Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular), each paired with an iPhone; all devices tested with prerelease software. Apple Music LTE streaming tested in October 2017 with a playlist and Beats 1 using the default cellular streaming quality setting.
* There you have it: streaming music over LTE should net about seven hours of listening time, compared to ten hours when you use the watch’s built-in storage. Streaming live radio over LTE has slightly worse numbers, coming in with only five hours of expected use time.
* If you happen to be outdoors doing a workout with everything enabled, battery takes an even bigger hit. If you have LTE, GPS and streaming audio while using a workout app, you should get up to three hours of use.
* That is about an hour less than a similar workout without the streaming audio.

* We went hands-on with these latest features and found them to be useful additions to the Apple Watch, especially for workouts when carrying a phone can be cumbersome.
