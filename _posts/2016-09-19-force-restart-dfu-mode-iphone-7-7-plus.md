* Every so often, iPhones have a brain fart and you may have to force them to restart or use DFU mode to restore because they either stop responding or start behaving sporadically.
* With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which no longer have a Home “button,” there is a new process to force restart your device or enter DFU mode. These are both essential parts of any troubleshooting process, so it’s good to know how how to do them.
* You may remember that holding down the Home button and the power button on all your previous iOS devices would cause your device to restart, and this was known as a hard restart.
* On the other hand, since the new Home button in the iPhone 7 & 7 Plus uses a taptic engine to provide button-like feedback and isn’t a true button, Apple moved its reset functionality over to the volume down button on the side of the handset.
* To force restart your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, simply press and hold the power button and the volume down button simultaneously for about 10 seconds, or until you see an Apple logo.
* At this point, your device should begin to reboot, and thanks to that zippy new quad-core A10 Fusion chip inside, it shouldn’t take very long to do so.
* DFU mode, another process that used to require using the Home button, has also been moved to the volume down button. The new process to enter DFU mode on your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is as follows:
* 1) Plug your device into your computer with a MFi-certified Lightning cable and launch iTunes.
* 2) Press and hold the power button and volume down button simultaneously until the display does dark.
* 3) When the display goes dark, you can release the power button and continue holding the volume down button until you see a prompt in iTunes that says your iPhone is in “Recovery Mode,” similarly to the one below:

* Note: At this point, if the screen is still black, you’re actually in DFU mode, not Recovery Mode. If you see an Apple logo or a connect to iTunes logo instead, then you goofed up the process and need to restart from step 1.
* At this point, you’re ready to restore your iPhone’s firmware through iTunes and this will perform a clean install of the latest version of iOS. You can also Shift/Alt click on the Restore button in iTunes to select and restore to any other firmware that is being signed by Apple.
* If you wanted to exit DFU mode after this process instead of restoring, all you would need to do is press and hold the power button and volume down button simultaneously until you see an Apple logo. At this point, the device will begin to reboot.
* Now that you’re aware of how to hard restart your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, as well as enter DFU mode on it, you should be prepared to handle any software issues that might occur during its service life.
