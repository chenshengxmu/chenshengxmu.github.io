* In addition to releasing OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, iOS 9.3.3 and watchOS 2.2.2 software updates, Apple this morning also posted a bug-fix tvOS release for the fourth-generation Apple TV. Available via the Software Update mechanisms in Settings → System → Software Update, the tvOS 9.2.2 software update packs in performance improvements, bug fixes and security enhancements found since the release of tvOS 9.2.1 two months ago.
* No new user-facing features are available in today’s tvOS 9.2.2 update. For security contents of this update, see Apple’s support document.
* Come this fall, Apple will release tvOS 10, a major update that will bring out new features like a Dark Mode, Single Sign-On for pay-TV apps, expanded Siri features with native YouTube voice search, a redesigned Remote app with Siri and tilt gaming support, Automatic Downloads for Apple TV apps, prompts to download companion apps for Bluetooth accessories, Live Tune-In and more.
