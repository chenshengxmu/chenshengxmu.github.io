* Heads up Pandora users, the internet streaming company pushed out a significant update to its iOS client last night. The update brings the app to version 4.0, and includes loads of new features and improvements.
* The app now supports the iPhone 5’s 4-inch display, and it also now offers new social network sharing options. So now you can tell your friends on Facebook and Twitter what song you’re jamming out to…
* From the change log:
* • Share your latest discoveries with friends on Pandora, Facebook, and Twitter • Discover new music by following others on the Music Feed • Re-discover your favorite music on your profile page • Explore the artists and music you love directly on your device • Full lyrics for the songs we play • Artist biographies and discographies • Detailed track features from the Music Genome Project • Find even more music you’ll love by adding variety to your stations • Enjoy constantly updated and expertly curated genre stations • Timer added to the track progress indicator – drag the player controls up to reveal the timer • Support for new BMW vehicles with the “BMW Apps” option, see bmwusa.com/apps for more details
* I’m not a frequent Pandora user, but the update seems to work as advertised. I like that it supports the iPhone 5‘s 4-inch display (where you at Spotify?), and the new Music Feed feature looks interesting.
* It is worth noting, though, that Pandora has identified a bug in the update that keeps iPads on iOS 6 from using the app in landscape mode. They promise to have a fix shortly, but iPads users should beware.
* Otherwise, if you’re interested in seeing the new Pandora for yourself, you can find it in the App Store for free. This is the ad-supported version, of course. It’ll cost you $3.99 per month to get rid of them.
* So, what do you think of the Pandora update?
