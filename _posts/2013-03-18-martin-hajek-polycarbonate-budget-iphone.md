* Another publication has commissioned Dutch concept artist Martin Hajek to bundle all the less-pricey iPhone rumors together in some plausible renderings. The 3D designer’s fresh batch of conceptual renderings imagine the rumored device in two flavors, one with a screen measuring four inches diagonally and the other sporting a larger 4.5-inch display.
* Hajek took into account credible talk of the budget iPhone adopting a polycarbonate shell, having combined that rumor with analysts speculating about some vivid colors, too. If you ever though using plastics would ruin the iPhone brand with unwanted and cheap feel to it, have a look at the images and think again…
* Our friends over at Dutch publication iPhoneclub have worked with Hajek on these gorgeous renderings.
* Here’s one depicting a four-inch budget iPhone in red (left) next to a white iPhone 5 (middle) next to a 4.5-inch version of the budget iPhone in iPod touch-like blue (right).

* The publication’s editor Bastiaan Vroegop told me via email:
* We’ve worked together with Martin to think of what the budget iPhone might look like. Based on that, we made two versions: a 4-inch iPhone (red) and a 4,5-inch iPhone (blue). Both are made out of polycarbonate and would be available in several colors, just like the latest iPod touch.
* Here’s from Martin, via his personal blog (he isn’t a native English speaker – hence his ignorance toward negative connotations to the adjective ‘cheap’):
* Adding colours and cheaper materials to the mix the visuals show that such a cheaper iPhone would look like a mix between the current iPod touch and iPhone 5.
* Here’s a nice side-by-side comparison between the supposed four and 4.5-inch models.

* Coincidentally or not, Apple is looking to hire plastics design engineers required for “new Apple product developments.”
* Now, some fans fear that by giving the budget iPhone a polycarbonate body the company will turn its iconic smartphone into a cheap product resembling the plasticky Galaxy smartphones.

* That’s a load of rubbish.
* Apple’s love for materials is legendary.
* I’m positive Tim Cook & Co. would never compromise the brand by creating a cheap-looking device just to save a few bucks. Besides, I don’t recall anyone complaining about ‘cheap’ feel to Apple’s phased out white polycarbonate body MacBooks, quite the contrary.
* The source article has a few other renders so check out iPhoneclub for some more Martin Hajek awesomeness.
* Martin Hajek is the brains behind the recently published iTV concept that Jony Ive would approve of and a bunch of other food-for-though imaginary Apple designs we love.
