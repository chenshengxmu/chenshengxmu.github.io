* For the Wallpapers of the Week collection, we typically focus on iOS devices and with the new iPhones launching in two days, there will be an entire iPhone 8 wallpaper series coming this week. In fact, I already have two complete iPhone 8 wallpaper packs ready for launch and need you to make more!
* But today, we give much love to desktops. With a tip from my buddy @guitrasher, I can provide you with an unlimited number of photo quality wallpapers, installed to your desktop, every hour. But how? Just a simple download from the App Store.
* I quickly grow tired of my desktop wallpapers, given I stare across at least two screens for about 10-12 hours per day. Although I get bored of the wallpapers, I rarely care to go find photo quality images, on a regular basis.
* The key here being, photo quality. You can stumble across any number of desktop wallpapers, even using a simple Google image search. But, what I desire, is a high quality curated list of exceptional wallpapers.
* Chatting with a fellow designer friend, @guitrasher, he recommended I look through unsplash.com for amazing imagery. Then, he recommended Irvue.app [download via Mac App Store] for macOS, to auto-cycle desktop wallpaper, using unsplash.com as the repository.

* Irvue leverages collections, artists, and individual images, to cycle your wallpaper every 30 minutes, hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, a week, 2 weeks, or month. Done. Simple. It will even allow you to setup multiple monitors, with different images on each. I gave this a spin with my three-monitor setup, thanks to Duet Display, and it worked flawlessly. Channels include new, featured, today, NASA, or others, found on the website.

* If you have an unsplash account, you can even sign-in, to like photos, create your own collections and add photos to those groupings from the Irvue app.
* I am using Irvue without an unsplash account, but love the ability to change my wallpapers frequently and have a different image automatically loaded to all monitors. As a collector of wallpapers, I also like the ability to quickly save images from the app, directly to a folder of my choosing. Currently, I save the images to a dedicated folder and have the macOS photo based screen saver, use only images saved out of that same folder. Smarter not harder.
* Spice up your desktop, every 30 minutes, with Irvue for macOS. Download it for free!
* If you have any tips/tricks or make/find some iPhone 8 wallpapers this week, you need to get up with me ASAP via @jim_gresham, where I’m compiling a list of updated wallpapers for our favorite new handsets!
