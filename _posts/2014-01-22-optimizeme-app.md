* Readers who frequent this blog may have figured by now that I’m a big fan of health and fitness apps for my iPhone. I’m especially fond of logging programs that tap Apple’s M7 motion coprocessor which lets my iPhone 5s record up to a week’s worth of motion data with a minimal impact on the battery.
* The problem is, the M7 folder on my Home screen is packed to the gills with apps.
* I use one app to track my steps taken and calories burned, another app to take care of my gym training, yet another program to monitor my sleeping habits… Then there are apps that track my entertainment activities such as movies and TV shows watched, programs that recognize places and track my activities with GPS – you get the idea.
* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was one app to rule them all? Enter OptimizeMe by German-developer OptimizeMe GmbH, now available free in the App Store…
* Created with the specific goal of tracking all your daily activities in a single app, OptimizeMe promises to bring all the lifelogging you’ll ever need.
* Want to track the time spent sleeping, commuting, working out?
* OptimizeMe does that.
* Integrate running, cycling, steps taken, calories burned and location (via Foursquare) data from the activity tracker app Moves by ProtoGeo?

* It does that as well.
* Log your mood, health status, sex life, quality of sleep, weight and other daily parameters, as well as tag folks, add photos and comments to your daily timeline?
* That, too!
* Actually, you can customize any activities and parameters you want to track and OptimizeMe will dutifully crunch your stats and produce personal insights from correlation data analysis. As a result, you’ll be able to tell how other people affect your mood, how work influences your health and lots more.
* There’s even a personal virtual life coach called Ari, who can help spot trends and reach your goals. Speaking of goals, OptimizeMe of course lets you set daily goals on a per-activity or per-parameter basis. Bringing it all together, it visualizes your progress and whole life by way of a nicely done selection of interactive charts.

* An app like this definitely cries for an iWatch.
* Apple’s health/fitness/wearable device is rumored to log people’s vital signs and key health-related data. On the software side, I’m guessing iWatch apps will also include beautiful visualization of a user’s life progress.
* Until iWatch comes out, OptimizeMe will keep me occupied.
* If you’re wondering about privacy, developers state that any user data “remains exclusively on your device” and won’t be shared with them or others unless you “actively chose to do so”.
* What are you waiting for?
* Go grab the free OptimizeMe app in the App Store now.
