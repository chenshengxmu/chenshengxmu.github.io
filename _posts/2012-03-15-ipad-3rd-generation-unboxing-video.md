title: iPad (3rd generation) unboxing video
---
* It’s here folks. The new iPad has touched down at iDownloadBlog, and we have an unboxing video just for you.
* We’re happy to report that it’s not much heavier or thicker than its predecessor — you probably won’t notice it — while the Retina display is as good as advertised.
* Stay tuned for more iPad 3 video goodness, and let us know what you think about our unboxing.
