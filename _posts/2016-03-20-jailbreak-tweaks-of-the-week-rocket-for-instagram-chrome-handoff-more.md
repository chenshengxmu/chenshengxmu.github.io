* After last week’s launch of an untethered jailbreak for iOS 9.1 by the Pangu jailbreak team, which couldn’t be extended to iOS 9.2 and later because the exploits were closed already, some more people have been given the chance to upgrade to a jailbroken device.
* As a result, we’re happy to make a roundup of all the jailbreak tweaks released this week so everyone can get up to speed with this week’s releases in a simple-to-follow list. First, we’ll show you our favorites this week, then we’ll go into all the rest.

* Chrome Handoff is one of our favorite jailbreak tweak releases this week that enables the native iOS Handoff feature for Google Chrome between your iOS devices and Mac.
* Typically disabled because Chrome isn’t a sandboxed app and because it’s not a Mac App Store app, this tweak allows users to enable the feature and pick up on one device where they may have left off on another.
* Because Google Chrome isn’t likely to ever become hosted in the Mac App Store due to restrictions, Chrome Handoff is a great solution that lets jailbreakers have their cake and eat it too.
* For more information on how Chrome Handoff works, you can check out our full review.

* Rocket for Instagram is another one of our favorite jailbreak tweak releases this week because it unlocked a wide range of features in the Instagram app that users will find incredibly useful. In addition, it includes a service you can take advantage of to increase your likes on your photos and videos.
* Among those are:
* Rocket for Instagram is covered in detail in our full review and we show you some examples of the tweak in action, as well as all of the options you can configure to make the tweak work the way you want it to.
* CCTools: Provides options for customizing Control Center to your liking (free – review)
* Glass: Increases transparency for the passcode screen, Folders, and more in iOS (free)
* MagicLabels: Lets you colorize your app and folder icon labels individually (free – review)
* SleekSwitcher: Gives you more blur options for the App Switcher background (free)
* WAShowPreview: Enables previews in in WhatsApp notifications for unsupported devices (free)
* Wolfram: Forces Low Power Mode while your device charges so it charged more quickly (free – review)
* That’s about all there is for this week, but if you missed last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup, you can still learn more about recent jailbreak tweak releases.
* Also, don’t forget to update your Pangu untether package from Cydia if you haven’t already!
