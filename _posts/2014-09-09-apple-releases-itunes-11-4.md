* Apple this afternoon released iTunes 11.4 for Mac OS X users. The update is small in size, but significant in terms of functionality, as it brings about support for syncing music, movies and other iTunes content to iOS devices that have upgraded to iOS 8.
* The news follows the seeding of iOS 8 GM to developers earlier today, which will be the software’s final release before it goes public later this month. That update was also fairly minor, offering up just a handful of tweaks for icons and other UI elements.
* iOS 8 will become available to everyone (with compatible devices of course) on September 17th. Apple is also working on a brand new, redesigned version of iTunes, iTunes 12, which is expected to launch alongside OS X Yosemite sometime next month.
