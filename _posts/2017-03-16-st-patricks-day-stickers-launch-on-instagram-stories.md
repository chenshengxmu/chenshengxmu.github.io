* Yesterday was the Saint Patrick’s Day, a cultural and religious celebration held on the traditional death date of Saint Patrick who was the foremost patron saint of Ireland. To celebrate the festivities, Instagram has added a handful of themed stickers which you can plaster all over the photos and videos in your Stories. They’re available in the United States, Ireland, Australia and the United Kingdom through the weekend so go ahead and dazzle your followers with St. Patrick’s Day-themed Stories.
* Following the introduction of stickers in December 2016, Instagram has regularly added special sticker packs for events and holidays like Valentine’s Day.

* Recently, Instagram rolled out an early version of geostickers in Stories, but only for New York City and Jakarta. Instagram’s geostickers are pretty popular and people often use these visual accessories to highlight their present location, down to the neighborhood.
* Grab Instagram for iPhone and iPad from App Store at no charge.
