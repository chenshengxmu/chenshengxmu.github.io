* Ending weeks of speculation, Apple on Thursday at last gave us a number: Apple Music has signed up eleven million people for its three-month free trial, one month after the new music service debuted. The number was officially revealed by Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services in a statement to USA Today, who said “We’re thrilled with the numbers so far.”
* The number is roughly in line with the ten million estimate that HITS Daily Double revealed last week, based on Apple’s streaming statistics shared with rights holders.
* By comparison, Spotify has 75 million total users but only 25 million paying customers so assuming all current Apple Music accounts are converted into paying customers after the trial expires in October, Apple would have half the paid memberships of Spotify.
* That, of course, won’t be the case but it’s worth mentioning that Apple Music has only been on the market for a month while Spotify has been operating for nearly a decade now.
* Apple Music costs $9.99 per month after the trial period, or $14.99 for families of six. If our non-scientific poll is anything to go by, one out of each four users who signed up for free trial plan on continuing to pay for Apple Music once their trial expires.
* Will you continue using Apple Music past the 3-month trial?
* An additional one-third of respondents said they have yet to make up their mind about keeping Apple Music after the trial.
