* One of the best things about choosing a Verizon flavored iPad over its AT&T counterpart is the fact that Verizon makes tethering your data free.
* Right out of the box you can start tethering your iPad’s fast LTE connection to another iPad, iPhone, Mac, PC, whatever.
* Inside we’ll take a look at how to setup the personal hotspot feature on your new iPad, along with a little test drive…
* As you can see, Verizon’s service is no slouch when it comes to speed. I’ve seen it slow down a bit since more and more users have adopted new Verizon iPads, but it’s still much better than I would have imagined. It’s already about 3-4 times faster than my “high speed” broadband upload speed at home.
* Did you buy a Verizon iPad? If so, will you be taking advantage of the free hotspot provision?
