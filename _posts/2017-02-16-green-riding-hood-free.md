* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app Green Riding Hood. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pick up this popular title for free on both iPhone and iPad—a nice savings of $3.
* Green Riding Hood is an interactive storybook aimed at helping children develop healthy habits. It’s chock-full of beautiful graphics, fun-to-play mini games, and amusing storyline that puts a modern twist on the classic fairytale.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Recasting Grandma as an herbal tea-sipping yoga teacher is just one of the fun ways this gorgeous storybook encourages kids to develop healthy habits. (You’ll love Bobaka’s take on the big, not-so-bad Wolf, too.) We’re having a ball exploring each interactive page, and the app’s tasty vegetarian recipes make great projects for the whole family.
* And here is a clip of the app in action:
* Green Riding Hood is available in the App Store for free.
