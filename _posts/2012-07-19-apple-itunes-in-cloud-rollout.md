* Apple sure has been busy today. Hot on the heels of this morning’s iTunes Match expansion, it appears that the company has added movies to its iTunes in the Cloud feature for users in 30+ new countries.
* Folks from the UK, Ireland, Brazil and other areas are reporting that they are now able to stream previously-purchased films to their iOS devices, using iCloud. Keep reading to see if your country made the list…
* MacRumors has used its extensive readership to compile a list of all of the countries that are reportedly seeing the new feature:
* Movies for iTunes in the Cloud works just like apps and music do. Essentially, any movies you’ve previously purchased through iTunes (although it looks like there are some exceptions) should be re-downloadable on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.
* So if you live in one of the aforementioned areas, and have purchased movies in iTunes before, try re-downloading them. And be sure to let us know if it’s working for you down in the comments.
