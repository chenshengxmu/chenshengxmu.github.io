* Good news gamers, Chair Entertainment is offering Infinity Blade free as a limited time Black Friday special this week. The game, which normally retails for $5.99, supports a wide range of iOS devices dating back to the iPad and iPhone 3GS.
* This was the first mobile game powered by Epic’s Unreal Engine 3 technology, giving it gorgeous visuals and a fully 3D castle realm. And for those that haven’t played it yet, this is your chance to see where the Infinity Blade series began…
* From the App Store description:
* “For untold ages, the God King has ruled with an iron fist – his power is incalculable; his followers, legion. Now you must journey to the Dark Citadel to battle his Titans, one by one, until you face the tyrant himself. As it has been for all in your bloodline, this is your birthright – to free your people from an endless legacy of darkness. The immortal can be vanquished – but only if heart, mind, and steel are one.”
* And the original game trailer:
* The first version of Infinity Blade was awarded a 2011 Apple Design Award, and took home more than 20 “Game of the Year” & “Top App” awards. It was considered by many to be the first console-quality titles on Apple’s mobile iOS platform.
* There’s no word on when this deal will expire, but considering it’s labeled a ‘Black Friday’ special, we expect it to last through the weekend. If you’re interested, you can grab Infinity Blade in the App Store by clicking here.
* Like the first one? You can download Infinity Blade II here and Infinity Blade III here, for $6.99 each.
