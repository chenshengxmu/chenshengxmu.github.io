* Specifically, developers can showcase their content with subtitles, promotional text, additional app previews that they can localize and up to 20 promoted In-App Purchases that users can buy on App Store, even if they haven’t downloaded an app that offers them.
* A dedicated section on Apple’s portal for developers offers useful resources for making the most of the new product pages. Like before, new metadata is entered in iTunes Connect.
* “Metadata you provide in iTunes Connect is shared across App Store on iOS 11 and iOS 10.3 and earlier, so you only need one version of product page elements, such as app name, icon, screenshots and keywords,” notes Apple.
* iOS 11’s App Store features competently revamped product pages while providing dedicated Apps and Games tabs along with a new Today tab with original stories, editorial, tips, how-tos, interviews and more, updated daily, in a blog-like format.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube.
* The App Store redesign lets developers spotlight apps with more engaging content, putting the most important information front and center for the customer making a download decision.
* Developers can now submit up to three video app previews and five screenshots, which can now be localized so a user in any country can have a customized version of the video.
* Accolades including Editors’ Choice and chart position are now highlighted by App Store, as are In-App Purchases and customer ratings and reviews.
* The new App Store is now available as a preview to users of the iOS 11 public beta. Once iOS 11 launches for public consumption this fall, the redesigned App Store will be in the hands of hundreds of millions of users around the world.
* App Store customers have now downloaded more than 180 billion apps and Apple has paid out over $70 billion to developers since the store launched in 2008, making it the most vibrant software marketplace in the world, according to the Cupertino giant.
