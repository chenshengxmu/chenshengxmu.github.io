* I’m not one of those calorie counting fitness fanatics. I just really hate buying clothes and don’t want to have to purchase larger sized pants. In order to stay the same size and squeeze into my two-year-old jeans, I try to keep my eating habits and exercise routine as regular as possible.
* However, from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day, I go off the wagon in a big way. Whether I’m guzzling eggnog by the gallon or munching on Christmas cookies, there is nothing stopping me from over-indulging for the holiday season.
* If you are like me, you are probably going to need to invest in some quality fitness apps to shed the extra pounds in the New Year. The writers of iDownloadBlog have created a list of the 10 best health and fitness apps of 2013. Check them out and let us know which is your favorite for our Best Apps of 2013 list…
* You’d be surprised how many steps per day you walk when you aren’t even trying to exercise. To keep track of your daily movement, get yourself a pedometer. Even better, download this app if you have an iPhone 5s and let it track your movement for you. You can adjust the gender and height and select a daily step goal. If you haven’t reached your goal by the end of the day, go for a special walk to catch up. You can even turn on the step counter badge and see how many steps you’ve taken without even opening the app. This app is available for free (requires iPhone 5s).

* This was one of the most hyped apps to make use of Apple’s new M7 coprocessor. Nike makes it possible for you to capture your every move and keep you active. Not only can you track your steps, but with Nike+ Move, you can also measure a wide variety of activities. See when you are most active and increase movement during the slower times. Get a breakdown of running, walking, and sitting. See your movement on a map to track your most active moments. Enter your age, gender, and height to plan your exercise routine. This app is available for free (requires iPhone 5s).

* I know we are going to get a bit of guff from some of you for including this app because it technically didn’t come out in 2013. However, it was so well liked amongst the writers since its 2013 complete redesign that we decided to include it anyway. What makes Moves special is that, when everyone else is making apps exclusively for the iPhone 5s, this one still makes it possible for old dogs to keep track of their movements. Using GPS and your device’s accelerometer, your running, jogging, and cycling exercises are at your fingertips. If you do have an iPhone 5s, you can also track all of your daily movement. This app is on sale for $0.99 (regularly $2.99).

* Nike might have been one of the first to use the M7 coprocessor, but Argus is THE first app to use the motion detection technology on the iPhone 5s. This app features a multitude of ways to track your daily activity. You can keep track of your movement, sleep, food intake, water consumption, and more. Set a goal for maintaining each of your activities and enter pertinent data each day. See all of your health and fitness activity in one convenient honeycomb patterned display. This app includes a step tracker, calorie counter, GPS reader, food diary (including pictures), and more. As you track your activities, see your daily, weekly, and monthly trends on a graph. This app is available for $1.99.

* This specialized training app makes it possible for you to track each of your workout sessions. With an interactive real-time tracker, you’ll be able to tailor your sessions to your daily routine. The sessions evolve as you do. So, if 200 sit-ups start to get to be too easy, you can increase your workout plan accordingly. The app features motion capture 3-D animations that lead you through every exercise. You can even rotate the view to see your workout from every angle. Everyone progresses at a different rate and with UniqueTrainer, you can keep your workout compatible with your progress. This app is available for $1.99.

* This app is based on the “Scientific 7-Minute Workout” but has been tweaked just a little. Instead of forcing everyone to fit into one workout, this app has been fine-tuned to make it possible for users of all fitness levels to take advantage of the high-impact workout safely and effectively. There are 200 unique exercises, each with its own video, coaching points, and an interactive voice coach. If you are on the road, you can still workout with more than 100 bodyweight related exercises. Personalize your workout by mixing and matching daily seven-minute routines. This app is available for $1.99.

* Stretching is a very important part of staying fit and protecting your body from strained muscles. Even if you don’t exercise at all, stretching should be part of your morning routine. This app features more than 150 different dynamic stretches, which are full movement stretching routines that help increase blood flow, reduce tightness, and help you improve your athletic performance. If you are running, cycling, rowing, or following a high-impact workout regimen, Performance Stretching will help you get the most out of your muscles. This app is available for $2.99.

* Nothing is more important to your health and fitness than getting a good night’s sleep. If you ask around, you’ll discover that the average person does not get enough daily rest. Even if you can’t sleep for six hours per night, you can keep your mind rested with daily meditation sessions. You don’t have to get on the floor in the lotus position in your office in order to relax your mind. Take 15 minutes per day to turn off your stress and go to a comfortable place in your mind with the natural sounds of Relaxia. Choose from rain and thunder, beach sounds, underwater ocean life, fire, and forests. Set a timer and either let the sounds of nature lull you to sleep or calm your mind for the day ahead. This app is available for $1.99.

* Having a professional football player as your personal trainer may have been something you only dreamed about in the past, but not anymore. Even if you’ve never held a football, you can get a workout that is right for you. Start by participating in the beginning training sessions and rate each exercise based on how difficult it was for you to complete. Then, based on your activity, a workout routine will be offered to you. You can purchase workout packages based on how committed you are to spending time with the program. If you only want a five minute warm up routine each day, spend a few dollars on the “Daily Dose” program. If you are ready to turn mass into muscle for the long haul, purchase the “Get Committed” program for $29.99. This app is available for the iPad for free.

* One section of the body that most people complain about not being happy with on their own body is the stomach. No matter how much we workout or how far we run, it seems like our bellies still jiggle like a bowl full of jelly. Runtastic offers the perfect workout for tummy tuckers of all levels. Whether you want abs of steal, or just to stop hanging out over your pants, you’ll find the right exercise routine to make your mid section look the way you’ve always wanted it to. There are more than 50 instructional videos with dozens of pre-defined workouts. You can customize your workout to target areas you want to work on the most. This app is available for $1.99.
