* With the release of iOS 4, AT&T finally allowed internet tethering on the iPhone. Because there is no jailbreak for the iPhone 4 yet, we cannot use apps like MyWi to tether your iPhone or even turn it into a wireless hotspot.
* So far, if you want to tether your iPhone 4, you’re gonna have to play fair and deal with AT&T. Tethering on your iPhone 4 will come at a hefty price of $20/month plus $25/month for the 2 GB DataPro plan by AT&T. That’s a complete rip off but that’s the only solution to date.
* If you’re not turned off yet, here is what you have to do to set up internet tethering on your iPhone 4:
* UPDATE: This post is outdated. Check out this page for the latest information about iPhone tethering.
* Step 1: Go to Settings > General > Network > Set up internet tethering.
* Step 2: A message will show up telling you that you have to call or visit AT&T’s website to enable tethering. Either call them or go to your account online to activate the option.
* Step 3: Reboot your iPhone.
* Step 4: Plug your iPhone in your computer.
* Step 5: Go to Settings > General > Network > Internet Tethering > On. Now either choose to tether via USB or Bluetooth.
* Step 6: Choose “iPhone” from the list of available networks on your computer.
* Step 7: Enjoy the interweb!
* As I said above, AT&T prices for this option are outrageous. If you’re on a jailbroken iPhone 3G or 3GS you can always tether your iPhone for free using MyWi.
