* With nearly sixty million copies sold across all platforms, Mojang’s Minecraft is quite a phenomenon. And now, the highly-anticipated update to the game has landed on the App Store.
* Now available for $6.99 in the App Store, Minecraft – Pocket Edition version 0.9.0 for the iPhone and iPad vastly enhances the popular blocky sandbox game with the addition of infinite world size, new monsters and caves, a bunch of new blocks to work with, new places to explore and much more…
* Perhaps even more importantly, the update includes a UI tweak in the form of a new “interaction” button which solves the annoying issue where you would accidentally dig terrain or punch a sheep.
* For the uninitiated, Minecraft is a sandbox game with the intentionally blocky graphics where everything can be manipulated to your liking.
* Just like LEGO bricks, you have complete control over almost every object and aspect of the game so small wonder that the immensely popular game is available across all popular desktop, mobile and console platforms.

* Filed as the biggest Minecraft update ever, the new version also brings a number of other enhancements and nice-to-haves making your experience more pleasing.
* If you haven’t played Minecraft yet, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try, but beware – the game is highly addictive. If you’re not into slow-paced games, don’t worry as Minecraft features a Survival mode (in addition to Creative mode) where the goal is to survive by building shelter, eating food, killing enemies and more.
* Release notes mention the following changes and improvements:
* Minecraft was originally created by Swedish programmer Markus “Notch” Persson and later developed and published by Mojang.
