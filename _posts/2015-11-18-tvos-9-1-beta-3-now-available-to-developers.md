* In addition to releasing iOS 9.2 beta 4 to developers and public beta testers, Apple on Wednesday also released a third beta of tvOS 9.1 to developers, its operating system for the fourth-generation Apple TV.
* The tvOS 9.1 beta 3 update (build number: 13U5077a) is available over-the-air on the new Apple TV to developers who are on a prior tvOS beta, as well as a standalone download through Apple’s portal for developers.
* This update doesn’t appear to bring out any new user-centric features. Apple is asking developers to focus on a number of known issues, suggesting there’s still work to be done before a final release is ready.
* Release notes accompanying the download state that the tvOS 9.1 includes bug fixes and improvements in the OS and SDK, including in AVKit, On Demand Resources and UIKit.
* tvOS 9.0.1, the first software update for the new Apple TV, released for public consumption shortly after the new box hit the market in early November.
