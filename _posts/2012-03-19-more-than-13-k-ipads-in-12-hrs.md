* Earlier today, both AT&T and Apple announced that they saw record-breaking iPad sales over the weekend. Neither company, however, gave any kind of specific sales figures.
* So while everyone is speculating — we’ve heard it’s well over a million — The Verge has gotten some ballpark estimates from the popular Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City…
* “Here’s what we’re hearing: within the first 12 hours of the iPad’s launch — between 8AM and 8PM local time — the store sold over 13,000 new iPads, an average of about 18 per minute. Daily store revenue, which typically falls between $700,000 to $1 million this quarter, was up to $11.5 million on launch day. “
* Wow, selling nearly 20 iPads a minute for 12 straight hours is quite a feat — especially for a single retail location. But perhaps even more interesting is the fact that the Fifth Avenue store had that kind of inventory on hand.
* Last year, retailers saw almost immediate supply shortages after the iPad 2 launch, receiving only a handful of units per day for about a week before the tablets were completely sold out. Apple was obviously a bit more prepared this time around.
* This might also explain why some news outlets are reporting a lack of demand for the new iPad, as several resellers around the country are claiming to still have inventory left. For what it’s worth, I visited our local Apple Store in Portland, Oregon, and then another one in Seattle, Washington over the weekend, and both had lines out the door.
* It’ll be interesting to see how many tablets Apple sells this quarter, considering it’s coming off a record-breaking holiday period. We should hear those numbers during the company’s earnings call sometime next month.
