* Wow, just when you thought T-Mobile couldn’t get any crazier, it goes and does something like this. As CEO John Leger hinted last week, the [un-]carrier has finally landed Apple’s iPad, but there’s a big twist.
* Apparently, T-Mobile will be offering an entry-level data package with 200 MB free of charge alongside the tablet. And of course, higher-limit packages will be available too, starting at $30/month for 2.5 GB…
* Here is the plan, as well as other options, listed on Apple’s website:

* While T-Mobile customers have always been able to use GSM iPads with their SIM cards, this is the first time they’ll be able to buy them directly from their carrier, allowing them to take advantage of all the features.
* Yep! @TMobile will be carrying the iPad, and I’ve got an idea on how to make it #uncarrier. Stand by!

* The new iPad Air will be available on November 1, starting at $629 for the 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model, and the new mini in ‘November’ starting at $529. For more information on pricing and availability, click here.
