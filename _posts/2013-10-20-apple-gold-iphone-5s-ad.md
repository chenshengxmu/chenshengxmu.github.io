* Following the publishing of its first print ads for the iPhone 5S last week, Apple has begun running its first TV spot for the handset. The commercial popped up just a few moments ago during a football broadcast on FOX.
* The advert is reminiscent of Apple’s recent ‘Plastic Perfected’ iPhone 5c ad, in that it shows liquid coming together to form the flagship smartphone while the track “Ooh La La” by Goldfrapp plays in the background…
* Update: Apple has added the commercial to its YouTube channel and website.
