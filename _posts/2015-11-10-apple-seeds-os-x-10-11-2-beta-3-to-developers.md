* In addition to beta 3 of iOS 9.2, Apple also released the third beta of OS X 10.11.2 on Tuesday. The update is labeled build 15c40a, and is available to registered developers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store or through Apple’s Developer Center.
* Today’s release comes just one week after Apple pushed out beta 2 of OS X 10.11.2 to developers and public testers, suggesting the firmware is nearing completion. It has been 3 weeks since the last public update to OS X (10.11.1), which added 150 new emoji.
* There’s no word yet on what changes OS X 10.11.2 will bring, but we do know Apple has asked developers to focus on Graphics, Mail, Wi-Fi, Calendar, Notes, Photos, and Spotlight. We’re installing the beta now, and will be sure to pass on any major revelations.
