* Just like the familiar Settings application on an iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, OS X’s System Preferences is probably the most frequently used application on your Mac.
* If you’re new to the Mac, System Preferences—much like the Control Panel on Windows—is a one-stop shop for adjusting various settings on your computer. Various settings are categorized into logical sections and laid out as a grid of  preference pane icons.
* In this post, we’re going to outline five different time-saving ways to jump quickly into any specific setting nested within System Preferences.
* Most people launch System Preference from the Dock and then navigate its interface the old-fashioned way. But if you know where a setting is located beforehand, why not save yourself a few clicks and jump straight to it, directly from the Dock?
* Step 1: Click and hold the System Preferences icon in the Dock. A contextual menu will pop up and populate with the available preference panes.

* Step 2: Highlight a desired preference pane in the menu and let go the mouse button. System Preferences launches immediately, taking you to the appropriate setting.

* System Preferences includes a Show All button which takes you back to the main view of preference icons from wherever you happen to be in System Preferences.

* But as it turns out, this button does more than that.
* Step 1: Launch System Preferences on your Mac.
* Step 2: Navigate to any setting section or sub-section you like.
* Step 3: Say you now want to jump to a different preference pane. Just click and hold the Show All button to see the available preference icons in a pop-up list.

* Step 4: Highlight one, let go the mouse button and you’ll jump straight to it.
* Have you noticed a handy search box in the top-right of the System Preferences window? It’s for locating related settings on your Mac quickly and effortlessly.
* Step 1: Launch System Preferences on your Mac.
* Step 2: Type a term in the search field located in the top right.

* As you type, possible matches for what you’re looking for appear below the search field, and one or more preference icons are spotlighted in the System Preferences window.

* In addition to built-in search, you can land on specific preference panes right from your Mac’s global Spotlight search—because life is too short.
* Step 1: Press Command (⌘) – Space to open Spotlight and start a search. Type your search term like you would into the built-in System Preferences search.

* Step 2: Use up and down arrow keys to select a desired preference pane in Spotlight search results, and hit Enter.
* Tip: To prevent Spotlight from searching certain apps, including System Preferences itself, go to System Preferences → Spotlight → Search Results and uptick checkboxes next to apps you want excluded from the system-wide search feature.

* Any pane or setting surfaced within System Preferences’ embedded search field can also be pinpointed with ease through OS X’s system-wide Spotlight search.
* As pointed out by Dave Mark of The Loop, a commenter has said that you can jump to some (but not all) System Preference panes quickly by pressing the Option (⌥) key and one of the function keys on the keyboard.
* A few examples: Option-pressing the brightness function keys (F1 and F2) launches the Displays preference pane. Option-volume (F10, F11 and F12) brings up the Sound preference pane. Option-F3 launches Mission Control settings and Option-pressing the backlight function keys on the keyboard (F5 and F6) opens the Keyboard pane, and so on.
* Should you have further questions about using the aforementioned methods to quickly locate specific settings on your Mac, this mini-FAQ will come to the rescue.
* Of course, simply describe what you want (i.e. to share a printer with other computers, type “share printer”). You can even use Windows-friendly terms. For instance, searching for ‘wallpaper’ surfaces the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
* In a word, no. If you hide some icons from your System Preferences view you’ll still be able to find hidden settings through Spotlight or System Preferences search.

* As evidenced above, I hid the top row of preference icons (General, Desktop & Screen Saver, Dock and so forth), and yet could locate settings for desktop pictures via Spotlight and System Preferences search.
* Again, no.
* System Preferences and Spotlight take queries that don’t match official setting labels 100 percent. This lets you type a word or phrase that describes what you want to do, instead of having to recall the specific setting name.
* As mentioned before, former Windows users can search for ‘wallpaper’ (the term officially used on Windows) and System Preferences will point them to the appropriate sub-section within the Desktop & Screen Saver preference pane.

* But it goes even deeper than that. In the following example, I typed ‘windows’ and got results for adjusting features like Windows networking and file sharing, restoring windows in Finder, Exposé shortcuts and more.

* Regardless of how generic your queries might be, System Preferences and Spotlight will do their best to surface results that could be useful. In another example, I typed the word ‘search’ and saw results for search domains, Spotlight search categories and an option to block search of private files within Spotlight.

* On a final note, your view of System Preferences may differ from mine because setting icons vary depending on your system and any apps you have installed.
