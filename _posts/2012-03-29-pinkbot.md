title: If the Pink Panther used Tweetbot this is how he would do it

* Pinkbot is a WinterBoard theme (we know, bleh) that allows you to alter Tweetbot with various pink UI elements.
* If the Pink Panther ever decided to use an iPhone, this would be his Twitter client of choice…
* I must say, I’m not really feeling the look of it. Not only that, but the fact that this uses WinterBoard is a deal breaker to me. Maybe if I installed it on my iPhone 4S it would be different, but WinterBoard bottlenecks the iPhone 4 from my experiences with it.
* You can find Pinkbot on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for free. What do you think?
