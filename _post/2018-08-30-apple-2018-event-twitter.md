* Update: It’s official! This year’s event will be held on Wednesday, Sept. 12. 
* The U.S. Labor Day holiday is just days away, which means Apple’s annual iPhone press event shouldn’t be far behind. Though Cupertino has yet to officially announce the event, all eyes point to Wednesday, Sept. 12 as the big day. Now comes word the hardware-focused event could be Apple’s first to stream through Twitter.
* According to BGR, Apple will stream the iPhone event live on the social network both at Twitter.com and through any of the various Twitter mobile apps. No doubt such a move would give Apple a much bigger audience that it has generated for past events. In recent years, Apple provides live streaming of its media events through Apple.com and on Apple TV.
* BGR isn’t the first site to suggest Apple’s planning to hold its next event on Sept. 12. Earlier this week, French radio station Europe 1 cited its own sources in announcing the event would be on Sept. 12 at 10 a.m. PDT at the Steve Jobs Theater.
* On Aug. 1, CNET became the first media outlet to propose Sept. 12 as the date for the event. It looked at the scheduling of past events as they related to the date of Labor Day (always the first Monday in September) to come up with the date.
* Bringing coverage to this year’s event to Twitter makes sense given what’s at stake.
* Until now, Apple has only revealed two new hardware products in 2018, the 2018 budget iPad and 2018 MacBook Pro. This Fall, the company is expected to launch three new iPhones, a pair of new iPad Pro tablets, and the fourth-generation Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple’s on track to introduce a new MacBook and MacBook Air, a next-generation Mac mini, and perhaps an updated iMac. The long-delayed AirPower wireless charger is also expected to arrive alongside second-generation AirPods.
* Hopefully, we’ll hear more very soon.
* Which new Apple product would you like to see the most make its debut next month? Let us know in the comments below.
