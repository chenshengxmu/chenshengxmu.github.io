* Apple officially unveiled its new connector called Lightning today at their iPhone press conference, just as the rumors suggested they would.
* The new connector can be plugged in either way for ease of use, it’s 80% smaller, and all digital. It’ll no doubt compliment the new smaller form factor of the iPhone 5.The new connector is also said to be more durable, adaptive, and has an improved interface.
* First we had Thunderbolt, and now we have Lightning.
* But what if you have an older peripheral — which all of us, no doubt, do? Apple has addressed that issue with an adapter that interfaces between the iPhone, and the older 30 pin dock standard.

* It’s not the prettiest solution in the world, but it should hold us over in the interim. What do you think?
