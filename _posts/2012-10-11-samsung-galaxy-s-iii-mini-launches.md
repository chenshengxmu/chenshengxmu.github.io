* In a twist of self-inflicted irony, South Korea-based Samsung today launched a smaller version of its flagship Galaxy S III handset, giving it a four-inch display instead of a whopping 4.8-inch screen found on the original. This is the same company which readily slams Apple in advertising over the iPhone 5’s four-inch display which the ads suggest isn’t massive enough for people’s tastes.
* Well, guess what? Looks like four inches is the perfect screen size for the new Galaxy S III Mini. This Jelly Bean-driven smartphone with Samsung’s TouchWiz interface inherits much of the Galaxy S III’s software and hardware features and appears to be aimed squarely at the iPhone 5…
* Samsung’s media release quotes mobile head JK Shin who said the goal was to bring the Galaxy S III’s “revolutionary design, intuitive usability and intelligence to the Galaxy S III mini in a more compact form”.
* Compact it is.

* The Mini is 121.55mm wide, 63mm tall and 9.85 deep. Compared to the S III, the Mini is 15.5mm narrower, 7.6mm smaller and a millimeter thinner. It should also feel lighter in your hand, weighing in at 111.5g (the S III is 133g.
* Its display is based on the same Super AMOLED technology that the S III uses, sans a lower resolution of 800-by-480 pixels versus a 1,280-by-720 pixel display on the S III.
* Unlike its bigger brother, the Mini packs in a dual-core 1GHz processor, a step down from the quad-core Exynos 4 chip found inside international, Australian and Korean versions of the handset.

* It also has a five-megapixel camera on the back versus an eight-megapixel sensor on the Galaxy S III.
* On the networking front, it supports HSPA on the 900/1900/2100MHz bands
* • 4.0-inch WVGA Super AMOLED display • 1 GHz dual-core processor • 121.55 x 63 x 9.85 mm, 111.5g • Android 4.1 Jelly Bean • five-megapixel rear camera with LED flash • front-facing VGA camera • WiFi a/b/g/n, WiFi HT40 • GPS/GLONASS • NFC • Bluetooth 4.0 • 1,500 mAh battery
* Features shared between the two smartphones, among others, include Samsung’s natural language recognition software called S Voice (a Siri knock off), Direct Call to automatically call a person you’re texting by lifting the phone to your ear and wireless media transfer called S Beam, the Buddy Photo Share function to automatically share an image between people pictured in a photo and Smart Stay technology that tracks your eye’s movement to automatically shut down the display when you’re not looking at it.

* It should be noted that S Beam is not a stock Android version and only works between S Beam-enabled device, like the Galaxy S III or Galaxy Note II. Likewise, Buddy Photo Share only works between Galaxy phones.
* Samsung will announce details on pricing and availability in due time.
* May be a good idea to work on that branding, Samsung.
* And stop capitalizing the Galaxy name, for God’s sake.
* So, is the Mini in your view a better choice for folks seeking a compact smartphone than the iPhone 5?
