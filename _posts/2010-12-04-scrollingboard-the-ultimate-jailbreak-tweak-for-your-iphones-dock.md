* ScrollingBoard is a new Cydia tweak that let’s you have scrolling, unlimited icons in your dock and folders, and addons in your dock (like iPod controls). What makes ScrollingBoard so interesting is that not only does it bring a few new features to your jailbroken device, but it also replicates the functions of other popular jailbreak tweaks in the process.
* ScrollingBoard’s main goal is to make your iOS device’s dock as useful as can be. The native arrangement of icons on your home screen’s pages is also available on your dock with ScrollingBoard. The addons and SBSettings integration that ScollingBoard brings to the dock also make this tweak especially worth the $1.50 price tag…

* Several of ScrollingBoard’s key features:
* At a $1.50 price point, I think ScrollingBoard is quite the deal for anyone who would like a little more functionality in their dock. The unlimited, scrollable icon support in iOS folders is also a very nice bonus. If you look at it this way, the combined price of Infinidock and Infinifolders is $3. With ScrollingBoard, you’re getting the functionality of two other tweaks (plus a few others) for half the price.
* Pick up ScollingBoard for $1.50 in the Cydia Store. And if you use SBSettings, get the ScrollingBoard’s SBSettings Dock addon for free as well. Enjoy all that dock-customizable goodness!
* What do you think of ScrollingBoard? Will you be getting it?
