* The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition models are available to order tomorrow ahead of launch this Friday, and there’s a new ad promoting these devices.
* It’s available from Apple’s website but not via its YouTube channel yet so I went ahead and uploaded the 30-second video clip to my personal YouTube for you guys to enjoy.
* The video is embedded right below so give it a quick watch.
* I could be wrong, but this might be the first (PRODUCT)RED ad for iPhone. For those wondering, Apple has donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund since 2006.
* How do you like this Apple commercial?
