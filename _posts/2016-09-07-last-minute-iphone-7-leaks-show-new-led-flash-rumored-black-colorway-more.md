* We have some last minute images of claimed iPhone 7 units leaked by Vietnamese outlet Techsignin ahead of Apple’s iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 event today. A pair of photos provide yet another look at the backside of the iPhone 7, showing a rumored new four-part LED flash, a slightly curved camera design, a waterproof SIM tray and more.
* Of course, the photos also show off that new black colorway that many people seem to be clamoring for. Check out the images and post your thoughts in the comments.
* The image top of post appears to show off a rumored new glossy black colorway as well as that Deep Blue color option that Mac Otakara first mentioned a few months ago. The glossy black finish appears to attract fingerprints easily, but I’m sure you’ll be able to wipe them off given the backside is made from aluminum.
* Apple is also rumored to provide a matte black color option.

* The image above gives us a closer look at the new LED flash system that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said would use four LED lights (two cool, two warm) to improve photos taken in low-light situations.
* And here’s a view of the SIM opening on the side of the device.

* The SIM tray appears to have a rubber seal on the edges to help with waterproofing. KGI also said the iPhone 7 would have IPX7 waterproofing like the Apple Watch, meaning it could survive submersion in one meter of water for thirty minutes.

* I’m not sure about you, but I’m really keen on that glossy back and am ready to ditch my iPhone 6s just for that Darth Vader-like dramatic black finish.
* What do you guys think about these images?
