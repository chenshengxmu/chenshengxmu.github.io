* The Dev Team has recently updated their renowned RedSn0w jailbreak tool to version 0.9.10b5 in order to fix the DRM issue for iBooks on jailbroken devices.
* This fix, which was developed by PlanetBeing and integrated into RedSn0w, overcomes the jailbreak detection by iBooks that would cause some images to not display properly, if at all…
* If you’ve had problems with iBooks, you may want to run RedSn0w on top of your existing jailbreak, making sure you do not select Cydia, should you decide to do that.
* The Dev Team notes on its blog that:
* If auto-detection fails and redsn0w tells you no identifying data was found, you can always pre-select the appropriate 5.0.1 IPSW using “Extras->Select IPSW”.
* If you don’t want to use RedSn0w, Corona should be updated shortly to version 1.0-6 to incorporate this iBooks fix. When it hits Cydia, you can simply install or update the package.
* As always, you can download RedSn0w from our downloads section. For more information about this jailbreak tool, please refer to our dedicated RedSn0w page. Those of you who aren’t sure how to use RedSn0w can also check out our comprehensive RedSn0w guides to:
