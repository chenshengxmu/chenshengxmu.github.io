* Shortly after releasing iOS 8.4 for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad and OS X 10.10.4 for the Mac, Apple refreshed the mobile Beats Music application in the App Store so you can transfer your existing playlists and library over to Apple Music. Release notes accompanying the update make no mention of other changes beyond playlist migration.
* The app is available at no charge in the App Store.
* If you’re a Beats Music subscriber, you can now move your subscription to Apple Music, which transfers all of the playlists you have created on Beats Music, along with your library, over to Apple Music.
* “Apple Music offers many of the great features you already know and love in Beats Music,” release notes read. “Plus, you’ll have unlimited access to over 30 millions songs, including handcrafted playlists and albums curated by the world’s leading music experts, a reimagined live radio station, and a personal connection to the artists you love.”
* The migration assistant gives you iTunes credit for any remaining balance you have on your Beats Music account. Keep in mind that covering your Beats Music account to Apple Music one will permanently cancel your existing Beats Music account.
* As a result, you will lose the ability to stream Beats Music content to supported audio accessories such as Sonos hardware. For what it’s worth, Apple partnered with Sonos to bring support for Apple Music to Sonos equipment later this year.
* The 17.9-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and is optimized for the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen resolutions.
* Download Beats Music free in the App Store.
