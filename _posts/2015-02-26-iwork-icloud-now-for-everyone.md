* Apple today removed the beta tag from its iWork for iCloud productivity suite, which it opened up to non-Apple device owners earlier this month. Now, anyone with a modern browser and an Apple ID can utilize the web-based office apps which include Pages, Numbers and Keynote.
* As seen in the above screenshot, users who don’t have an Apple ID can create one by following the “Create one now” link, regardless of whether or not they own a Mac or iOS device. All that’s required is that they give their name, email address, date of birth and pick security questions.
* Once an ID is created, new users can access Pages, Numbers and Keynote Web apps, as well as the Settings page. Here they can create, edit and manage text documents, spreadsheets and presentations, but note that non-Apple device owners will be restricted to 1GB of online storage space.
* Even with the limitations, it’s not typical of Apple to open up its software to folks outside of its coveted Mac and iOS ecosystem, so this is still a pretty big move. And as TechCrunch notes, it’s a pretty smart one too, as it provides a fairly low-stakes additional incentive for attracting new users.
