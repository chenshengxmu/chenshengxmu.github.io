* The Pangu.io jailbreak seemingly came out of nowhere, but we can confirm that it 100% works. We tested the jailbreak on our device running iOS 7.1.1 and it worked just as advertised, burning two exploits in the process.
* Pangu will eventually come in two flavors—a Windows version and a Mac version—however, the Mac version is still in development. Inside, we’ll show you how to jailbreak iOS 7.1.x on your device using Pangu for Windows. 
* The Pangu jailbreak should work with the following devices: iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPod touch 5th gen, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina Display.
* Step 1: Download the latest version of Pangu from our downloads page
* Step 2: Plug your iOS 7.1.x device in to your computer’s USB port
* Step 3: Run Pangu_v1.0.exe on your Windows machine. If you see weird characters, it may be due to Windows not displaying the Chinese character-set correctly. Simply follow along in our video above to see what we mean.
* Step 4: Make sure the checkbox is unchecked, and click the Start Jailbreak button.
* Step 5: Pangu will ask you to go to Settings > General > Date & Time and disable the Set Automatically toggle. You will then need to set the date to June 2, 2014.
* Step 6: The jailbreak process will start. Eventually you will see the Pangu app icon on the Home screen. Tap the Pangu icon to launch the Pangu app.
* Step 7: Wait patiently, and the jailbreak will process. The video tutorial is sped up, the whole process takes about 10-15 minutes, so be patient.
* Step 8: Once the jailbreak is completed, you should see a “enjoy your new jailbreak message”. Unlock your device, and you should see Cydia on the Home screen.
* Congratulations. You now have an untethered jailbreak on iOS 7.1.x. Pangu should automatically set your date setting in Settings > General > Date & Time back to Set Automatically.
* A Mac version should be out soon, and as soon as it is, we’ll post a Mac tutorial as well.
* Have you tried to jailbreak your iOS 7.1.x device yet? How did you fare? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
* Update: An official version of Pangu has now been released for Mac OS X. We’ve created a walkthrough video and tutorial for jailbreaking iOS 7.1.x on a Mac.
