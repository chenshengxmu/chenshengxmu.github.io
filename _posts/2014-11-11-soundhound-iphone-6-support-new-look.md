* SoundHound’s music-tagging iOS app has received a makeover Tuesday morning putting the software in line with the design aesthetic in iOS 7. New features are available for faster music discovery, with native display support for the new 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus display sizes and other goodies.
* The refreshed interface features swiping based navigation that tucks the Search button and other options under a left-side column revealed by swiping left.
* You can also swipe right like you would in other iOS 7 apps to go back to the previous page and you’ll notice a new nicely animated listening screen as well.
* SoundHound is free in the App Store.
* SoundHound’s home screen has received a substantial makeover.
* The improved layout now combines your search history with top videos, emerging artists and popular music into one scrollable view.
* Sound hound 6.3 changelog
* SoundHound had more than 200 million users as of April 2014.
* If you use Rdio, SoundHound allows you to add tagged songs to your playlist without switching apps.
* The 17-megabyte universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iAd with iOS 7.0 or later.
* SoundHound’s $6.99 ad-free edition with advanced features is also available.
* [App Store]
