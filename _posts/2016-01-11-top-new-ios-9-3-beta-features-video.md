* We’ve put together an in-depth video showcasing many of the new iOS 9.3 beta 1 features. I think it’s safe to say that this release packs in many more features for a minor version release than we’re used to. In this video, we showcase the new Touch ID security option for the Notes app, the new quick action 3D Touch shortcuts, updated News app features, multiple Apple Watch pairing ability, and much more.
