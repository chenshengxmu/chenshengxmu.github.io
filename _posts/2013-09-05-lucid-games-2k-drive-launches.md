* Last month, 2K Games announced a new iOS exclusive racing title called ‘2K Drive.’ The game features a number of real world vehicles, more than 25 tracks, 100+ unique events, and what the developers call “the most precise driving on iOS.”
* Combine all of this with impressive graphics and gameplay, and needless to say the game caught our attention. So we were excited to hear this morning that 2K Drive has been released on the App Store, and is now available for download…

* From the App Store description:
* “Buckle-up and get ready for the most immersive automotive experience to ever hit your iPhone & iPad. 2K Drive provides you with a variety of experiences to test your driving skills – including licensed cars, real locations and dozens of exciting challenges in an authentic world rooted in motoring culture.
* Expert driving will earn you stars and coins to purchase boosts, upgrades, new cars and more! 2K Drive lets you compete online with your friends and the world, to earn the best scores, bragging rights, and rewards ahead of your rivals. “
* And here’s the official launch trailer:
* And a few of the game’s more notable features:
* The good news is, 2K Drive doesn’t follow the recent trend of ‘freemium’ or free-to-play games, so you won’t be constantly bothered with in-app purchases. The bad news is, the game’s upfront price tag comes in a little bit on the higher side at 7 bucks.
* At any rate, if you’d like to checkout 2K Drive, you can find it in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for $6.99.
