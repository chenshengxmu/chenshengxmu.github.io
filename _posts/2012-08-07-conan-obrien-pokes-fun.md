* With billions of dollars hanging in the balance, and both companies’ reputations at stake, the Samsung-Apple trial is one of the most high-profile in history.
* But you wouldn’t know any of this unless you frequently visited tech sites, like iDB, or you happened to be watching tonight’s episode of Conan O’Brien…
* Comedian Conan O’Brien showed the above clip on his talk show tonight, catapulting the Samsung-Apple dispute into mainstream status. And as you can see, it was quite the hit.
* But it’s hard to tell whether the audience knows that the first part of the skit isn’t a joke or not. Apple has been legitimately trying to prove that Samsung copied its smartphone and tablet designs for months now. And has been doing well in court over the past few days.
* At any rate, what did you think of the sketch?
