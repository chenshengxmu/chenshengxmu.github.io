* According to Apple’s dashboard for developers which monitors iOS devices that are accessing the App Store, iOS 8 is now powering 84 percent of active iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices in the wild.
* The most recent data point was measured by the App Store on June 22, 2015 and represents a single percentage point increase over the 83 percent milestone from two weeks ago.
* A month ago, iOS 8 adoption rate stood at 82 percent.
* Seen below: iOS 8 adoption rates two weeks ago.

* As the chart top of post indicates, iOS 7 is now powering fourteen percent of iOS devices in the wild, representing a decreased from the 15 percent mark two weeks ago.
* Pre-iOS 7 versions of Apple’s mobile operating system continue to power two percent of legacy hardware out there.
* As for Android, Google-collected data during a 7-day period ending on June 1, 2015, indicates that Android Lollipop (versions 5.0 and 5.1) now powers 12.4 percent of smartphones and tablets that run Google services and include the Play store app.

* Fragmentation remains a major issue for Android developers as Android Lollipop was introduced more than a year ago. Eleven percent of devices registered by the Play store run Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich or earlier.
* Android 4.1.x Jelly Bean hardware comprises 37.4 percent of Android devices with the Play store. As for Android 4.4 KitKat, that version still powers nearly four out of each ten Android smartphones and tablets out there.

* Again, Google’s numbers exclude devices that run forked Android builds, like Amazon’s Fire-branded smartphones and tablets, as well as tons of low-cost devices sold in China that don’t have the Play Store preloaded and run one of the localized third-party applications stores instead.
