* Search ads on App Store are now available to developers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea, according to a post this past weekend on Apple’s portal for developers.
* This is in addition to the previous expansion last November that saw the Search Ads feature make its debut in Canada, Mexico and Switzerland.
* Announced at the 2016 WWDC in June and launched in October 2016 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, search ads are available across any app category.
* Developers can run ads on App Store to promote their app at the top of customers’ search results. Customers don’t see any ads for the apps they already have downloaded and installed on their iPhone and iPad. Small and independent developers can invest as much or as little time as they have and still get measurable results.

* Apple creates these ads based on a developer’s input and the system matches them to relevant searches. “You can refine who sees your ad with optional keyword, audience and location features, and you only pay when a customer taps on your ad,” notes the Cupertino firm.
* Do Search Ads add any value to the store?
