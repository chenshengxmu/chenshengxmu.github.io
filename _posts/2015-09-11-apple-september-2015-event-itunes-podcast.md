* If you want to relive new iPhone, iPad and Apple TV announcements and watch Apple’s keynote presentation in the comfort of your home, on your own time and without streaming, now you can as the full event video has surfaced as a downloadable high-definition video podcast on iTunes.
* “See Apple CEO Tim Cook and team introduce iPhone 6s & iPhone 6s Plus, the all-new Apple TV with tvOS, iPad Pro, WatchOS 2 and iOS 9,” reads the description. The presentation runs two hours and twenty minutes long so block out about three hours of your time this weekend and enjoy it in its entirety.
* The event video is available in standard (480p), HD (720p) or full HD (1080p) resolution through Apple’s special podcast channels on iTunes dedicated to keynote videos.
* The files are massive—the full-resolution video is nearly eight gigabytes in size— so it’t be wise to ensure you’re downloading them via a broadband Internet connection.
* Here are the download links:
* You can set Apple keynote videos to download automatically to your Mac, iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as soon as they surface on iTunes by subscribing to Apple Keynotes, Apple Keynotes (HD) or Apple Keynotes (1080p) channel on your Mac or iOS device.
* Don’t forget to turn on the automatic download option in podcast settings.
* What’s your favorite product announcement?
* For me, it’s got to be the vastly improved Apple TV set-top box.
* I’ve always been a big fan of the Apple TV even though the experience has been lacking for years. It is therefore that I was watching the keynote talk with great anticipation, especially the unveiling of the new Apple TV with the Siri Remote, downloadable apps and games and what not.
