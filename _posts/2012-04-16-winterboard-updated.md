* WinterBoard. It seems like just mentioning the name of the utility can send shivers down the spine of jailbreakers everywhere. In fact, a lot of folks won’t install a particular app or tweak of it requires installing the unpopular themer.
* So what’s wrong with it? Speed, stability, you name it. WinterBoard has long been a scapegoat for jailbreak-related problems. But the utility may be worth a second look now, as it has just received a major update…
* Saurik pushed out WinterBoard 0.9.3904 today and it features a host of bug fixes including:
* As a minimalist, I don’t typically use WinterBoard. But the utility has been working great for me since I installed it and a handful of compatible tweaks and themes on my iPhone 4S this morning. And the word is it runs a lot better on A4 devices as well.
* At any rate, if you want to revisit WinterBoard, you can find it in Cydia, in the default repo, for free.
* Have you tried the new WinterBoard update? What do you think?
