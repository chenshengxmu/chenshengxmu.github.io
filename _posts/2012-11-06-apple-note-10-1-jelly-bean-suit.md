* Apple’s just expanded its second lawsuit against Samsung, seeking to include the South Korean company’s 10.1-inch Galaxy Note tablet on a list of allegedly infringing products. In addition, the iPhone maker has alleged that Google’s Android version 4.1 software, also known as Jelly Bean, infringes upon its patents. This could be the first time Apple directly sued Android over alleged patent infringement, though it wasn’t immediately clear whether Apple’s complaint involved the entire Android OS or just Samsung’s TouchWiz overlay. The case is scheduled for trial in 2014. And so it continues…
* Bloomberg has the story:
* Apple Inc. told a judge that Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Note 10.1 device infringes its patents, and sought to add the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean operating system to an existing lawsuit against Samsung in California.
* Apple made the arguments today to U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul S. Grewal in federal court in San Jose.
* Apple’s move could be in response to Samsung taking Apple to court last month, contending the iPhone 5 infringed on its patents. The fact that Apple won a $1.05 billion jury verdict against Samsung on August 24 – and is seeking more – also likely didn’t sit well with the Galaxy maker.
* Also in litigation news: Judge Lucy Koh will rule next month to determine whether Samsung should be banned from selling its Galaxy products in the United States.
* This development comes just as we thought an end to this legal mess might be in sight. Remember, just yesterday the search giant re-iterated  it is still “interested in reaching an agreement with Apple” over patents.
* I guess Google could change its mind now, even if it’s not directly involved in this case.
