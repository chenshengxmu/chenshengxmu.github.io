* Apple has named Hipstamatic’s just-released video-capturing app Cinamatic its App of the Week for this week. This means that through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the title for both your iPhone and iPad, for free—a modest savings of $1.
* For those unfamiliar with the app, it essentially does for videos what Hipstamatic does for photos. Users can record short clips, between 3-15 seconds, and turn them into short films. Tools like lighting filters and social sharing are just one tap away…
* From the App Store notes:
* Cinamatic is the best way to create beautiful short films. Record multiple short clips that transform into amazing short motion pictures. Your Cinamatic videos can be shared straight to Instagram, Vine, or Facebook.
* • Shoot 3 to 15 second films • Choose from an amazing set of video filters • Instantly post videos to Instagram, Vine, or Facebook • Get even more filters from the shop
* Upgrade to Cinamatic PRO for even more: – Add a Soundtrack – Advanced Image Controls – Clip Merging – Segment Rearranging 
* And a few more screenshots:

* And finally, a finished video sample:
* Sure, the app won’t change your life, but it could serve as a nice jump-off point for folks looking to get into amateur filmmaking. Plus it’s free. If you’re interested, you can find Cinamatic in the App Store. It’s compatible with the iPhone 4 and later devices.
