* Nobody listens to CDs anymore, am I right? OK, I know that CDs are still the most popular form of physical music. However, if you’ve got 20GB of music right on your iPhone 6s, then you probably don’t have a binder full of CDs in your glove box. Which means you probably don’t use the CD player in your car very often.
* Why not make use of that dusty old CD player by using it to mount your iPhone 6s? Mountek’s nGroove is a universal dashboard mount that fits into the CD player slot. So, it doesn’t get in the way of your air conditioner, it’s not using up valuable cup holder space, and it isn’t in your way when you are trying to see out of your windshield.
* The mount has a thin plastic strip that slides into the CD player slot. Once inside, you can turn the adjustment knob, which expands the width of the plastic strip. After you’ve “opened” the plastic strip, it will be anchored inside the CD player.
* The cradle, which is made out of plastic and has a foam lining, expands to fit most smartphones, including the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Squeeze together the expandable grips to secure your device in place. Press the quick-release button at the bottom to release the grips and remove your device.
* The cradle rotates on a ball joint, so you can adjust your iPhone 6s in a variety of different positions. There is a platform on the bottom of the cradle that you can remove if you need to access your charging port. The platform is there for added security from potential slippage of your device.
* Mountek’s nGroove universal CD slot mount is available on Amazon for $23. It has a four-out-of-five star rating from more than 4,400 reviews.
