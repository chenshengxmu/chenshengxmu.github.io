* If you have an iPhone, iPad or Mac, chances are that you have created an Apple ID account at some point. If you have an iTunes, App Store or iCloud account, then you have an Apple ID. Unfortunately, Apple does not allow you to delete your Apple ID account outright. But we’ve prepared this guide on how to deactivate your Apple ID account so that it is no longer linked to any devices or services… 
* While there is no official way to delete your Apple ID account, here are two solutions that could help:
* The first part involves signing out of your iCloud account on Mac. Keep in mind that your Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, Safari, Photos and more will no longer be synced.
* Step 1: On your Mac, click on the Apple icon in the Menu Bar and open System Preferences.
* Step 2: Click on iCloud.

* You may use your Apple ID in several places, so make sure that you have signed out or deactivated your account for the Apple Store, iBooks, Messages, FaceTime, Game Center and other services too. You can also change the name, address, phone number and other personal information that is associated with your account by signing into the My Apple ID portal.
