* Apple on Wednesday seeded the third beta version of iOS 9.1 to developers. The software is available to registered developers either over-the-air, for those running the latest iOS 9.1 beta, or via Apple’s developer website.
* Today’s release comes one week after beta 2 was made available to developers, and 3 weeks after iOS 9.1 was first introduced to the public during Apple’s iPhone 6s event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.
* For those who haven’t been following the releases, iOS 9.1 brings about a handful of new features such as support for the recently-announced iPad Pro accessories and Unicode 8, which includes a number of new emoji.
* We’re currently installing today’s 9.1 beta, and will let you know if we spot any major changes. If you see something we missed that you feel is worth noting, let us know in the comments below or at tips@idownloadblog.com.
* If you’re not a developer, Apple is offering a public beta of iOS 9.1, which should see a similar beta 3 update as soon as tomorrow. Apple also today released iOS 9.0.2, which features several bug fixes and improvements.
