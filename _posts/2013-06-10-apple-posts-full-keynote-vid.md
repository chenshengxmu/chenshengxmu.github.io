* Folks who missed Apple’s WWDC keynote this morning, or would just like to watch it again, will be happy to hear that Apple has just posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. Obviously, you can read everything you need to know about today’s event right here on iDB. But if you have the time, the video is definitely worth watching…
* Like the iOS 7 introduction video, the keynote doesn’t appear to be available on Apple’s YouTube channel yet, so we can’t embed it here. But for those who would like to watch the clip, you can find it on Apple’s website. Just make sure you have QuickTime installed, or a similar player that supports QT files. Apple loves its QuickTime.
* Personally, I felt like this was one of Apple’s better WWDC keynotes. They showed off impressive new features and changes coming up for Mac OS X, new and upcoming Mac hardware, and sweeping changes to iOS 7. Tim Cook was solid as usual, as was Phil Schiller. And Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of OS X and iOS, was surprisingly impressive.
* What did you think of the keynote?
