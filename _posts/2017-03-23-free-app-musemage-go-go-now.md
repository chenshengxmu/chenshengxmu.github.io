* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app Musemage. For the next 7 days, you’ll be able to grab the photo and video editor for free on both iPhone and iPad—a savings of $4.
* Musemage is jam-packed full of features to open up your mobile device’s camera like no other app can. Those features include various camera lenses, filters and effects, a manual mode and blue screen mode.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Filming and editing is serious business, but Musemage makes it so easy you might be fooled. This all-in-one tool lets you shoot in HDR or manual mode—that means your colors will always be vibrant and you get to choose where you focus. Oh, and adding real-time filters to your video clips? That’s a great way to make your movies pop.
* And here are a few more screenshots:
