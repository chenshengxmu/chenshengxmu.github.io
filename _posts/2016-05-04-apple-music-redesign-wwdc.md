* Since its debut, Apple Music has received its fair share of criticism as fans complained about various issues, from the confusing, complicated user interface to a number of design inconsistencies. Thankfully, your prayers haven’t gone unnoticed by the powers that be at 1 Infinite Loop, California.
* As reported by Bloomberg, Apple is set to show off at WWDC next month a “more intuitive” version of Apple Music that should be easier to use.
* “Apple Inc. is planning sweeping changes to its year-old music streaming service after the first iteration of the product was met with tepid reviews and several executives brought in to revive the company’s music strategy departed,“ reads the article.
* The redesign is headed by Apple’s new content head Robert Kondrk and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, who has a strong influence on the look of the application, while design guru Jony Ive and his team have also provided input along with Jimmy Iovine and Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president in charge of Internet services.
* The overhauled app is said to better integrate streaming and downloads while the radio service should expand. Currently, song downloads are handled through the stock iTunes Store app, while the Music app integrates Apple Music streaming.
* That said, the article claims Apple is still struggling to integrate its Beats employees and unite the streaming and downloading businesses into a cohesive music strategy.
* These changes will be accompanied “by a marketing blitz”. Sources also said that revenues from album and song purchases from the iTunes Store have remained steady at nearly $3.5 billion, even after Apple Music took off.
* It’s been said by sources that a complicated leadership structure and a culture clash within Apple that occurred after the company bought Beats caused internal friction.
* “There were times when they were in the middle of negotiations with an artist’s managers and labels while, unbeknownst to them, Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music’s top executive, was carrying out his own separate discussions, according to people familiar with the matter,” reports Bloomberg.
* For what it’s worth, Apple’s leaders are said to have expressed optimism about the new look and feel of Apple Music and the fact that the service’s 1,000 people strong teams are now working better together.
