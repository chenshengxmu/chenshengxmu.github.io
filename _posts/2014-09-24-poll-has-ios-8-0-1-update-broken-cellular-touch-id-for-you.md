* If you have just updated your trusty iPhone to the just-released iOS 8.0.1, chances are you may have ended up with a device that can’t connect to the cellular network (shows No Service in the status bar) or read fingerprint data through the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. As you could imagine, social media is awash with complaints from disgruntled users who are venting their frustration over the cellular and Touch ID issues.
* At any rate, your best bet is to steer away from this update until Apple address the situation and releases a fix. Not everyone is affected, of course, but keep in mind we have no real indication as to how widespread those issues are because Apple, at the moment, isn’t talking much.
* That’s why we’re asking you, our readers, to tell us whether iOS 8.0.1 has broken cellular connectivity and Touch ID for you.
* This won’t be fixable without an iOS 8.0.2 update, I think, as Apple has already pulled iOS 8.0.1 from its Dev Center. Moreover, the software is no longer available via an over-the-air download.
* ”We are actively investigating these reports,” an Apple spokesperson told Re/code’s John Paczkowski. “In the meantime we have pulled back the iOS 8.0.1 update.”
* Here, cast your vote now.
* Has iOS 8.0.1 update broken Cellular + Touch ID for you?
* By the way, we had to switch from Polar to Wedgies because, you know, Google bought Polar and intends to fold it into Google+.
* If you’re not sure why all the fuss about the iOS 8.0.1 update, here’s what some (many?) people are experiencing after updating to iOS 8.0.1.
* Fortunately, as Apple is signing three firmwares (iOS 8.0.1, iOS 8 and iOS 7.1.2), you can easily downgrade to iOS 8.0 or iOS 7.1.2 and we have a tutorial just for that.
* We’re also tracking reports that people who have performed a clean install of iOS 8.0.1 or did a restore through iTunes are not exhibiting those issues and will report back with more information soon.
* We want to get to the bottom of this issue so share your horror stories about iOS 8.0.1 with fellow readers down in the comments.
