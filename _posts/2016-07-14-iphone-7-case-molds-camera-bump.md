* Following a photograph posted this morning by Italian site Macity.it, which allegedly showed iPhone 7 case molds in Gold, Rose Gold, Space Gray and Silver (but not in the rumored Apple Watch-like Space Black appearance), French blog NowhereElse.fr posted a pair of case mold shots of its own.
* The new photos give us a better look at the camera bulge on the device’s back, which now appears a bit smoother and cleaner due to seamless integration of the camera and the device’s backside.
* The images depict case molds for a 4.7-inch model of the iPhone 7 and appear to be in line with prior rumors. Specifically, the hole for the iPhone 7’s single-camera system is visibly larger than that on the current-generation 4.7-inch iPhone 6s. The rumored dual-lens camera should be exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus model.
* Here’s another image posted by the site.

* A larger opening lets more light in, in turn boosting the quality of photos taken in low-light conditions. You can also see that the camera hardware, along with its metal ring, doesn’t just protrude from the hole on the back like on the iPhone 6/6s series, but is now more seamlessly integrated into the housing.
* Sure, it still sticks out like before so there’ll be no escaping that unsightly camera bulge, but at least it now looks easier on the eyes due to the smooth curvature.
* Feel free to share your observations down in the comments.
