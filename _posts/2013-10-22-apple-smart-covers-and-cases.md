* Although there wasn’t any mention of the rumored Surface-like keyboard cover at today’s iPad event, Apple did announce updates for its current line of cases that will launch alongside the two new tablets.
* Both the iPad Air and new iPad mini with Retina display will get a new set of Smart Covers and Smart Cases. The Covers, again, just cover the screen of the iPad, but the Cases offer wraparound protection…

* Looking first at the new Smart Covers, they’re made of polyurethane and will come in yellow, blue, green, black, pink, and Product (RED). And of course, they’ve been resized to fit the iPad Air’s much slimmer bezels.
* As for the new Smart Cases, they’re made of dyed leather on the outside and have a microfiber interior. And they’ll also come in 6 colors, including brown, beige, black, yellow, blue and red—the same as the iPhone 5s cases.
* What makes the Case so special is that it not only protects the tablet’s display with a magnetic three-paneled cover, but it covers the sides and rear casing of the device as well, without covering up any buttons or ports.
* The Smart Case for the iPad Air and iPad mini will cost $79 and $69 respectively, and are scheduled to launch alongside the new tablets next month. The new Smart Covers have the same availability, but will cost just $39.
