* Feeling a little blue about the Apple TV refresh now that you see it got a nice new interface along with 1080p? Don’t fret, current Apple TV owners will be able to bask in the glory of that new interface as well via a software update later today.
* Of course, if you’re an Apple TV jailbreaker we advise you to hold off on updating if you want to maintain your jailbreak, but we have to admit it will be mighty hard not to give into the curiosity of the new UI update.
* Obviously if you want to enjoy 1080p video, with iTunes in the Cloud support, you will need to preorder a shiny new Apple TV today. It will be available next week for $99.
* What do you think?
