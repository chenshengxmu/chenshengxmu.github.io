* When the weather gets colder, I get grouchier. Even though the crisp autumn air clears the city of pollen and reminds me that the holidays are just around the corner, I still find myself wanting to hide out under a warm blanket for the next four months.
* Weather Or Not is a weather app that connects to your calendar to tell you just how cold (or warm) it will be right during events, so you can plan your winter garb accordingly. No more showing up at picnics without an umbrella. Plus, the iOS 8 extension gives you the forecast at a glance.
* The app will ask for your location and permission to access your calendar. Then, it will give you a report of the current temperature, the high and low forecast, and the chance of rain. When you tap the rain forecast, you can also find out the current wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and cloud coverage.

* A graph at the middle of the screen, which kind of looks like a mountain range, can be dragged to the left or right to show you a minute-by-minute weather prediction, including if it will be clear, cloudy, or raining. As you adjust the time of day, the screen’s color will adjust to the natural lighting. Even sunsets get an orange glow for a short period of time.
* At the very bottom of the screen, you will find the seven-day forecast. Tap a day to see its minute-by-minute weather prediction.
* You can add multiple locations to your list and switch between them by swiping from left to right on the screen. To view your day’s calendar events and the forecast for that time, tap the calendar icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
* You can also schedule a weather alert for specific events. So, if you are planning on heading to the park for a Disc Golf meet up, you can schedule a notification to let you know whether to bring a jacket.

* The iOS 8 Today View Notification Center widget will show you the current weather, the chance of rain, the highs and lows and the humidity. You will also be able to see today’s scheduled events and the predicted weather for that time of day.
* Weather Or Not costs $2.99. Download it in the App Store today.
* What do you think of this helpful weather widget? Will it replace what you use right now?
