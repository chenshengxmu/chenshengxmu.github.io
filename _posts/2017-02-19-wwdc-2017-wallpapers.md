* Every Apple announcement sparks interest from the fanbase. Many armchair analysts try to predict event announcements from the tea leaves found scattered about the event invitations. Regardless of your interpretation of the WWDC 2017 event invitation imagery, the designs always make excellent wallpapers.
* A popular category in the Wallpapers of the Week section, Apple event announcements always prove to be the most visited and downloaded. We are excited to provide downloads for an entire pack of WWDC 2017 wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, and desktop.
* As with all Apple event wallpapers, the following were sent to me via @jim_gresham. Using Twitter to communicate, iDB is able to collect wallpapers as quickly as they are produced. If you have any WWDC event wallpapers or would like to send images in the future, please be sure to connect with me directly.
* The first image is from iDB fan favorite, AR72014, and the following sets were sent to us by Matt Bircher. You can find more of his work via a web gallery.
