* It’s been a while since we’ve seen any cool Siri Proxy videos. At one time they were all the rage, with people starting cars, adjusting thermostats, and more, all via Apple’s virtual assistant.
* Now that the newness of Siri has worn off, Siri hacks and proxy usage has kind of died down. That is, until now. With the help of a friend — the credit card sized Rasberry Pi computer — this guy is able to open up his garage using only his voice.
* Of course, I made it sound a whole lot simpler than it actually is, but anyone can do this with a little patience. To learn more about the project, head over to the Rasberry Pi forums.
* That’s a pretty impressive use of Siri Proxy, don’t you think? Now, if only I could get Siri to make me a sandwich.
