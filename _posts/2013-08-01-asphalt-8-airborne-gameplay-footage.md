* Mid-June, French games maker Gameloft released first screenshots depicting the upcoming eight installment in the Asphalt racing franchise, Asphalt 8: Airborne. The high-quality game is coming to iOS and Android later this summer, priced at just 99 cents.
* Earlier this week, the prolific publisher posted a new teaser trailer, along with a dev diary video from earlier offering a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Asphalt 8, including interesting looking gameplay footage. I’ve included both videos for your viewing pleasure just after the break…
* Here’s the new teaser.
* The game utilizes a brand new physics engine.
* Here’s the original teaser trailer, from last month.
* The dev diary video offers more insight behind the creative process.
* Asphalt 8: Airborne promises synchronous and asynchronous multiplayer, several game modes (Gate Drift, Infected and Takedown), eight brand new maps and a bunch of vehicles (including Lamborghini, Bugatti, Zonda, Ferrari and Mercedes), all spiced up with non-stop high-octane action.

* According to Gameloft:
* Asphalt 8 features 8 all new maps from the Nevada desert to the city streets of London, plus a bonus revamped Monaco track for our A7 fans. What I really love about these new tracks is the impact the environments have on each race.
* Yes, there is snow. And dust. And rain! Hydroplane through the water-soaked streets of Tokyo after a heavy downpour or slip and slid across frozen tracks in Iceland. And each map features a host of alternate routes to explore and conquer.
* According to an App Annie survey, Gameloft was the App Store’s top games publisher in June 2013 and second top publisher by monthly game downloads on Google’s Play store.
* So, what do you think?
* Is this going to be the best Asphalt game yet?
