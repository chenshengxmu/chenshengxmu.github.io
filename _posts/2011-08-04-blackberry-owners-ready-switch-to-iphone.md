* It seems RIM’s BlackBerry user base continues to decline, according to a new research study from Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. Once the most popular smartphone in the United States, BlackBerry is losing market share rapidly, despite introducing several new handsets and its new BlackBerry 7 OS.
* According to the study, out of 216 smartphone users 64 percent of them said their next purchase will be an iPhone, most likely the next-generation iPhone 5. Munster claims that his study also found that 67 percent of BlackBerry owners would switch to an iPhone. 
* 26 percent of current BlackBerry users said that BlackBerry would remain their smartphone of choice. On the other hand, 94 percent of current iPhone owners claim their next smartphone will be a new or next-generation iPhone, while 42% of Android owners said they would be continuing with Google’s Android OS for their next phone.
* What do you think? Are you planning on purchasing an iPhone as your next smartphone, or will you switch over to Android?
