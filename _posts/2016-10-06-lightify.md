* Those of you who use Spotify to stream their favorite music online are probably accustomed to the app’s dark interface, but if you think you might enjoy a lighter app makeover, then you may like a new free jailbreak tweak called Lightify.
* With Lightify, your Spotify app gets a white makeover. It turns everything you know about the app into a lighter experience rather than the darker black and gray UI you’re probably used to.
* Here’s a glance at what Lightify will do to your Spotify app after you install the tweak:

* As you can see, it’s a stark difference from the stock dark UI, which we’re showing you below for comparative reasons:

* The tweak will add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can easily toggle the tweak’s effects on or off on demand:

* This is great if you want to use the dark interface at night for less eye strain while you listen to your favorite tracks and use the light interface during the day for ease of viewing.
* Whether or not you’re going to like the lighter UI in Spotify comes down to a matter of opinion. Some people like it when all their apps look uniform and use the same colors (white in this case), while others like the way Spotify stands out with the sexy dark UI.
* If you’re interested in trying Lightify, you can download it on your jailbroken iPhone today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. If you’re not already a Spotify user, and want to try it, you can download the app for free from the App Store today.
