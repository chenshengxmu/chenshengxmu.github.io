* Semi-untethered jailbreaks like H3lix, Yalu102, Phœnix, and LiberIOS put an app icon on the Home screen so you can boot into a jailbroken state after your device restarts, but that’s really the only time you’ll ever use these apps.
* Whenever you’re in a jailbroken state already, these apps seem pointless to have on the Home screen. That said, a new free jailbreak tweak called Hid3x by iOS developer ipad_kid can hide these apps whenever you’re in a jailbroken state, as shown above.
* The tweak essentially prevents these apps from appearing on your Home screen indefinitely, but it only works when you’re in a jailbroken state because it depends on Cydia Substrate.
* As soon as you reboot your device into a non-jailbroken state, Cydia Substrate stops functioning and so does Hid3x. In this event, the icon conveniently reappears, letting you boot back into a jailbroken state without any fuss.
* In short, Hid3x won’t prevent you from getting back into a jailbroken state if you needed to, so installing it is entirely safe.
* Minimalists and neat-freaks that keep their Home screen looking spiffy at all times should enjoy Hid3x because it hides unwanted clutter when it isn’t needed. Furthermore, it’s a cleaner way to deal with the situation than merely tucking the app away in a folder.
* Then again, not everyone has the desire to hide these apps away, so it really comes down to personal preference and how you use your device.
* If you’d like to give Hid3x a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t come with any options to configure, and it works on all versions of iOS with a semi-untethered jailbreak.
* Do you like seeing your semi-untethered jailbreak app on your Home screen at all times or do you enjoy having it hidden when it isn’t needed? Let us know in the comments section below.
