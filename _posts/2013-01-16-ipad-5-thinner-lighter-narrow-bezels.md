* Apple’s next full-size tablet, the iPad 5, will borrow some design elements of the smaller 7.9-inch iPad mini, one analyst forecasts Wednesday. Among the most noticeable changes: the iPad will be both thinner and lighter than the iPad 4, released in October 2012.
* Additionally, the Apple watcher expects the tablet maker to unveil an enhanced iPad mini with Retina display matching the resolution of the full-size tablet.
* Unlike most observers, this particular analyst thinks that the new 9.7-inch iPad may appear late this year rather than during the current quarter…
* In a note to investors, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities, said the upcoming iPad 5, a fifth revision to the original 9.7-inch iPad tablet, will be “significantly lighter and slimmer” than previous versions.
* The new full-size tablet also will include a narrower screen border, requiring a refined multitouch software to prevent accidental screen touches occurring from your thumb resting on the side bezels when scrolling or interacting with the device using the other hand.
* Remember, the 7.9-inch iPad mini was first to introduce iOS multi-touch enhancements to solve the user experience problems stemming from the skinnier side bezels.
* Going against most predictions that Apple will unveil its updated full-size iPad in March, Kuo expects a third-quarter announcement, reports AppleInsider.
* While his prediction would break Apple’s usual twice-a-year upgrade schedule, the analyst has correctly forecast past product release dates. In 2012, he forecast the iPad 4 would be unveiled before the end of the year, timing that departed from Apple’s expected launch date. However, the company did announce its latest full-size iPad in October.
* One product the analyst isn’t expecting this year is an Apple-branded HDTV.
* Although a number of Wall Street observers believe the company may introduce a TV this year, Kuo forecasts the Apple TV box will be updated during this quarter, with an Apple TV appearing no sooner than 2014.
