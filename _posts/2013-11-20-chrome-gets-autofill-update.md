* In line with its announcement last week, Google has updated its Chrome browser for iOS this afternoon, bringing the app to version 31.0.1650.18. The update includes several bug fixes, and a couple of handy new features.
* The headlining new feature is called synced autofill, and it will auto-complete forms on the web that you’ve previously filled out while logged in under the same Google account. And there’s also a new long-press function…
* Here’s the 31.0.1650.18 change log:
* Fast form completion with Autofill  Tired of filling out web forms with the same information time and time again? The Autofill feature lets you complete forms with just a few clicks. Sign in to sync this data from your computer to your iPhone or iPad and save even more typing. Long press on an image to search for related images – Stability / security improvements and bug fixes
* Back in October, marketing research firm Chitika issued a report with data showing that Chrome’s total share of iOS web traffic in the US and Canada has doubled since it launched last year, going from 1.5% to around 3%.
* For me, this update is perfect because I use Chrome as the main browser on my Mac and iOS devices. Google is just better at syncing device data over-the-web than Apple is, and I’m sure synced autofill will reiterate that.
* You can download the latest version of Chrome, for both the iPhone and iPad, from the App Store for free.
