* Released in January 2014, Sega’s Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has delighted fans of Mario Kart-style racers with a World Tour mode designed specifically for mobile and its awesome multiplayer implementation supporting up to four players simultaneously, both locally and online.
* The official iOS port of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for consoles, the game debuted with a price tag of five bucks and has since seen several price changes in an effort to boost downloads.
* As Sega continues to experiment with various monetization methods, they’ve now taken the freemium route by slashing Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed to zero bucks and throwing in a bunch of paid in-app upgrades…
* You can race as Sonic or any of the legendary All-Stars characters, speeding across land, sea and air in your transformable vehicle that can change from car to boat to plane mid-race.

* Check out the launch trailer below.
* Plus, the April 29 update will add new characters like Metal Sonic and Wreck-It-Ralph, as well as new tracks and modes such as World Tour Chapter and Boss Cup Grand Prix.
* Download Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed free in the App Store.
* The massive 1.05GB download is universal (supports both the iPhone and iPad natively), requires iOS 7.0 or later and, again, contains optional in-app purchases.
