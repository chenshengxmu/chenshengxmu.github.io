* Twitter’s new live-streaming Apple TV app arrives just in time for NFL Thursday Night Football. Available at no charge in the tvOS App Store, it lets owners of the fourth-generation Apple TV stream both top Twitter/Vine videos and the 10 NFL games that the micro-blogging services recently acquired the rights to broadcast, plus content from Bloomberg News, Campus Insiders, Cheddar, MLB Advanced Media, NBA, Pac 12 Networks and other premium sources.
* And exclusively on the Apple TV, viewers can enjoy live premium video and check out tweeted video clips through a seamless side-by-side video experience. The app does not require you to have a pay TV subscription or a Twitter account to enjoy these high-definition video streams.
* To get the app, search for “Twitter for Apple TV” in the tvOS App Store on your fourth-generation Apple TV. The app is available globally in the tvOS App Store and in select markets on Amazon’s Fire TV HDMI dongle and Microsoft’s Xbox One console.
