* Right after Google announced its fascinating research into neural networks and highly advanced image processing with so-called “deep dream“ code, developer Realmac Software immediately set out to make an app out of it.
* The Internet giant did open-source the code, but you must have the technical chops in order  to make use of it because setting up a server to process images for yourself isn’t really a trivial endeavor for average people.
* Launching today as a public beta, Deep Dreamer for Mac simplifies the process of processing your own photos with Google’s deep dream algorithm, and the results are both fantastic and eerily disturbing.
* “We’ve brought together an easy-to-use yet unbelievably powerful Mac app that allows you to make your own deep dream images,” Realmac co-founder Dan Counsell tells me via email.
* Deep Dreamer lets you process ordinary photos to create beautiful images or terrifying nightmare visions, the choice is yours.

* The app packs in the vast range of options to soup up your images, but the good news doesn’t stop here as Realmac has taken Google’s processing engine to a new level by adding support for GIF and movie export.
* Process video can often reveal the shapes and objects hiding within it. You can also process a still photo and tell Deep Dreamer to generate an animated GIF of the process as it interprets your image.

* “Give Deep Dreamer a photo and watch as horizons get filled with towers and pagodas,” Realmac explaisn. “Rocks and trees turn into buildings. Birds, dogs, and insects (aka puppy slugs) start to appear from out of nowhere.”

* Features include:
* Depending on the settings you choose, deep dreams can take awhile to process. Realms recommends processing smaller images, usually under 1.5 megabytes, while testing out the app. Of course, if you plan on creating animated GIFs or movies with Deep Dreamer, you’ll need to be patient as rendering your clips will take some time.
* Two more deep dream examples follow.

* Download the public beta of Deep Dreamer from Realmac Software.
* A full license can be purchased for $14.99 during the beta period. When the app exits beta, a license will increase to $24.99.
