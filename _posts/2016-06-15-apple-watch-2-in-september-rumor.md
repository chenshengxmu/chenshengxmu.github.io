* A second-generation Apple Watch will most likely launch either alongside Apple’s iPhone 7 this September or later this year, according to supply chain sources who spoke with DigiTimes, a Taiwanese trade publication with a hit-and-miss record in reporting Apple rumors.
* Apple is said to have stepped up procurement of chips and other components for the Apple Watch 2. Orders for the upcoming device have reportedly been higher than expected, with an estimated two million monthly shipments of the second-generation Apple Watch.
* Noting that sales of the Apple Watch thus far “have been a disappointment,” the sources opined that the “rather aggressive” Apple Watch 2 orders are hinting that Apple’s commitment to the product remains strong.
* Shipments of chips and components for the Apple Watch 2 are set to begin in the third quarter of this year, with the device expected to debut “later in 2016,” probably this fall alongside the iPhone 7.
