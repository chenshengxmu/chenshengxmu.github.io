* Apple last midnight started accepting pre-orders for both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
* The handset is scheduled to start shipping to customers next Friday, a week from today, September 19.
* Already reports are coming in that the 5.5-inch model is in short supply (as expected), with all iPhone 6 models said to be selling out across Germany and United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the sought-after device remains in high demand.
* Unfortunately, accessibility and transactional issues with the Online Apple Store are persisting and spoiling the fun for some people: chances are you, too, had to jump through hoops before reserving yours. With that in mind, we’d want to learn which iPhone model, colorway and storage SKU ended up in your shopping basket.
* So, which iPhone 6 did you buy?
* We would like to kindly ask the people who haven’t pre-ordered the device, or have not managed to place their order yet, to refrain from voting — the aim of this poll is to give us an insight into which iPhone 6 models might be selling best during the opening weekend.
* First, tell us whether you bought a 4.7 iPhone 6 or 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.
* Next, which color did you choose?
* And finally, what storage capacity did you opt for?
* If yesterday’s poll asking you about pre-ordering or buying an iPhone 6 in-store is an indication, approximately two out of each three respondents (or about 66 percent) pre-ordered their device from the comfort of their home.
* After having thought long and hard about it, I’m definitely going to be picking up a 128GB iPhone 6 Plus in Space Gray. Why Space Gray? Because it’s the only color option with a black front plate.
* Just take a look at this beauty and tell me it doesn’t look sleek.

* From my vantage point, it looks stunning, especially coupled with the curved edges of the display and the rounded, subtly subdued aluminum enclosure giving the design that unmistakably smoked Apple look which harkens back to the days of the original iPhone, wouldn’t you agree?
* Folks who haven’t had a chance to place their order yet should check out Sebastien’s survival guide to pre-ordering the iPhone 6.
* By the way, we’re going to have to find ourselves another polling solution because Polar (the system we rely on for polls on the site) just announced getting acquired by Google.
* Their iOS app has already been pulled from the App Store as a result of the Google deal and the team cautioned about keeping the publisher tools alive “until the end of 2014”. The Polar team has moved to Google’s Mountain View headquarters to help improve Google+.

* That’s it, please share this poll with your friends and feel free to send us your poll suggestions to tips@iDownloadBlog.com.
* And of course, do explain your math down in the comments.
