* Hermès is a Paris-based fashion label specializing in leather, lifestyle accessories, perfumery and luxury goods. The company is “dedicated to serving European noblemen” though its products are renowned around the world.

* The collection is available in multiple colors and three different styles: Single Tour, Double Tour and Cuff. The $1,100 Single Tour buckle design includes the 42 mm stainless steel Apple Watch and the band in Fauvre and Noir colors. The 38-millimeter model is available in Fauve, Noir and Capucine leather bands.
* The Cuff edition sports a much larger leather band and is only available in Fauve color. The flagship Double Tour comes in the 38-millimeter size and with a leather band that wraps around the wrist twice, available in Fauve, Etain, Capucine and Bleu Jean colors.
* In North America, the Apple Watch Hermès collection is only available in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Toronto. At its ‘Hey Siri’ event, the Cupertino firm launched new Apple Watch bands and all-new gold and rose gold anodized models for the Apple Watch Sport.

* In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Apple’s Chief Design Officer, Jony Ive, described the Hermès partnership as “something highly unusual for Apple to do—to talk about an unannounced project.”
* “I’ve been at Apple 23 years and this is conspicuous and singular. I’ve never known anything like this,” he said.
* Pierre-Alexis Dumas, creative director for Hermès, said the Apple Watch partnership gives the 178-year-old brand the chance to prove it can be contemporary.
* “We are a new tradition and an age-old tradition, and we meet at the center of the arch.”
