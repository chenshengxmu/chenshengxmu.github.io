* Spotify on Monday told The Telegraph that it now has more than 100 million monthly active users worldwide. But of that 100 million, only roughly 30 million or so are paid subscribers—so the ones that dole out ~$10 a month.
* For comparison, SVP Eddy Cue announced during last week’s WWDC keynote that Apple Music now has 15 million paid subscribers. Now that’s just half of Spotify’s count, but still very impressive for a service less than 1 year old.
* Spotify has confirmed that it has more than 100m monthly active users on its music streaming service today. Based on its last count, the Swedish company is adding 1.8m users to the service monthly, and 30pc of users are paying subscribers. 
* The news comes as Spotify overtakes Skype as the most highly valued European startup, worth roughly $8.5bn, according to tech investment bank GP Bullhound. 
* Spotify, which launched in 2008 and came to the United States in 2011, is the world’s most popular streaming service, but increased competition from Apple and Google, and rumors of Amazon joining the fray, threaten its dominance.
