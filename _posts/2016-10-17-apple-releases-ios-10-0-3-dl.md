* Apple on Monday released a new update for iOS labeled version number 10.0.3. The update appears to be exclusive for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and it can be downloaded via the Update mechanism in Settings, or from our Downloads page.
* As noted in the screenshot above, 10.0.3 brings about various bug fixes, including one for an issue where users could temporarily lose cellular connectivity. This has been a fairly high profile iPhone 7 bug, particularly among Verizon users.
* Today’s update arrives amid ongoing beta testing of iOS 10.1, which is expected to be released within the next few weeks. It includes a new feature exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus, called Portrait mode, that gives photos a depth-of-field effect.
