* As teased yesterday, the new streaming music startup from music mogul Jimmy Lovine and musician and producer Dr. Dre, called Beats Music, has been updated with support for the iPad. The 17.1MB download is now live in the App Store and universal so a single binary now supports all your form-factor iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. As a bonus, regardless of the device you can now easily add Beats Music users from your Twitter friends…
* This is what’s new in Beats Music 2.0:
* ● A stylish and sophisticated interface designed specifically for the iPad’s larger screen ● All your favorite features including Just for You, the Sentence, Find It, My Library and Offline Mode ● Dedicated support for both landscape and portrait modes ● In-app subscription and account management via your iTunes account
* Oh, and on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad the app now has a new Find Your Friends feature that adds the ability to find and follow your Twitter friends on Beats Music.

* Download Beats Music 2.0 in the App Store free of charge.
* The app requires iOS 6.0 or later.
* You’ll also need a paid plan, available as a monthly $9.99 In-App Subscription, meaning Apple is getting its customary 30 percent cut on all subscriptions signed up within the app.
* There’s also a $14.99 family plan for up to five users. If you’re an AT&T subscriber, you can try out this plan free of charge for 90 days provided you have an active device on your AT&T account.
