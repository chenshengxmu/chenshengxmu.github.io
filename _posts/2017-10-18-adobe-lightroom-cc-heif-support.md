* This is pretty significant.
* As you know, Apple’s new space-saving image format introduced in iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, dubbed High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), is pretty great.
* However, we’re living in a JPEG world in which the vast majority of popular image editing and photography apps are currently incompatible with HEIF, holding back its adoption.
* I’m pleased to report that Adobe’s begun to roll out support for HEIF-encoded images (.HEIC files) in two of its key photography-related apps: Lightroom CC and Adobe Camera RAW.
* Adobe’s various Photoshop-branded mobile apps for iPhone and iPad did not receive HEIF support at the time of this writing. However, it’s probably a question of “when”, not “if”, more so considering Lightroom now supports HEIF images in your photography workflow.
* No matter how you look at it, Adobe rolling out HEIF support in both its popular photography app Lightroom and the equally important Adobe Camera Raw app is huge.

* It’s only a matter of time before mobile and desktop Photoshop apps (along with other productivity software from Adobe) fully adopt Apple’s new image format.
* HEIF support is currently non-existent in Windows.
* “HEVC and HEIF files are only supported by Apple devices,” according to a Microsoft employee. “As of now, there are no apps or programs that run on Windows 10 that can support HEVC codecs and HEIF files.”

* Microsoft is probably evaluating bringing HEIF support to Windows 10. And with Adobe beginning to adopt HEIF, I don’t see how Microsoft can ignore the new format for much longer.
* Although Microsoft and Adobe are big players, I think mass adoption of the HEIF format will be determined by browser vendors. If future version of Chrome and Firefox bring support for HEIF, the format will take off in a big way. HEIF images are half size of their JPEG counterparts, meaning webpages that use them will load faster and consume less bandwidth.
* It will take some time but we’ll get there eventually, I’m sure.
* Thoughts on HEIF?
