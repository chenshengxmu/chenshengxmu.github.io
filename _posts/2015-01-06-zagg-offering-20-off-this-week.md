* Folks who picked up a new smartphone or tablet over the holidays, or are just in the market for some new accessories, will want to visit ZAGG’s online store this week. From now through January 9th, the manufacturer is offering 20% off of everything sitewide.
* ZAGG makes a wide variety of products for both iOS and Android devices, including headphones, cases and of course the InvisibleShield screen protectors. It also has a line of highly regarded tablet keyboards, which will see significant discounts during this promo.
* To get your 20% off, use the promo code: 20OFFSITE at the checkout screen.
* It’s worth noting that in testing the above links, I received a popup alert on ZAGG ‘s website offering an additional 10% off, for a total discount of 30%. Also keep in mind that supplies are limited, so if you want something, don’t hesitate to press the buy button.
* Again, the sale ends January 9th.
