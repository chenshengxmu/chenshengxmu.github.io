* Do I have any HomeKit accessories in my home? No, not yet, but that’s because I currently live in a rented apartment. I’ll be getting smart home gadgets when I buy my own house, that’s for sure. Until that day arrives, I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed for prices of HomeKit products to continue dropping.
* Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of how HomeKit brings these appliances together in the Home app with support for scenes, Siri voice control, remote management via Apple TV and other perks. I also like it a lot how HomeKit products are required to use hardware encryption for security purposes. It’s just that outfitting my home with these smart gadgets would represent too sizable an investment for my budget, that’s all.
* So, what about you? Do you own any HomeKit-certified accessories? Cast your vote and meet us in comments if you’d like to share your thoughts about the HomeKit platform or any HomeKit devices you already own, or may be planning on buying.
* With HomeKit, you set up your iPhone to configure, communicate with and control compatible smart home appliances. Using iOS 10’s Home app, you can group devices and enable automatic actions through Siri.
* As always, Apple is committed to enhancing and protecting your privacy so HomeKit vendors are required to purchase a license and use a special encryption co-processor in their products to prevent sensitive data about users and their homes from being compromised and hijacked wirelessly.
* So, do you have any HomeKit smart applicants in your home?
* Please vote now.
* Do you own any HomeKit products?
* If you happen to own Apple’s latest fourth-generation Apple TV, you don’t even need to purchase a dedicated HomeKit hub—that’s because the set-top box already doubles as a HomeKit hub for remote control of your smart home appliances.
* Have you taken a closer look at some of the 100+ HomeKit-compliant devices that have launched since Apple debuted the HomeKit platform more than two years ago?
* If so, which ones do you like the most, and why?
