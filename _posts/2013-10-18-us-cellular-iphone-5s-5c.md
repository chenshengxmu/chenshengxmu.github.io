* When T-Mobile became an official Apple partner earlier this year, US Cellular became the largest carrier in the United States to not offer the iPhone. But it looks like that’s all going to change next month.
* After turning down the popular handset in 2011, the company confirmed in May of this year that the iPhone was coming. And today, it announced that it will get the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c on November 8th…
* The iPhone 5s and 5c launched on Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile on September 20th, and has been rolling out to smaller carriers ever since. So US Cellular’s November 8th launch is over a month behind.
* But the good news, for subscribers at least, is that it’s coming. Unfortunately, though, that’s about all we really know right now. We’ll be sure to update this post with more information as it becomes available.
