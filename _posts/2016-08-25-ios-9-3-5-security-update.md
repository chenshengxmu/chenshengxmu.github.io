* Apple on Thursday released iOS 9.3.5 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It’s a relatively small download, weighing just 40MB, and the release notes only say that it features an “important security update.” You can install the new software via the Settings app on your iOS device, or grab it from our Download section.
* Today’s update arrives 3 weeks after Apple rolled out iOS 9.3.4, which notoriously patched the latest Pangu jailbreak. Obviously, folks currently jailbroken, or those still on iOS 9.3.3 with hopes of jailbreaking should also stay away from 9.3.5, as Apple stopped signing 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 earlier this week.
* Here are the full release notes from Apple’s Support page:
* Kernel
* Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later
* Impact: An application may be able to disclose kernel memory
* Description: A validation issue was addressed through improved input sanitization.
* CVE-2016-4655: Citizen Lab and Lookout 
* Kernel
* Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later

* Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution
* Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling.
* CVE-2016-4657: Citizen Lab and Lookout
* These are serious bugs, and it turns out they were being used in phone-tracking malware. Read more about the vulnerabilities here.
