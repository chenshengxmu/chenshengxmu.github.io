* Apple’s new iPhone X has made TIME’s annual unranked list of the 25 best products of the year 2017, joining other inventions like guilt-free ice cream, Nintendo Switch and fidget spinner.
* The publication commented on Thursday that iPhone X is to Dan Riccio, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, quite literally a dream come true.
* “I look at the design as something we really wanted to do since day one,” he said.
* To make an iPhone with an edge-to-edge OLED display, a monster chip optimized for augmented reality and a sophisticated camera system which lets users unlock the phone with their face, Apple had to kill the Home button and introduce additional gestures.
* That decision was driven by “looking to the future,” Apple’s design tzar Jonathan Ive said in a separate interview with TIME. “I actually think the path of holding onto features that have been effective, whatever the cost, is a path that leads to failure,” he said.
* “We have a clear vision” for the next generation of iPhones, Ive said, adding that the first-ever OLED phone from Apple is “in some sense a completion of a chapter.”
* Other products that made TIME’s list include the Halo Top low-calorie ice cream, the Jibo robot, 3D-printed Adidas shoes, a heated mug that keeps coffee warm, a multi-directional elevator, Tesla’s Model 3, DJI’s Spark drone and—yes—fidget spinner!
