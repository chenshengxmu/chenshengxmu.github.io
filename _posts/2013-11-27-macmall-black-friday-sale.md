* Continuing on with our Black Friday coverage this week, popular online retailer MacMall has kicked off its big holiday sales event today. The deals, which will be good through midnight on November 29, include significant discounts on Macs, iPads and more.
* Among the discounted products is the all-new iPad Air. MacMall is offering various deals on Apple’s latest tablet, starting at $41 off for the 16GB Wi-Fi model all the way up to $70 off the 128GB. And it’s taking $102 off all MacBook Airs and 13″ MacBook Pros…
* Here are some of MacMall’s better Black Friday offerings. Also note that the retailer sells older-model Mac computers and iOS devices as well, and tends to discount those more heavily than its newer products. Just click the link to jump right to the product page.
* Keep in mind that other outlets are hosting Black Friday sales as well, and could be offering better deals. Best Buy, for example, is taking $200 off the 13-inch MacBook Pro and $200 off its 21.4″ iMac. Check out our Black Friday Deals Roundup for more info.
