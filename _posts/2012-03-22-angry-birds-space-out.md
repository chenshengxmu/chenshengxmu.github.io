* We told you recently that those Angry Birds were going to make their way into space, and today Rovio released the new game for iOS gamers.
* Angry Birds Space is pretty much what you would expect: Angry birds trying to finish those pesky pigs off, but with a distinctly starry flavour.
* Available for both the iPhone/iPod touch and the iPad, Angry Birds Space takes to the skies, with planets and their own gravitational pull adding something very different to the tried and tested Angry Birds formula that has already made Rovio’s games extremely popular across a range of devices. From what we’ve seen, this space-flavored version will be just as popular…
* “After a giant claw kidnaps their eggs, the Angry Birds chase it into a wormhole and find themselves floating in a strange new galaxy – surrounded by space pigs! Luckily the Angry Birds have super powers of their own.”
* Gamers will be treated to 60 levels, with the usual additions set to come by the way of updates moving forward. New birds and their new superpowers are also on the agenda, giving gamers something even more unique than the plethora of Angry Birds games they have already been playing.
* Angry Birds Space will set gamers back $0.99 on the iPhone and iPod touch, while Angry Birds Space HD is available for $2.99. Both versions are in the App Store right now!
* Have you been enjoying some anti-grav-powered bird flinging?
