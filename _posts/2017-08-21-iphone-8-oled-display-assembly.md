* Following our first iPhone 8 component leak in the form of a purported inductive wireless charging printed circuit board last week, more alleged parts for the handset were photographed and posted on Sunday to the Chinese microblogging service Weibo.
* Reposted by leak aggregator SlashLeaks, the images claim to depict an OLED display assembly for the device along with internal components such as a Lightning connector part and flex cables for transferring power to other components. As expected, and previously reported, the display assembly features a notch at the top for the front-facing camera and sensors.
* Benjamin Geskin has posted additional photos depicting alleged OLED display parts, providing a nice side-by-side size comparison between an iPhone 8 OLED panel and an iPhone 7.

* By using an edge-to-edge display design with minimal bezels and removing the top and bottom chin, Apple is said to have packed a 5.8-inch OLED display in a device roughly the size of current 4.7-inch iPhone models.
* With an iPhone 8 announcement now just a few weeks away, weâ€™re likely to see more leaks.
