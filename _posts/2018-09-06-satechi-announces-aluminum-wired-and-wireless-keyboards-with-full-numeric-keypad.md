* On Thursday, Satechi introduced all-new aluminum wired and wireless keyboards designed for iMac computers and other devices. Each features enhanced scissor-switch keys with an extended keyboard layout.
* Available in multiple colors, including silver, space gray, gold, and rose gold, the keyboards offer intuitive macOS function hotkeys. With these, you can pause/play media, switch applications, adjust brightness, and more. With the wireless version, you can connect up to three Bluetooth devices. To switch between typing on a tablet, smartphone, or desktop computer, you simply push the Bluetooth button assigned to the specific device.
* The wireless keyboard also features a built-in USB-C rechargeable port for long-lasting battery life of up to 80 hours between charges.

* For the wired solution, Satechi offers a USB-A cable. Once the keyboard is plugged into your macOS device for the first time, you’ll see on-screen instructions in the “Keyboard Set Up Assistant” window to get started.
* Priced at $79.99 and $59.99, respectively, the Satechi Aluminum Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard and Aluminum USB Wired Keyboard are available for pre-order through Satechi.net and Amazon.com.
* These keyboards begin shipping before the end of September.
