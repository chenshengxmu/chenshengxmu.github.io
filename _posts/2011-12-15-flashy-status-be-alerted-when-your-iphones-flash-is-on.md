title: Flashy Status- Be Alerted When Your iPhones Flash is On

* The concept of Flashy Status is a good one: make it more evident when your flash might fire when snapping a photo with your iPhone’s camera.
* It accomplishes this by illuminating the ‘On’ button on the Camera app’s flash settings with green. You can either make it a solid green, or a more visible flashing green.
* And while I suppose this is nice to have, there’s one key feature missing from this tweak that keeps it from being really useful…
* The problem with Flashy Status is that it lacks an indicator for auto flash mode. You see, when your flash is on, you know it’s going to fire when you take a picture.
* When the flash is set to auto, there’s a chance that it might fire, and there’s a chance that it might not. That’s the area where I think Flashy Status would be more useful. If it could indicate to us when the flash will fire in auto mode, it would be infinitely more useful.
* There are a couple of more options included with Flashy Status that could make the $0.99 asking price worth it for you. There’s a setting to set the default flash behavior, and a setting to disable auto flash mode outright.
* While Flashy Status has some opportunities for improvement, you may deem it useful if you take a lot of photos with the iPhone’s camera app.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
