* If you’re looking to get more out of the battery indicator on your jailbroken iPhone X, then we’d recommend checking out a new jailbreak tweak dubbed Bazzi by iOS developer NeinZedd9.
* Unlike the traditional battery level indicator in the iPhone X’s notched Status Bar, Bazzi aims to provide users with more information at a glance by displaying the battery level percentage within the battery level indicator itself. This ultimately lets you avoid having to open Control Center to see the numeric percentage.
* The concept might sound familiar because of a recent release called PercentageBatteryX, but don’t be fooled; Bazzi has significantly more to offer than the latter.
* Not only does it come with four unique themes to pick from, but it also incorporates two different notch-based battery indicators that follow the curves of the iPhone X’s OLED display, as shown above.
* Bazzi adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the look and feel of the tweak:

* Here, you can tinker with the following options:
* The developer includes a Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane for saving your changes. You’re advised to use it any time you adjust the settings to ensure they take effect.
* In what might be one of the most exciting new jailbreak tweak releases for the iPhone X handset to date, Bazzi promises to improve upon a feature that Apple seriously fell short on. Personally, I think it does a great job, and you might too.
* Bazzi is available from the Hashbang Productions repository in Cydia for $1.99. Because this isn’t a default repository, you’ll need to add it to Cydia yourself by following the steps below:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you can find, purchase, and install Bazzi on your jailbroken iPhone X by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
* Please note that Bazzi only works on iPhone X handsets; it’s not meant to be installed on any other iPhone.
