title: 'PrivateSMS' Hides Your SMS Messages From Prying Eyes
---
* PrivateSMS is a new TweakWeek jailbreak tweak for the iPhone that sets out to hide your personal SMS messages from view.
* The only issue is that if the person who’s trying to read your SMS messages really wants to read them, it’s not too hard to figure out how to do so.
* PrivateSMS makes it so that it appears that you have no SMS messages in your inbox, but with just a couple of taps, all of your messages are instantly viewable.
* This fact alone eliminates PrivateSMS from candidacy when it comes to genuinely securing your SMS messages, but it might be the first line of defense that you’ve been looking for…
* As you can probably tell, this tweak isn’t going to win any awards for its security; there aren’t any passcodes or anything of that nature to lock people out of your Messages app.
* On the other hand, if you’re just trying to protect your messages from your 3 year old, this may be the tweak that’s up for that challenge.
* PrivateSMS is available on Ryan Petrich’s repo as of now (http://rpetri.ch/repo/), but should be arriving on the default Cydia repos in the very near future.
* As always you will need a jailbroken iPhone in order to use this tweak.
* What do you think? Is PrivateSMS a worthy TweakWeek tweak?
