* In addition to treating developers to new betas of iOS 10, tvOS 10 and watchOS 3, the Cupertino company this morning also released a minor software update for Apple Watch owners. The watchOS 2.2.2 software update, a minor bug-fix release, is now available for download through the Watch companion app on an iPhone and includes more than a dozen bug fixes.
* Upon launching the companion Watch app on your iPhone and head to My Watch → General → Software Update to download and install the update on your wearable device.
* The update includes fixes for more than a dozen issues identified in watchOS 2, some of which could allow an attacker to execute malicious code under specific circumstances.
* For detailed information about the security content of this update, see this support doc.
* Keep in mind that your Apple Watch must be connected to its magnetic charging puck, have at least 50 percent battery and be in Bluetooth range to apply the software update.
