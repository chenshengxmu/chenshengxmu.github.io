* The stock App Switcher serves as a way to force quit applications when you need to, but the interface has so much untapped potential to offer more features to the end user.
* Since iOS developer ijapija00 noticed there was room for improvement, he created a jailbreak tweak called DragMeDown (iOS 10).
* This tweak lets you access new functions from the App Switcher by swiping up or down on your app or Home screen cards in the App Switcher.
* You can configure the tweak from the new preferences pane in the Settings app, which is broken down into two major sections: Configuration and Actions.

* The first section deals with customizing the look and feel of your App Switcher, giving you ways to choose what options are allowed to appear in the DragMeDown menu, while the second section lets you configure the swipe up and down gestures for your app and Home screen cards:

* You can configure direct actions for the app and Home screen card swipes separately, which gives you a grand total of four different gestures you can use:
* To many of those very same gestures, you can assign a number of different actions, including:
* Please note that not all of these options are available for all four gestures.
* With all of the new gestures and options DragMeDown (iOS 10) brings to the table, you can do a lot more in your App Switcher than just force quit apps like you would on a stock device, which gives you a noticeable amount of new ways to control your device.
* If you’re interested in trying DragMeDown (iOS 10), you can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is initially a free download, but you will have to purchase it for $1.99 from the preferences pane after installation. DragMeDown works on all jailbroken iOS 10 iPhones and iPads.
