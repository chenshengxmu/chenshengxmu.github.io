* TweetDeck for Mac, the popular Twitter-owned desktop client, on Wednesday received its first significant update since August 2014.
* Available free of charge, the refreshed application now displays native Twitter video and animated GIF files inline and allows you to exchange direct messages with multiple users in group conversations, in addition to half a dozen other improvements.
* The new TweetDeck 3.9.482 for Mac also brings support for multi-image uploads: now you can attach up to four images to a single tweet, like in Twitter’s official mobile client for iOS.
* Next, it’s now possible to share a tweet via Direct Message to a group of friends. The app now supports TweetDeck Teams and Dataminr subscribers can now add columns and receive notifications of new alerts to Dataminr watch lists.
* TweetDeck Teams is a simple solution to Twitter account sharing which lets you delegate access to as many people as you like and remove accounts when they no longer need access.
* TweetDeck 3.9.482 changelog:
* As a reminder, TweetDeck users on the web, Chrome and Windows are required to use Twitter logins to sign in to TweetDeck by March 31, 2015, with the Mac edition to follow soon.
* The 3.8-megabyte app requires an Intel-based Mac with a 64-bit processor and OS X 10.6 or later.
* Download TweetDeck free in the Mac App Store.
