* iOS 11 is still a bit away from its public release this fall, but as we approach that deadline, betas are now starting to roll out closer and closer to one another.
* iOS beta 6 has just been released and it is full of small tweaks and optimizations.
* In our short time with it, it’s clear that everything is starting to look much more polished than it has been in weeks past, as evidenced by our hands-on video walkthrough embedded below.
* The biggest visual changes here in beta 6 include revamped icons for App Store and Apple Maps (now featuring the new Apple Park headquarters) along with a fixed Reminders icon with bullet points back on the left instead of the right.
* There is also a nice animation for AirPods that you can see when opening the case near your phone. To see that animation, and everything else new, check out the full video below.
