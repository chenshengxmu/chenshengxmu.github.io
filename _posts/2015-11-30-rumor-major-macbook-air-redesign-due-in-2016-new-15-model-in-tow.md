* Apple’s MacBook Air notebook is rumored to receive a thorough redesign next year alongside a brand new fifteen-inch model introduction, according to a report Monday by Economic Daily News.
* The thinner, faster machine is thought to be up for an official introduction at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in the summer of 2016.
* If true, it will mark the first major facelift of Apple’s MacBook Air notebook since its debut eight years ago.
* Billed as a comprehensive upgrade, the updated MacBook Air is said to feature fully redesigned components such as the metal chassis, battery modules, panels, cooling modules and more.
* With the fifteen-inch model possibly added to the existing lineup of 11.6 and 13.3-inch models, the average selling price of MacBook Airs is expected to rise. The machine is currently in the design stage, the report adds.
* The report claims that the new lineup will come in 13-inch and 15-inch variations but it’s possible that these will be Retina-enabled models while Apple might choose to keep the current non-Retina 11.6-inch model on the market as an entry-level option.
* On the other hand, it’s entirely conceivable that the 11.6-incher will be a goner considering the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and twelve-inch MacBook already occupy that space.
