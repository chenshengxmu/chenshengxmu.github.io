* Better Switcher Position is a simple jailbreak tweak that switches the position of the rotation lock button and the music button found in the app switcher. The idea behind the tweaks is that it more closely aligns the volume control slider found in the app switcher, with the music button.
* While the position of the app switcher buttons never really dawned on me before, I guess the developer of Better Switcher Position has a point. Take a look at our hands-on video inside to see what I mean.
* At the end of the day, I’m sure that no scientific study was conducted to see if, indeed, this alternate switcher position makes for a better experience, but the only way to find out is to try it for yourself. If you want to give it a go then you can download it free of charge from Cydia’s ModMyi repo.
* What do you think? Is the Better Switcher Position truly, better?
