* I’ve reviewed tons of DreamBoard themes over the last 6 months, and I’ve stumbled upon some really spectacular work.
* Themes such as Asymmetric HD and AppleWeb HD set high bars for what to expect out of the DreamBoard framework.
* As good as those themes are, nothing could prepare me for the meticulously detailed OS X Lion Ultimatum, which is far and away the best iPhone theme I’ve ever seen or used…
* If you’ve ever wanted to run OS X on your iPhone, this is as close as you’ll ever get. The detail on this theme is second to none; obsessive, even.
* Everything from the folders, to the menu bars work as expected. There’s even a subsidized Mission Control baked in for good measure.

* To pull off this amazing feat, the developer orchestrated a collection of other tweaks to do things like hide the status bar, and add a custom lock screen. It’s possible that this could be a turnoff for some, but if you want the full effect of the theme, it’s a compromise I recommend making.
* As of now, OS X Lion Ultimatum is still in the beta phase, but you can snatch up the pre-release version for $3.50. Check out the ModMyi forums for more details on how to get the theme for yourself.
