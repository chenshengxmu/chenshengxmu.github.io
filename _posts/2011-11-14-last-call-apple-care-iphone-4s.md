* Last month we reported on Apple’s latest iteration of its extended warranty service, AppleCare+. The plan differs from previous versions of AppleCare because not only does it extend your device’s warranty, but it also adds low-cost coverage for accidental damage.
* According to Gizmodo, if you pre-ordered your iPhone 4S or 8GB iPhone 4, today is your last chance to grab AppleCare+ for your new handset. The news comes from the AppleCare+ website, which claims that November 14th is the deadline for customers that pre-ordered…
* For those not familiar with the new service plan, AppleCare+ carries a price tag of $99 and extends your iPhone’s warranty. Typically, the smartphone comes with 90 days of telephone support, and a one year warranty. AppleCare+ extends both services to two years.
* Where the plan really shines is its coverage of accidental damage. AppleCare+ owners are covered for two instances of damage due to handling errors: drops, bumps, etc. Each incident will cost you a $49 service fee, but that’s minimal compared to an iPhone’s full retail price.
* Keep in mind that AppleCare+ is typically only available at the time of a new handset purchase. But due to the fact that it’s relatively new, Apple seems to be cutting new iPhone owners a break. If you’re interested, visit Apple’s website for more details on how to add the service.
* Did you purchase AppleCare+ for your new iPhone?
