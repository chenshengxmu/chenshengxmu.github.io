* After posting images of a purported iPhone 7 case with holes for a pair of speaker grilles and dual cameras on the back, gadget leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer today posted on Twitter images of a claimed iPad Air 3 case.
* Corroborating the notion that Apple’s third-generation iPad Air is basically a smaller, 9.7-inch iPad Pro with the same A9X processor, Smart Connector and a four-speaker setup like the iPad Pro, the images show off openings in the right places for quad speakers and the Smart Connector.
* As you can see for yourself, hole placement suggests that the iPad Air 3 will indeed have four speakers and the Smart Connector to connect to a yet-to-be-released, smaller version of the Smart Keyboard for the iPad Air 3. There’s also a tiny hole on the back next to the camera hole, presumably for a LED flash.
* Check out the images and tell us what you think in the comment section.

* The next iPad Air is said to support the Apple Pencil, too.

* Apple is expected to announce a March media event in coming days.
* The rumor-mill thinks the event will serve as a launchpad for the iPad Air 3, a new four-inch phone dubbed ‘iPhone SE’, new bands for the Apple Watch and possibly even a brand new Thunderbolt Display with an ultra-high resolution screen.
