* An update Monday to SoundCloud’s free of charge iPhone and iPad application has added an Apple Watch component allowing you to listen to user-submitted music and audio right from your wrist, identify songs playing from your iPhone and more.
* “The new app makes it even easier for you to hear the freshest tracks when you’re out and about, from your daily to commute to going out for a run,” Germand developers noted.
* Like many other third-party Apple Watch applications, SoundCloud for Apple Watch puts only the most essential features on your wrist, leaving the rest to your iPhone or iPad.
* One of the more interesting features of the Apple Watch component is the ability to identify a song playing in SoundCloud on your iPhone. Just swipe up to bring up a SoundCloud Glance and the ‘Now Playing’ screen will show you a track’s title, artist and artwork.
* The Apple Watch app let you swipe left and right to go back and forwards through your SoundCloud content, tap to start or stop a track and force-tap to add a track to your Collection.
* SoundCloud recently revamped its iPad application.
* Both SoundCloud for iPhone and iPad now lack the previously available audio recording feature, meaning you can no longer upload your sounds and music to the service via iOS, although that feature is still available in the web interface or through dedicated apps such as Retronyms’ free AudioCopy.
* SoundCloud for iOS app lets you create playlists, consolidate your likes and playlists in one location, access a user’s profile from a track or playlist by clicking on their name, discover and hear fresh new indie music and sounds, share your favorite audio with friends and followers, log in to build your Collection and more.
* The 26.3-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and now supports the Apple Watch.
* Grab SoundCloud free in the App Store.
