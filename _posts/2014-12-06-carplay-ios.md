* Eager to see how the CarPlay interface looks on your iOS device? If so, you can use a new jailbreak tweak to preview the look of the CarPlay interface right on your iPhone or iPad.
* CarPlay iOS is a new jailbreak tweak, available free on the BigBoss repo, that makes the CarPlay head unit interface accessible without the need of an external display.
* After installing CarPlay iOS, there are no options or settings to configure. You’ll see a new standalone CarPlay iOS app on the Home screen. Launch the app to open the CarPlay interface right on your iOS device.
* As of now, the interface is fairly lacking. It does feature the large, easy to tap buttons, which is a hallmark of the CarPlay interface, but outside of the Music app and the Now Playing app, there’s not much else to be found.

* You can interact with the two available apps simply by tapping on them. You can use the virtual Home button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen to go back to the CarPlay interface’s Home screen.
* You’ll also notice that the app is in French, which isn’t really a big deal, as it’s just a demo of the Music app. I found the app to be very buggy, crashing when trying to launch any of the tabs in the Music app. I was able to get some music to play, but it was limited to just a song or two.
* Despite this app’s shortcomings, one must remember that this is nothing more than a proof of concept tech demo. It bodes well for the future of CarPlay interface tweaks, and it works very much like I expected something like this to work this early in the game.

* And remember, Adam Bell, a very well-respected developer, is working on his own version of the CarPlay interface for jailbroken iOS devices. This may end up being a great alternative for those who would rather mount an iPad or an iPhone in the car and avoid shelling out hard-earned money for a CarPlay compatible head unit.
* What do you think about CarPlay iOS? Of course it’s rudimentary, but can you see the potential behind the concept?
