* Shigeru Miyamoto, the world-renowned Japanese video game designer, producer and creator of the Mario Bros series, announced on stage at Apple’s event today that the Mario Bros series is coming to iOS devices exclusively in the form of a new game, called Super Mario Run. It’s got a one-handed mode with tap-based controls letting you jump, change Mario’s direction and so forth.
* The goal is simple: collect as many coins as you can and proceed to the next level.
* There’s also a new battle mode, called Toad Rally, allowing you to beat other players’ high scores. Of course, coins you collect throughout the game can be used to advance and upgrade your environment.
* The best thing about Super Marion Run is that they’re planning on releasing the game at a set price, no In-App Purchases whatsoever. Plus, they’ve prepared a set of downloadable Super Mario stickers for iOS 10’s Messages app that will hit the App Store when iOS 10 releases for public consumption.
* We’ll have more on this game when it launches on the App Store in time for the holidays.
