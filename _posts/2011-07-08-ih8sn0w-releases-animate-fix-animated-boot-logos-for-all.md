* Jailbreaking your iDevice gives you the ability to customize it from head to toe. You can change the complete look and feel of the device by editing icons and installing extensions. Another area you can personalize through jailbreaking is the boot screen.
* The default boot logo is of course the infamous Apple logo, but with a little tweaking you can change it to virtually whatever you want. In some of the more recent jailbreaks though, the ability to customize the boot logo was compromised…
* But if you’ve jailbroken recently on any iOS 4.0+ firmware and aren’t able to add animated boot logos from Cydia, iH8sn0w has your back. The 16 year old iDevice hacker has made good on his recent tweets that he’d soon be publishing a fix for the known issue.
* Animate Fix adds a tab in your Settings app labeled BootLogo, which most of you have seen before. Here, you can preview and select custom boot logos that you have downloaded from Cydia.
* If you need help finding a cool animated boot logo, make sure to check out Alex’s top 10 custom boot logos list. You can even show off your love for jailbreaking with your very own iDB logo.
* Though I don’t restart my iPhone very often, it’s kind of cool to mix things up a bit. If you are on iOS 4.0+ and want to give Animate Fix a shot, just do a search for it in Cydia and install.
* Have you tried Animate Fix yet? What boot logo do you use?
