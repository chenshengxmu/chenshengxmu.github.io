* Set the timer, focus on the job at hand, and take a short break when time is up. This helps you stay focused on what you need to do for a certain amount of time and take that necessary break without forgetting.
* Check out these awesome free focus timers for Mac you can snag on the Mac App Store.
* Here are a couple of the things we looked for when creating this list of focus timers for Mac.
