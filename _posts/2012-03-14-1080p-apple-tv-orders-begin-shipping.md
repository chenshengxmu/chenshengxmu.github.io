* If you pre-ordered the 1080p Apple TV that Apple introduced a week ago, you’ll be happy to hear that the set-top box has begun shipping. Many customers have gotten the confirmation email from Apple, saying the third-generation Apple TV is on its way to their doorstep.
* Apple has told customers that the 1080p Apple TV will arrive on Friday, however, according to FedEx’s systems it says the new Apple TV will land at customer’s doorsteps a day early, as noted by AppleInsider…

* The third-generation Apple TV is a slight upgrade from its prodeccesor, featuring the ability to stream 1080p video. The 1080p Apple TV features a custom single-core A5 processor, presumably manufactured by Samsung — but we’ll have to wait for tear downs to get confirmation.
* Customers that pre-ordered early will be the only ones getting the new Apple TV Thursday (or Friday). However, you could get lucky by grabbing one in-store Friday at 8am. The new Apple TV’s shipping time has been slipping over the last week for customers who haven’t ordered yet.
* Did you pre-order the 1080p Apple TV? Has it shipped yet?
