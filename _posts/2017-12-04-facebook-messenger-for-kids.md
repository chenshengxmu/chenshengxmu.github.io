* Facebook on Monday announced it’s releasing a preview of a brand new children-focused Messenger app in the United States which parents can remotely monitor and manage using a set of appropriately designed parental controls.
* The new US-only Messenger Kids app is compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) and ad-free, meaning your child’s information isn’t used for ads.
* Everything about it was designed to be safe for kids, from Facebook-sanctioned GIFs, frames, and stickers to masks and drawing tools. Kids can send photos, videos or text messages to friends and adult relatives, who will receive them via the regular Messenger app.

* “Messenger Kids is full of features for kids to connect with the people they love,” notes Facebook. “Once their account is set up by a parent, kids can start a one-on-one or group video chat with parent-approved contacts. The home screen shows them at a glance who they are approved to talk to and when those contacts are online.”
* With built-in parental controls, parents can easily adjust the features of the app.
* Specifically, parents control kids accounts and contacts to ensure their children cannot connect with people their parent doesn’t approve. Sexual predators rely on apps like Messenger and the relative anonymity provided by the Internet to exploit children so Facebook is attempting to help address this problem with the new app.
