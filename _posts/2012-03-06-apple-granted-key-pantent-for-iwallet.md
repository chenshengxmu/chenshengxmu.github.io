* Many Android device manufacturers have opted to include near field communication (NFC) technology inside of their devices. NFC allows customers to transmit data between two devices. The biggest use for NFC is for mobile payments – which Google has been actively pursuing with its Google Wallet technology.
* Apple has been granted a new patent for the ‘iWallet’ from the United States Trademark & Patent Office, as outlined by Patently Apple. The new patent allows for Apple to include NFC technology into the iPhone for mobile payments…

* The technology would allow credit card companies to charge money to users’ iTunes accounts. This would rule out the need for cash or plastic credit cards while shopping. Users will be able to swipe their iPhones against sensors placed out by credit card companies, to make payments easier.
* NFC payment hasn’t exactly become mainstream as of yet and many are looking to Apple to bring it into more hands. Currently, Google Wallet is only available on two devices.
* The iPhone including NFC technology has been in the rumor mill for quite a while. Apple has been awarded many patents around it, but today’s seems to be the most robust.
* Apple has already begun making its move to mobile payments inside its retail stores. Customers are able to skip the cash register by paying for smaller products with the Apple Store app. Purchases are charged directly to users’ iTunes accounts and actually works very well.
* Personally, I would love for NFC to be rolled out onto the iPhone. Perhaps we will see it on the iPhone 5.
* What do you think of making payments with your iPhone?
