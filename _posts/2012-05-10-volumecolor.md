* You can safely file this one under the “not necessarily useful, but nonetheless interesting” tweak of the day. VolumeColor is a recent Cydia release that allows you to alter the color of your volume HUD.
* It’s also not that original, as I’m pretty sure I’ve seen such functionality in another tweak before, though its name currently escapes me.
* Anyhow, feel free to take a look at our video walkthrough of VolumeColor inside…
* When I initially reviewed VolumeColor, it had two basic settings: a kill switch, and a list of a little under a dozen colors to choose from. It also has an issue where it would not properly display the pink color.
* That pink color issue seems to have been resolved with the latest version of VolumeColor, and the developer has added a few more options to the package for good measure.
* There are now options to both enable a random color, and adjust the opacity of the volume HUD as well.
* VolumeColor is anything but a groundbreaking tweak, but it’s nice to be able to customize your iPhone’s look in this manner. If you’re interested, it can be had for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Let me know what you think about VolumeColor in the comments below.
