* My daily productivity depends on a powerful and flexible personal information management system and Flexibits’ Fantastical for iPhone has quickly become an indispensable part of that workflow.
* I use this versatile app to save reminders for upcoming stories and industry events, create calendar entries for meetings and daily schedules, organize my weekly/monthly planning and lots more.
* It’s fast, has powerful search, looks business and lets me safely paste passages of text knowing its intelligent natural-language processing will automatically parse entries like ‘conference call with Seb next Monday at 1PM PT’ to create related events.
* My only gripe with Fantastical stems not from the app itself, but from the iPhone’s four-inch screen as I often find myself squinting rows and columns of small text.
* I guess you could say that until Apple delivers a rumored large-screened iPhone, I’ll be left yearning for the Fantastical experience on the iPad’s 9.7-inch screen. But not for long, it seems. Tuesday, developers posted a new page teasing the upcoming edition of Fantastical for iPad…
* The page doesn’t reveal much as Flexibits cleverly blurred out the actual user interface, but at least we now know that the software will be ready for prime time soonish enough.
* “Fantastical 2 for iPhone on your iPad is good,” reads the teaser. “Fantastical 2 for iPad on your iPad is even better.”
* You can register your interest and sign up to get notified by email when Fantastical for iPad arrives. According to this tweet, the app will be a separate download so Fantastical for iPhone users will need to pay extra to enjoy the app on their tablet.
* Hey, developers need to be paid for their hard work!
* …and just so there aren’t any surprises, Fantastical 2 for iPad will be a separate app when it’s released.

* The team wouldn’t provide ETA.
* Past updates have advanced Fantastical for iPhone by adding new features such as WhatsApp and 1Password integration, support for the iOS 7 Bold Text setting, enhanced geofencing and badge options and more.

* In the meantime, you can buy Fantastical for iPhone in the App Store for $4.99 and check out for yourself why all the fuss about this nicely done to-do/calendar application.
* It requires iOS 7.0+ and integrates with iOS’s calendar and reminders database.
* Fantastical for Mac is a $19.99 value.
