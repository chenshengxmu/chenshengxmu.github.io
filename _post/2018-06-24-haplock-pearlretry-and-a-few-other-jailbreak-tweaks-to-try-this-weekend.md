* There have been unrivaled amounts of excitement throughout the jailbreak community this week in response to all the hubbub surrounding the Electra Team’s progress on bringing iOS 11.3.1 support to the Electra jailbreak tool. And that’s great for tweak developers.
* So with that in mind, we’ll be talking about all the best jailbreak tweaks released this week in this roundup. As usual, we’ll kick things off by talking about our favorites and then outline the rest of them afterward.

* If you, like many other iPhone X users, wish that your handset would automatically try another facial recognition scan after a failed attempt, then you might like a new jailbreak tweak called PearlRetry.
* This tweak eliminates the steps you’d normally need to take to retry a Face ID unlock attempt. Moreover, you can configure a custom delay for how long after a failed unlock attempt that your iPhone X will attempt to recognize your face again.
* You can learn more about PearlRetry and why it’s a great add-on for jailbroken iPhone X handsets in our full review.
* CardboardButtonAll: Enables the cardboard button in YouTube for all videos (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* HapLock: Provides an ounce of haptic feedback whenever you unlock your iPhone (free via Packix repository – review)
* TweetNightandDay: Brings a host of configuration options to the official Twitter app (free via Packix repository)
* YPlayInGroundTMusic: Enables backgrounded media playback in the YouTube Music app (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* That wraps things up for this week’s jailbreak tweak roundup, but remember to stay tuned to iDB throughout the week to stay updated on new releases as they materialize.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup in case you might’ve missed anything. We also have several dedicated roundups to help you find ways to tweak your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
