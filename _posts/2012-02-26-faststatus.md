title: FastStatus lets you tweet, text, and email using Activator

* With everything going the route of iOS 5’s Notification Center, we’re seeing less and less tweaks that use Activator as a means for invoking, but FastStatus bucks that trend.
* In fact, FastStatus’ ability to retain full compatibility with iOS 4 is one of the feathers in its cap.
* This is a tweak that allows you to send email, text messages, and tweets from anywhere using a user assigned Activator action.
* Check out our video walkthrough of FastStatus in action inside…
* Once installed, head to the settings panel for FastStatus, which allows you to setup your method of activation — as usual I select a double tap of the status bar as my action of choice.
* Hence, in my case at least, double tapping the status bar causes the FastStatus menu to appear. On it are quick links to compose a new SMS message, new email, or open the official Twitter app.
* What I initially viewed as a downside — the fact that FastStatus is hardcoded to use the official Twitter app instead of the built in Twitter functions of iOS 5 — I quickly realized was not so much of a downside for users of older firmware.
* The fact that FastStatus interacts directly with the Twitter app means that it retains full compatibility for iOS 4 users. Bummer for those who are on iOS 5, but overall, a decent compromise for those who still haven’t made the jump for whatever reason.
* FastStatus is a free download on Cydia’s ModMyi repo, and as stated, you will need the official Twitter app installed for it to work with Twitter.
* What do you think?
