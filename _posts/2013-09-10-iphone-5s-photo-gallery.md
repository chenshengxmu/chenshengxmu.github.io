* As expected, Apple unveiled two new smartphones today. The first was the plastic iPhone 5c, and the second the iPhone 5s. And if you’ve been paying attention to the rumor mill over the past several months, there shouldn’t have been any surprises.
* The 5c comes in various bright colors, and is equipped with hardware comparable to that of the iPhone 5. And the 5s of course looks very similar to its predecessor, but it includes a faster processor, better camera and a built-in fingerprint sensor.
* You have to admit that even though it sports the same design as last year, and new features were kept to a minimum, the iPhone 5s is still a very impressive handset–both from a design and performance standpoint. Here, take a look at this gallery…
* The three iPhone 5s color options: Silver, Space Gray and Gold
