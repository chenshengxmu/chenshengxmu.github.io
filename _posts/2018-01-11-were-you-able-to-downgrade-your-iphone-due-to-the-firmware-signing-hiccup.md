* Earlier today, Apple accidentally started signing older firmware versions of iOS, effectively letting people downgrade their devices at will. This was just a temporary hiccup as merely an hour later, Apple closed the signing of all these older iOS versions again.
* Yet some readers have been able to downgrade their devices, and we would like to hear your stories.
* Were you able to downgrade your iPhone or iPad?
* If so, to what version of iOS did you downgrade to, and what are your intentions going forward?
* Please share your experience with the rest of us by leaving a comment below.
