* Twitter’s Vine, an iOS app that lets you impulse-share short five-second clips, may be struggling to take off, but that’s not stopping the popular micro-blogging service from issuing regular updates that add more functionality. One of my main gripes with Vine is its inability to use a front-facing camera.
* That omission right there kills some potentially interesting self-portrait videos. No more, as Twitter today issued Vine version 1.1 which adds support for your iPhone’s front-facing camera…
* Vine engineer Kristian Bauer wrote in a blog post Tuesday that shooting video with a front-facing camera requires tapping the button in the bottom-left when creating a post
* “You can switch back and forth between the regular and front-facing camera as many times as you want,” he notes.
* Another nice-to-have: @user mentions.
* This allows you to tag people in your posts, which is particularly important for clips that want to go viral.
* Mentioning a user is a simple matter of typing his or her @username and selecting the name among the suggestions that pop up. If you’ve ever used mentions in a Twitter app, you’ll feel right at home.
* People who get mentioned in your posts will receive a notification in their Activity tab. When you tag someone, that person’s Vine profile gets automatically linked to your post’s caption.
* Also new in Vine 1.1 is improved people search and fixes for various crashes and minor bugs.
* Vine is vailable free on the App Store for your iPhone and iPod touch. We’re still holding out breath for an iPad edition of the software.
