* PaperLock, like Unfold, and Unlockize before it, adds another “slide to unlock” modification to your iPhone’s Lock screen. PaperLock — as its name not so subtly implies — is a tweak that lends a paper-like “page turning” look to your iPhone, similar to what you see when you turn a page in iBooks.
* Out of the box, PaperLock comes with three high quality themes: paper, plastic, and bandage. It should be noted that the graphics where designed by renowned iOS theme designer Surenix; hence, when I say high quality, you can believe it. How does it match up with other Lock screen mods? Check inside for the details.
* PaperLock looks and performs beautifully, the graphic design and animation properties are absolutely top-notch. Sadly, there are only three themes included in the package, but as noted each theme is of a very high quality.
* The main problem with PaperLock is the price. At $2.99, it’s more expensive than both Unfold, and Unlockize, and when compared to Unlockize, it’s fairly bare bones. My suggestion is that you take a look at all three videos, and see how they stack up for you personally. If I had to choose between the three, it would be Unlockize, which gives you a perfect balance of features and price. Of course, that can all change with a few updates, so keep in mind future expandability as well.
* Head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo if you’re interested in trying PaperLock, and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
