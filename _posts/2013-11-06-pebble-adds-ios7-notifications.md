* Big news today for current and potential Pebble users. The company announced a major update to its smartwatch platform that includes support for all notifications in iOS 7, as well as a new SDK and new APIs for developers.
* Previously, the Pebble was very limited on the types of push notifications you could receive from your iPhone. But now, thanks to updates made in iOS 7, it will be able to receive alerts from Facebook, Google Maps—you name it…
* From Pebble’s announcement:
* “First, we’re introducing a more delightful user experience for Pebble customers using iOS. Pebble is now fully integrated with iOS 7 and works seamlessly with Notification Center. This means that any notifications you’ve enabled in Notification Center on your iOS 7 device will appear on your Pebble — just like that. It’s easier than ever to pick and choose which updates you want to see on your watch. This includes notifications beyond calls, texts and emails, such as Calendar, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Flickr, Dropbox, WhatsApp, Flipboard and more. A new Pebble app for iOS will enable this functionality and is under review by Apple. Expect an update in the iTunes Store soon.”
* And here’s a video of notifications in action:
* Additionally, Pebble announced SDK 2.0 with 4 new APIs: Javascript, Accelerometer, Data Logging and Persistent Storage. And it says it’s working with parters like iControl, Foursquare, GoPro and Yelp to add even more features.
* The Pebble team has seen quite a bit of success since it collected over $10 million in Kickstarter funds last year. It’s now in Best Buy and AT&T retail stores and it’s on the verge of crossing the important 200,000 sales milestone.
* If you haven’t picked up a Pebble yet, all five colors are in stock at getpebble.com for $150.
