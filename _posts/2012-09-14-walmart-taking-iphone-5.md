* Good news for folks who couldn’t get their iPhone 5 pre-order to go through this morning, or don’t want to wait two weeks for it to ship. It looks like Walmart will be offering another round of pre-orders today.
* According to a new report, the retail giant will start accepting in-store pre-orders for the handset at 8 a.m. local time…
* Bloomberg reports:
* “The iPhone 5, announced yesterday, can be ordered tomorrow at 8 a.m. at U.S. stores, Sarah Spencer, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, said in an interview. The newest version of the best-selling smartphone will sell for $189.97 with a two-year contract, Spencer said. That’s cheaper than the $199 price announced by Apple, which will also begin taking orders tomorrow.”
* The iPhone 5 will go on sale in retail stores on September 21, and it sounds like you’ll have plenty of choices. Apple Stores (duh), carrier locations, Walmart and Radio Shack have all confirmed they’ll have the handset.
* Did you place a pre-order through Walmart? We’d love to hear about your experience in the comments.
