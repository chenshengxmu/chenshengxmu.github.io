* If you’re a small band looking to get some attention, what better idea than releasing a music video featuring some of the most popular games for iPhone?
* Australian band Hey Geronimo understands that shooting a video featuring some of our favorite games, namely Plants vs. Zombies, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Flight Control, and Fruit Ninja, is always a sure hit with iOS geeks like us, especially when you bring those games to life…
* The music is actually pretty good, too! If you like it, you can get it from iTunes here.
* What do you think?
