* Pangu released an English version of its iOS 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak tool on Friday, which gets the same job done as the Chinese jailbreak tool that was released over the weekend.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to jailbreak your iOS 9.3.3 device with Pangu on Linux, Mac, and Windows with the new tool.
* Since the tool is now in English, that means more people can read what the tool is trying to say, which helps to not only better diagnose error messages, but also to make sure that you’re clicking on the right buttons.
* Just like the Chinese version of the tool, the English Pangu jailbreak works with all 64-bit iOS devices. Those include:
* To jailbreak with the English version of Pangu, follow these steps:
* 1) Download the IPA file and Cydia Impactor from our downloads page.
* 2) Connect the device you want to jailbreak to your computer via an MFI-certified Lightning to USB cable, then make sure to disable your passcode and disable Find My iPhone on the device itself.
* 3) Next, open the Cydia Impactor file you downloaded. If you are on a Mac, you will be asked to drag the app to your Applications folder, so do that:

* Note: We recommend using a burner Apple ID, so you should probably make a new Apple ID for this process. On the other hand, regular Apple IDs will provide you with a certificate that lasts 7 days, while developer Apple IDs will provide you with a certificate that lasts 1 year. You will have to repeat this jailbreak process every time the certificate expires.
* 8) Next, enter your Apple ID password, and click on the blue OK button once again:

* 10) Once it’s finished, you should see the Start button all over again on the Cydia Impactor app. At this point, you’re done with this app and can close it.
