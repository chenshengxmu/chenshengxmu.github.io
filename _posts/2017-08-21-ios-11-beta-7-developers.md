* Apple on Monday seeded seventh betas of iOS 11, macOS High Sierra 10.13, watchOS 4 and tvOS 11 to developers.
* The matching sixth betas of iOS 11, macOS High Sierra and tvOS 11—which contain the same features as developer-only beta 7 releases—are available to public beta testers, too.
* The newest betas of Apple’s software platforms come just a week after beta 6 landed, as the company gears up for public launches later this fall.
* If you’re a registered developer with a device already running a previous iOS 11 beta, you can upgrade to the latest build over the air using the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app.
* We’re installing iOS 11 beta 7 (build number 15A5362a) software on our devices to hunt for new features, but in the meantime you can check out our video of beta 6 changes:

* Similarly, macOS High Sierra beta 7 (build number 17A352a) can be downloaded over the air through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. If you aren’t already running a High Sierra beta, you can grab the full installer from Apple’s Dev Center. Check out our video of 100+ new features in macOS High Sierra.
* Registered developers with an Apple Watch already running a previous beta version of watchOS 4 can upgrade to watchOS 4 beta 7 (build number 15R5365a) over the air using the Software Update mechanism in the Settings app.
* Developers with the appropriate configuration profile on their Apple TV (4th gen) can install tvOS 11 beta 7 (build number 15J5369a) by visiting Settings > System > Software update.
* Otherwise, it requires you to hook up your Apple TV to your Mac via a USB-C cable and a quick trip to the Dev Center. tvOS 11 is expected to be a modest update, with just a handful of user-facing improvements.
* And that should just about cover it. We’ll update this post (or create a new one, if warranted) with any major changes found in today’s betas. If you see something notable you think we’ve missed, feel free to tell us about it in the comments below, or on Twitter @iDownloadBlog.
