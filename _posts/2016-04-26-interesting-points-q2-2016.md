* Apple announced the financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2016 this afternoon, and the numbers are pretty rough. While they fall within the company’s own guidance, iPhone sales are down 10 million units from the year-ago quarter, and revenue is down $7 billion.
* We’ve just finished up the conference call, where Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri discussed Apple’s performance over the three-month period, and offered up some insights into its future. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points from the call below.
* If you want to listen to today’s earnings call, a replay will be available here for a limited time.
