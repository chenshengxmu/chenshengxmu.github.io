title: Geohot to Release Untethered Jailbreak
---
* Geohot is back at it, this time with an untethered jailbreak for iPhone OS 3.X.
* This is what he wrote on his blog just minutes ago:
* The jailbreak is all software based, and is as simple to use as blackra1n. It is completely untethered, works on all current tethered models(ipt2, 3gs, ipt3), and will probably work on iPad too.
* Don’t ask about a release date. You won’t make it happen any sooner.
* I’d like to give you more details but I’m currently writing this from a car between Hanoi and Ninh Binh, Vietnam with obviously limited resources.
* It does look like this new jailbreak tool won’t be ready anytime soon, bu it’s still a good news for those of you who have to kickstart their iPhones with BlackRa1n everytime they reboot.
* Thoughts? Comments?
