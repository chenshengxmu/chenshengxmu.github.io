* Hot off the news of Steve Job’s 2nd medical leave in as many years, Apple has released its first quarter results, and unsurprisingly, the numbers are quite gaudy.
* “We had a phenomenal holiday quarter with record Mac, iPhone and iPad sales,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We are firing on all cylinders and we’ve got some exciting things in the pipeline for this year including iPhone 4 on Verizon which customers can’t wait to get their hands on.”
* At 16.24 million sold, the iPhone’s numbers represent an 86% growth over the same period last year. The numbers for Apple’s other products, were just as impressive…
* Apple sold 19.45 million iPods, 7.33 million iPads, and 4.13 million Macs, during the same quarter.
* “We couldn’t be happier with the performance of our business, generating $9.8 billion in cash flow from operations during the December quarter,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter of 2011, we expect revenue of about $22 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share of about $4.90.”
* Again, this is good news for a company who is losing their CEO and visionary for the 2nd time in two years, as their stock slightly reflected the somber news that broke on Monday.
* By late afternoon today, the stock has all but rebounded in after hours trading sessions; a point owed to the well-timed planning of Apple’s quarterly earnings call.
* Do you think Apple maintain this momentum without Steve Jobs at the helm?
