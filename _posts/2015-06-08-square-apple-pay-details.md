* Square, a mobile payment startup founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, received an important mention during this morning’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote talk.
* In going through a laundry list of new Apple Pay features, an Apple executive said even more small businesses will be able to accept Apple Pay using a new contactless card reader by Square which plays nice with Apple Pay.
* Soon after the even has wrapped up, Square followed up with additional details about the forthcoming device.
* The new Square Reader has built-in battery and NFC, making it instantly compatible with Apple Pay which uses NFC for wireless transactions. Of course, NFC lets the accessory accept other contactless payments based on NFC, like Android Pay.
* “We built our new reader so every business in the neighborhood could accept Apple Pay and chip cards—because we believe everyone deserves faster, more secure transactions,” the company notes.
* Paying is as easy as simply tapping your iPhone or Apple Watch to the device. And like before, the reader can process standard EMV chip cards, too.
* Check out the accessory in a promotional video below.
* And if you’re quick and reserve your free reader now, they will kindly send the first 250,000 applicants who aren’t ready yet to make a jump into the 21st century a free Square magnetic stripe reader to swipe cards the old-fashioned way, too.
* It’s pretty great, Square’s somewhat high transaction fees notwithstanding.
* If I ran a small business that sold products to customers, I’d definitely give this device a try as it’s able to accept pretty much every way people want to pay.
* The new Square Reader is launching this fall, enabling even more small businesses to accept Apple Pay.
