* Conveniently, Apple’s added a 3D Flyover view of the Yosemite National Park in California and Wellington in New Zealand to its Maps service, available across Mac and iOS devices. The latest addition allows you to check out Yosemite’s landmarks, or the buildings and other structures in the city of Wellington.
* 3D Flyover views for the Auckland and Christchurch areas in New Zealand have been added to Apple Maps earlier in the year. The Cupertino company has updated the Flyover availability webpage by adding Wellington and Yosemite to the list…

* OS X 10.10, due later this year, is the second major OS X release to have been named after a major California landmark, the Yosemite National Park. After a decade of using cat names, Apple’s switched to naming major OS X releases after California landmarks, starting with Mavericks.
* The latest OS X Yosemite Developer Preview 6 has added several new images of the Yosemite National Park and we’ve made them available to download as wallpapers for your Mac and iOS devices.
* And when iOS 8 launches in September, users will be able to take advantage of all-new Flyover City Tours.
* As shown in the video below, this feature is based on a set of manually programmed and scripted virtual tours animated in the three-dimensional Flyover mode.
* In the past twelve months or so, Apple’s made a number of improvements to Maps data in China, Japan and other countries, while rolling out Flyover views to additional locations.
* At the time of this writing, 3D Flyover views were available for more than 90 cities, parks and important landmarks around the world, as per the iOS 7 Feature Availability webpage.
* Speaking of which, how do you like Flyovers in Apple Maps? Have you find some practical uses for it beyond showing it off to your non-iPhone-toting friends?
