* Do you snooze your alarm in the morning hoping to get up a few minutes later, but end up waking up late? If yes, you should definitely check out a new jailbreak tweak known as EQUAlarm that ensures you wake up on time.
* Developed by PAL Labs, EQUAlarm requires you to solve a math equation before you can disable it, which is a good way of sharpening your brain before getting up from your bed. When the alarm starts to ring, you’ll view a math problem along with number keys that allow you to enter the answer.
* If you’re smart enough to get the answer correct, you can snooze or dismiss the alarm. However, if you’re not good at maths and get stuck with a problem, it will continue to ring and drive you mad until you enter the answer correctly.
* Yet, more interesting is that the tweak allows you to choose the difficulty of the questions ranging from easy questions to insane ones that will churn your brain in the morning. For instance, an easy question would be 24-14, but if you opt in for insane questions, an example would be (24 x 14) + 69.
* As usual, once you install it, you can configure it from its preference pane in the stock Settings app. There, you can enable or disable the tweak on demand, choose the difficulty of the questions as well as view the average percentage of questions answered correctly. You can also test the alarm once you’ve chosen a difficulty level to select the one that matches your maths skills.
* EQUAlarm is quite an interesting tweak, but can drive you mad if you’re not able to answer an equation correctly. If you want to give this tweak a try, head to Cydia now and purchase it from BigBoss repository for $0.99.
