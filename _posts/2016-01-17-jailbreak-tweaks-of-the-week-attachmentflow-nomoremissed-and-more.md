* It’s been a relatively quiet week for Cydia, but there have been some nifty jailbreak tweak releases this week that are worth trying out. In this piece, we’ll show you our favorites that we had the opportunity to try first and then recap on the rest of the releases afterwards.
* Despite some of the smaller tweaks released this week that don’t offer a whole lot of function, there were some releases that impressed us, and these are the ones we found the most exciting that we’ve decided to share with you first:

* AttachmentFlow is my favorite release this week because it offers a type of functionality that I can actually see myself using on a daily basis. With this tweak, you can preview attachments from e-mails in your inbox directly from your inbox without even having to open your e-mails to see them.
* With configurable options, you can tailor this tweak to work just how you want it to, serving your favorite filetypes and ignoring those that you don’t care so much to see. You can even preview files right from the inbox view and access sharing options, which is also a very useful feature.

* NoMoreMissed is also a solid release that we showed you this week, and it’s a solid release because it has a legitimate reason for existing. The problem with some notifications is that they appear when you’re busy and you completely forget to respond to them as you continue throughout your busy day.
* This tweak’s intention is to help you remember your notifications by allowing you to set custom intervals and reminders that will remind you of your notifications over and over until you acknowledge them. The notifications that the tweak supports include those from the Messages app, Phone app, and even from supported third-party instant messaging apps from the App Store.
* You’ll be able to read more about how the tweak is configured and what apps it supports in our review.
