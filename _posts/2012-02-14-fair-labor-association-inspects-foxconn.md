title: Apple Confirms the Fair Labor Association has begun inspections of Foxconn
---
* After recently joining the Fair Labor Association, Apple confirmed that non-profit has already started inspection in Apple’s suppliers factories, including Foxconn:
* Apple® today announced that the Fair Labor Association will conduct special voluntary audits of Apple’s final assembly suppliers, including Foxconn factories in Shenzhen and Chengdu, China, at Apple’s request. A team of labor rights experts led by FLA president Auret van Heerden began the first inspections Monday morning at the facility in Shenzhen known as Foxconn City.
* I can only praise Tim Cook for the positive impact he is trying to make.
