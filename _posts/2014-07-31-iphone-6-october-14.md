* According to a rather dubious rumor published by MacRumors, citing a source familiar with an internal Apple Retail Store meeting, a senior Store Leader allegedly told staff that the whole month of October will be very busy for Apple Stores and the company itself, singling out October 14 as a particularly “immense” day for Apple.
* Furthermore, the company is apparently planning a media event for Tuesday, September 16, nearly a month ahead of the iPhone 6‘s assumed October 14 launch…
* Richard Padilla, writing for MacRumors:
* Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 6 on Tuesday, October 14 as the month itself will be an incredibly busy one for the company, according to a source that spoke to MacRumors citing an internal Apple Retail Store meeting.
* I’m having a hard time believing the report.
* The iPhone 4s, 5 and 5s/5c hit store shelves on a Friday, and in September. October 14 is a Tuesday, a highly dubious date for such a high-profile product launch.
* MacRumors speculates:
* The source claims that high customer demand and an ample supply due to a large production effort will motivate Apple to start iPhone 6 sales earlier in the week.
* The author was unable to learn whether Apple is gearing up to launch both the 4.7 and 5.5-inch version of the iPhone 6 in October. Last we heard, the bigger handset is facing production delays and won’t enter mass production until December.

* My two cents: the iPhone 6 will hit store shelves in September, on a Friday, as usual. The “immense” October 14 launch could easily refer to Apple’s highly-rumored wearable device, the iWatch.
* According to German wireless carrier Deutsche Telekom, and corroborated by a Chinese outlet, the iPhone 6 will launch on September 19, which is a Friday.
* So, again, the way things are right now – the iPhone 6 and iOS 8 should come out in September, as per usual. And October should be for OS X Yosemite, new iPads and new Macs.
* What say you?
* Will the new iPhone(s) go on sale in September or October?
