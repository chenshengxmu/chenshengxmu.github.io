* Developer The Iconfactory yesterday evening pushed a nice little update to Twitterrific for Mac, its popular Twitter client, bringing several appreciated enhancements just as Twitter has unexpectedly stopped support for its own Mac app.
* The new version brings important new features for users with multiple Twitter accounts, while adding verified and protected badges on user avatars, incorporating a new font and more.
* If you have more than one Twitter account, Twitterrific now makes it easy to tweet and browse your timeline. For starters, you can now right-click on a tweet’s Reply, Quote, Retweet or Like buttons to perform the action with any account without having to switch to it.
* ROUNDUP: A guide to 3 major Twitter clients
* Likewise, you can select an account from which you’d like to post your tweet by clicking your avatar in the tweet compose sheet. As mentioned, Twitter user avatars now show a verified badge on the lower-right corner. Private accounts also include a new badge on the avatar making it easier to distinguish them from public accounts.
* These new badges can be turned off in the app’s Appearance preferences, where you can also set the new Georgia serif font.
* Lastly, you can now turn off streaming if you prefer to manually refresh your timeline (via the Timeline menu or by pressing the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-R). This can be useful for viewing a noisy Twitter search or Voice Over users who have the timeline read aloud.
* Here’s the complete list of other improvements and fixes in Twitterrific 5.2.4 for macOS:
* The aforesaid updates are available at no additional charge to existing users of the app.
* Twitterrific for iOS, a freemium download from App Store, recently picked up haptics, chronological threads, a new unread indicator, a black theme for iPhone X and other perks.
* Twitterrific 5 for macOS is currently $7.99 in Mac App Store, a substantial savings of 60% on its regular price of $19.99.
