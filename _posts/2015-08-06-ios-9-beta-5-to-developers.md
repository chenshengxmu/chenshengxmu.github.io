* Apple on Thursday seeded the fifth beta of iOS 9 to developers. The update is available to registered developers as an over-the-air download via the Settings app for those on beta 4, or as a standalone download from Apple’s developer portal.
* Today’s release comes more than two weeks after Apple released the fourth beta to developers, which brought about redesigned Settings icons and other changes, and two months after it first unveiled the software during its WWDC keynote.
* iOS 9 brings about a number of reliability and performance improvements, as well as new features. Among those new features are Apple’s new News app, a revamped Notes app, enhanced Siri and Maps, and new multitasking options for iPad.
* We are installing the new beta now, and will be sure to let you know if we spot any major changes. If you see something we haven’t mentioned, feel free to tell us about it in the comments section below or via email at tips@idownloadblog.com.
