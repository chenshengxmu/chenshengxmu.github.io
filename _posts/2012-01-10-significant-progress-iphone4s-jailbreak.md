* The dream team of p0sixninja, MuscleNerd, planetbeing, and pod2g have made more progress on the iPhone 4S untether, according to a tweet from pod2g this morning. pod2g also extended out special thanks to saurik for his major contributions to the long-awaited project.
* It looks like the team has overcome one of the last major hurdles in preparing the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 untethered jailbreak for public distribution…
* The latest stumbling block involved difficulties with sandboxing, but those issues are no more as pod2g tweeted this morning:
* @MuscleNerd @saurik And greetings to @planetbeing for the coding + research. Really great stuff to escape from the sandbox.

* Now that the team has escaped the sandbox, they should be on the home stretch when it comes to packaging and releasing the jailbreak, although they acknowledge that there’s still no ETA:
* props to @saurik for major contributions to the A5 version of @pod2g‘s untether yesterday!(still no ETA, but moving forward)
* — MuscleNerd (@MuscleNerd) January 10, 2012
* Sad news for developers hoping to get their hands on the iPhone 4S untethered jailbreak early for testing tweak compatibility:
* Sorry, we can’t release the A5 for the developers, the exploit used have to be kept secret. I know this is unfair.
* — pod2g (@pod2g) January 10, 2012
* We can certainly understand where pod2g is coming from, seeing as someone leaked Comex’s 4.3.3 exploit prior to him releasing it. Be patient guys. They team indicated that it would come this week, and I’d say the likelihood of that is still high.
