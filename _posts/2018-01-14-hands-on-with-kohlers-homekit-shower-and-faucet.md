* Kohler has launched their Konnect program that includes toilets, showers, sinks, faucets, mirrors, and more. We went hands on with their first two HomeKit-equipped products at CES 2018.
* HomeKit support will initially be coming to the Sensate faucet, and the DTV+ shower system.
* The faucet will be able to be controlled with your voice, and can dispense specific amounts of water.
* The DTV+ shower system lets each user create their own shower scene including lights, steam, and temperature.

* Kohler will be adding new products to their Kohler Konnect line in the future, with other products including smart toilets and more, though they won’t all support HomeKit.
* They will soon be releasing a new smart mirror that builds in support for Amazon Alexa.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
