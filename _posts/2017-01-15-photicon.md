* A new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Photicon (short for Photos App + Icon) aims to add a little more excitement to your Photos app icon by making it dynamic, rather than static.
* With this effect, your icon will never be the same old icon ever again. It will change over time as you use your iPhone’s camera to snap photos on a regular basis.
* Photicon is designed to replace your Home screen’s Photos app icon with a thumbnail of the most recent photograph that you took, as shown below:

* Photicon also works with screenshots, so if you happen to take one at some point, you’ll see a thumbnail of your screenshot instead of one of your photographs, so keep that in mind.
* The tweak adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you’ll find a few options you can configure:

* Here, you have an option to enable or disable the tweak on demand, play with some aesthetic blur effects, and choose a specific album for use with the tweak.
* In terms of your blur effects, you can choose between having no blur at all, having a dark blur, or having a light bur. The slider lets you customize the blur amount so it’s not too weak or too strong for your tastes.
* Because some people might be worried of unwanted photos appearing on the Home screen as a result of Photicon, the Select Album option is quite handy. This lets you limit your sample pool to only the selected album, giving you full control over what photographs do appear on the Home screen with the tweak, and what photographs don’t.
* Overall, Photicon is a pretty simple tweak. Not everyone is going to like the idea of remnants from their Camera Roll being broadcasted on their Home screen, but some people are into that sort of thing, especially those who value the pictures they take of their family and want to see them all the time.
* If you’re interested in trying Photicon, you can download it for free on your jailbroken iOS 9 iPhone from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today.
