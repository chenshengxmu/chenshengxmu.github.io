* Today we’re going to talk about something a little different in the theming universe. I’d like to introduce to you a DreamBoard theme called ErgoHD.
* Now this isn’t your typical iPhone theme for a number of reasons, and the first reason of course being that it’s a DreamBoard theme and not your run of the mill WinterBoard affair.
* Secondly, Ergo HD is aiming primarily at the non-ambidextrous demographic, seeing as its main selling point is being able to use it comfortably with either hand.
* Sound interesting? Then check out this video walkthrough of Ergo HD…
* Hats off to the developer for aiming to make something unique, but in the end I think that the goal of pushing the dual-handed envelope hinders the theme more than helps it.
* Sure, the theme features the ability to switch between left-hand usage and right-hand usage, but it doesn’t offer much in the way of bells and whistles that most DreamBoard themes are known for.
* And even the ergonomics themselves are a mixed bag of chips. If you have small hands, then it’s likely you’ll be comfortable with the wheel-based navigation. If you have gargantuan-sized hands like yours truly, it’s going to be an experience fraught with evil hand-cramps.
* You’ve got to love the attempt at innovation, but in the end, there’s not much else there to make you want to continue using it.
* Maybe you have a different opinion about Ergo HD? I’d gladly like to hear your thoughts below.
* P.S. And who said we couldn’t use the iPhone in dual hand mode as-is? Just curious. Ergo HD can be purchased on the Cydia store or DreamStore for $2.99, and you must have a jailbroken iPhone in order to do so.
