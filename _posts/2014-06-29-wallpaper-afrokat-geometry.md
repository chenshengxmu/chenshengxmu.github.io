* Another Sunday, another set of wallpapers. As the World Cup continues to rage, you may want to go back in time. Last week, we featured World Cup wallpapers to help everyone get excited about the continuing world wide fútbol battle. For additional Wold Cup coverage, check out our latest Let’s Talk iOS podcast, which has armchair commentary from your favorite iDownloadBlog podcasters, @SébastienPage, @JeffBenjam, and @Melvco.
* Moving away from theme-related wallpapers this week, I am featuring a wallpaper set submitted by avid iDB reader, Afrokat. A frequenter among the involved readers, I have received items from him, time-to-time. Today, his simple geometric designs grace the Wallpapers of the Week section…
* Sometimes, going back to simplicity is the best. With many complex wallpapers and themes around the iOS fan base, I wanted to post some simple items for the minimalists among us. With normal colors,  simple shapes, and no blurring, Afrokat takes it back to basics. Make sure to give him a shout on Twitter @A_RTX.

* To keep the wallpaper section up and running, we rely both on our own exploration, as well as the creativity of our readership. As you can see, today’s feature was submitted from a reader… just like you! To keep engaged with the wallpaper posts, follow me @jim_gresham or send an email to jim@idownloadblog.com. A word of caution: your submissions must be formatted for an iOS device, not simply a photograph you snapped on your last beach vacation.
