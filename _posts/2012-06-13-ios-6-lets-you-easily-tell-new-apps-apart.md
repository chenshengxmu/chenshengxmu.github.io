* In case you weren’t sure what apps have been newly downloaded on your iDevice, iOS 6 is making this clearer than ever as it now displays a little blue “New” label in the corner of the app icon.
* I’m not sure it’s going to be one of those life changing new features but I like how it makes it clear that you have downloaded an app and haven’t launched it yet…
* I sometimes download application and kind of forget about them. Having the “New” label on top of an app icon definitely makes it stand out and might be a good reminder that you have yet to use this app.
* As usual, if you see anything new in iOS 6, please make sure to let us know.
