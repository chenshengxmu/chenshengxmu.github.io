* Amazon on Monday announced Sumerian, a new app platform of its own aimed at third-party developers who would like to build web-based virtual reality, augmented reality or 3D experiences with built-in launch support for Apple’s ARKit framework in iOS 11.
* Currently available as a free preview, Sumerian allows third-party developers to easily build and publish AR, VR or 3D apps using Amazon’s free tools that run in a web browser.
* No specialized programming or 3D graphics knowledge is required.
* Developers use ready-made app templates or upload 3D assets in the form of FBX and OBJ files to use in their scenes. They can even create a digital character who will narrate the scene, as well as choose its appearance and define its speech and behavior.

* They can choose the background for their scene, add objects and animate them.
* Developers can script the logic that controls an object’s behavior using Sumerian’s visual editor or JavaScript editor. When published, the completed scene is stored in the cloud and has a unique URL by which it’s easily accessible.

* Sumerian apps can run on mobile devices like iPhones and iPads, head-mounted headsets like Daydream, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, as well as digital signage or web browsers that support WebGL or WebVR graphics rendering.
* ARKit support is supported at launch, while support for the Unity engine and Android’s ARCore framework is planned for future iterations of Sumerian, as per the project’s Features webpage.
