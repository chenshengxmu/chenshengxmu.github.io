* Compose—the jailbreak tweak that allows you to add quick compose widgets to iOS—has been updated for iOS 7. In prior versions of the tweak, the quick compose widgets appeared in Notification Center, but with iOS 7, the compose widgets have been relocated to Control Center.
* The iOS 7 version of Compose features a bevy of quick compose shortcuts for apps like Tweetbot, BBM, WhatsApp, and more. It’s a great tweak for quickly accessing the composition assets for many of your favorite App Store apps. To catch a glimpse of how Compose works on iOS 7, take a look at our video walkthrough past the break.
* Compose works with CCLoader, a jailbreak tweak that allows you to add additional widgets to Control Center in iOS 7. Once you install Compose, you can venture into the CCLoader preferences to alter the location of the quick compose widgets within Control Center.

* The preferences for Compose contain two sections—left button and right button—and each section can be customized with any one of the follow quick compose widgets:
* Changing the quick compose buttons takes place immediately with no required respring. Each button features a custom glyph for the associated application, which contributes to the stock look of the tweak.
* I think that Compose for iOS 7 is a much better fit for Control Center than it was for Notification Center. It seems easier to access, and it fits the look and feel of Control Center in a perfect manner. Add in the fact that there are a ton of popular applications supported out of the box, and you have a winning combination.
* Compose for iOS 7 is available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99. It’s a highly recommended jailbreak tweak if you use any of the aforementioned apps that it supports. Sound off below in the comments with your thoughts and opinions.
