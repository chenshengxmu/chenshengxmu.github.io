* Yahoo is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the web this week and it’s been marking the occasion by refreshing its key products. Yesterday, the company pushed a new version of the Weather iOS app with new animations, pull-to-refresh for cover images and more.
* Today, Yahoo’s news-reading product with summarization technology got refreshed, too. News Digest version 1.1.1 is now available in the App Store, bringing with it background downloads of new content, new notification messages and more…
* Here’s what’s new in Yahoo News Digest 1.1.1:
* Unlike other news apps that flood you with content, News Digest presents you with a selection of most important stories, twice daily. News articles are selected using a combination of human curation and Yahoo’s summarization technology acquired as part of its $30 million purchase of the summarization startup Summly.

* If you haven’t checked out News Digest yet, do give it a try: its fresh approach to news coupled with the app’s elegant, clean user interface will win you over. I’ve made it part of my daily routine and it’s served me well as a tool to keep tabs on the day’s top headlines.
* Download Yahoo News Digest 1.1.1 free in the App Store.
* The app supports the iPhone and iPod touch (no native iPad interface) and requires iOS 7.0 or later.
