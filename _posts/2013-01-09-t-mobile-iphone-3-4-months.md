* Good news for T-Mobile subscribers looking to get their hands on the iPhone. In a new interview, the carrier’s CEO John Legere says it will begin offering Apple’s popular handset sooner rather than later.
* Legere first confirmed that his company would be becoming an official iPhone partner, as well as eliminating device subsidies, this year, back in December. And now he sees both happening in the next 3-4 months…
* Reuters (via The Next Web) reports:
* “Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) unit T-Mobile USA will start selling the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone in about three to four months and will enforce its plan to get rid of cellphone subsidies in a similar timeframe, according to Chief Executive John Legere.
* Legere declined to disclose details about the company’s agreement with Apple, except to say that T-Mobile USA’s timing for selling the smartphone would be sooner rather than later, along with its subsidy elimination plan.
* “They’re all, I would call them, in three to four months as opposed to six to nine months, Legere told Reuters in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.”
* Yesterday, Legere told Citi Global conference attendees that T-Mobile is currently tracking over 1.9 million iPhones on its network, and is adding 100k new ones every month. Not bad for not being an iPhone partner.
* As the article states, there’s no word yet on the details regarding the carrier’s deal with Apple, or what the iPhone will cost. But with T-Mobile soon getting rid of subsidies, it’s probably going to be expensive.
* The nation’s fourth largest wireless carrier has been preparing for the iPhone for some time now. In fact, it spent most of 2012 building out its iPhone-friendly HSPA+ network, which now covers over 100 markets.
