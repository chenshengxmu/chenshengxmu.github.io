* There’s been a lot of talk over the past few days regarding AT&T and the new FaceTime over cellular feature in  iOS 6. The carrier has yet to deny accusations that it will charge customers extra for Apple’s video calling service.
* But it looks like Sprint customers can rest easy. A spokesperson for the company has just confirmed that it has no intentions of charging their subscribers extra for the new FaceTime feature…
* The Wall Street Journal Reports:
* “Sprint Nextel Corp., which still offers unlimited data to new and existing users on its network, said it has no plans to erect pricing barriers to FaceTime.
* “We are committed to our unlimited data and that means not charging for data consumption based on the application,” a spokeswoman said.”
* As we’ve said before, Sprint’s dedication to unlimited data may prove to be pivotal for the carrier in the coming months. If the next iPhone, which is expected to drop sometime in October, really is LTE-capable, Sprint will have to find some way to market against carriers with bigger, faster 4G networks.
* But with Verizon already in the process of nudging its customers off of legacy unlimited plans, and AT&T recently announcing new data plans of its own, Sprint is certainly in a unique position. The question is, what will customers go for? Network speed and coverage, or bottomless data plans.
* Which one is more important to you?
