* Two weeks after it seeded tvOS 9.2 beta 2 to registered developers, the third tvOS 9.2 beta has been released, bringing with it Dictation support for onscreen text entry, as well as Siri support for App Store search.
* The tvOS 9.2 update is notable for adding several improvements to the Apple TV. These improvements include a native Podcasts app, Bluetooth keyboard support, an improved App Switcher, iCloud Photo Library, Conference Room Display Mode, and more.
* If you’re a developer, you can find details about the tvOS beta on Apple’s tvOS developer page. The tvOS 9.2 beta 3 release comes with a build number of 13Y5198c. We’ll be downloading and installing it to provide an update on what new features this latest beta update might include.
* The great thing about Dictation is that you can use it to input usernames and passwords one letter at a time. It’s pretty great. Just don’t say your password out loud with other people around:
