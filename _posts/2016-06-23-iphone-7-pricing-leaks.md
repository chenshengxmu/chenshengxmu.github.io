* Citing a post on Chinese social network Weibo, PocketNow reported this morning that the flagship 256-gigabyte version of the iPhone 7 Plus could price-match the top-of-the-line 128-gigabyte iPhone 6s Plus model. According to the leaked pricing, the next iPhone lineup would include 32/64/256GB models for the 4.7-inch iPhone 7.
* Its bigger brother, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, somewhat strangely gets listed with 32/128/256GB storage choices. The Chinese price list also mentions a brand new model for the upcoming iPhone refresh, referred to as ‘iPhone 7 Pro’.
* Without mentioning how the iPhone 7 Pro might differ from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, the poster claims that that device will also come in 32/128/256GB variants.
* “In US equivalencies, we’re looking at a spread of prices from about $820 to $1,350, with the iPhone 7 Pro said to start near $1,080,” writes PocketNow. “Subtracting the 20 percent premium that our Far East friends pay for Apple’s exports, we might expect the 32GB iPhone 7 Pro to be set at the $849 level.”
* Basically, you’re looking at a $150 premium on the iPhone 7 Pro versus the rumored iPhone 7 Plus pricing, based on today’s exchange rate for the Chinese yuan currency.
* By comparison, the new 16GB iPhone 6s model comes in at $649 contract-free in the United States. The 64/128GB versions are $749/$849. The contract-free 16/64/128GB editions of the iPhone 7 Plus are respectively priced at $749/$849/$949.
* Again, these are US prices. Elsewhere, the iPhone commands a varying premium due to import taxes, currency fluctuations and local sourcing norms.
* The unanswered question: what the heck is iPhone 7 Pro?
