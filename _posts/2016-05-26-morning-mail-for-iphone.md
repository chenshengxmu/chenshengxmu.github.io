* Instead of waking up to tons of unread messages, most of which are probably spam, wouldn’t it be nice if your email client separated new messages from the other ones, so that weeding through your inbox in the morning were a breeze?
* That’s exactly the problem that a free iPhone app by Moscow-based developer Andrey Usoltsev, aptly named Morning Mail, solves efficiently with its focus on natural gestures and simplicity.
* Billed as “Tinder for mail”, this lightweight app shows only one new email at a time, presented in the form of a card that you can swipe away. Other gestures are available for sorting out your morning emails easily, but email die-hards can optionally explore their messages in the traditional list view as well.
* After launching the app, you will be asked to connect with your favorite email service. Morning Mail supports Gmail, iCloud and Yahoo Mail accounts but you can only add one account without upgrading via the In-App Purchase mechanism.

* If you’re one of the people who always want to keep their inbox clean, Morning Mail will help you get to inbox zero by separating new emails from other mail, so that you can deal with them in the morning more easily. In the video below, you can see how the app represents new emails as cards which can easily be sorted out with simple gestures, one at a time.
* To delete the message, swipe its card to the left. Swiping to the right archives the message while swiping down marks it as read/unread. You can also perform these actions by tapping the three icons at the bottom of the email card.
* If you’d rather sort through your emails in list view, you can.
* Just tap the Inbox tab alongside the bottom to view your emails in the traditional list view. Individual messages can be swiped left/right in list view to delete/archive them. To see your archived messages, tap the Archive tab at the bottom.

* Tapping the More tab shows you additional mailboxes, such as Trash, Sent, Junk and more, depending on your account type.
* Tapping the Pencil icon in the tab area alongside the bottom launches a compose sheet, allowing you to quickly fire up a message to a contact. It’s interesting that Morning Mail supports sending multiple photo attachments.

* Just tap the blue Attachments icon in the message body, choose Add Photo and then select an image from your Photos library to attach to the message. Tapping the button again lets you review your attachments, add more photos to the message and remove ones you have already attached.
* As mentioned, you only get to use a single email account at a time.
* Adding additional accounts requires a one-time 99-cent In-App Purchase per account, or you can buy a $4.99 Unlimited upgrade to add as many inboxes as you like.
* Thankfully, developer has added another interesting upgrade option for those short on cash: Pay by Share. With Pay by Share, tweeting out about the app or sharing Morning Mail on Facebook gives you an additional inbox at no charge.

* This is probably the smartest way to have the best of both worlds: a freemium app that anyone can download and start using without paying a cent, with the option to support the developer by purchasing additional accounts or get a bonus mailbox by helping spread the word about Morning Mailbox on social media.

* In its upcoming update, Morning Mail will bring out the snooze feature.
* If you don’t want to determine whether the message at hand should be deleted, read or archived and would like to deal with it at a later stage, you will be able to swipe up to reveal the Snooze option, as evidenced on the teaser image below.

* As you can see for yourself, emails can be snoozed until later today (6pm), tomorrow (8am) or next week (Monday at 9am). Usoltsev has not said whether there will be a setting to customize snooze times as it would certainly make a nice addition.
* The developer is also working on an Android edition of Morning Mail and has confirmed that a future update will add support for labels and Outlook.com/Exchange accounts, Yandex Mail and a bunch of other providers, support for signatures, push notifications, the ability to customize swipe actions and more.
* Morning Mail requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later. The app is English-only and lacks a native watchOS 2 component for your Apple Watch and iPad-optimized interface.
* Download Morning Mail free of charge from the App Store.
