* With the iPhone 6 expected to get one of its largest redesigns ever, designers have spent the last year creating concepts of what they believe the handset will look like. Some of them would probably be better suited for a science fiction novel, but others have looked fairly plausible.
* This latest concept from well-known designer Martin Hajek may be one of the most realistic we’ve ever seen. Based on leaked parts, physical mockups and rumors from multiple tech outlets, Hajek has laid out his vision for the iPhone 6 right down to the circuits on the logic board…

* This particular concept, first shared by Nowhereelse.fr, shows the 4.7-inch iPhone 6—one of 2 models expected to launch this fall. We have seen a few part leaks for the larger, 5.5-inch model, but they have been far less frequent, and many folks believe the device has been delayed.
* The details in the images line up with everything we’ve heard and seen thus far—from the elongated volume buttons, to the relocated Power toggle. The only potential discrepancy I could find was the rear antenna breaks, which are far less prominent than those seen in part leaks.

* In addition to a larger screen, the iPhone 6 is also expected to feature a higher resolution display and faster A8 processor. We’ve also heard that it could feature NFC technology, and several new sensors capable of measuring things like air pressure, temperature, humidity, and more.
* As for the device’s battery, we’ve heard a few conflicting reports on its size and power. We’ve seen photos of an 1,810mAh battery allegedly belonging to the handset, but a more recent claim from ESM-China analyst Sung Chang Xu suggests that it will be of a larger 2,100mAh variety.

* Yesterday, John Paczkowski of Re/code reported that Apple is planning to unveil the iPhone 6 at a media event on Tuesday, September 9th. Apple hasn’t made the date official yet, but given Paczkowski’s near-perfect track record, I’d say it’s time to start getting your credit cards ready.
* What do you think of the above iPhone 6 concept? Would you buy one?
