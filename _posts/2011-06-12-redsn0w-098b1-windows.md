* A couple days ago, the Dev Team released the first jailbreak for iOS 5 beta 1, via RedSn0w 0.9.8b1, a tool that was Mac only until today. Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd tweeted moments ago that RedSn0w 0.9.8b1 is now also compatible with Windows.
* Like we mentioned when we first reported about this latest version of RedSn0w, jailbreaking iOS 5 is recommended for developers only as many jailbreak apps are “broken” and do not work properly for the time being…
* If you’re still tempted to have a glimpse at the new awesome jailbreak apps that are being developed for iOS 5, then go ahead, but at least you’ve been warned. Of course, you will need to already be running iOS 5 beta 1, and then use RedSn0w to jailbreak.
* This jailbreak will work with all devices that can run iOS 5, except for the iPad 2. We hear Comex might revive JailbreakMe and come back with an iPad 2 jailbreak so don’t lose hope to see Cydia running soon on this device.
* As usual, you can find RedSn0w 0.9.8b1 in our downloads section and follow our RedSn0w guide for a step-by-step tutorial.
* Any question or comments, feel free to raise your voice below.
