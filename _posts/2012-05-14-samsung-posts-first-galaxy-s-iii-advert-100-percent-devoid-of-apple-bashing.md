* South Korea-headquartered Samsung, now the top smartphone and cell phone vendor in the world, just posted on its YouTube channel the first official advertising for its latest would-be iPhone-killer, the flagship Galaxy S III handset unveiled less than two weeks ago.
* Unlike last year’s Samsunged campaign, this high-profile advert is free of any direct or implied Apple spoofing. Even though it does ignore some pretty important marketing basics, the commercial is kinda cool (if I wanted to be cynical about it, I’d call it a typical agency bulls**t).
* If anything, one’s gotta appreciate Samsung’s focus on establishing an emotional connection with the viewer in a manner that resembles Apple’s Siri advertising. Have a look and tell us whether this Galaxy commercial is a match for the world’s greatest marketing machine…
* This is basically the same video Samsung showed at the “Mobile Unpacked” event in London’s Earls Court earlier this month.
* A description on YouTube includes this blurb:
* Effortlessly smart and intuitively simple, Samsung GALAXY S III reveals a new concept of smartphone.
* Designed for humans and inspired by nature, the GALAXY S III is a smartphone that recognizes your voice, understands your intention, and lets you share a moment instantly and easily.
* Though S-Voice is playing a catch-up to Siri, Samsung has realized its handset advertising should focus on a select few key features that stick in mind.
* As for the features the advert omits, I’d certainly highlight ten-hour talk time.
* Speaking of which, web browsing really kills the battery thanks to predominantly white web pages that, coupled with a monstrous AMOLED display, suck up the juice in no time, putting the phone at No. 14 behind all rivals in web browsing battery tests.
* As for the commercial, Samsung got the creative concept right this time.
* From the official unveiling to this advertisement (and beyond), Samsung keeps on telling prospective buyers that the Galaxy S III is “inspired by nature” because the phone can tell what you want to do before you set out to do it.
* That’s quite memorable and original a tagline in my book.
* The Galaxy S III is not just a fine phone, it’s an outstanding device and as such justifies heavy marketing spending.
* Contrary to other phone vendors, only Apple and Samsung appear to have the marketing mojo to get the word out about their flagship products in a way that strikes a chord with buyers.
* When was the last time you saw a really cool advertisement for a Sony Ericsson device?
* Can you recall any memorable advert for a Motorola phone over the past twelve months?
* Didn’t think so.
