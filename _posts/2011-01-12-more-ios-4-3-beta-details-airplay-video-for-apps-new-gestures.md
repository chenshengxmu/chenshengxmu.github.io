* More information is trickling in regarding the new features packed into iOS 4.3 beta, and for fans of AirPlay, it looks like we have a winner.
* As you’re likely already aware of, Apple significantly gimped the functionality of AirPlay in their iOS 4.2.1 release, only allowing streaming from the iPod and YouTube apps. This led jailbreak developers to release tweaks like AllPlay and AirVideoEnabler to circumvent the lack of 3rd party app support.
* The good news is that with iOS 4.3, these tweaks should no longer be necessary…

* Mac Rumors is reporting that, along with the suspected hotspot features on display at yesterday’s Verizon event, a few other nifty surprises seem to have made the cut.
* The highlight of these surprises, for iPhone owners that is, is of course AirPlay Video support for third party apps. Now, you won’t simply be limited to the iPod and YouTube apps for transmitting video to your supporting AirPlay enabled devices like the Apple TV G2.
* Along with the extended AirPlay support, iPad owners have reason to rejoice over what appear to be enhanced gestures geared towards the device’s increased screen real estate. Could this mean that the iPad 2 is right around the corner? Very likely.
* There’s sure to be more to come out after folks have had enough time to fully explore all of the changes. We’ll have a full updated list of all the changes you can expect in a future update.
* Until then, I’m just curious, how many of you out there use AirPlay? And are you looking forward to this change?
