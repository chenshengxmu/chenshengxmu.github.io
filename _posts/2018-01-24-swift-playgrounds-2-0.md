* Swift Playgrounds, Apple’s excellent iPad-only app aimed at children and wannabe developers that makes it fun to learn and experiment with code—has gotten even better.
* The new Swift Playgrounds 2.0 includes several new features to help you discover even more content, subscribe to playgrounds from your favorite third-party creators and more.
* After subscribing to a desired playground, you can browse and download its content directly within the app. You’ll be notified when your favorite creators publish new content and shall automatically see any new or updated playgrounds in your subscriptions.
* “Third-party robot playgrounds previously included in the app are now available directly from their respective authors when you browse subscriptions,” Apple cautions.
* A new content gallery shows all your playgrounds in a single accessible view, in addition to other new content like any new robots and more. Speaking of which, Swift Playgrounds 2.0 brings a few new robots including IBM’s TJBot and Mekamon.
* Both are available from the Add Subscriptions button.
* I’m especially liking that Apple has made its tremendously useful documentation for various iOS features and commands readily available from the app’s Help button and the tools menu. And if you notice a new Locations button, it’s for opening playgrounds from iOS 11’s Files app.
* Swift Playgrounds 2.0 is a free download from App Store.
