* Apple has made some changes to paid iCloud storage upgrades.
* Having nixed the previously available one-terabyte tier, the company has now made its flagship two-terabyte plan more affordable than ever.
* You can now get a whopping two terabytes of storage in exchange for a pretty competitive monthly fee of just $9.99 per month, or half the previous asking price of $19.99 per month.
* As mentioned, the 1TB plan that used to cost $9.99 per month has been eliminated. The 200GB $2.99 per month and the 50GB $0.99 per month tiers have remained unchanged. The free tier is still limited to just five gigabytes of storage.
* According to Apple’s iCloud webpage, the following storage tiers are now available:
* The new pricing is available in all markets.
* You can use iCloud storage to store your entire Photos library, backup all the Apple devices you own, synchronize files between devices, keeping other files in your iCloud Drive, store your iCloud Mail message archive and much more.

* And with iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, Apple customers can now share a 200GB or 2TB iCloud storage plan with family members, if they like.
* “Now you can share an iCloud storage plan with your entire family, notes Apple. “Choose 200GB or 2TB and give everyone space to store photos, videos, documents and more.
* You can upgrade your iCloud storage directly on your device in Settings → General → Storage & iCloud Usage, then tap Manage Storage under the iCloud section and hit Change Storage Plan. On a Mac, go to System Preferences → iCloud → Manage for these options.
