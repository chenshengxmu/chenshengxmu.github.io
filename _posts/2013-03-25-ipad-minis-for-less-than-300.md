* Folks thinking about buying an iPad mini, but just can’t get over the tablet’s exorbitant $330+ price tag, will be happy to hear that you can now get one for less than $300 from Apple’s web store.
* The company began offering a handful of refurbished iPad mini models, alongside fourth-gen iPads, earlier this month. And they’ve just added black and white 16GB Wi-Fi-only models to the mix…
* As noted by 9to5Mac, Apple added its entry-level iPad mini to its refurbished inventory online this weekend. The discount is only 9%, good for just $30 off, but it still gets you a mini for under $300.
* This brings the 7.9-inch device in line with Apple’s cheapest tablet—the 16GB Wi-Fi iPad 2. Though it’s worth noting that it sells new iPad 2s at that price, where as these minis have been recertified.
* But Apple’s refurbished offerings aren’t your average used products. They’re highly regarded in the consumer electronics space, and come with new batteries, new backs and a one-year Apple warranty.
* Of course, you may want to hold out on buying a mini at all, as a new one with a Retina display is expected in the next few months. But if you’re interested, you better act fast. These $299 units won’t last long.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
