* Apple just inked a deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the organization that manages Grand Central Terminal, New York’s world renowned train station.
* The deal will allow Apple to build it’s largest store to date, in the heart of New York where thousands of people commute daily…

* According to the Wall Street Journal:
* “Apple is paying Charlie Palmer’s Metrazur restaurant $5 million to vacate its space on the terminal’s east balcony more than eight years before its lease expires. The MTA will get significantly higher annual rent: $1.1 million from Apple vs. $263,997 from Metrazur.
* In addition to the space currently occupied by Metrazur, Apple will move into an adjacent, currently vacant balcony on the northeast side of the terminal.”
* Should the competent authorities approve the deal tomorrow (and yes, they will), Apple plans to open its store there within 4 months.
