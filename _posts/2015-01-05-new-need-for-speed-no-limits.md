* EA mobile today posted what it is calling the “Official Gameplay Teaser” for its upcoming Need for Speed: No Limits title. Like the previous teaser, it runs about 30 seconds long, but this time there’s a lot more in-game footage, and a lot less Ken Block.
* Unsurprisingly, the new Need for Speed is being built by Firemonkeys, the combined teams of Firemint and IronMonkey Studios, who both have extensive backgrounds in racing. The game will have a heavy focus on street racing and vehicle customization.
* We don’t have many other details about No Limits, but given all of the performance improvements we’ve seen in iPhones, iPads and iOS since the last Need for Speed dropped, it should easily be one of the year’s most highly anticipated mobile game releases.
