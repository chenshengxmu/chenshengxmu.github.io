* Apple sent an email to registered developers who are registered in Crimea on Sunday terminating their developer agreement with Apple and ceasing the development and distribution of apps. 
* The US in mid-December matched European sanctions blocking investments in or imports from Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia earlier this year.
* As such Apple is complying with the new laws, asking developers to destroy materials that may have been downloaded from the Apple Developer Center or used in the building of apps for the App Store, and barring them from uploading apps or app updates.
* The bar not only affects developers who live in Crimea, but US developers who are registered to make apps available in the region. The US order from December bans “the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to the Crimea region of Ukraine”.
