* Mac users who rely on the Mail app to send and receive emails can easily add a logo image to their email signature.
* Doing so can make your email signature look much more professional (or tacky, depending how you look at it), and in this tutorial we’ll show you how it’s done.
* You shouldn’t add just any image to your email signature. Generally what you want is a small logo of some sort that represents you or your company or business; you should always make sure it’s not too large and overpowering.
* The general rule of thumb is 100-200 pixels wide is just fine, and it should be wider than it is tall. Depending on the situation, your results may vary, but you don’t want a massive logo image that takes the attention away from the email text itself.
* If your image is any bigger, then we highly recommend cropping or scaling it in software like the Preview app, Pixelmator, or even Photoshop if you have it available to you.
* Once you’ve decided on a logo image to add to your email signature, you can follow the steps below to add it to your signature in the Mail app on your Mac:
* 1) Launch the Mail app.
* 2) Go to Mail → Preferences from the Menu Bar.

* 5) Locate an image file you want to use, then click and drag it into the text field:

* And you’ve just successfully added an image to your email signature via the Mail app! Just close the Preferences window and your changes will be saved automatically.
* Now whenever you send emails to someone else, they’re going to see your logo at the bottom of your emails in your signature. Pretty cool right?
