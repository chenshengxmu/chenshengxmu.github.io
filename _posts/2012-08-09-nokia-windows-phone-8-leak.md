title: Nokia's inaugural Windows Phone 8 has some familiar design

* One of the most common complaints I keep hearing about the yet-unreleased next iPhone is a sense of dissapointment over its overly unchanged appearance, even if from the design standpoint the iPhone 5 is much more than a rehash of the existing iPhone 4/4S design.
* Is you know, Apple’s upcoming device is said to sport a two-tone metal backplate (58 percent like it), a taller four-inch screen with new display technology, a relocated headphone jack and a much smaller dock connector with MagSafe-like functionality at the bottom.
* But it ain’t just Apple. Nokia, once a leader in cell phones and now an also-ran, figured its inaugural Windows Phone 8 handset shouldn’t change the design formula established with the sleek Windows Phone 7.5-powered Lumia 710. Heck, if the above leaked photo is the real deal, Nokia may not be willing to change the overall Lumia design much with the new handset…
* According to the Nokia Innovation blog, the upcoming Nokia phone has the same curved screen (though a bit bigger than the Lumia 900′s 4.3-inch display) and the same polycarbonate unibody form factor with irreplaceable battery.
* It will also support 4G LTE, have an external SD card slot and NFC chip on board and will run on a Qualcomm chipset, making it the first dual-core Windows Phone 8 device from Nokia.
* They call it the Nokia Phi and it’s one of three ‘hero’ devices set for an announcement at the Nokia World event in Helsinki, Finland, which runs from September 5 to September 6, just a week ahead of Apple’s planned September 12 iPhone 5 event.
* For comparison’s sake, here’s what the Windows Phone 7-driven Lumia 800 looks like.

* Notice any difference?
* Me neither.
* While Apple can afford to release an iPhone with virtually unchanged design (the iPhone 4/4S) due to its iconic status, the Lumia brand isn’t a household name (yet) so a totally different design might have been more prudent to promote this device as a ‘hero’ Windows Phone 8 handset.
* One thing playing to Nokia’s favor: as the embattled company re-launched itself into the smartphone race in October 2011 with the Lumia range, feature phone owners are in fact hearing more positive buzz about the brand, according to a YouGov BrandIndex survey.
* With about 50 percent of U.S. handset owners inevitably looking to upgrade to a smartphone at some point, their familiarity with the Lumia brand and perhaps an attractive postpaid push by the carriers could help re-establish Nokia’s presence in the U.S.
* After all, prepaid devices seem to be increasingly becoming all the rage these days.
* Would you consider Nokia’s upcoming Windows Phone 8 Lumia device?
