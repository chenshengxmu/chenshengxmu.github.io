* The Touch Bar shortcuts that had been available briefly in Chrome beta builds included shortcuts to some of the most commonly used actions, such as back/forward, reload, add to bookmarks, search or type URL, create new tab and more.
* The company says Chrome 58 is rolling out over the coming days and weeks so check back in a few days if you don’t have it already. The browser provides a silent updating mechanism to automatically keep your copy of Chrome up to date.
* To check for updates manually, choose About Google Chrome from the Chrome menu.
* Download Chrome for Mac, Windows or Linux directly from Google.
