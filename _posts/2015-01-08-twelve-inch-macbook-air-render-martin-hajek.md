* Our favorite rendering artist, Martin Hajek, has created a gorgeous batch of renderings based on the mockups and information from 9to5Mac’s scoop regarding Apple’s rumored one-port 12-inch Air.
* The images give a closer look at some of the rumored features of the purported notebook that’ve been making rounds, such as distinct iPhone-like finishes in Silver, Space Grey and Gold.
* I’ve included the gorgeous renderings for your enjoyment right below.
* Feast your eyes on the images and then join us in comments.

* The last rendering is of particular interest.
* It’s Hajek’s take on a recent rumor out of Taiwan calling for switching to laser cutting and advanced embedded technologies to make the logo emblazoned on all of Apple’s 2015 products 3D-like and shine at the edges.
* If 9to5Mac’s sources are to be trusted, the forthcoming machine should be a radical departure from existing design. In addition to narrower and thinner appearance, the new Air is said to sport an edge-to-edge keyboard with the reduced overall footprint of the individual keys.
* There are four new speaker grilles doubling as ventilation ports but most importantly, the notebook is thought to incorporate a single USB 3.1 Type-C port that should replace the previous USB ports, Lightning, MagSafe and an SD card slot.

* Not only does USB 3.1 Type-C carry a lot more power than any MagSafe connector, up to hundred watts of power, but moves chunks of data a lot faster: you’re looking at transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, or twice the 5Gbps available on USB 3.0.
* Still, half the respondents who voted in our yesterday’s poll are overly concerned about Apple’s decision to engineer a one-port notebook, saying it harkens back to the days of the original MacBook Air which was widely criticized for having just one USB port.
