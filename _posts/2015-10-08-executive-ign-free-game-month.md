* If your country isn’t included in this promotion, feel free to use an anonymous proxy web tool such as SmartHide Online Anonymizer, which doesn’t cost a dime and can help you bypass regional restrictions.
* Choose the US Anonymizer option on the SmartHide webpage, paste the IGN promo URL into the text field and tap the Begin Browsing button.
* SmartHide should fool IGN into believing you were visiting their website from the United States and allow you to claim your free download. If you get the message that this game is redeemable only through a US App Store account, just create yourself one to download this freebie.
* Riverman Media is two brothers, Jacob and Paul Stevens, who have dedicated their lives to the art of 2D game making.

* “The fighting engine evokes a cross between Street Fighter II and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, with controls designed from scratch to be ideal for touch screens,” Riverman boasts.
* The platforming segments require precise timing, similar to Elite Beat Agents but with an emphasis on visual timing instead of musical rhythm.

* “Both of these mechanics are brought together by the SP bar, which allows you to execute gesture-based special moves like flame kicks, health restoration, and even morphing your character’s arm into a silver spike to impale foes,” as per release notes.
* The Executive, a 432-megabyte download, requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.1 or later. The game is localized in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
