* If you’ve been keeping up to date on your jailbreak news recently, then you might already know about the new exploit that could potentially open some doors to an iOS 11 jailbreak (or a semi-jailbreak at the least).
* The latest iOS firmware the exploit works with is iOS 11.1.2. Anyone with even the slightest desire of jailbreaking iOS 11 may want to consider putting their device on iOS 11.1.2 as soon as possible before Apple closes the signing window. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how.
* There’s no guarantee that an iOS 11 jailbreak will ever materialize, but iOS 11.1.2 is the latest version of iOS that Ian Beer’s tfp0 exploit works on.
* I wouldn’t recommend upgrading your already-jailbroken device to iOS 11.1.2 (just in case you lose it for good), but that’s a tough decision you’ll have to make on your own. On the other hand, those already running iOS 11 have nothing to lose by putting their device on iOS 11.1.2 and crossing their fingers.
* Keep in mind that since iOS 11.2 launched to the public recently, it won’t be long before Apple stops signing iOS 11.1.2. That said, you only have a limited time to act. Weigh in all of your options and try to make a decision promptly, before it’s too late.
* To downgrade or upgrade your iOS device(s) to iOS 11.1.2, follow these steps:
* 1) Make sure iOS 11.1.2 is still being signed when you try to do this. Otherwise, you’re wasting your time. You can use IPSW.me to check any firmware’s signing status in real time.
* 2) Download the iOS 11.1.2 firmware file for each of the device(s) you intend to do this for:

* Note: the file size is around 2GB, depending on the device. Your download speeds may vary.
* 3) Plug your iOS device into your computer with a Lightning to USB cable and launch iTunes.
* Note: putting your device into DFU mode is highly-recommended (but not necessary) before proceeding.
* 4) Click on your connected device at the top left of the iTunes app:

* 5) If you are upgrading from an older version of iOS to iOS 11.1.2, then Option + Click (Mac) or Shift + Click (Windows) on the Check for Update… button.
* If you are downgrading from a newer version of iOS to iOS 11.1.2, then Option + Click (Mac) or Shift + Click (Windows) on the Restore… button:

* Note: the button text varies depending on whether you’re updating or restoring your iOS device.
* 8) iTunes will now begin updating or restoring your device (depending on what you’ve opted to do); this may take several minutes:

* Congratulations! Your device is now running iOS 11.1.2.
* There’s nothing else to do at this point besides sit and wait. You should avoid updating your device and keep it on iOS 11.1.2, as this is the latest firmware that Ian Beer’s tfp0 exploit supports.
* Although there’s no guarantee that an iOS 11 jailbreak will ever materialize, at least you now have the peace of mind that you did everything you could to prepare your device(s) ahead of time. With some luck, perhaps we’ll see another season of jailbreaking.
* Have you prepared your device(s) for iOS 11.1.2 yet? Let us know if you have or plan to in the comments section below.
