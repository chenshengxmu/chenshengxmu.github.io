* While we’ve already heard about Apple’s new iPad and Apple TV, a few more things are trickling out after the event that just wrapped up in California. Along with iOS 5.1 and the new iPhoto for iPad, Apple will also launch iTunes 10.6 this afternoon.
* There’s no word on new features, but it will of course feature support for iOS 5.1…
* As of now there is just a teaser page, with no ability to download the 10.6 update. We’ll let you know when we hear more.
* Update: Apple has just released iTunes 10.6, with the ability to play 1080P video. You can download the update through iTunes!
