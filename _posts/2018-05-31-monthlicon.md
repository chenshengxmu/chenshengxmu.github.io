* Quickly glancing at the Calendar app icon on your Home screen can be a fast and effective way to discern the date/day in a pinch, but iOS developer Maxwell Lang wanted to expand upon that idea with the release of a new free jailbreak tweak called Monthlicon.
* As the name of the tweak implies, Monthlicon keeps you informed of the current month in addition to the date and day. It does so by replacing the Calendar app’s Home screen label with the name of the month.
* You can see an example in the screenshot above, where the label now displays “May” as the name of the app rather than “Calendar.” Obviously, the name changes in real-time as the months progress.
* Would you really need this tweak? Probably not, but it’s a neat trinket to add to your jailbreak tweak arsenal if you enjoy making your Home screen stand out from those on stock devices.
* Moreover, the effect complements Apple’s trend of providing live Home screen icons for the current date and time in the Calendar and Clock app icons, and it does so in a subtle manner.
* Monthlicon doesn’t have any options to configure, so merely installing it makes the necessary changes to your device. You can revert to the stock Calendar app label text at any time by uninstalling the tweak from your device.
* If you want to give Monthlicon a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is only compatible with jailbroken iOS 11 devices, which is unfortunate if you’re running iOS 10 or earlier.
* What do you think about having the month as your Calendar app’s icon label? Share in the comments below.
