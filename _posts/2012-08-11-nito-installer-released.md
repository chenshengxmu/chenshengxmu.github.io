* The jailbroken Apple TV community has been awfully quiet as of late. There still hasn’t been any news on the ATV3 jailbreak, and there may never be, and innovation on the ATV2 front has sort of stalled.
* Until today, that is. Kevin Bradley, better known as nitoTV, has released a new utility for jailbroken Apple TVs called nito Installer. The app makes installing software on hacked ATVs easier than ever before…
* Unlike on the iPhone or iPad, there’s never really been an easy way to install jailbreak apps on the ATV. It’s easy to jailbreak the device, sure, but beyond that, the user is generally required to use SSH or Terminal commands to install third-party apps. And that’s where nito Installer comes in.
* Using nito Installer, you can now install apps like nitoTV or XBMC to your jailbroken Apple TV with the click of the mouse — literally. You can also use it to easily add XBMC plugins and run custom commands.
* If your ATV isn’t currently jailbroken, check out our step-by-step guide on how to do it. If you’re hesitant, we also have a section that covers all of the benefits of jailbreaking the Apple TV, and why we do it.
* Otherwise, feel free to go ahead and grab nito Installer from our Downloads page under Other Tools. Using it is pretty straightforward, but if you’re looking for help, we expect Jeff to be along shortly with a tutorial.
