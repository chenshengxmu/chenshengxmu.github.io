* In light of recent events involving the safety of third-party chargers for iOS devices, Apple has launched a new trade-in program for all unauthorized USB power adapters. The company made the announcement on its support site this afternoon.
* The ‘Takeback Program’ officially kicks off next week, and will allow users who have concerns about their USB power adapters to either drop them off at an Apple store for recycling, or trade them in towards the purchase of an official Apple power adapter…
* From the announcement:
* “Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third party adapters may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues. While not all third party adapters have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adapter Takeback Program to enable customers to acquire properly designed adapters.
* Customer safety is a top priority at Apple. That’s why all of our products — including USB power adapters for iPhone, iPad, and iPod — undergo rigorous testing for safety and reliability and are designed to meet government safety standards around the world.
* Starting August 16, 2013, if you have concerns about any of your USB power adapters, you can drop them off at an Apple Retail Store or at an Apple Authorized Service Provider. We will ensure that these adapters are disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.
* If you need a replacement adapter to charge your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, we recommend getting an Apple USB power adapter. For a limited time, you can purchase one Apple USB power adapter at a special price — $10 USD or approximate equivalent in local currency.”
* Those looking to get a discounted charger must bring their suspect USB power adapter along with an iOS device to an Apple Store or participating Authorized Service Provider. The special pricing is limited to one per device, and is valid until October 18, 2013.
* Apple’s move today comes after multiple reports surfaced in the media last month of users getting electrocuted while using their iOS devices. One woman died, and another was sent to the hospital after getting shocked while talking on their plugged-in iPhones.
* Both cases involved the use of unauthorized USB chargers, and Apple has since issued a charger advisory in China, warning folks of the dangers of using non-certified charging accessories and instructing them on how to identify genuine Apple adapters.
