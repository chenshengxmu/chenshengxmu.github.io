* iOS 4.3.1 has been out for less than a month, and Apple is already planning on releasing 4.3.2 in the coming week. According to BGR, iOS 4.3.2 will address minor bugs and several issues concerning the iPad.
* The folks at BGR have already gotten their hands on 4.3.2, and they claim that Apple will push the update for all iDevices in the next seven days…
* “One of our Apple sources has just let us know that Apple’s iOS 4.3.2, due within the next week or so, will fix the issues we’ve been hearing about with some Verizon iPad 2 models. Additionally, the new update is said to contain a fix for FaceTime in addition to security fixes for things like WebKit vulnerabilities and other minor changes.”
* We heard that 4.3.2 was on the distant horizon a few days ago, and it looks like Apple will indeed push the update soon.
* On the iPhone, there have been multiple complaints of battery and Wi-Fi issues on iOS 4.3.1. It doesn’t appear that Apple will be addressing any of these issues in 4.3.2.
* You can currently jailbreak iOS 4.3.1. As usual, do not update to 4.3.2 before a new jailbreak is released.
* 4.3.2 looks to be a very minor update that may not affect the iPhone at all, but we’ll keep you posted as more details are revealed.
* Have you been experiencing any problems on 4.3.1? If you’ve suffered from the FaceTime bug, 4.3.2 looks to be the fix.
