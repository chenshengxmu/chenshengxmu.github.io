* With over a hundred million active users, Google+ is, as Eric Schmidt put it, “a viable competitor to Facebook” and its nearly one billion users. This morning, the search firm is issuing new iOS and Android builds that enable a bunch of holiday treats. On the iOS side, you can now swipe through photo albums inline or tap once to see the photos full screen. New conversation cards are also available for highlighting specific content, from longer snippets to bigger photos to comments that slide in beneath each post…
* Google’s engineering boss Vic Gundotra announced new features in a Google+ post, writing that the iPhone app now applies “a subtle pan-zoom-scale effect to pictures in the stream”.
* Google+ on both the iPhone and iPad is a remarkably fluid app so the new eye-candy is like a cherry on top of the already sweet package. The app now supports Communities, a major Google+ feature added last week that lets users of all stripes congregate around topics of interest, post anything and chat in real-time with Hangouts.
* Finally, those who happen to be using Google+ as their primary blogging platform will also love bigger post photos and longer snippets.
