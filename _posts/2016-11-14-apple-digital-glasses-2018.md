* Apple is considering expanding into the digital glasses space, reports Bloomberg. Citing people familiar with the matter, the outlet says it’s still the exploration phase, but if the project is given the green light, the glasses could launch as early as 2018.
* The glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and project images and other information into the wearer’s field of vision. Sources say it’s possible that they could utilize augmented reality, and it seems likely given Apple’s public interest in the tech.
* Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added.
* Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment.
* With iPhone sales stagnating, Apple is under pressure to find success in new product categories. The wearables space is particularly hot right now, and several tech companies are exploring digital glasses, but the jury is still out on growth potential.
* Would you be interested in Apple-branded AR glasses that connect to your iPhone?
