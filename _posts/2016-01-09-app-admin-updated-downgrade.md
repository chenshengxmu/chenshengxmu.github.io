* App Admin (formerly App Control) is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to easily downgrade App Store apps on iOS. The tweak, which is still in beta, was met with positive response after it was released several days ago.
* After a few updates, App Admin is really starting to come into its own. Not only has it been blessed with new downgrade-centric features, but it also works on devices running older versions of iOS.
* The newest version of App Admin, version 1.0r-18, features the addition of a new option for quickly downgrading the previous version of an app. Other changes include iOS 7 support, and of course the rename from App Control to App Admin.

* The new option to downgrade to a previous version is of particular note, because this makes it possible to quickly get back to a previous version of an app in the event that an update breaks functionality.

* Another thing I’ve noticed is that there are lots more versions being displayed for many of the more popular apps. That’s due to the fact that more people are using App Admin, which updates the database with older version numbers that everyone can benefit from.
* App Admin is one of the best jailbreak tweaks that we’ve seen in quite some time, and it’s definitely worth checking out. If you’d like to try the beta, simply click here from your jailbroken iPhone.
