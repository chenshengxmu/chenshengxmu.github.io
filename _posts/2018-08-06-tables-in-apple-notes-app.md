* With the releases of iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra 10.13 came a cool new feature for the Notes app. You can now create tables in Apple Notes. This is handy for those times when paragraphs and lists just don’t cut it.
* If you haven’t used the table feature yet, here are the basics to get you started.
* 1) Open the Notes app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
* 2) Select an existing note or create a new one where you want to add the table.
* 3) Tap the Table button on the toolbar. On Mac, you can also select Format > Table.
* This will pop in a basic table with two rows and two columns. You can then start typing your data in the cells.
