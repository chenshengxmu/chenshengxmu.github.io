* Having acquired the popular news reader Pulse, LinkedIn, the social network for people in professional occupations, recently revamped its iPhone and Android application with a focus on updates, content-rich streams and new navigation options. Today, the team announced a standalone Contacts app, now available free on the App Store.
* “A smarter way to stay in touch with your most important relationships,” the new Contacts service is also available on LinkedIn.com, bringing all your contacts from your Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and other address books. Additionally, the application integrates with your email accounts and calendars…
* LinkedIn Contacts supports the following services: Gmail, Google Contacts, Google Calendar; Google Apps Mail, Contacts, Calendar; Yahoo! Mail, Contacts, Calendar; Outlook Mail, Contacts, Calendar; iPhone Address Book, LinkedIn CardMunch, Evernote and TripIt.
* You can also import CSV-formatted contacts from Outlook, Mac Address Book vCards and Yahoo! Contacts.
* From release notes:
* • All your contacts in one place – We bring together all of your address books, emails, and calendars, and keep them up to date so you don’t have to
* • Never miss an opportunity to stay in touch – Get alerted on job changes and birthdays in your network, a perfect opportunity to say hello
* • See where you left off the conversation – Review your most recent correspondence with a contact before picking up the phone
* • Discover more about who you’re meeting with – Prepare for your day with details on each person you’re meeting
* • Find the right person for the task at hand – Sort contacts by recent conversation and filter by company or location
* According to a blog post, Contacts will be initially available on an invite-only basis to a limited number of members in the United States.
* TechCrunch has a detailed overview up, if you’re interested to learn more.

* Once LinkedIn Contacts slurps up all your email accounts, calendars and address books, the service will automatically pull in the details of your past conversations and meetings, and bring these details directly onto your contact’s profile.
* Another benefit will include alerts on job changes and birthdays in your network.
* “Also, you can set reminders and add notes about the important people in your life,” the post reads.
* Hopefully LinkedIn Contacts won’t spam our contacts’ inboxes like Plaxo did.
* Here’s a video of the recently revamped LinkedIn application.
* More information about the changes is available in another LinkedIn blog post.
* The original LinkedIn app for the iPhone and iPad is a free download from the App Store.
