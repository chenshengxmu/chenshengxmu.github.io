* With Italy’s breathtaking Piazza Liberty store opening Thursday, Apple just gave eager fans an early look at the upcoming retail outlet that it says will revitalize a piazza in the center of Milan.
* The project, which includes both a grand public plaza and a store below, brings Apple’s latest retail design to Italy for the first time.
* Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail, was quoted as saying:
* There’s no better expression of our vision for Apple stores serving as modern-day gathering places than Apple Piazza Liberty. In a city with such rich history of art, entertainment and creativity, it’s an honor to establish a space where anyone can be inspired to learn, create and connect with their neighbors.
* The new retail outlet is located just off the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, which is one of the most popular pedestrian streets in Milan. Its trademark design treat is a dramatic glass fountain that doubles as both the entrance to the store and a backdrop to the large outdoor amphitheater.

* The staircase is situated between the middle of a pair of waterfalls that form part of a larger fountain—a tribute to the famous Italian squares that connect the city with its residents.
* Other highlights include:
* To celebrate the new store’s debut, Apple’s put together a nice webpage highlighting a collection of drawings, photographs and pieces of art created by cherry-picked artists and designers from all over Italy who’ve tried to capture a snapshot of the city’s creative energy.

* Jony Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer:
* To work within one of Italy’s historic piazzas is both a great responsibility and wonderful challenge. We combined two fundamental elements of the Italian piazza—water and stone—adding a glass portal that creates a multi-sensory experience as visitors enter the store through a cascading fountain that seems to envelop them.
* The store opens Thursday, July 26, at 5pm local time.
