* Apple recently released iOS 5.0.1 to the public in an attempt to fix the battery life issues that have been plaguing iPhone 4S owners on iOS 5.0. Prior to releasing 5.0.1 to the public, Apple seeded two developer betas of the software.
* While iOS 5.0.1 was intended to fix poor battery performance on particularly the iPhone 4S, Apple released a statement after the fact saying that, “We continue to investigate a few remaining issues.” Now, it seems that a new host of bugs have joined the mix for many users on iOS 5.0.1.
* As reported by GigaOM, poor battery life isn’t the only problem that many are facing on the newly-released iOS software. Some users seem to also be experiencing microphone failures, random Wi-Fi and cellular data dropouts, and a particularly weird bug involving contact recognition on the Verizon iPhone 4S. Many are still experiencing bad battery life as well on iOS 5.0.1
* An Apple Support Discussions thread has hundreds of pages of complaints about bugs in iOS 5, with 5.0.1 not appearing to fix most of the problems. Apple didn’t specify which bugs it still needed to fix after releasing 5.0.1, so there’s no telling how long it will be before these random bugs and glitches are fixed.
* The Startup Foundry details a bug on the Verizon iPhone 4S in which performing an OTA update to iOS 5.0.1 causes the phone’s contacts to become unrecognized. Besides this particular report, it seems that over-the-air updates worked very smoothly for most users when upgrading to iOS 5.0.1.
* Jailbreakers and unlockers have been warned to not update to iOS 5.0.1, as Apple has removed the ability to downgrade iOS 5 versions. Apple has apparently already stopped signing iOS 5.0, so those that are on 5.0.1 are now stuck.
* On my personal iPhone 4S, I haven’t noticed any differences in battery life performance. My iPhone’s battery lasts about the same as it did before when I used the time zone settings tip we detailed in iOS 5.0.
* If you’ve updated to iOS 5.0.1 already, how’s your iDevice’s battery life? Have you found any other bugs? Share them with us in the comments below!
