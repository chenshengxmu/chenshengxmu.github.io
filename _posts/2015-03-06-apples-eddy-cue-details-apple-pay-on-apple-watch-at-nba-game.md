* Apple’s software boss Eddy Cue, an avid Golden State Warriors fan, was on-hand at Oracle arena in Oakland on Saturday to help with the official rollout of Apple Pay at the team store, the second such to support the mobile payment technology.
* While we expect many details for the Apple Watch to be revealed on Monday, Mashable reports Cue, who was wearing a stainless steel Apple Watch, offered details on how Apple Pay will work with the wearable.
* Cue told the publication that as long as users have their iPhone nearby and their watch is unlocked, then they simply need to double tap the watch’s side button — no need for Touch ID or even a passcode. While Cue was wearing the Apple Watch, he used his iPhone 6 to make a purchase from the Golden State Warriors team store.
* “You don’t have to authenticate on the phone,” Cue explained. “Your watch has to be unlocked and your phone can unlock your watch and so it knows, if I took my watch off and gave it to you it would know. If I wanted to pay right now I could just pay with the watch and not have to take the phone out at all or unlock it.”
* Cue also confirmed that iPhone 5/5s users who have an Apple Watch will be able to make NFC payments with Apple. The iPhone 5/5s doesn’t have NFC built-in, however you can use the Apple Watch’s NFC to complete the purchase. Cue explained “you just type in your code, either on the watch or on your iPhone.”
* Want more on the Apple Watch? Apple is holding a press event on Monday at 10am PST/1pm EST. We’ll be bringing you the latest details and analysis on the Apple Watch – so sit tight.
