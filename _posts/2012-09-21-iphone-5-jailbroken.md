* It looks like Grant Paul, aka Chpwn, is in possession of a jailbroken iPhone 5.
* We canâ€™t really say much more, other than the fact that he posted a screenshot of Cydia running on the iPhone 5 a few moments ago. More details of the exciting news insideâ€¦
* Taller screens like Cydia too. ðŸ™‚ twitter.com/chpwn/status/2â€¦

* This is awesome news, for this to 1). Come from a respected jailbreak dev, and 2). For it to come on the same day of the iPhone 5 release. It also means that there is hope for jailbreaking A5X devices on iOS 6 as well.
* Also, I should mention, that if youâ€™re running iOS 6 on an older A4 device, you can already jailbreak now.
* Update: and hereâ€™s the Cydia home page.

* Looks nice, no? Again, thanks to Chpwn.
