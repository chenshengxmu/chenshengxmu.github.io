* Of all the smells you can wake up to in the morning, I would have to say that Bacon is perhaps the most alluring. Obviously, that’s not the case for everyone, but if I could, I would create an automatic bacon-cooker that I could program to start cooking bacon at 9am every morning.
* Fortunately, thanks to Oscar Mayer, all of that may not be necessary. The company has created a new device, aptly-named ‘Wake Up & Smell the Bacon,’ which pairs with your iPhone to create an alarm clock of sorts that can wake you up to the sound and smell of sizzling bacon…
* So your first question is probably: how does this magical device work? Well, there are two pieces in play: the iPhone app and the actual device. The  app takes care of the alarm setup and the audio side of things, and the device emits a pork-like fragrance (probably similar to this).
* Here’s a promo clip for the device via TUAW:

* So there’s good news and bad news. The bad news is that it doesn’t look like the Wake Up & Smell the Bacon device is available for purchase [yet?]—more details on Oscar Meyer’s website. The good news is you can still download the app and at least wake up to the sound of bacon.
* Thoughts?
