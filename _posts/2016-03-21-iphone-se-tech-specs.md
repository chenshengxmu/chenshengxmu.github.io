* For those that still want a smaller iPhone, Apple announced a new 4-inch handset at its ‘Let us loop you in’ event on Monday. Dubbed the iPhone SE, the device is practically the same (dimensionally) as the iPhone 5/5s, but has very different hardware inside.
* The cost-efficient price tag and the improved feature set are sure to attract customers come pre-ordering on Thursday, March 24th, so without further ado let’s get into the niddy griddy and show you the tech specs of the new iPhone SE.
* The iPhone SE comes with the same anodized aluminum finish that all your modern Apple tech is going to have. It comes with four color choices: Silver, Space Gray, Gold, or Rose Gold. Like other Apple devices, the color is accented along the Touch ID sensor and Apple logo on the back of the device.
