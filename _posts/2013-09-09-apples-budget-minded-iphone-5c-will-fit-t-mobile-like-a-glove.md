* Apple’s much-expected iPhone 5C, noted for its multi-colored plastic body and inexpensive price, could become known for something more: mortally wounding cellular contracts. The test could come this month as Apple unveils the less-expensive iPhone at around what analysts believe will be $400-$500, unsubsidized. For the first time, US carrier T-Mobile – which doesn’t require subscribers sign a two-year contract – will go head-to-head against traditional carriers AT&T and Verizon.
* Both carriers may lose customers to T-Mobile as all four domestic carriers offer the new iPhones simultaneously, analysts say. While both AT&T and Verizon provide a subsidy on the iPhone’s price in return for a two-year contract, T-Mobile lauds its absence of such a requirement. T-Mobile began selling the iPhone in April of 2013…
* “AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which used to be the only iPhone carriers, are now in jeopardy of losing users to T-Mobile’s more flexible service plans in an already saturated U.S. wireless industry beset by slowing growth,” reports Bloomberg.
* Industry observers describe the fourth-largest US carrier being “in the right place at the right time with the right product.”

* While much of the talk surrounding the iPhone 5C’s attraction has centered on China and India, where handset subsidies are not common, an inexpensive iPhone could benefit a carrier in the tight US cell phone market.

* T-Mobile’s unlimited 4G data on prepaid plans could be a nice fit for the less pricey, contract-free iPhone

* For domestic subscribers, AT&T and Verizon – the first two US carriers to offer the iPhone – are attractive due to their offers of lower-priced Apple handsets in exchange for a two-year commitment.
* Indeed, an unsubsidized iPhone costs $649, according to Bloomberg. Making the iPhone cheaper could increase T-Mobile’s no-contract plan.
* “The cheaper iPhone might fit T-Mobile’s budget plan like a glove,” Roger Entner an analyst at Recon Analytics, told Bloomberg.
