* The whole social networking phenomenon has really gotten out of hand. There are so many ways to connect with others that it is nearly impossible to keep track. Luckily for you, we’ve done the tracking so you don’t have to.
* Today’s list is for the best social networking apps to come out in 2014. The iDB team scoured the App Store to come up with the cream of the crop and nominated their favorites. Below is the winner of the vote, as well as the runner-ups and, of course, our all time favorite social networking app.

* This past February, Facebook changed the face of its book by adding an entirely new way to experience the social networking site. More than just a status update tracker, Paper makes it possible for users to keep track of stories that friends and family repost on their feeds. You can also select specific topics to have curated news items to appear on your Paper feed. What really makes this app stand out is how attractive the user interface is. It features magazine-like image and text combinations with articles that unfold before your eyes. You can also view high-resolution photos and watch full screen videos. The gesture-based controls round out the pleasantness. This app is available for free.

* Foursquare is one of the first check-in style social networking services to reach supermodel status. When it started, it was all the rage. But five years later, people are saying, “Foursquare is so five years ago.” Swarm is like a party finder for your mobile device. When you open the app, you’ll be able to see within seconds just how many of your friends are nearby. If you want them to come to you instead, check in and wait for the party to arrive. You can also send messages to your buddies to remind them to bring the drinks. An iOS 8 update that came out in October makes it possible for you to check in and see nearby friends right from your iPhone’s Lock screen. This app is available for free.

* Of course, here at iDB, we have strong opinions about what Twitter client is the best and we’ve decided that Tweetbot takes the crown. The major update to version 3 brought with it some fantastic new features that truly solidified its place in our hearts. With it, you can mute messages from users, sync direct messages, and more. The recent iOS 8 update added extensions for Share Sheet, and more. You can even favorite a tweet and reply without having to unlock your screen. If you browse the Internet with Tweetbot’s built-in browser, 1Password gives you extra security for password management. This app is available for $4.99.
