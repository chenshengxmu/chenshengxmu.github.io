* The best way to keep track of receipts is to take pictures. That way, if something happens, there is always a digital backup. Even with receipts, you would normally still have to enter expense information manually somewhere. Not with this app. It features an OCR scanner that translates images into text so you won’t have to type out everything you’ve purchased on your business trip. The scanner populates the information for you. This app is available for free.
