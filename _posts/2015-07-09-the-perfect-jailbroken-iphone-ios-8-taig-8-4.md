* Now that the iOS 8.4 jailbreak is out, I thought I’d create a new “Perfect Jailbroken iPhone” post for you. If you can remember, I started this series a very long time ago, and it has remained popular until this day.
* Lots of people want to know what makes a perfect jailbroken iPhone. Do you need the perfect jailbreak tweaks to make a perfect iPhone? Not necessarily.
* And just because a tweak or app makes this list, doesn’t means it’s my absolute favorite, or that I even use it everyday. The perfect jailbroken iPhone does not equal my favorite jailbroken iPhone.
* The name of the game here is practicality, usefulness, and improvement. With these tweaks + 1 theme for good measure, I put together an all star phone capable of doing very much.
* What do you think? Do you agree or disagree? Watch the video and judge for yourselves.
* This tweak can lock individual apps on your iPhone with Touch ID or with a passcode. It can secure the App Switcher, power down menu, and more. I really like the way the security animations look, and how they’re focused on each app icon that you secure.
* I included VirtualHome, because not only does it let you use your iPhone without pressing the Home button as much, but it also allows you to quickly unlock your phone without waking it beforehand. This does use a little bit of extra battery, but it’s so much faster, that I’m willing to make that compromise.
* The latest iOS 9 beta removed the SwipeSelection-esque feature from the iPhone, so the usefulness of SwipeSelection is very much still relevant. But even if Apple does end up including its version of SwipeSelection, the original is superior.
* Downloading apps larger than 100MB via cellular is possible with this staple tweak. Since lots of apps and games are over 100MB, I think this tweak is a no-brainer choice for the perfect jailbroken iPhone.
* Being able to download any file via Safari is wonderful. Say you’re away from the house, but you want to start downloading the latest iOS beta, so that when you get home, it’ll be ready to go. That’s just one scenario where Safari Downloader+ can come in handy.
* It’s basically the Finder for iOS. That alone makes it a must-have. It also lets you easily install .deb files from tweak developers.
* The best way to customize Control Center, hands-down. And the custom buttons with Activator actions is crazy-powerful. You can use this tweak just for its ability to add another icon to your app shortcut panel in Control Center, but Polus is much deeper than that if you’re willing to explore.
* If you download lots of Cydia tweaks, then this tweak is one of the best things to ever happen to Cydia. It’s simply amazing how much easier it makes installing and uninstalling multiple tweaks.
* If you’re a hardcore jailbreaker, then you probably have tons of third-party Cydia repos configured. This allows you to individually enable, disable, and backup your entire body of sources. Absolutely instrumental for serious jailbreakers.
* This is my one guilty pleasure on this list. To me, Android Solid makes the Wi-Fi and cellular signal bars look way better. I felt compelled to include at least one theme, and this was it. There are tons of other themes out there to try, but I feel that looks are so much more subjective than raw functionality, so I kept theming limited to this selection for the perfect jailbroken iPhone.
* What do you think about this list? Do you agree with my 10 selections? Keep in mind that I have lots of other jailbreak favorites, but If I had to pick 10 tweaks to permanently keep with me, and I could never add any others, these would be a hard 10 to pass up.
