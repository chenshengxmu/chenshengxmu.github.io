* Twelve South has just released an updated version of their SurfacePad cover for the iPhone X. There are several new enhancements in the new version, and I had a chance to test it out the past few days.
* Take a look at the SurfacePad for yourself in our quick video.

* I’ve always been a fan of the SurfacePad line. They are so minimalistic, but still offer some degree of protection. They work pretty well for me as I’ve always hated cases, and to a lesser extent, wallets.
* The last couple cases that I’ve taken a shine to have all been cases with room for a couple credit cards along the back. The iPhone X put an end to that, as I’d have to choose between wireless charging, and my cards on the back.

* That’s where folio-style cases come in. It seems folio cases have been rising in popularity as of late, with even Apple getting in on the game.
* When they released their leather folio alongside the iPhone X, it garnered a lot of attention. Personally, I was very impressed with it, though it carried a hefty price tag.
* The SurfacePad is different from most, because as it points out right on the box, it is not a case. It is more of a cover for your phone.
* This is pretty much the protection I want. Just enough to cover the front and back of my phone from any scratches the come from everyday use.
* It affixes using a removable adhesive right to the back of your phone, which means it doesn’t protect any of the edges of your phone.

* It also has a pair of card slots right in the front, making it a suitable wallet replacement for me.
* New in the iPhone X version is a pair of really useful features.
* First, it can instantly wake/sleep your phone whenever it opens/closes.

* Secondly, it can fold back into a display, perfect for watching a video or chatting on FaceTime.
* Using the SurfacePad each day, you notice all the little things, both good and bad.
* On the bad side, it can be irritating to constantly be opening and closing the folio.

* However, it alleviates this a little bit by automatically waking, and unlocking, the iPhone X whenever you open the case.
* I’m loving the convenience of having my cards quickly available, and the ability to prop the phone up for watching videos seems like it should have been here all along.
* I really enjoy the SurfacePad on my iPhone X. The colors all look great (I opted for teal, but black and cognac are also available).
* This new version also has an updated leather, using the full-grained leather from the Relaxed Leather cases. Not going to lie, while the full-grain leather gets a nice patina over time, I think I preferred the Napa leather they used previously.

* The full-grain leather does have a longer lifespan, which is better for your investment in the product. So it has that going for it.
* Really, the only thing I’d perhaps change is the adhesive on the back. I wish the adhesive only went halfway across, instead of full width. This would make it easily to remove, and re-adhere over time.
* I bought the original SurfacePad for my iPhone when it launched all those years ago. This newly updated version is just as great as the original, with a few welcomed improvements.

* The slim nature, and wealth of functionality makes this a no-brainer for me.
* They are available for order right now for the iPhone X as well as other iPhone and iPad models.
* You can pick it up for $49.99 from Amazon.
