* iOS developer Steven Troughton-Smith dug up some interesting code strings from HomePod’s version of iOS that may potentially provide valuable insight into iPhone 8’s virtual Home button.
* As Apple’s edge-to-edge handset is widely expected to ditch iPhone 7’s non-moving physical Home button and replace it with its virtual counterpart sitting in a so-called function area at the bottom of the OLED display, questions arose as to how the feature could be implemented.
* Red = New New iPhone “function area” and status bar. Blue = Current iPhone 7 content area. Yellow = Minuscule extra content space.
* In a tweet yesterday, Steven said that the virtual Home button is resizable and can be hidden and shown as needed. For instance, it automatically hides when video is playing fullscreen.
* The strings don’t provide any indication as to how small or large the button could get.
* The background of the bars extends underneath the button and there don’t seem to be any APIs that would permit developers to change the virtual Home button’s color programatically.
* No API for color styling is a bit of a bummer. That could be really fun.
* Though, it could also be really bad.

* “There is no evidence to suggest any app’s user interface moves to the Home button area at all,” he added. “No toolbars, no other junk.”
* This supports a thesis that the function area is reserved for the system, meaning apps won’t be permitted to add their own navigation buttons there, at least initially.
* very simply, that tab bar backgrounds extend beyond their regular bounds outside of the 'safe area' pic.twitter.com/MkOxxKIhIK

* All of these things are supported by API evidence.
* In other words, there’s a strong likelihood that this is what we’re going to see when iPhone 8 hits although we won’t know for sure until Apple announces the phone.
* So, what are you thoughts about the upcoming Home button changes on iPhone 8?
* Me likey, but how about you?
