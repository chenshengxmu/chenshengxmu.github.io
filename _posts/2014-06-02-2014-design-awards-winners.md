* Apple has selected twelve apps that it feels “combine design and technology in creative, compelling, and powerful ways” as its 2014 Design Awards winners. The company announced the winners as part of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco this afternoon.
* The winners are as follows: Sky Guide: View Stars Night or Day, Cinemagraph Pro, Storehouse – Visual Storytelling, Monument Valley, Threes!, DEVICE 6, Blek, Leo’s Fortune, Day One, Yahoo News Digest, Teachley: Addimals Adventure and PanoPerfect. Read ahead for a rundown of each app…
* I have personally played Monument Valley, Blek and Leo’s Fortune, and I am not surprised that the trio of games made this list. Every other app listed is also incredibly useful, so I recommend giving the list above a second look if you’re looking for new apps to try out.
* As there was an avalanche of news surrounding the WWDC keynote today, we will treat this post as App Recap for Monday. We’ll be back with regularly scheduled content tomorrow.
