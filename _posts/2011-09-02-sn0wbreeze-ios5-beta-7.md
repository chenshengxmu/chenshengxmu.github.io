* Today, jailbreak hacker iH8sn0w released Sn0wbreeze v2.8b7. This update now includes support for iOS 5 Beta 7. Sn0wbreeze is a jailbreak tool for Windows. Also, if you are new to jailbreaking, you can check our general guide here, and our Sn0wbreeze guide here.
* The last couple releases of Sn0wbreeze let you use iOS 5 betas without having a developer account and an activated UDID. Along with that, it removes the expiration of betas, making sure the beta will not expire on your device as it is supposed to do at a preset date and time…
* This is change long for this version of Sn0wbreeze:
* Supported Devices and Tethered?
* If you’re interested in downloading Sn0wbreeze, you can do so from the downloads section of our website.
