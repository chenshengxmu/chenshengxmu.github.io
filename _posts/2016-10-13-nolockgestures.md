* There are all kinds of swipe gestures you can access on the Lock screen, such as opening Control Center or Notification Center and even using the camera grabber to quickly take a point-and-shoot photo.
* While some people like these little shortcuts, not everyone wants them there all the time, so a new free jailbreak tweak called NoLockGestures lets you easily disable all these swipe gestures on demand.
* For what it’s worth, you can disable Control Center or Notification Center on the Lock screen in iOS individually already without this tweak and it even hides the grabbers from view, but there’s no official way of disabling the camera grabber.
* Moreover, if you ever wanted to disable everything for a short period of time and then re-enable it again later, there are so many preferences you have to dig through in the Settings app to make it happen, it can be a really cumbersome process.
* NoLockGestures is more convenient because you can toggle on or off all of the Lock screen shortcut gestures all at once on demand with a single toggle found at Settings → NoLockGestures:

* This is something you can toggle on when you believe someone else is going to be handling your device and you don’t want them accessing the camera, Control Center, or Notification Center from the Lock screen. It makes it super easy to toggle back off when you are in full control of your device again.
* When you toggle the tweak on or off, the results are immediate, so there’s no reason to respring your device after every settings change.
* It’s worth noting the tweak doesn’t disable the slide to unlock gesture, so you can still swipe to the left to get to your passcode interface if you ever have to.
* If you want to download NoLockGestures, you’ll find it in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for free. The tweak works on jailbroken iPhones running iOS 8 or 9.
