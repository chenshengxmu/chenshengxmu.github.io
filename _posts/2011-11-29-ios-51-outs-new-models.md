* Earlier today, Apple released the iOS 5.1 beta. As usual, hackers got right to work dissecting the software to see if there were any secrets hidden within its source code. Previous code-digging has uncovered features, like FaceTime over 3G.
* This time around, hackers seem to have stumbled on more than just unreleased features. 9to5Mac is reporting that the new iOS 5.1 beta contains information regarding multiple new Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV…
* We’ll start with the iPhone. Hidden within iOS 5.1’s source code is a reference to Apple’s next generation handset. The device appears to have been dubbed, at least internally, the iPhone 5,1. It’s believed that the jump from the current 4,1 identifier to 5,1 indicates significant changes to Apple’s next smartphone.
* Future iPad models are also revealed in the new software. iPad models 3,1 and 3,2 are referenced in the 5.1 beta. 9to5Mac believes that 3,1 and 3,2 are the new iPads due in March of next year, and that 2,4 could be the rumored Sprint-flavored Apple tablet, with possible WiMAX 4G capability.
* Finally, a new Apple TV model surfaces in 5.1. While we’ve seen references to a new Apple TV in previous versions of iOS 5, the device actually gets an internal codename in 5.1 — J33. You may recall that the iPhone 4S was spotted in iOS, months ahead of its unveiling, by its N94 codename.
* Apple has a big 6 months ahead of it. The new iPhone, supposedly due in June, is expected to be the iPhone 5 that everyone was hoping for this year. The iPad 3 is rumored to have a quad core processor and Retina-like display. And the new Apple TV is expected to at least get a processor upgrade to the dual core A5 and possibly bluetooth support.
* Excited yet? We are.
