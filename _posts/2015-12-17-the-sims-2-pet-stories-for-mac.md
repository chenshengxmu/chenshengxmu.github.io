* Tired of good ol’ Sims? How about Sims with pets? Based off of The Sims 2 engine, this classic Sims title returns to the Mac—courtesy of Electronic Arts and Aspyr Media—with updated graphics and several other enhancements and is available for the first time on the Mac exclusively through the Mac App Store.
* With native display support for Retina and 4K Macs, gesture support for zoom and rotate, drastically improved performance and other tweaks, you can now care for and train those lovable yet unpredictable pets as you compete for Best in Show at the most important local pet show of the year.
* For those who are unfamiliar with this game, The Sims 2: Pet Stories is all about competing for the first place in a local pet show. The game packs in 70 dog and 30 cat breeds, each with its own personality, and includes unlockable rewards.

* You can play in an open-ended freeplay mode or complete a pair of stories in Directed Story mode, which has you playing as either Alice—who must win the local dog competition with her puppy Sam in order to save her house—or Stephen, an executive chef “whose highly predictable life is thrown into chaos when he’s forced to take care of his cousin’s spoiled cat, Diva.”
