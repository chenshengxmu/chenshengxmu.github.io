title: iOS 5 to Include Even Deeper Twitter Integration, Letting You Tweet From Anywhere?

* We already know that iOS 5 will bring deep Twitter integration to iDevices. So far, we’ve confirmed that iOS 5 will let you tweet pictures from the Photos app, your location from the Maps app, and a link from Safari or the YouTube application.
* One thing we know it’s not doing at the moment is letting you send a tweet from anywhere, without attaching an image, your location, or a link. Well folks, it seems that Apple is working on a way to integrate Twitter even more with iOS, by letting you tweet from anywhere…
* While we don’t have any hard evidence confirming this information so far, we want to point you to a tweet that Jake Behrens, a developer for Apple, sent out yesterday. Do you see anything special in there?
* As you can tell, the tweet was sent via “iOS” but it doesn’t include any link, location, or picture. Furthermore, the content of this message smells like a test tweet to me.
* With today’s news that Cupertino might be looking into letting developers create widgets for iOS 5, I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple and Twitter were testing a new widget that would allow users to tweet from anywhere in iOS 5, just like qTweeter currently does for jailbreakers.
* I predict that the Twitter integration in iOS 5 will be even deeper than we previously thought. Who’s not excited about that?
