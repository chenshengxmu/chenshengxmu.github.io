* Just as soon as Apple corrects the bug that caused “i” to autocorrect to “A[?]”, there appears to be yet another one popping up. Several users are reporting that “it” is sometimes being auto-corrected to “I.T.” in iOS 11.
* We hypothesized last time around that it could be a machine learning bug, and it appears it has happened once again.
* There is a multitude of users who have taken to Twitter to let about know about this latest frustration.
* .@Apple I want to type it not I.t

* Until Apple issues a fix, there are very few things one can do to fix this issue yourself. Many users have said that rebooting doesn’t help.
* If you are having the issue, one temporary fix that might work is going into Settings, and setting up a text replacement for :”I.T.” to correct to “it”, though that isn’t guaranteed to work.
* Has this issue popped up for you? Let us know down below!
