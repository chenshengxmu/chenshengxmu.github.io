* In a recent post, we highlighted several different features that we’d like to see come to the Apple Watch by means of a jailbreak. One of those features was a web browser. As silly as it might seem, having a full browser available on your wrist would be kind of cool, if for none other reason than the fact that we can state that we have a full web browser on our wrists.
* Legendary jailbreak hacker, Comex, appears to have similar wants, as he’s shown off a web browser running on his Apple Watch. The details of how he accomplished such a feat are vague at this point, but it’s a definite step in the right direction.
* Since Flash was required for the original video, we filmed parts of it and put it on Vine for your convenience. To see the original, click here.

* The brief video shows Comex navigating around Google.com. He also posted a bonus screenshot to his Twitter account:

* As mentioned, exactly how Comex was able to pull this off is still vague, but it at least lets us know that we have some high-quality hackers looking into Apple Watch. That bodes well for a possible Apple Watch jailbreak in the future.
