* Apple is “completely blown away” by customer response to the iPhone and today its U.S. carrier partner AT&T has confirmed that the new device represents its fastest-selling iPhone as pre-orders have set a new sales record for the Dallas, Texas headquartered company.
* AT&T wrote in a statement published by Reuters:
* AT&T set a sales record with iPhone 5 over the weekend, making it the fastest-selling iPhone the company has ever offered.
* Customers ordered more iPhones from AT&T than any previous model, both on its first day of preorders and over the weekend.
* The company stopped short of giving us the numbers.
* iPhone 5 shipping times have dramatically been pushed back to up to 2-3 weeks at Apple’s online store a mere hour or two after Apple started accepting pre-orders. Soon thereafter, shipping times increased as the initial iPhone 5 stock at AT&T, Verizon and Sprint began dwindling.
* We know from Apple executives’ depositions during the Apple v. Samsung monster trial that Apple typically sees twice as much sales for the current iPhone model than all of the previous models combined.
* The iPhone 5 is slated to arrive on Friday, September 21, at 8am via online and retail stores of Apple and its carrier partners.
* Have you pre-ordered an iPhone 5 yet?
