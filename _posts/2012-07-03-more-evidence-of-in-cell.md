* Information regarding the next iPhone has been fairly scarce over the past few weeks. Which is kind of odd, considering that the handset is believed to already be in full production.
* But there is a new report out this morning on the upcoming smartphone. And it adds weight to previous rumors that the next iPhone will feature all new in-cell touch panels…
* AppleInsider reports:
* “Touch panel maker Wintek on Tuesday announced that its June sales were down an unusually high 33.6 percent month over month, signaling that the company may have lost out on key orders for Apple’s next-generation products, namely a new iPhone rumored to have in-cell touch panel technology.”
* The piece goes on to say that this is the largest month-over-month sales drop Wintek has seen in 5 years — since the original iPhone debuted. So this certainly falls in line with previous reports that Apple has tapped Sony to provide in-cell touch panels for its new handset.
* As we’ve explained before, in-cell touch screens are substantially thinner than (the current) on-cell panels. And by using them, Apple would be able to add an LTE radio, a bigger battery, and other upgraded components to the next iPhone, without making it any thicker.
* The sixth-generation iPhone is widely expected to land in October of this year, with a 4-inch display and several other enhancements over its predecessor.
