* A Florida company named CustomPlay yesterday filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida over the Siri-powered ‘What Did He/She Say?’ feature used in tvOS on the fourth-generation Apple TV.
* The phrase can be used while watching a movie to quickly rewind 15 seconds with subtitles temporarily turned on to help users catch any dialogue they may have missed.
* CustomPlay alleges that the feature violates its invention, U.S. Patent No. 6,408,128 B1 for “Replaying with supplementary information a segment of a video”.
* The patent was first filed for in 1998 and granted to CustomPay in 2002.
* According to MacRumors, CustomPlay has requested a jury trial but the case has yet to be assigned to a judge. The patent details a remote control capable of activating a replay function way of a dedicated “What?” button, key or other function key to cause the system to:
* i) rewind or skip backwards the playing of the video a system default or a viewer specific previously defined amount, e.g. 20 seconds
* ii) turn on the subtitle to a system default or a viewer specific previously selected subtitle language.
* CustomPlay alleges Apple has used and continues to use its patented technology in tvOS without a license even though it was aware of the patent, with court documents revealing the firm mailed letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook and three iTunes executives in July 2014.
* There is no indication of Apple responding to the letters.
* MacRumors has determined that CustomPlay is affiliated with non-practicing entity Nissim Corporation, which sued Apple last September for allegedly infringing upon seven patents related to DVD specifications.
* The two companies reached an unknown settlement in December.
* CustomPlay is seeking damages of an undetermined amount from Apple, plus legal costs.
