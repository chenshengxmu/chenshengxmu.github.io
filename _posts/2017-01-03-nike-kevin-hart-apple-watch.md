* Nike on Tuesday posted 7 new videos promoting the Apple Watch Nike+ featuring celebrity Kevin Hart. Hart was issued the first Nike+ Apple Watch back in October of last year, and the ads offer a look at what he has been up to since.
* As you’d expect with Hart, the videos are pretty funny, portraying the comedian on an introspective 700+ mile run into the desert. Throughout the clips he can be seen running in Nike gear, and showing off various Apple Watch features.
* Hart of course is a long-time Nike partner. He’s frequently spotted running in marathons wearing their attire, and has his own line of athletic sneakers. He’s no stranger to the tech world either, serving as a vocal partner for smart headphone-maker Muzik.
