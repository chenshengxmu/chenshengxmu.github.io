* Official fixes for both the battery-draining Exchange bug and the potentially dangerous Lock screen vulnerability that lets anyone bypass your passcode are likely to arrive as part of iOS 6.1.2, a maintenance update that should be released for public consumption before month’s end, according to a German blog with a somewhat accurate record of Apple reporting…
* According to the German-language blog iFun, fixes for these vulnerabilities are part of the iOS 6.1.2 software update, said to arrive before next Wednesday, February 20.
* The blog says this information was provided by the same source who predicted the launch of iOS 6.1.1.
* Wenesday came news of a trick which enables anyone to bypass your iPhone’s Lock screen in order to gain access to your contacts, the Phone app, email messages, photos and other data.
* Apple in a prepared statement acknowledged the issue.
* “We are aware of this issue, and will deliver a fix in a future software update,” spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
* Both Microsoft and Apple have also offered up band-aid fixes for a nasty Exchange bug in iOS 6.1.1 which results in the battery draining faster than usual.
* That glitch, iFun writes, will also be addressed in iOS 6.1.2.
