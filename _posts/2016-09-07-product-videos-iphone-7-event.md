* Apple has posted the product videos shown during today’s iPhone 7 event to its YouTube channel. Included in the spots are clips showing off the Apple Watch Series 2, the iPhone 7, and the all-new, wireless, in-ear headphones it’s calling “AirPods.”
* Of course if you missed the keynote this morning, we recommend watching a replay of it in its entirety, or at the very least check out this humorous highlight reel. But for folks who just want to get to the meat of the event, these videos will do the trick.
