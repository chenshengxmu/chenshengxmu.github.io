* Apple’s media events, like the one for the iPhone 5 yesterday, have long been a source of fodder for parodies. They’re both distinct and recognizable, which always makes for easy mockery material.
* CollegeHumor is the latest contributor to the category, as it recently posted a new video called “Apple Coasting Keynote.” In it, a Tim Cook-like character takes the stage and announces…nothing.
* Watch…
* If you recognize the guy in the video, that’s because it’s actor Christopher McDonald. And you probably recognize him from such films as Happy Gilmore and Requiem for a Dream.
* The video itself is pretty funny. I laughed when McDonald started going through his “sleep, family time, and golf” bit — a nod to Steve Jobs, and his epic iPhone keynote back in 2007.
* What did you think of the clip?
