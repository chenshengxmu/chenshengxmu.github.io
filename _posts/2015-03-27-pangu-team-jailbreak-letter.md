* The Pangu Team, which has been responsible for multiple iOS 7 and iOS 8 jailbreaks, posted an open letter to its website on Friday. The letter is entitled “Jailbreak Should not Tolerate Regional Discrimination,” and it talks about discrimination, rumors regarding Pangu, and more.
* It appears much of the motivation behind the post comes from comments made by hacker Stefan Esser, better known as I0n1c. The team says during his talk at this year’s Syscan conference, Esser made several comments that they felt were racist and “full of morbid imaginations.”
* The letter is of course worth reading in full, which you can do here, but we’ve highlighted some of the more interesting tidbits below.
