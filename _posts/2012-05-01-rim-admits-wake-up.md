* Finally, all of the speculation can come to an end. Remember that ridiculous ‘wake up’ flash mob that hit an Australian Apple store a few days ago? Of course you do, we’ve been hearing about it nonstop.
* Well as it turns out, Macworld was right. RIM was behind the whole thing. How do we know? Well, because the BlackBerry-makers just gave a statement to Macworld Australia confirming it…
* “We can confirm that the Australian ‘Wake Up’ campaign, which involves a series of experiential activities taking place across Sydney and Melbourne, was created by RIM Australia. A reveal will take place on May 7th that will aim to provoke conversation on what ‘being in business’ means to Australians.”
* I’m not sure what a company that can’t stop bleeding money or marketshare is doing pulling a stunt like this, but I guess to a certain extent it worked. The story has definitely achieved “viral” status over the past few days.
* Anyways, at least now we can put this whole thing behind us.
* Feel free to leave any final thoughts on the fiasco below.
