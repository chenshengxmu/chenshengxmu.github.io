* DJI pushed a new update to their DJI Go iPhone app today, bringing with it support for the iPhone X. The update also brings minor firmware upgrades to the Spark, and the Phantom 4 Pro.
* The full screen view now works across the app from the login screen to the editor. Of course, streaming from a drone’s camera will still be cropped as it is a different aspect ratio than the iPhone X’s screen. You can see this in the native camera app as well.
* While the actual video or photo does get boxed, the app still takes better advantage of the screen while controlling the drone by offsetting some of the controls over to the edges. This gives you a more unobstructed view of your content.

* There were also minor updates to the Spark (which we reviewed before) as well as the Phantom 4 Pro.
* Spark: – Optimized device connection and activation guide. – Added support when simultaneously downloading firmware updates for both the aircraft and remote controller.
* Phantom 4 Pro: – Added Panorama mode (with v01.05.0300 firmware or later).
* General: – Added compatibility with iPhone X.
* You can download the DJI Go 4 app on the App Store for free. The Spark is available on Amazon for $374, and the Phantom 4 Pro will run you $1375.
