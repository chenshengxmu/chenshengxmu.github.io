* The Dev Team released RedSn0w 0.9.7b1 this morning, an untethered jailbreak for iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4G on iOS 4.2.1. When we first reported about this updated version of RedSn0w, we advised you not to use because it is still in beta, and most importantly, comes with a few issues worth mentioning.
* We still think that you should hold off and be patient. A more stable version should be released soon. In the meanwhile, if you are curious about what problems you might encounter after “untethering” your iPhone, here are some of the issues that have been reported:
* If you rely on an unlock for your iPhone, you should definitely stay away from this untethered jailbreak for the time being.
* What are you going to do? Are you going to use RedSn0w anyways, or do you want to wait for a safer update? If you do give it a try, please make sure to share your experience with us.
