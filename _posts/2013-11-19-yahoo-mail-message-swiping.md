* Yahoo Mail has been making some serious moves lately with a major redesign across the web and mobile apps. On the iOS side, the iPhone and iPad Yahoo Mail app recently saw a major revamp and feature additions, including folder management, multiple account support, native iPad interface and more.
* I’ve been increasingly liking the 16-year-old web-based email service, especially now that every account comes with one terabyte of free storage. The app has been updated yesterday to version 2.0.3 with quite useful message swiping functionality and a few other tweaks…
* Yahoo Mail now lets you swipe left and right when viewing email messages on iPhone. This functionality is also supported in the app’s full-screen mode on iPads.

* In addition to message swiping, changelog for Yahoo Mail version 2.0.3 also lists the usual “bug fixes and stability improvements”.
* You can gran Yahoo Mail free in the App Store.
* The 12.3MB universal binary supports any iDevice running iOS 6.0 or later.
