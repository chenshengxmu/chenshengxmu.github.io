* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared some interesting predictions for 2016 iPhones and iPads in a note sent to clients this morning, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors.
* For starters, Kuo is adamant that the third-generation iPad Air will be arriving in the first half of next year. The tablet won’t be outfitted with a pressure-sensing screen due to alleged production issues related to building a 9.7-inch 3D Touch sensor array.
* For the time being, 3D Touch remains “one of the most severe production bottlenecks in iPhone 6s supply chain,“ the analyst wrote.
* As for Apple’s iPhone 7, Kuo expects the smartphone to arrive around the September timeframe with 3D Touch that should have “similar technology and structure” as the iPhone 6s.
* Although fans were expecting the third-generation iPad Air at Apple’s fall event this year, the company instead unveiled the iPad Pro with Apple Pencil and the fourth-generation iPad mini.
* Truth be told, the current-generation iPad Air 2, which is now more than a year old, continues to benefit from the speedy A8X chip with two gigabytes of RAM, twice as much as the previous models.
* iOS 9’s Split View and Slide Over multitasking modes work without a hiccup and most graphics-intensive games deliver console-grade graphics on the iPad Air 2.
* Should Apple entice existing iPad Air 2 owners to upgrade to the iPad Air 3, it better offer a substantial speed increase and some compelling new hardware features. In its current form, the iPad Air 2 is more than capable of supporting existing App Store applications, games and iOS 9 features.
