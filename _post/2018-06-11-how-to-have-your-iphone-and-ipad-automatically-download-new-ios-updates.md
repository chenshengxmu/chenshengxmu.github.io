* To ensure your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch are up to date, turn on an Automatic Updates option to have the latest version of the iOS software download automatically when available.
* This handy new option was introduced in iOS 12.
* Turning Automatic Updates on ensures that your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch is always running the latest commercially available version of the iOS software.
* Running the latest iOS edition helps protect your devices from malware and any known exploits that would put your private data at risk of being hijacked by malicious apps.
* TUTORIAL: Disabling automatic software updates on Apple TV
* On the other hand, Apple typically closes the signing window for older iOS releases within weeks of a major iOS software update release, meaning power users might want to refrain from using this option and instead decide for themselves when they would like to upgrade.
* Automatic Updates for iOS releases is a feature that requires the iOS 12 software, so keep that in mind. Also important, this option is managed separately on every iOS device you own.
* The option is off by default, here’s how to enable it:
* 1) Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 12 or newer.
* 2) Tap General.
* 3) Tap Software Update.
* 4) Tap Automatic Updates.
* 5) Slide the switch labeled Automatic Updates to the ON position.

* When this option has been enabled, you should see a confirmation message on the previous screen saying the device will automatically install iOS software updates.
* Now your iPhone and iPad will automatically download any new iOS software updates when they become available. You’ll need to get past the changelog screen and accept Apple’s various terms and agreements before the download actually installs itself on the device.
* TUTORIAL: Stopping your HomePod from installing new software automatically
* You can, of course, still check for updates manually in Settings or schedule a new iOS software update to install overnight. When new iOS software is available to download,  you’ll see a notification on your Lock screen and a badge on the Settings app icon, just like before.
* Don’t be concerned about your cellular data because iOS software updates only download over Wi-Fi and when your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch is connected to power.
* Existing settings let you separately control Automatic Downloads for your apps and media.
* The relevant toggles are found in Settings → iTunes & App Stores:
* The above settings, on by default, apply to free apps and media as well.
* TIP: Ensuring your Mac is receiving new malware definitions
* Automatic Downloads for your favorite podcasts can be adjusted in your Podcast app settings.
