* Apple enthusiast Thomas Park has put together an incredibly thorough catalogue of Apple’s 357 retail stores from around the world. In his gallery of storefront photos, Park has collected a picture of nearly every Apple Store in existence and assembled them all on one scrollable website.
* His catalogue shows the evolution of Apple’s retail designs throughout the years, beginning with the first Apple Store in Tyson’s Corner, Virginia in August of 2001.
* After scrolling through the pictures, you’ll notice that many of the storefronts haven’t changed at all since they were originally opened. Apple frequently renovates and changes the interior of its stores, however. While a few stores are missing, nearly all locations are present in the gallery. The stores get increasingly more impressive as time goes on.
* From Thomas Park’s blog:
* At the time, most analysts considered Apple’s fledgling retail initiative to be doomed. But though Tysons Corner seemed like a modest start, it was a blueprint for big things to come. 357 stores and counting later, Apple is tops in sales per square foot, and they did it by applying many of the same principles as they do to their products: natural materials, understated aesthetics, and daringly innovative processes.
* Anyway, one thing I wanted to do was go back and see how Apple storefronts have evolved over the past decade. I couldn’t find anywhere to do this easily, so I decided to create a gallery myself.
* You can scroll through all the images or filter stores by county.
* Apple reported $3.5 billion in revenue from Apple Stores during its last earnings call. Apple is widely considered to have the most profitable retail division in the world.
