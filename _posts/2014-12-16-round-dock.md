* Interested in rounding off the look of your iPhone’s dock? If so, there’s a new jailbreak tweak that you should check out, which is aptly entitled RoundDock. RoundDock is a brand new jailbreak tweak available on the BigBoss repo that will round the corners of your Home screen dock at the bottom of the SpringBoard.
* RoundDock is a super simple tweak that works on both iOS 7 and iOS 8. After installation, there are no options to configure, and no settings to adjust. RoundDock also works without needing a theming platform like WinterBoard. Just install it, and you’ll see the results of RoundDock on your SpringBoard immediately.
* Although RoundDock provides no functional bonuses over the stock iOS dock, some may prefer its curvier look over the standard dock. If you’d like to try RoundDock, you can find it free of charge on the BigBoss repo.
