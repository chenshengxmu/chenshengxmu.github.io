* Apparently, Sunday isnâ€™t exactly Funday after all. Contray to popular belief, the iOS 6 untethered jailbreak will be released tomorrow (Monday), instead of Sunday. The evad3rs team just sent out a tweet confirming it.
* In the meantime, evasi0n.com shows a status of 90% complete. All thatâ€™s left to do now is to perform final tests and preparation.

* So there you have it. An absolute confirmed release date for the iOS 6 jailbreak. I do believe that they intended to make Sunday the targeted release date, but if itâ€™s not finished, itâ€™s not finished. No need to rush out something thatâ€™s full of bugs. Tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, you will liberate your iDevices. For now? Enjoy the Super Bowl.
* Update:
* Yes, as some readers have noted, the status seems to be slightly changing. After a refresh, I see 91%:

* Not that it really matters much anymore. What does matter is that we will be seeing a jailbreak on Monday.
* Planetbeing states that tomorrowâ€™s release date is concrete:
* Yes, tomorrow is a concrete release date. Itâ€™s also the only release date weâ€™ve ever given. ðŸ˜›

* Get some rest, tomorrow is going to a day to remember.
