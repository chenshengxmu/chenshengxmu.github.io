* Paper, a new productivity app from cloud storage experts over at Dropbox, launched in public beta in the United States a month ago. After a slight delay, Paper is now available to customers in the European Union. With the free Paper app (not to be confused with Facebook’s experimental Paper app), you can collaborate on projects, get updates, make edits and respond to feedback right from your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* Updates, changes or your feedback automatically sync with your docs on paper.dropbox.com. Other noteworthy features include enhanced tables and image galleries, notifications across desktop, mobile and web, advanced search features and more.
* It even organizes notifications for comments, shares and @mentions in a single list.
* You can add, view and reply to comments, star docs to pin them to the top of your lists, easily invite others from your team to collaborate on your documents and so forth.
* Customers in the U.S. and the EU can grab Paper at no charge from the App Store.
