* Wednesday morning, Electronic Arts’ Real Racing 3 for the iPhone and iPad has received another Lamborghini-themed update bringing out several new features, cars, tracks and other content, including classic Lamborghinis such as the limited-edition Miura and the legendary Countach.
* Fans of multiplayer gaming should appreciate that the free-to-play game has introduced a new eight-player, cross-platform multiplayer mode with real-time racing and drafting.
* Jump past the fold to learn about other enhancements in this update.
* I’m loving replays with TV-style aerial and wheel cameras, as well as a revamped and decluttered main menu with way better navigation. The racing school is nice, too, allowing you to practice drifts, improve driving skills and even win a free BMW Z4 sDrive351s.
* Real Racing 3 2.6 changelog:
* The previous update has enabled a Speedrush TV mode tasking you with landing a job driving dangerously for a TV commercial.
* Some North American and Japanese players have been able to play the latest update early, which may cause problems for folks who are currently competing in the Speedrush TV challenge.
* Developer Firemonkey advises against updating until they’ve sorted out the issue.
* Real Racing 3 is available free of charge and includes In-App Purchases.
* The 1.29-gigabyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 5.1.1 or later, including all iPhones from the iPhone 4 onward.
* [App Store]
