* By now, most of you have heard Steve Jobs’ infamous “war on Android” quote from his recently-released biography. It goes something like, “I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.”
* He wasn’t kidding. The latest estimates suggest that Apple’s litigation fees its incurred in its ongoing legal battles with Android manufacturers add up to more than $100 million dollars. And the war is far from over…
* Newsweek contributor Dan Lyons reported the staggering number this morning on his personal blog, citing a person familiar with the situation:
* “But a person close to the situation tells me there’s a rumor going around among the lawyers that Apple spent $100 million just on its first set of claims against HTC. Who knows if it’s true, but if so, Apple didn’t get a lot for its money.”
* For the most part, Lyons is correct. Although Apple has won a number of court victories over the past two years, including multiple injunctions against Samsung in Europe and Australia, they’ve yielded little results in the grand scheme of things.
* As expensive as lawyers are individually, it’s not hard to imagine that Apple’s crack team of litigators cost a fortune. And if its efforts against HTC are running in the neighborhood of $100 million dollars, you have to wonder what Apple has spent on its entire endeavor.
* Has it been worth it?
