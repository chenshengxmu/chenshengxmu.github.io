* Tumblr users will be happy to hear that the micro-blogging service has posted a new update for its iOS client. The update, which brings the app to version 3.4, includes a handful of very useful enhancements.
* And all of these enhancements have to do with search and discovery. Users can now search for specific tags and blogs, or explore various trending tags and blogs, right from within the mobile Tumblr application…
* Here’s your 3.4 change log:
* We’re thrilled to bring you a brand new discovery experience:
* – Search tags and blogs – Explore trending tags and blogs – Follow recommended blogs for any tag you search
* In my opinion, search on the Tumblr app has always been good for general topic. But it was difficult to filter out all of the noise and zero in on a specific blog or tag. Obviously, the new 3.4 change log changes that.
* There’s also now a launch page filled with currently trending blogs and tags, which I think makes it much easier to see what’s hot on Tumblr—a service that currently supports more than 50 million active members.
* I’ve always thought the Tumblr app was pretty solid, and it’s gotten even better over the last few updates. I’m running out of complaints. It’s a must-have if you use the service, and you can find it in the App Store for free.
