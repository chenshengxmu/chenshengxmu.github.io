* Another week, and that can only mean one or two things; you just got paid, and/or it’s time for another episode of Ask Jeff.
* As always, this is the show where you the viewers get to ask the questions, and I do my best to provide some decent answers.
* On this week’s docket, we tackle Apple fanboys, compare Android devices to the iPhone, queuing in line for the iPhone 5, and chit-chat about some of my favorite jailbreak apps. If you have a question that you’re just dying to get answered, step right up…
* Was your question answered this time around? If so, congrats! If not, then by all means, ask again.
* Let me know what you think about this week’s episode in the comments below.
