* Finally, after nearly a month of silence, Apple has seeded the 3rd beta of iOS 5.1 to developers. As you may recall, the company pushed out beta 2 all the way back on December 12th of last year.
* As several other sites are noting, the update only seems to be available via OTA (over-the-air) for previous iOS 5.1 users, but it should be available from Apple’s regular developer portal shortly…
* Judging by the screen grabs we’ve seen, beta 3 doesn’t seem to be too exciting. Its brief changelog states that the update just “contains bug fixes and improvements.” But we’re not writing it off just yet.
* Folks digging through iOS 5.1’s source code have already uncovered a number of interesting things, including evidence that Apple may be close to releasing devices with quad-core processors. So stay tuned.
* Be sure to let us know if you discover anything cool in beta 3, and we’ll do the same.
