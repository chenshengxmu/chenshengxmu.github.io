* The Dock is a special part of the Home screen that houses your favorite apps and appears on all pages except for the Today page, which is where your widgets appear. On the other hand, if you wanted to change that, you officially can.
* A new free jailbreak tweak dubbed ViewDockOnTodayView by CydiaGeek allows the Dock appear on the Today page with all of your widgets and in addition to all of your regular Home screen pages.
* Whether or not there’s a functional benefit to adding the Dock to the Today page remains to be seen, but the tweak certainly does make things feel more consistent as you scroll between your Home screen pages and into the Today page.
* Worthy of note, the Dock only appears from the Home screen-based Today page; you won’t see your Dock when looking at the Today page via the Lock screen or in Notification Center, so fortunately you won’t get additional unwanted clutter anywhere else in iOS.
* ViewDockOnTodayView adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where there are a couple of options you can play with:

* Here, you can toggle the tweak on or off and hide the separator line and page dots that normally appear at the bottom of the Today page to prevent them from clashing with the Dock while it’s showing.
* For the most part, ViewDockOnTodayView is a proof of concept jailbreak tweak, offering functionality that you don’t really ‘need,’ but might want instead. It works great in tandem with Springtomize 4, which lets you have a custom number of apps in the Dock at one given time in addition to various other features.
* If you’re interested in giving ViewDockOnTodayView a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices only.
