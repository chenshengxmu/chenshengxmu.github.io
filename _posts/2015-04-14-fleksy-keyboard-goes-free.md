* Fleksy Keyboard, one of the first and most popular software keyboards for iOS 8 devices, has gone free for a week. The app usually retails for 99 cents a pop and has never gone free since its App Store debut as an iOS 8-compatible downloadable software keyboard in September of last year.
* In addition, Fleksy’s latest update has rechristened the app as ‘Fleksy + GiF Keyboard’ to reflect its newly gained integration with Riffsy’s GIF Keyboard for iOS. The resulting app now gives you access to millions of GIFs on top of Fleksy’s existing emoji support and perks like advanced keyboard capabilities with gestures and much more.
* Now when you type in apps with Fleksy Keyboard, you can use GIFs from Riffsy and Fleksy’s emoji, all in one place. With this change in place, Fleksy let you share “highly expressive content” across iMessage, SMS, Twitter, email and Facebook.
* The ability to send GIFs is available right from within the main Fleksy keyboard. From there, you can access other features of Riffsy’s GIF Keyboard such as GIF categories, search, trending GIFs and more.
* Riffsy’s GIF Keyboard is available free in the App Store.
* “All this is made possible thanks to the new features of iOS 8 and the great GIF support that the Apple platform has offered,” developers noted.
