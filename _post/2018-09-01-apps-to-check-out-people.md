* Chords are amazing. But for beginning musicians, and even talented ones that don’t read sheet music, they can be tough to find. That’s where Tonic comes in. Using augmented reality, the app lets you easily view over 130 chords on your own piano. It tells you exactly where to place your fingers to play almost any chord with flat/sharp display modes and 3 octaves to choose from.

* The only way to truly understand something is to experience it. That’s the premise behind Workshop, an app that allows you to learn a new skill by following along with a mentor as you go hands-on. No lectures. No books. No homework. Just you learning how to do things like making your own flatbread from scratch by actually doing it. Classes are free to try, but you’ll have to pay for full courses.

Take a good look at each picture and remember as many details as you can. Features include over 1000 face combinations and progress tracking so you can actually see your memory getting better.
