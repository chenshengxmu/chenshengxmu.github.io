* A new video has surfaced Thursday, purportedly depicting an all-aluminum back of a forthcoming 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model.
* This follows yesterday’s video which compared a 5.5-inch iPhone 6 dummy to several jumbo-sized Android phones and last week’s photos of an alleged 5.5-inch iPhone 6 display panel.
* The back part shown off in today’s video appears genuine although one can’t tell for sure whether it represents a finalized design that’s about to go into production or if it’s one of the early prototypes that Apple may or may not have abandoned…
* The video was reposted from the rather accurate Japanese website Macotakara by French blog NowhereElse.fr [Google translate].
* Here it is.
* I for one am certainly glad that we’re finally starting seeing genuine-looking parts made of metal, as opposed to an avalanche of unconvincing 3D-printed plasticky dummies.

* The part is said to have been sourced from Australia-based MacFixIt, indicating Apple’s suppliers must have started ramping up production of the handset. Last year, the same source leaked several plastic parts belonging to the iPhone 5c which have proved genuine.

* It appears to have been designed to support a bigger 4.7-inch panel and features a slightly revised internal layout, indicating minor changes to the design of internal components such as the printed circuit board, the battery, supporting chips and more.

* So, what do you guys make of this?
* If this part is genuine, what’s your take on the design tweaks Apple’s made to the next iPhone’s exterior? Do you like the changes or not?
