* Just ahead of WWDC 2016, which kicks of with a keynote presentation on Monday, June 13, at 10am, Apple issues a timely refresh to its official WWDC app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* The refreshed app has an all-new dark interface and now runs on the fourth-generation Apple TV so you can watch WWDC action from the comfort of your couch.
* “A tvOS version of this app is now available, so you can stream and download videos from WWDC 2016 and previous conferences on Apple TV,” writes the company in release notes accompanying the free of charge download.

* WWDC for iOS is a free download from the App Store.
