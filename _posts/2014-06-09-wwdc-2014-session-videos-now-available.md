Even if Apple had a larger venue, it has become increasingly difficult to secure a WWDC ticket in the first place over the past few years. This time around, Apple implemented a lottery system to determine how the tickets would be dispersed.

* To watch the streaming videos on the web, you need to be using Safari on a Mac running OS X Lion or later. You can also watch the videos through the official WWDC app for iPhone and iPad. Alternatively, each video can be downloaded in SD or HD format. There are accompanying PDF documents available that contain all of the slides shown in each session.
* Apple has also made its full-length WWDC keynote available for streaming through its website, in addition to posting the two-hour video on YouTube and making it available for download on iTunes. After downloading the keynote, it can be watched on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or other devices. WWDC 2014 was centered upon the unveiling of iOS 8, OS X Yosemite and new developer tools.
