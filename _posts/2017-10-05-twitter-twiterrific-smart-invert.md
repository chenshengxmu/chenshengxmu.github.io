* iOS 11’s Smart Invert, which reverts the colors of the display while attempting to leave the colors of images and media intact, has been gaining some much-needed support from popular apps.
* Recently, Twitter for iPhone and iPad was updated with support for Smart Invert, meaning media you see in the app is no longer inverted when this feature is enabled. Another popular Twitter client, Twitterrific for iOS, today gained support for iOS 11’s Smart Invert.

* Smart Invert in the Twitter app, above, and the Twitterrific app, top of post.
* Like with Twitter, it prevents the images in Twitterrific from being inverted when Smart Invert is on. To try it out, update your copy of Twitter or Twitterrific to the latest version, then toggle Smart Invert on in Settings → General → Accessibility → Display Accommodations → Invert Colors.

* Apple’s description states that Smart Invert “reverses the colors of the display, except for images, media and some apps that use dark color styles.” In practice, however, Smart Invert is a hit and miss because iOS can’t always identify media assets in third-party apps.
* Thankfully, Apple gave developers new APIs to address this problem. Apps that take advantage of these APIs can simply tell the operating system, “here are the media assets I use that you shouldn’t touch when the user enables Smart Invert”.

* I always read release notes when my apps get updated to see if they’ve implemented support for this cool mode and I suggest you do the same if you care about Smart Invert.
* While Smart Invert is by no means a true substitute for the oft-requested Dark Mode in iOS, it’s the closest thing to Dark Mode you can currently get on iOS unless, of course, you’re jailbroken.
* You can download Twitter and Twitterrific for free in App Store.
