* When I wrote about my disappointing 3 hour wait in line for an iPad 2 I knew my time was low. But I had no idea how microscopic it was compared to other Apple fanatics.
* The iPad 2 went on sale in 25 countries around the world yesterday and the amount of people that turned out was astonishing. BGR is reporting that people were waiting as long as 53 hours prior to yesterday’s launch in Sydney, Australia.
* In addition, similar lines were reported across the globe including Germany, The Netherlands, and Canada. In fact, a BGR reader sent in a video of one of the lines at Toronto Eaton Centre in Canada, at around 9:30 a.m. yesterday.
* Those who remember the U.S. iPad 2 launch will recall that they did not go on sale until 5:00 p.m. We posted the video below and it’s really worth watching, I couldn’t believe how far back the line went. It’s at least worth watching through the first minute ;p.
* How long did you wait in line for your iPad 2? Tell us below!
