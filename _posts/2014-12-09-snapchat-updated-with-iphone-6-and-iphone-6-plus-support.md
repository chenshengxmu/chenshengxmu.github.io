* Popular photo messaging app Snapchat was updated tonight with a few features, the most important one probably being support for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This update, which brings Snapchat to version 8.1.0, also brings about improved captions and the ability to stack filters on top of each other.
* Of course, support for iPhone 6 is the headlining feature of this update. Say goodbye to that bloated user interface and fat keyboard that looks like it doesnâ€™t belong! The changelog notes that users can now change the color of text captions, pinch to resize them, and drag them around the screen. Additionally, you can now press and hold after adding a filter to add another one.
* Snapchat is available for free in the App Store.
