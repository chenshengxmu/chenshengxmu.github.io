* We’re following along live with Apple’s Chicago education event, where Apple VP Greg Joswiak just announced a new version of the company’s tablet. The refreshed iPad features a 9.7-inch display, Touch ID Home button and support for Apple’s Pencil stylus.
* The new slate looks very similar to the current budget iPad. Apple says it has 10 hour battery life, 8MP rear camera, HD FaceTime camera, A10 Fusion chip, GPS, a compass, and of course an LTE option. It also supports same tilt and pressure sensing as the iPad Pro.

* Additionally, Joswiak spent a lot of stage time going over new iPad apps and updates. The screenshot seen above is of Froggipedia, and augmented reality app that allows you to dissect virtual frogs. Apple also has iWork updates on the way with proper Pencil support.
* Here’s a nice summary quote from Jos:
* “iPad is our vision for the future of computing and hundreds of millions of people around the world use it every day at work, in school and for play. This new 9.7-inch iPad takes everything people love about our most popular iPad and makes it even better for inspiring creativity and learning,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of Product Marketing. “Our most popular and affordable iPad now includes support for Apple Pencil, bringing the advanced capabilities of one of our most creative tools to even more users. This iPad also has the power of the A10 Fusion chip, combined with the big, beautiful Retina display, advanced cameras and sensors that enable incredible AR experiences simply not possible on other devices.”
* The new iPad is available starting today, begins shipping this week, and the price starts at $329. Schools will be able to purchase the tablet starting at $299 (similar to current education pricing). Apple will also be offering a $10 discount on Apple Pencil for students.
