title: How to enable Notification Center on the Lock screen for free - Updated

* There are already multiple ways to enable iOS 5’s Notification Center on your iOS device’s Lock screen; IntelliScreenX and Bulletin come to mind.
* But what if you wanted a free way to enable Lock screen Notification Center? Then you’d want to try Notiflock…
* Notiflock features no settings or app icons, all you do is install it and start using Notification Center from the Lock screen.
* For some reason or another, Notiflock has disappeared from Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it once called home.
* In the meantime, you can download Notiflock using this download link. You will need to install the deb file with iFile, or by manual means from a terminal.
* What do you think about Notiflock?
* Update: So it turns out that this was removed from Cydia because it was stolen code from Bulletin. Hence, we are removing the download link. Sorry.
