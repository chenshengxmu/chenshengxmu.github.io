* It’s no secret that we at iDB love us some Tweetbot. In fact, I think Alex gave it its most glowing review to date.
* Despite the positive response from us and the public in general, the app does have some opportunities for improvement in a few basic areas.
* The first noticeably lacking option is landscape mode. That’s right, there’s no built in landscape mode to speak of just yet.
* Secondly, the ability to tweet out messages longer than the stock 140 characters is nowhere to be found as well.
* For those of you who love Tweetbot, but are at odds with these glaring omissions, jailbreak developer Filippo Bigarella has provided two worthwhile solutions…
* The first and perhaps most obvious feature missing from Tweetbot is landscape mode. How this was able to slide under the radar is anyone’s guess; maybe it was for aesthetic reasons.
* Regardless of the reasoning, it’s silly to release a Twitter client that lacks landscape mode.
* TweetbotRotator — a jailbreak tweak available on Cydia brings landscape mode into the picture, and it works completely as advertised.

* The next omission to be fixed by means of a nifty jailbreak tweak is Twitlonger functionality i.e. being able to send tweets longer than 140 characters.
* Right now, if you try to send a message longer than 140 characters via Tweetbot, you simply can’t; now you have options.
* PastieBot is a companion tweak that automatically posts your entire message to Pastie.org, even if it’s longer than 140 characters. It works very similarly to Twitlonger, and other tweet-lengthening services.

* What’s nice about both of these tweaks is that they’re from the same developer; therefore, they work together with no issues.
* With the recent add-ons released on Cydia, it’s probable that even if Tweetbot isn’t satisfactory out of the box, you’ll enjoy it more with the help of the jailbreak community.
* Both PastieBot and TweetbotRotator are free downloads for jailbroken iPhones on the Cydia store. You will need to add the iSpazio repo for both: http://repo.ispazio.net
* Are you still a big fan of Tweetbot since its initial release, or have you gone back to your previous Twitter client?
