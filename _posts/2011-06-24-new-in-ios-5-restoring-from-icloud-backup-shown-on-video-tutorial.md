* One of the most beneficial features of the new iOS 5 is the ability to restore directly from iCloud backup via Wi-Fi.
* Upgrading from iOS 5 beta 1 to iOS 5 beta 2 was a painless process thanks to the amazing restoral from iCloud backup. It literally only took a few taps before all of my settings and apps were restored like they were prior to upgrade.
* The restoral is so thorough that it’ll even pick up any website you were previously visiting! Check out the full video walkthrough of the iCloud restoral process inside…
* When you go through the device’s initial setup process, you’ll be prompted right there on the spot to restore from iCloud backup.
* It works very much in the same way as a normal iTunes restore would, except of course there’s no cable’s involved.
* What do you think about Apple’s new PC Free strategy? Will you be taking advantage of iCloud’s many benefits?
