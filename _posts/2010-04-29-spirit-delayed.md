* I don’t know if it’s just a bad joke but Comex, the developer behing the userland jailbreak Spirit, just said on Twitter that he was delaying the release of this new jailbreak.
* This decision came after Comex read a year old article about how quick Apple was at patching a security hole in firmware 3.0.
* If true, this piece of news is a a huge let down. Everyone was really waiting for Spirit to be released. I fail to understand the logic behind this decision. Whatever date the jailbreak will be released, there will always be the risk of Apple patching the firmware at some point.
* Cross your fingers! Maybe Comex is just playing with our nerves… How do you feel about that?
