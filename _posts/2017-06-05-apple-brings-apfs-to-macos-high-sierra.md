* Apple is bringing its renowned Apple Filesystem (APFS) to the macOS platform for the first time with the newly-announced macOS High Sierra operating system for Macs.
* APFS first debuted in iOS 10.3 to replace the dated HFS, and the speed improvements were quickly noticed by users.
* APFS will optimize Mac speed and efficiency on both economy and high-end platforms, enabling the hardware to reach new heights in performance; especially those with solid state drives instead of hard disk drives.
* APFS is designed to make transferring files from one place to another faster. Whether you’re transferring files to an external device or to another folder on your Mac, the speed differences will be noticeable.
* In addition to performance improvements, APFS arguably has better security too. This means you an have more peace of mind in transferring files from device to device.
* With APFS becoming the standard on all Apple platforms, Apple‘s mobile and desktop operating systems will soon have an even further unified experience than we already have.
