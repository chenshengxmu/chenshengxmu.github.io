* There are several ways to add ringtones to your iPhone for free. Audiko is one of my favorite but it seems it’s going to get some fierce competition from a new app called AnyRing.
* With AnyRing (3.2) you can easily select any song on your iPhone (or Record you own voice) to play as a Ringtone or SMS Ring. AnyRing even lets you select the starting/ending point in the song to play when the Ringtone is played. Does not require any audio conversion of any type!
* Here are some of the features:
* AnyRing is available from the Cydia Store. It comes with a 10-day trial so you may want to try it out first, and if you like it, you can choose to pay the $3.99.
* I think it’s worth the price. What do you think?
