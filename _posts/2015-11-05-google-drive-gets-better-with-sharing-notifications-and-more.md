* Google has updated its Drive cloud storage client for iOS with mobile notifications when files or folders are shared, or when someone requests access to a file you own.
* The change allows for a more consistent sharing experience across platforms and includes enhancements such as jumping directly to a shared file by tapping on the notification banner and providing a custom message when sharing a file or folder with others.
* If you grab a link to a file or a folder and share it before you’ve granted access, your recipients will be now able to request access with a single tap. Previously, the person receiving a link to a file the you haven’t granted access to yet was unable to open it.
* In addition to these changes, iOS users can now take advantage of reverse sorting by file name and date and playing audio files directly in the Drive app.
* Google Drive requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Arabic, Bokmål, Norwegian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
* Grab Google Drive at no charge in the App Store.
