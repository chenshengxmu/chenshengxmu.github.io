title: The iOS 86 theme in action
---
* A few weeks ago we brought you info on how to get the iOS 86 WinterBoard theme for the iPhone.
* I think it’s safe to say that the reaction to the theme was mixed, but perhaps that may change once you see it in action.
* iOS 86 brings you a cell shaded looking theme similar to the classic Dreamcast game Jet Set Radio. Be sure to check out our previous coverage on iOS 86 if you’re interested in trying it yourself.
