* Not to be confused with the Mission Control that’s standard on all OS X Lion builds, MissionControl is a Cydia tweak that adds menu based multitasking to the iPhone.
* Using Activator as a means to invoke the menu, MissionControl is a simple alternative for those who want lots of predefined options in an organized menu.
* This free tweak contains quick links to Cydia, Twitter, Facebook, Wi-Fi settings, and more…
* Since it uses Activator, MissionControl’s menu can be accessed from anywhere with a quick gesture. It would be nice if the developer added the ability to customize or rearrange the menus, but perhaps they’re saving that function for future updates.
* Have you used MissionControl? If so, how do you like it?
