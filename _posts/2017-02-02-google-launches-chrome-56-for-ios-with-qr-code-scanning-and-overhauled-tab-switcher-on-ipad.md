* Google today updated Chrome for iPhone and iPad on App Store with a pair of new features. The first allows you to scan a QR code or barcode by selecting a new Scan QR Code option in the shortcuts menu after pressing the app’s Home screen icon with 3D Touch on iPhone 6s/7 series. On older devices without 3D Touch, search for “QR” in iOS’s Spotlight feature to reveal a shortcut to the browser’s new barcode-scanning function.
* As for the other feature, Google says it’s overhauled the tab switcher layout on iPad to make it easier to access your open websites.
* QR codes and barcodes are being increasingly used as a marketing tool.
* Companies often infuse these codes with URLs that lead to ad campaigns, special product promotions and other data. As iOS does not support barcode-scanning via the Camera app yet, iPhone users are required to use third-party apps that support scanning of barcodes, like Scanbot for example.
* With today’s Chrome update, you no longer have to download extra apps as the browser can now handle QR codes and barcodes and will automatically display any webpages that might be embedded in these codes.
* Earlier this month, the search giant announced that the source code for Chrome for iOS is now available on an open-source basis. Just last week, Google released Chrome 56 for Mac with various performance enhancements and lower power consumption.
* Chrome for iOS is available free on App Store.
