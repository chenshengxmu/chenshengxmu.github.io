* Developer Aspyr Media announced yesterday that Sid Meier’s Civilization VI for Mac is now available on Steam, just three days after its PC release. The game will be hitting the Mac App Store at a later stage, Aspyr has confirmed. Civilization VI was created by the same team that made Civilization expansions.
* The turn-based strategy game challenges you to dominate capitals and woo the world as the new diplomatic leader with improvements like a new research system, enhanced artificial intelligence and more.
* According to Aspyr:
* Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now physically expand across the map, active research in technology and culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five ways to achieve victory in the game.
* The game does not support Metal for Mac, Apple’s low-overhead API for accessing the GPU and accelerating graphics-intensive apps and games.
* Speaking of graphics, the game supports GPUs from NVIDIA (GeForce 650M, 675MX, 680MX, 750M and 755M), ATI (Radeon HD 5750, HD 5770, HD 5870, HD 6750 and HD 6770) and integrated Intel HD graphics (4000, 5000, 5300, 6000, IRIS and 515)
* Other minimum system requirements include:
* Steam Controller is supported, too.
* Here’s the official launch trailer.
* Check out some of the highlights:
* EXPANSIVE EMPIRES: See the marvels of your empire spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain.
* ACTIVE RESEARCH: Unlock boosts that speed your civilization’s progress through history. To advance more quickly, use your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover new cultures.
* DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY: Interactions with other civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations.
* COMBINED ARMS: Expanding on the “one unit per tile” design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar units can also be combined to form powerful “Corps” units.
* ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER: In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session.
* Asypr is currently finalizing a Mac App Store edition of the game, but wouldn’t commit to a launch date at this stage. Both the Steam edition and the forthcoming Mac App Store edition of Civilization VI are priced at $59.99.
* The Anniversary Limited Edition of Civilization VI for Mac is available for order through Amazon, GameStop and other retailers. Downloadable content for Civilization VI includes four post-launch packs that are part of the Digital Deluxe Edition adding new maps, scenarios, civilizations and leaders for a bundled discount.
