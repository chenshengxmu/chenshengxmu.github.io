* We recently showed you a tweak that can remove Spotlight search from your device entirely. On the other hand, if you do use Spotlight, but just wish there was more you could do with it to make the interface look better, then try this on for size…
* A new free jailbreak tweak called No Spotlight BG Mask by Justin Petkovic is a minor aesthetic mod that simplifies the way your Spotlight search results look. It removes the background masks that normally appear out of the box, resulting in a new look.
* Shown above, you can see exactly what gets removed after you install the tweak. The end result is a UI that isn’t so busy to the eyes. In my opinion, content seems to look more organized without the mask effect.
* After installation, No Spotlight BG Mask adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand:

* A respring button is included so you can append your changes.
* No Spotlight BG Mask’s effects on your device are purely aesthetic, so there won’t be any differences to the way your Spotlight search results are presented to you.
* If you’re interested in trying No Spotlight BG Mask to see if you like how the end result looks, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now. The tweak is designed to work on both jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices.
