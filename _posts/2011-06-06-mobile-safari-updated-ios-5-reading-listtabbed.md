* iOS 5 will have a new and improved version of Mobile Safari that sports tabbed browsing across all iDevices. Alongside that, Safari also has a new feature called “Reading List” that acts as an Instapaper or Read It Later replacement.
* If you sign in on one device, your browsing information and tabs will be transferred across devices. 
* iOS 5 brings even more web-browsing features to iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Safari Reader displays web articles sans ads or clutter so you can read without distractions. Reading List lets you save interesting articles to peruse later, while iCloud keeps your list updated across all your devices. On iPad, tabbed browsing helps you keep track of multiple web pages and switch between them with ease. And iOS 5 improves Safari performance on all your iOS devices.

* Cool, huh? Who’s ditching Instapaper? Reading List will most likely only work in Mobile Safari.
