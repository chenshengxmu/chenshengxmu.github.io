* A three-judge panel was actually wrong to toss out of the window the $119.6 million verdict in a longstanding lawsuit that involves Apple’s patented slide-to-unlock gesture that the iPhone maker had sued Samsung over a few years back.
* As Bloomberg reports, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has now ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased “based on any intentional infringement by Samsung.”
* “Apple Inc. won an appeals court ruling that reinstates a patent-infringement verdict it won against Samsung Electronics Co., including for its slide-to-unlock feature for smartphones and tablets,” the news gathering organization reported Friday.
* A week from today, the United States Supreme Court will consider a second Apple-Samsung case in an effort to determine just how much the South Korean conglomerate should pay the Cupertino firm for copying patented iPhone designs in its Galaxy-series flagship smartphones.
