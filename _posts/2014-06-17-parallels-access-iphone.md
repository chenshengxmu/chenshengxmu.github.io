* Parallels Access was released last August as an iPad-only application allowing users of the popular desktop virtualization software Parallels to access remote computers on their Apple tablet.
* It instantly became indispensable to mobile warriors who want to run Mac or Windows apps remotely and need to access desktop files and documents wherever they are.
* Today, the free Parallels Access app has been updated with native support for the iPhone and iPod touch so users can now access their desktop on the go and use their PC and Mac applications in full-screen mode like they were made for their handset…
* Parallels says that the refreshed software brings out support for Android phones and tablets as well, in addition to the newly added iPhone support.
* New features make for an even better remote experience while the new Parallels Access for Business lets companies centrally assign, manage, and secure remote access to their computers.
* Parallels Access 2.0 can use an iOS device’s microphone as if it were your desktop’s and includes a Springboard-like app launcher for choosing desktop apps, a Finder-like interface for remote file browsing and swipe-based navigation between apps with custom touch controls.

* You’ll also appreciate the ability to change the screen resolution and wake a remote computer from sleep mode via LAN and much more.
* Jack Zubarev, president of Parallels, said:
* While traditional remote desktop products are trying to show a large desktop on a small mobile device, we worked hard to make remote access from mobile devices a truly simple and effective experience.
* Here’s a quick video tour.
