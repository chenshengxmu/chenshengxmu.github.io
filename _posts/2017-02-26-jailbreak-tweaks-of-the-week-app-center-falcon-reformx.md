* It’s been pretty busy in the jailbreak community these last couple of weeks, mostly due to the release of the Yalu iOS 10 jailbreak just a few weeks ago, but no one around here is complaining about that!
* In this roundup, we’ll be summarizing all of the jailbreak tweaks that we showed you this week, just in case you think you might have missed anything important. We’ll start with our favorites and then move on to the rest afterwards.
* App Center – $3.99

* App Center is fun new jailbreak tweak that adds running apps into their own individual pages of Control Center.
* It utilizes up to nine of your recently-used apps and lets you use them in windowed mode so you can easily swipe between them for faster app multitasking.
* To learn more about how the tweak works, we highly suggest reading our full review to see all of its features.
* Falcon – $1.49

* Falcon adds a number of new features to your Lock screen and to Notification Center by way of additional pages.
* Among the things it can add are a page for toggles, a page for web browsing, and a page for jotting down quick notes. You can even secure your toggles with Touch ID so that only you can mess with them.
* To learn more about what Falcon has to offer, check out our full review.
* Kaze – FREE

* Kaze brings one of the most popular ways to multitask from Auxo into a standalone jailbreak tweak.
* By swiping up from your select ‘hot corner,’ you can easily access any of your recently used apps without ever lifting your finger from your display. When you do, the app you had selected will launch.

* ReformX – FREE

* ReformX is another jailbreak tweak that is worth checking out, mostly because it lets you change up your Home screen any way you’d like to.
* Free of cost, this is like a lite version of Springtomize, and lets you change up your Home screen, dock, and folder icons any way you like, among many other miscellaneous settings.
* Anyone who is into deep customization of their devices should check this tweak out, and we have a full review you can check out if you’re interested in learning more about it.
* Spin10 – $0.99

* Spin10 is a great tweak for changing up the way your Lock screen looks when you have music playing on your device.
* Instead of the normal blocky Now Playing interface that normally shows up, Spin10 takes a much rounder approach to things by bringing circular album artwork, circular buttons, and even a circular song scrubber to your Lock screen.
