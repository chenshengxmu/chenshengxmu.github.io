* As noted by Cult of Mac‘s Killian Bell, Apple now offers text alerts for order and pickup status of warez bought through its online store. The new feature is available here and at the time of this writing was limited to United Stats and Canada, though other regions may follow at a later stage…
* They call it Apple Notifications and it’s available as the “Now get order status updates by text messages” link which appears at the bottom of various sections of the online Apple Store.
* Here’s from Apple:
* Apple Notifications is a text-message-based alerts service designed to keep you up-to-date on your shipment and/or pickup notification status. In addition to standard email notifications, you can also request text message updates when you’re in Checkout. The number of messages you’ll receive will vary depending on the orders you placed.
* The service supports the following carriers in the United States and Canada: Alltel, AT&T, Boost Mobile, Cricket, Nextel, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile USA.

* It’s pretty straightforward: once your order ships, or is available for pickup, Apple will text you with your order number and a link to online Order Status.
* The company warns that texts are sent between 8:00am and 9:00pm “in your time zone”.
* To stop receiving text notifications, simply reply STOP to the text message. Texting HELP to 83372 will give you additional information.
* Cool, no?
