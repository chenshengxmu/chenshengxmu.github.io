title: iOS 11.2 fixes the Calculator input lag

* As we reported, Appleâ€™s Calculator app on iOS 11 suffers from a lag when typing too quickly.
* Thankfully, iOS 11.2 no longer blocks all input during the animation for the button fades. By squashing that annoying bug (a design oversight?), the Calculator app now lets you enter numbers and other symbols in rapid succession without any problems.
* As we explained, the Calculator app in the current commercial version of iOS 11 fails to register any touch events before an animation for the button fades has finished playing.
* Needless to say, this causes problems if you type too quickly.
* This annoying issue has persisted throughout all iOS 11 betas during the testing period. Worse, it has somehow managed to remain unfixed in all of the stable builds of the software.
* Have you noticed other changes in iOS 11.2 beta 1?
* If so, share them with us in the comment section below!
