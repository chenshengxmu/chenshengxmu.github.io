* If you’re jailbroken, and have a little patience, you can get WhatsApp’s new in-beta voice calling feature on your iPhone right now. To do so, you’ll need to download the WhatsApp beta, download a package from Cydia, and following a couple of additional steps.
* After following this tutorial, you will be able to access voice calling in WhatsApp. I can personally verify that this technique works, and was able to shoot a video walkthrough showing you the steps along with a live phone call.
* Note: in most circumstances you will need AppSync installed to install the beta. You can get AppSync by adding this repo to Cydia: http://cydia.angelxwind.net
* Step 1: Download and install the WhatsApp beta while on your iPhone
* Step 2: Add the following repo to your list of Cydia sources: http://apt.imokhles.com (see note below)
* Step 3: Install the WhatsApp Call Enabler package, and enable it via Settings
* Step 4: Login to WhatsApp and message a friend with activated calling and they can call to activate you.
* Step 5: The contact will (hopefully) return your call and then the calling feature will be activated
* It’s pretty simple. The hardest part is just being patient enough to wait for the return phone call.
* Special thanks to reddit user akshitgupta95 for being so kind to assist with this. What do you think?
* Update: Some are stating that this can be done without using the tweak, and thus, without needing a jailbroken device. I’ve not been able to independently confirm that, but you may want to try it on your device. I recommend trying that first before using the tweak referenced above. Also, you can receive a call from anyone who has the calling activated, so if you have a friend with it, you can have them call you instead of using the number referenced in the post and video. Hope that helps!
