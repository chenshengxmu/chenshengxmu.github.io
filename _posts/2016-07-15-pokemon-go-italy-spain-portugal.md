* Nintendo’s tremendously successful Pokémon Go is expanding in more countries across Europe. In addition to releasing on the App Store in Germany and the United Kingdom a few days ago, the augmented-reality game which requires people to go out hunting for pokémon is now available for download in Italy, Spain and Portugal.
* The game is available on a freemium basis, with optional In-App Purchases ranging from 99 cents to as much as $99. According to a Sensor Tower survey, players in the United States are spending approximately $1.6 million per day on in-app transactions within the iOS edition of the game alone.
* In terms of daily active users, Pokémon Go is the biggest mobile game in US history and this past weekend has managed to surpass Twitter by the same metric.
* “When you look at the way it’s becoming a social phenomenon in the U.S., the rally is understandable even though it’s not clear yet how much it will boost profits,” analyst Toshiyuki Kanayama told Reuters.
* As of today, you can download Pokémon Go in the following countries:
* Developer Niantic Labs, which created the game in co-operation with Nintendo and Pokémon Company, is planning on gradually bringing it to a total of 200 markets as Pokémon Go continues to top App Store charts in the countries where it’s currently available.
* Unfortunately, the game’s augmented-reality concept has claimed its victims, and we’re not referring to sore feet and light injuries caused by Pokémon hunters slamming into street signs or falling off their skateboard.
* In San Diego’s North County, two men fell off a 75ft cliff Wednesday while playing the game, the Encinitas Fire Department confirmed. Remarkably, neither men has suffered serious injuries. And in New York state, a driver ran his car off the road and into a tree last night as a result of playing the game.
* Pokémon Go has received two updates following its July 6 debut on iOS and Android.
* The first update squashed a bunch of bugs and fixed an annoying problem with the game requiring full Google Account access, while the second update contains fixes for Pokémon Trainer Club login.
