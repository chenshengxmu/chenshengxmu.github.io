* It looks like Valve might try again to get its Steam Link app approved by Apple for the App Store. This week, a new Steam Link beta appeared in TestFlight, Apple’s testing playground for software developers. The beta doesn’t contain any TestFlight notes, which suggests that Value is only seeking performance-related feedback at this time, according to AppleInsider.
* Back in May, Apple blocked Valve’s first attempt at bringing Steam video games to iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. The iPhone maker claimed “business conflicts” forced it to reject the Steam Link app. Valve appealed the decision, to no avail.
* Subsequently, Apple’s Phil Schiller noted the Steam Link app “violates some guidelines around user-generated content, in-app purchases, content codes, etc.” He mentioned that Apple would continue to work with Valve to bring the app within the App Store guidelines.
* As we noted previously, the Steam Link app uses the same H.264 video encoding technology found in Valve’s physical Steam Link box. What the app basically does is stream your library of Steam games from your Windows or Mac desktop to an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second over a 5 GHz Wi-Fi network or a wired Ethernet connection.
* Games are the most lucrative part of the App Store. Therefore, it’s understandable that the company wants to protect its interests. Nonetheless, rejecting the Steam Link app never felt right since you couldn’t use it to buy new titles. Still, as AppleInsider discovered, workarounds were quickly found that enabled purchases to take place, which is a big no-no for Apple.
* Hopefully, Apple and Valve will come to some agreement that will allow the Steam Link to takes its rightful place in the iOS and Apple TV app stores. We’ll let you know if and when they do.
