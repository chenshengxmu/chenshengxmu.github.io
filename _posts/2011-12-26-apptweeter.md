* The sharing option for Apple’s “Tell a Friend” feature in the App Store is a bit on the limited side. With a stock iPhone, you can’t even use iOS 5’s Twitter integration to tell your friends about your favorite apps.
* Jailbroken iPhones, on the other hand, can — thanks to a recently released jailbreak tweak by the name of AppTweeter. Check inside for the full rundown…
* AppTweeter allows you to tweet out specific information about your favorite App Store apps, including the app’s icon, the company behind the app, app size, rating, and iOS version required. You can pick and chose which of the aforementioned credentials will be included in your tweets from a convenient settings panel in the Settings app.
* AppTweeter is a free tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’re looking to diversify the App Store’s sharing options, then look no further than AppTweeter.
* The only question left to ask is this: Would you use it?
