* Out of all the things you can change on a jailbroken iPhone or iPad, it’s easy to forget that you can also customize the Cydia app itself. Fortunately, this little-known fact didn’t slip the mind of iOS developer CydiaGeek.
* His latest jailbreak tweak release, dubbed Mypomonella, lets you modify various aspects and behaviors of the Cydia app until you’re satisfied.
* After you’ve installed Mypomonella, you can navigate to the Settings app and open the tweak’s preference pane. Here, you can tinker with various toggle switches that customize the Cydia app accordingly:

* Among the things you can do here are:
* The developer doesn’t include a respring button in the preference pane because it isn’t necessary to do so. You can save your changes by force-quitting the Cydia app from the App Switcher and re-launching it.
* Some options in Mypomonella are more useful than others. For example, disabling auto-refresh can prevent you from waiting extended periods when you just want to install or uninstall something from Cydia. Furthermore, you can avoid accidental button taps that disturb your workflow by disabling the ones you never use.
* Everyone’s sure to have different views concerning the most useful features in Mypomonella, but that’s the beauty of having so many options baked into a single tweak.
* If you’d like to give Mypomonella a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8-10 devices.
* Do you have a use for any of Mypomonella’s features? Share in the comments section below.
