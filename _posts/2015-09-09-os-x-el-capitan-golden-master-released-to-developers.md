* Apple has seeded the golden master version of the latest update to its desktop operating system, OS X 10.11 El Capitan. The update, which comes with a build number of 15A282b, is now available on Apple’s Developer Center for registered developers. It is also available for public beta testers via Apple’s beta website.
* Like the iOS 9 GM seed, which also was released today, this will likely be the final version of the OS X 10.11 beta before it is released to the public.
* OS X El Capitan brings several big features to the Mac, including a new Split View option for side-by-side multitasking, improved Spotlight and Mission Control functionality, an updated Notes app, updated Safari, and more.
* I don’t think anyone would say that El Capitan is a groundbreaking OS X release, but it’s a more of a refinement release that polished and improved upon the current-gen OS X Yosemite.
* Baring some major problems with the GM seed, you can expect this version to be the version that ships to customers at the end of the month on September 30th.
* Are you excited for OS X El Capitan?
