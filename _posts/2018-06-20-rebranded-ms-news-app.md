* Microsoft today launched a rebranded Microsoft News app for iOS and Android. The company is also using the name for its engine that powers the popular MSN.com site, as well as the news in their Edge browser, Windows 10, Skype, Xbox and Outlook.com.
* But the app doesn’t just have a new name, it also has a new look. Microsoft News has been completely redesigned into a modern and beautiful experience with new features such as enhanced personalization, a new dark theme and custom breaking news alerts.

* Microsoft adds that it has developed AI capable of scanning the more than 100,000 pieces of content daily and processes it to understand things like freshness and topic type. That content then goes to a group of more than 800 editors around the globe for curation.
* Microsoft News app is available in the App Store for free.
* So, are the new design and features enough to get you to give Microsoft News a look?
