* Even with the success of Apple Pay, wallet cases are still an extremely popular choice for iPhone owners. They protect your handset, as well as hold your drivers license, debit/credit cards in case you can’t use Apple Pay, and cash in the event all other payment methods are unavailable.
* There are a lot of options out there, so we’ve decided to put together a roundup of what we believe are the best wallet cases for the iPhone X. We have picks for every budget and design preference, including thinner, minimal plastic wallet cases and larger, more premium leather cases.
* As you may know, the iPhone X features Qi wireless charging tech which allows you to recharge your iPhone on a compatible charging pad without the need to plug-in cables. What you may not know is that Qi uses electromagnetic induction, and of course anything involving magnets and credit cards is bad news. So if a case’s card slots sit between the back of your iPhone and the wireless pad, you may want to remove them before charging, or it could render your cards unreadable. Also, the thickness of your case can affect wireless charging efficiency, so that’s something to keep in mind as well.
* Anyway, without further ado, here are the best wallet cases for iPhone X:

* You can’t put together a roundup of the best wallet cases and not mention Twelve South’s BookBook. Its miniature book design has been a staple in the category for years. The iPhone X version features beautiful top grain leather, 4 card slots (including a transparent ID slot), a side pocket to stow cash, a removable protective shell, and it doubles as a viewing stand.
* Buy for $51*

* The Silk Vault is another wallet case that may look familiar. Its simple, minimal design and low price tag have made it a fan favorite for years. The iPhone X model features a rear card slot that fits up to 3 cards and cash, high-grip textured sides, protective air pocket corners, and it even comes with a free screen protector. Measures 0.6 inches thick.
* Buy for $15

* Apple’s own iPhone X Leather Folio is one of the most expensive wallet cases on this list, but how could we not mention a case designed by the very phone’s creator? It’s made of specially tanned and finished European Leather, has a soft microfiber lining for your phone, and it has two large slots for multiple cards, cash and receipts. Also has Smart Cover-esque open-to-wake function.
* Buy for $96

* If you require a wallet case with a little more ruggedness to it, consider the Strada Series case from Otterbox. The brand name is virtually synonymous with phone protection, and its Strada case features a folio design with premium leather, inner and outer shells of protection, and of course a slot for cards/cash. Comes with a lifetime warranty.
* Buy for $33*

* Back on the more premium side of things, we have Pad and Quill’s Bella Fino wallet case. It features luxurious full grain American leather, card slots with transparent ID pouch, cash slot, and a slim 0.28-inch profile. It looks sharp and can hold up to 5-7 card and cash. Plus, it comes with a 25-year warranty on the leather.
* Buy for $90

* If you want a leather wallet case, but aren’t a fan of the folio aesthetic, check out Mujjo’s full leather Silhouette case. This minimal, all-in-one cover easily snaps onto your iPhone X and has a built-in card slot on the back that can hold up to 3 cards, cash or whatever else you can get to fit. Comes with 2 year warranty.
* Buy for $50
* And that should do it! Obviously we will update this list as we are made aware of and test new cases. And as always, if you have any good suggestions that we might have missed, feel free to let us know about them in the comments below and we’ll check them out.
