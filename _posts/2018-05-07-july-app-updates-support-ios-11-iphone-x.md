* Those ugly black bars in apps that don’t take advantage of the native iPhone X resolution?
* They’ll soon become a thing of the past.
* That’s because Apple has told its registered developers that all updates to existing apps submitted for approval starting this July will be required to support iOS 11 and iPhone X.
* If an update submitted after the cut-off period still does not take advantage of iOS 11 technologies or fails to take full advantage of the taller iPhone X display, it will be rejected.
* Here’s Apple’s message to developers:
* iOS 11 delivers innovative features and the redesigned App Store to hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Your apps can deliver more intelligent, unified and immersive experiences with Core ML, ARKit, new camera APIs, new SiriKit domains, Apple Music integration, drag and drop for iPad and more.
* Starting July 2018, all iOS app updates submitted to App Store must be built with the iOS 11 SDK and must support the Super Retina display of iPhone X.
* As of April 2018, all new iOS apps must be optimized for iPhone X.
* Many app makers have supported the edge-to-edge iPhone X OLED panel right from the onset, but there are a few notable holdouts. A good example is the Inbox app from the Gmail team.
* According to Google, they’re working on bringing iPhone X compatibility to the Inbox app, but the process took longer than expected amid bigger changes coming to the software.
* Are you supportive of this change?
