* Apple started offering refurbished iPad 4 and iPad mini back in March, bringing the used 16GB iPad mini down to $299, representing a modest $30 saving. Refurbished products are always good buys as these little-used devices are good as new: Apple tests them for defects, throws in a brand new battery and outer shell and backs them with its standard one-year AppleCare warranty.
* After realizing some people were kinda hoping for deeper discounts, Apple just instituted an additional $50 price cut on the second and third-generation cellular iPad refurbs. For example, the entry-level cellular iPad 2 with sixteen gigabytes of storage originally cost $399 refurbished, but customers can now pick it up for $349 for an additional $50 discount, or a nice $180 saving over its usual $529 asking price…
* The iPad 2 was released in March 2011.
* The 32GB/64GB 3G iPad 2 models are now available refurbished for $429/$529.
* The refurbished entry-level cellular iPad 3 used to be a $459 value, but is now available with an addition $50 discount for just $409 for a total savings of $170.
* The 32GB/64GB refurbs will set you back $499/$579.
* The iPad 3 was released in March 2012.

* Check out Apple’s special deals sections for the cellular iPad 2 and iPad 3 units for discounts on other models.
* Last week brought us fifth-generation iPod touch refurbs.
* Apple now features fifth-gen 32GB/64GB iPod touch refurbs with a $50 saving over their factory-new counterparts. The fourth-gen 16GB iPod touch is $169 refurbished, a $30 discount from its regular $199 price.
* Unfortunately, eBay’s certified refurbished outlet which used to undercut Apple’s asking prices for used products, is no more as Apple appears to have shut it down.
