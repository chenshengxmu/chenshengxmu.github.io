* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with CHOMP, by Christoph Niemann. This means that from now through next Thursday, you can pick up the popular interactive storybook app for free for both iPhone and iPad—a solid $3 savings.
* CHOMP combines playful, humorous, hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, almost anything is possible!
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Ready to unleash your cartoon alter ego? CHOMP takes your face and sticks it on dozens of interactive animations, letting you instantly record the bizarre and hilarious results. Scenarios can turn you into a wacky superhero, a concert pianist, a panda–even water dripping from a tap. The beautiful, simple, feel-good illustrations make for the type of silly fun that guarantees laughter from all ages.
* And here’s a clip of the app in action:
* You can download CHOMP in the App Store for free.
