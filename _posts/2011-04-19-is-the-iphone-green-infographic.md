* Apple has been criticized by some environmental organizations for its recycling practices. These activists claimed that Apple was slow to remove toxic chemicals from their products and lacked a proper recycling plan for old products.
* Steve Jobs addressed these complaints in a letter entitled “A Greener Apple.” The consensus of the note was that Apple was currently (or would soon be) leading the pack in all measurable areas of environmental impact. Apple products like MacBooks and Mac Pros certainly seem environmentally friendly thanks to their aluminum builds, but what about the iPhone?
* The folks over at Geekaphone have just finished their green study of the iPhone and have wrapped the results into this delightful infographic. Even if you’re not interested in the environmental impact of Apple’s smartphone, the facts at the bottom are worth the read.
