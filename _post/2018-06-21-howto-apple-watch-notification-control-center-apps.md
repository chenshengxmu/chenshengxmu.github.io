* Thanks to a new Apple Watch gesture in watchOS 5, you can pull down the Notification Center panel or bring up the Control Center overlay while using any first or third-party watchOS app.
* Older watchOS editions let you swipe up or down to open Control or Notification Center, but you could only do this from the watch face. What you couldn’t do is swipe while in an app because that would clash with scrolling and other in-app gestures due to the small display size.
* Say I’m chatting in the Messages app and want to see my notifications.

* Opening Notification Center while using iDownloadBlog’s app for Apple Watch
* Before watchOS 5, I had to resort to a multi-step process. First, I would press the Digital Crown to get back to my watch face, then swipe from the top to access my alerts. And when I was finished reading them, I had to find my way back into the the app I had been using earlier.
* While watchOS 5 still lets you swipe up or down from the watch face like you normally would, now you can take advantage of a brand new gesture within apps to reveal a handle used for dragging the Notification Center panel or the Control Center overlay into full view.
* To access your Notification Center while in an app, do the following:
* 1) Wake your Apple Watch display.
* 2) Tap and hold the top edge of the display.
* 3) When the handle appears near the top edge of the display under your finger, just swipe down to bring the Notification Center panel down and see your recent alerts.

* The only places this gesture doesn’t work is the Home screen and the Dock.
* To open Control Center while using an app, do the following:
* 1) Wake your Apple Watch display.
