* You probably haven’t noticed it personally, but did you know that banner notifications are supressed while the Siri interface is open? Well, to be honest, I didn’t either, until I saw this tweak pop-up in Cydia.
* The premise behind Unveil is simple, allow banner notifications to be displayed within the Siri interface. If you’re someone who absolutely must have access to banner notifications at all times, then Unveil is something you should consider using.
* After installing Unveil it just starts working, hence, there are no options to configure. Unveil is a simple tweak that, in my opinion is not absolutely necessary, because the banner notifications appear immediately after the Siri interface is closed.
* Knowing that, if you’d still like to try Unveil, then head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo where it can be downloaded for free. If you’re browsing this post on your jailbroken iOS device, then you can hit up this link for a direct link to the tweak on Cydia.
* What do you think about Unveil? Is it something that you plan on installing on your jailbroken device?
