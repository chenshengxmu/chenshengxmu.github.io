* Saurik has released an update for Cydia Substrate on Monday for jailbroken iOS devices, bringing the software up to version 0.9.6301 in the Cydia Store.
* The update for Cydia Substrate fixes a bug that could cause the software to stop injecting on iOS 6, which as it sounds, would lead to problems with jailbreak tweaks and other Cydia Substrate-dependent extensions.
* Saurik notes that the problem may have affected other jailbroken versions of iOS too, but no other examples are given as this was mainly an iOS 6-oriented problem.
* To get the update, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch Cydia on your jailbroken iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad.
* 2) Open the Changes tab from the bottom of the app.

* 3) Tap on the Refresh button to refresh your sources and see the latest upgrades.
* 4) When Cydia Substrate pops up under the Available Upgrades header, tap on the blue Upgrade (1) button at top right of the app.
* 5) Next, tap on the blue Confirm button at the top of the Queuing interface.
* 6) After the installation completes, tap on the Return to Cydia button at the bottom of the Cydia Installer interface.
* Now you have the latest version of Cydia Substrate installed.
* This update is recommended for everyone who has a jailbroken device, as it has the latest bug fixes and improvements, which spell out the best stability.
* Whether or not injecting problems were plaguing you, nothing works better to fix potential bugs than performing preventive maintenance by keeping your software up to date.
