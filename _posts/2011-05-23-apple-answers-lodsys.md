* You might have heard of Lodsys, a company that has been threatening to sue iOS developers for patent infringement, namely patents that evolve around in-app purchases. Even though Apple is licensed to legally use the patent, Lodsys claims that app developer are not and they should pay the company small royalty fees.
* After being called out by the EFF for not taking a stand for its app developers, it seems that Apple finally decided to speak up. In a letter sent to Lodsys, Bruce Sewell, Apple Senior Vice President and General Counsel, was quoted saying the following:
* Apple is undisputedly licensed to these patent and the Apple App Makers are protected by that license. There is no basis for Lodsys’ infringement allegations against Apple’s App Makers. Apple intends to share this letter and the information set out herein with its App Makers and is fully prepared to defend Apple’s license rights.
* […]
* Therefore, Apple requests that Lodsys immediately withdraw all notice letters sent to Apple App Makers and cease its false assertions that the App Makers’ use of licensed Apple products and services in any way constitute infringement of any Lodsys patent.
* You can read the full letter at MacWorld [warning: it’s boring legal talk].
* In short, developers are covered by the patent Apple is licensing from Lodsys and the company shall stop threatening iOS developers of Apple might get angry.
* Hopefully this puts an end to the ridiculous legal threats.
