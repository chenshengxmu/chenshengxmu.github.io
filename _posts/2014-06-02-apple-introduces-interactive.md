* Now that it’s done talking about OS X Yosemite, Apple has moved on to iOS 8. And one of the first major new elements in the software is called Interactive notifications. This includes a couple of features, but without a doubt, the most notable one is quick reply…
* Craig Federighi demonstrated the new feature on stage by showing a message notification popping up on an iPhone Lock screen, and within one tap, he was able to reply to the message without opening the Messages app. This has been a long-time requested feature, and a popular reason for iPhone users to jailbreak.

* And Interactive notifications goes beyond quick reply. For calendar events, users will see Accept and Reject buttons appear next to a notification on their Lock screen or in Notification Center. So again, they won’t have to open up the Calendar app to address the notification.
* Hopefully this functionality will eventually spill over to third party apps (i.e.: dismissing a Facebook Message without opening Facebook).
