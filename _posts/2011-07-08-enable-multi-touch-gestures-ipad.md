* My iPad 2 is currently running iOS 5 Beta 2, and one of my favorite features is without a doubt the multi-touch gestures. These allow you to perform basics tasks such as flicking through apps, closing apps, or making the multitasking tray appear – all with simple gestures.
* We’ve already seen how to enable multi-touch gestures on the iPhone, but with the recent iPad 2 jailbreak, many people have been asking me how to enable those gestures on the iPad. Turns out that’s it’s still the same old process, but I thought it’d be nice to revive this post for those that are new to jailbreaking…
* This post will show you how to enable multi-touch gestures on your iPad.
* Step 1: Make sure your iPad is jailbroken. If not, see our jailbreak section.
* Step 2: Launch Cydia and search for “MT Gestures Theme.” Install this app. If you don’t have WinterBoard installed, it will install it as well.
* Step 3: Launch WinterBoard and select the right gestures for your device. Close WinterBoard and let your iPad respring.
* Step 4: Go to Settings > General > and turn Multitasking Gestures to ON.
* That’s it. Now enjoy multi-touch.
