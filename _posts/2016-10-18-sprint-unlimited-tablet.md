* I don’t trust “unlimited” wireless plans because they’re all but unlimited and often come with a bunch of caveats one needs to consider carefully. The latest example: Sprint’s newly announced data plan for tablets which promises unlimited 4G LTE data in exchange for $20 per month. So far so good, but the devil—as always—is in the detail.
* If you take a closer look at the fine print, you soon realize that the plan limits video streaming to DVD-like 480p resolution, music streaming quality to 500kbps and your online gaming streams to up to 2Mbps.
* These limitations area laughable in this day and age of high-definition video/audio, high-resolution mobile screens and the prevalence of online gaming.
* Be that as it may, Sprint’s new plan, part of its Unlimited Freedom offering, is being offered exclusively for tablets.
* Some of the things to consider:
* For tablets capable of SMS, this plan also offers unlimited texting.
* Sprint’s tablet offering includes the iPad Air, iPad Air 2 and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which are available for $0 down and with 24 monthly installments ranging from $15 per month to $30.42 per month, depending on your iPad model and credit score
* You see this plan for yourself and tell me if you honestly believe that these are fair terms.
