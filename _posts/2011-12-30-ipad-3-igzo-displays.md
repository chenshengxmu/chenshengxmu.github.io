title: Rumor- Apple to Use IGZO Displays in Upcoming iPad

* There’s been no shortage of iPad 3 chatter over the last few weeks. We’ve heard Apple’s upcoming tablet could feature anything from a 7-inch display to 20-hour battery life, and seemingly everything in between.
* The latest report, however, is particularly interesting. It claims that the next-generation iPad will sport an advanced, high-resolution IGZO display (indium gallium zinc oxide).
* The rumor comes from the extremely hit-or-miss Digitimes publication. The site has been the source of several recent iPad 3 rumors, some of which, have already been debunked. But ignore that for a moment.
* IGZO panels are kind of a big deal. They can offer resolutions of up to 330 dots-per-inch for larger displays without any of the caveats. They don’t require dual-bar LED backlighting, which would make a tablet significantly thicker, and they’re extremely power efficient.
* And we don’t have to just take Digitimes’ word for it either, there’s other evidence. AppleInsider points to a recent investor note from Jeffries analyst Peter Misek regarding the subject:
* “In our view, this [IGZO panels] should lead to several design advantages, namely the device can be thinner, battery life should be longer, and the overall experience for users should be meaningfully improved.”
* And who is expected to be manufacturing these displays? Sharp. You know, that Japanese company that Apple is rumored to have recently invested a billion dollars in? Yeah, that Sharp.
* We try to maintain a certain level of criticism with Apple rumors, but given the fact that IGZO panels exist, and have been proven to be mass-manufacturable, we wouldn’t be surprised if this one materialized. And if it did, we could see an iPad 3 next year with a Retina display, extended battery life, and hardware that’s as thin, if not thinner, than the current model. Wow.
