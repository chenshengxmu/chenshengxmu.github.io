* While following the keynote yesterday and trying to cover the event at the same time here on iDB with the rest of the team, there seemed to be one word I didn’t hear Eddy Cue pronounce: streaming. I actually made a note of it in our Let’s Talk iOS episode dedicated to WWDC 2015.
* It seemed odd that the word wouldn’t even get a mention. To confirm the omission was on purpose, I took a look at Apple’s mini-site dedicated to Apple Music, and realized the word streaming is nowhere to found there either. It’s like it’s not even part of the offer. Is the S-word taboo? 
* Watching the keynote again later that day, I realized I was wrong as Cue did mention the word “stream” once. Still, for such a major part of the new Apple Music service, I started to wonder why the company didn’t make a bigger emphasis on a feature that it clearly hopes will replace the likes of Spotify and Pandora for many Apple users.
* My guess was that Apple considers itself bigger and better than streaming. In typical Apple fashion, I imagined the company wouldn’t want its new music service to be dubbed as a streaming one, but rather one that allows you to enjoy virtually unlimited music listening. As it turns out, I wasn’t too far from reality.
* When asked about the lack of mention of the word “streaming” in an interview with Rolling Stone, Cue explains:
* To be fair, I did use the word ‘stream’ once. I said, ‘You can search and stream the billions and billions of songs from iTunes.’ We don’t have anything wrong with saying that. It’s just — we’re not a streaming service. That’s not the way we think of ourselves. We think of this as a much bigger product that has a lot of features of it, of which a music subscription or streaming service is one of those.
* If you won’t find the word “stream” on Apple’s website when talking about Apple Music, the company did use the word four times in its press release about the new service.
* So why mention streaming in the press release then?
* Press releases are not meant for the general public. They’re meant for the press. And I believe the press had to be told loud and clear that Apple Music is indeed a streaming service in order to avoid any kind of confusion.
* For the end user though, Apple Music is not streaming. It’s part of an experience that lets you enjoy an unlimited amount of music.
