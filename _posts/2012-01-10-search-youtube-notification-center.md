* After the deluge of Notification Center tweaks that were made available right after iOS 5’s release, the amount of tweaks targeting iOS 5’s crown jewel has stymied off significantly.
* That’s not to say that there are no Notification Center tweaks being made — YouTube Search for Notification Center is evidence that they still are — but since there are less, I tend to put the more recent releases under the microscope a bit more.
* With that in mind, how does YouTube Search for Notification Center stack up?
* The answer to that is: decently. Make no mistake, the YouTube searches work from Notification Center, but the tweak is incredibly limited in function. It’s pretty obvious that it was created to be as simple and straight to the point as possible.
* All you do is open Notification Center, type in your query, tap search, and a Safari windows loads with your search query. Nothing more, nothing less.
* If all you want is basic YouTube search functions, then this tweak may be for you. But if you want something more robust, I highly suggest you check out the much more polished WeeSearch Pro.
