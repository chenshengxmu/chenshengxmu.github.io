* Apple’s Home app, which allows iPhone and iPad users to control smart appliances that are compatible with its HomeKit framework for the smart home, could be coming to the Mac platform via the next major release of the macOS operating system due this fall.
* According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman today, macOS 10.14 (code-named “Liberty”) “could involve” bringing to the Mac some of Apple’s own iPhone apps, including Home.
* Prior macOS updates brought some stock iOS apps to the Mac platform, like the now-removed Game Center app and existing apps such as Notes, Reminders, Messages and more.
* Both macOS 10.14 and iOS 12 (code-named “Peace”) are reportedly due this fall and will include a new apps platform allowing a single third-party app to work on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. It’s unclear if Home for Mac will take advantage of this rumored unified apps platform or be provided as a Mac-only binary.
* Gurman’s report also shares additional details pertaining to Apple’s renewed focus on software quality as the Cupertino company apparently plans to give its iOS and macOS engineering teams more time to work on new features and focus on under-the-hood refinements.
