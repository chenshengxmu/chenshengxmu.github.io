* We’re living in a multi-device world. Taking into account the never-ending stream of both existing form factors and new-category products, small wonder that the line is blurring.
* I’m of course referring to ultra-thin notebooks, smartphones, tablets and wearables that perform functions of smartwatches, fitness trackers, health bands and what not.
* But do we really need all this hardware in our lives? And even more to the point, can anyone in today’s multi-screen world safely do without owning all types of mobile gear?
* That’s the question I’d like to pose in today’s poll. Assuming you have enough spare cash lying around somewhere, would buying a notebook, a tablet, a smartphone and a watch benefit your mobile computing, do you think?
* Of course, Apple fans should interpret this poll as asking whether they’d be willing to spend their hard-earned cash on a MacBook, an iPad, an iPhone and a rumored iWatch.
* If you’re outside the Apple fold, replace “a notebook, a tablet, a smartphone and a watch” with “a MacBook, an iPad, an iPhone and an iWatch” and you’ll be good.
* Cast your vote below.
* FYI, as evidenced by latest comScore data quoted by Fortune, most Americans do on their smartphones what they did on their computers.
* Your thoughts are much appreciated.
