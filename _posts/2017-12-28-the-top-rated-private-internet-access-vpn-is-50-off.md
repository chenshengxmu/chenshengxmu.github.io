* Surfing on public Wi-Fi is certainly convenient, but it’s not exactly safe. If you’re unfortunate enough to be on the same network as a cybercriminal, you expose yourself and all of your personal information to attack. That’s why VPNs are an essential browsing tool in today’s hacking climate, and with Private Internet Access, you can arm yourself with secure, encrypted, and unrestricted browsing for more than 50 percent off.
* With Private Internet Access, you can encrypt your browsing traffic on up to five devices simultaneously, allowing you to surf anonymously and without restriction. Private Internet Access masks your location with IP cloaking and works to shut down ads, trackers, and malware — all of which can have a negative impact on your browsing speed, bandwidth, and even battery life. Plus, this software also includes a traffic killswitch that engages when your connection is unexpectedly terminated, shutting down any windows of opportunity for hackers to attack.
* Now, you can arm yourself with a year of Private Internet Access for $34.95, saving more than half off its normal $83.40 retail price.
* This deal is brought to you by StackCommerce, and although iDB handpicks each deal posted on the site, this does not constitute editorial endorsement. As we earn a small portion of all sales, you are effectively supporting iDB every time you purchase one of these deals.
