* Apple will soon begin conducting in-store hardware repairs for both the iPhone 5s and 5c, according to a new report by 9to5Mac. The company will be able to replace displays and other components on the new handsets, on-site.
* This means that Apple Stores will no longer have to replace an entire device due to a cracked screen, or a bad button. The initiative will not only help Apple save money, but will also keep users from having to setup new devices…
* Here’s Mark Gurman with the scoop:
* “The sources say that Apple will be providing its stores with special machinery to replace the touchscreens on both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. These machines will be used specifically to calibrate the displays. The screen replacements cost $149 for each device, and this price point is significantly more affordable than the several-hundred dollars required to completely replace a device with a damaged/cracked screen.
* In addition to displays, Apple will have the capability to replace the volume buttons, vibrating motor, rear-camera, and speaker system on the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. Apple Stores will be able to replace the conventional Home button on the iPhone 5c, but it does not appear that Apple will be able to conduct swaps for the Touch ID-based button on the iPhone 5s.”
* Part replacements due to defects will be free if the iPhone is still under AppleCare warranty. Otherwise, users will have to pay per-part repair fees: a new battery, for example, will cost $79, and a new iPhone 5c Home button will cost $29.

* In June, Apple began offering in-store display replacements for the iPhone 5 for $149. There’s no word yet on when this initiative kicks off, but the site says stores are already receiving training manuals for conducting these new repairs.
* What do you think about this? Would you rather have your iPhone repaired or replaced?
