* It’s here, folks. After weeks of anticipation, the Dev Team just released an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.1. This jailbreak is mostly due to the untether exploit found by i0n1c.
* This jailbreak works with every device that supports iOS 4.3.1, except for the iPad 2. So to be clear, this jailbreak will work with the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad 1, iPod Touch 4G, iPod Touch 3G, and the second generation of Apple TV…
* The Dev Team released 2 versions of the iOS 4.3.1 jailbreak. You can now use PwnageTool to jailbreak your iPhone while preserving the baseband (Mac only), or you can use RedSn0w (both Mac and PC versions available).
* If you rely on the UltraSn0w unlock, it is recommended that you wait for the Dev Team to update this tool before upgrading and jailbreaking.
* ultrasn0w users don’t update yet! We need to first release an update to ultrasn0w that fixes some incompatibilities when FW 4.3.1 is used on the older basebands supported by ultrasn0w.  And remember once we do fix ultrasn0w for 4.3.1 (we’ll announce it here and on twitter), you must only get there via a custom IPSW from PwnageTool, Sn0wbreeze or xpwn!  Don’t ever try to restore or update to a stock IPSW, or you’ll lose the unlock!
* You can download PwnageTool 4.3 and the RedSn0w 0.9.6rc9 jailbreak from our download section. If you’re not sure how to use these tools, make sure to check out our PwnageTool tutorial and our RedSn0w tutorial.
