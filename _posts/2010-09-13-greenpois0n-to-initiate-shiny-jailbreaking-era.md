title: GreenPois0n to Initiate Shiny Jailbreaking Era
---
* The “Fun Day” is arriving as Chronic Dev Team is working hard to release their first ever all iDevices jailbreak tool named GreenPois0n. It took them a while to release the Greenpois0n jailbreak as it was announced earlier this year but they were never able to push it out as promised.
* Chronic Dev Team and their Greenpois0n were even blamed to be fake as they accepted donations but never made a release. Some days ago, they made a strike by revealing a new bootrom exploit named SHAtter Exploit. This achievement means that iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4G, and iPad are jailbroken for life until Apple introduces hardware change in the devices by replacing the bootrom.

* The recent update by @pod2g who actually developed the exploit for a vulnerability discovered by @p0sixninja reveals that Greenpois0n is progressing steadily. The first release of Greenpois0n will jailbreak iOS 4.1. Obviously, there is no release date for Greenpois0n. Sit tight as an undimmed era for jailbreaking is soon to begin.
