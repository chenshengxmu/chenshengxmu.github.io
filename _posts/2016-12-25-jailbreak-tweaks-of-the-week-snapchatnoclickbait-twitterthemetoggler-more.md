* We’ve gone a long time without a jailbreak on Apple’s latest firmware (iOS 10), but there’s a chance we might be out of the dark tunnel, as iOS hacker Luca Todesco has launched a beta jailbreak with support for a limited set of devices on iOS 10.1.1. Obviously, we don’t recommend using it yet until it’s stabilized, but it’s a start!
* Regardless, those who are already jailbroken know that there were a small number of jailbreak tweak releases this week, and this roundup will put the spotlight on those. We’ll show you our favorites first, and then move on to the rest afterwards.
* TwitterThemeToggler – FREE

* TwitterThemeToggler is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you toggle Twitter’s Night Mode on and off with fewer taps.
* In fact, rather than having to tap on the screen four separate times to enter the Twitter settings menu and then find the Night Mode option and turn on the toggle switch, this tweak lets you toggle the feature on with a single tap and hold on the Twitter app’s navigation bar.
* The tweak works very well and provides users with a quicker way to reduce eyestrain when they’re staring at their Twitter news feed at night.

* SnapchatNoClickbait: Removes all the clickbaity links from the Snapchat app (free – review)
* Although that wraps it up for this week, there are sure to be more releases in the next coming weeks. With an iOS 10 jailbreak just over the horizon, we might just see an awakening in the jailbreak community that we haven’t seen in months. Of course, it probably won’t explode much until the jailbreak comes out of beta first and more people start using it.
