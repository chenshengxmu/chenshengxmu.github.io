* Good news for 500px users this afternoon. The popular photo sharing site has updated its iOS client with a handful of design and performance improvements, including some new iOS 7 UI tweaks and a new animated login screen.
* The 500px app has been iOS 7-friendly since October, but today’s update brings about full support for the new OS with things like beautiful blurred backgrounds, flattened icons, and more. The full 2.4 change log is up after the fold…
* Sign up with your email address, or take full advantage of your social presence by logging in with your Twitter, Facebook or other social accounts. It’s never been easier to join the premier photo community! 
* – A beautiful new animated login and tour experience. Join or log into the premier photo community with style using your email or your Twitter, Facebook, or other social accounts. – Full iOS 7 support with beautiful blurred backgrounds and more. – Edit your photos’ details, including title, description, tags, EXIF data, and location.
* I’ve always really liked the 500px app, and it gets even better with version 2.4. I’m a member of the free service, and while I don’t post pics taken with my iPhone, I like to use the app to manage my profile and view other photos on the go.
* For those interested, the 500px service comes in three flavors: a free version that allows you to upload 20 photos per month, and then two $25 per year and $75 per year options with more features. You can download the 500px app here.
