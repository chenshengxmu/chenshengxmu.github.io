* The Apple Watch Series 3 is almost what everyone has been waiting for in an Apple Watch since the beginning: the ultimate luxury of cellular connectivity such that an iPhone isn’t required to use the device.
* Although both cellular + GPS and -only models are available, and we go over the tech specs of both in this piece, so you’re aware of what’s under the hood on the latest Apple Watch models.
* Models & prices:
* Chips:
* Case Dimensions:
* 38mm
* 42mm
* Features:
* Connectivity:
* Display:
* Power:
* It seems as though there’s even less information available about the Apple Watch Series 3 than there was for the Apple Watch Series 2 when it was launched last year. What we do know is that the Apple Watch Series 3 holds the same dimensions as the previous generation.
* What we do know is that the Apple Watch Series 3 retains (mostly) the same dimensions as the previous generation, however to accomodate for some hardware changes, the back crystal is now just 0.25mm thicker. Additionally, only the Cellular + GPS model has the polarizing red Digital Crown.
