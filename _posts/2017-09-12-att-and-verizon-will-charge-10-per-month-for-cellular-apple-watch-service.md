* With some Apple Watch Series 3 models gaining cellular support, the big unknown from Apple’s event was the cost of that add-on to users’ existing phone plans. We’ve now had that answer as AT&T and Verizon have revealed to The Street that they will both charge $10 per month. T-Mobile also confirmed to iDB reader Matthew M. that the carrier will also be charging $10 per month.
* Similar to the way you can add an iPad to your plan for an additional $10 a month, you will be able to do the same for your cellular Apple Watch. Whether you’ll get your money worth is an entirely different question that each user should ponder.
* Starting at $399, the cost of ownership of a cellular Apple Watch will increase by $120 a year, a price that is not negligible, especially considering the limited benefits one might get out of it.
* To make the pill easier to swallow, some carriers will offer introductory pricing. Verizon, for example, will offer three free months of service for all new users.
* As for Sprint, it is unknown what their pricing will be, so is the pricing of carrier partners across the world.
* At $10 a month, is the added value of a cellular Apple Watch worth it to you?
