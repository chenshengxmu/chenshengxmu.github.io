* Apple said today its watch will be hitting seven new markets later this month, with the sole exception of the 42mm Space Black Stainless Steel model with Space Black Link Bracelet.
* In an email sent to customers who ordered that device, a copy of which was obtained by 9to5Mac, Apple has clarified that the 42mm Space Black Stainless Steel model with Space Black Link Bracelet won’t be arriving in retail stores until all online orders have been fulfilled.
* Additionally, availability of many Apple Watch bands has improved substantially as many are now shipping in one business day, WatchAware noted Thursday.
* According to Apple’s email notice, customers who previously ordered the 42mm Space Black Stainless Steel Apple Watch with Space Black Link Bracelet may not be able to pick up the device at their nearest Apple Store two weeks from now.
* Here’s Apple’s email:
* Thank you for ordering an Apple Watch. We’re working hard to ship orders as quickly as possible and in the order they were placed.
* As you may have heard, some models of Apple Watch will soon be available for purchase in Apple Retail Stores. We’d like you to know that the model you ordered will not be available for purchase in Apple Retail Stores until all current online orders have shipped.
* When your order ships, we’ll send you an email with a specific delivery date and tracking information. For the most up-to-date information about your order, please visit online Order Status.
* As an indication that Apple is now starting to catch up to Apple Watch demand, several bands are now shipping in 24 hours from the Apple Online Store. The complete list of bands shipping within that timeframe is as follows:
* The odds are good that the aforementioned bands could soon become available through brick-and-mortar Apple Stores. Apple’s webstore lists the $249 Modern Buckle as “currently unavailable” while the 42mm Milanese Loop is shipping in five to six weeks.

* On June 26, the Apple Watch should land on the shelves of Apple’s online and retail stores in Italy, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan.
* Select retailers like 10 Corso Como in Milan, BOONTHESHOP Cheongdam in Seoul and Malmaison by The Hour Glass in Singapore will have a curated selection of Apple Watch available beginning June 26.
* Some, but not all Apple Watch models will be available for walk-in purchases beginning June 26, Apple has said.
