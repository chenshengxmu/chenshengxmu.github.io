* Noted Australian leakster Sonny Dickson, who made a name for himself by supplying a steady stream of photos showing genuine components for unreleased Apple products, has been pretty silent lately. Silent, but not inactive.
* Yesterday, Dickson re-joined the rumor game by tweeting out a pair of quality images that appear to show off a 4.7-inch variant of the iPhone 7 next to its 5.5-inch brethren. Both devices are in Rose Gold and have a tweaked camera design on their backside.
* Top of post, you can clearly see iPhone-like devices in 4.7 and 5.5-inch varieties with an all-white front plate. The placement of the side buttons, the front-facing FaceTime camera and holes for the sensors at the top appear to be unchanged from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

* The devices’ backside reveals Rose Gold finish and most of the expected features, including subtler antenna bands that run across the top and bottom, changed cameras, a microphone hole, LED flash and more.
* On the 5.5-inch model, we can see a dual-lens imaging system with a curved camera termination while the 4.7-incher apparently has a bigger camera hole—again, all in line with past iPhone 7 rumors.
* Now, there are a few possibilities here.
* This could be:
* Still, we’re hesitant to claim the photos represent the real product because:
* I reached out to Dickson seeking clarification and will update the story with new information in case he replies. A lot of his followers on Twitter asked him to provide additional information, to no avail, so I’m not holding my breath either.
* What’s your take on these photos?
