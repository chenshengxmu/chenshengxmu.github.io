* “If you find yourself on holiday in Turkey, Brazil, Russia or Greece, try to avoid the Apple Store as iPhones are 25-50 percent more expensive than in the United States,” cautions strategist Jim Reid. And he’s right.
* According to Deutsche Bank’s annual “Mapping the World’s Prices”, iPhone prices can vary wildly from one country to another but one thing has remained true: the United States is still the cheapest place to buy an iPhone.
* Here’s what an iPhone 7 costs in Apple Stores in the following 33 countries:
* To be sure, the aforementioned prices are for the 128-gigabyte 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model.
* Deutsche Bank has obtained the prices from official Apple websites and online retailers. “In the absence of official prices via the websites, we have used prices from online retailers and news websites,” cautions Deutsche Bank.

* I’m based in Europe, one of the worst places to buy an iPhone.
* Apple likes to say that the cost of doing business in Europe is higher than in the US, which is true, but that doesn’t fully explain why people in Turkey are paying nearly one and a half times as much as users in the United States. Other factors are clearly at play here, including import taxes and other regulations specific to every country.
* It’s interesting that Turkey has now replaced Brazil as the most expensive expensive place in the countries surveyed to buy an iPhone 7.
* As Business Insider explains, that’s due to the combination of political instability in the country and the big ramp in US dollar appreciation against global currencies after Donald Trump’s win smashed Turkey’s Lira currency  late last year.
* As a result, Turkey has replaced Brazil as the most expensive place in the countries surveyed to buy an iPhone. By the way, Brazil now ranks second on the list with a 37 percent higher iPhone 7 price vs US.
* With iPhone 7 said to cost north of $1,000, I’m afraid to think what
