* You may have noticed over the past 24 hours that a new section has appeared in the App Store entitled “Apps & Games for iPhone 6.” As you’d expect, the section is meant to highlight apps and games that have been updated for the larger displays on the two new iPhones.
* There are likely thousands of apps that are compatible with the handsets, with many more to come. Apple rounded up about 65 of them, and we thought we’d share 10 of our favorites, so you know what apps we’ll be downloading when we get our new iPhones tomorrow.
