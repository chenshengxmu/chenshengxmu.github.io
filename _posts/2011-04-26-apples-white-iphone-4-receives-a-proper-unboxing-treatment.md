* True, the iPhone 4 has been out for like, forever, so it normally wouldn’t warrant an unboxing video.
* I mean, you could feel free to make an unboxing video for your iPhone 4 right now, and no one would care.
* But when you throw the color white into the ring, things change all of the sudden. Techies get excited, unboxing videos get made, and people grab their popcorn.
* Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you, the long lost cousin of the device you probably have sitting in your pockets right now…the White iPhone 4…
* I think this is literally going to bring a tear to my eye! No more white iPhone 4 rumors for us to cover, no more sleepless nights as I ponder the sad reality of a white-iphone-4-less world.
* It’s here folks, and this isn’t just some case replacement with pilfered Foxconn parts. No, this is the real thing.
* Now it’s question time: Are you sad that all of the white iPhone 4 rumors will come to a grinding halt? Are you getting one?
* C’mon, it’s been nearly a year already, vent you frustration, pleasure, pain, whatever, below!
