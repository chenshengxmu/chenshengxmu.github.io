* A Lens feature on Snapchat, originally introduced in September 2014, has just gotten a whole lot better because the latest update to the company’s iOS app now lets you—at long last—use augmented-reality Lenses with your iPhone’s rear camera. With Lenses, you can add real-time effects into your snaps, courtesy of the company’s advanced face-detection technology. Before today, Lenses were only available via the front-facing camera.
* “Today, we’re adding new ways to use Lenses,” said Snapchat.
* “While Snapping with the rear-facing camera, simply tap the camera screen to find new Lenses that can paint the world around you with new 3D experiences”.
* Watch the video below for an overview of the new Lenses on Snapchat.
* To use the new Lenses, open Snapchat to the camera screen and tap a new button in the top-right corner to switch between the selfie and rear camera. Tap on any surface and a selection of different Lenses appears at the screen bottom. Just swipe over to the World Lens you want to use and tap it to switch between different options.
* You can also drag a Lens to move it around or pinch your fingers in and out to change its size. Keep in mind that Text Lenses are currently available in a few specific places but the company has promised to launch them in other other areas soon.
* The ability to apply different Lens effects via the rear-facing iSight camera requires Snapchat version 10.6.2, which can be downloaded at no charge from App Store.
