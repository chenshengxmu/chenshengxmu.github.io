* Vimeo users will be happy to hear that the video streamer rolled out a new version of its iOS client today. The update brings the app to build number 4.1, and features an all-new design, as well as various other improvements.
* The new design is noticeable from the second you launch the app. It has sort of an iOS 7 feel, with lightweight elements and streamlined menus, and overall navigation has been improved. More details and screenshots below…
* Here are your release notes:
* What’s New in Version 4.1.00
* The Vimeo-est app ever: all-new look and feel with streamlined menus, more lightweight design, and a friendlier vibe.
* A new home for you: quick access to your videos, feed, likes, and Watch Later queue.
* View and edit info in a snap: tap a video to see its description and metadata; share, like, and add comments more easily.
* More personalized profiles: there’s a sweet new design, plus check out what videos people like, who they follow, and who follows them. 
* Speed demon: Faster video playback for all! 
* And a couple more screenshots:

* Although it seems like an afterthought in a world dominated by YouTube and Vine, Vimeo has been making some major moves recently. Last year, it became an official iOS partner, and it has since made two major app acquisitions.
* Anyway, if want to check out today’s update, you can find the latest version of the Vimeo app in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
