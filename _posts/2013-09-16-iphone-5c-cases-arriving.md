* Alongside the all-new iPhone 5c, Apple unveiled six new colorful cases for the handset last week. The company has taken some heat over their radical design, but it believes they’ll provide customers with an easy way to customize their devices.
* Made from silicon, with 35 small holes punched in the back, the accessory went on sale right next to the iPhone 5c pre-orders last Friday. And although the phone itself won’t start hitting doorsteps until Friday, some have already received their cases…
* Our very own Jim Gresham received his blue iPhone 5c case this afternoon, and has supplied us with a number of up-close photos. He also notes that the case feels great, inside and out, and it has more of a satin-feel instead of “limp and rubbery.”

* Jim will be back this weekend with a full review of the case once he’s paired it with his iPhone 5c. In the meantime, if you’d like to pick one up for yourself, you can find them on Apple’s website in black, white, pink, yellow, blue and green for $29.
* So, what do you think of Apple’s 5c case?
