* Every one has done it at least once. You listen to a phone message and, either you don’t think you’ll need to listen to it again, or you accidentally hit the delete button and you’ve lost the message forever. Or, maybe not.
* Apple must have known that we’d all be a bunch of delete-happy maniacs that have message-erasing remorse at some point in our lives. The good news is that there is a way to undelete and recover voicemails, and we’re going to tell you how.
* I just want to take a moment to remind our faithful readers that some of the how-to guides and tutorials that we write are intended for new iOS users. We know that a lot of you tech-savvy iPhone owners already know how to undelete Voicemail messages. This tutorial is for our new iOS-owning readers who may not have the guts to ask, for fear of being shunned by others…
* So, you’ve just accidentally deleted a Voicemail on your iPhone. Don’t worry, you can still save your job, or your relationship, or whatever that important message can do for you.
* Step 1: In the Phone app, tap the Voicemail icon at the bottom-right of the screen.
