* The first beta of the forthcoming OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 software update which contains the long-expected Photos for Mac application, is now available via the AppleSeed Public Beta service.
* Participants in the OS X Public Beta program can download the software update right now via the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. The public beta carries a build number of 14D87, the same like the second 10.10.3 beta that the company seeded to its registered Mac developers a week ago.
* As mentioned before, OS X 10.10.3 beta includes Photos for Mac with support for iCloud Photo Library, in addition to two-step verification for Google Accounts in System Preferences, more diverse emoji and other enhancements.
* Though no specific bugs are mentioned in release notes accompanying the download, Apple says the update will improve the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.
* The software should release for public consumption in mid-March.
* As noted by Twitter user DJ Jenkins, the download is available through the Updates tab in the Mac App Store, provided you have signed up for the AppleSeed OS X Beta software testing program here.
