* The Chronic Dev Team, as expected, has released an update to the Absinthe jailbreak tool to enable iPad 2,4 untethered jailbreak support for iOS 5.1.1.
* The iPad 2,4 is the updated version of the iPad 2 that features a new chipset yielding improved battery life. Due to the rarity of this version of the iPad 2, support was withheld until further testing could be done. Now it’s obvious that the testing was completed successfully…
* The Rocky Racoon 5.1.1 Untether has also been updated to version 1.0-3 as a result of the added support for the iPad 2,4.
* Head over to our downloads page to download Absinthe 2.0.4. Do you have an iPad 2,4? If so, let us know how the jailbreak experience goes once you use he latest version of Absinthe.
