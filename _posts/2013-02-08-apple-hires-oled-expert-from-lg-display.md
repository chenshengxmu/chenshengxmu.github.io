* Amidst growing rumors of Apple working on a larger-screened iPhone and a full-sized TV set, comes news today that the Cupertino company has hired a high-profile executive to join its prestigious Display group.
* His name is Dr. Jeung Jil Lee, and he’s a former senior OLED (organic light-emitting diode) expert from LG Display. The hiring reignites speculation that Apple is considering using the display tech in its products…
* OLED-Info.com reports:
* “Apple has hired a new executive into its Display group – Dr. Jueng Jil Lee, a former research fellow at LG Display, who apparently was involved with printing technology research. Dr. Lee’s previous employee (before LGD) was Cambridge Display Technology, the P-OLED pioneer (now owned by Sumitomo).
* Apple is interested in OLEDs, and the company already has several patents involving flexible OLEDs, OLED based BLUs for LCDs, OLED control schemes and others.”
* Apple has long been rumored to switch to OLED screens in its mobile lineup, which would allow for thinner devices and better battery life. But thus far, it continues to use LCD panels, which are much easier to manufacture.
* That talk, however, has died down in recent years, as as the latest chatter suggests the iPhone maker is looking at Sharp’s IGZO displays. IGZO (Indium gallium zinc oxide) tech offers similar, if not more superior, benefits.
* Regardless, I think that Apple’s hiring of Dr. Jueng Jil Lee is a good sign of things to come. Though Apple’s Retina Display tech has been the gold standard for mobile devices in recent years, it’s quickly getting left behind.
