* A new hero image has taken over Apple.com this morning, highlighting Apple’s Accessibility features in iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS just in time for Global Accessibility Awareness Day.
* For those wondering, Global Accessibility Awareness Day is the 3rd Thursday each May. It promotes digital accessibility and inclusion for people with all disabilities.
* “Technology is most powerful when it empowers everyone,” reads Apple’s teaser graphic. The banner is linked to the firm’s main Accessibility page at apple.com/accessibility.
* The webpage highlights Apple’s various and numerous Accessibility features available across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, including Zoom, Voice Over, Magnifier, Display Accommodations, Live Listen, Type to Siri, Switch Control and more.
* Back in March, the Cupertino company donated a cool $250,000 to sponsor an accessibility-focused playground that’s opening soon in Sunnyvale, California.
* Apple’s director of global accessibility policy and initiatives, Sarah Herrlinger, recently discussed the company’s efforts in this field with CNET.
* She underscored the recent accessibility updates, such as the wheelchair setting in watchOS. “Every year we try to add in new things. We do look at how can we make it slightly better year over year,” Herrlinger said.
