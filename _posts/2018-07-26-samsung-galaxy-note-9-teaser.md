* Ahead of the scheduled Unpacked 2018 announcement on August 9, Samsung today released a trio of Note 9 teaser videos via its official YouTube channel, hyping improved features such as a bigger, longer-lasting battery, a faster processor and lots of flash storage.
* Using the tagline “A lot can change in one day,” the videos suggest to the viewer that phone features like battery, speed and storage “will no longer be a problem” come August 9.
* If recent leaks are an indication, the next Note should have the best battery life of any Samsung smartphone—we’re hearing the built-in battery will be in the 4,000mAh range.
* Even though Galaxies have average battery life, Samsung hasn’t shied away from bashing iPhone batteries to promote its wireless charging and Adaptive Fast Charge system.
* Anyway, these are pretty nicely done videos so check them out embedded below.
* It’s pretty interesting, at least to me, that the videos seem to depict what appears to look like a generic Android device, a major change from Samsung’s latest anti-iPhone “Ingenius” ads.
* Are the latest Samsung videos yay or nay, do you think?
* Let us know by leaving a comment below.
