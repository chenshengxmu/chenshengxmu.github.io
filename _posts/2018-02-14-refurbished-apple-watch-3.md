* Apple has updated its [US] online store with refurbished Series 3 models of Apple Watch. Customers in the market for the wearable, which just launched in September, can pick up a GPS-only version for as little as $279.
* At the time of publishing, there were two refurbished Apple Watch Series 3 models available: 38mm GPS-only Gold Aluminum Case with Pink Sand Sport Band for $279 and 42mm GPS-only Space Gray Aluminum Case with Black Sport Band for $309. The savings equate to $50 off the original retail prices.
* It bears repeating that Appleâ€™s refurbished products are highly regarded by customers. They are tested, certified and include a full 1-year warranty. Watch models include a magnetic charging cable and come in a new white box.
