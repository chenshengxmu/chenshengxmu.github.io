* With just a few weeks until Apple’s rumored September 9 media event, small wonder we’re now seeing a bunch of parts for the upcoming ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ smartphones leaking out from Asian supply chain.
* European repair firm MacManiack was able to get hold of a fully assembled display component for the iPhone 6s from a supplier and today posted a video of it. This could also be a ploy to steal free publicity on the part of MacManiack so take the report with healthy skepticism.
* Holes for the front-facing FaceTime camera and the proximity sensor appear to be unchanged from the present-generation iPhone 6. But as AppleInsider noted, the ribbon connectors have been slightly altered and the shielding on the back of the LCD is now glued into place.
* The video runs one minute and 44 seconds long, here it is.
* “Apple has apparently chosen to integrate the home button — and accompanying Touch ID sensor — with the LCD and digitizer connectors, possibly in a bid to save space or make assembly simpler,” writes the publication.
* “The firm believes that a new connector on the display assembly’s rear points to Force Touch, but this is conjecture and other rumors have painted different pictures of that connector’s purpose.”
* In addition to this video, another leak this morning brought us claimed technical drawing and an accompanying video purportedly showing a fourth-generation iPad mini housing. The leak provides additional clues that the forthcoming device will file as Apple’s slimmest iPad mini yet.
* Apple is expected to unveil new iPhones and iPads alongside a next-generation Apple TV with downloadable apps, Siri and a touch-enabled remote at a rumored media event taking place on September 9.
