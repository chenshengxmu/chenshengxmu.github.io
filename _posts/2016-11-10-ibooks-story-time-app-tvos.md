* Apple on Thursday quietly launched a new app for tvOS called “iBooks StoryTime.” It’s a children’s app that allows them to read along with their favorite [compatible] books using special features built for television.
* These features include enhanced audio with unique character voices, sound effects and of course narration that makes it both easy and entertaining for kids to follow along with on their own devices or physical book.

* There appear to be a number of titles available at launch, including popular stories like The Little Red Hen, Chicka Chicka ABC, Big Brother Daniel, and various character books from the vaults of Disney and Sesame Street.

* Upon downloading the new app, Apple offers you a free book (mine was Dora the Explorer, I’m not sure if that varies at all) and you can access Previous Purchases. Otherwise it seems like the average Read Along title costs $3.
* iBooks StoryTime is available in the App Store for fourth generation Apple TV users.
