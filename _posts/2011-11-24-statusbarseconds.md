* I can honestly say that I think there’s a tweak for absolutely everyone on Cydia. Case in point: StatusBarSeconds, a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to add seconds to your iDevice’s status bar.
* Who needs something like that? Someone, apparently. Check inside for a video walkthrough of StatusBarSeconds in action…
* StatusBarSeconds features no app icons or settings panel; just install it and go. It’s free on Cydia for jailbroken devices.
* Beware that the developer warns that the changing seconds could cause your battery to drain prematurely.
* Have you given StatusBarSeconds a spin? Let us know what you think about it below.
