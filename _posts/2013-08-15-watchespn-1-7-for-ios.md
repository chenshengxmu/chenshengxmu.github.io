* Sports fans, rejoice: the freshly updated WatchESPN iOS app has been updated today with a cool new feature allowing for multitasking of sorts during live programming.
* The all-new Live Toolbar in WatchESPN version 1.7 for iPhone and iPad lets you keep up with news, scores and on-demand video from your favorite sporting events while watching multiple videos at once.
* That’s right: if you ever wanted to follow game highlights while watching live ESPN programming, now you can. You can easily switch to live ESPN programming without exiting the video currently being watched, with video highlights becoming available at the conclusion of a live event…
* Other features in WatchESPN 1.7 include iOS 7 compatibility, support for users connecting from a college or military network and the new ESPN on ABC feature that lets you launch ESPN content in the standalone WatchABC app.
