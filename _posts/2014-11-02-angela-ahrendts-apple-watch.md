* Apple’s Angela Ahrendts has told staffers that the highly anticipated Apple Watch will be launching in the spring, according to a new report from 9to5Mac. The site says the company’s Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores recently sent out a video message to employees, where she noted the new timeframe.
* More specifically, Ahrendts tells her employees that they are “sprinting a marathon,” hinting at the busy times the retail channel has ahead of them. From a transcript of her comments, she says “we’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.”
* Since Apple first announced the Apple Watch, it has repeatedly said that the device will be ready for launch in “early 2015,” but it has never been more specific. The fact that Ahrendts says “spring,” suggests the Watch won’t be available until at least March, meaning it will likely miss the all-important Valentine’s Day.
* First unveiled in September, the Apple Watch is Apple’s first wearable device and first new product category since the iPad. The device houses a number of features, including fitness tracking, and has the ability to receive notifications and phone calls. Prices start at $349, but the top gold model is expected to cost thousands.
