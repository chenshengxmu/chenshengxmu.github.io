* Logitech’s latest update to the Logi Circle app has brought a new snapshot feature to its popular HomeKit-equipped Circle 2 camera. The accessory maker is also expanding its premium subscription service for homes with multiple cameras.
* The new snapshot feature takes advantage of a newish feature in iOS that allows a picture or a video snippet to be included in a push notification.
* Whenever the Circle 2 detects motion, and you have Smart Alerts enabled, a notification will appear on your device with a picture of what triggered the motion. You can even view the video clip right from the notification, without having to jump into the app.

* This new feature is available for free and will arrive today in version 3.2 of the Logi Circle app.
* An extension of our Smart Alerts feature, Notification Snapshots is available for Android and iOS versions of the Logi Circle app and provides you with a visual “snapshot” of an event or scene sent straight to your phone’s home screen when motion triggers your Circle 2 camera.
* If you have multiple Circle 2 cameras, you may also be interested in Circle Safe subscriptions.
* For single-camera homes, Circle Safe Basic subscriptions are now $3.99 per month and Circle Safe Premium subscriptions are $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year.
* For up to 5 cameras, Circle Safe Basic Home starts at $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, while Circle Safe Premium Home starts at $17.99 per month and $179.99 per year. If you own 5 cameras, that’s just $1.15 per month per camera if you choose the Basic plan or $2.98 per month per camera when you the Premium plan is selected.
