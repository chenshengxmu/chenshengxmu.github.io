* Apple is seemingly scrambling to hire a number of key iAd executives in preparation for the launch of its streaming music service iTunes Radio. The Cupertino company is “on a hiring binge,” placing job offers for more than two dozen positions, according to reports Wednesday.
* At the head of Apple’s talent search is for a creative design manager who would oversee rich media ads for such brands as McDonald’s, Pepsi and Proctor & Gamble. The iTunes Radio service is expected to be unveiled September 10 alongside iOS 7…
* “Apple had posted five iAd-related jobs to its own job board and another 35 to LinkedIn just in the month of August as of Friday,” reports Ad Age.
* A key position of iAd Creative Manager was posted August 15 on Apple’s job board, then removed last week without explanation, according to the report.
* Although Apple began iAd with the desire to maintain strict control over the ad design and content, the push for workers experienced with managing high-profile brands may reflect the service’s growing revenue and the number of large advertisers signing onto the iTunes Radio service.
* Such brands have paid “upwards of $10 million to be exclusive iTunes Radio advertisers within their respective industries through the end of 2013,” according to Ad Age.
* The service will have a wider launch at the beginning of 2014.
* Apple’s iAd service is expected to earn $213 million this year, growing to $623 million in 2015. Meanwhile iTunes Radio will reportedly deliver an audio ad every fifteen minutes and a video ad once per hour.
* You’ll need to sign up for the $25 annual iTunes Match service to avoid the ads.
