* A significant number of new Nike Apple Watch band colors are now available for purchase from Nike’s Website, signifying an expansion of the Apple/Nike partnership.
* The four new colors are intended to match that of Nike‘s Air VaporMax Flyknit ‘Day to Night’ shoe lineup, giving users a way to match their tech to their shoes in style.

* Among the different new color choices are:
* Like all Nike Apple Watch Sport bands of the past, these new colors are available online via Nike’s website for $49.00 for both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watches and fit all models. They’re all made from the same sweat-resistant fluoroelastomer material as every other Sport band ever made, so they’re just as comfortable during workouts and everyday life.
* The new Nike bands aren’t available on Apple’s website yet, but some Nike retail stores and authorized re-sellers around the world may also begin carrying the new band colors on their shelves in early June; their availability will be limited to select areas and not available to everyone in this manner.
* Fortunately, there’s no indication that these new Nike Apple Watch bands are limited edition like the NikeLab was. This means you won’t have to rush to buy it ASAP like you had to with the NikeLab.
* As of this writing, many of the new Nike bands for Apple Watch seem to have already sold out of their initial stocks online. Since other sources are expected to begin selling the new bands at a later date this month, stocks should be replenished not too long in the future.
* In the meantime, you can pick up a pair of matching Air Vapormax Flynit shoes for $190 on Nike’s website starting today.
