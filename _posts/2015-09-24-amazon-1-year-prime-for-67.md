* Amazon is currently offering a significant discount on its popular Prime service, cutting the one-year membership fee from $99 to $67. The promotion is in celebration of the company’s 5 Emmy wins earlier this week, and is good through 11:59 p.m. PT Friday night.
* For those unfamiliar with Amazon Prime, the service includes a number of benefits. There’s free 2-day shipping (and same-day in some areas) on millions of products, and free access to Prime Video, Prime Photos, Prime Music and the Kindle Lending Library.
* Prime Video is Amazon’s Netflix-like streaming video service, which allows users to watch a wide range of syndicated TV shows, movies and of course original Amazon content. And Prime Music offers both curated radio stations and millions of on-demand tracks.

* These services alone would be worth the membership price, but Amazon continues to sweeten the deal. With Prime you also get unlimited photo storage via Cloud Drive, and one free rental per month on any Kindle device from a library of over 800,000 books.
* Amazon received its Emmys for its original show Transparent, where actor Jeffrey Tambor took home the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and series creator Jill Soloway won Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, in addition to others.
* Again, the $67 Prime promotion is good from now through 11:59 p.m. (PT) Friday night, and you can take advantage of it here.
