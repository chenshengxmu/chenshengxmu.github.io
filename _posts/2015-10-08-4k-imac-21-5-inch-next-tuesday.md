* Code strings discovered in El Capitan Developer Preview earlier this summer have pointed at a substantial refresh coming to Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac, even more so given that computer wasn’t updated alongside its 27-inch sibling in May 2015.
* A next-generation 21.5-inch iMac with an ultra-sharp screen featuring a glorious 4K resolution is now expected to launch as soon as next Tuesday, as per multiple reliable sources who spoke with 9to5Mac.
* “Apple is currently planning to announce new 21.5-inch iMacs with 4K screens next week,” 9to5Mac wrote two days ago, adding that the new models are “likely ready to begin showing up in stores as soon as Tuesday, October 13.”
* The new all-in-one systems will cost a bit more than the present-generation 21.5-inch model that feature a 1,920-by-1,080 pixel resolution screen. A 4K upgrade will bump up the entry-level iMac’s screen resolution to 4,096-by-2,304 pixels.
* If history is anything to go by, 4K 21.5-inch iMacs should be offered alongside non-4K models. In order to drive four times the pixels, these new iMacs will likely come outfitted with much faster graphics cards and Intel’s latest processors.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said the new iMacs will use an enhanced screen technology designed to provide a “much better display quality” due to the use of a LED phosphor material, known as KSF, to boost color saturation.
* Coincidentally or not, Apple also appears to be refreshing its mouse, keyboard and trackpad lineup soon around Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy connectivity and built-in rechargeable batteries.

* The new keyboard is said to feature backlit keys. The new accessories might also gain support for Force Touch pressure-sensing technology.
* As for the new Apple TV and iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, these gadgets are scheduled to hit retail tories in the first week of November after launching online toward the end of this month, 9to5Mac reported earlier this morning.
