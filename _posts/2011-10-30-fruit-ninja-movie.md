* You’re most likely familiar with the iOS hit game Fruit Ninja, in which your goal is to cut in half a variety of fruits that are being thrown at you while avoiding bombs.
* But did you know that a movie is being made about the game? Well, that’s not actually true. As far as I know, no one is planning to make a movie out of it, but that didn’t prevent SAX Jewell and his friends from creating a Fruit Ninja trailer, and it is hilarious…
* Funny, isn’t it?
