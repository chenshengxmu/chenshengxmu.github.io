* After acquiring virtual headset maker Oculus Rift for $2 billion (the deal got a thumbs-up from feds), Facebook now seems to be moving into the fitness tracking space with news of its latest acquisition, Finnish startup ProtoGeo Oy that created the fitness-tracking app Moves, available free in the App Store.
* The development comes amid some major reshuffling in the fitness and health tracking market.
* For instance, Nike is currently in the process of shuttering its wearable-hardware division that produces FuelBand-branded accessories and there are rumors that the company is collaborating with Apple on a sensor-laden fitness band that would control other devices via gestures…
* According to a media release by Helsini-based Moves, the app will continue to operate as a standalone app, and “there are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook”.
* At the time of this writing, Moves was still available in the App Store.
* Moves notes:
* Today, we’re delighted to announce that Facebook has acquired our company. Since we launched Moves, we’ve been focused on running a simple and clean activity diary that millions of people like you have enjoyed using.
* Now, we’re joining Facebook’s talented team to work on building and improving their products and services with a shared mission of supporting simple, efficient tools for more than a billion people.
* The iOS app, pictured top of post, taps the iPhone 5s’s power efficient M7 motion coprocessor to track your movement in the background and build a profile of your daily activity.
* So, this is now Facebook’s mobile arsenal.

* Helsinki, Finland headquartered ProtoGeo Oy was established in January 2012. Their iOS app launched a year later and has been downloaded four million times to date on iOS and Android devices, prompting Apple to call it a “surprise hit”.
* ProtoGeo raised seed funding from Lifeline Ventures, PROfounders, AJP Holding, Juha Lindfors, Jyri Engeström and Tekes.
* Facebook really hit the ball out of the park with its most recent earnings report, crushing estimates with a first-quarter profit of $642 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a profit of $219 million, or 9 cents a share, for the year-ago period.
* Facebook also said its finance chief David Ebersman was stepping down to be replaced by David Wehner, currently VP for Corporate Finance.
* Facebook most recent engagement stats paint a rosy picture for the firm.

* There are 200 million people using its revamped mobile Messenger software for the iPhone and Android, Zuckerbeg said. Facebook’s other mobile properties are rising fast, too.
* Instagram, for example, now has more than 200 million regular users and its recently-acquired messaging app WhatsApp has just crossed the half-a-billion mark.
* The Facebook service itself now enjoys nearly 1.3 billion monthly active users, or more than Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter combined.
* In other Facebook news, the firm this morning announced a new Facebook Newswire service aimed at stealing journalists from Twitter. The service is powered by Storyful, a tool to discover and verifying newsworthy social media content.
* Facebook Newswire aggregates “newsworthy content shared publicly on Facebook by individuals and organizations” and is available via both a dedicated Facebook Page and a  Twitter account.
