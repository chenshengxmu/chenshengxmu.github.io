* The Consumer Electronics Show is underway this week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yesterday, we shared a few Apple-related CES announcements on iDownloadBlog before realizing there are too many product unveilings happening at the show for us to be able to cover them without cluttering the homepage with CES stuff.
* That’s why we’ve made a decision to run daily roundups of the most important CES announcements you might be interested in, starting with today’s round up of CES 2016.
* iDevices added Siri-controlled wall outlets, switches and light sockets to its HomeKit-enabled lineup, including a device that turns any ordinary light bulb into a smart bulb.
* Honeywell unveiled a HomeKit-compatible Lyric thermostat.
* Hunter Fan Company has announced a pair of Siri-controlled, HomeKit-compatible ceiling fans, the world’s first.
* iHome debuted new HomeKit-compatible products, including an improved version of Wi-Fi-enabled SmartPlug with remote management features and power consumption monitoring; a pair of docking stations with built-in FM radio, Time Sync features and Reson8 speaker chambers; a waterproof rechargeable wireless speaker; an alarm clock, water-resistant earbuds and other Bluetooth accessories.
* Once again, notebook makers have decided that copying the look and feel of Apple’s iconic MacBook is easier than coming up with their own designs.
* Lenovo debuted a 12-inch Yoga 900S convertible laptop with a re-engineered watchband hinge. The machine is just 0.5-inch in profile, weighs in at 2.2 lbs and is available in gold and silver.
* LG claimed the title of the lightest 15-inch notebook ever with the new Gram 15 notebook that’s just 0.6 inches thick and weighs in at 2.16 lbs.

* HP released a new EliteBook Folio Windows 10 laptop with a tapered metallic design. It’s 0.49 inches thick, weighs about 2.2 lbs, runs an Intel Core M processor and has a 12.5-inch screen in 4K resolution at 352 PPI.
* Incipio announced a dual-port USB-C hub, a dock with USB/USB-C/HDMI/ Ethernet ports, car and wall chargers, 8,000mAh/12,000mAh portable batteries and more.
* Seagate debuted four new direct attached storage gadgets, including LaCie-branded Porsche Design 1TB/2TB external hard drives in mobile and desktop editions.
* Incipio unveiled new offGRID Express battery cases for iPhone 6/6s with a 3,000mAh battery and an expanded lineup of Qi wireless charging solutions.
* Incipio launched some new keyboard cases: the ClamCase Pro for iPad mini 4, ClamCase+ for iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, ClamCase+ Power for iPad Air 2 and ClamCase Prompt for iPad Air 2. ClamCases have backlit keyboards and the ClamCase+ Power series offers additional backup battery power for external devices.
* HTC and Under Armor’s HealthBox bundles three devices—a smart scale, a fitness band and a heart-rate monitor—each controlled through an iPhone or Android app. A refreshed Vive virtual-reality headset was also announced, sporting greater control and integrated front-facing camera to merge the physical and virtual.
