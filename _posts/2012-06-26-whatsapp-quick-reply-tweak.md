* Jailbreakers who use the popular WhatsApp messenger will be happy to hear that Delicious, the folks behind biteSMS, have just released a handy new tweak for the client.
* Quick Reply for WhatsApp hit Cydia today. And as you may have guessed, it enables you to quickly reply to incoming WhatsApp messages from anywhere in iOS…
* For those who aren’t familiar with WhatsApp, it’s a cross-platform messaging service with somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 million users. The iOS app will run you $0.99.
* And if you’re using the app, you’ll definitely want to grab Quick Reply. Once installed, you’ll be able to respond to WhatsApp messages from your device’s Lock screen, home screen, etc., via a biteSMS-esque popup window.
* If you’re interested, you can find Quick Reply for WhatsApp in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for free.
* Update: As noted in the comments below, the tweak is actually only free for 7 days. Then it’s $1.99 for a one-year subscription.
