* When you’re looking to make a new iPhone accessory, you generally want to stay away from crowded markets unless you know you have something really special. And that’s exactly what the folks at cellhelment are banking on with its new iPhone case.
* There are already thousands of cases available for Apple’s popular handset, but none of them carry guarantees like this one. Meet the cellhelmet, the first and only iPhone 4/4S case that comes with a free year of smartphone insurance…
* That’s right, each cellhelmet comes with a guarantee that if your iPhone breaks while in the case, the company will repair or replace it for free. Of course, repairs will require shipping your handset off, but the service is unlimited during your one year of coverage. Replacements, on the other hand, are more rare. They’ll only replace your handset one time, and only if they feel it’s absolutely necessary.
* The case is actually fairly thin and is constructed of thermoplastic polyurethane rubber. Cellpig, who is behind the case, describes the material as a hard rubber that won’t stretch or lose its shape. And obviously, if the company is willing to bundle it with a free one-year insurance policy, it’s going to take quite a beating
* Even though the cellhelmet is currently just a Kickstarter project, it’s already been funded and is expected to be in production by March 10th. You can pre-order a case by pledging $40 through the Kickstarter site, or wait for it to hit retail stores for $45.
* What do you think of the cellhelmet?
