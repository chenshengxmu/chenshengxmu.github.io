* State-owned carriers in China have cut LTE cellular access to Apple Watch Series 3, preventing owners of the device from signing up for a cellular connection service.
* “We were informed by China Unicom that the new cellular feature on the Apple Watch Series 3 has been suspended,” Apple said in a statement.
* According to a report Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, the LTE feature was abruptly cut off for new subscribers without explanation. Cellular subscriptions for Apple Watch Series 3 were briefly available at September 22 launch with carrier China Unicom.
* But after September 28, new cellular subscriptions were cut off without explanation. Existing users are not affected at this time.
* According to industry analysts interviewed by the newspaper, the move may have something to do with an embedded SIM, or eSim, that the device uses. eSim effectively prevents third-parties like government agencies from tracking customers that use Apple Watch Series 3.
* “The eSIM (system) isn’t mature enough yet in China,” one analyst said. “The government still needs to figure out how they can control the eSIM.”
* China strictly regulates mobile phones.
* All three major carriers in the country are state-owned companies. Moreover, users are required to register under their real names with a network carrier to get a SIM card for their phone.
