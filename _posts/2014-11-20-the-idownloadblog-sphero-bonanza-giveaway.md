* Christmas might still be a month away but we want to beat Santa Claus to the punch and offer you a chance to get something fun without you having to wait until December 25th. That is why we teamed up with the folks at Orbotix, the company behind the famous Sphero, to offer you a chance to win one of the three connected gadgets we’re putting up for grabs.
* Sphero is this fun little ball that you control directly from your iPhone or iPad. I know for a fact that it drives your kids green with envy, and your pets completely crazy. But that’s ok, because Sphero is completely pet-proof as it’s made of hard plastic that’s virtually indestructible.
* Ollie is the newest addition to the Orbotix family. Just like the Sphero, you can control it from your smartphone or tablet. But because of its shape, Ollie goes where Sphero can only dream of going. It’s perfect for playing on rugged terrains and it can go as fast as 14 mph.
* All you have to do to enter for a chance to win either a Sphero or an Ollie is to visit this page, make sure you read the Terms & Conditions, and fill out the form. You have until December 2nd to enter for a chance to win, so hurry!
* The small prints are all in the Terms & Conditions, which you should definitely read, but note that this giveaway is only opened to US residents. The winners will be contacted on our about December 9th.
* We want to thanks Orbotix for teaming up with us for this awesome giveaway. Good luck, everyone!
* Enter here for a chance to win
