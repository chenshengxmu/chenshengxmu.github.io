* Facebook has released an update for its mobile app this afternoon, bringing the iOS app to version 5.2. The update comes less than two weeks after its big 5.1 update, which included new messaging and photo-sharing features.
* Today’s release includes a few new features as well. Most importantly, Facebook users will now be able to repost and share stories right from their news feeds, kind of like how you can retweet something in Twitter…
* Here’s the change log:
* • New Share link to re-post stories from your news feed • Tag your friends in any post, comment or photo • Smileys, hearts and other emoji in messages • To sort your feed, tap the button next to News Feed in the left sidebar
* In addition to the new sharing feature, you can now tag your friends in any post, comment or photo, and you can also now add emoji icons to your messages right from within the app.
* As usual, if you already have the Facebook app, you can find the new version in the App Store under the Updates tab. If you don’t already have it, you can download it by clicking here.
* Have you updated to Facebook 5.2 yet? How are you liking the new features?
