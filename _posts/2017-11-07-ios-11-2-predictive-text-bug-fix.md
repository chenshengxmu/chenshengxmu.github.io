* iOS 11.2 beta 2 includes a fix for the predictive text bug where typing the letter “i” can replace it with the uppercase letter “A” and a question mark symbol.
* UPDATE: the iOS 11.1.1 software update, released on November 9, has fixed the bug.
* According to MacRumors forum posts, some people have noticed that a fix for the issue is appearing in the second beta of iOS 11.2, which was released to developers yesterday.
* An Apple spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that an update squashing this bug “will be included in this week’s public and developer beta releases.”
* “A fix will be released very soon,” an Apple spokeswoman said. “It will be included in this week’s public and developer beta releases, with wide rollout to follow.”
* The initial iOS 11.2 public beta has been available for a week now, but the new public beta matching the developer-only iOS 11.2 beta 2 release is expected to follow soon. In a support document published yesterday, Apple pinned the problem on the newly released iOS 11.1 and suggested a temporary workaround.
* First, you need to go to Settings → General → Keyboard → Text Replacement. Then, tap “+” in the upper-left corner and enter “I” in the phrase field and “i” in the shortcut field. Tap Save to finish making changes then do the opposite: add “i” for the phrase and “I” for the shortcut.
* Apple now says the bug could also appear in earlier versions of iOS 11.
* Have you noticed this bug at all?
* Let us know in the comments!
