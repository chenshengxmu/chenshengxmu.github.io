* Since the jailbreak community formed sometime in late 2007, we’ve seen a number of “App Store alternatives.” I can think of Icy, Cydia, Rock Your iPhone, and Installer just off the top of my head.
* Now it looks like we could soon be adding another option into the mix: iTweak. The new store describes itself as a ‘Cydia alternative’ where jailbreakers will be available to find all of their favorite tweaks, themes and utilities…
* iTweakStore.com just went live with a ‘Coming Soon’ banner, and the following message:
* “Welcome to iTweak! iTweak is one of the best places to get all of your Tweaks, Themes, Utilities and more on your jailbroken iPhone, iPod touch and iPad! We serve as an alternative to Cydia, and the Apple App Store.”
* We’ve seen a number of promising Cydia challengers over the years that never managed to materialize, so for now we’re remaining skeptical. But if these guys can really deliver on their claims of a “fast, powerful, and easy to use” jailbreak store, we’re all for it.
* There doesn’t seem to be any word on when iTweak will be open for business, but as always we’ll be sure to keep you up to date as the story develops.
* What do you think of iTweak so far? Do we really need a Cydia alternative?
