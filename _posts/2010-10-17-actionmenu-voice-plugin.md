title: ActionMenu Voice Plugin Lets Your iPhone Really Speak Its Mind
---
* Sometimes it seems as if the iPhone truly has a mind of its own, and now with the latest plugin for ActionMenu, your iPhone can speak its mind as well.  Who needs to read all of the time anyway?  ActionMenu Voice plugin gets rid of the need to read by making transcribing quick, easy, and effortless.
* Okay, so I was being facetious about the reading part. Reading’s great, in fact we highly recommend it here at iDB, but it is cool to know that the option to transcribe is right at your fingertips.  And you know what the best part about all of this is?  It won’t cost you a dime.

* Being free is just one of the best parts about ActionMenu Voice.  The really great thing about this plugin, is that it’s app independent, just like ActionMenu itself.  That means that it’ll work universally among all apps.  And because it runs as a Mobile Substrate add-on, it’s always available, and doesn’t require any effort from the end user.
* To transcribe some text, all you do is open the copy and paste menu like normally, and tap the lips icon (if you have icon support enabled) to make your iPhone start to chatter. You can also select specific text that you want to transcribe in order to prevent your iPhone from rambling like a phone that’s had one too many.
* One last cool thing about ActionMenu Voice, is that you can transcribe your text into nearly 30 different dialects, from English to Japanese, via the Settings app.
* ActionMenu Voice is a plugin available only for jailbroken iPhones, and can be downloaded via Cydia. Give it a try and let us know what you think.
