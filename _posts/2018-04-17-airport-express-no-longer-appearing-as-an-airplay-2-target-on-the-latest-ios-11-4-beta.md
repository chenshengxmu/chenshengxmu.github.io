* Looks like AirPort Express may not be getting a suspected AirPlay 2 upgrade after all.
* Even though it did pop up in the Home app on the first iOS 11.4 beta, the portable wireless base station no longer shows up as an AirPlay 2 target there for users on the latest iOS 11.4 beta.
* As noted earlier today by Andrew O’Hara of AppleInsider, the Wi-Fi base station can no longer be found in the Home app on devices running the latest iOS 11.4 beta 2 software.
* It’s unclear if AirPort Express will gain AirPlay 2 compatibility in the future.

* AirPlay 2 brings support for multi-room audio control, the ability to stream audio to multiple AirPlay 2 devices at the same time, lower latency and higher throughput.
* Compatible speaker or Hi-Fi receiver with built-in support for AirPlay 2 is required. For those wondering, HomePod still appears as an AirPlay 2 target in the Home app on iOS 11.4 beta 2.
* It isn’t unusual to see certain features in iOS betas come and go as Apple postpones or delays their implementation due to unforeseen bugs or other reasons. As an example, features like Messages in iCloud and AirPlay 2 were supposed to arrive alongside the initial iOS 11 release last September but instead got delayed multiple times.
