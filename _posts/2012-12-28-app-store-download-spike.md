* Given the fact that millions of iPhones, iPads and iPod touches were given as gifts this year, and that a number of apps and games were on sale, it’s no surprise that there was a huge spike in app downloads on Tuesday.
* In fact, app analytics firm Distimo found that daily downloads in the App Store increased by 87% on Christmas Day compared to the December 2012 average. So what was everyone downloading? Read on to find out…
* According to Distimo’s data, the top 10 most popular apps (in 40 countries) on Tuesday were:
* 1. YouTube
* 2. Google Maps
* 3. ElfYourself by OfficeMax
* 4. Where’s My Holiday?
* 5. Skype for iPad
* 6. Subway Surfers
* 7. Flow Free
* 8. Furby
* 9. Instagram
* 10. Emoji & Unicode Icons – Special Symbols For Messages & Email
* Numbers 1 and 2 aren’t really surprising, as they were once stock iOS apps. Skype at number five and Instagram at number nine aren’t shockers either. But the other apps are kind of a toss up — there’s a few there I’ve never used.
* Distimo also found another interesting statistic: iPad downloads and revenues rose by a staggering 140% and 83% respectively on Christmas day, suggesting that the iPad was a very popular gift this holiday season. A quick look at Twitter confirms this, as Apple’s tablet was a trending topic for much of the day.
* At any rate, did you get a new iOS device for the holidays? What were the first apps you downloaded?
