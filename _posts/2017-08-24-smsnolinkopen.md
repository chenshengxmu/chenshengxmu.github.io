* Sometimes people send you links to websites in the Messages app, and while most are legitimate, you might also end up with spammers sending you malicious links.
* You can never be too careful with a jailbroken iPhone, and a new free jailbreak tweak called SMSNoLinkOpen by iOS developer CydiaGeek prevents you from launching links via the Messages app with just a tap.
* At first thought, it probably sounds like a hindrance to link-opening, but the tweak doesn’t completely stop you from visiting a website someone sends to you.
* Instead, it just prevents you from launching the link directly through the Messages app with a tap and being redirected to a potentially-malicious source, which helps protect against inadvertent taps or negligence.
* You can still copy and paste the link into Safari manually, which gives you a moment to review the URL before you load the website. From a security perspective, this is much better than having an automatic redirect from the time you tap on the link.
* To double-check the URL and to copy/paste it, you can tap and hold on the link on non-3D Touch devices, or use a 3D Touch gesture on capable devices to get the following peek-and-pop menu:

* Here, you can view the URL and copy it so you can paste it manually inside of Safari. If you see a URL you don’t trust, it’s just as easy to back out of the menu without loading the website.
* SMSNoLinkOpen doesn’t come with any options to configure, so it takes effect immediately after installation. If you care about your security, then you might want to give the tweak a try.
* SMSNoLinkOpen can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
