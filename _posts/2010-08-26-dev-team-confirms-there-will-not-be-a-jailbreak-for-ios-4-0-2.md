* The Dev Team confirmed earlier today in a blog post that they will not be releasing a jailbreak for iOS 4.0.2. The last jailbreak released was JailbreakMe, which allowed a quick and easy jailbreak directly from the Safari browser, taking advantage of a security hole in the way PDF documents were handled. The patch has now been fixed by Apple with the recent release of iOS 4.0.2.
* FW 4.0.2/3.2.2 was *only* released to fix the jailbreakme hole. With FW 4.1 still in its beta stages, it makes no sense to escalate the “cat & mouse” with Apple for FW updates that only fix the jailbreak holes. To quote WOPR, “the only winning move is not to play”.
* If the cat & mouse game escalates too quickly, especially during beta FW periods, nobody but Apple benefits. For this reason, there won’t be a 4.0.2/3.2.2 jailbreak specifically during the period where 4.0.2/3.2.2 is the latest public release. At best, some future 4.1x FW jailbreak *may* be compatible with 4.0.2/3.2.2 (but don’t count on that).
* So if you were holding your breath for a 4.0.2 jailbreak, you’re going to have to keep waiting. In the meantime, if you accidentally updated to 4.0.2 and want to go back to 4.0.1 or iOS 4, you can follow these instructions to downgrade your iPhone.
