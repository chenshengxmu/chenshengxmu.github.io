* Apple on Tuesday released the first beta of iOS 10.2 to public testers. The software comes just a day after it was seeded to developers, and a week after iOS 10.1 was released to the public. You can install the new beta via the OTA update mechanism in the Settings app.
* As discovered in yesterday’s developer beta, iOS 10.2 contains a number of user-facing changes. There is over 100 new [Unicode 9] emoji, a new Preserve Settings option for saving your Camera app settings, new wallpapers, and a new widget for the stock Videos app.
* If you’d like to try out today’s 10.2 beta, you can sign up for Apple’s public testing program here.
