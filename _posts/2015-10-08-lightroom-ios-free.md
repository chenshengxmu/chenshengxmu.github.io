* Since its April 2014 debut, Adobe’s Lightroom mobile app has required you to subscribe to Adobe’s Cloud service in order to use the app, but not any longer. As first noted by The Next Web, both Lightroom for iPhone and Lightroom for iPad are now available for everyone without the desktop app, without a Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription and even without an Adobe ID.
* “We’re seeing a lot of people come in first on Lightroom mobile, so now we’re allowing people to use it locally on their local assets, their local photos and videos on their phone and tablet for as long as they like,” Tom Hogarty, Adobe’s director of product management for digital imaging told the publication.
* The software lets you manage, edit and organize your photos. Lightroom supports editing of RAW DSLR photos and comes with a bunch of filters and various selection and editing tools.
* Lightroom for iOS was recently updated with a built-in camera feature for taking photos directly from the app, a new Dehaze filter, a new Target Adjustment option in the Color/B&W tool, a photos collection feature that displays your Camera Roll photos and videos by date and more.
* Photoshop Fix, Adobe’s new mobile application, is integrated with Lightroom for mobile through the CreativeSync feature. Last but not least, Adobe’s refreshed Lightroom web app lets you edit your photos in a web browser. A Creative Cloud account is required to share photos between Lightroom’s mobile and web editions.
* “More and more people are adopting the phone as their primary camera, taking the DSLR out less and less, and we’re seeing the same thing with the use of Lightroom. Some users are creative pros who are aiming for efficiency, but many others are just consumers who love photography,” Hogarty said.
* Lightroom requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.1 or later and is localized in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish.
* Grab Lightroom for iPhone and iPod touch and Lightroom for iPad in the App Store.
* You can now optionally choose to sign up for a Creative Cloud Photography Plan trial in order to use Lightroom for mobile. Before today, downloading Lightroom immediately started a 30-day trial for the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan.
