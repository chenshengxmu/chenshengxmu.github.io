* The ability to forward traditional SMS messages between the Mac and the iPhone is another huge feature to make its way to OS X Yosemite. Now that iOS 8.1 is publicly available, everyone can take advantage of this awesome new feature.
* SMS Forwarding essentially makes it possible to turn the Messages app on your Mac into a full-fledged text messaging app. Not only can you compose SMS messages and stay in touch with your non-iMessage using friends, you can receive messages as well. Have a look at our video walkthrough for more details on this awesome new feature.
* Just as a reminder, you must be running OS X Yosemite and iOS 8.1 to use Text Message Forwarding. iOS 8.1 released earlier today, so make sure that your iPhone is running it before proceeding. You’ll also need to make sure that you have hardware that meets Apple’s Continuity requirements.
* To enable Text Message Forwarding, you must be logged in to the Messages app with the same iCloud account on your iPhone and Mac. You must also ensure that Text Message Forwarding is enabled for your Mac via Settings → Messages → Text Message Forwarding on the iPhone. Before you can start texting, you’ll need to verify your Mac via a one-time-use verification code.
* Once you have everything set up properly, you’ll be able to both send and receive normal SMS messages via your Mac. SMS messages are denoted by the green bubbles that appear in the Messages app, while iMessages retain their blue hue.
* What do you think about Text Message Forwarding? Is it as big of a deal to you as it is to me?
