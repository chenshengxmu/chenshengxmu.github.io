* Evidence continues to mount suggesting that Apple’s AMOLED-based iPhone 8 flagship aka “iPhone Edition” may in fact launch later in the fourth quarter of 2017, unlike the refreshed LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus that should hit store shelves shortly following an announcement in September.
* Citing industry sources, DigiTimes reported Tuesday that touch panel maker TPK Holding won’t begin churning out next-generation 3D Touch sensors for use in iPhone 8 before the fourth quarter of 2017.
* It’s been noted before that a shift to the superior active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display technology would necessitate a thin-film solution for iPhone 8’s 3D Touch module, with production cost estimated to rise from about $9 for the existing glass-based 3D Touch sensor to more than $15 for its thin film counterpart.
* As AMOLEDs will require an add-on touch module, iPhone 8’s redesigned 3D Touch will be pricier to build than before. TPK will become a second provider next to Nissha Printing, initially supplying 10-20 percent of demand for thin-film touch sensors with Nissha Printing estimated to provide 80-90 percent.
* Supplier General Interface Solution may land more orders for 3D Touch modules, too.
* KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo estimated production cost of iPhone 8’s reengineered 3D Touch solution may increase by up to $5 per unit. The new sensor should improve sensitivity and support a wider range of pressure levels, said Kuo.
* Both TPK Holding and General Interface Solutions are dropping big bucks on next-generation factories to retain the precision that Apple demands, with the former spending about $152 million and the latter $163 million.
