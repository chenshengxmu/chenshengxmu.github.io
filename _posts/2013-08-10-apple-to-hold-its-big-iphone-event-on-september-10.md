* Apple will take the wraps off of its next generation iPhone, believed to be the iPhone 5S, on September 10, according to a new report from The WSJ-owned AllThingsD. The blog says that sources have confirmed the company is planning a media event for the date.
* While we haven’t seen near the amount of “leaked” parts for the new iPhone as we have for the rumored budget model or the iPad 5, we still think we have a pretty good idea what to expect: a familiar-looking device with internal upgrades and an improved camera…
* AllThingsD’s Ina Fried has the scoop on the event:
* “Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone at a special event on Sept. 10, sources told AllThingsD. The launch comes at an important time for Apple, which continues to make a lot of money from the iPhone but has seen its global market share dip amid a growing wave of lower-cost Android devices as well as an intense battle with archrival Samsung.”
* The report matches up with previous speculation that Apple is going to hold an iPhone event next month, based on the company’s fourth- quarter guidance. It’s also worth noting that last year’s iPhone event was in early September, and Apple tends to favor Tuesdays.
* As for what to expect from the event, we’re not exactly sure. Obviously, the new iPhone will be there with its faster processor, better camera with dual-LED flash, and supposedly a built-in fingerprint sensor. But will any other products join the flagship handset on stage?
* Considering how much chatter there’s been involving a lower cost iPhone, and all of the alleged parts we’ve seen, it’s hard to imagine it not being on stage at the event. Expect the device to appear in plastic, in a variety of colors, with a price tag around the $300 mark.
* Anything else? We’ll just have to wait an see. Mark your calendars folks, September 10 is just a month away.
