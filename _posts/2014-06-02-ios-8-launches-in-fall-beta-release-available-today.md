* Apple announced that iOS 8 will be available today as a beta for registered developers, while a full public release is slated for the Fall. The beta is available now through Developer Center for registered iOS developers. The software update will be free for compatible devices, which is the iPhone 4S or later, iPad 2 or later, iPad mini or later and fifth-generation iPod touch. In order to have access to the beta version, you must be signed up for Apple’s iOS Developer Program… 
* “iOS 8 offers simpler, faster and more intuitive ways to use your device with incredible new features like iCloud Photo Library, a new Messages app, the QuickType keyboard and an entirely new Health app,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We’re also giving developers amazing new tools to make managing your health and your home from your devices an integrated, simple and secure experience.”
* iOS 8 contains several new features, ranging from QuickType and support for third-party keyboards to Family Sharing and a more intelligent Spotlight search. A number of stock apps also received improvements, including Mail and Safari. We’ll be covering the software update more thoroughly throughout the next few hours, and in the days ahead, so keep it locked on our iOS 8 section for the latest coverage.
