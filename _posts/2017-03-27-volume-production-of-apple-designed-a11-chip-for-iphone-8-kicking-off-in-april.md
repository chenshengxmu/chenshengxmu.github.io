* Apple’s favorite chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is about to kick off volume production of a new Apple-designed A11 chip widely expected to serve as the engine for new iOS devices this year, including an all-new iPhone 8 with an OLED display and the iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus with LCD screens.
* According to Economic Daily News, cited by DigiTimes, the A11 chips will be fabbed on TSMC’s ten-nanometer FinFET manufacturing process with a wafer-level integrated fan-out technology, resulting in smaller, faster chips that consume less power.
* TSMC will churn out 100 million A11 chips by the end of this year and is preparing a capacity for production of 50 million A11 units before July, as previously reported.

* Moving to a smaller process technology will yield speed boost and lower power consumption. That’s because as the individual transistors get positioned closer together, the electrons travel a shorter distance. Smaller process technologies also result in smaller dies, helping reduce a chip’s thermal output.
* By way of comparison, iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip is being manufactured on TSMC’s sixteen-nanometer FinFET process. Thanks to strong sales of the iPhone 7 series, the A10 contract has helped TSMC post record profits.
* On a related note, the semiconductor foundry is expected to make the decision on building a $16 billion chip factory in the United States sometime in 2018.
