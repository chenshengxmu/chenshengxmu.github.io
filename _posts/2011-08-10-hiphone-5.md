* Why wait for the iPhone 5 when you can get your hands on an HiPhone 5, right now, for a fraction of the price of a real iPhone 5. And where else but China could you get one of those? On a Chinese auction website, of course.
* According to Reuters, the HiPhone 5 was made reflecting the upcoming iPhone 5’s rumored design features, such as the slimmed-down design and the rounded edges…
* At about $40, you can’t expect much from this device. I bet you’ll be lucky if you get it to place a call.
* Who’s buying this?
