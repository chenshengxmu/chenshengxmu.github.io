* Whenever I’m using my MacBook Pro, there are a number of third-party accessories I like to use to glorify my user experience based on what I may be using it for. In this piece, I’ll share with you my five favorite accessories that I use with my 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display regularly.

* For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a huge audiophile. I love quality sound, and the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speaker system, which can be had from Amazon for $150 has been my best friend for years, and still is to this day.
* This THX-certified speaker setup plugs right into the 3.5mm headphone jack on the side of my MacBook Pro and comes with a nice subwoofer that delivers those really low tones you want to hear during movies, music, and games. Even better, you can adjust the volume of the speakers and subwoofer box independently, which gives you fine control over just how rumbly your sounds are going to be.
* I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these speakers, apart from the fact that there are a lot of wires, and they’re perfect for just about everything I do. Low rumbly bass, crisp clear treble, and loud clear mids make this speaker setup a real bargain for the price.

* A lot of modern portable Macs lack a CD/DVD drive because Apple is building them with slimness in mind. With that being said, when I want to watch a movie with my smart TV via an HDMI connection, I had no way to watch them without buying a standalone DVD player.
* My choice was to go with a USB external CD/DVD drive by Samsung, because it had the highest ratings of all the external CD/DVD drives I had to pick from at the time. Although my model can be had on Amazon for $35, the company has since launched a newer ultra-slim model, which can be had on Amazon for $21.
* Although I can’t vouch for the reliability of the new slim drive, I can say that the original model has a lot of miles on it and it’s still kicking alive and strong to this day. It’s a great reliable CD/DVD drive and I take it anywhere I go where I think I’ll be watching movies.

* I go a lot of places with my MacBook Pro, and has a result, protection is a must. I wanted a case of some sort that would allow me to travel with it without letting it get all banged up by the commute, and the Incipio Asher, which can be had on Amazon for $38, is a good fit for me.
* With its durable nylon exterior, soft faux interior, and spacious storage compartment, the Incipio Asher sleeve is a great bargain. It has a wonderful sense of style, and best of all, it has all the padding and protection you need to keep your computer safe from bumps, drops, and scrapes while you carry it in your hands or in a backpack while out and about.
* The pocket on the front is perfect for bringing the AC adapter and any small USB accessories that I may want to bring along on any trip, and everything just zips up nicely for a snug and secure fit.

* For those times when I’m out and about and I need some extra juice for my MacBook Pro, I turn to BatteryBox, which can be had on Amazon for $220. The Intel core i7 processor in this notebook is incredibly power hungry, and coming from a 13-inch computer, the 15-inch gets significantly worse battery life.
* With BatteryBox, I can extend my Mac’s battery life by up to two additional hours, depending on what I’m doing. It’s useful because it connects right to the MagSafe port without cycling the Mac’s battery, and instead, the Mac will drain BatteryBox before the computer switches to battery power.
* With a powerful 16 watt-hour battery tucked away inside, this compact portable battery is quite the dense little powerhouse, and it doubles as an iPhone charger as well.

* Admittedly I’m a little bit of a Battlefield addict. I run Windows on a Bootcamp partition, and after upgrading to the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display last year, I made sure to get the model that came with the upgraded video card so I could enjoy some decent gaming.
* Complimenting my gaming experience on my Mac is the Redragon M901 Perdition 16400 DPI gaming mouse, which can be had on Amazon for $36 and is about the best-priced gaming mouse on the market that still has all of the features you’d expect from a high-end gaming mouse.
* The Redragon M901 Perdition has programmable macro buttons, and you can set its tracking rate to anything you feel fit depending on the way you game. Moreover, the mouse comes with little metal weights so you can control how much the mouse weighs for the perfect glide across your mouse pad.
* With its high-quality braided cable and rough grippy surface, the mouse is highly durable and unlikely to break. I’ve been beating pretty hard on it for a few months and the thing still looks like it’s brand new. I’d highly recommend this mouse to any gamer – Mac or PC user.
* These are the five accessories I use the most with my Mac, but everyone’s tastes in accessories are going to be different because everyone uses their computers differently. Nevertheless, my hope is you’ll look at my list and hopefully find something interesting that you could use for your machine.
