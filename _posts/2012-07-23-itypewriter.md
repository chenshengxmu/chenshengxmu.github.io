* Who doesn’t love the sound of a good typewriter? There’s something about the keys, something about the sound, that’s just soothing to the ear.
* Relive yesteryear thanks to iTypeWriter — a jailbreak tweak that allows you to enable both haptic feedback and classic typewriter sounds (ding!) for $0.99 on Cydia.
* The haptic feedback and typewriter sounds can be enabled together, or independently of one another. That makes this a decent tweak for those seeking only haptic feedback as well.
* Be sure to disable keyboard click sounds in the Settings app before trying to use iTypeWriter, or else you might not hear the typewriter inspired sound effects.
* Again, you can find iTypeWriter on Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $0.99. It’s not for everyone, and eventually you’ll likely grow tired of the sound effects, but even then it’s still an okay conversation piece.
* Be sure to let me know what you think about iTypeWriter in the comments below.
