* Any time Apple uses specific images to highlight their new products, we scramble to find copies. For example, go ahead and grab our iPhone 7 marketing wallpapers, from the Apple website. In addition, Apple used what appears to be amorphous droplets in a variety of colors to highlight the iPhone 7, but neglected to put them in the iOS 10 GM.
* Thankfully, with the release of iOS 10.2 beta 1, the wallpapers are now included. If you do not have a dev account and the latest beta, you will be waiting for the images. Additionally, these wallpapers appear to be available only for iPhone 7, so this might be your only chance to get your hands on them if you don’t have the latest device.

* You can download variations of this wallpapers in yellow, red, and blue.
* According to 9to5Mac, the wallpapers were extracted directly from the beta. The large, square files should make for great wallpapers on iPhone or iPad.

* Thanks to a tip from Twitter, @jazielbaca, you can also have these wallpapers set as Live wallpapers on devices with 3D Touch. Using the app Black Lite – Live Wallpapers, you can download live versions of these wallpapers in yellow, red, blue, and green.  The app prompts users to download the Live wallpaper to Camera Roll. Then, from the Photos or Settings app, set the image as a Live wallpaper. Like the stock Live wallpapers, simply 3D Touch the image to animate!
* The images are not quite photo quality, but we have been frequently asked how to make these animate on iOS devices. Thanks for the tip!
