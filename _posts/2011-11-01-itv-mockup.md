* Over the past couple of weeks, speculation around an Apple-flavored TV set has dramatically amplified. Between Steve Jobs’ “I cracked it” comment and a TV market that seems ripe for the picking, the time feels right for Apple to move in.
* Word on the street is that the company is so serious about entering the television space that it already has a working prototype of a TV set. Obviously we won’t get to see the product until it’s finished, but we can look at this gorgeous concept…
* Popular iDevice mockup artist Guilherme M. Schasiepen has created several renderings of what he believes Apple’s television could look like. The “iTV” set is expected to have game-changing features that would set it apart from the competition.

* For starters, pundits believe that Apple’s TV set will have Siri built-in. This way, users could easily control their TVs with voice commands. The set is also rumored to have standard iOS features like FaceTime, iCloud support, and App Store access.

* Nobody knows for sure when or if Apple will release its own television. But if it looks anything like the above concept, we’re sold.
* What do you think of this iTV concept?
