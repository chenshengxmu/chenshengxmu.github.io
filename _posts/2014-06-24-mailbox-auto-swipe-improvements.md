* Dropbox-owned Mailbox has introduced Auto-swipe two and a half months ago with much fanfare. The feature has been designed to learn from your usage patterns, so that the app could help you save time by automating email management to a certain degree.
* You Auto-swipe settings are kept in sync across devices thanks to Dropbox integration and now the team is building on top of that with additional improvements.
* Now bumped to version 2.0.3, Mailbox includes several enhancements to the Auto-swipe feature, including a quicker way of creating Auto-swipe patterns, Auto-swipe suggestions in email view and more…
* The key takeaway in this Dropbox update is a brand new swipe-and-hold gesture allowing you to swipe a message once to file away all messages like it, which is basically a quicker way of creating new auto-swipe patterns.
* Mailbox 2.0.3 changelog:
* In a nod at Mailbox’s swiping-based interface, Apple’s Mail app in iOS 8 and other stock apps like Messages have adopted Mailbox-like swiping.
* This lets you, say, swipe individual items in Mail/Messages or Lock screen notifications to reveal a menu with options to delete the message, mark it as read/unread and more.
* Download Mailbox free in the App Store.
* The universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iO 7.0 or later.
