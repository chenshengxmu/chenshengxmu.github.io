* TaiG has updated its iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool to fix a security issue, but as of now, that update is no longer available on its website or via Cydia. TaiG 2.2.2, which includes a setreuid patch to prevent applications from obtaining to root privileges through setreuid, was deemed unsafe by saurik. With this in mind, please don’t upgrade.
* Here’s saurik’s comment on the release:
* OK, so this is a pretty serious issue: the new patch that TaiG built just doesn’t work :/. I wish they would calm down and let me do this correctly. I’ve pulled their update.
* Needless to say, the package was pulled from Cydia, and no longer shows up on TaiG’s website as well. I’m sure they are working on fixing whatever issues saurik spotted with the update.
* Stay tuned, we’ll update you once a safe package reappears.
* Update: the new version has been released with bug fixes.
