* iOS 4 will be released in just a few hours and depending on your setup, there are a few steps you should take to ensure that you and your iPhone are ready for the latest software update.
* 1. Make sure YOU are ready
* If you jailbreak/unlock your iPhone, you have to understand there won’t be a jailbreak or unlock out at least for a few days. If you rely on your jailbreak/unlock, don’t update to iOS 4 yet.
* 2. Make sure your device is compatible
* 3. Update iTunes to 9.2
* In order to download and install iOS 4, you will need to have the latest version of iTunes.
* 4. Sync and backup your iPhone
* Before hitting the “update” button, make sure to sync and backup your iPhone. If something goes wrong, you’ll always be able to revert back to your old settings.
* 5. Make sure you know what your jailbreak apps are
* Before updating to a newer OS, I always take screenshots of what apps are installed on Cydia, as well as all my sources. Taking screenshots is much quicker than writing down the name of all your apps and sources.
* 6. Keep your App Store apps in order
* Just like I do for jailbreak apps, I take a screenshot of every page of apps on my springboard. This allows me to remember in what order these apps are installed. Once my iPhone is updated, I make sure the apps on the first page of the springboard are in the same order as prior to the update.
* 7. Restore, don’t update!
* This one can be a bit controversial. Usually people prefer “updating” their iPhone rather than “restoring” in order to keep all the settings in place. It’s fine if you run a stock OS. However, if your iPhone is jailbroken, I suggest you restore and set up as a new phone. Sure you will have to set up your iPhone all over again, but it’s a good way to make sure the upgrade to iOS 4 doesn’t bring unwanted parts of your jailbreak.
* 8. Seek help in the forum
* If you have any problem during or after the update, you can find help in our iPhone forum. Simply create a new thread there and the community will be here to help.
* 9. Check back here again
* If you’re a jailbreaker, make sure to check back iDB on a regular basis to find out when the new jailbreak is available. For up-to-date information, subscribe to the RSS feed, become a fan on Facebook, or follow me on Twitter.
