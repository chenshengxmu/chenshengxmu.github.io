* As you know, Apple has not yet opened up the iPhone’s virtual keyboard to developers so you can’t just go into the App Store and replace the stock iOS keyboard with a custom one, like on Android.
* But where some see failures, others like Fleksy see opportunities. For those unfamiliar with Fleksy, it’s the first alternate keyboard with gestures available to third-party developers across the entire iOS ecosystem.
* Also available on Android, Fleksy Keyboard has seen over a million cumulative downloads across platforms, with about half of the downloads coming from iOS.
* Following a 2.0 release on Android earlier this year, today Fleksy Keyboard has been bumped to version 3.1, featuring a completely revamped user interface, six new UI themes and more…
* The all-new look and feel has been conceived to expose functionality and create a better user experience that “complements the increased availability of Fleksy in other apps,” the team underscores in iTunes release notes accompanying the 50.2MB universal download.
* The app includes a brand new tutorial section and another one dedicated to support where you can send your feedback to developers.
* You’ll also notice some major accessibility updates.
* Additional bug fixes and performance improvements round up the list of changes in Fleksy Keyboard 3.1.

* On the downside, app developers don’t get the Fleksy keyboard automatically.
* Instead, they need to sign up for the official SDK (released last December) and then implement the feature. Only a handful of iPhone and iPad apps feature Fleksy Keyboard integration, among them Launch Center Pro.
* According to Fleksy founder and COO Ioannis Verdelis, Fleksy Keyboard for iOS
* We get about half our downloads from iOS, a platform our competitors have publicly criticized as doomed for failure for third party keyboards.
* Our success shows that iOS is a genuine opportunity for really innovative keyboard technologies, and today’s major update is the first step of us doubling down our efforts on this platform.
* As much as I’d want Apple to open up more of iOS to third-party developers more quickly, including the keyboard subsystem, we’ll just have to wait and see what the future holds.
* Here’s a quick video walkthrough of Fleksy Keyboard.
* Best thing you try out Fleksy Keyboard for yourself – it’s free in the App Store.
* If you’re jailbroken, you can overcome the limitations of iOS by installing a new jailbreak tweak called Fleksy Enabler which will enable the Fleksy Keyboard in stock apps.
