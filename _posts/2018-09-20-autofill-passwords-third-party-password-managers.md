* The release of iOS 12 includes many new, terrific features. You can take a look at our article on all of those features and how to use them. But in this piece, we’re going to concentrate on the updated AutoFill Passwords feature that now lets you use third-party password manager apps.
* This convenient update means that if you use an app to manage your passwords that has been updated to integrate with this feature, you can access those passwords to log in quickly. For apps like Safari, Facebook, Amazon, and others, this lets you pop your credentials in with a tap.
* Here’s how to enable and use the AutoFill Passwords feature with third-party password managers.
* 1) Open your device Settings.
* 2) Scroll to and tap Passwords & Accounts.
* 3) Select AutoFill Passwords.
* 4) Tap the slider to enable AutoFill Passwords.
* Here you will see supported password manager apps in the list along with iCloud Keychain.
* Tap to allow your password manager app to use this feature and optionally deselect iCloud Keychain.

* When you open an app that does not keep you logged in and you must enter your username or email and your password, the AutoFill Passwords feature kicks in.
* Using Instagram as an example, when you open the app and tap to enter your credentials, you should see your password manager app login details right in the QuickType bar at the top of your keyboard. Just tap and your information will populate right in.

* Other apps may work differently, especially if you keep iCloud Keychain enabled along with your password manager.
* For instance, when logging into Microsoft Outlook, tap the Password indicator in the QuickType bar. Then, you will see both iCloud Keychain and your password manager options. Select the one you want and, again, your credentials will pop in.

* The updated AutoFill Passwords feature gives you a quick and easy way to log in to your favorite social media, shopping, email, and other types of apps that you use with your password manager.
* Just a few of the password apps that have been updated so far to integrate with the feature include 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass, mSecure, Keeper Password Manager, and OneSafe 4.
* This is nice, handy new part of iOS 12 that takes the security you trust with your password manager app and integrates it so that you can log in to apps and sites quickly. Have you tried the new feature yet and if so, what are your thoughts on it?
