* The app offers features such as Night mode, Burst mode, anti-shake, and a self-timer. It also has face detection, intelligent HDR, dozens of photo filters to choose from, and a variety of other tools that make taking and editing great photos and videos a breeze.
* Additionally, ProCam 2 has an iOS 8 extension that allows you to take advantage of its editing tools from with the stock Photos app. There is also an in-app purchase available ($4.99) that allows you to capture 4K Ultra HD video (only for iPhone 5s or later).
* The app has a 4.5 star rating on over 1,500 reviews in the App Store, and is very well designed, so even if you don’t consider yourself a photographer, it’s worth grabbing for free.
