* If you’d like a little more scares in your everyday life, why not put a ghost on it. Take photos of your friends, family, and pets and toss a creepy character in the background to turn a happy snapshot into a frightening photo. The eraser mode lets you remove sections of the effect so that it looks like the ghost is peaking out from behind you. You can also add your own ghost effects from your photo library for an unlimited number of scares. This app is available for free.
