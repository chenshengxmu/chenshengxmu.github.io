* Case maker Incipio two weeks ago announced its new iPhone case, the Cashwrap. It brings mobile wallet functionality to the iPhone 4/4s/5/5s by incorporating NFC technology. The case is compatible with the carrier-backed Isis Mobile Wallet app which makes it possible to pay with your device at participating retailers, mass transit systems and more, using an Iris account.
* AT&T initially rolled out the Cashwrap to its own retail stores and yesterday the accessory became available to order in Verizon stores nationwide and from the Big Red carrier’s online store…
* According to Incipio, the Cashwrap case is the only NFC mobile solution for the iPhone 5/5s. Verizon customers can order it through the Verizon web store, in black only, in exchange for $69.
* A new Isis Mobile Wallet for Verizon is available free in the App Store.
* The case works with the iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and 5s, but the iPhone 5c surprisingly isn’t supported at this time.
* It’s a case – and a wallet. Mobile wallet cases protect your smartphone from drops and dents, and can replace a wallet’s worth of credit and debit cards. With a safeguarded chip and PIN protection, your information stays secure.
* Loyalty cards and offers are also stored, all in one place. Already in use at over 200,000 merchants, including restaurants, gas stations, retail stores and more.
* To celebrate the launch of the Isis Mobile Wallet app, Verizon is treating its customers to a $10 credit provided they’ve downloaded the app and activated a new American Express Serve Account. An additional $10 is available after your first contactless transaction at a Verizon location.

* AT&T customers can buy the case from the AT&T web store here and download their carrier’s version of the Isis Mobile Wallet app from the App Store.
* Introduced last July as an interesting joint venture between rival carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, the Isis service competes with Google Wallet in the mobile payment space.
* It picked up support from major credit card companies, includes loyalty reward programs and is available at more than 200,000 payment locations in the United States.
