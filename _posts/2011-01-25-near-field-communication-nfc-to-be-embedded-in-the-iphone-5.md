* By now you’ve likely heard lots of chatter about Near Field Communication, as it’s being touted as the next big breakthrough in mobile payment methods.
* Basically NFC allows mobile device owners to use their phones to make purchases, eliminating the need for credit cards.
* Google is already highly interested in the technology as evident by its inclusion in the Nexus S by Samsung. Now reports are surfacing that NFC will be included in the iPhone 5 as well…
* Just what are the benefits to Apple, and more importantly, what will the benefits be to end users?
* Well, for Apple, the plus sides are obvious; the main point being that it won’t have to eat as many credit card fees associated with transactions occurring on iTunes, the Apple Store, etc.
* Pushing these cheaper methods of payments benefits most retailers, not just Apple. A second, even more lucrative possibility for Apple is strategically placed iAds at higher premium rates.
* NFC is a technology that can beam and receive information within 4 inches of its destination, so strategically placed ads could come into play depending on where a customer is shopping, or what they decide to purchase.
* Apple could understandably ask for a higher fee for such ads since the possibility of a quick turnaround is higher than if the customer was sitting at home mulling over a purchase.
* For the end users, the benefits are there too; quicker, more diverse payment options and less stuff to carry around.
* Proponents of NFC face an uphill battle as they try to get retailers and hardware manufacturers to adopt the technology. With Apple behind it, the adoption rate could increase dramatically.
* Stay tuned for more information concerning the iPhone 5 and NFC.
* What do you think about the possibility of a virtual wallet?
