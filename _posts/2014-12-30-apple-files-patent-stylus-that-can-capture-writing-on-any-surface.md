* Apple has been granted a patent by the USPTO on Tuesday that describes a stylus that will allow a user to write on any surface, and translate it onto their iPhone or iPad. The feature set is similar to the Livescribe 3 Smartpen, that works on Livescribe Dot Paper by using an onboard camera.
* However, the technology Apple has applied for sounds more advanced and more seamless. Instead of using a camera and specialized paper, Apple’s stylus uses accelerometers and motion-sensing to activate only when picked up, its nib is pressed to paper, withdrawn from a dock or manually turned on by the user. 
* Of course, just because Apple files for a patent, doesn’t mean we will actually see the feature be released. It would be rather interesting, as Apple has never chosen to release a stylus with its iPad product – leaving the stylus market to third-party players. Users enjoy the benefits of styluses for drawing and writing on their iPad screens.
* In Apple’s patent, it describes being able to change out the pen head to write on different surfaces. The imaginative product could write on notebooks, tables, walls, or even in the air.
* Apple filed its first patent for a stylus in 2010, so it’s not exactly a new concept for the engineers in Cupertino. However with rumors Apple could launch a 12-inch “Pro” version of its iPad, an official Apple stylus could make sense.
