* Snapchat on Friday launched a trio of iPhone X-exclusive lenses it promised months ago.
* They include a Mardi Gras-esque mask, a Day of the Dead skull and a gold-plated eye cover, The Verge said. Taking advantage of TrueDepth camera hardware and Apple’s APIs, the app tracks 50+ facial muscles in real time, including movements in the eyelids and mouth.
* Head and face tracking data, coupled with depth information, is then used to mold and superimpose augmented reality masks onto the user’s face with uncanny precision.
* iPhone X lenses stick more tightly to your face

* Depth data lets the app render a blurred background akin to Portrait shooting mode. If you take a closer look at some of the details, you’ll notice that objets like diamonds that are part of the new augmented reality masks interact appropriately with the user’s ambient lighting.
* This is a backend refresh that doesn’t require an update to Snapchat’s mobile app. Launch Snapchat right now on your iPhone X and you should be able to access the three new lenses from within the app. If you don’t own an iPhone X, you won’t see the new filters.
* While app makers have access to the user’s facial topography, the mathematical representation of your face that the Face ID feature uses to let you unlock the phone with a glance is securely stored encrypted within the Secure Enclave. That crucial data never leaves your device: it is not shared with apps, it is not available to developers or stored in iCloud.
* Apple also strictly bars developers from using facial captures to profile users, deliver targeted advertising or sell that data to analytics companies and data brokers.
* Grab Snapchat for free from App Store.
