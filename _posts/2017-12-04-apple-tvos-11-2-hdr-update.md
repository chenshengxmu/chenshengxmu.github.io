* Apple has released tvOS 11.2 to the public today, after several weeks of beta testing. The update will be installed automatically, or you can push it manually by navigating to System > Software Update on your Apple TV.
* The update is fairly insignificant, save for new options in the Audio and Video section that allow Apple TV 4K owners to set matching frame rate and dynamic range behavior independently. This should provide a boost in performance during GPU-enhanced experiences like gaming.
* tvOS 11.2 also brings about access to live sports via the ESPN app. The Sports app can be accessed via the new Sports section located at the bottom of the TV app, and content is customized based on the userâ€™s team preferences.
* Over the weekend, Apple released iOS 11.2 for iPhones and iPads, with support for Apple Pay Cash and more.
