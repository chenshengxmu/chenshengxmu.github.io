* Famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is saying that Apple is abandoning Touch ID, which he thinks will be superseded by Face ID on all iPhone models coming next year.
* Just a few days ago, the analyst said that iPhone X’s TrueDepth camera and 3D facial recognition have convinced Android makers that depth sensing is the way to go. That’s where the industry is headed as fingerprint scanning is becoming increasingly boring.
* He wrote in yesterday’s note to clients, obtained by MacRumors:
* We predict all new 2H18F iPhone models will likely abandon fingerprint recognition. We believe this change will allow all new models to realize a competitive advantage via differentiation, on the back of an integrated user experience of full-screen design and TrueDepth Camera, facial recognition, Face ID and augmented reality applications.
* 3D sensing, he said, will be a “key selling point” of 2018 iPhones as the TrueDepth camera and Face ID will help Apple “capitalize on its clear lead in 3D sensing design and production for smartphones.” He does not see Apple exploring under-display fingerprint technology.
* Kuo also expects 2018 iPad Pro models to transition to Face ID.
* If he’s right, then all iPhone models introduced next year should have a fullscreen design similar to iPhone X even if some of the upcoming models will retain LCD panels, as The Wall Street Journal suggested in January.
* Smartphone fingerprint scanners won’t be going away overnight—you’ll be seeing them on budget and mid-tier Android devices for years to come—but they are going to be supplanted by more secure 3D facial recognition systems on premium smartphones like iPhone.
* Here’s what Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi told Daring Fireball’s John Gruber on an episode of The Talk Show regarding Face ID vs Touch ID:
* Honestly, we’re just all counting the days that customers can finally get their hands on these. Because I think just like with Touch ID, initially people thought oh, ‘Apple’s done something that’s totally not going to work and I’m not a believer and I’m not gonna use this feature.’
* Now everyone’s worried because they can’t imagine life without Touch ID. We’re going to see exactly the same thing with Face ID.
* Once people start using Face ID, any concerns customers may have will “melt away” because Face ID is “that much better,” Federighi added.
* Look no further than the numbers: one in 50,000 for Touch ID versus one in a million for Face ID. No matter how you look at it, Face ID is far more secure than Touch ID and that’s enough of a motivation for Apple to roll out Face ID to future iPhone models as soon as possible.
* Still, perhaps Apple should think about creating a new budget iPhone with Touch ID?
* Such a device would be perfect for those who don’t necessarily want to be forced into using Touch ID or don’t need the latest tech at premium price points.
* What do you think?
