* Apple’s newly-unveiled iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are truly stunning in visual appeal and new features, and many of you are undoubtedly going to be either pre-ordering this Friday or lining up at your local stores to try and get one when they’re available.
* Because I love what the iPhone 7 is all about, you can bet I’ll be ordering one. I’m personally a huge fan of the new glossy Jet Black finish, and because I’m upgrading from an iPhone 6 Plus, I expect the battery life improvements and speedier hardware thanks to the new A10 Fusion SoC will be a significant bump for me, especially in multitasking and gaming.
* Of course, I’m also excited for the new camera features that come on the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus, so that’s likely the model I’ll be going for. I often use my iPhone for photos and videos, and this will be the first time I get into the 4k video shooting scene.
* Unfortunately, one thing that doesn’t really work in my favor is I would really like to get a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, but I really only need 32GB of storage. Of course, Apple starts the bid at 128GB for that particular color, which means I have to shell out an extra $100 for essentially no good reason.
* My opinion aside, how do you feel about the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? Let us know in the poll below whether or not you’re going to be upgrading to the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus this year.
