* I don’t know about you, but I rarely use the timer found in the stock Clock app. I know Sebastien has mentioned that he uses the timer from time to time while cooking, but he’s one of the few I know who do.
* The Control Center panel in iOS 7 features a shortcut to the timer section of the stock Clock app. Personally, I think it would have been more beneficial to link that shortcut to the alarm clock section of the Clock app. If there’s one area of the stock Clock app that I frequent on a daily basis, it’s the alarm clock section.
* Jailbroken iOS 7 users can now reassign the timer shortcut to the alarm clock. Take a look inside at our video walkthrough to see how…
* CCClockOpenToAlarm is the name of the tweak, and despite its horrendous name, it works exactly as advertised. Upon installing, there are no settings or options to configure, just install and it starts working. Now, whenever you tap on the clock shortcut in Control Center, the stock Clock app will open up to the alarm clock section instead of the timer section.
* CCClockOpenToAlarm is available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for free. Let me know what you think about it in the comments section.
