* Folks who keep their music, photos, documents and other stuff stored in the Amazon cloud are aware of the online retailer’s dedicated iOS software aptly named Cloud Player which can stream songs from your cloud locker to your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices.
* Although Amazon has yet to release the official Cloud Drive app for Apple’s mobile platform (it’s available on OS X), today it inched toward that goal by releasing a brand new photo management application for iOS.
* As the name suggests, the Amazon Cloud Drive Photos application lets you browse image files stored in your Amazon cloud storage, download individual images to your iPhone or iPad, upload on-device images to keep them securely backed up in the cloud and more…
* Amazon’s blurb:
* Protect and store all of your photos in one place with Amazon Cloud Drive Photos. Access your photos from your iPhone or iPod touch, your computer, or any web browser.
* Take a picture on your iPhone and save it to the Amazon Cloud to enjoy on your computer. Upload photos from your computer and enjoy them on your iPhone or iPod touch.
* It includes standard sharing features (Facebook, Twitter, Email) and has an automatic uploading option akin to Dropbox and Facebook iOS apps. What it does is basically upload all photos from the iOS Camera roll to your Cloud Drive.
* Due to iOS limitations, automatic uploading only works when the app is running. In case you’re wondering, each Cloud Drive account gets fife gigabytes of storage right out of the box, with paid upgrades available.

* Apple has a similar built-in iOS feature called Photo Stream, though Amazon’s Cloud Photos software has a clear advantage of uploaded snaps being easily browsable online through a browser.
* While that’s not possible with iOS Photo Stream, another iOS feature called Shared Photo Streams does allow you to create online albums that can be shared directly with other iOS users, or on the web at large (here’s how to make Shared Photo Streams public).
* Go ahead and download Amazon Cloud Drive Photos free from the App Store. Android users can go to Google’s Play store, where the app’s been available since November.
