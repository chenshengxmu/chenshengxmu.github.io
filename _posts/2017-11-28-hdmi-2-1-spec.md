* HDMI Forum today released the final version of the HDMI 2.1 specification following a preview earlier this year. It includes support for 10K displays, dynamic HDR content, high frame rate 4K video at 120 frames per second and 8K video at 60 frames per second, plus much more.
* HDMI 2.1 has many new features that we will undoubtedly see in products in the next couple years, like 10K monitors. Additionally, it introduces a new ultra speed HDMI cable that boosts bandwidth to 48Gbps, enough to handle uncompressed 8K video with dynamic HDR.
* Among other new features, HDMI 2.1 supports new refresh rates, including 8K at 60 frames per second and 4K at 120 frames per second. 4K at 120 frames per second will be especially great for playing immersive games and enjoying those slo-mo video clips shot on your iPhone.
* Luckily, HDMI 2.1 will be backwards-compatible with previous versions.
* The HDMI 2.1 Compliance Test Specification (CTS) should be out early to mid-2018. First products supporting the updated HDMI specification should start rolling out shortly after.
