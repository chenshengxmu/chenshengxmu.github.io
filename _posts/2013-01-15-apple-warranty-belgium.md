* Apple’s warranty adventure in the European Union is far from being over. After the company failed to properly communicate to its Italian consumers that they were entitled to a EU-wide two-year warranty (first warranty year provided by the manufacturer and the second by the seller), for which it was fined $264,000 last month and $1.2 million in March, now Apple has gotten itself into trouble with a Belgian consumer watchdog, Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats…
* According to a compliant the agency filed against Apple (via TechCrunch) because “Apple remained deaf to the demands” the iPhone maker continues to advertise its AppleCare warranty plan “in a manner which doesn’t properly explain consumer rights to Belgian gadget shoppers”.
* The decision to pursue legal action comes only after Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats decided to join up with 10 other Europe-based entities to make complaints about how Apple operates its warranties, but now the group feels it is time to escalate to a court case after efforts to petition the Mac maker have gone unheard.
* Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats is also citing the Italian case as a precedent, noting that Apple modified its practices there following a $1.2 million penalty in that case. Apple sells the AppleCare warranty plan as an add-on to the existing one-year warranty. The problem is, inside the EU market a two-year warranty is mandatory.
* Help me out here as I have a hard time understanding Apple’s motives.
* The company should know better. And if Italy was anything to go by, other EU markets will also force legal actions in order to push Apple into changing its stance.
* After all, the fine Italian regulators slapped Apple with did force positive changes in Apple’s policy and the company even removed the AppleCare products from its Italy online store.
* Why should other EU markets be any different?
