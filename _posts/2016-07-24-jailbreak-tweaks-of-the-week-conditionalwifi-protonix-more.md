* The jailbreak community has been very quiet for several months but this is about to change with today’s release of a jailbreak for iOS 9.2 – 9.3.3. Despite what has been another slow week, there are still some developers rocking jailbroken devices, and as a result, tweak development continues.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you the jailbreak tweaks that were released this week, starting with our favorites and then moving on to the rest.

* Protonix is an awesome new jailbreak tweak release that lets you set up dynamic keywords on your jailbroken device.
* Dynamic keywords can be used to replace your keyword with real-time information about your device, special information not related to your device, or to activate Activator actions of your choosing. You can even nest your keywords inside of one another to create more complete string of text.
* All you need to do is configure your keywords the way you want them to be configured, and then interesting things will happen when you type them from any app.
* You can read our full review of Protonix to learn more about how the tweak works.

* ConditionalWiFi is a tweak that lets you limit app access to Wi-Fi networks.
* iOS comes with a stock feature that lets you limit application connections to the internet when you’re connected to a cellular network, so this tweak just takes that and flips it around. There are some real-life scenarios where you might actually want to do this.
* The tweak adds its options right to iOS’ default Wi-Fi preferences pane, making things super easy to configure and use.
* To learn more about those, you can read our full review.
* TIFF Disabler: Disables TIFF image rendering on your device to protect you from CVE-2016-4631 (free – review)
* TwitterUICustomizer: Lets you colorize the Twitter app to your liking (free – review)
* Despite the fact that there’s no jailbreak for current iOS versions, Pangu re-ignited hope not too long ago that we’d see another jailbreak some time after the public iOS 10 release. Until then, however, we will have to make do with what we have. Those that are jailbroken on iOS 9.1 or earlier have to continue to stay there.
* If you are jailbroken, and have been in search of more cool jailbreak tweaks to install, you can check out last week’s roundup, and continue to stay tuned to iDB for future releases.
