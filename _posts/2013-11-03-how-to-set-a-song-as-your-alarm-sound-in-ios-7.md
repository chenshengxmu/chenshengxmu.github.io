* There may be a number of great alarm clock apps in the App Store that offer various features, but for most of us, the stock Clock app on iPhone is just what we need: it looks good and works great. If you want to give the native alarm option a try, you may find that it is the only app you need to wake you up in the morning.
* Not only that, but Apple also added a plethora of chimes and tones to keep your ears interested, or at least to get your brain to wake up in the morning. But if you are tired of being waken up to the sound of “Night Owl” and “By the Seaside” you will be happy to know that you can add your own music as the alarm sound.
* Using your own music as an alarm sound is a lot easier than you might think. Apple makes it fairly easy to find, if you know where to look for it.
* Step 1: Open the Clock app.
* Step 2: Select the “Alarm” tab from the icons at the bottom.
* Step 3: Tap the “Edit” button in the top left corner of the screen.
* Step 4: Select the alarm you wish to use a song for.
* Step 5: Tap “Sound.”

* Step 1: Open the Clock app.
* Step 2: Select “Alarm” from the icons at the bottom.
* Step 3: Tap the plus + button in the top right corner of the screen.
* Step 4: Set the time, recurrence, and label if you want to.
* Step 5: Tap “Sound.”
* Step 6: Under “Songs” tap, “Pick a Song.”
* Step 7: Select a song from your device’s music library.
* Now you will be able to set a different song for every day of the week if you want to have a little variety in your life.
* Do you use the native Clock app for your alarm? If you use a third-party alarm clock app, which is your favorite?
