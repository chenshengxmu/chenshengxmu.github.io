* A new report published this morning claims that Apple will seed developers with a brand new Apple TV software development kit (SDK) as early as its annual developers conference which kicks off with a San Francisco keynote next Monday.
* Conceivably, the goal of the SDK would be to foster growth of the third-party app ecosystem around the Apple TV, the $99 set-top box which remains closed to app developers (unless you jailbreak, that is)…
* “A trusted source” told Boy Genius Report editor Jonathan Geller that the SDK will let devs write apps that will run on television by way of the Apple TV puck.
* We have heard from a source that Apple will be introducing a TV SDK at WWDC next week. This would enable third-party developers to create software for Apple’s TV products.
* I’ve always insisted that Apple will want to unleash its iOS ecosystem in the living room, for which I’d often been ridiculed by my former boss.
* It’s a no-brainer, really.
* For example, esteemed pundit John Gruber recently speculated over at his Daring Fireball blog that a bunch of “To Be Announced” sessions on the WWDC agenda indicate that apps are coming to the Apple TV.
* It’s one of the few things I can imagine would that would be big, new, and different enough to warrant that much attention at WWDC.
* With the iOS SDK now supporting four different screen resolutions going all the way up to the iPad 3’s 2,048-by-1,536 pixel Retina display, why just not add a full HD 1,920-by-1,080 preset and let people create programs for the big screen?
* Everyone is figuring out how to crack this space and Apple would be really foolish to ignore it, lest it risks getting left behind.

* This new reports jives nicely with a recent write-up, also by Boy Genius Report, claiming that a near feature-complete version of the re-worked Apple TV operating system will launch at WWDC.
* The story specifically mentioned that this new software will power a standalone television set. A new “control out” API is also being mulled, reportedly letting third-parties engineer accessories compatible with the iTV.
* One would also be able to control any connected components, all from the Apple remote. As the current Apple Remote has very limited functionality, a redesign would be needed, quite possibly akin to the concept outlined in this patent.
* So, third-party apps on your television screen.
* Yes or no?
