* We have some pretty diehard fans. Quite a few of our readers boast about not being able to go to work until reading our news and jailbreak articles. Some have even mentioned adding our RSS feed to their SMS notification through IFTTT.
* For those that don’t already know how to use the trigger-and-action service, we have a quick tutorial for creating an IFTTT recipe from both the website and the iOS app. This will allow you to receive SMS notifications every time an article is published on iDB…
* As a friendly reminder, we know that a lot of our readers already know how to create recipes using IFTTT. This tutorial is for our new readers who may not already have experience with the trigger-and-action community. If you know how to create a recipe, feel free to skip our tutorial. Maybe we will have something new for you next time.
* If you haven’t already, go to IFTTT.com and sign up. All you need is an email account and password. You can also do this on your iPhone from the IFTTT app.
