* A new report Monday from the fairly reliable Japanese outlet Mac Otakara claims that Apple’s rumored 10.9-inch iPad Pro model (10.1/10.5-inch, depending on a source) will have the same footprint as the current 9.7-inch models thanks to a lot skinnier bezel on the left and right side.
* Citing unnamed Taiwanese sources, the publication reports that the device will also be a tad thicker than the existing 9.7-inch iPads at 7.5 mm, making it thicker than the iPad Air 2 (6.1 mm) and the same thickness as the original iPad Air.
* “Informed” sources told Mac Otakara that the device will retain the top bezel where the front-facing FaceTime camera is found. The iconic Home button should be removed though the report stops short of specifying how Apple plans to replicate its functionality.
* Apple could replace the physical Home button with either on-screen controls or an in-screen Home button that it’s expected to implement on an ‘iPhone 8’ next year.
* As for the increased thickness, the extra space could be used to accommodate a bigger battery, an additional display layer containing an array of 3D Touch sensors, a higher-resolution screen or other yet unknown hardware additions.
* Interestingly enough, Mac Otakara mentions that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also see its thickness increase by 0.3 mm to 7.2 mm versus the current iPad Pro thickness of 6.9 mm (the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is 6.1 mm deep).
* Last but not least, the report states that an upcoming 9.7-inch iPad Pro model will be replacing the existing 7.9-inch iPad mini 4. That rumored device is expected to have the same size and thickness as Apple’s diminutive tablet, sources told Mac Otakara.
