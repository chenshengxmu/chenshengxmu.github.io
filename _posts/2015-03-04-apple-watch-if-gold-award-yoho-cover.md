* Apple’s Watch has just won an aptly named iF Gold Award from the International Forum in its annual industrial design competition, and it’s not started shipping yet!
* According to the award organizers, the meticulously designed wrist-worn gizmo is “already an icon” even though it’s slated to ship in April.
* Also, the device’s tour of the world’s fashion and lifestyle magazines continues with another Watch appearance, this one on the cover of the Chinese magazine Yoho.
* “The idea of combining classic materials such as leather and metal with state-of-the-art technology to create a very individual fashion accessory has resulted in a delightful product offering a holistic user experience,” reads the iF Gold Award website.
* “The Apple Watch scores highly for each design detail and is an altogether extraordinary piece of design. For us, it is already an icon.”

* Washington D.C. born actor has appeared in notable television shows like Chicago P.D., Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
* Apple’s been pitching the Watch to rich fashionistas and those who aspire to be in that camp for months now.
* Following the November 2014 issue of Vogue China which featured an 18-karat yellow gold Apple Watch Edition on its cover, other lifestyle and fashion magazines have put the device on their respective covers, including US’s Vogue and Self, UK’s Style and Hong Kong’s East Touch to name but a few.
