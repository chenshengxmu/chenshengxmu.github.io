title: Major Real Racing 3 update is out- cloud saves, new Chevy cars, 100+ events
---
* As promised, super publisher Electronic Arts and developer Firemonkeys just rolled out a major update to the awesome free-to-play Real Racing 3, bringing out over a hundred new events and two Chevy vehicles. The one feature I’ve been waiting for is an improved game saving capability: in Real Racing 3 version 1.1, your progress is now saved and synced across all your devices via the cloud.
* This finally lets me to kill a few minutes on my iPhone while standing in the line at a bank and then continue playing right where I left off on my iPad. More tidbits and some nice screenies right below the fold…
* The aptly named Chevrolet update features the Chevrolet Cobalt SS and the Camaro ZL1. Also cool, now there’s an all-new Hunter mode and you can compare and compete with friends using the new statistics leaderboard.
* Here are the Camaro ZL1 and Cobalt SS, looking like a million dollars.
