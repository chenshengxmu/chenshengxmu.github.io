* iOS 12 is designed to make your iPhone and iPad experience even faster, more responsive and more delightful. Most of the work is focused on reliability and stability, but that doesn’t mean that iOS 12 has nothing interesting to offer in terms of new features and improvements.
* We asked our resident video guy Harris Haycraft to put together a quick and dirty hands-on video walkthrough of the more than 50 new features, important changes and enhancements for your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch in iOS 12.
* Without further ado, here’s what Harris came up with.

* For the full picture of everything iOS 12 brings to the table, be sure to watch Harris’s initial hands-on videos from yesterday highlighting the key iPhone and iPad-specific features.
* The official iOS 12 Preview features webpage along with the iOS 12 press release, the iOS 12 Screen Time press release and the WWDC 2018 Highlights webpage all provide very nice and up-to-the-point overview sof the biggest new features coming with iOS 12.
