* Now that we’re fairly confident that we’re just a few weeks away from hearing an iPhone announcement, expect the rumors and blurry spy shots to kick into overdrive.
* The closer we get, the more likely it is that a factory worker or carrier executive has seen the device. Keeping that in mind, there’s another iPhone 5 spy shot floating around the web…
* The image above appears to be the inside of a manufacturing plant, and a lot of folks believe that the batches of smartphone screens you see belong to Apple.
* While it’s hard to tell if the display has gotten any larger, the device seems to have the elongated home button we’ve been hearing so much about. The bigger button has been rumored to double as an area for swipes and gestures.

* The photo originally surfaced on Weibo, a Chinese equivalent to Twitter. It has since been reposted by sites like 9to5Mac, and MICgadget, who believe the photo could be legit.
* My first thought was that there’s no way anyone could get a camera into a place like this, but MICGadget has an interesting theory on how it came about:
* “Previously we reported that workers of Wintek were getting poisoned during the production of Apple touchscreens by the N-Hexane cleaners, and there’s a rumor saying that Wintek is using video cameras to monitor their poisoned workers.”
* With the hundreds of counterfeit Apple products bouncing around China, there’s a good chance that this isn’t the real deal. But if it was, and that’s a big if, it would seem like the purported  “gesture area/home button” is materializing.
* What’s your take on the above photo?
