* Yesterday, I found this thread on Reddit and was reminded of how many great jailbreak tweaks exist outside of Cydia’s default repos. Of course, developers like Ryan Petrich are well-known for their beta repos, but there are some other lesser-known repos that you should be aware of as well. Here’s a list of ten jailbreak tweaks that are available outside of the popular BigBoss and ModMyi repos.
* Displays the most recent upcoming alarm on the Lock screen.

* Repo: http://repo.fortysixandtwo.com/
* Change the colors of the Messages app bubbles.

* So that’s 10 excellent tweaks (or apps in the case of Kodi) that you won’t find on the default Cydia repos. To download these tweaks, you’ll need to add their corresponding repos to your list of Cydia sources. Remember, you can do that from the Sources tab → Edit → Add, then type in the repo address.
