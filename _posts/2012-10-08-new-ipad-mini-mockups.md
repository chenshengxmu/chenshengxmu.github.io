* In between writing today’s report of a “slicker-than-the-iPad-3” iPad mini and conceiving a poll about the perceived value of a non-Retina iPad mini, I’ve stumbled upon a new set of high-quality photographs showing a familiar looking iPad mini mockup next to the regular 9.7-inch iPad. Presumably, the snaps represent one of the iPad mini dummies floating around in Asia rather than the real deal, but nonetheless they offer a good comparison between the smaller iPad and its bigger sibling, in detail not seen before. Jump past the break for the full gallery…
* 9to5Mac points us to a piece by Chinese blog Wretch.cc which published nice photographs featuring one of the iPad mini dummies folks painstakingly create based on intel leaking out of the rumor-mill.

* Notice the skinnier side bezels we keep hearing about.
* Here’s another one.

* Doesn’t look much thinner than the current iPad. It also appears to contrasts somewhat an alleged schematic calling for an ultra-thin body akin to the iPod touch’s slim 7.2mm profile.
* Could be just me…
* Here’s the full gallery.

* Before you jump straight to the comments: again, these images depict iPad mini mockups (or dummies, as they’re called) created by someone in China with too much time on their hands.
* It’s mockups like these that help us better imagine a possible (but certainly not definite) design.
* So, comments?
