* Well that didn’t take long. Apple has now sold out of all new iPad models (here in the US at least) that were allotted for pre-order sales.
* Yesterday, we pointed out that shipping times were slipping to March 19th on some models of Apple’s latest tablet. But now it appears that all versions are seeing the delay…
* As noted by Cult of Mac, if you go to pre-order a new iPad from Apple’s online store right now, the earliest you can have the device shipped is March 19th — regardless of color or model.
* So if you’re wanting to get your hands on the new slate by launch day (March 16th), it looks like you’ll have to go hop in line at your local retail store.
* Even if you don’t mind receiving your new iPad a few days late, you still may not want to hold out on ordering. Last year, it took Apple several months to catch up with consumer demand for the iPad 2 after its initial stock was depleted.
