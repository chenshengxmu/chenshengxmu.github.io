* Sprint is the most recent carrier to have gained Apple’s iPhone on its network, after paying big bucks. According to its 10-K filing with the SEC released this morning, Sprint has committed to buying almost $15.5B worth of iPhones from Apple, The Next Web points out.
* Asymco figured that each iPhone is sold for roughly $630 ARPU from Apple to Sprint. This means, Sprint has committed to buying almost 24 million iPhones…
* Sprint has made note that it expects revenue to be down in 2012, as the carrier works to turn a profit for the big iPhone buyout. Sprint expects to sell the 24 million units sometime in the next 4 years.
* Carrying the iPhone for Sprint is actually a pretty big deal to the company. On the Sprint iPhone’s opening day, it set the record for highest sales day for Sprint. The carrier also sold a total of 1.8 million iPhones last quarter.
* Are you one of the Sprint iPhone owners?
