* Google’s Calendar app on the web just got its first major redesign since 2011.
* According to the search giant, the new-look Calendar is prettier and aligned with its Material Design scheme with responsive layout and other new features.
* The new look for Calendar is gradually being rolled out to Google Apps users first, but you can enable it now on your personal Google Account by following the instructions provided below.
* 1) On your computer, visit calendar.google.com and sign in with your account.
* 2) Click the button Use New Calendar in the top-right corner.

* For company accounts, you’ll need to ask your administrator to enable it.
* According to Google, your administrator can navigate to Apps → G Suite → Calendar → New Calendar to set when they’d like users to access the new version of Google Calendar.
* To switch back to the old design for Google Calendar on the web, do the following:
* 1) On your computer, visit calendar.google.com and sign in with your account.
* 2) Click the Settings cog.
* 3) Choose the option labeled Back to classic Calendar from the menu.
