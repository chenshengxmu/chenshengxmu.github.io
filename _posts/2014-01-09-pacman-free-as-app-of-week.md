* Apple has named Namco Bandai’s classic PAC-MAN game its App of the Week for this week. This means that through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the application for both your iPhone and iPad, for free—a sizable savings of $7.
* For those unfamiliar with the game, it’s essentially an iOS port of the popular arcade game that first debuted in 1980. In it, you navigate a tiny character around various mazes while trying to eat pellets and fruit and avoid deadly ghosts…
* From the App Store description:
* “In addition to the Classic maze, there are eight new mazes to explore, each featuring ghost-free Bonus rounds. Try them out for free and purchase them to play forever! Guide PAC-MAN with two different control modes. Chomp on pellets with the swipe of a finger in Swipe Mode, or navigate through the mazes by touching the onscreen Joystick in Joystick Mode.
* Munch fruits and other items for big points! Gobble flashing Power Pellets to weaken ghosts temporarily and eat them up before they change back. Avoid Blinky, the leader of the ghosts, and his fellow ghosts Pinky, Inky and Clyde, or you will lose a life. Get an extra life when you reach 10,000 points.”
* And here are some of the top features:
* – Arcade perfect classic PAC-MAN – 8 new mazes for all new challenges – Two different control modes – Three game difficulties – Retina display support

* You shouldn’t just get PAC-MAN because it’s a classic game, it’s also a lot of fun to play. It’s quick to load and fast-paced, making it perfect for keeping you entertained while in line, or on an airplane. And it has a 4-star rating in the App Store.
