* LockAlert is a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to easily close a push notification preview straight on your iPhone’s lockscreen. Instead of having to slide to unlock your iPhone, the notification can be dismissed by tapping an “X” that LockAlert adds to the top corner of the preview dialog.
* If you aren’t using a replacement system of notifications, like MobileNotifier, on your jailbroken iPhone, LockAlert could be the perfect addition to the iOS method of push notifications.
* When you download LockAlert from Cydia, no extra icon is added to your homescreen. In Settings, you will have the option to disable or enable the tweak.
* If you feel like you may accidentally tap the Close “X” in the top left corner of the notification preview, then LockAlert may not be for you. But, in a pinch, LockAlert could help you quickly clear that embarrassing text notification from your Mom.
* Here’s a short video demo of LockAlert:
* LockAlert is available for free in Cydia under the ModMyi repo. Be sure to download this tweak and give it a try!
* Do you find LockAlert useful?
