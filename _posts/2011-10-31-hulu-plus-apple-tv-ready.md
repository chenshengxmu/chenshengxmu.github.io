* It would seem that there is quite the political battle going on inside Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, and the subject matter may not be what you’d expect.
* According to 9to5Mac, Apple is currently mulling over the decision to allow Hulu Plus onto its Apple TV platform. That’s right, Hulu Plus.
* The story suggests that there is currently a completed build of Hulu Plus running on internal Apple TVs, and that the app is ready for primetime. In fact, it has been ready for a month. Apple hasn’t yet decided whether to allow it onto the Apple TV alongside the existing Netflix app…
* The reason for Apple’s reluctance is quite simple. With Hulu Plus offering more recent content than the already-installed Netflix, Apple is concerned that giving users access to Hulu Plus will see iTunes sales of TV shows and movies cannibalised.
* Hulu’s iPad app is available on the iOS App Store. AirPlay is not enabled in the Hulu Plus iOS app, and using the HDMI cable to connect the app to a television results in an SD image displayed on-screen. Native Hulu Plus offers HD resolutions, and as does iTunes. Has Apple crippled the iOS app in order to save its iTunes sales?
* Talk of Apple allowing apps onto its Apple TV has been rife since the A4-equipped version went on sale, but so far Apple hasn’t opened its little ‘hobby’ up to third parties.
* With Google giving its own Google TV solution a shot in the arm recently, now might be a good time for Apple to follow suit.
