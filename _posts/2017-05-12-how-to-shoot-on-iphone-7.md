* Apple has published a new mini-website with nearly two dozen how-to videos covering iPhone 7 photography. Titled “How to shoot on iPhone 7”, the mini tutorials run about forty seconds each and deal with various topics of interest, including taking depth-of-field images with Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, using tap to focus, adjusting exposure, taking low-light images, capturing selfies with the timer, snapping vertical panoramic photographs, taking stills while filming video and more.
* Here are Apple’s photography how-tos.
* “Use Burst mode to capture that perfect split second”.
* “Make the most of light sources around you to brighten up your photo.”
* “Boldly go from base to summit with a vertical pano.”
* “Life looks different from 10 cm away. See how to capture it beautifully every time.”
* “Use Portrait mode to take an amazing photo of a friend.”
* More photography tips and techniques can be explored via the new mini-site.
