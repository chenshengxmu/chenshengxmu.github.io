* Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, who is currently touring component makers in China, wrote in a note to clients Friday, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, that Apple will unveil a forty percent thinner second-generation Apple Watch at WWDC this summer, its annual pilgrimage for developers.
* “We walked away with the sense that the Apple Watch refresh will not occur in September with the iPhone 7,” reads White’s analysis.
* Instead, it’s “more likely” to occur within the next 2-3 months and “thus we believe an unveiling at WWDC in June makes sense”. Oh, and they also “believe” that the Apple Watch 2 “could be” twenty to as much as forty percent thinner than the current one.
* It certainly doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the next Apple Watch is going to be thinner than the first model.
* In another note, also issued to clients today, White writes about iPhone 7 parts production kicking off in July (no surprises here).
* The handset is expected to help Apple and its suppliers return to smartphone growth in the second half of 2016. We’re posting this for entertainment purposes so take his words with a bunch of slat —White has an awful track record predicting Apple’s moves.

* This is the same guy who said Apple would release a full-on 4K television set along with an ‘iRing’ motion controller that you would wear on your finger. He was adamant that the iPhone 5s would come in three screen sizes, convinced that Apple’s share would zoom past the $1,000 mark and called for a ‘mini iTV’ second-screen experience and a sub-$300 budget iPhone.
