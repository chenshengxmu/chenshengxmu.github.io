* During the company’s quarterly earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company has sold its one billionth iOS device since the original iPhone was released roughly seven years ago – a huge accomplishment.
* Apple reached the feat during November, with a 64GB iPhone 6 Plus that is now kept within Apple’s headquarters to honor the milestone. The one billion iOS devices includes iPhones, iPads, and iPods.
* 1 Billion iOS devices shipped!!

* Cook noted the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus saw the highest demand of any iPhone launch ever. Apple sold on average 34,000 devices per hour over the Christmas quarter.
