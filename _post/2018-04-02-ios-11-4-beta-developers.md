* Apple on Monday seeded the first betas of iOS 11.4, watchOS 4.3.1 and tvOS 11.4 to developers. Registered developers can download the new betas through Apple’s dev center, or they can be installed using each platform’s respective OTA updating mechanism.
* The releases come just days after Apple rolled out iOS 11.3 and other platform updates to the public. We’re currently installing the betas and will be sure to report back with notable changes. See something we’ve missed? Tell us about it down in the comments.
