* Overcast, the popular iOS podcast client by Instapaper creator Marco Arment, has been updated this evening, bringing the app to version 1.1. The update includes a handful of great features such as native iPad and rotation support.
* The app looks just as good on the iPad as it does the iPhone, regardless of whether your device is in portrait or landscape mode. Speaking of, the iPhone version also now supports landscape mode, which looks great on the 6 and 6 Plus.

* Rounding out today’s update is several “small improvements and fixes,” as well as support for Apple’s CarPlay platform. This means that if you have a CarPlay-enabled vehicle or stereo, you can control the app using your car’s head unit.
* I’ve tried a number of great podcast apps over the years, and right now, Overcast is my favorite. It doesn’t have a ton of features, but it does what I need it to, and looks great doing it. Overcast is free in the App Store, with a $4.99 ‘Pro’ IAP.
