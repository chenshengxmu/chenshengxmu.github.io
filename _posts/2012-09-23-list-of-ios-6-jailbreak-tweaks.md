* Though iOS 6 hasn’t been officially jailbroken yet, there is a developer hack available for users on older A4 devices. It’s tethered, and requires you to manually install Cydia, so it’s not something we really recommend. But it exists.
* And because it exists, we decided to try and find out which of our favorite tweaks have been updated to support the new software. Luckily, we came across this list of iOS 6-ready tweaks by theme designer Adam Insull…
*  
* You can find the full list of iOS 6 compatible tweaks on Google Docs. It appears to be locked to prevent user editing, but Insull says that if you discover an error, or have a tweak to add to the list, you can email him.
* And for those of you with older A4 devices running on iOS 6 that are brave enough to try it, we have a tutorial on how to jailbreak using the latest version of RedSn0w. It also shows you how to manually install Cydia via SSH.
