* Apple just issued invites for its long-anticipated media event related to the next iPhone and scheduled to take place on next Wednesday, September 12, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts at 10:00 am.
* As has increasingly been the case, the confirmation comes via The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple whose strong track record of accurate Apple reporting has made him an unofficial mouthpiece for the company…
* John Paczkowski of AllThingsD, a Wall Street Journal-operated blog, has confirmed the information as well.
* Of note, Apple also used San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts to launch all three iPad models.
* The next iPhone arrives at a time when jumbo-sized Android devices continue to gobble up market share everywhere, brutally killing all competition and slowing down Apple’s growth.
* Also important, an analyst estimated today that the iPhone 4S is no longer America’s best-selling handset as the Galaxy S III has beaten Apple’s device in August across three major U.S. carriers (except for AT&T), which is a first for Apple since the original iPhone hit the market five years ago.
* Here’s your invite graphics.

* This has got to be the most minimalistic invite graphics by Apple I have ever seen.
* The “It’s almost here” tagline reminds me of this iPhone 3GS commercial that opens with the “It’s finally here, the first phone to beat the iPhone” line.
* I’m stretching it, yeah – but I needed a good excuse to run that commercial here.
* For what it’s worth, I think it has got to be the best iPhone commercial so far.
* Can you decipher any hint from the above image, apart from the oh-so-obvious shadow cast by the big “12” and looking like a “5”?
* Interestingly, a lot of folks used to point out in comments that Apple will never call this the iPhone 5 because it’s a sixth-generation iPhone.
* It’s also worth stressing that this is looking to be an iPhone-exclusive presser. Of course, we’ve heard before that a rumored smaller and inexpensive iPad will be launched at a separate media event in October.
* As for the shadow of the invite showing a “5”, I’m inclined to believe Apple will call it the iPhone 5 after all, much to the surprise of many.
* According to iDB’s non-scientific poll, nearly four out of each ten respondents voted for the iPhone 5 name and the same percentage of people think Apple will drop the numerical suffix and call the device the new iPhone, akin to the third-generation iPad.
* So, what’s your read of Apple’s invite?
* Meet us in comments.
