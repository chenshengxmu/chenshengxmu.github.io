* If you were sitting on the fence of subscribing to Office 365 just to gain editing functionality in Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps for the iPad, Microsoft has an offer that will knock your socks off.
* All Office 365 subscribers now get unlimited OneDrive storage with their service, the team announced Monday.
* Yup, storage limits just became a thing of the past.
* And with the recently reduced monthly subscriptions now available as In-App Purchases in Office for iPad, you’ll have unlimited OneDrive space for your photos, videos and other documents for as low as seven bucks per month. Again, that’s unlimited OneDrive storage and Office from $7 per month.
* You’ll need an Office 365 Home, Personal or University subscription to take advantage of Microsoft’s offer. If you’re already an Office 365 subscriber, you can be among the first to get unlimited OneDrive storage by getting on the list.
* This is a staggered release so Office 365 subscribers will see unlimited OneDrive applied to their account “in the coming months”. Unlimited storage to OneDrive for Business starts rolling out in 2015.
* How does the competition fare?
* Well, upgrading to 200 gigs of iCloud storage costs $4.99 per month. Google and Dropbox price their respective 1TB tiers at ten bucks per month and Flickr is giving everyone one terabyte of free cloud storage for their photos.
* Microsoft has admittedly upped the ante with today’s offer.
* As a brief recap, a monthly subscription for Office 365 Personal is priced at $6.99 per month. Office 365 Home will run you $9.99 per month. The month-to-month payments compare to the previously available $99.99 annual subscription for Office 365 Home.
* And just to refresh your memory quickly: Office 365 Personal is for people who want to use Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote) on one tablet and a single Mac or Windows PC. Office 365 Home allows individual customers and families to use Office apps on up to five computers and five tablets.
