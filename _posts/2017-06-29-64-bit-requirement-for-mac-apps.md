* We know that iOS 11 marks the end of the road for legacy 32-bit apps and now we’re learning about Apple’s new 64-bit requirement for Mac apps.
* In an advisory on Dev Center yesterday, the Cupertino giant announced that macOS High Sierra will be the last macOS release to support 32-bit apps “without compromise.”
* Apple originally said at the Worldwide Developers Conference that macOS apps submitted to Mac App Store must support 64-bit computing starting January 2018. The new advisory states that Mac app updates and existing apps must support 64-bit starting June 2018.
* “If you distribute your apps outside Mac App Store, we highly recommend distributing 64-bit binaries to make sure your users can continue to run your apps on future versions of macOS,” reads Apple’s note to developers.
* In a separate notice, the company reminded developers to submit updates to their 32-bit apps because iOS 11 is 64-bit only. ”Support for 32-bit apps is not available in iOS 11 and all 32-bit apps previously installed on a user’s device will not launch,” reads the note.
* Two days ago, Apple asked developers to update their product pages for iOS 11’s redesigned App Store.
