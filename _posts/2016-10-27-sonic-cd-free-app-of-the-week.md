* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Sonic CD. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to download the classic Sega hit for both iPhone and iPad for free—a solid savings of $3.
* In this iteration of the popular franchise, Sonic travels to the distant shores of Never Lake and discovers it has been taken over by his arch-nemesis Dr. Eggman. You must help Sonic stop him and restore order to Little Planet.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* We love rediscovering hedge hog history with this enhanced edition of one of Sonic’s greatest adventures. This game sizzles with all the sprawling levels and blazing speed you remember from the ’90s, but this classic platformer is better than ever on the App Store. With crisp widescreen graphics, tight controls, and awesome extra content, it’s just a blast.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Sonic CD is available in the App Store for free.
