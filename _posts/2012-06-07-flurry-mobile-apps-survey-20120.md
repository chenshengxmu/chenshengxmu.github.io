title: Guess what, Eric Schmidt- devs still write for iOS first!

* So mere four days before the WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs’ favorite analytics company posts some peculiar numbers making Google’s former CEO Eric Schmidt look ridiculous.
* Though Android continues to lead the pack in terms of shipments, the iOS train just keeps on chugging along in terms of loyalty and profitability.
* Seven out of ten mobile apps in the first five months of this year were built for Apple’s platform, where developers on average earn four times more revenue…
* Note: don’t interpret this as a hate post. We’ll always be for competition. I’ve been heavily investing into Apple and Google platforms over the years and am loving both my Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4S.
* First on that Schmidt quote from the LeWeb conference last December, via CNET:
* Ultimately, application vendors are driven by volume, and volume is favored by the open approach Google is taking.
* There are so many manufacturers working so hard to distribute Android phones globally that whether you like Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) or not – and again I like it a great deal – you will want to develop for that platform, and perhaps even first.
* Responding to a question from an Android-toting audience member who was frustrated with iPhone exclusives, Schmidt said (and this is gold):
* My prediction is that six months from now you’ll say the opposite.
* Time for a reality check.
* First up, seven months into Ice Cream Sandwich and this latest and greatest Android software is only found on 7.1 percent of Android phones. iOS 5 is reportedly found on up to 80 percent of active iOS devices.
* I’ll get to the ‘why’ of such a disappointing ICS uptake in a second.

* Now, latest survey from advertising and analytics company Flurry – based on data collected from more than 70,000 companies across 185,000+ mobile apps –  proves developers still write apps for iOS first.
* For every 10 apps that developers build, roughly seven are for iOS.
* This is a chart showing developers interest in terms of new project starts.

* The reason for the four percentage points drop in iOS interest since the holiday quarter:
* While Google made some gains in Q1 2012, edging up to over 30 percent for the first time in a year, we believe this is largely due to seasonality, as Apple traditionally experiences a spike in developer support leading up to the holiday season.
* So, why do those right-minded programmers favor Apple’s platform?
* For the same reasons as before: money and fragmentation.
* Developers earn on Apple’s platform four times the Android revenue, per Flurry. Or, for every dollar earned on iOS developers can expect to make 24-cents on Android.
* Flurry sums it up nicely.
* Android delivers less gain and more pain than iOS, which we believe is the key reason 7 out of every 10 apps built in the new economy are for iOS instead of Android.
* I’ve opined before that Android-toting users aren’t accustomed to paying for quality as Google’s ecosystem is largely ad-driven.
* What’s even more telling is that Flurry’s findings are fairly consistent with their research published just a week after Schmidt had made his outrageous claim.
* So here we are six months later and Schmidt’s douchebag critique of iOS has proven terribly off base.
* I wonder how this executive feels about his reputation knowing the overwhelming majority of developers pledge allegiance to Apple’s platform.

* Yes, the iPhone lost a few exclusives as popular apps like Path, Instagram, Instapaper got ported over to Android.
* It’s nothing to write home about: developers are entitled to target whichever platform they choose in order maximize their revenue.
* More $$$ means more quality apps for everyone.
* Smart, no?
* Let’s look at tablets.

* With the tablet market belonging to Apple, no wonder the iPad accounted for a whopping 88 percent of all tablet user sessions. The remaining twelve percent gets distributed between Samsung’s Galaxy Tab (nine percent) and Amazon’s Kindle Fire (three percent).
* Here below we see fragmentation by Android firmware.

* Yes, it’s a huge issue.

* And this is a heatmap representing nearly 4,000 Android devices (via TechCrunch).

* And this is what developing for Android looks like (also via TechCrunch)

* Developers typically have to test their work against at least 400 Android devices before pushing their apps out.
* I think you can imagine the headaches and the sheer time-suck that Android fragmentation imposes on bedroom programmers or even mid-sized studios.
* Contrast this to Apple’s ecosystem divided into two screen sizes (3.5 inch iPhones and iPod touches and 9.7-inch iPads), with two resolution presets each (Retina and non-Retina).
* We’re looking forward to latest platform stats as Google and Apple run their respective developer events, both taking place in San Francisco. Apple’s conference runs June-15 and Google’s is scheduled for June 27-29.
* So we ran an interesting poll asking whether our readers get worked up over iPhone exclusives going Android.
* Turns out the results were pretty evenly spread out between ‘Yes, top apps should be exclusive to iOS’, ‘No, competition is good’ and ‘I don’t care’.
* Of course, we here at iDB are all for competition as each company forces the other to keep innovating or risk being left behind.
* The Android freight train?
* I’ll just leave it at this for now.
