* Apple announced this afternoon that it has increased the size limit of an app package submitted through iTunes Connect to 4GB. That’s double the previous size limit of 2GB, which had been in place since the App Store launched in 2008.
* The move should appease both developers and game-makers, who have been struggling to keep their app sizes under 2GB despite the multiple increases in display resolutions of Apple’s various mobile devices over the past several years.
* The size limit of an app package submitted through iTunes Connect has increased from 2 GB to 4 GB, so you can include more media in your submission and provide a more complete, rich user experience upon installation. Please keep in mind that this change does not affect the cellular network delivery size limit of 100 MB.
* Note that Apple says although it’s increasing the size limit of app bundles, it will still be enforcing the 100MB over-the-air download limit.
