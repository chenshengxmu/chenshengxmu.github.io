* Since last year’s iOS 8.3 software update iOS devices have had the ability to stop asking for a password when downloading free applications from the App Store. Soon after, that feature found its way into iTunes and iBooks for Mac.
* As electronic books are no longer managed through iTunes, disabling password prompts for iBooks Store downloads is now handled in iBooks for Mac. In this post, you will learn how to disable Apple ID password prompts when downloading free electronic books from Apple’s iBooks Store, and we’ll also show you how you can manage password settings for paid items.
* Step 1: Launch iBooks on your Mac.
* Step 2: In the iBooks menu, choose Preferences.

* Step 3: Click the Store tab in the Preferences window.
* Step 4: To disable password prompts for free downloads, select Save Password next to Free Downloads under the Password Settings heading.

* Confirm by entering your Apple ID password, if asked. This will save your Apple ID password for free downloads in the iBooks Store.
* Step 1: Launch iBooks on your Mac.
* Step 2: In the iBooks menu, choose Preferences.
* Step 3: Click the Store tab in the Preferences window.
* Step 4: Now select either Always Require or Require After 15 Minutes in a drop-down menu next to Purchases under the Password Settings heading.

* You might need to enter your Apple ID password to confirm the change.
* Always Require—When you make a purchase, you’ll always be asked to enter your password, even if you’re signed in with your Apple ID.
* Require After 15 Minutes—When you make a purchase, you’ll be asked to enter your password only every fifteen minutes.
* As mentioned, selecting Require After 15 Minutes will tell iBooks not to ask for your password after making a purchase from the iBooks Store after up to fifteen minutes from making a previous purchase.
* Note that the iTunes Store, App Store and iBoos Store don’t provide an option to completely disable password prompts for paid downloads—unlike the Apple TV.

* It’s cool that your password settings are remembered on a per-account basis. In other words, if you set iBooks to never require a password for free downloads with your current Apple ID and then sign in to the iBooks Store with a different Apple ID, your password settings for the previous Apple ID will be remembered and automatically applied when you sign in with it.
