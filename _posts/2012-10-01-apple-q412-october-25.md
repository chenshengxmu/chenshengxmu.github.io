* Club Cupertino is set to release fiscal 2012 fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, October 25, 2012. Data covering the three-month period ending September 30 will also include the first iPhone 5 update since the five million opening weekend sales milestone. Apple’s fourth-quarter guidance calls for revenues of about $34 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $7.65. Also, this…
* We are now pretty sure that invitations for an alleged iPad mini media event are reportedly going out on Wednesday, October 10.
* If true, then the presser will probably take place the following week, with the device hopefully going on sale that Friday or the week after, on October 26.
* In turn, Apple gets to boast blowout (or some such) iPad mini sales in both earnings release and on the conference call.
* From Apple’s Investor page:
* Apple plans to conduct a conference call to discuss financial results of its fourth fiscal quarter on Thursday, October 25, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.
* Apple also said those interested will be able to listen to the call on Thursday, October 25.
* The call will be provided as streaming audio requiring the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 4.2 or above, any Mac running OS X 10.5 or above or any PC running QuickTime 7 or later.
* Helping Apple’s Q4 numbers will also be the new MacBook Pro with Retina display, which was released at WWDC on June 11 alongside refreshed MacBooks and Airs.
* In July, OS X Mountain Lion went on sale and the third-generation iPad finally hit China after Apple paid $60 million to settle the iPad moniker suit with cash-strapped display maker ProView.
* Apple’s shares surged ahead of the September 12 iPhone 5 keynote, passing $700 on strong iPhone 5 pre-orders, an all-time high.
* However, AAPL took some beating lately over the ongoing controversy surrounding iOS 6 Maps, which has resulted in a CEO apology and unusual recommendation of third-party Maps alternatives “while we’re improving Maps”.
* Investors punished the stock which hit $659.39 in after-hours trading.
* At the same time, GOOG is on fire and in early trading this morning passed MSFT, pushing Google ahead as the second most-valuable company, behind Apple.
* Wanna play an analyst?
* Whoever predicts Apple’s Q4 numbers most accurately wins.
