* Frequent users of Apple’s Reminders app know how useful it can be for organizing a busy thought process, but some people don’t like that they can’t customize it.
* Those with jailbroken devices have a little more customization leeway, and new free jailbreak tweak called HideReminderSearchView by iOS developer CydiaGeek lets jailbreakers flex those muscles.
* HideReminderSearchView, as the name implies, lets you hide the Search bar from the Reminders app, simplifying the interface a bit and clearing your screen of a feature that you might never use. You can see what this looks like in the before and after screenshot comparison above.
* The tweak obviously isn’t intended for everyone, but if you keep a bare minimum number of items in your Reminders app at any given time, then you probably can’t justify the need the search function as much as someone who has a plethora items all the time would.
* HideReminderSearchView doesn’t come with any options to configure. Installing the tweak will automatically activate its effects, and you can always disable the tweak by uninstalling it from Cydia.
* If you’re interested in trying HideReminderSearchView, you won’t find it in any of Cydia’s default repositories. To see it, you’ll need to add Cydia Geek’s private repository through Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you should be able to find and install HideReminderSearchView by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.” As it would seem, the tweak works fine on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Do you prefer the way the Reminders app looks sans-search bar? Share your thoughts in the comments below!
