* The always-listening Hey Siri feature lets you wake your HomePod with a simple phrase..
* HomePod, like other Apple devices that support untethered Hey Siri functionality, doesn’t require Internet connectivity for the initial “Hey Siri” hot phrase recognition. Instead, all Hey Siri processing is done locally on the device in offline mode.
* Not unlike Siri on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, nothing you say to Siri on HomePod is sent to Apple’s servers until the speaker recognizes the wake word before a request.

* It’s only after you wake your HomePod with a Hey Siri utterance that it starts recording and uploading your voice to Apple for speech-to-text processing and query analysis. All communication between HomePod and Apple servers is encrypted while anonymous IDs protect your real identity.
* For detailed information about your privacy when using the Siri features, read the detailed iOS Security Guide available as a PDF document from the Apple website.
* Which Siri will respond to Hey Siri?
* An Apple support document states that nearby devices responding to the Hey Siri command quickly communicate to each other locally using Bluetooth in order to determine which one should respond to the request, based on a number of factors.
* HomePod responds to most Siri request, even if there are nearby devices that support Hey Siri. In most cases, the device that heard you best, like your HomePod, or was recently raised, like your iPhone or Apple Watch, should respond to the Hey Siri command. I said “should” because that’s what the support article states, but the system isn’t glitch-free.
* Sometimes, HomePod may be fielding requests meant for your phone or watch.

* If Hey Siri won’t respond on your phone or watch after raising it (Raise to Wake must be turned on), you may want to temporarily disable the Hey Siri function on your speaker.
* Here’s how…
* When there are multiple devices nearby but your HomePod responds to Hey Siri instead of your watch or phone, temporarily disabling the feature might help rectify the situation.
* You can disable Hey Siri via the Home app or by using your voice.
* To turn Hey Siri off in the Home app, do the following:
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or newer.
* 2)  In the Home or Rooms tab, long-tap or press your HomePod with 3D Touch.
* 3) Tap Details in the lower-right corner.
* 4) Set the switch labeled Listen for “Hey Siri” underneath the Siri heading to the OFF position.

* This will temporarily disable the Hey Siri function on this HomePod. Until this feature is re-enabled, you will need to touch and hold the top of your speaker to summon and interact with your assistant manually.
* Just ask your assistant to disable Hey Siri:
* “Hey Siri, turn off Hey Siri.”
* Or…
* “Hey Siri, stop listening.”
* Or some such…
* You’ll be asked to confirm that you’d like to shut down Hey Siri. Respond affirmatively if that’s what you really want. Even when you turn Hey Siri off, you can still activate your personal assistant at any time simply by touching and holding the speaker’s top.
* When using Siri this way, there’s no need to say the magic word—just say your command.

* This must be enabled in order to invoke Siri manually with HomePod touch controls
* Be sure that the option labeled Touch and Hold for Siri has been switched on in your HomePod settings in the Home app or the speaker won’t respond to your touch gestures at all.
* You can turn Hey Siri back on through the Home app or directly on your HomePod:
* To turn Hey Siri back on through the Home app, do the following:
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or newer.
* 2)  In the Home or Rooms tab, long-tap or press your HomePod with 3D Touch.
* 3) Tap Details in the lower-right corner.
* 4) Set the switch labeled Listen for “Hey Siri” underneath the Siri heading to the ON position.

* After a few seconds or so, Hey Siri will get re-enabled on this HomePod.
* When Hey Siri has been temporarily disabled, your HomePod in the Home app displays a red badge with a stylized, crossed out microphone icon to indicate that the speaker is no longer listening.
* To re-enable hands-free Hey Siri functionality, simply touch and hold the top of your Siri speaker and say, “Turn on Hey Siri,” or something along those lines.

* Now you know how to disable and re-enable Hey Siri on your HomePod.
* According to a fascinating article in Apple’s Machine Learning series, the phrase Hey Siri was originally chosen to be as natural as possible, thanks to its brevity and ease of articulation.
* “It was so natural that even before this feature was introduced, users would invoke Siri using the Home button and inadvertently prepend their requests with ‘Hey Siri’,” says Apple.
