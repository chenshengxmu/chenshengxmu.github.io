* The entire jailbreak community has its eyes on pod2g right now. The Chronic Dev Team-affiliated iOS hacker has shown a lot of progress over the last few weeks in his efforts to create an untethered iOS 5 jailbreak.
* Pod2g has demonstrated a working untethered jailbreak on a third-generation iPod touch running the latest iOS software, and recently confirmed it to work on the iPhone 4. Now he’s added several more devices to the list.
* In a string of updates on his blog today, pod2g noted that he has completed the code for his jailbreak for the original iPad, the iPod touch 4G, iPhone 3GS, and Apple TV. He is looking to complete testing on these devices within the next few days.
* “iPad 1 5.0.1 untethered code is done, testing tomorrow with a friend’s device. Just to let you know my progress in real time. iPhone 3GS 5.0.1 untethered code is done. Testing tomorrow also! iPod 4G 5.0.1 untethered too ! :o). Apple TV 2 4.43 untethered done also. Will be able to test in some days.”
* Once he’s done testing his exploit on the above-mentioned products, pod2g’s jailbreak will be nearly complete for all relevant A4 devices. While this is exciting news for some, there still is no word on whether the jailbreak will be compatible with A5 devices, like the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S.
* Stay tuned.
