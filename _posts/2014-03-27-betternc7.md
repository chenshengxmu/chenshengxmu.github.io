* BetterNC7 is a jailbreak tweak geared towards the Notification Center in iOS 7. It’s one of those tweaks that contains a ton of different toggles to disable or enable certain features.
* I’ve never been a huge fan of tweaks like this, just because they seem to add features just for the sake of saying they have a lot of features. That said, there are some nice settings to be found within BetterNC7’s preferences, so it’s worth checking out. Have a look inside to see some of the details on video.
* BetterNC7’s preferences contain about twenty or so different toggles to enable or enable. These toggles pertain to features like the separators within Notification Center, the background, the various tabs at the top of the screen for today, all, and missed, the blur on the background, and various other settings.

* Needless to say, there are tons of toggles available within BetterNC7’s preferences, and not all of them are exactly practical. For instance, the first settings that I showed off on our video walkthrough embedded above, was the transparent background. I don’t know about you, but I find such a setting to be completely worthless in real world day-to-day usage.

* Still, BetterNC7 features quite a few redeeming factors, such as the ability to replace the ‘x’ in Notification Center with a ‘clear’ button to quickly eliminate notifications, and the ability to adjust the preview lines available for notifications. For any changes you make to BetterNC7, you’ll have to perform a respring, which makes using the tweak and configuring its settings a bit on the tedious side.
* Even with its flaws and useful options, BetterNC7 comes recommended. It’s free and it contains enough usefulness to negate its worthless settings and cumbersome implementation. You can find it today on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about BetterNC7 in the comments section below.
