* Apple on Friday added a new ‘Guided Tours’ section to its Apple Watch website, offering an in-depth look at the device’s headlining features ahead of its April 24 launch. The page plays host to walk-through videos, which teach prospective customers how to take advantage of the Watch’s new interactions and technologies.
* As of right now, there are only four videos: Welcome (general overview), Messages, Digital Touch and Faces, but Apple lists several as ‘Coming soon.’ When those have been loaded, users will be able to get guided tours showing them how to use Apple Pay, field phone calls, track their activity and workouts, and much more.
* Announced in September of last year, the Apple Watch is scheduled to launch on April 24, with pre-orders beginning at 12:01 am (PST) next Friday. This will be Apple’s first major product launch since the original iPad, five years ago, and the whole world is watching to see if it can do for wearables, what it did for tablets.
