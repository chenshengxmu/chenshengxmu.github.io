* If you have more than one Apple ID associated with your iPhone for downloading apps from the App Store, then having a way to switch between your accounts more easily might be at the top of your wish list.
* A new jailbreak tweak called StoreSwitcher by iOS developer Ori Kadosh is a new release that was designed with these kinds of people in mind.
* After you install StoreSwitcher, you can go into the App Store and easily switch between your accounts for downloading apps.
* To do it, you simply tap on your account at the bottom of the App Store app, and you’ll see a new button in the Apple ID popup labeled “Switch Account” as shown below:

* When you tap on it, you get a list of all your available App Store accounts. These are the Apple ID accounts you’ve signed into since installing StoreSwitcher.
* With that in mind, if you want to add another account to easily switch to on demand, you’ll need to go to Settings → iTunes & App Store and sign out of your existing account so you can sign into a new one. StoreSwitcher will automatically save your account for future access.
* Having multiple App Store accounts is useful for a number of reasons, including when you want access to apps that are only available in other countries or you have a particular setup with your Apple Music subscription, among other things.
* Fortunately, because Apple doesn’t offer this functionality out of the box, StoreSwitcher has your back and can be had from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $0.99. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices, whether it’s an iPhone or an iPad.
