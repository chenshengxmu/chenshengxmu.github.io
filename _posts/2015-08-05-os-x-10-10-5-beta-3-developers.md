* Apple on Thursday seeded the third beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 to developers. The software, labeled build 14F25a, is available to all registered Mac developers in the Updates section of the Mac App Store, or as a standalone download from Apple’s dev portal.
* Beta 3 of 10.10.5 comes just one week after the second developer beta, suggesting that the software is nearly ready for a public release. The most recent OS X update, 10.10.4, arrived at the end of June with Wi-Fi fixes, and improvements to Mail and Photos apps.
* With that in mind, we don’t expect to see any new features in 10.10.5. Apple essentially confirms as much in the release notes, saying “the OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac.” We’ll let you know if that changes.
* Earlier this week, Apple seeded beta 6 of OS X El Capitan to developers, and a public release is expected within the next few months. That update will include a handful of user-facing features, and will also focus on reliability and other performance-related improvements.
