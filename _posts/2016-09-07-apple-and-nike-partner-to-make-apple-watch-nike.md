* Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand, went on stage at Apple’s event today to announce a collaboration with Apple regarding the Apple Watch. Called Apple Watch Nike+, it’s not just the watch, it’s your “perfect running partner” that delivers an elevated running experience.
* But wait, is it a separate Apple Watch model or an app?
* Well, both.
* The hardware itself is obviously Nike-branded and comes in four specially created colorways. The device itself is, of course, preloaded with Nike’s app.
* You have a shortcut on your watch to take you directly to Nike’s app, or you can use Siri to summon it. The app itself was designed to give you at-a-glance overview of your stats, with an advanced mode available as well.
* The app motivates you with insightful invitations to let you know you’re falling behind your workout regime. You also get reminders every Sunday to join other runners around the world on a run. Lastly, users get automatically enrolled in Nike+ Run Club, giving them access to live runs around the world.
* The Apple Watch Nike+ will be available in late October.
