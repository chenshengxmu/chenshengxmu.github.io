* Great news this afternoon for all of you Chopped and Iron Chef fans, you can now watch your favorite TV shows on your iPhone or iPad. Food Networks released a new iOS app today called Watch Food Network and that allows you to watch some of its top programming on the go.
* The app support the streaming of some of the Food Networks’ most popular shows—including Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and Restaurant Impossible—as well as AirPlay, so you can stream content to your Apple TV, and iCloud sync, so you can always pick up where you left off…
* From the App Store’s description:
* “Watch Food Network wherever and whenever you want with on-the-go access to full episodes and video extras from your favorite shows, like Chopped, Iron Chef America, Restaurant: Impossible, The Pioneer Woman, Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and more. A variety of new clips, full TV episodes and original FoodNetwork.com content is added daily!”
* The app itself is great. The graphics are sharp, the animations are instant, and the menus are easy to navigate. That’s not surprising considering it was developed by Bottle Rocket—the team behind most of the TV apps. And of course we always love iCloud and AirPlay support.
* Unfortunately, there are some restrictions. While anyone can use the app to watch the various short clips and show trailers, you’ll have to sign in with credentials proving you’re a paying cable subscriber to watch full episodes. Obviously that will be a deal-breaker for a lot of folks.
* If you’re a cable subscriber, though, and a fan of any of the aforementioned TV shows, I recommend checking out Watch Food Network. You can find it in the App Store, for both the iPhone and the iPad, for free.
