* Apple has begun to offer free shipping in its online stores for all available products. The holiday offer lasts through December 22nd for US customers, while other countries, like New Zealand, are showing December 25th as the cut-off date.
* Today is Cyber Monday, and many online stores are offering considerable discounts on electronics and other products. Apple, however, is only offering free shipping as a seasonal promotion.
