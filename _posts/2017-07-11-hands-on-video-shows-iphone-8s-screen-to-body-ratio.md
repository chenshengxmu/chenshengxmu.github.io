* YouTuber Unbox Therapy got his hands on the most comprehensive CNC-machined iPhone casing “I’ve ever seen”, offering a look at the handset’s screen to body ratio and other features.
* According to trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, Apple’s flagship 5.8-inch OLED iPhone will have the highest screen-to-body ratio of any smartphone currently available.
* According to the YouTuber:
* iPhone 8 represents a very important device for Apple. In a market where smartphone prices are dropping rapidly companies like Apple and Samsung have to work much harder to convince customers that their products are worth the cost premium.
* Some will say that Apple has copied Samsung in the design of the iPhone but I think the race for maximum screen to body ratio was inevitable for smartphone vendors. Current speculation puts this iPhone 8 design at the top in those terms.
* There’s no other phone currently available that has this much screen in a body this size.
* Prior rumors alleged that iPhone 8 would switch from a 16:9 to an 18:9 display, resulting in a 2:1 aspect ratio that would make the screen appear taller and perhaps slightly narrower than the screens on existing iPhone models.
* The 18:9 aspect ratio has been popularized by the latest phones from Samsung and LG with displays that are taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones.
* And here’s his hands-on video, posted last week.
* Current speculation—supported by the CNC-machined iPhone 8 model in the video and analysts—appears to indicate the lack of a Touch ID fingerprint scanner.
* It’ remains unclear, however, if Apple might decide to opt for an advanced facial recognition unlock system similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 as a Touch ID replacement.
* According to KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves, iPhone 8 could launch without Apple Pay support unless the Touch ID situation is resolved in a timely manner.

* “We do not believe facial recognition would be initially qualified as an acceptable verification method for Apple Pay,” said Hargreaves.
* He explained that the solution wouldn’t work without clear line of sight to your face and, which could pose problems for customers using their iPhone 8 to pay with Apple Pay at stores.
