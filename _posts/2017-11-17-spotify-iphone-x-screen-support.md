* The leading music-streaming service Spotify today refreshed its iPhone and iPad app on App Store with native display support for iPhone X. The Spotify Music app for iOS now takes full advantage of all the pixels available on the 5.8-inch iPhone X display.
* Apps that have not been specifically optimized for the handset’s 2,436-by-1,125-pixel resolution screen run normally, but are letterboxed with black bars at the top and bottom rather than being extended to the very top and bottom of the screen.
* On a related note, Spotify announced today it’s acquired Stockholm-based Soundtrap, which has a web-based collaborative music recording and production studio for artists.
* The Soundtrap service will continue to operate as usual.
* Spotify Music is available at no charge on App Store.
