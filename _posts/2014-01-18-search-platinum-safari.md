* One of the worst things about Safari’s autocomplete for search is that you can’t build on a query like you can do with Google Chrome. Once you select a suggested query in Safari’s omni-box, it auto submits the search.
* While suggested queries are definitely a helpful service, the way that Safari goes about the implementation isn’t very efficient. A recently revamped jailbreak tweak called Platinum seeks to improve Safari’s search capabilities. Have a look at our full video walkthrough inside to see what I mean.
* Once installed, Platinum places a little blue ‘i’ icon to the right of the search suggestions that appear as you type searches in Safari. Tapping the blue icon inserts the suggestion into the search bar without actually submitting the search. By doing it this way, you can actually build on your search using the suggestions in order to come up with a more intelligent result.

* Platinum is certified to work with the iOS 7 version of Safari, and is available now on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. There are no options to configure, just install it and go.
* If you’re an avid Safari user, then this little tweak is something you should definitely check out. It greatly improves search on Safari, and makes searching work more like it does on the desktop.
* The whole concept is a bit difficult to explain without seeing it for yourself. I highly advise you to check out the video embedded above to see how you might benefit from this tweak. Let me know what you think about Platinum in the comment section below.
