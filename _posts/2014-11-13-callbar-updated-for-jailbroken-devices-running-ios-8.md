* Hot on the heels of a major iOS 7 revision, CallBar has been updated to play nice with iOS 8 and the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. CallBar is a tweak that makes it possible to make and take calls from anywhere on your device, even while engaged in using another app.
* CallBar is a great jailbreak tweak for those of you who feel that iOS’ stock calling features are intrusive. Have a look inside at our video walkthrough for more information on what makes this tweak a must-have.
* Since this update doesn’t add any new features to the mix, outside of a new option to answer calls using the CallBar menu while on the Lock screen, the iOS 7 video above still largely applies. Check it out for a detailed overview on CallBar and its features.
* It should be noted that while the update touts iOS 8 support and support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the tweak hasn’t been thoroughly tested on the 6 Plus as of yet. With that said, I’ve played with it on my 6 Plus, and haven’t seen any signs of issues.
* While CallBar works with non-iPhone iOS devices, such as the iPod touch 5th-gen and iPads, it’s much more beneficial when used with a phone. CallBar does work for FaceTime calls, though, so it can be used with an iPod or iPad if need be.
* CallBar is consistently one of my favorite tweaks that I use with my jailbroken phone. It’s a good example of what happens when a good designer—Joshua Tucker—meets a developer who’s handy with the code—Elias Limneos.
* What do you think about CallBar? Will you use it? If you’ve already purchased the previous version, then the update is free of charge. If you’re new to the mix, CallBar is $3.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Sound off in the comments down below.
