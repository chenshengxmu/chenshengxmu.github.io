* Right on cue, the App Store was refreshed this morning with new apps and games, revealing Apple’s new Free App of the Week: Motorsport Manager. Created by Christian West and originally released in August 2014, Motorsport Manager makes an immediately striking impression.
* Arguably one of the best racing simulations available on the iPhone and iPad, Motorsport Manager is available free of charge until next Thursday, good for a cool $1.99 savings.
* In Motorsport Manager, you hire drivers for your team, then create your car and invest in advanced racing technology that will help you achieve the perfect lap.
* You must formulate the ideal pitstop strategy to win races before you can sit back and relax, watching the race in real-time. If you feel like you need to take control of the action—for instance, to react to weather changes, crashes and safety car periods—the game lets you jump into the strategy screens at any time.
* Check out the promotional trailer embedded below.
* “Flashing across the finish line in first place takes so much more than great driving and in Motorsport Manager, you get the keys to the kingdom behind an open-wheel racing team,” reads a copy from Apple’s App Store editorial team.
* “Juggling budgets, hiring decisions and race-day strategies held us transfixed—will that rookie driver show she can be a star or will we get blasted by fans on social media again? With so many tough decisions and tantalizing near-misses, this robust sim has us determined to prove we have what it takes to make it to the procure—again and again”.
* The most recent version’s added new car color options, including red and black, improved performance on the iPad mini and added Brazilian Portuguese language support.
