* Today is a big day for Apple fans from around the world as the Cupertino firm telegraphed some interesting changes coming to its software platforms, among them tvOS, the operating system that powers the fourth-generation Apple TV. tvOS 10 is available now as a developer-only preview and everyone else will be permitted to install it on their set-top box this coming fall, said Apple.
* A developer preview of tvOS 10 is available today for those who are signed on the Apple Developer Program. Apple’s Public Beta Software program does not allow for tvOS betas so the general public will have to wait until this fall to check out these new features.
* As mentioned in our previous article, tvOS 10 includes improvements for the universal search feature, support for four MFi game controllers, Single Sign-On for video apps, a new dark mode, Automatic Downloads for Apple TV apps and more.
* Are you looking forward to tvOS 10?
* I’m pretty stoked about it.
