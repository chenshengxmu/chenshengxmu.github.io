* With over 200 new features in iOS 5, we keep bumping into some interesting stuff. The latest one is the Dictionary feature. Anywhere you see text (email, note, Safari, Twitter, etc…), you can tap the word as if you wanted to copy it. It will bring the new “Define” option.
* If you select “Define”, it will take you to a definition of the word…
* This is another handy feature of iOS 5.
