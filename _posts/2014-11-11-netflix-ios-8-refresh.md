* Netflix, a $7.99 per month over-the-top streaming video service, at last has gotten around updating its iPhone and iPad application for Apple’s latest mobile operating system.
* Released Tuesday, the new version is now optimized for iOS 8 while supporting 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display sizes of Apple’s latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, respectively.
* And if you own an iPhone 6 Plus and are a Netflix subscribers, you can now stream TV shows and movies in glorious full HD and enjoy 1080p content natively on that stunning Retina HD display.
* Netflix 7.0 is available for free in the App Store.
* The ability to stream shows in 1080p on the iPhone 6 Plus devices using Wi-Fi connections extends to Netflix originals like “Orange is the New Black” and “House of Cards”, said the firm.
* One caveat: 1080p streaming isn’t supported on the iPhone 6 due to its 4.7-inch screen that maxes out at 1,334-by-750 pixels, enough for 720p but not good enough for native 1080p rendering.
* “You’ll see more titles on screen to choose from, bigger imagery, and improved performance throughout,” said Netflix describing this update.
* And if you use Chromecast, Google’s $35 HDMI dongle that streams web video to your big screen TV, you should notice streaming improvements overall.
* Netflix 7.0 changelog
* Netflix is available across a myriad of mobile devices, computers, consoles and set-top boxes, starting at $7.99 per month (a free trial is available).
