* I would say ‘spoiler alert,’ but I’m sure it’s far too late for that. Photos of shells and components belonging to Apple’s fifth-generation tablet have been bouncing around the web since January of this year.
* But these new images offer an extremely clear look at the so-called iPad 5—perhaps the best we’ve seen thus far. And they give us a really good idea of what we can expect to see from Apple later this month…

* The photos come from Australian writer Sonny Dickson, who has been responsible for a number of accurate iPhone and iPad leaks over the years, and they depict the upcoming tablet’s casing and front panel.
* For those who haven’t been keeping up with the iPad rumors, the 9.7-inch slate is expected to get a significant redesign this year. The new case is supposedly thinner, with smaller bezels, similar to the iPad mini.

* In addition to its new looks, the tablet is also believed to be getting all-new internals. It’s said to feature the 64-bit A7 processor, 2GB of RAM and an 8MP camera. And it’s possible it could come with Touch ID.
* Of course, we should know all of this for sure in a couple of weeks. Yesterday, the credible AllThingsD website reported that Apple is planning told hold its iPad-centric event on Tuesday, October 22.
