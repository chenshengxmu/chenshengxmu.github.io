* Starting with iOS 9, there is now a standalone iCloud Drive app available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This application provides you with the same file picker interface that you see when accessing iCloud Drive from within other apps.
* The nice thing about having a native iCloud Drive app is that you can now access stored files, share them, and delete them, without relying on another app to act as a go-between.
* The iCloud Drive app in iOS is quite limited, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction when it comes to making the iPad, and iOS in general, more productivity friendly. Watch our full video walkthrough to see more.
* Upon initial setup of your iPad, you will be prompted to activate iCloud Drive. But don’t worry, if you decide not to and then change your mind, it’s extremely easy to enable the service.
* Step 1: Open Settings.
* Step 2: Tap iCloud.
* Step 3: Log in with your iCloud account if you haven’t already.
* Step 4: Tap iCloud Drive.
* Step 5: Use the switch that says Show on Home Screen
* If you’d like to disable iCloud Drive, simply use the switch referred to in Step 5.
* As I stated, the iCloud Drive app is very limited. There’s not much to do besides viewing, sharing, and deleting files stored there. Watch our video above for more usage details.
* What do you think about the iCloud Drive app in iOS? Are you happy about its potential?
