* Pinterest announced last night that it’s moving into new territory: travel. The popular photo-sharing service announced Place Pins, a new feature that will allow its users to share photos of the amazing places they’re visiting.
* That new feature is now available in the iOS app. And with it, users can essentially plan vacations by easily adding maps to their pin boards, as well as other useful travel information like hotel addresses and phone numbers…
* From the Pinterest blog:
* “Place Pins were designed to combine the beautiful imagery of a travel magazine with the utility of a map online so you can share it with friends. You can access them from anywhere on your smartphone, too, which means you can find new places on the go and even get directions!
* Place Pins also include extra details like the address and phone number right on the Pin so you can easily pull up useful info on a weekend adventure or before a night out.”
* The company says that the idea was born after they noticed Pinners were creating more boards around the vacations they were planning. In fact, they say about 1.5 million places are pinned each day, with around 750 million in total.
* Creating a board of Place Pins is easy. All you have to do is select ‘Add a map’ when you create a new board or edit one of your existing board’s settings. After that, you’ll be able to map out all of your new and existing Pins on the board.
* This is a pretty big deal—especially as Pinterest is trying to monetize. This could open up the door to a whole new business model for the company. At any rate, if you’d like to try out the new app, you can find it in the App Store for free.
