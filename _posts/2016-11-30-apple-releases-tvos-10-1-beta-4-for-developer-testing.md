* Two weeks after tvOS 10.1 beta 3, more than three weeks following beta 2 and more than a month since beta 1, Apple on Wednesday seeded a fourth beta of an upcoming tvOS 10.1 update to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.
* tvOS 10.1 beta 4 (build 14U588) is available as an over-the-air download on Apple TVs with a prior beta and an appropriate configuration profile installed.
* tvOS 10.1 is mostly a maintenance release that fixes bugs discovered since tvOS 10’s September debut, with two exceptions: it packs in Apple’s all-new channel guide app (view the slideshow here) and supports an upcoming new Single Sign-On feature.
* The TV app is a supercharged guide that surfaces shows and movies from all compatible apps (sans Netflix), combining them with your existing iTunes movies and rentals. Sports fans can even use Siri to tune in to live sports events.
* All you need to do is tell Siri to “turn on the game”. Siri knows which app has the game and takes you straight to the action. You can either request a specific game, like “the Cubs game,” or view a list all available streaming games.
* The app works in conjunction with Single Sign-On, another upcoming feature across tvOS and iOS platforms. With Single Sign-On, compatible apps can use your saved cable logins to save you from typing your passwords for each app. Launch Single Sing-On providers include DirecTV, Dish, Sling TV, Hotwire and GVTC Communications.
