* A trio of claimed spyshots were published this weekend by French blog NowhereElse.fr, ostensibly offering a first look at a fully assembled ‘iPhone 6s’ display with Force Touch technology. At first look, the part appears to be virtually unchanged from the front display assembly on the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in shape, size and overall design.
* Upon closer inspection, however, some differences become apparent. For instance, you’ll notice strange black dots running across the sides of a shielding which some folks say may or may not be related to Force Touch technology.
* While we don’t know whether or not the cutouts have something to do with a rumored layer of force sensors designed to distinguish between light and deep presses, like on the Apple Watch and the multi-touch trackpad of 2015 MacBooks, it’s worth mentioning that prior iPhones held on LCD shielding by screws and clips so this is definitely worth a discussion.

* There’s also a rectangular cutout which is now found toward the top of the screen, not centered as before, but this is most likely a grounding insert. These images were first published on the Chinese social network Weibo account which belongs to local repair firm GeekBar.
* A set of images of a claimed iPhone 6s prototype was also posted by M.I.C Gadget.
* As seen below, the device is virtually unchanged from the present generation, with no change to the ear speaker, mic or positioning of the cameras, with one difference: the phone is apparently an imperceptibly 0.2mm thicker due to Force Touch implementation.

* DigiTimes said last week that supplier TPK has begun shipping Force Touch iPhone parts to Apple in volume following a trial production run last month.
* The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are expected to be announced this September. The devices are said to feature a stronger Series 7000 aluminum chassis and the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch display sizes as the present-generation iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Other rumored features include a faster processor with 2GB of RAM, an updated Qualcomm baseband modem for up to twice as fast 4G LTE networking at 300Mbps, improved NFC, a more reliable Touch ID and likely a 5MP front-camera and a 12MP shooter with 4K video capture on the back.
