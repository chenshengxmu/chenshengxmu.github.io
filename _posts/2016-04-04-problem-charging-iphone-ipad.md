* Not only did Apple spend a ton of money and time in the research leading up to its proprietary reversible Lightning cable for charging, but they’ve also made the software that handles charging your iOS device intelligent too.
* Nevertheless, charging your device can sometimes be followed by some frustrating problems, and they’re all too common. In this piece, we’ll go over some of those problems and what you can do to troubleshoot them.
* When it comes to iOS devices, there are a number of issues that can arise. I can honestly say that I’ve experienced every single one of the issues I’m about ro cover, and as a result, I’d assume most of you have experienced at least one or more of the issues outlined below:
* If you’ve ever had any of these problems, you’ve come to the right article, because we’ll be talking about how to troubleshoot these issues and get your battery all charged up for a day’s worth of use.
* I’ve had scenarios with Apple’s OEM Lightning cables simply don’t get recognized by my iPhone or iPad when I plug it in, as well as with third-party Lightning cables. It seems to be some kind of fluke, but typically is pretty easy to fix.
* In some cases, the problem might not be with the device not charging at all, but rather with the device charging too slowly. Here are some things you can try in this scenario:

* If you ever get strange pop-up alerts on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad when you attempt to charge it with the inexpensive Lightning cable you just bought from Walmart, Ebay, or Amazon, you’re not alone. After all, Apple’s OEM replacements are expensive, and third-party cables are cheaper.
* The only problem with this is Apple has a little chip inside of the cables that the iOS device communicates with and it tells the device whether or not the cable is ‘Made for iPhone’ or MFi certified. If it’s not, you may get these little error messages every so often, and the wording sometimes varies depending on the scenario.
* Here’s what you can do:
* Hopefully you’ve been able to sort out your iOS device charging woes after following some of these tips.
* Charging glitches are far from uncommon on Apple-branded mobile devices, and I’m not saying they’re uncommon on other brands of mobile devices either, but from my experience I’ve had trouble with almost everything on this list at least once in my life. Nevertheless, it’s usually always something really stupid and easy to fix.
