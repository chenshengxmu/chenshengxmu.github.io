* Path users will be happy to hear that the social network has seeded an update to its iOS client today. The update, which brings the app to version 3.1.1, includes a handful of new features, as well as various improvements and bug fixes.
* One of the more noticeable changes in 3.1.1 is the updated Friend Progress Bar. Path introduced the feature, which helps users better track their friends’ stories, in the last update. And now, those that found it annoying can easily remove it…
* Here’s the full 3.1.1 change log:
* 3.1.1 – Updated Friend Progress Bar: Quickly remove it from your feed with a single tap. – Settings: Edit your email address and password in the Settings drawer, without having to leave the app. – Bug fixes. – New Stickers: — Adventure Time: With Jake the Dog and Finn the Human, the fun will never end. It’s Adventure Time! – New Filters: — Peacock: Inspired by the most beautifully embellished bird, this filter makes photos striking and vibrant. Brights become brighter, whites whiter. Things glitzy, gaudy, or gilded become resplendent.
* In addition to the updated Friend Progress Bar, today’s update also brings about new Settings options. You can now edit your email address and password from right within the app, which is huge in my opinion, as it really rounds out the client.
* The new stickers and other in-app store content don’t mean much to me, as I don’t use Path enough to buy stuff. But folks who do will likely appreciate the new choices. At any rate, you can find the latest version of Path in the App Store for free.
