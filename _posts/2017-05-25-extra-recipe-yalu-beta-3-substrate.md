* As many of you will by now be aware, the yalu+mach_portal tool for iOS 10.1(.1) is no more. Troubled as it was with stability issues stemming from the mach_portal exploit it used, many iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners struggled with it, or chose not to use it at all. Luckily, that struggle is now over, as an updated tool entitled extra_recipe+yaluX has been released.
* The extra_recipe project is the work of xerub, and resolves all of mach_portal’s stability issues with launchd and backboardd. While xerub’s code is available for perusal on GitHub, it requires compiling. Luca Todesco has therefore stepped in and made an .ipa available on the official Yalu website, so that end users can more easily obtain the new tool, and sideload it with Cydia Impactor. You can follow our guide on how to sideload the jailbreak app if you want to try it out.
* The first beta, which was posted a couple of days ago, did not install Cydia, run Substrate, or remount the filesystem as read-write, being essentially a packaged version of xerub’s code. It seems Todesco is adding more features as the betas progress, using his existing Yalu work in tandem with xerub’s updated exploit. This should mean that the tool eventually has all the features we associate with a full jailbreak.
* The process has already begun, with today’s Beta 3 now containing Cydia Substrate support. It also remounts the filesystem as read-write. I’d like to see a tfp0 patch come along at some point too, though it’s not clear whether that’s on the roadmap. It seems that although the extra_recipe exploit itself gets tfp0, it is not enabled by default as a patch in the final jailbreak. If it were to be added, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users would have the possibility of using futurerestore with saved . shsh2 blobs to upgrade to an unsigned firmware later, if a new jailbreak were released.
* If you’re on the fence as to whether or not to switch over from mach_portal yet, I’d advise waiting a little more, unless you know what you’re doing. Although the addition of Substrate is one of the major milestones for the average user to consider a jailbreak complete, there may still be improvements to be made. I think Beta 4 would be a good place to test the waters if you aren’t confident in your troubleshooting abilities. Having said that, I haven’t seen many reports of problems with Beta 3 as of yet either.
* With extra_recipe+yaluX all previous stability tweaks for mach_portal, such as Order 66, Order 65, CydiaRespringFix, Cake, and so on, are rendered unnecessary and can be uninstalled. For the best experience, I recommend using Extender: Reloaded to auto-sign your jailbreak app once you have it up and running to your satisfaction.
* Have you tried out extra_recipe+yaluX yet? Is your iOS 10.1-10.1.1 iPhone 7(+) thanking you for it? Let us know your results in the comments below.
