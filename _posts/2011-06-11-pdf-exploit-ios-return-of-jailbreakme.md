* We’re calling it, folks: famed jailbreak hacker, Comex, has uncovered another PDF exploit in iOS that will allow for a userland jailbreak, ala JailbreakMe.
* This is based off the above teaser image, which Comex just announced on his Twitter and is available for viewing on jailbreakme.com. If our detective work is correct, we expect a new, untethered, userland jailbreak for iOS.

* If you look at the above image, you’ll notice a few things, namely, the PDF and little diamond-shaped icon. The PDF is a clear and direct reference to the previous PDF exploit that Comex is already famous for, and the diamond references Alpine. “Alpine” is the default password for root access to the iPhone.
* One thing is for sure: something is cooking in the jailbreak department for iOS. Comex’s last exploit was patched by Apple in iOS 4.3.1, and he’s obviously been working on his next magic trick since then.
* The jailbreak could either be for iOS 4.3.3, or iOS 5. We’re unsure about that. And let’s not forget the iPad 2. Comex could be about to bring the first untethered jailbreak for that device as well.
* In the days of JailbreakMe, you could visit www.jailbreakme.com on your iPhone and jailbreak right from Mobile Safari. It was easy and simple. Those types of jailbreaks are referred to as “userland.” JailbreakMe was thanks to Comex’s last PDF exploit, that Apple has since patched.
* Another userland jailbreak for iOS 5 was hinted by Comex when 4.3 was introduced, but nothing has been heard since then. i0n1c’s untethered exploit has been stealing the limelight.
* It seems like it’s a little too late to introduce a new jailbreak for 4.3.3, so there’s a good possibility that Comex could be referencing a PDF exploit that he’s uncovered in the iOS Beta 1 SDK.
* Either way, it looks like we’ll be seeing the return of JailbreakMe very soon.
* Who’s excited?
