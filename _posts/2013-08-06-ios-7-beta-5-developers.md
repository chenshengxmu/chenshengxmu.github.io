* Apple has seeded iOS 7 beta 5 to developers this morning. The update comes just one week after the release of beta 4, as it appears that the company is trying to get back on track after the lengthy Developer Center outage.
* Beta 5 is available now to all registered Apple developers via the Dev Center and OTA, which can be installed by visiting the Software Update section in the Settings app of proper devices that currently have iOS 7 installed…
* The previous beta brought about a number of UI tweaks and changes throughout the operating system, but did not include any major features. It did, however, contain code references to the A7, and the rumored fingerprint sensor.
* The fifth beta is available for compatible iPhones, iPads and iPod touch models. We’re installing it ourselves, and will be reporting back with any new stuff we find. So make sure you keep checking back with us throughout the day.
* As always, we welcome you to let us know if we missed anything by e-mailing us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
* Today’s iOS 7.0 beta 5 (11A4449a) released to developers expires on Sunday, October 6, 2013 @ 12AM (GMT). #TheMoreYouKnow
