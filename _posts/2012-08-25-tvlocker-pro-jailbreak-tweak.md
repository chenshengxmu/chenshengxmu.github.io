* Some folks like to jailbreak their devices to add more functionality, and some folks do it just to change the look and feel of them. And if you happen to fall in the second category, you might be interested in this.
* TVLocker is a new jailbreak tweak that adds a bit of old-school flavor to the way you lock your iPhone or iPad. So instead of your device just fading to a black screen, you get a tube TV-style animation…
* Now, I realize there are other tweaks that do this — TV Tube Sleep comes to mind. But there’s more to TVLocker than that. For starters, it comes in both a free and paid (pro) version. The free version does everything the $.99 TV Tube Sleep does, for free. And the pro version adds a bit of customization.
* With TVLocker Pro, you can choose the color of the fadeout, as well as its opacity and speed. And if you’re going for authenticity, there’s a screenshot option that really looks like an old TV powering down.
* This seems like a lot of work to me for a simple sleep animation. But I’m not much for customizing my devices. If you are, then this is worth taking a look at. TVLocker is available in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for free ($.99 for pro).
