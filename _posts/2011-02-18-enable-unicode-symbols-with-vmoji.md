* Here comes another tweak! Although this tweak has been available for jailbroken iPhones for quite some time now, I seemed to stumble upon it earlier this week and found it pretty cool!
* With this tweak you’ll be able to use unicode symbols to spice up your social life. How does it work?  Simply hold down the 1-5 number keys and you will have access to universally viewable symbols that can be added to your text messages, tweets, and more.
* The best part is, unlike emoji which are only viewable on some devices, the unicode symbols in Vmoji will display correctly on any mobile device or computer. The tweak is also free of charge, so that’s another thumbs up…
* To get Vmoji:
* 1. Launch Cydia
* 2. Navigate to Manage > Sources > Edit > Add
* 3. Add this source: http://vintendo.com/
* 4. Then Search for “Vmoji MOD“
* 5. Install the package and Restart Springboard
* Keep in mind this tweak is still in beta, so there might be some bugs, although I have not encountered any so far.
* Be sure to let us know how you like it!
