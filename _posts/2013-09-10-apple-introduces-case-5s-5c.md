* In addition to the new 2 meter Lightning cable and its two new charging docks, Apple also unveiled today new custom cases for its new handsets. There’s a fun plastic one for the iPhone 5c, and a sharp-looking leather one for the 5s, and both are available in various colors…
* The 5c cases are made of silicon, with a microfiber lining, and have cutouts in the lower half so that the phone’s body still shows. You can choose a color that matches your 5c, or combine colors to mix it up. Six different cases will available for the 5c and they’ll cost $29 a piece.

* As for the 5s cases, they’re $39. And here’s Apple’s product description:
* “iPhone 5s has a stunning exterior. So any case that dares to conceal it should be equally appealing. The Apple-designed leather cases more than meet the requirement. Made from premium leather, they look and feel luxurious. And because they’re precision crafted for iPhone 5s, your phone still feels incredibly slim even with the case on.”
* If you’re interested, you can find the 5c cases in Apple’s online store. Both show unavailable for shipping at this time, but say that they can be picked up in a store on September 20—the date that both phones will be available for purchase.
* Anyone planning on picking up one of these cases?
