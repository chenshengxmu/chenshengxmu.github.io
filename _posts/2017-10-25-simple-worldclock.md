* If you keep track of several time zones around the globe, then the World Clock tab in the native Clock app can be your best friend. Nevertheless, it takes an effort to find, launch, and check the Clock app whenever you want to know what time it is in another part of the world.
* Enter Simple WorldClock, a new free jailbreak tweak by iOS developer NeinZedd9 that puts all your World Clocks under the large time display on the Lock screen.
* After installing the tweak, you won’t notice anything different about the Lock screen at first glance. The time display looks exactly how it always did, and smaller text beneath it indicates the day of the week and the date.
* Things get interesting when you begin tapping to the left or right of the time display; doing so cycles you between all the World Clocks you’ve configured inside the native Clock app:

* As it would seem, you can set as many World Clocks from the Clock app as you want and Simple WorldClock lets you see every one of them from the Lock Screen without fuss.
* The tweak also adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure a few options:

* Here, you can:
* Any changes you make take effect immediately without a respring, so you can quickly look back and see how the tweak impacts your device.
* If you frequently communicate with people around the world, then Simple WorldClock might be of use to you. The tweak is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 7, 8, 9, and 10 devices.
