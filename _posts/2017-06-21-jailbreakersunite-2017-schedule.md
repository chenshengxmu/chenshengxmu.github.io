* At the beginning of June, we shared the news of a new conference called JailbreakersUnite, which will allow avid jailbreakers to meet up with one another and have an opportunity to listen to prominent community members speak about their projects.
* The event, which is taking place at the Fat Cat Fab Lab Maker Space in Greenwich Village in New York City, will be like a slimmed-down WWJC and will allow participants to mingle with those with similar interests and grab selfies with famous jailbreak hackers and developers.
* At the time of the announcement, little was known about the event or what would be going on there. Fortunately, the organizer has officially worked up a full day-to-day schedule that details who will be speaking at JailbreakersUnite and when, in addition to other events.
* The current schedule looks something like this:
* As you’ve probably noticed, there will be a competition on Sunday. This competition will allow jailbreaker attendees to show off their jailbroken device setups for the chance to win prizes – the person that receives the most votes for the coolest setup will be deemed the winner.
* If you’re planning on going, you’ll want to grab your tickets as soon as possible because they’ll be flying off the shelves. A ticket to attend both days (Saturday and Sunday) is available for $15, while a $10 ticket option is also available if you plan to attend only on Saturday or on Sunday rather than both days.
* If you have any questions pertaining to JailbreakersUnite, or would like to schedule yourself in as a last-minute speaker, you should contact the event organizers via email as soon as possible.
