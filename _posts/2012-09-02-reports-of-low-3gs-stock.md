* If previous reports hold true, Apple will unveil its next-generation smartphone at a media event on Wednesday, September 12. It’s expected to feature a larger screen, and a number of other improvements.
* In addition to the new handset, it’ll also be interesting to see what Apple does with the rest of its iPhone lineup. According to a new report, Apple Stores are starting to see very low stock of 3GS models…
* 9to5Mac has the scoop:
* “Ahead of Apple’s likely September 12th iPhone-related media event, Apple has warned its retail store Genius Bars of low iPhone 3GS stock. According to a note sent to Genius Bar employees worldwide, “until further notice,” Genius Bars should perform the following for iPhone 3GSs: screen repairs, discuss the advantages of buying a new iPhone, and lastly, swapping out the full iPhone 3GS hardware…
* …With supplies of the iPhone 3GS so low, Apple even tells employees to swap out affected 3GSs with an iPhone 4 replacement unit. That is if the particular store is completely out of the 3GS…”
* This is interesting because Apple included the iPhone 3GS in its list of compatible iOS 6 handsets, leading some folks to believe it planned to keep it around. But the model is over three years old.
* So what happens to the other devices if the 3GS disappears? The lineup could look something like this:
* Obviously, this is just speculation at this point. But where would the 3GS fit in if Apple followed previous trends and dropped the prices on its older handsets by $100? Maybe it could keep it around as an inexpensive prepaid option, or sell it unlocked on its website for two or three hundred dollars.
* What do you think Apple will do with the iPhone 3GS?
