* Facebook’s mainland mobile app for iPhone and iPad is being updated later today with the ability to take 360-degree photos, publish them on the service like you would regular images and even set panoramic shots as your profile’s cover photo, TechCrunch has learned.
* Though Facebook has supported panoramic photos taken with the stock Camera app for some time now, today’s update lets you snap 360-degree photographs from within the app.
* To take a panoramic image, launch the mobile Facebook app and tap a new 360 Photo option from the top of your News Feed where you update your status.
* Now tap the blue shutter button and follow the onscreen path from start to finish until you’ve taken a complete panorama. Upon taking a 360-degree photo, you can choose your preferred starting view within the image for display when it’s been posted to the service.

* Panoramic photos can be added to groups.
* Like with other images, friends can be tagged on them and you can easily share panoramic photographs in your Facebook albums alongside other regular images.
* When shared on Facebook, 360-degree photos can be panned around, zoomed and more. As I mentioned, panoramic shots (from any source) can now be set as your profile’s cover photo.
* This is a staggered release for iOS and Android users so check back in a few days if the new 360 Photo option has not yet appeared within the mobile app for you.
* Facebook for iOS is available free on App Store.
