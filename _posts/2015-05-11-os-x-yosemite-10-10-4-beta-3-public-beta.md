* In addition to seeding iOS 8.4 beta 3 to its registered developers, Apple this morning also released OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 beta 3 to public beta testers and developers. The pre-release software carries a build number of 14E17e and should be released ahead of WWDC in June, alongside iOS 8.4 which includes an all-new Music app and other new features.
* According to release notes, Apple is asking public beta testers and developers to focus on any issues with the stock Photos app, Migration Assistant as well as Arabic and Hebrew localization.
* The update arrives two weeks following OS X 10.10.4 beta 2, three weeks after releasing the first OS X 10.10.4 beta and less than a month to go before Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference.
* In addition to OS X 10.10.4 beta 3 and iOS 8.4 beta 3, Apple also released today the second Public Beta of iOS 8.4 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and Xcode 6.4 beta 3 for developers.
* Unlike OS X 10.10.3 which brought out a new Photos for Mac app, a revamped emoji picker with racially diversified emoticons and other enhancements, OS X 10.10.4 brings mostly performance enhancements and bug fixes.
* Registered Mac developers can install the update through Apple’s Dev Center. Users on Apple’s AppleSeed program who are running an earlier beta can apply the OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 beta 3 update through the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. You can get on the program through the Apple Beta Software Program website.
* Apple is scheduled to update its developers on the next major versions of iOS and OS X at its summer conference, which kicks off on June 8.
