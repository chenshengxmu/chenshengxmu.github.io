* This past Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook may be required to testify in an antitrust lawsuit the United States Department of Justice filed against it and major e-book publishers over an alleged price fixing of e-books. Reuters confirms today that U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan granted the Justice Department’s request to compel Cook to sit for a deposition.
* The Judge said the death of Jobs was a key reason in ordering the deposition. Cook will be testifying for four hours in the lawsuit, a risky move for the CEO and potentially damaging to Apple. The Cupertino company is now the main target of the suit after all named publishers had settled with regulators…
* According to Reuters:
* The government had argued Cook likely had relevant information about Apple’s entry into the e-books market. It also said Cook likely had conversations related to e-books with former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.
* Apple called Cook’s testimony “cumulative and duplicative,” reminding the court that the government had already deposed eleven other Apple executives.
* Judge Cole wasn’t impressed and sited late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs death as a key reason in ordering the deposition. “Because of that loss,” Cole said, “I think the government is entitled to take testimony from high-level executives within Apple about topics relevant to the government case.”
* Rather than request damages, the government wants to establish that Apple violated antitrust law so it could order the company not to engage in similar conduct in the future.
* The Government alleges Apple conspired with major e-book publishers to fix prices on the iBookstore by demanding they don’t undercut iBookstore pricing on competing stores. Publishers who agreed to Apple’s policy simply raised e-book prices on Amazon, prompting DoJ to intervene and file an antitrust lawsuit in April 2012.
* A trial is set for June 2013.
* A trial is set for June. The government is not requesting damages but is seeking a finding that Apple violated antitrust law and an order blocking it from engaging in similar conduct.
