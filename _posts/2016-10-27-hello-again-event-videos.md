* Apple has posted various videos shown during today’s ‘hello again’ Mac event to its YouTube channel. Included are clips highlighting Apple’s commitment to Accessibility features and various MacBook Pro demos and promotional spots.
* Of course you can watch a replay of the entire event, so folks that completely missed the keynote this morning may want to do that. But if you just want to get to the meat of the big announcements, these videos are a great starting point.
