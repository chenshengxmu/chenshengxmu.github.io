* macOS allows users to create new folders with pre-selected items, and to be honest, it’s one of my favorite features of the Finder. All you need to do is highlight the items you want to place in a folder, right click, and execute the command. It makes cleaning up files extremely quick and easy, and I find myself using it on a daily basis.
* Step 1: highlight the files and/or folders that you wish to place into a new folder
* Step 2: right-click while the items are selected, and click New Folder with Selection.

* At the end of the New Folder with Selection text, you’ll see the number of items that will be placed in the folder inside parentheses.
* Step 3: type the name of the new folder and press Return on the keyboard

* You can also use a keyboard shortcut to combine all selected files into a folder
* Step 1: highlight the files you wish to place into a folder
* Step 2: press Control+Command+N on your keyboard
* The keyboard shortcut has a slight benefit over using the right-click action, as the keyboard shortcut allows you to place a single file into a new folder as well. If you want to undo the new folder and move the item(s) back to their original location, just execute an undo command (Command+Z).
* Not only is the New Folder With Selection feature extremely handy for quickly organizing files, it’s accompanied by a pretty sweet looking animation as well. Features like this is why I adore macOS so much, in case you couldn’t already sense my admiration.
* What do you think about this feature? Do you use it?
