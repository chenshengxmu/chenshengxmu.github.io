* Yahoo in September released its Screen iOS app. Billed as a remote control for web video with true AirPlay multitasking, the iPhone and iPad application acts as a one-stop shop for a bunch of web video sources, including licensed programming from Viacom and other Yahoo partners.
* Today, Yahoo announced the arrival of Yahoo Screen for Apple TV. Provided as a new channel on your set-top box’s main menu, Yahoo Screen lets Apple TV owners watch live news and events, stream such premium third-party shows as Saturday Night Live, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and content from MLB, UFC, The Onion, Martha Stewart, as well as enjoy Yahoo’s original programming, all from the comfort of their couch…
* According to Yahoo, this is just the beginning of their effort “to bring you the best possible video experience”.

* Additionally, Peter Kafka of AllThingsD reported that The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), an American broadcast television network, has created an Apple TV channel which lets users “watch some, but not all, of its shows” free of charge, as well as previews of upcoming programming.

* First, you’ll need to activate your Apple TV for use with PBS by entering the on-screen activation code at pbs.org/activate. In order to gain full access to PBS on your Apple TV, you’ll have to sign in with a Facebook, Google+ or PBS account.
* After activating your device and signing up for an account, quit the app and fire it up again – you should see the main screen like this. Downtown Abbey, you say? You’ll need an Amazon Prime subscription for that since the online retailer holds exclusive rights to stream that show.
* I know, it’s a bummer – but you can’t have it all.

* The network gives you access to over 5,000 hours of content, without requiring any subscription with a stupid cable company, which will appeal to cable-cutters. A spokesperson for PBS confirmed that “many programs will be available for viewing within 24 hours of their broadcast,” adding this concerning Downtown Abey:
* Our stations are re-airing Downton Abbey season 2 and 3 through December. Each of these episodes — as well as new Season 4 episodes beginning in January—will be available for a limited window following the on-air broadcast.
* These “apps” (I’m using the term loosely here) are being pushed out over-the-air to your $99 set-top box as we speak. To update manually, go to Settings > General > Software Updates and hit Update Software.
