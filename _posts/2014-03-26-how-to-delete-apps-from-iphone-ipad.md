* I know what you’re thinking. We all know how to delete an app from iPhone. Simply tap and hold your finger on an app icon until it starts wiggling, then tap the small x mark to delete it for good. That is one method to do it. But there is another way, which arguably can be quicker, depending on what your intentions are.
* I routinely go through the folders and pages of my iPhone to delete apps that I don’t use at all, or simply apps that I don’t intend to use in the foreseeable future. I’m kind of a neat freak like this. My motto is “if you don’t use it, delete it.” I typically go through each folder and page of apps and tap on the x mark, then confirm that I do want to delete the app.
* I recently stumbled upon a way to have a quick look at all the apps installed on your device, allowing you to delete undesired apps faster.
* Before we go any further, let’s get one thing straight. If you just need to delete one app, then the usual way is still the best way to go. However, if like me you like to go through a massive cleaning spree from time to time, then read on…
* Of course, there is the basic way of deleting apps that everybody probably already knows, but for those who might not, here is how to proceed:
* 1) On your iPhone or iPad, tap and hold your finger on an app icon until all icons start wiggling.

* 2) You will see a little X mark at the upper left corner of each icon. Tap this little X mark to delete an icon.
* 3) You will then best asked to confirm the deletion. Tap “Delete” to confirm and the app will be deleted from your iPhone or iPad.
* First, go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. Here you’ll be presented with a list of all apps installed on your iPad or iPhone. This is definitely not a new feature. This has been around for a while, and it is actually a good way to see how much storage space each app is taking on your device. Note that apps are sorted by amount of storage space they take on your device. It’s obviously not unusual to see the Music, Photos, and Videos apps near the top.
* You should see a screen that looks something like that.

* The best thing about this is that you have direct access to all apps installed on your device in one page. You don’t have to go through all your folders to see what you have installed. This is to my knowledge the best way to see all the apps you have on your device in a simple and convenient location.
* Scrolling through all apps installed on your device, if you find one that you want to get rid of, tap on it, and then tap the Delete App. Confirm that you want to delete the app and it will be gone.

* You can repeat the process for all other apps on your iPhone or iPad.
* Again, this method is best used when you want to go through a massive app deletion. If all you want to do is delete one single app, then you’re better off using the good ol’ way of deleting apps.
