* Apple on Thursday added five new clips to the World Gallery films section of its ‘Shot on iPhone 6’ microsite. The company launched the Shot on iPhone 6 campaign in March, showcasing beautiful photos and videos taken with its latest smartphone.
* The new videos are very similar to the previous entries, in that they are 15 seconds long and accompanied by an analogous soundtrack. They were captured by photographers from around the world, and show what the iPhone 6 is capable of.

* Unlike the photos section of the World Gallery, Apple doesn’t mention any editing applications, suggesting the videos are untouched. The stock Camera app in iOS offers several video-related features, including slow motion capture and time-lapse.
* In June, Apple took home the top prize in the Outdoor Lions category at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The annual event, often referred to as the world’s biggest advertising festival, features thousands of ads from around the world.
