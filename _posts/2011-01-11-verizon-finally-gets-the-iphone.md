* After months years of anticipation, the iPhone is finally coming to Verizon.
* Lowell McAdam took the stage this morning and after making an introduction touting the merits of his network, Verizon’s COO, he finally dropped the bomb that everyone expected: the Verizon iPhone.
* Our relationship with Apple has developed over the last two years. In 2008 we started talking about bringing the iPhone to a CDMA network. We spent a year testing. Late in 2010 we started offering the iPad… today, we are extremely gratified to announce that the iPhone 4 will be available early next month.
* More to come in a minute… Stay tuned!
