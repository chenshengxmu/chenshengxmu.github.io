* Have you ever ventured into the App Store expecting a new update, only to find that the update has not yet appeared? Since the App Store has no refresh button, I used to force close the app, and reopen it to check for new updates.
* There’s an even easier way to refresh the App Store. I’m not sure if it was purposely done, or if it’s a bug, or what. All I know is that this refresh trick works on iOS 8 and newer versions of the software, but it doesn’t appear to work on lesser firmware.
* Inside, I’ll show you how to quickly refresh the App Store and check for new updates in a flash. Check out the video.
* So here’s what you need to do to force refresh the App Store:
* Step 1: Launch the App Store app.
* Step 2: Tap any tab 10 times.
* Step 3: Watch as the App Store refreshes.
* See? It’s that easy. There are some points of note, however:
* True enough, this isn’t exactly mind blowing, but it’s a trick I’ve been using for some time now, and it’s always like a little reward when a badge appears on the Updates tab after I use this trick to refresh the App Store.
* What do you think? Will you make this trick a part of your repertoire? Let me know in the comments.
