* Among the third-party retailers that sell Apple’s handset, Walmart typically has some of the lowest prices. In fact, it’s been selling 16GB versions of the iPhone 4S for just $188 since last November. And it looks like it’s about to get a lot cheaper.
* Cult of Mac has learned that Walmart is dropping the price of Apple’s latest smartphone (AT&T model) down to $114 with a 2-year agreement. It also appears that the retail chain is lowering the price of its 8GB iPhone 4 as well, down to $34.
* Unfortunately, discounts were a glitch in the system, Walmart confirmed in an official statement…
* UPDATE [May 4, 2102 at 11:35am]: Walmart’s iPhone sales has been a mistake, a company spokesperson told 9to5Mac:
* Walmart just responded to 9to5Mac’s inquiry and said the retail chain “experienced a pricing error in limited stores” yesterday. The company spokesperson said the issue has been addressed and normal prices are now in effect: 16GB iPhone 4S for $188, iPhone 4 for $88, and iPhone 3GS for $0.97.
* The rest of our original post follows right below.
* Before you get too excited, we aren’t sure which — or how many — locations are offering these prices. The flyer you see above comes from a Walmart in Edmond, Oklahoma. My local Walmart here in Oregon doesn’t seem to be participating, and Walmart.com still shows $188 with the customary “Store prices may vary” warning.
* It’s fairly interesting that the retailer is able to offer such big discounts on two of Apple’s most popular handsets. Sometimes, price cuts like this can indicate a product refresh, but we’re all but certain we won’t see a new iPhone until the fall.
* At any rate, if you’re in the market for a new iPhone, it’s worth checking out the prices at your local Walmart. You could save some big bucks.
* Have you noticed the price drop at your local Walmart?
