* Hot off the heels of Thursday’s RedSn0w iOS 5.1 compatibility update comes Sn0wBreeze v2.9.2, which makes the popular Windows jailbreak tool compatible with iOS 5.1.
* If you’re familiar with previous iterations of Sn0wBreeze, then you’re not going to find any surprises here. It’s still about creating a custom IPSW and restoring via iTunes to accomplish the jailbreak.
* One of the advantages that you have with Sn0wBreeze is that it will preserve your baseband for those interested in maintaining an existing unlock.
* This updated for Sn0wBreeze is compatible with A4 devices and below, and is of course, a tethered jailbreak. Check out more details inside…
* Here is the change log for ih8sn0w’s latest jailbreak tool update:
* Again Sn0wBreeze is not compatible with A5 devices such as the iPhone 4S or the iPad 2. The reason for that is described below:
* A low level (DFU/iBoot/LLB) exploit is required to start the restoration of custom IPSWs. The past two jailbreaks (JailbreakMe & absinthe) for the A5 worked within iOS itself. These exploits are not capable of bringing the iDevice into a state where it will accept custom IPSWs. Therefore, an A5 device cannot currently downgrade to an iOS revision that Apple is no longer signing (even with SHSH blobs) and it cannot preserve the baseband when updating to a newer iOS revision.
* Head over to ih8sn0w’s blog for more info on this latest update, and be sure to visit our dedicated Sn0wBreeze page for a full walkthrough on how to use this excellent dedicated Windows tool.
* Are you going to jailbreak your device on iOS 5.1, or are you staying put on an older firmware?
