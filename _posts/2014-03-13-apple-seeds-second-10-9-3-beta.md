* Apple has seeded the second OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The release comes one week after Apple released the first beta of 10.9.3, which added enhanced 4K display support.
* The new beta build is available to registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a complete download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what changes we should expect to see in the new version of Mavericks, but Apple has thus far asked developers to specifically focus on graphic drivers and audio in today’s beta.
* The first beta, released last Thursday, added a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays. Today’s build is labeled as 13D17, and we’ll be sure to let you know if it includes anything new of note.
