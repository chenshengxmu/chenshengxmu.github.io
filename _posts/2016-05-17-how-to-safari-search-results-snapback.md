* SnapBack, a long-standing and very easily overlooked Safari for Mac feature, can save you a ton of clicks if you search a lot, and most of us do. With SnapBack, you can go right back to the last full search results page, even after traveling multiple pages in from your search results.
* Part of the reason most users aren’t familiar with SnapBack has to do with Apple’s decision to remove the little orange SnapBack icon from Safari’s address bar and bury the feature  in the menus.
* Here’s that secret SnapBack shortcut that everyone should start using right now.
* 1) Launch Safari on your Mac and run a search by typing your query into the Smart Search field, or visit Google.com or some other search engine and run your searches there.
* 2) Click an item in your search results. Navigate from that page to another, then to another and so forth.
* 3) Now select the Safari window or tab where you previously searched, then choose Search Results SnapBack in Safari’s History menu, or press the Option (⌥)-Command (⌘)-S keyboard combination.
* And boom, just like that you’ll be taken right back to the last full search you performed, landing on the first page of your search results. If you have multiple Safari windows or tabs open, the search results displayed are for the active window or tab.
* This will save you having to click Safari’s Back button multiple times.
* SnapBack supports any search engine that you can set as your default in Safari, including Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo. This feature does not work in Safari for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
