* Rename II is an application available in Cydia that allows you to rename your stock and jailbreak apps.
* I first heard of Rename on AIS and I thought I should look into it a little more:
* To change the name of an application, just select it from the list. You will then get a pop-up where you can enter what you would like the new title of the app to be. Once you are finished renaming the app you can select Ok and then hit the Home Button, your device will respring and the apps will be renamed on your SpringBoard.
* You can even rename your apps using Emoji icons. Pretty cool, huh?
* To install Rename II, you will have to add the SOSiPhone source to Cydia: http://cy.sosiphone.com/
* Tell us what you think about this app!
