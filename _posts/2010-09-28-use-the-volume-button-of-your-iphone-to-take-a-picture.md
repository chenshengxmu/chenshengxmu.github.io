* Some of you may already know FastSnap, an application that was previously available on Rock, which was recently migrated to Cydia. FastSnap allows you to easily capture a photo or video inside the camera.app using the volume button of your iPhone.
* FastSnap also comes with a few other handy settings. With FastSnap you can also silent the shutter sound when taking a picture. This feature can be enabled from the Settings menu. To quickly launch the default camera app you can also drag your finger over the top Status barâ€¦ All these settings can easily be tweaked from the settings.app of your iPhone.
* FastSnap is available in Cydia for $0.99. Have you tried it? If so, what do you think?
