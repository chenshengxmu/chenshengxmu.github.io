* Although the beta version of iOS 7 is already available to registered developers, it was announced today that the public version won’t be available until this Fall, presumably around the same time the new iPhone will be released.
* The question that might come to your mind is “will my device be supported?” Chances are it will…
* Here is the list of devices that will support iOS 7 once it is available:
* Apple also posted a feature compatibility list:
* Features are subject to change. Not all features are available on all devices.
* Panorama format is available on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, and iPod touch (5th generation). Square and video formats and swipe to capture are available on iPhone 4 or later, iPad (3rd generation or later), iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation).
* Filters in Camera are available on iPhone 5 and iPod touch (5th generation). Filters in Photos are available on iPhone 4 or later, iPad (3rd generation or later), iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation).
* AirDrop is available on iPhone 5, iPad (4th generation), iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation) and requires an iCloud account.
* Siri is available on iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad with Retina display, iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation) and requires Internet access. Siri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Cellular data charges may apply. New female and male voices will be available initially in U.S. English, French, and German.
* Find My iPhone enables you to locate iOS devices only when they are on and connected to a registered Wi-Fi network or have an active data plan. Some features may not be available for all countries or all areas.
* If your device isn’t supported, maybe it means it’s time to upgrade the hardware.
