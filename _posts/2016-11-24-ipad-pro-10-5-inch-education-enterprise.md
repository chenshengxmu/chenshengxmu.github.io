* Apple may position its rumored new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model as the go-to tablet in the education and enterprise markets, if a report Tuesday in DigiTimes is anything to go by. The Taiwanese trade publication learned from Asian supply chain makers that the Cupertino firm’s decided to add a new screen size to the lineup because existing 9.7-inch models proved too small and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro too expensive for business users and students.
* DigiTimes writes:
* Apple is launching the 10.5-inch iPad mainly because 10-inch and larger tablets have been popular among enterprises and the education sector in the US, the sources said. Its existing 9.7-inch iPad may be too small and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro too expensive for such procurement, the sources indicated.
* The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be reportedly outfitted with an in-house designed A10X chip, a higher-clocked version of the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip with additional graphics cores. The same chip should be used in a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, too.
* Shipments of 10.5-inch iPads will reach two million units in the first quarter of next year and may reach five to six million units in the year, the sources said.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first reported in August and October of this year that Apple might add a brand new form factor to the iPad Pro family with a new screen size measuring at either 10.1 or 10.5 inches diagonally.
* DigiTimes adds that Apple will also launch lower-priced 9.7-inch iPads to “compete with Android models.” If I’m reading this correctly, 2017 iPad lineup will focus on 9.7, 10.5 and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models while the existing 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 will get a price cut to “compete with Android models.”
* Another possibility: Apple kills the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and instead aims a third-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro at consumers, with 10.5 and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models focused on education and enterprise markets.
* I don’t think Apple should fragment iOS devices with new screen sizes just because Android makers are doing the same thing, but it may in fact be a good idea to create a new display size falling somewhere between current 9.7 and 12.9-inch iPad Pros.
* As much as I wanted to own a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, I’ve managed to resist buying it because every time I grab this thing and hold it in my hands I realize it’s just too humongous a piece of glass to be carrying around comfortably.
* On the other hand, I sold my iPad Air 2 because its form factor was increasingly becoming inadequate for my needs and I needed more pixels for comfortable side-by-side multitasking because I suffer from vision problems.
* I’m very excited for this new iPad Pro screen size.
