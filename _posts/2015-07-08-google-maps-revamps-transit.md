* Google Maps for iOS has been refreshed in the App Store with a trio of useful new features ahead of a brand new native Street View for iOS app due in mid-August.
* Google Maps for iPhone and iPad now sports revamped public transport directions while adding new choices for alternate routes and real-time data about your arrival time.
* Newly added sharing features include options to post Google Maps locations to Facebook and send map URLs to your Facebook Messenger friends. There’s also a brand new image gallery which presents various photos of a location in a grid view.
* Real-time information about arrival times, which went live in Google Maps for Android about a month ago, is now available to iOS customers. Google Maps will even alert you if a business will be closed by the time you arrive.
* A month ago, Google announced its imagery products will be streamlined soon, with their pro photographer tools and the Street View brand bringing out some rather interesting enhancements come this August.
* For starters, the Photo Sphere Camera iOS app will be replaced by a new native Street View for iOS app which will present your own profile and photo spheres alongside those from Google and other contributors.
* In addition, Street View for iOS will support Google’s photo sphere camera mode and will link to spherical cameras, including the NCTech iris360 and the Giroptic 360cam.
* In mid-August, you’ll be able to upload photo spheres directly from the Google Maps website. Later in the year, Google will enable a more automated solution for creating connections between photo spheres and your Views profile.
* Images from your Views profile, including those that have not been approved for Google Maps, will continue to be hosted on Google+. “All of your existing, Maps-approved photos, photo spheres and constellations will continue to be visible — and deletable — through the Google Maps website,” said the Internet giant.
* Last but not least, the certified photographer program called Google Maps Business View will be rebranded as “Street View | Trusted” while introducing more relaxed policies to support easier enrollment, simpler publishing requirements and more reliable publishing and editing functionality.
* Google Maps 4.8 changelog:
* The 28.8-megaybyte download requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and is optimized for the native display resolution of the iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices.
* Grab Google Maps free in the App Store.
