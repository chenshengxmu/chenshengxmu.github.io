* I woke up this morning to a pleasant surprise: Mobile Substrate had been updated to support iOS 7 on ARM64 CPUs, making it compatible with all of the latest Apple devices like the iPhone 5s, iPad Air, and iPad mini with Retina Display. As you can imagine, I rushed to the office without even brushing my teeth (I know, gross) and installed the new Cydia Substrate package that appeared on Cydia.
* Unfortunately for me, none of the tweaks and apps that I had installed began to work after Cydia Substrate was updated. I think it may, and I’m just grasping at straws here, have to do with the fact that I was impatient, and already had a bunch of stuff installed that didn’t work in the first place. To fix this issue, I took a fairly logical approach; I completely uninstalled Substrate and reinstalled it from scratch. Have a look inside for more details.
* Step 1: Uninstall Cydia Substrate and Substrate Safe Mode
* This should completely remove Cydia Substrate and any of its dependancies. This means that many of the tweak and apps, if not all of them, will be removed from your device. This is okay, we’ll reinstall them later.
* Step 2: Reinstall Cydia Substrate
* This will automatically pull in Substrate Safe Mode along with it.
* Step 3: Install a known working tweak
* I recommend using Barrel, because I can vouch for it working on 64-bit devices.
* Here’s our video showing Cydia Substrate working with Barrel:
* Afterwards, you can start reinstalling any other tweaks and apps that you rely on. Remember, though, that if they haven’t been updated to support the hardware in Apple’s newest devices, then they may not work.
* Let me know if this was able to help you at all in the comment section below. Now, it’s time to break out that toothbrush.
