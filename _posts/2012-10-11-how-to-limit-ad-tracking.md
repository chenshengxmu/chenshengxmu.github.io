* There’s been a lot of talk recently regarding advertisers tracking iOS users, more or less, without their knowledge. Not long ago, we showed you how to opt out of Verizon and AT&T’s info-sharing program.
* But even if you’ve withdrawn your device from carrier data tracking systems, there’s a good chance that advertisers are still watching you through Apple’s iAd network. So if that concerns you, here’s what to do.
* There’s two things you can do on your iOS device to limit the amount of your information that gets shared with advertisers (this is in addition to the aforementioned carrier opt-out). And they’re both super simple.
* The first one is merely a setting you can toggle on in iOS. We touched on this feature a bit back in early September, but with all of the recent talk of ad tracking, we figured it was worth mentioning again.
* Step 1: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising
* Step 2: Toggle the Limit Ad Tracking feature to ‘On’
* Doing this will ensure that apps don’t use your device’s Advertising Identifier (the new UDID) to serve you targeted ads.
* And that’s all there is to it! The main thing to remember here is that this won’t turn off advertisements in apps or through Safari — you’ll still see them. This will just make them less personal (and creepy?).
* For what it’s worth, I haven’t done either of these things on my iPhone yet. I figure if I’m going to see ads anyway, why not make them pertinent? It is weird though, to think they could be watching. me. right. now.
* Any questions? Thoughts on ad tracking?
