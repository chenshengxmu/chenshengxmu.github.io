* Leak aggregator SlashLeaks today published a claimed photograph of the purported iPhone 8 user manual that seemingly “confirms” the device’s rumored bezel-less design with a physical slit at the top of its 5.8-inch OLED display for the earpiece, the camera and sensors.
* The photograph was originally posted on China’s popular social network Weibo by a source with a sketchy track record so best thing you take this report with a grain of salt.
* There don’t seem to be any signs that the image has been doctored.
* While we cannot vouch for the veracity of this photo, it does appear to match up nicely with Apple’s design style for iPhone packaging paperwork, showing standard instructions for inserting a SIM card via the slot on the right side of the device, just like with iPhone 7.
* The iPhone’s signature top and bottom “chin” is nowhere to be seen on the photo.
* An elongated Power button is clearly visible on the right side of the device though it apparently won’t accommodate a Touch ID sensor.
* The device lacks a physical Home button and looks narrower and taller than existing iPhone models, supporting the theory that iPhone 8 may feature the industry-highest screen to body ratio at 18:9 (or 2:1), a major change from the current 16:9 iPhone screen ratio.
