* Chevrolet, a General Motors-owned brand, today announced bringing both CarPlay and Android Auto platforms to as many as fourteen new vehicles for the 2016 model year.
* Offering CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility in more models than any automotive brand, General Motors said its all-new 2016 Cruze compact car is among the fourteen new vehicles getting CarPlay compatibility. Cruze, which will debut on June 24, is Chevrolet’s best-selling passenger car, with more than three million units sold since launch.
* Both CarPlay and Android Auto will be accessible through Chevrolet’s seven-inch MyLink infotainment system, with eight-inch units receiving CarPlay upgrades at the beginning of the 2016 model year.
* A Projection icon will pop up on the MyLink screen when you connect your iPhone to USB using a Lightning cable. Many CarPlay features can be controlled via Siri voice commands through a dedicated button on the steering wheel.
* The car maker did not say when, and if for that matter, it plans on introducing wireless CarPlay support after Apple delivers this feature for public consumption via a forthcoming iOS software update.
* Here’s a table with Chevrolet infotainment systems for 2016 model year cars.

* Android Auto compatibility may be available on the eight-inch version of MyLink later in the 2016 model year because development and testing of Google’s automotive platform “is not yet complete,” according to General Motors’ own words.
* CarPlay-compatible models equipped with seven-inch MyLink screens will include 2016 models of the Spark, Cruze, Malibu, Camaro, Camaro Convertible, Silverado and Silverado HD.
* In addition, the following models will come outfitted with eight-inch screens: the Cruze, Malibu, Impala, Volt, Camaro, Camaro Convertible, Corvette, Corvette Convertible, Colorado, Silverado, Silverado HD, Tahoe and Suburban.
* These vehicles will be selling to customers around the world, including Brazil, Mexico and Canada.
* More than half-million owners of Chevrolet vehicles enjoy access to high-speed 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity across a range of cars, trucks and crossovers in the United States and Canada.
* It’s interesting that Chevrolet was the first car brand to introduce Siri Eyes Free functionality.
* Apple’s op-chief Jeff Williams earlier today winked at hints that Apple is working on Project Titan, its own electric vehicle.
* “The car is the ultimate mobile device,” he told journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher at Recode Conference. “We are exploring a lot of different markets,” he added.
