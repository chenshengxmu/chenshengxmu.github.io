* I can’t be the only one that thinks it’s weird that Apple’s still using those focus stealing low battery alerts, can I? I mean, doesn’t it seem like Apple would have preferred to use iOS 5’s new banner notifications instead?
* Well, apparently I’m not the only one who feels that way, because a new tweak has been released in Cydia named LowPowerBanner, and it does just that…
* After installation, your low power alerts will now appear via a much-less obtrusive banner alert instead of the focus stealing alerts of yesteryear.
* Interestingly enough, this exact same feature was requested on our latest episode of Ask Jeff:
* can you﻿ get banner notification insteed of popup alert on lowbattery warning and those kind of popup alerts?

* I’m not sure if this was a direct response to that inquiry, but congrats to jenyuan526, your request has been granted.
* LowPowerBanner features no app icons or settings to configure, just install it and it starts working. Obviously this tweak requires you to be on iOS 5 since it utilizes iOS 5’s banner notification feature.
* Do you think you’d prefer this manner of low power alert, or are you content with what we currently have?
