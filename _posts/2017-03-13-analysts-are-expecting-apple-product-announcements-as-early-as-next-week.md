* According to reputable supply chain analysts who spoke with MacRumors on condition of anonymity, Apple could announce some new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24.
* We already know that Apple will be previewing major updates to iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS at its annual developers conference, which this year kicks off with a keynote on June 5. We also know that the Cupertino company usually saves the best and most important product upgrades for September (iPhones, iPads, Macs and major iOS and macOS software upgrades). So, what could Apple be unveiling at a March press event?
* Well, if you ask KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo there will be a trio of new iPads this year: a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, a low cost 9.7-inch model and a new high-end iPad Pro model with a bezel-free display measuring between 10 and 10.5 inches diagonally and having the same resolution as Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
* All three iPads should use liquid crystal displays like prior models, but it’s unclear when they might arrive given that the original 12.9-inch iPad Pro launched in September 2015 while its 9.7-inch counterpart debuted in March of last year.
* A radically overhauled iPad with an AMOLED screen is expected in 2018.

* Japanese blog Mac Otakara recently learned from sources of its own that a March event should serve as a launchpad for a new 128-gigabyte model of iPhone SE, a range of Spring-themed Apple Watch bands, the previously rumored Red color option for the iPhone 7 series and refreshed iPad Pro models.
* If MacRumors’ sources are to be trusted and there’s a March product event on the horizon, Apple should be sending invites to select members of the press early this week.
* What particular Apple products would you prefer to see refreshed this spring?
* Tell us in comments.
