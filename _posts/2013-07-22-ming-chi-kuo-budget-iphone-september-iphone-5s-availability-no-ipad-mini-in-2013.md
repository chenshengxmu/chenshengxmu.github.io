* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is fast becoming the de facto most reliable Apple watcher. Expanding on his April note which advised investors to brace themselves for a delayed iDevice roll-out over manufacturing “challenges,” his just-updated shipments timetable now offers more in way of detail.
* Long story short, the analyst is expecting the iPhone 5S in late-September, but in limited quantity, with the oft-rumored plastic iPhone (he’s calling it an ‘iPhone Lite’) becoming available even sooner than the iPhone 5S in early-September because its chassis is easier to make than the two-tone iPhone 5S design.
* Early September will also bring us an updated iPad 5, he said, but there will be no iPad mini successor this year due to engineering issues. As for the Mac family, Kuo sees a mid-September launch of a Haswell-enabled Retina MacBook Pro, with a Haswell-driven iMac up for a late-August introduction. The full breakdown is right after the break…
* Check out the shipments timetable, part of a research note obtained by AppleInsider.

* The full breakdown follows:
* If Kuo’s timetable is anything to go by, there should be a major Apple media event in late-August or early-September to announce the next iPhone and iPad (the iMac refresh could be handled via a press release and a website update).
* So there you have it.
* Sounds pretty much spot on to me.
* What do you guys make of this?
