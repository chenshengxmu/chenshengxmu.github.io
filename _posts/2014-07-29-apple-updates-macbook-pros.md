* As expected, Apple has refreshed its family of MacBook Pro with Retina display laptops this morning. The updates add faster processors and more memory, and come just after the launch of the company’s annual back-to-school promotion.
* There are three new 13-inch models and two new 15-inch notebooks, all of which have received the latest versions of Intel’s i5 and i7 Haswell processors. In terms of additional memory, Apple has doubled the entry-level RAM for both lines…
* The base 13-inch model now comes with a 2.6 Intel Core i5 chip and 8GB of memory, instead of a 2.4GHz i5 chip and 4GB. And the base 15-inch now features 16GB, instead of 8GB, and the processor has been bumped from 2.0GHz to 2.2GHz.

* Unlike the price cuts seen with Apple’s latest MacBook Air refresh, prices for the Retina MacBook Pros still start at $1,299 for the 13-inch and $1,999 for 15-inch. The more expensive 15-inch model, however, has dropped from $2,599 to $2,499.
* Today’s refresh comes a few months ahead of the expected release for Mac OS X Yosemite, the next major version of Mac OS. The update is currently in beta, and is expected to be available to the public in October as a free download for Mac owners.
