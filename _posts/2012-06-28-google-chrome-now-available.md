* Well, that’s a headline that’s been a long time in the making. Google Chrome is now officially available on some App Stores — including the US App Store.
* You can download Google Chrome here.
* Google Chrome for iOS is a universal app for the iPhone and the iPad, and both versions cater to each device’s form factor. As a Chrome desktop user, the biggest highlight for me is the ability to sync bookmarks and tabs between all devices…
* Chrome on iOS makes this a snap, and that’s really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the amount of features it offers on both devices.
* Have you downloaded Chrome for iOS yet? If so, please share your experience below. We’ll be back later with a full hands-on with the highly anticipated browser as well.
