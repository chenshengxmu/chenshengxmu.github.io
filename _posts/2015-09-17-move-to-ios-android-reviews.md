* Apple’s new ‘Move to iOS’ app is now available on Android and a lot of fans of Google’s mobile platform have already posted hate-spewing reviews on the Play Store. The app lets people switch over from Android to iOS by wirelessly migrating their data, settings and personal information to an iPhone.
* The vast majority of reviews have nothing to do with the app itself and instead criticize Apple’s closed ecosystem and walled garden approach.
* In venting their frustration at Apple, angered Android fans are taking advantage of Play Store reviews to ridicule Apple, call its fans ‘iSheep’, criticize the iPhone’s battery life and diss the Apple Watch as an overpriced luxury device in an apparent absence of any real arguments.
* “Everything about iOS is designed to be easy. That includes switching to it,” reads the app’s description in the Play Store.
* “With just a few steps, you can migrate your content automatically and securely from your Android device with the Move to iOS app. No need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android.”
* “Do not install unless you want a lobotomy,” one user wrote.
* “Seriously? You think people to move to a restricted ecosystem that won’t even allow you to try apps before you buy?? Google why did you allow them to put this app here? Oh that’s right you promote innovation and don’t charge for it or place restrictions on it. Actually, I am surprised Apple isn’t charging $20 for the app.”
* Another comment reads:
* Apple’s first Android app? What a bloody disgrace! I call on my fellow Android comrades to ensure this app gets drowned into oblivion with a 1 star rating never to be seen again on our cherished platform.
* I’ve given it one star only because they won’t allow a similar app on the App-Store, to move to Android (or any other platform for that matter). The idea is OK, but the opposite cannot be done, and that’s not a fair competition and not thinking about the customers’ right to choose their own device.
* And Mr. Complete Sarcasm wrote:
* I downloaded this application with hopes of switching over to iOS from Android. I’ve burned all my pencils since the only worthy writing tool is the holy Apple Pencil.
* I’ve decided to sell one of my kidneys, because I need that gold Apple Watch. And now I gotta have the iPhone 6s, because 3d Touch just sounds like an intimate way to get to know my phone. Hope to throw my money at you soon!
* “Dear Apple, the reason I went from iOS to Android is because Google put all their apps on iOS to use,” another one wrote.
* “I became so invested in their ecosystem at that point that it just worked better to have an Android phone. Do the same thing (make the default apps for Android with an Apple ID login) and people might move back,” he continued.
* “I get that this is an Android to iPhone app, but you could have at least used a Material Design theme,” reads yet another comment.
* Another user jokingly remarked that his “micro USB would not fit,” although the app was designed for wireless data transfer.
* In addition to being blasted in comments, Move to iOS at the time of this writing garnered a 1.9-star rating based on more than 3,500 reviews.
* My colleague Jeff has put together a nice step-by-step tutorial on migrating your data and settings to an iPhone with Move to iOS.
