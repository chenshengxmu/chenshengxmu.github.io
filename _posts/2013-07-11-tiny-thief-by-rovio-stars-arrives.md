* True to its promise, Rovio’s third-party publishing arm Rovio Stars released Tiny Thief on the App Store, a medieval adventure game developed by Barcelona-based 5 Ants Studio. In Tiny Thief, you’re tasked with solving thirty stealth-based puzzles. The game includes five distinct chapters, over 85 hidden items and a host of colorful characters, including The Pastry Chef and Ferret (your most loyal companion). Go past the fold for a gameplay video and additional tidbits…
* Here’s a teaser clip.
* The blurb has it:
* In a world of greed, corruption and injustice, one little guy decides to stand up for the little guy!
* Say hello to Tiny Thief, an unconventional hero who uses cunning and trickery to out-smart his opponents across six epic medieval adventures.
* But beware! He faces fearsome foes, like the Dark Knight, rogue pirates and even a giant robot!
* The game strives to recreate the magic from the point-and-click games of old.

* The game supports Game Center leaderborads and achievements and lets you uncover hidden treasures and other surprises.
* Tiny Thief cots 99 cents a pop, which buys you a universal binary running natively on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices running iOS 5.0 or later.
* It also launched on Google’s Play store as Rovio Stars’ first release for Android devices (their first release, Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage, was an iOS exclusive).
