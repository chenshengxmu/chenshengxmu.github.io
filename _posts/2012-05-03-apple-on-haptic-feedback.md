title: Apple still working on haptic feedback for iOS devices

* Remember the last-minute rumor that Apple was going to integrate Senseg’s haptic feedback into its third-generation iPad? The theory, which surfaced just hours before Apple’s iPad event, never materialized. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.
* 9to5Mac points to a new patent application from the Cupertino company, discovered by PatentlyApple, regarding haptic feedback. The filing covers a technology that is described as a “wildly intelligent multi-tiered haptics system…”
* “today’s surprise invention packs a punch with a wildly intelligent multi-tiered haptics system. The system will actually allow an iDevice display to deform so that it could provide the user with a button, an arrow or even a geological map to physically pop right out of the screen to give it 3D depth. If that wasn’t cool enough, Apple’s patent discusses a flexible OLED display that could be used for video glasses.”
* Combine this with the number of other haptic-related filings we’ve seen over the years, and you have to assume that Apple is still very interested in the touch-feedback technology. And by the looks of things, it’s not the typical ‘vibrating’ sensation you see on other handsets.
* What do you think, do you want haptic feedback (however awesome) on your iOS devices? Or is it a lost cause?
