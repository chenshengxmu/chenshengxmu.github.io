* Apple yesterday published a pair of new videos through its official YouTube channel, covering the Moments feature in Photos which uses machine learning to automatically create themed albums and animated slideshows from your best images and videos.
* Running sixteen seconds long each, the two new clips show how to customize and share Memories in the stock Photos app on iPhone. Using iOS’s multipurpose Share sheet, users can publish their currently playing Memory Movie to Facebook, Twitter and other services.
* And with the ability to choose from many built-in templates and songs, everyone can customize every Memory to their liking, all from within the stock Photos app.
* “Customize your Memories movies by choosing from tons of preselected moods and music, right from the Photos app,” reads the video’s description.
* “Share your favorite Memories movies with friends, family or all of Facebook, right from the Photos app.”
