* We’ve all been part of a group conversation involving multiple people actively messaging each other, making our phones buzz every few minutes with every new message. Depending on the situation, it can be incredibly fun and entertaining, or quite disturbing, especially if you’re trying to ficus on a specific task.
* Thankfully, there is Do Not Disturb, a handy feature that temporarily silences all notifications on your iPhone and iPad. When enabled, messages and the likes still reach your iPhone, but the device won’t ring or vibrate to let you know you have a new message.
* The downside of Do Not Disturb is that it silences all notifications on your device, without leaving you any room for customization. But a feature that was recently introduced lets you set specific iMessage or SMS conversations on Do Not Disturb. You will still receive these messages, but you won’t be alerted about them.
* In this post, I will show you how to put individual or group conversations on Do Not Disturb within the Messages app, giving you a little peace and quiet from those annoying people who don’t seem to have anything to do but messaging you all day.
* 1) Identify the conversation you want to put on Do Not Disturb.
* 2) Swipe from right to left on the conversation.

* 3) Tap on Hide Alerts.
* A small moon-like icon will appear next to the person’s name to indicate this conversation is now on Do Not Disturb.

* To get notifications for this conversation again, simply swipe right to left again, then select Show Alerts.
* Once again, it must be noted that while your iPhone won’t ring, vibrate or even light up when you receive a message from this person, you will still be receiving messages. Depending on your setup, these messages will likely be visible on your Lock screen. A red badge will also show on your Messages app icon indicating unread items.
