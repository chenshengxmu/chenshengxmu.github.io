title: FullScreen for Safari Adds Multitouch Functionality to Your iPhone Browsing Experience
---
* Even with plenty of browser alternatives out there, I always find myself going back to Safari.  There’s just something aesthetically pleasing about Apple’s stock browser that keeps me coming back, even though it’s totally devoid of some basic features.
* For this reason, whenever I hear about any tweaks that add additional functionality to Safari, I’m all over it like white on rice.  The latest tweak to come out of the jailbreak community is called FullScreen for Safari, and it packs quite the punch.

* If you’re a Mac user, or at all familiar with multi-touch gestures offered by the MacBook, Magic Mouse, or Magic Trackpad, you’ll be sailing amongst familiar seas when utilizing this handy little tweak.  There’s a healthy amount of user assignable actions to the various multi-touch gestures, and those can be customized by means of the Settings.app.
* Installing this tweak means that you can assign a double swipe to open a new tab, go forward, reload, etc.  Again if you’re familiar at all with multi-touch on a Mac, you’ll feel right at home with FullScreen for Safari.
* Of course the name of the tweak itself indicates that its main purpose is to allow you to toggle in and out of fullscreen mode using the Safari browser.  Just like the other actions, fullscreen mode can be assigned to a few different commands, and can even be invoked by means of the accelerometer (shaking the device).
* What makes this tweak  so nice, is how clean the interface is. When you’re in fullsreen mode, you truly are in full screen mode.  There’s no ugly UI littering the screen as with similar apps that offer the same functionality, and browsing can be done competently in full screen mode thanks to the multi-touch gestures.
* All in all, I consider FullScreen for Safari $1.49 well spent.  If you’re on a jailbroken phone, and you don’t like some of the alternative browsers offered in the App Store, head over to Cydia, and try it out.
