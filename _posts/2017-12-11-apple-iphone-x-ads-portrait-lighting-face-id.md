* Apple just published three new iPhone X-focused videos on its official YouTube channel that promote iPhone X’s Portrait Lighting shooting mode and the Face ID biometric feature.
* The videos show off Portrait Lighting mode in action while underscoring Face ID’s underlying machine learning tech that helps the handset adapt to the user’s face as it changes over time.
* Here they are.
* Song: “Nana” by Polo & Pan
* “iPhone X recognizes you, even when you change.”
* Song: “Ready” by Hael
* “Face ID on iPhone X introduces the most unforgettable magical password ever created: Your face.”
* Song: “Messy Love” by Mura Masa
