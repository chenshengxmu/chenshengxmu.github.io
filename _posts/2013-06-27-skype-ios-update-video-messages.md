* Microsoft-owned Skype was testing a new Video Messages feature since mid-February, but it wasn’t until mid-June that they opened video messaging to everyone.
* Today, the software maker has finally updated Skype for iPhone and iPad with free and unlimited Video Messages, basically short videos Skype users can send to each other, even when offline.
* Previously, you could only send 20 free messages up to three-minute long each before being prompted to sign up for a $4.99 premium Skype account…
* Other changes in the new Skype version 4.9 apps include audio and video call stability improvements, more reliable photo sharing, improved accessibility for video messaging and general fixes and improvements.
* I sincerely hope they’re serious about “audio and video call stability improvements” because Skype calls lately are prone to quality issues, often dropping mid-call. It’s almost as if Microsoft is randomly hanging up Skype calls to push us gently toward paid tiers.

* Here’s a nice Skype Video Messages promo.
* Skype for iPhone iPhone and iPad iPad can be downloaded free from the App Store. You can also grab a free Skype update for Android or BlackBerry devices, in addition to Skype for Windows desktop and Windows 8 devices
* Speaking of which, isn’t it high time Microsoft merged the two builds into a single universal binary?
