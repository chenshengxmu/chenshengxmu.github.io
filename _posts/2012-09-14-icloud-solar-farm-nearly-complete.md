* Interesting new aerial shots of Apple’s $1 billion iCloud data center in Maiden, North Carolina show that the company’s 100-acre solar farm is nearly complete. Filed as the nation’s largest end-user owned solar energy farm (take that, Greenpeace!), it will provide 20 megawatts of power when completed.
* Thanks to these new aerial shots, we can now tell just how massive the facility is going to be. Compared to images take from an airplane on August 2, these new photos indicate that the solar farm is getting close to being completed…
* These images were provided to GigaOM by the WCNC-TV crew.

* This is what it looked when Wired snapped it from above in August.

* Quite a difference, no?
