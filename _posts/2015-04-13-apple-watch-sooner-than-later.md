* Good news today for those hoping that their Apple Watches will arrive before their estimated ship dates. MacRumors reports that a reader, who emailed Tim Cook over the weekend regarding the lengthy lead times for the wearable, received a response from the executive team saying that preorders will most likely ship sooner than expected.
* “[Apple] said that June preorders will most likely ship sooner than June,” said reader Andrew Turko, after speaking with someone on Apple’s executive relations team. “Of course he didn’t make any promises, but that’s the reason Apple is announcing such an extended ship date after all – to avoid disappointment through false guarantees.”
* It’s believed that Apple sold over 1 million Apple Watches in just the US on Friday. Pre-orders went live at 12:01am Pacific that morning, and within minutes, shipping estimates for more popular Watch models slipped from April 24th to mid-May or June. As of today, all models have at least June shipping dates, and many say July or August.
* Additionally, Apple has also said there will not be any Watches available for in-store purchase on April 24, in hopes to put an end to long lines and improve the launch day experience. But Turko says he was told that, fearing lines will happen anyway, discussion surrounding in-store stock and launch day marketing are being considered with “great concern.”
