* If you would have asked the world 40 years ago what 2012 would be like, a lot of folks would have probably said that we’d be driving vehicles that didn’t touch the ground and there’d be tons of robots.
* While flying-cars still appear to be a long ways away from materializing, the latter prediction may not be too far off. Apple’s go to parts manufacturing firm Foxconn is reportedly about to add 1 million robots to the population…
* 9to5Mac is reporting that the component-making company is planning to replace an unspecified amount of workers with one million robots over the next 3 years. Foxconn is not only responsible for building Apple products, but also works with Sony, Nokia, and many others.
* The mechanical replacements will be used for basic tasks like spraying, welding, and assembling components. They’re expected to help the manufacturer keep up with the rising demands of their high-profile clients. You know, because robots don’t need lunch breaks or sleep.
* Foxconn has been in and out of the headlines for the past few years thanks to a string of worker-suicides and countless reports of poor working conditions. I wonder if they’ll make the new robots sign a “no suicide” waver too.
* All jokes aside, the move to a robotic workforce does spell out trouble for Chinese citizens. Foxconn currently employs 1.2 million workers, so bringing on a million robots would assumedly lead to massive layoffs.
* What do you think of a company deploying a million robots? Scary?
