* The prolific 3D designer Martin Hajek has envisioned a number of interesting Apple concepts, some more successful than the others. A few examples of his more recent work include the iPad mini 2 in gold and blue, the iWatch running Apple Maps and other iWatch renders.
* Taking inspiration from a unique red Mac Pro designed by Jony Ive to be auctioned off for charity, Hajek has now produced a set of nice renditions attempting to imagine what Apple’s upcoming pro desktop might look like in gold finish…
* “Jony Ive can do a red Mac Pro,” Hajek remarks on his blog. “But when I first showed this gold Mac Pro rendering to my girlfriend her first reaction was: I want it.”

* I’m not Hajek’s girlfriend, but I’d kill for one, too!
* Another one.

* And here’s one depicting the Mac Pro, the iPhone 5s, Apple’s Magic Mouse and aluminum keyboard – all in gold.

* bling bling computing indeed.
* You can find a couple more renders on Hajek’s blog right here.
* Apple’s gone to great lengths to produce the Mac Pro’s ‘Made in USA’ enclosure. As revealed in its ‘how it’s made’ video, the company is employing the sophisticated deep drawing process on an astonishing scale and is using techniques typically reserved for the aerospace or medical device industries.

* Apple has promised to ship the Mac Pro “in December” in two configurations.
* The basic $2,999 model comes with Intel’s 3.7GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 processor, 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory, dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage.

* The more powerful $3,999 configuration includes a 3.5GHz six-core Intel Xeon E5 processor, 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage.
* As per usual, customers will be able to configure the pro desktop to their liking through the online Apple Store. It’s my new dream desktop and my only regret is not being able to afford it – at least not without breaking the bank.
