* Fans of the popular MobileTerminal utility for jailbroken iOS devices will be happy to hear that the frustration is finally over. After a several-month absence, an iOS 5-compatible version of the tool is now available in Cydia.
* This means that you can forget about going through the tedious 5 step process of manually installing the app’s .deb file every time you want to get MobileTerminal on your device. The package is now just a tap away…
* MobileTerminal, which is a bite-sized emulator of the Terminal utility in Mac OS, has a number of uses. You can use it to set file permissions and change passwords on your iOS device, or to SSH into remote systems.
* So if you’ve been waiting for the updated app to hit Cydia, or this is the first time you’ve heard about it and want to check it out, you can find MobileTerminal 520-2 in the BigBoss repo. And don’t worry, it’s still free.
* Have you grabbed MobileTerminal yet?
