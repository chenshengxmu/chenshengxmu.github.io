* We recently told you about Apple’s free shipping holiday promotion for its online store. Any order placed through December 22nd will be shipped for free, including orders that are under $50.
* Apple has added another perk to its promotion by offering 2-3 business day delivery for free. This means that online orders will be shipped much faster throughout the holidays.

* Standard shipping can take up to 5 days, and with Christmas less than two weeks away, it’s getting too late for last-minute gift orders. While Apple’s free shipping deadline has not changed, customers can receive their orders much faster through next Thursday.
* As MacRumors notes, you need to place your orders by December 19th if you want them to arrive before Christmas. Certain products have their own free shipping deadlines, as built-to-order Macs are not included as of tomorrow. The window for free shipping on the iPhone 4S has already passed (shipping is now 1-2 weeks), but that’s to be expected considering the high demand.
* Apple’s holiday shipping page has all of the deadline information and other details.
* You can always pay next-day shipping if you really need to get that iPod touch soon, but we would recommend actually visiting a retail location if you’re that desperate.
