* Ipsum is a jailbreak tweak that makes it ridiculously simple to clear iOS 5’s Lock screen notifications.
* A single swipe of the notification will work as normal — unlock the phone and go to the app that created the notification. With Ipsum installed, all it takes is a double swipe of the Lock screen notification to get rid of it…
* Ipsum may seem trivial, but it’s one of the best methods to clear iOS 5 Lock screen notifications that we’ve seen from the jailbreak community thus far.
* Head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo if you’re interested in trying it out. Don’t forget to let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
