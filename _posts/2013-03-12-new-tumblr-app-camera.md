* Users of the popular blogging site Tumblr will be happy to hear that a fairly significant update for the iOS app has just posted. The update includes an all new camera interface and a handful of new features.
* Perhaps the most notable addition is the ability to create Photosets from within the app. Tumblr released a standalone app for Photosets last fall, and it’s finally decided to roll the feature into its official client…
* For those unfamiliar with the service, Photosets are actually pretty cool. They allow you to create a collection of photos, with your own customized layout. And then you can share them with friends and family.
* Here’s the full change log for today’s update:
* -Brand new camera!  -Create photosets straight from the app.  -Double-tap posts to like!  -Tap the avatar in your profile to change it.  -Link posts: Copy or enter a URL and we’ll fetch the title!
* The new camera is also worth checking out. Tumblr has done a great job outfitting it with different features while still keeping it simple. You can adjust the flash, add a grid overlay, and swipe up to access galleries.
* Needless to say, even if you’re an infrequent Tumblr user, you’ll want to grab this update. And if you don’t already have the app, it’s available in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free. Check it out.
