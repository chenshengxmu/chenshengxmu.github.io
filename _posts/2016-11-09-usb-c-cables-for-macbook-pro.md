* There’s a lot to love about Apple’s new MacBook Pros. They’re sleeker, smaller, have a larger trackpad and better speakers, and feature all-new USB-C ports. Unfortunately, these new ports also mean you’re probably going to need to purchase some new cables.
* Want to plug in your iPhone? You’ll need a new cable. Connect your MacBook Pro to a non-Thunderbolt display? Yep, cable. You get the idea. So with this in mind, we decided to put together a list of some of the common cables you’re probably going to need.

* Once you move to a USB-C MacBook, chances are other USB-C devices will follow. For this reason, it can’t hurt to grab an extra (or a few extra) USB-C charging and sync cables. We like these 6.6ft cables from RAVPower because they have anodized aluminum casing for better heat dispersion, durability, and general brand track record.
* Buy for $13.

* Among the many things Apple got rid of in the new MacBook Pro is the MagSafe charger. Folks that really think they’re going to miss the MagSafe may want to check out the BreakSafe from Griffin. It’s essentially the same idea. You plug a USB-C dongle into your laptop, and it magnetically connects with the power cable.
* Buy for $40.

* Want to plug your old external hard drive or any other standard USB accessory into your new MacBook Pro? Chances are you’re going to need one of these USB-C to USB 3.0 cables. Transfers data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps, and also works vice versa connecting USB-C devices to standard USB 3.0 ports.
* Buy for $10.

* This cable is going to allow you to connect your micro USB devices to your new MacBook and vice versa. This includes things like battery packs and smartphones, and the cable supports both charging and data transfers with rates up to 480 Mbps. It also has a braided cloth jacket design for added durability and comes with a lifetime warranty and product support.
* Buy for $7.

* Cable Matters also makes a well-received USB-C to mini USB cable. Mini USB is the older, thicker version of micro USB, but is still used by a lot of devices for charging and syncing. I know my Yeti microphone has a mini USB connector, as do my old PS3 controllers. Like the above cable, this one comes with a lifetime warranty and support.
* Buy for $7.

* This USB-C to HDMI cable connects your USB-C device, like your new MacBook, to any HDMI display. It supports streaming 4K content and also delivers audio via the HDMI 1.4 interface. The cable has a 4.5 star rating on Amazon and comes with an 18-month warranty with customer service and support.
* Buy for $25.

* This one probably doesn’t need much explanation. If you want to plug in your iPhone to your new MacBook Pro, you’re going to need one of these cables. Can also be used to fast-charge the iPad Pro. Note that this cable is made by Apple, shipped from and sold by Amazon, and shipping is free for Prime members.
* Buy for $23.
