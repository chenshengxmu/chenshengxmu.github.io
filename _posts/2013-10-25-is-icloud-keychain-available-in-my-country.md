* With Tuesday’s free release of OS X Mavericks, Apple users can now opt to have their Safari web passwords securely synchronized across their iOS devices and Macs through the power of iCloud. The useful feature dubbed iCloud Keychain made a brief appearance in iOS 7 betas before being pulled from iOS 7 Gold Master, only to re-surface in iOS 7.0.3. What you probably don’t know is that iCloud Keychain isn’t necessarily supported everywhere so Apple’s published a handy list detailing iCloud Keychain availability by country…
