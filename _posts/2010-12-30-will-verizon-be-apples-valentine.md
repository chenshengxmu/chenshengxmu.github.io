* You gotta love all these Verizon iPhone rumors as it seems that every week, there is a new one being spread. The latest to date is a lovely rumor spread by Business Week, who got word from a “person familiar with Apple’s plans who is not authorized to discuss them publicly” that Apple will be holding a special event on Valentine’s Day to announce the new partnership with Verizon.
* It seems we’ve heard that before, no? Oh yeah right, we’ve heard that about a zillion times and it never actually happened…
* I think we all should spread our own rumors. We started to a few months ago when we announced that Apple was about to launch the iPhone 5G on Virgin Mobile.
* Go wild in the comments section and show us how creative you can be at launching a rumor.
