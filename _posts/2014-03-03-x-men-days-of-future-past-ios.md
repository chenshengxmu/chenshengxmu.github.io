* X-Men fans will be happy to hear that Marvel has announced that a mobile tie-in game for its upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past film is in the works. The publisher announced today that it has teamed up with studio Glitchsoft to create ‘Uncanny X-Men: Days of Future Past.’
* In a blog post this afternoon, Glitchsoft wrote that the game will give X-Men enthusiasts the chance to engage Marvel’s 1981 landmark Days of Future Past comic book story arc in an immersive and story-driven game ‘unlike anything available on mobile.’ Read on for more details…
* Here’s the full blog post:
* “Glitchsoft, acclaimed developer and publisher of premium action mobile games, today announced a mobile game licensing agreement with the one of the world’s most prominent character-based entertainment companies, Marvel Entertainment.
* “Glitchsoft came to us with a pedigree of rock-solid game development, strong production values, and a passion for the Uncanny X-Men franchise that was impossible to ignore,”said TQ Jefferson, VP of Games Production at Marvel. “It’s these sorts of qualities that we look for in a partner, and we couldn’t be more excited to bring our version of ‘Days of Future Past’ to mobile.”
* For the first time, Uncanny X-Men enthusiasts will be able to engage Marvel’s 1981 landmark “Days of Future Past” comic book story arc in an immersive and story-driven game unlike anything available on mobile. Leveraging the Helios Game Engine, Glitchsoft’s proprietary game development technology, Uncanny X-Men will be rendered in a unique side-scrolling 2D format. Uncanny X-Men is designed for mid-core gamers and will deliver a fast-paced, rewarding, and combat-focused experience.
* “Marvel has created some of the most revered characters of all time,” said Wes Tam, founder and VP creative of Glitchsoft. “We are excited to work with Marvel to bring the Uncanny X-Men characters to mobile gaming. Being lifelong fans, it is an incredible opportunity and even larger responsibility to create a game that honors the property. Our goal is to deliver a mobile game that core fans will truly embrace.”
* I for one am excited to see Marvel go a different route this time around, rather than pairing with Gameloft to create the usual hack-and-slash tie-in title. Glitchsoft uses its patented Helios Platform, which allows for a unique look and feel not available from other game engines.
* Not many other details are know about Uncanny X-Men: Days of Future Past, other than that it is slated to debut in May of this year. IMDb says that the movie is expected to launch on May 23, so we imagine the game will land around that time or perhaps a week beforehand.
