* Several new hi-res photos, and a video, surfaced this morning of what is said to be an actual rear shell of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. The part looks similar to previous leaks, with a cutout Apple logo and thick antenna breaks at the top and bottom.

* Feld & Volk adds that Apple has recently begun working with the same sapphire suppliers it has used for years in its modifications. It also speculates that the cutout Apple logo may be used for an NFC antenna, but the jury is still out on that.

* Leaked iPhone 6 parts have been popping up more frequently in recently weeks, as Apple presumably begins to ramp up production. The consensus is that the company plans to unveil the new handset at a media event sometime in September.
