title: ActiveDock now available on Cydia
---
* ActiveDock — a tweak inspired by the dock featured in OS X — is now available on Cydia for download. Last week, we took an in-depth look at ActiveDock, and determined that it is hands-down better looking than the stock dock in iOS. There are also features for alerting you when an app is launched and when an app receives a notification.
* Take a look at our video walkthrough for more information. In the meantime, if you’re browsing this post on your jailbroken iOS device, hit up this link to be taken directly to ActiveDock’s Cydia page. You can find it on the BigBoss repo for $1.99. Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments section.
