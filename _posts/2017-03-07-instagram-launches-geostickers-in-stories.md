* Instagram has aped Snapchat all over again, this time by launching geostickers which I’m sure you know are location-based stickers originally popularized by Snapchat. This cool feature is live in just two cities, for now, but you can bet they’ll be aggressively rolling it out in additional markets as rapidly as humanly possible. If you happen to live in Jakarta or New York City, use geofilters to spice up your Instagram Stories with visual accessories representing your present location, down to the neighborhood.
* Similar to other stickers (or widgets, as some people call them) that adorn your Stories with graphics like the current date/time or temperature in your location, the more than a dozen new geostickers each for New York City and Jakarta serve as location tags.
* Instagram explains:
* When you take a photo or video and tap the sticker icon, you’ll see geostickers at the top. No matter where you are in New York City or Jakarta, you’ll see a custom sticker for that city. You may see other stickers appear when you’re visiting select neighborhoods and landmarks — each one is designed to match the vibe of the location it represents.
* You can add as many geostickers as you want, adjust their size and placement and mix and match with other creative tools. Tapping on a geosticker takes you to Instagram’s standard location page where you can see additional photos in that particular area.

* Privacy-minded users needn’t worry—your Story won’t show up on the location page itself. The company notes that this is just an early version of geostickers so expect additional features and locations to be added over time.
* Instagram debuted stickers in Stories last December, ranging from hats to Valentine’s Day fun to customizable location stickers.
* As mentioned, geostickers are currently supported on photos taken in New York City or Jakarta and require the latest edition of Instagram’s mobile app, version 10.11.
* You can download Instagram for iOS free of charge from App Store.
