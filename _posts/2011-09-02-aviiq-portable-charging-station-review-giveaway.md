* Does your desk resemble a bird’s nest due to the mess of wires? If so, you might want to look into fixing that.
* Fortunately, AViiQ is making the fix an easy one. Introducing the AViiQ Portable Charging Station: a portable cable management solution for your iOS devices.
* For those of you with a few unwieldy USB cables littering your desk, this could be the solution that leads you back to organization. Check inside for the full video walkthrough & giveaway…
* Overall, I was satisfied with the AViiQ Portable Charging Station. It works pretty much as advertised, and it’s easy to pack everything away courtesy of the zipper case it comes bundled with.
* If there’s one main caveat to this case, it’s the price. At $79.99 it might be good for your cables, but it’s certainly not going to do your pockets any favors.
* Thankfully, price won’t be an issue for one fortunate viewer, because we’re giving one away. All you need to do is like us on Facebook for a chance to win. Shout out to AViiQ for providing this review sample!
* How do you think you’d benefit from such a cable management system? Let me know what you think in the comments below.
