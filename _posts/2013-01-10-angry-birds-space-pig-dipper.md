title: 'Pig Dipper' update adds 30 new aquatic levels to Angry Birds Space
---
* Rejoice, Angry Birds fans. Just like clockwork, Rovio has updated its Angry Birds Space game with an ambiguously titled Pig Dipper episode bringing thirty new galactic-aquatic levels to your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Android devices. This episode introduces a new planet called Splash that features pigs in boats – how bizarre is that?.
* Also look for strange aquatic extraterrestrial life and water-based physics allowing for some nice trick shots. The game adds power-up specific leaderboards and amuses with the stuff like inflating the pigs with Pig Puffer and creating black holes with Space Egg, to name a few. I wonder if the giant fish is the boss…

* SPLASH! The Angry Birds have landed in the weirdest galaxy yet! All the planets are filled with water, strange aquatic life and worst of all — Bad Piggies in boats! Use the unique physics of these water planets to set up some fun trick shots! Also, check out the brand-new power-ups: Flock of Birds, Space Egg, and Pig Puffer! HINT: Make sure to check how Ice Bird and Pig Puffer react to water!
* The water-based physics provides for some fun trick shots to send the birds careening through water. This content update is free to those who’ve purchased the game. With this update, Angry Birds Space contains a cool 150 gravity-defying levels.
* Angry Birds Space costs 99 cents for the iPhone and iPod touch version and three bucks for the high-definition iPad build. The Mac version, however, doesn’t come cheap and will run you five bucks.
* Quickly, do the math in your head – it’s nine bucks to play the game on all of your screens.
