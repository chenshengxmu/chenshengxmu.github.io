* Remember when Skype finally enabled video calling for the iPhone late last year? The iPhone 4 debuted with FaceTime in the summer and it was nearly 6 months before we saw Skype add video calling to its iOS application.
* Fast forward to March of this year, and Apple launched the iPad 2 with a front facing camera and FaceTime support. Since then, everyone has wondered if Skype would port its video calling application to the popular tablet.
* Well, we are about at the 6 month mark since Apple released its second tablet, and it just so happens that a mysterious Skype promo video is making its way around the internet…
* RazorianFly posted this video earlier this morning showing off what seems to be an official Skype application for the iPad. The blog claims that Skype uploaded this promotional clip to their YouTube channel earlier this morning, but the video has since been set to private.
* The video is actually a screen recording of the video, captured and uploaded by a RazorianFly reader before it was pulled.
* While we can’t be 100% sure of its authenticity, it certainly wouldn’t surprise anyone to see Skype’s video calling application make its way to the iPad in the not-too-distant future.
* What do you think? Real, fake, or who cares I use FaceTime anyways?
