* Let’s get started.
* Without further ado, here are the best keyboard shortcuts in Safari.
* To quickly switch between tabs using your keyboard, use Control (⌃)-Tab (⇥)  or Control (⌃)-Shift (⇧)-Tab (⇥) to navigate your open tabs forward and backwards. You can also press Command (⌘)-1 to Command (⌘)-8 to quickly switch to a specific tab. If your open tabs don’t fit Safari’s tab bar, simply swipe left or right on any tab using your trackpad to reveal the ones outside window boundaries.
* To instantly jump to the rightmost open tab, press Command (⌘)-9. This handy shortcut only works on Mac computers running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 or newer. On older macOS editions, this shortcut takes you to the ninth tab.
* You can quickly close a tab by pressing Command (⌘)-W. To close all tabs except the currently active one, right-click or Control (⌃)-click the one you’d like to keep and choose Close Other Tabs from a popup menu. Alternatively, Option (⌥)-click the tab’s close symbol (“x”).
* Have you ever closed a tab and instantly regretted doing so? No big deal, there are several shortcuts for bringing recently closed tabs. If your last action in Safari was closing a tab,  use the standard undo shortcut Command (⌘)-Z. Otherwise, press Shift(⇧)-Command(⌘)-T or choose Reopen Last Closed Tab from Safari’s History menu.
* You can use this shortcut (or the Undo action) repeatedly to reopen multiple closed tabs. To reopen a particular closed tab, select it from Safari’s History → Recently Closed sub-menu
* TIP: To reopen any accidentally closed windows or tabs from your last browsing session, click Safari’s History menu and choose the option Reopen All Windows From Last Session.
* We know how to switch between tabs, but how do you quickly switch between windows? Just press Command (⌘)-` or Command (⌘)-Shift (⇧)-` to switch windows in reverse.
* Let the trackpad and mouse rest. Use the Command (⌘)-] shortcut to advance to the next webpage and Command (⌘)-[ to go back to the previous webpage.
* To scroll a full page at a time, hold the Option (⌥) key and press the Up or Down arrow key. You can also press the Space bar or the Space+Shift (⇧) combination to scroll down or up a full page.
* To instantly reach the very top or bottom of a webpage, hold the Command (⌘) key on the keyboard while pressing the Up or Down arrow key.
* Every little bit of real estate counts. To show or hide your Favorites bar, press Command (⌘)-Shift (⇧)-B.
* To quickly open a new private-browsing session, press Command (⌘)-Shift (⇧)-N.
* Want fast access to Bookmarks, Reading List and Shared links? Try pressing Command (⌘)-Shift(⇧)-L.
* If you want to quickly access the address bar to type in a URL or enter a search query, use Command (⌘)-L.
* Of course, there are many more productivity-boosting keyboard shortcuts for Safari that you should familiarize yourself with, but these twelve basic ones should be incorporated into everyone’s repertoire from the get-go.
