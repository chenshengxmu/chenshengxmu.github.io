title: How to Create Text Shortcuts in iOS 5

* One of my all-time favorite jailbreak tweaks is Xpandr, a simple tool that lets you create a library of shortcuts for snippets of text that you use frequently, such as addresses, URLs, and standard replies.
* There is no jailbreak for iOS 5 yet, which means no Xpandr for me. Fortunately, Apple has implemented this very same feature in iOS 5. This is how it works…
* Instead of typing the same text snippets over and over again – such as an email signature, for example – iOS lets you create a shortcut, which, when typed on your keyboard, will add the phrase associated with this shortcut.
* As you can see on the image above, instead of typing the full iDB URL, I just use the simple shortcut “idburl.” When I type this on my iPhone, it automatically turns into http://www.idownloadblog.com/.
* Repeat this process with countless other phrases and you have a great time saver.
* Adding shortcuts is as simple as you would expect:
* Now every time you type the shortcut anywhere in iOS 5, it will display the full phrase.
* Handy, isn’t it?
