* DockAlpha is a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to adjust the dock alpha settings on iOS 9. The tweak, which is available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, lends a more transparent look to the dock for jailbroken iOS 9 users. If you’re looking to subtly change the look of the iOS Home screen, you may want to give DockAlpha a try.

* Sliding the slider to the left decreases the opacity, and sliding to the right increases the opacity. The default dock setting is the 1 setting, which is all the way to the right.
* Again, DockAlpha is available for free on the BigBoss repo. You can hear us discuss it on the latest episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak, which is available now if you’re subscribed to the podcast.
