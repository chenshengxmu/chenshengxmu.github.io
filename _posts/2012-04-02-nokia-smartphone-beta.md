* AT&T is saying its high-profile launch of the Nokia Lumia 900 in the United States will dwarf the iPhone. We’ll see about that, but if a new Smartphone Betatest website is anything to go by, the Finnish cell phone giant isn’t afraid at all to take pot shots at the carrier’s ‘hero’ device.
* Specifically, Nokia-posted videos on the site allude to the iPhone 4’s perceived weaknesses, including the infamous cellular reception issue that culminated under the controversial Antennagate headline in 2010.
* A trio of clips on the Smartphone Betatest site specifically target Apple’s phone. Even though the handset is blurred out, it’s pretty clear the creative concept targets the iPhone.
* The videos depict a marketing department meeting, with the participants ridiculing the widely reported antenna issue with the iPhone 4 and its apparently fragile glass and metal design.
* See the clips for yourself right below.
* As you know, both Nokia and the ailing BlackBerry maker Research In Motion are currently involved in a public brawl with the iPhone maker over the emerging Nano SIM card standard.
* Windows Phone is considered a legitimate iPhone contender, but the platform lacks market traction and apps. Microsoft is reportedly pouring in significant resources in an effort to convince developers to port popular apps to Windows Phone devices.
* Sixteen months later, Windows Phone has more than 70,000 apps.
* The latest example is a version of the popular Plex media player app that just launched on the Windows Phone platform. Microsoft is also paying carriers millions in marketing expenses just to carry Windows Phone devices.
* According to AT&T, which will exclusively carry the Lumia 900 in the United States, that handset launch will overshadow even the iPhone.
* AT&T and Nokia are readying a massive television marketing campaign to raise consumer awareness. The Lumia 900 will be the centerpiece at AT&T stores, with massive signs and posters promoting the device. Nokia and AT&T spent considerable time training store reps, and a majority of them will be carrying one with them at all times.
* The rumor-mill has Apple launching a sixth-generation iPhone either at WWDC, which apparently runs between June 11-15, or this Fall.
* According to iOS 5.1 code strings recently discovered by iDownloadBlog, the device should support 4G LTE networking and possibly FaceTime video calling over 4G.
* So, about those anti-Apple Nokia clips – funny or what?
