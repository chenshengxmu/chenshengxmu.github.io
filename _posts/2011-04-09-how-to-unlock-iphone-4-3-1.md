* The Dev Team just released their unlock for iPhone 4.3.1. This updated version of ultrasn0w brings support for the iPhone 3Gs and the iPhone 4 that are exclusively using these basebands: 01.59.00, 04.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, and 06.15.00.
* In this post, we’ll guide you into unlocking your iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 on any of the above basebands, and running the latest iOS 4.3.1…
* First, you have to make sure your iPhone comes with any of the baseband versions listed above. If it doesn’t there isn’t much solution for you at this time.
* If your iPhone is however running any of those versions, you can easily update to iOS 4.3.1 while preserving your baseband, which will allow you to unlock using ultrasn0w 1.2.1.
* Step 1: You will first have to jailbreak and update your iPhone using one of these methods:
* Step 2: Once you are updated to iOS 4.3.1, launch Cydia, go to Manage > Sources > Edit > Add,  and type in the following repo: http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com. This will install the ultrasn0w unlock on your phone.
* Step 3: After installing UltraSn0w, make sure to reboot your iPhone.
* At this point, you can insert a different SIM card. If you install T-Mobile, make sure to disable 3G in Settings > General > Network.
* Thats all there is to it. The whole jailbreak+unlock process is fairly easy and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
* Let us know if you have any question.
