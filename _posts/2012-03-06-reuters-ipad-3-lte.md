* Apple is expected to unveil its iPad 3 tomorrow. Finally, we’ll get to see the tablet that the company has been working on for the past year. And perhaps best of all, we’ll finally get to put these silly iPad 3 rumors to rest.
* But for now, they’re still fair game. And the latest report comes from Reuters. The publication is throwing its hat in with a list of other credible sources in claims that Apple’s new tablet will feature 4G LTE technology…
* “The newest iPad will be capable of operating on a high speed 4G “LTE,” or Long-Term Evolution network, according to a source familiar with the product. At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology, that may go a long way toward banishing the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices.”
* LTE has been a pretty controversial feature amongst speculation regarding the iPad 3. While some folks have been confident the tablet will feature the 4G technology, others don’t believe the tech is widespread enough for Apple to take on the extra costs and headaches.
* But more recent reports from Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, and now Reuters, seem to all but confirm the feature. And at this point, it wouldn’t surprise us a bit if Apple unveiled an LTE-compatible tablet at tomorrow’s event.
* What do you think? Would you buy an LTE iPad?
