* This is the app’s inaugural public beta so expect some rough edges and bugs.
* “We will have deep integration with our other apps (check out the persona buttons!),” reads the post, adding they’ll be pushing an update to Photo and Designer before this works.
* You can download the public beta of Affinity Publisher via the official website.
* If you’re going to be taking this app for a spin, it may be a good idea to watch a selection of tutorials that are available on the Affinity website to help you get started with Publisher.
* Affinity Publisher is months away from commercial launch, according to the website.
* Here’s what you’ll need to test drive the app on your Mac or Windows desktop.
* Serif, a privately-owned British software developer and publisher, is behind other Affinity-branded apps like Affinity Photo, their excellent Photoshop and Pixlemator alternative.

* There’s also the pro vector drawing app Affinity Designer that recently got ported to iPad with Apple Pencil support and a bunch of pro-grade features. Last but not least, last year saw the arrival of Affinity Photo for the iPad, another great Serif app for creatives.
