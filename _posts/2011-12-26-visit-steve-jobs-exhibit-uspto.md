* A couple of days ago, I took the opportunity to visit Alexandria, Virginia, home of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. I visited there with the intention of getting a glimpse of the Steve Jobs patent exhibit before it was scheduled to be removed in a few weeks.
* It’s pretty interesting to look at some of the history of Apple’s patents and the people involved with those patents. The exhibit was uniquely designed to showcase 12 patents per iPhone screen; I guess you could say the patents were the “app icons” of each of the many large-scaled iPhone’s that made up the exhibit.
* If you won’t be able to make it to the exhibit before it gets taken down, don’t fret; I’ve captured my visit on video for you to enjoy…
* All in all, it was a great visit. I wouldn’t say that it’s a standalone reason to travel to Alexandria, but seeing as its close to DC, it’s worth a visit if you happen to be in the area.
