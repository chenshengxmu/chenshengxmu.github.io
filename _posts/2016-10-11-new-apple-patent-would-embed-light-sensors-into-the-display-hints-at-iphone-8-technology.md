* The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) today awarded Apple a patent describing a process for embedding light-sensing sensors into a mobile display. The invention, titled “Electronic devices with display-integrated light sensors,” potentially paves the way for next year’s iPhone.
* Apple’s new patent specifically mentions the ambient light and proximity sensors, which are found on the front face of the device, as being integrated into the display assembly.
* According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and pundits in the know, like Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, the iPhone 8—or whatever a 2017 iPhone (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone) ends up being called—should be a major design departure from prior models as it would supposedly get rid of the chin and forehead bezels by integrating Touch ID and the front-camera along with other sensors directly into the display.
* The invention outlines a mobile device with a display-integrated light sensor that includes a transparent cover layer, light-generating layers and a touch-sensitive layer.
* An ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor is interposed between the transparent cover layer and a display layer, whether it be OLED or LCD. Currently, these sensors are found above the display of current iPhone, iPad and Mac models.

* “The display-integrated light sensor may be a packaged light sensor that is integrated into the display layers of the display or may be formed from light-sensor components formed directly on a display circuitry layer such as the touch-sensitive layer or the thin-film transistor layer,” reads the patent abstract.

* AppleInsider explains:
* Certain embodiments dispose an ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor at the extreme edge of an OLED display abutting a touch-sensitive layer, for example.
* Alternatively, a handset could include a dedicated TFT layer onto which a variety of sensors are embedded. In each case, all display and sensor circuitry is protected by a transparent encapsulation layer made from glass or plastic.
* In other embodiments, one or more light sensors are integrated at the periphery of a display beyond the edge of touch sensitive traces to avoid touch sensitivity issues.
* The invention was first filed for in June 2015 and credits Apple engineers Erik G. de Jong, Anna-Katrina Shedletsky and Prashanth S. Holenarsipur as its inventors.
* USPTO last week granted Apple a patent for a Touch ID sensor that could work through an iPhone display.
