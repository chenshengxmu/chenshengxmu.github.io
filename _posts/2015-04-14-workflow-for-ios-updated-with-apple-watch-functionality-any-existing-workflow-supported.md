* Popular iOS app Workflow announced on Tuesday support for the Apple Watch, to bring automation to activities on your wrist.
* “Workflows automate things you do every day by connecting your favorite apps and services together. Now workflows can help you do less with your phone, and more from your wrist,” Workflow wrote on its new Apple Watch website. 
* Available to download in version 1.2 of its app, Workflow says it has over 200 actions that can be accessed from the wrist, including automating emails, managing notes, finding stores nearby, saving information to Dropbox, adding reminders, and more.
* Already a big Workflow fan? You’re in luck, as Workflows from your iPhone automatically appear on your watch, and any workflow runs on Apple Watch, no changes necessary.
* You can Swipe to the left to access the Workflow Gallery where you can browse through useful workflows designed for Apple Watch and download them instantly. And to launch a Workflow, you simply raise your wrist, swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and you arrive at Workflow’s Glance. Choose a workflow and run it with a single tap.
* You can download Workflow for iOS for $2.99 from the iTunes App Store.
