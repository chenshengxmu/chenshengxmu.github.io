* Following its inaugural iPhone 7 commercial focused on water resistance, dual cameras and other new features, Apple today posted a pair of new videos on its YouTube channel. Titled “Morning Ride” and “Midnight,” these commercials challenge customers to “brave the elements with the water-resistant iPhone 7” and take better low-light pictures thanks to all-new sensors that capture more light than before.
* Here’s “Morning Ride”.
* And this is the “Midnight” ad.
* How do you like these new commercials from Apple?
* They also released a new Apple Watch Series 2 ad today. For other product videos from the iPhone 7 event, see this article.
