* Adobe updated its Revel client for iOS today, bringing the app to version 2.3. The update brings about a few design tweaks, which make the app easier to use, and a handful of bug fixes, but the big news here is the bump in free storage.
* Free accounts for Adobe’s cloud-based Revel service now get 2GB of storage space, or enough for around 1000 photos. That’s quite the change from the previous model, where non-paying Revel users were limited to just 50 uploads/month…
* Here’s your 2.3 change log:
* What’s New in Version 2.3
* – Free Revel accounts now get 2GB of storage! Now you’ll be able to store and share around 1000 photos with your loved ones without worrying about a monthly limit.  – Tweaks to the look and feel of the app to make it easier to use. – Bug Fixes.
* For those unfamiliar with Revel, it’s like most other cloud storage services in that it allows you to upload photos to Adobe’s servers and then share them with friends and family. It’s private, backed up, and able to sync with all of your devices.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of the Revel app in the App Store for free. If you’d like unlimited photo and video storage, Adobe charges $5.99/month for premium accounts, which you can sign up for via an in-app purchase.
