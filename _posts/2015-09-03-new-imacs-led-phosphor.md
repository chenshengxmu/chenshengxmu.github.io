* Following his prediction a month ago that next-generation iMacs will launch very soon, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed more details in an analysis shared Thursday with clients, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider.
* The new iMac upgrade will feature a “much better display,” owing to the use of a LED phosphor material known as KSF to boost color saturation.
* In addition to a clearer screen with more vivid colors, the new iMacs should include Intel’s latest processors.
* iMac shipments could reach a KGI-estimated one million units in the September quarter, representing a 100 percent sequential growth from the June quarter.
* Kuo first mentioned the possibility of an iMac with an improved scree technology in a note issued to clients a month ago.
* “We believe Apple will introduce new iMac models in 3Q15, which are expected to have key selling points such as more powerful processors and much better display quality,” he wrote.
* “We predict the panel will use a LED phosphor material called KSF to notably boost color saturation.”
* The 27-inch iMac with ultra high resolution “Retina 5K” panel featuring a screen resolution of 5,120‑by‑2,880 pixels debuted last October. The flagship all-in-one then received a minor CPU boost in May 2015 while the rest of the family received a price cut.
* We have been also hearing that the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display could soon receive a resolution boost to eight megapixels, while the 21.5-inch model is expected to go from full HD to 4K resolution.
* iMacs are not expected to adopt Intel’s latest SkyLake processors until early-2016.
