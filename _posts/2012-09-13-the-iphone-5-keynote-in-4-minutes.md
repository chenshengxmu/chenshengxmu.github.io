title: The iPhone 5 keynote in 4 minutes
---
* Still haven’t seen the iPhone 5 Keynote? Strapped for time? We took the liberty to cut out all of the fluff, and other non-iPhone 5 hardware announcements from yesterday’s keynote. By doing so, we were able to cut it down to just a hair over 4 minutes, while still maintaining the vast majority of the important hardware details.
* If you haven’t yet seen the keynote, and you’re solely interested in the iPhone 5 hardware, then this is for you.
