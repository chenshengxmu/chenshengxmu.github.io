title: AndroidLock- A Better LockScreen to Protect Your iPhone
---
* There are several ways to protect your iPhone by restricting access to it from the lockscreen. You can use the stock feature that allows you to set a password containing 4 numbers. You can use this hack to add an alphanumeric password, or you can use AndroidLock.

* AndroidLock is a new application available in Cydia that brings Android’s lockscreen protection to the iPhone. After installing the app, you have to activate it in the Settings.app. To do so, you first have to create a pattern and save it. Then, in order to unlock your iPhone, you have to connect the dots according to the pattern that you previously created.
* On the example above, I have to go from bottom left to top right, then top right to top left, then top left to bottom right, in order to unlock the iPhone and gain access to the springboard. Obviously, you don’t see the pattern until you have completed it.
* I do think it’s a great alternative to setting an alphanumeric password. However, the downside for me is that I can’t really see the picture of iVan the dog anymore, which is the picture I have on my lockscreen.
* As I am traveling quite a bit these days, thus increasing my chances of losing my iPhone, I have set AndroiLock to protect it. I created a simple unlock pattern that doesn’t make it a pain in the butt for me to do, but it makes it very hard for a potential thief to figure out. That won’t protect me from losing or having my iPhone stolen, but at least it won’t be easy to access the data on it.
* What do you think? It’s a pretty nice mod, isn’t it?
