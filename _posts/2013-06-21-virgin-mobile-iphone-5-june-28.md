* After months of speculation, Virgin Mobile announced it will finally start carrying Apple’s iPhone 5 starting Friday, June 28. The handset will be offered on a subsidy basis on a two-year contract and with one of the Beyond Talk plans, starting at $35 a month for unlimited 4G LTE data and messaging. Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint and supports both Sprint’s CDMA 3G and LTE 4G radio technology (see coverage map here)…
* The entry-level 16GB iPhone 5 will cost $549.99 with a two year contract on a Beyond Talk plan. The 32/64GB iPhone 5 variants will be respectively priced at $649.99/$749.99. Virgin’s prices come in a $100 cheaper compared to Apple’s unlocked and contract-free iPhones.
* This is yet another prepaid option for would-be buyers, with rival Cricket Wireless, AT&T’s GoPhone prepaid brand also offering Apple’s device, along with many regional U.S. carriers.
* By comparison, T-Mobile currently offers the 16GB iPhone 5 for $580 contract-free, while Straight Talk values the device at $649, without a contract..
* All Beyond Talk plans include 2.5GB/month of 3G/4G full speed data. And because Virgin is a prepaid carrier, all of their plans are no-contract.

* Virgin says folks can receive a $5 monthly discount on their chosen plan provided they register and sign up for automatic monthly payments with a credit card, debit card or PayPal account.
* The device will be available through Virgin Mobile’s website, at participating Virgin Mobile dealers and at its exclusive national retail distributor, RadioShack.
* Virgin started offering prepaid iPhone 4S models last summer.
* The carrier is currently running an interesting promotion which promises a fifteen percent discount on prepaid iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models.
