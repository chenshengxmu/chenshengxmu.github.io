* In my opinion, Touch ID is one of the best new iOS features to come about in years. It’s an excellent mix of hardware and software that solves a real problem. I use Touch ID each and every day on my iPhone, and I find myself slightly disappointed every time I try to hold my thumb on my old iPad mini and nothing happens.
* As you know, Touch ID allows users to store up to five fingerprints. In turn, any of the registered prints can be used to unlock your iPhone and authenticate purchases associated with your Apple ID, such as App Store purchases.
* But how does one go about remembering which fingers were used to setup Touch ID? Inside, we’ll show you how easy it is to do so.
* First, you’ll need to venture into the Touch ID settings. This can be found by going to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. Once there, you’ll see a list of fingerprints under the fingerprints heading. You can have up to five prints assigned to Touch ID, but you don’t have to assign all five if you don’t want to.
* Once there, simply touch the Touch ID sensor like you normally would when you want to make a purchase or unlock your phone. If the finger you used is currently one of the registered prints listed under the fingerprints section, you’ll see the a gray flash to signify the assigned print.
* After identifying the fingers associated with the assigned prints in Touch ID’s settings, it’s best to assign names to the fingers for future identification. In order to do so, tap the edit button in the upper right-hand corner of the page, and this will place you into edit mode. You can then tap on the names of each finger, and assign your own custom name.
* As you can see from the video walkthrough, I renamed two of the fingerprints to “right thumb,” and “right index.” This allows me to easily identify the assigned finger whenever I open the Touch ID preferences in the future.
* Do you still use Touch ID on your iPhone, or have you gone back to the animalistic passcode lock full time? What are your thoughts on the technology now that you’ve had plenty of time to put it through its paces? Be sure to share your opinions in the comment section below.
