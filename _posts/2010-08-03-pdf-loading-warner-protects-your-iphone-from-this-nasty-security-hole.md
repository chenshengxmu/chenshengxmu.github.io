* Yesterday we told you that the exploit used by JailbreakMe to jailbreak your iPhone was a major security issue as it can download pretty much anything to your iPhone, including some malicious code, via a PDF glitch. We gave you a manual fix but there is now an easier way to patch this bad exploit that puts your iPhone at risk.
* You can simply go to Cydia and download PDF Loading Warner. It’s a free app that will display a warning before allowing your iPhone to download a PDF file. This will avoid you being duped by a malicious software.
* While this app gives you another layer of security, you’re in no way safe from having your iPhone compromised, at least until Apple officially patches this exploit. On the safe side though, chances of you being hacked are very thin so don’t stress out too much over it.
