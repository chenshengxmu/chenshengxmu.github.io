* Google I/O, the search giant’s version of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, is kicking off this year on Wednesday, May 18, at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California and what better way to keep up with the conference than an iPhone app from Google.
* The official Google I/O 2016 app, like Apple’s own WWDC for iPhone app, lets you follow conference news, explore tracks and speakers, watch session videos, enjoy a live stream of the keynote and more, right on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* “The official Google I/O 2016 conference app is your co-pilot to navigate the conference, whether you’re attending in-person or remotely,” says Google.
* With this app, you can guide yourself using the built-in conference map, explore the conference agenda with details on themes, tracks and speakers, add events to a personalized schedule, get reminders before events in your schedule start, watch the keynote and sessions live stream and sync your schedule between all of your devices and the I/O website.
* Grab the Google I/O 2016 app for free on the App Store.
