* There’s been a lot going on behind the scenes in the jailbreak community recently. With the release of both the H3lix and LiberiOS jailbreaks and the confirmation that Saurik would update Cydia for iOS 11, it seems like we might see another season of jailbreaking after all.
* In this meantime, this post serves to provide a brief summary of all the new jailbreak tweaks released throughout the past week. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorite releases and then outline the rest afterward.
* Without further ado, let’s get started…

* AppColorBadges is a new free jailbreak tweak that colorizes your icon badges so that they match the icon they represent. For example, Twitter badges appear blue, and Messages badges appear green.
* The tweak brings a subtler style to your badges when compared to the stock, eye-jarring red badges on a stock device. While it looks nicer in some respects, it can also make your badges blend in with your icons, which sometimes makes them more challenging to notice at a glance.
* You can learn more about AppColorBadges and what the tweak can do for you in our full review.

* With all the packages available in Cydia today, both new and old, it’s not always easy to discern which ones will work with your version of iOS.
* tweakCompatible is a new free jailbreak tweak that aims to help with this problem. It utilizes crowd-sourced data to let you check whether any tweak in Cydia will work on your device.
* Users can also report any package as either working or not working, and the tweak logs that response into an online database for others to use.
* You can learn more about tweakCompatible and how it works in our full hands-on review.
* FitnessClearScrolling: Makes the Activity app’s user interface “clearer” while scrolling up and down (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* Hid3x: Hides the semi-untethered jailbreak app from your Home screen when it isn’t needed (free via BigBoss repository – review)
* MyTextNotifications: Customize the title text of all your incoming notifications (free via BigBoss repository)
* WeChatRedEnvelopesHelper: An add-on for the WeChat app (free via BigBoss repository)
* That just about wraps things up for this week’s roundup, but we’ll continue to keep you updated as new jailbreak tweaks surface. You might also consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope.
* In the meantime, check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special from last week. We also have a plethora of dedicated roundups that can help you find new tweaks for tricking out your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
