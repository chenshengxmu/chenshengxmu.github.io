* One of the things that really grinds my gears is when I get sucked into group iMessage conversations that I really don’t want to be in. Although rare, sometimes people do it just to wish a bulk of people a good holiday without sending individual messages, but other times people do it just to be annoying.
* Unfortunately, Apple makes things even more difficult on you by limiting the ability to leave a group iMessage conversation to when there are four or more people in it, so if you’re being dragged against your will into a three-way iMessage conversation, then you’ll find the button to leave will be grayed out.
* That’s where a new free jailbreak tweak called AntiSocial by Tony Kraft comes in handy, as it enables the “Leave this Conversation” button even when you’re in a three-way iMessage conversation.

* I think the name is very fitting for this sort of tweak, as people who aren’t socialites and don’t want their iPhone blowing up every time Tom, Dick, and Harry all decide to send a message to one another in the background are going to agree that AntiSocial probably fits their needs.
* Other people just hate being brought into group conversations because it exposes their contact information to everyone involved, potentially opening you up to phone spam and trolls who won’t leave you alone.
* Using the “Leave This Conversation” button helps to eliminate future notifications that arise from the group iMessage conversation, which means everyone who’s involved with the conversation can continue to have their fun while you butt out.
* The feature is only available to iMessage users, which is something worth mentioning. So unfortunately, if you’re stuck in an SMS conversation, the same rules don’t apply because when it comes to SMS, messages are sent to users directly rather than being regulated through one of Apple’s iMessage servers.
* Even if you’ve never been dragged into a group conversation before, it never hurts to arm yourself with the power to leave a group conversation if you want to, just in case it ever happens in the future.
* AntiSocial doesn’t come with any options to configure and it can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices.
