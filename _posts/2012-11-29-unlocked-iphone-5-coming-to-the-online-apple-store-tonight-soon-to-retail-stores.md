* Like an elusive unicorn, the unlocked iPhone 5 remains a pipedream in the United States, where the government doesn’t require telcos to offer unlocked, contract-free devices alongside subsidized ones, like in Italy, France and elsewhere.
* If you’re unwilling to commit your soul to your carrier just to get your hands on an iPhone 5, you may wanna keep a close eye on the online Apple Store at around 9pm tonight as it’s been reported factory-unlocked devices will appear as early as this midnight…
* Additionally, word on the street is that the iPhone maker will be offering the sought-after device in its own brick-and-mortar stores sooner than later.
* The unlocked 5 prices will likely be $649/$749/$849 for the 16/32/64GB version. Well, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out.
* Of course, Apple’s retail outlets in Canada are selling the iPhone 5 factory-unlocked as we speak.
* Apple retail stores in Canada are selling the iPhone factory unlocked starting today.

* “Apple’s chain of retail stores will begin selling the unlocked devices soon, but have yet to be provided a start sales date”, Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac writes.
* We’re also hearing that Apple will expand its Apple Store Personal Pickup program to allow customers to reserve devices at any time of the day, not just after 10 PM.
* Here’s how to check if your iPhone is factory-unlocked.
* can you buy an iPhone 5 with no contract at best buy? just full retail they saying no

* It’s been a little over two months sine the iPhone 5 became available, prompting questions over this lack of factory-unlocked offering (unlocked iPhone 4S units became available a month following the launch).
* Of course, if you’re purchasing a Verizon iPhone 5, you’re already getting an unlocked device.
* Have you been holding out for a contract-free iPhone 5?
