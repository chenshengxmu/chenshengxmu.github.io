* WhatsApp users will be happy to hear that the popular messaging service has updated its iOS client this afternoon. The update brings the app to version 2.11.3 and includes new features and improvements.
* Most of the improvements have to do with the recently-added voice messaging feature, particularly in regards to accessibility, but perhaps the biggest change is that you can once again send longer videos…
* Here’s your 2.11.3 change log:
* – new video picker (can send longer videos again) – improvements in Voice Messaging (especially in Accessibility parts) – other VoiceOver fixes and improvements – many bug fixes and performance improvements
* While the bug fixes and improvements are nice, users will likely be most pleased with the new video picker, which lets you send longer videos. Now, instead of a 45 second limit, you can send up to 1:30 clips.
* WhatsApp is arguably one of the most popular cross-platform messaging apps on the market. Earlier this month, the company announced it now has 300 million active users, sending 11 billion messages per day.
* The app recently changed its business model on iOS, going from $0.99 up front to free with a yearly subscription. It’s free for the first year and $0.99 per year after that. WhatsApp is available in the App Store.
