* With iOS 11, Apple has inexplicably removed the popular app-switching gesture that was available on iPhones with 3D Touch. Fortunately, it’s just temporary because Apple’s reportedly confirmed bringing that tremendously useful feature back with a future iOS 11.x update.
* Apple previously acknowledged that the app-switching gesture was intentionally removed from iOS 11, but now software head Craig Federighi, replying to an email from MacRumors reader Adam Zahn, has said they’ll be bringing it back in an upcoming iOS 11.x update.
* Question from Adam Zahn:
* Could we at least make the 3D Touch app switch gesture an option in iOS 11 so that I could retain the ability to switch apps that way instead of having to double tap the Home button?
* Response from Craig Federighi:
* Hi Adam,
* We regretfully had to temporarily drop support for this gesture due to a technical constraint. We will be bringing it back in an upcoming iOS 11.x update.
* Thanks (and sorry for the inconvenience)!
* – Craig
* MacRumors has verified that the email exchange has passed through mail servers with an IP address range linked to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California.
* In case you’re not familiar with it, and have an iPhone 6s lying around somewhere running iOS 9 or iOS 10 , you can press firmly on the left side of the screen and drag right to the middle of the screen, then let go to get to your app switcher just like that.
* The video embedded below shows the gesture in action.

* You can also press the left edge of the screen lightly then drag all the way to the right to switch between two apps, allowing you to quickly switch back to the last app in one swipe.
* Has this news made your day or what?
* Sound off in the comments!
