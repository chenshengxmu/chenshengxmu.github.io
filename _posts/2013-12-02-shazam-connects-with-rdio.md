* Shazam‘s music fingerprinting app for the iPhone and iPad is continuously getting better and more useful after each new update. Right following the September 18 release of iOS 7, Shazam mobile apps were immediately updated with iOS 7-friendly design and technologies.
* And just a month ago, the app was refreshed with the handy artist updates, the ability to see what your friends have tagged and a new newsfeed-like interface for real-time updates and interactions with the Shazam community.
* On Monday, Shazam got bumped to version 7.2 which brings a very interesting feature: if you’re a Rdio user, you can now listen to your Shazam tracks as an Rdio playlist. A few other goodies are included in this Shazam update, listed after the break…
* You can now connect with Rdio to listen to your Shazam tracks as an Rdio playlist, release notes state.
* Additionally, Shazam 7.2 features a visual tweak when sharing Shazam tags by email: your cover artwork for Shazam content that’s linked in email messages is now larger.
* The software also fixes disappearing navigation on Explore screen for iPhone 4 users, improves display of TV results from News and restores YouTube video playback for iPad.
* The newly-added ability to listen to Shazam tracks on Rdio is interesting in light of Rdio’s recent update that brought back the much-wanted Recommendations feature.
* As a result, listening to your tagged Shazam tracks in Rdio will now help Rdio’s recommendation engine build a better profile of your musical tastes, in turn allowing for more relevant recommendations.
* The aforementioned new capabilities were added to both Shazam and Shazam Encore.
* Shazam is free in the App Store.
* Although optimized for iOS 7 design and features, the 28MB universal download will run on any iOS device capable of supporting iOS 6 or later.
* The premium Shazam Encore is a $7 download.
* Going premium unlocks all features, including full track playback with Spotify and an ad-free experience.
