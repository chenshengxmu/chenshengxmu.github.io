* For Finnish developer Rovio, there’s no slowing down, their Angry Birds franchise just keeps chugging along.
* According to the latest official data released this morning, the Angry Birds games have just passed a whopping one billion cumulative downloads across all platforms.
* The number includes both free and paid downloads and is an astounding milestone for the popular franchise that debuted on the App Store in December of 2009…
* According to a blog post, fans should “keep their eyes peeled” for what’s coming up next from Rovio.
* Here, more stats:
* • 400 billion birds launched • 266 combined game levels played • 300 million minutes of game play per day • 44 billion collected stars  • 200,000 years of combined game play
* The company’s latest earnings report has revealed that Angry Birds games generated 648 million downloads by the end of 2011.
* The series now has more than 200 million active users monthly and helped Rovio book a cool $106.3 million in 2011 revenue.
* Here’s a nice little clip accompanying the announcement.
* According to some, the short clip could indicate that Rovio might have acquired rights to Casey’s Contraptions, which would be pretty huge.
* Espoo, Finland-headquartered Rovio files as one of the most profitable game developers out there because its business encompasses games, advertising and merchandising.
* The word on the street is that Rovio will go with an IPO some time in 2013.
* Anders Lindeberg, Rovio’s head of investor relations, told Reuters that “this company is preparing itself and getting ready”.
* According to AllThingsD, Rovio hasn’t decided yet if – or when, for that matter – they will file for an IPO.
* The company also hinted that “something big is coming” following the release of Angry Birds Space, the latest installment in the series.
* In the 35 days since the March 22 launch, Angry Birds Space hit 50 million download on all platforms.
* Man, one billion downloads, that’s a hell of a milestone, no?
