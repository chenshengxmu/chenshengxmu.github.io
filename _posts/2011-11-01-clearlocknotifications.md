* Similar in vein to the just discussed NCQuickDismiss — ClearLockNotifications makes it easy to clear out iOS 5 notifications that happen to pile up on your Lock screen.
* It’s weird that Apple doesn’t think to add simple items like this to the default version of iOS, but again, I guess that’s what the jailbreak community is for…
* Not surprisingly, ClearLockNotifications was developed by moeseth — the same developer behind NCQuickDismiss, and a host of other interesting tweaks available on Cydia.
* If you want to give ClearLockNotifications a try for yourself, then head over to Cydia where you can get it for free today.
* Are you going to give it a shot?
