* You’ve got plenty of dual charging options for your Apple Watch and iPhone out there, but Satechi has announced a new one here at CES 2018. We got an early look before it launches this year.
* Using USB-C, the dock connects to your own wall charger and provides power to both your iPhone, and your Apple Watch. Unfortunately, you need to provide your own cables, but otherwise it is a modular design that works in many orientations.

* I like the aluminum design that mimics the others in Satechi’s lineup, and really like that they chose to use USB-C.
* Let me know what you think of Satechi’s latest desktop accessory down in the comments.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
