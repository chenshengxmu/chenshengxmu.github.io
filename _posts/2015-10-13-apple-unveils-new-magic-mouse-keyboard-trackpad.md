* In addition to refreshing its iMac lineup with enhanced screen technology and faster chips across all models, giving the 21.5-inch iMac a brand new Retina 4K display and removing non-5K Retina models from the 27-inch lineup, Apple has also introduced a trio of new accessories today.
* As rumored before, the second-generation Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad have been announced, as well as an all-new aluminum keyboard marketed under the Magic Keyboard moniker.
* All three accessories feature a noticeably more solid internal structure and quality feel while sharing some common technologies.
* For example, gone are standard AA batteries that need to be replaced or recharged every few weeks as the new Magic devices now feature rechargeable batteries that’ll last about a month or more on a full charge.
* To recharge the battery, you just plug one end of the Lightning-to-USB charging cable into the new Lightning port on your Magic device and the other end into your computer or charger’s USB port. As a bonus, the new Magic accessories pair with your Mac as soon as they are plugged into the computer with the charging cable.
* The Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 also feature way more power-efficient Bluetooth 4.0 networking (the previous accessories were Bluetooth 2.0).
* The Magic Trackpad 2 includes Apple’s force-sensing Force Touch technology.
* Featuring a new scissor mechanism, the new Magic Keyboard has lower profile, is 33 more stabilized and sports a refreshed design that takes up thirteen percent less space on your desktop.
* Apple describes its second-generation Magic Mouse as lighter and sturdier than before. The button-less mouse (actually, the entire mouse is a giant button) sports touch sensitive surface like before and now has an optimized foot design for a smoother glide.
* The new wireless trackpad has a 29 percent larger surface and brings Force Touch to the desktop for the first time, which also makes it nearly two times more expensive than the previous model.
* With Force Touch, owners of older Mac notebooks and desktops can now take advantage of force-sensing which adds a new dimension to OS X’s user interface.
* The trackpad enables a range of new Force Touch gestures, including the new Force click to quickly look up a word, preview a file or bring up a map from an address.
* The aforesaid goodies come at a price: the new accessories are pricier than their previous models. Here’s the full price list:
* Unfortunately, the new Magic devices seem to have replaced Apple’s previous-generation mouse, keyboard and trackpad, which used to retail at the following prices:
* You might be able to buy the old, less expensive accessories from authorized resellers, while supplies last.
* The new $99 Magic Keyboard, $79 Magic Mouse 2 and $129 Magic Trackpad 2 are available today from the Apple Online Store, Apple’s retail stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* Every new iMac comes standard with the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. However, the Magic Trackpad 2 is an optional purchase.

* Speaking of new iMacs, the 21.5-inch non-Retina model is available in $1,099 and $1,299 configurations. The new 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display starts at $1,499. The 27-incher comes in three models starting at $1,799, $1,999 and $2,299. The previous-generation non-Retina 27-inch models have been removed from sale.
