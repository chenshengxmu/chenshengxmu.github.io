* Apple is working with Consumer Reports to better understand their MacBook Pro battery tests, according to Phil Schiller. The company’s SVP of marketing sent out a tweet late Friday night, saying CR’s test results don’t match Apple’s data.
* Schiller’s comments follow Consumer Reports’ scathing review of Apple’s new MacBook Pro, in which the product-testing magazine said, for the first time ever, that it could not recommend the laptop due to inconsistencies in battery life.
* Here’s what Consumer Reports said:
* Typically, a laptop’s battery life may vary from one trial to another by less than 5 percent. To arrive at our final battery life score we average those measurements together.
* However, with the widely disparate figures we found in the MacBook Pro tests, an average wouldn’t reflect anything a consumer would be likely to experience in the real world. For that reason, we are reporting the lowest battery life results, and using those numbers in calculating our final scores. It’s the only time frame we can confidently advise a consumer to rely on if he or she is planning use the product without access to an electrical outlet.
* And here’s Schiller’s response:
* Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO

* Battery performance complaints have been aplenty since the MacBook Pro launched in November, and Apple responded by removing macOS’s “inaccurate” time indicator. Some users have reported improved battery life with macOS 10.12.2.
