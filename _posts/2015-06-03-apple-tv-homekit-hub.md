* We’ve known since CES 2015 the Apple TV would play a central role in Apple’s HomeKit ecosystem, dating back to October 2014 when HomeKit support first surfaced in an Apple TV Software beta.
* Wednesday, a newly published Apple support document has acknowledged that the streaming box acts as a bridge between HomeKit devices and your mobile life.
* “If you have an Apple TV (3rd generation or later) with software version 7.0 or later, you can control your HomeKit-enabled accessories when you’re away from home using your iOS device,” reads the document.
* In order to use Siri commands to remotely control your HomeKit-certified accessories, you’ll need to sign in with the same Apple ID on your iOS device and Apple TV.

* Upon signing into iCloud, your Apple TV will register as a HomeKit-capable hub. Your home and accessory data will be stored securely using CloudKit and paired keys will be encrypted and synchronized through Keychain.
* If you don’t own an Apple TV, dedicated HomeKit-enabled hubs are available for purchase, including SmartLinc’s $150 Insteon Hub that launched yesterday.
* In order to use HomeKit, you’ll need to use an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 8.1 or later and purchase one of HomeKit-certified appliances.
* As I mentioned yesterday, the fine print for Elgato’s new Eve lineup of HomeKit accessories explicitly mentions that controlling HomeKit-enabled accessories away from home “requires a third-generation Apple TV with Apple TV software 7.0 or later and an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 8.1 or later.”

* The first wave of HomeKit products started dropping yesterday with iHome, SmartLinc, Elgato and Ecobee, to mention just a few.
* Apple has a running list of ‘Works with Apple HomeKit’ accessories here.
