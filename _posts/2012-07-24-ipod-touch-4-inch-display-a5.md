* Hot on the heels of last night’s note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, comes a new report regarding the future of the iPod touch. If it holds true, the mp3 player could be getting quite the makeover this fall.
* According to the new dispatch, the next-generation iPod touch will feature the same 4-inch display that the new iPhone is rumored to get, as well as an A5 processor and other internal upgrades…
* Macotakara, a credible source for Apple information, reports:
* “According to asian source, new iPod touch (5th generation) will have a 4 inch LCD which is the same size with coming iPhone 5.
* CPU or other spec is considered to be the same with iPhone 4S, and has different back-case design, which will be not mirror polished but buffed aluminum one And it seems to be prepared black and white color model.”
* The iPod touch line has gone largely unchanged during the past two years, so it wouldn’t surprise us to see the device get a significant upgrade this fall. And if you break down the report, none of the stuff that’s mentioned seems all that far-fetched.
* For example, if Apple is expected to bump up the iPhone’s display from 3.5 to 4-inches, it would make sense from both a manufacturing standpoint, and a consistency standpoint, to do the same to the iPod. And Apple’s not going to throw the two-year old A4 processor in this thing, so the A5 chip from the iPhone 4S sounds like the obvious choice.
* Put together, it seems like Apple could have a real winner on its hands. Especially if it’s able to keep the low-end model under that $200 price point. Apple is expected to unveil the new iPod touch, a new iPhone and a smaller iPad sometime this fall.
* So, who wants one?
