* Apple is trialing a new system, currently limited to its Canadian customers, that makes it easier for people to reserve a replacement battery for their iPhone through the support website.
* As first spotted by MacRumors, a new “Reserve a Battery” link was recently added to Apple’s support website in Canada. Not available elsewhere yet, it lets iPhone 6 or newer owners reserve a battery online and have Apple contact them when it’s available at their chosen store.
* “For iPhone 6 or later, choose Reserve a Battery and we’ll contact you when a battery is available at your preferred Apple Store,” reads a notice on the support website.
* After choosing Canada as your preferred country from the popup menu on the Apple Support website, you must sign in with your Apple ID and select the option Battery, Power and Charging, then choose Battery Replacement → Reserve a Battery.
* An anonymous tipster told the publication that Canada is a trial country, meaning the Cupertino firm might expand this battery reservation system to other regions in the near future.
* Earlier today, we learned that iOS 11.3’s promised battery health and power management features will be added to a developer beta in February. The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are probing the iPhone maker over CPU throttling.
* “Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love,” Apple wrote in its response to the government investigation.
* “Making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that,” the company added.
