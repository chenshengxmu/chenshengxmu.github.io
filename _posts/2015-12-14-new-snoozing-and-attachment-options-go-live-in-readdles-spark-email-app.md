* Just a few days after adding support for Microsoft Exchange accounts for work-related emails, Readdle’s popular Spark email app for the iPhone received another major update in the App Store last evening.
* Bumped to version 1.4, Spark now includes several new snoozing options and new ways to attach images and files. With customizable snooze times and related notifications, staying on top of your emails is now easier than before.
* You also get a dedicated button for attaching images to an email message, the ability to chose image size to keep attachment size under control and switch between attaching actual files or sending links to files on your Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive.
* Similar to the defunct Mailbox app, Sparrow lets you snooze emails that you want to deal with later. In the latest version, snooze times are fully customized to your liking. For example, you can create snooze times for This Weekend, Next Month, Tomorrow, Weekend and so forth that will pop up in an overlay.

* And if you flip the new Alert toggle at the bottom of snooze alert options, you shall receive a notification when a snoozed email is moved back to your inbox.
* With Spark 1.4 for iPhone, you also get a dedicated Attach Image button in the compose sheet to easily pick one or more images from your Camera roll. Like Apple’s Mail app, Spark also lets you choose between various image sizes.

* This should come in handy when attaching a bunch of high-resolution images to a message that would otherwise result in huge attachment size.
* Inline image previews are now bigger than before, too. And lastly, Spark 1.4 includes brand new toggles for choosing whether you want to attach an actual file stored on your Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive, or send person a link to it.

* The team is putting finishing touches on a native iPad interface in Spark, with the update scheduled to go live shortly. A Mac edition of Spark is currently under development though launch timeframe isn’t known yet.

* By the way, Apple has picked Spark as The Best App of the App Store in 2015.
