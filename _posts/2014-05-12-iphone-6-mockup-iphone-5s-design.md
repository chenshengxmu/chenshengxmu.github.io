* With everyone and their brother 3D printing iPhone 6 mockups, virtually every single day brings another iPhone 6 “leak” that wants to go viral. There’s just too much stuff proliferating out there so iDownloadBlog usually only covers the material we specifically deem newsworthy.
* This would typically entail photos and footage that bring something new to the conversation, be it a never-before-seen angle, an interesting design choice or other curious detail.
* Today’s video is no different.
* Created by an Italian enthusiast blog, it pits an unusually detailed physical iPhone 6 mockup against the iPhone 5s and the fifth-generation iPod touch, showing the supposed design differences from various angles…
* The clip, originally posted by Macitynet.it and relayed by MacRumors, can be seen right below. It shows a final mockup of a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 based on the previously leaked technical drawing.
* Yes, they protected the iPhone 5s’s cover glass with a plastic film.
* A few observations…
* Clearly, you can see a noticeably thinner appearance: the iPhone 6 will allegedly be between 6 and 7mm thick, its slim profile accentuated further by the rounded design with tapered edges. Design-wise, the physical mockup takes more cues from the iPad Air than from previous iPhones.
* And here’s another one comparing the iPhone 6 mockup to Apple’s fifth-generation iPod touch.
* I’m not sure about that round-shaped LED hole on the back given True Tone flash on the iPhone 5s needs a pill-shaped hole, but that’s what the rumors seem to be hinting at.
* Apple is said to relocate the power/sleep button to the right side to allow easier one-handed use. Also, the volume buttons on the left side should now be elongated rather than rounded.
* Again, this physical made-in-China mockup shows what the iPhone 6 could look like, based on the supposedly leaked schematic.
* Accessory vendors commonly use dummy units to study new designs because Apple does not share technical drawings of unreleased products in advance.
* The mockup weighs 117 grams versus the iPhone 5s’s 112 grams (iPhone 5c: 132 grams; iPhone 4s: 140 grams). Another notable observation: the edges of the glass cover seem to be slightly curved – like on Nokia’s Lumias – most likely to enable easy one-handed use and smoother swiping.
* What do you think about the comparison videos?
* Did I forget to mention a particular detail?
* Want to 3D print your own 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 mockups?
