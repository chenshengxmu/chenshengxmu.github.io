* The Internet giant Google today refreshed its mobile productivity apps in the App Store—Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides—adding support for the iPad Pro’s 12.9-inch screen along with other minor improvements.
* Although Google’s word processor, spreadsheet and presentation apps now take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s increased screen size and resolution, these apps are yet to support iOS 9’s new iPad multitasking modes, like Split View and Slide Over.
* In the updated Docs app, you can now enable the word-counting feature, useful if you plan on writing and editing longer documents. And in slides, you can now create an account more easily than before.
* As mentioned, all three apps are now compatible with the iPad Pro and also include a bunch of bug fixes and performance improvements.
* In other Google updates, Chrome for iOS was bumped to version 48.0.2564.104 today to addresses the following issues that were introduced in the previous release:
* In addition, Google Drive was updated yesterday with the ability to view and restore files in your Trash and add colors to folders. Moreover, links to Drive tapped in stock apps like Messages, Safari and Mail now open in the Drive app.
* You can download Docs, Slides, Sheets, Chrome and Drive free in the App Store.
