* Dev Team member MuscleNerd has made it known that things are looking good as far as the 4.3.x untethered jailbreak is concerned.
* On Monday, we reported on the fact that an untether had indeed been accomplished. Shortly thereafter, via Twitter, MuscleNerd confirmed that the Dev Team is implementing that untether into their upcoming jailbreak.
* While there is of course no solid ETA for a release of the jailbreak, judging from the screenshot posted on his Twitter account, it’s probably not that far off…

* This screenshot is a confirmation that progress is being made, as the jailbreak portion has obviously been accomplished, and they’re working on getting Cydia working correctly, but aren’t quite there just yet.
* I’m really looking forward to this jailbreak; reaping the benefits that Apple implemented with iOS 4.3 along with enjoying the flexibility that jailbreaking offers sounds like a win/win proposition to me.
* Who else can’t wait?
