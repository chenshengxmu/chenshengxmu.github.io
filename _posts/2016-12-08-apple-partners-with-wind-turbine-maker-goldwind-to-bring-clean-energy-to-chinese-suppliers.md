* In an effort to help bring more clean energy to its Chinese suppliers, Apple and wind turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology (also known as Goldwind) have entered into a cooperative joint venture agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing spotted by the South China Morning Post newspaper.
* Beijing Tianrun New Energy Investment, a Goldwind subsidiary, will transfer its thirty percent stakes in four project firms that will stay subsidiaries under Goldwind for stock exchange purposes.
* “Apple is committed to powering all of its facilities around the world with 100 per cent renewable energy, and is now working with its suppliers to power Apple’s product manufacturing with renewable energy,” Goldwind said.
* The article doesn’t name Chinese suppliers that would benefit from clean energy provided as part of the Apple-Goldwind deal. The iPhone maker recently applauded Lens Technology, one of its suppliers, on agreeing to switch to 100 percent renewable energy in all its Apple glass production by 2018.
* Lens will use wind energy to power its two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province which are used for Apple manufacturing. The move will avoid nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.
* Apple has committed to using 100 percent renewable energy across all of the facilities it operates, including its retail stores, the upcoming iSpaceship building and more. An upcoming 200-megawatt Apple solar farm will help deliver more than four gigawatts of clean energy worldwide, half of that in China.
