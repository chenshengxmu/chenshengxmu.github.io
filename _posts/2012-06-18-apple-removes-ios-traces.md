title: Apple begins removing traces of upcoming products from iOS

* It looks like Tim Cook wasn’t joking underscoring Apple would “double down on secrecy” during his fireside chat with Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher at the D10: All Things D conference. As noted by TUAW, the latest beta of iOS 6 lacks certain references to future Apple devices that have long been the staple of the rumor mill’s crystal ball peering. Not like this changes anything, mind you…
* The USBDeviceConfiguration.plist file in iOS is typically the place to look for hints as it contains a bunch of string references to current and unreleased Apple hardware.
* For example, in iOS 5 betas an “iPhone4,1” reference alluded to an unreleased iPhone model, a major revision, which later became known as the iPhone 4S. The USBDeviceConfiguration.plist file is still there, Apple just removed all traces of unknown hardware.
* Last December, Apple played a practical joke on eagle-eyed journalists who relentlessly comb through the closely-watched configuration file. Jokers as they are, Apple planted dozens of references to fake products, like “iPad10,1”, “iPhone11,3”, “iPod11,1” and “AppleTV8,3”.
* Of course, Apple’s latest move won’t stop people from trying. More importantly, hints to unreleased hardware can still be found in other locations in iOS, for those who know where to look.
* If anything, this is Apple’s way of telling us that they’re serious about not helping the media guesstimate what they’re working on.
* Why double down on secrecy?
* Apple may remove evidence of upcoming products from iOS code as much as it wants, but this won’t stop people from envisioning what the next iPhone could look like.

* For starters, it kills the surprise factor.
* A good example is the new iOS 6 Maps app which completely leaked out ahead of the WWDC announcement, as did a number of other headline features.
* Secondly, rumors – especially if fake – provide Apple with tons of free coverage otherwise worth tens of millions of dollars.
* Unfortunately for Apple, removing code references does nothing: credible publications have their moles at 1 Infinite Loop and Cupertino will have to significantly strengthen their CIA-grade internal security measures.
* A good example of this is 9to5Mac, a well-connected publication with deeply entrenched sources where I used to work as News Editor prior to my iDB gig.
* As noted by Businessweek, 9to5Mac (in spite of hate talk) pretty much leaked everything there was to leak about Apple’s keynote announcements, completely ruining the surprise factor.
* Too much rumors and guessing work can affect Apple’s bottom line.
* Take last year’s wild speculation concerning the iPhone 5 which called for an all-new form factor and summer introduction. These baseless stories, however, did manage to convince a bunch of people to withhold their planned purchases, causing a notable dip in September quarter iPhone sales.
* Even CEO Tim Cook said as much in a conference call with investors.
* In a repeat of 2011, analysts now warn that crazy rumors and nonsensical reporting surrounding the next iPhone could also impact summer sales.
* So why is iDB covering this rumor biz?
* Firstly, most of our surveyed readers voted for rumor coverage in a poll.
* Secondly, without rumors there would be little to report on in terms of factual news as Apple never announces or comments on unreleased products.
* And finally, some rumors prove true and as such are an integral part of any comprehensive coverage.
* Without rumors, tech reporting would be a lot less fun.
* Plus, we do our best to separate rumors from facts and we trust our readers can digest all the pieces of information we present and form their own opinion.
* What do you think, is it possible to really obscure all pieces of valid evidence from iOS betas?
