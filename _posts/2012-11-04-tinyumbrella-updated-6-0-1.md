* The popular SHSH blob-saver TinyUmbrella received an update today. Notcom, the developer, added support to the utility for the newly-released iOS 6.0.1 firmware, and both the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini…
* Here’s the post from the TU blog:
* “I’ve updated TU to support iOS 6 and 6.0.1. The new iPad mini and iPad 4 are also supported as well as the new iphone 4 stealth revision.
* Sorry for the delay folks. I’m still working on some pretty dang well needed changes to TU. The wait will be worth it…”
* It looks like Apple has quit signing iOS 6, so it’s too late to save your blobs for that firmware. But we recommend having SHSH backups for all devices and iOS versions, so make sure to grab your 6.0.1 blobs as well.
* If you are looking for help using TinyUmbrella, we have a step-by-step tutorial on how to use it. But if you’re familiar with the app and are just looking to grab the latest version, you can find it on our Downloads page.
* Any questions?
