* Drexel University has formed a partnership with the Free Library of Philadelphia to provide an iPad vending machine to the University’s students and local residents, to make a dozen iPads available for further learning. 
* The vending machine is seamless, located in the University’s Dana and David Dornsife Center for Neighborhood Partnerships. It’s as easy as someone with a library card or student ID walking up to the kiosk and swiping, to use the iPad for up to four hours.
* Drexel University is likely using Apple’s mobile device management (MDM) platform, allowing the University to remove information entered on the iPad during the rental period once the iPad is returned to its slot in the kiosk – mitigating obvious privacy concerns.
* Drexel University and the Free Library of Philadelphia selected the apps installed on the iPads to be part of a suite of tools, including Browzine, Hoopla Digital, Mango Languages, Overdrive and Zinio. Of course with the App Store, students and residents have access to other education apps than just the ones installed.
* “The apps downloaded on the iPads have been specifically chosen to support the digital literacy needs for children, teens and adults,” Siobhan Reardon, president and director of the Free Library of Philadelphia, said.
* The iPad vending machine follows a MacBook vending machine launched by the University in 2013 that allows students and residents five hours of use.
