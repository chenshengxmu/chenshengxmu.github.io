* Episode 41: We got a new podcast cover so as to better differentiate Let’s Talk Jailbreak from Let’s Talk iOS. In this episode we talk about Surenix’s update to Ayecon for iOS 7, the new Controllers for All tweak that allows you to turn your iOS device into a full-fledged gaming console, and clarify some more key details on Cydia purchases.
