* Back in action this Sunday, we have been watching the comment section throughout the past weeks. The Wallpaper of the Week section is rife with comments, sometimes useful, mostly controversial, but they are monitored for good ideas.
* Last week, we spotted a comment about doing film-themed sections, on occasion. Taking our reader’s comment to heart, this week a small pack of Breaking Bad wallpapers is posted. Although the series came to a close, it continues to make waves and is quickly developing a “classic” designation. To show your Breaking Bad enthusiasm, download some digital goodies…
* Whether you are a Walter White or Jessie fan, there are plenty of choices below for your iOS device. Stay away from the Blue.
