* No more guessing about what the name of the new iPhone is. Steve Jobs just announced the new iPhone, called iPhone 4.
* When Steve Jobs revealed the name and what it looks like and said “stop me if you’ve already seen this”, a nice little joke relating to Gizmodo leaking this last month.
* The WWDC is still going on. Check the blog back in a few minutes for more info about the iPhone 4.
