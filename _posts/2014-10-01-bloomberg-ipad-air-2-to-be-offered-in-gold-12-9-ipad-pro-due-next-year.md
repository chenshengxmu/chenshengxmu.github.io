* Apple’s second-generation iPad Air will be offered in Gold, in addition to Space Gray and Silver colorways, according to a Bloomberg report Wednesday corroborating earlier rumors. Adding a gold color option is one way to “goose sales,” according to people familiar with the plans.
* The iPad Air 2 should be unveiled at a media event expected sometime in October. Bloomberg’s sources with knowledge of the situation have also added that a rumored ‘iPad Pro’ with a 12.9-inch display “won’t be introduced until next year”.
* The iPad Air 2 is said to feature a slightly thinner design than its predecessor, incorporate Touch ID, NFC with Apple Pay and run Apple’s in-house designed A8 chip which debuted on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* At any rate, offering upcoming iPads in Space Gray, Silver and Gold would bring the Apple tablet in line with the existing iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which are offered in same color options.
* That being said, I’m not entirely convinced that Gold would look appealing on a full-size 9.7-inch tablet, though I could be wrong. In years past, I used to buy my devices in white, because white is elegant.

* The release of the iPhone 5s has prompted me to change my mind: now I’m in love with Space Gray. Another reason to go Space Gray: it’s only offered on devices with a black front, making them look more seamless and attractive.
* I can’t really imagine buying a new iPhone or iPad in any color other than Space Gray. Not only are Silver and Gold options overused, having a white faceplate also distracts from enjoying my media, unlike the Space Gray backplate + black front combo.
* By the way, the Apple Watch will be offered in an 18-karat gold edition.
