title: Dev Team Shows Off SHAtter Exploit [GreenPois0n iPhone Jailbreak on Its Way]
---
* Folks, we just got one step closer to an official release of the iOS 4.1 jailbreak promised by the Chronic Dev Team thanks to the SHAtter exploit discovered by pod2g.
* In a video posted on their blog today, the Dev Team showed off an iPod Touch 4G jailbroken with PwnageTool. The Dev Team was able to use the SHAtter exploit to install a custom firmware on the iPod Touch 4G, and was successful in getting the basics covered, such as Cydia, customized preferences, root access, etc…
* Although PwnageTool was a useful first test of a full iPod 4G jailbreak via SHAtter, it’s really overkill compared to the faster tools being developed. Its main use in PwnageTool will be for those with iPhone4’s, to allow updates while preserving the baseband and ultrasn0w carrier unlock.
* This sounds really reassuring. I believe we should see GreenPois0n and PwnageTool released in the next couple of weeks. I know I will be using PwnageTool as I need to preserve my baseband so I can unlock my iPhone.
* If you don’t need to unlock, I believe GreenPois0n will be a faster and easier tool to use to jailbreak your iPhone. At any rates, like the Dev Team said, this is another exciting time for iPhone users.
* Did that get you excited?
