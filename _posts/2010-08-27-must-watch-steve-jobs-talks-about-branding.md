title: Must Watch- Steve Jobs Talks About Branding
---
* I think this is a must-watch video of Steve Jobs talking about branding and where Apple should stand. I’m not sure when this video was recorded, but I’m glad Steve didn’t do about speech about clothing. I mean look at these shorts, man, that’s wild! At any rates, this is the essence of Apple.
