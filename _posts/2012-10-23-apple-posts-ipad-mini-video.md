* During its iPad mini event today, Apple introduced a new accessory: the iPad mini Smart Cover. It’s essentially the same thing as the larger version, except there’s no more metal hinge.
* Alongside the announcement, Apple also showed off a rather well done TV commercial starring the new Covers. And a few moments ago, they published the spot to YouTube…

* As we reported earlier, the iPad mini Smart Cover will come in 6 different colors: Blue, Green, Pink, Grey, Black, and (Product) Red. And it looks like it’s polyurethane or nothing (no leather).
* The Smart Cover will retail for $39, and it should be available for pre-order this Friday along with the iPad mini.
* What do you think of the ad?
