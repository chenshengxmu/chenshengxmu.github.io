* Great news for all of you iOS gamers out there, Firemonkeys has just taken the lid off of Real Racing 3. The title is one of the most popular racing franchises, if not franchises in general, in the App Store.
* This will be the first game out of the new mobile development studio, which is made up of Firemint and Iron Monkey staff — two independent studios that were recently acquired by Electronic Arts…
* Alongside the announcement, Firemonkeys showed off a trailer of Real Racing 3 and its amazing console-like graphics.
* On top of the upgraded graphics, Real Racing 3 will feature several other positive changes, including the addition of real race tracks, and real cars. Porsche, Audi and Dodge are already on board.
* As you may recall, Firemint has kept the Real Racing franchise on the cutting edge of iOS gaming technology. It was one of the first games to support 1080p output, as well as multiplayer AirPlay Mirroring.
* Needless to say, this will be one of the most highly-anticpated iOS titles of the year, as soon as a release date gets announced. All we know so far is that it’s expected to land sometime this fall.
* So, who’s excited?
