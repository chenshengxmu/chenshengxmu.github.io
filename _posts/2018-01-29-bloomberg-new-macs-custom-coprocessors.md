* Apple’s engineers are apparently busy developing as many as three new Mac computer models that would reportedly feature in-house designed coprocessors not unlike the custom “T1” and “T2” chips used in the company’s latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro models.
* Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said Monday that the Cupertino giant is working on “at least three updated Mac models” with custom coprocessors, slated for release “as soon as this year.”
* The new machines include refreshed notebooks and a new desktop computer, according to a person familiar with the plan. A new desktop is likely a radically redesigned, modular Mac Pro machine that Apple last year said was in the works without saying when it might arrive.
* As for the updated notebooks mentioned in Bloomberg’s store, smart money is on a next-generation MacBook Pro model and possibly a brand new 13-inch MacBook laptop that could replace the aging MacBook Air family in Apple’s notebook lineup.

* “Apple watchers believe it’s just a matter of time before the company designs the entire CPU, at which point Intel would lose its fifth-largest customer,” reads the article.
* So far, the only two Mac product lines that include custom Apple coprocessors are the redesigned MacBook Pro notebook with Touch Bar and the new iMac Pro all-in-one desktop.
* The report also mentioned a new iPad model, due later this year, that would include Apple-designed graphics and an artificial intelligence chip, firsts for the iPad line.
* “The new iPad, due to be released toward the end of the year, will probably also include the Apple-designed graphics engine and AI chip,” the author wrote.
* Are you looking forward to Mac refreshes this year?
* Let us know in the comments!
