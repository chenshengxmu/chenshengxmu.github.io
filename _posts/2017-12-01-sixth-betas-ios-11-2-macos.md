* Apple on Friday released the sixth betas of iOS 11.2 and macOS 10.13.2. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* iOS 11.2 features support for Apple Pay Cash and SiriKit for HomePod (which has been delayed until next year), and a number of smaller tweaks. This includes new iPhone X Live wallpapers, support for faster wireless charging, and refreshed emoji. Check out our hands on video with beta 5.

* macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 appears to be largely a maintenance release as well, with few notable user-facing changes. One small tiny change worth noting is that this update brings support for Apple’s new introductory pricing option for developers of subscription apps.
* We’re currently installing today’s betas, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
