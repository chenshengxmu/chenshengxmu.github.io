* Microsoft’s decided that a major Snapchat-style redesign for Skype, released a year ago, was perhaps too much for users so it’s removed the Stories-like Highlights feature from the app.
* Users will be able download all the Highlights they’ve posted until September 30, 2018.
* With Highlights, Skype users could share photo or video slideshows decorated with emojis and text that would automatically disappear after seven days, as opposed to the usual 24-hour window. Anyone who follows you on Skype could view your Highlights or send their own Highlights to specific groups or user.
* But now, more than a year later, Skype has determined that Highlights isn’t something that would “resonate with a majority of users” because it “overcomplicated” things, the company wrote in a blog post this past weekend.
* Here’s Skype’s promo video showcasing Highlights from a year ago.
* Here’s what the team wrote:
* This past year we explored some design changes and heard from customers that we overcomplicated some of our core scenarios. Calling became harder to execute and Highlights didn’t resonate with a majority of users. We needed to take a step back and simplify.
* Focusing on simplicity means simplifying navigation for Skype users by removing redundant and underused features that create clutter, as well as the more decorative elements like alerts with a squiggle shape cut out. Aside from Light and Dark themes, they brought back the classic blue theme adjusted for contrast and readability.
* The core experiences around calling, chat and contacts have been improved, too.
* Skype for iPhone and iPad now has three tabs at the bottom— Chats, Calls and Contacts—while the pair of tabs dedicated to Highlights and Capture have been removed.

* On desktop, as evidenced by the screenshot right above, buttons for Chats, Calls, Contacts and Notifications have moved to the top-left of the window, bringing back some of the simplicity that long-time Skype users are familiar with.
* Skype’s data suggests Contacts isn’t a highly used entry point for most Skype customers. The removal of Highlights should help emphasize Contacts on both mobile and desktop Skype.
* “Those who do use Contacts find it a ‘critical’ and ‘safety’ mechanism to find people they may have otherwise forgotten in a long list of contacts,” says the company.
* Skype’s apps for iPhone, iPad and Mac are available free.
