* Apple on Wednesday seeded what appears to be a small update for the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta. The release comes just two days after the first 10.12.2 beta, and there’s just a tiny difference in the build numbers (16C32f vs 16C32e), so we’re guessing it just contains minor bug fixes.
* Earlier this week Apple released new betas for upcoming updates for all four of its platforms, including iOS, watchOS, tvOS and of course macOS. The first iOS 10.2 beta revealed new emoji and other user-facing changes, but the others seem more along the lines of maintenance updates.
* If you have the first 10.12.2 beta, you won’t need to update to today’s release—in fact, it doesn’t look like you can—but new beta installers will get it by default.
