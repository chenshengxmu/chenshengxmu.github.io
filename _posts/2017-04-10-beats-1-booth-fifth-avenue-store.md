* As part of ongoing renovations, Apple’s flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan will feature a dedicated broadcasting booth for the company’s Beats 1 Radio station, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke with MacRumors. It will be a “very unique area” for broadcasting Beats 1, said the source.
* It’s unclear if the rumored booth will feature one of the existing Beats 1 anchors.
* For context, Beats 1 Radio currently broadcasts out of Los Angeles, New York City and London. New York City anchor Ebro Darden, who appears to broadcast from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, may broadcast his Beats 1 Radio show in front of a live audience visiting Apple’s flagship store.
* The Fifth Avenue outlet has been closed for renovations since January 20. When finished, the revamped store will feature Apple’s next-generation retail layout and over twice as much square footage as before.
* Apple’s Vice President of Apps and Content, Robert Kondrk, and Apple Music’s content boss, Larry Jackson, told The Verge last month that Beats 1 is the biggest radio station in the world. Drake’s latest project, for example, was streamed 89.9 million times in just 24 hours of being available on Apple Music.
* “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period,” Jackson said.
