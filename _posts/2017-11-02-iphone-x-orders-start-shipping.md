* With just hours left until its arrival, first iPhone X orders have now begun shipping to customers as delivery estimates continue to improve ahead of the scheduled November 3 launch.
* Apple started accepting preorders for the anticipated device last Friday, with the status of some early orders quickly changing to “preparing for shipment/dispatch”. MacRumors reported today that most orders have now been updated with a “shipped” status.
* Additionally, some customers who were previously quoted a November 17-24 delivery estimate are now expected to receive their iPhone X around November 8.
* “Many of these customers, but not all, are enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program and ordered a silver model,” notes MacRumors. However, shipping estimates for new iPhone X orders are currently around 5-6 weeks across most Apple Online Stores.

* Because it’s already Friday in Australia and New Zealand, long queues have started forming at Apple Stores across the Asia-Pacific region. For instance, huge crowds gathered outside Apple’s store in Orchard Road ahead in Singapore, reports Channel News Asia.
* Thousands of Australians are also expected to queue around Apple’s retail stores and carrier outlets this morning following record-breaking preorders for iPhone X, reports News.com.au.
* Apple has said that its stores will have iPhone X available for walk-in customers tomorrow, but advised shoppers to arrive early.
