* Instagram today unveiled a new way to organize your saved posts into private collections that only you can see, building upon the ability to save posts for later which launched on the Instagram app back in December 2016.
* “Whether you want to plan your next day trip, revisit your favorite artists’ illustrations or always have some animal videos on hand, collections can help you keep track of the posts you want to remember,” said the company.
* Your collections of saved posts are available via the Saved Posts tab on your profile.
* To add a saved post to a collection, simply hold the bookmark icon underneath the post. You’ll be asked whether you’d like to add the post to one of your previously created collections or create and name a new collection.

* To create a collection out of your existing saved posts, go to the Saved Posts section on your profile and tap the plus icon in the top-right corner, then name your collection and select the saved posts you’d like to add.

* Again, your saved posts and collections are private so your followers won’t be able to see them when they browse your profile. Since launching Save Posts in December 2016, nearly half of Instagrammers have saved at least one post, or 46 percent.
* To learn more about Collections, check out Instagram’s Help Center.
* The ability to organize saved posts into collections requires Instagram version 10.16.
* Instagram for iOS is available at no charge on App Store.
