* Some of the most popular types of wallpapers for iOS are space-themed. Thanks to Apple’s love of the galaxy, we’ve come to really enjoy the beauty of intergalactic images on our Home screen.
* WLPPR is a wallpaper app that collects satellite images not only of space, but also from space. It provides weekly updated images that you can capture and set as your wallpaper.
* The app includes the Original package, which currently has 58 wallpapers in it, feature images taken of earth, from space. You can add the gentle ripples of the Yellow Sea or the golden curves of the clay and soil sands of Iran. Get a satellite view of Texas from space, or see the swirling clouds of the Von Karman vortices from above.
* With a post to Facebook, you can add the Mars package, which features satellite images of the Milky Way’s Red Planet. Whether you are picturing yourself traversing Mars’ South Pole or researching ice layers in the Inca City, you can make one of 31 wallpapers (and counting) part of your iOS experience.

* Additional packages include False Colors, which shows strange phenomenon as viewed from space, and Mankind, which are satellite images of islands that have been inhabited by humankind, can be purchased for $0.99 each. Or, for $3.99, you can unlock all collections, which covers all future content. Currently, the developer is working on a new package called Lifeless, which looks like it will focus on images of the moon.
* Each image has additional information about it. So, if you are wondering when the picture of the Ubinas Volcano was taken, tap on it and then tap the info icon in the lower left corner.
* As you are browsing through the massive number of images, bookmark your favorites. You can then go straight to the favorite section to make your decision a bit easier.
