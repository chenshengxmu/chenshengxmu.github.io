* The iPhone X’s OLED display and ‘notch’ paved the way for Apple to get creative with incoming notification alerts. But as usual, Apple didn’t go all out; incoming notifications look just about the same on the iPhone X as they do on any other iOS handset.
* But a new jailbreak tweak dubbed Notchifications by iOS developer c1d3r can change that, as it compliments your iPhone X’s notch and OLED display combo with a bevy of attractive new notification animations that are sure to catch your eye.
* In the screenshots above, you can see an example of how Notchifications transforms the iPhone X’s incoming notification experience. In particular, the tweak causes unique patterns to appear around the border of the screen, especially near the notch, with an optional blacked-out display.
* Screenshots don’t do any justice for depicting Notchification’s beautiful notification animations, so we’ve embedded a YouTube video from the developer below that shows off some of the tweak’s best incoming notification animations:

* As it would seem, some of the animations color themselves based on the dominant color from the respective application icon. But the fun doesn’t stop there…
* Notchification adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a handy Respring button at the top right of the navigation bar, allowing you to save any changes you make to the preference pane.
* If you happen to have a jailbroken iPhone X, then Notchification just might be worth checking out. It’s available as a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository initially, but requires a $2.00 payment in the tweak’s preference pane for activation afterward.
* Note: Notchification works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices, but looks and works best on the iPhone X’s OLED display.
