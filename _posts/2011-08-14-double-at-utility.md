* And the onslaught of jailbreak utilities continues, with this new release from iSam. The package will allow you to automatically insert your email address into a text field upon double tapping the “@” key.
* While you could accomplish this with an app like Xpandr, Double At is much more simple. This utility is for power users who are constantly sending out their email address from their iDevice…
* I guess it doesn’t have to be your email address. Double At allows you to program the text from the Settings application, so you can pretty much put anything you want. Once it’s set, you can insert it into any text field by — as the title suggests — double-tapping the “@” key.
* If you already have Xpandr, obviously you won’t need to pick this one up. But if you’ve been looking for a condensed alternative, check out Double At. It’s available for free from Cydia.
* Have you tried Double At?
