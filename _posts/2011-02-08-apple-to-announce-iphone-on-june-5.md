* Will Apple announce the iPhone 5 – or whatever its name will be – on June 5? That’s what this screenshot taken from the Moscone Center website reveals with the usual “Corporate Meeting” placeholder. Historically, Apple has always held its iPhone announcement in early June, so there is no reason for that to change.
* The only oddity is that the event supposedly would start on a Sunday, whereas iPhone announcements happened on Mondays in the past…
* At this time, it might still be a little early to tell but it seems very reasonable to believe that Apple will announce the next iPhone on these dates.
* Any thoughts on that?
