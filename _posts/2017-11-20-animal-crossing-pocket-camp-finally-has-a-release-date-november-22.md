* Nintendo’s forthcoming iOS game Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp that was previewed a month ago finally has a release date. It will be coming to mobile devices worldwide on November 22nd.
* This will be the third movie game from Nintendo, after the release of Super Mario Run, and Fire Emblem Heros.
* Unlike Super Mario Run, Animal Crossing will be a free-to-play game.
* The upcoming title has been made available for quite a while now as a soft launch.
* We took a look at what you can expect in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp after Nintendo gave an early look at the game, last month.
* As a refresher, the camping-themed simulator allows people to collect, craft, and design their own personal campsite, as well as visit their friends. There are the usual time-barriers seen in freemium titles, such as the time it takes to craft items. All of which can be sped up via premium currency, available through micro transactions.
* Are you looking forward to Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp? Do you like the free-to-play model they’ve adopted, or would you rather it take the Super Mario Run approach, and unlock most features via a one-time purchase? Let us know below!
