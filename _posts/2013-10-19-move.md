* Move: A Brain Shifting Puzzle Game is another in a long line of new and fun puzzle games that will seriously reduce your work productivity. We’re talking March Madness levels of laziness…
* Move is a simple, yet complex puzzle game that requires players to move various pieces on the board to their respective colors. The only problem is that all pieces move at the same time unless they are blocked. Getting all of the pieces in place is much harder than you’d think.
* To move the pieces, swipe up, down, left or right. All of the pieces will move at the same time, unless there is something in the way. That “something” may be a gray block, or another game piece. Until the piece is clear of the obstacle, it won’t move in that direction.

* The goal is to get each different colored piece on its own colored square. To accomplish that goal, players move all three pieces up, down, left, and right at the same time. Sometimes, you must line up pieces so that they are intentionally blocked by other pieces or by a gray obstacle. Other times, you will need to move all pieces in the same direction multiple times in order to get one piece into the correct spot to match up with its color.
* If you get stuck, you can use a hint. The game starts with 20 free hints, but once you run out, you can purchase a 10-pack of hints for $0.99. When you use a hint, the pieces will move one spot on the board, getting you closer to solving the puzzle. You can use as many hints in one puzzle as you need.

* Each puzzle has a maximum number of moves that you can make before having to restart. However, each level also gives three stars for solving the puzzle with the minimum number of moves. The more complex the puzzle, the more number of moves are allowed.
* There are 1,200 different puzzles, ranging from simple to challenging. There are three different board sizes and five different colored pieces, giving you a huge variety.
* The game comes with 300 puzzles for free. You can download packs of 100 additional puzzles for $0.99 each.
