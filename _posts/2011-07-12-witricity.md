* A few days ago, we mentioned that The Wall Street Journal and other publications were noting that Apple was working on a new way to charge iDevices. From the details, it sounded like some form of inductive method, similar to Palm’s Touchstone charger.
* However, MacRumors has discovered something interesting in a recently-revealed patent application that suggests the Cupertino company might be going a different route. Have you ever heard of WiTricity? 
* WiTricity was founded in 2007, and has made some significant advances in wireless electricity. The technology is based on MIT lab research in which scientists showed a new method of transferring huge amounts of power wirelessly, over small distances.
* WiTricity is said to be safe, utilizing magnetic fields for energy transfer, instead of radiative. The technology is also scalable, so it can handle anything from powering a mouse or keyboard, to recharging an electric vehicle. Check out the video to see it in action.
* When the company demoed WiTricity at the 2009 TED (Technology Entertainment Design) conference, it caught the attention of several companies- including Apple. Remember the “Wireless power utilization in a local computing environment” patent we told you about a few weeks ago?
* Apparently, the filing details a similar technology for a wireless charging method. The Apple patent even refers to the original paper published by the MIT researchers. Could this be the new way Apple plans to charge its gadgets? Maybe.
* Recent rumors suggest that Steve Jobs and company could introduce a new iDevice charging method as early as next year. I for one wouldn’t mind seeing this kind of wireless charging method imbedded into future Apple products.
* What about you?
