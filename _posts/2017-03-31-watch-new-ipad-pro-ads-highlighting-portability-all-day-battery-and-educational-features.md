* Yesterday, Apple expanded its collection of iPad Pro ads based on real tweets from real people with a trio of new videos running fifteen seconds long each. The commercials highlight the device’s light weight, portability, all-day battery life and the many advantages it brings to students in school. Using the “Real problems… answered” tagline, the clips can be streamed from Apple’s official YouTube channel.

* A new commercial for Apple Watch Series 2 appeared this morning, too.
* Running 74 seconds long, it encourages would-be Apple Watch owners to “live bright” by highlighting some of the best features of the wrist-worn device, including built-in GPS for untethered fitness tracking, water resistance up to 50 meters, a dual-core S2 chip, the meditation reminders of Breathe and a 2x brighter screen than before.
