* Following developer betas from two days ago, Apple on Wednesday released public betas of iOS 11.2 and tvOS 11.2 to the members of its Apple Beta Software Program.
* If you’re enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program and your device has an appropriate beta configuration profile installed, you can download the iOS 11.2 public beta to your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch using the Software Update mechanism in Settings.

* Aside from fixing the Calculator bug and solving the boot logo flickering issue, iOS 11.2 lays the groundwork for the upcoming AirPlay 2 support. Moreover, users of older iPhones can now pretty up their Lock and Home screens with Apple’s marketing wallpapers that were previously limited to iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.

* A new Control Center feature lets you view multiple audio sources in the Now Playing widget, which lets you see what’s playing on your iPhone and your Apple TV directly on the phone. Tapping on either card lets you jump between the controls.
* iOS 11.2 also includes support for SiriKit for HomePod.
* tvOS 11.2 solves one of the biggest complaints regarding the new Apple TV 4K where the device would automatically upconvert any video to the currently chosen video output mode, which didn’t always yield good results in terms of image quality and color accuracy.
* Now users can elect to have their Apple TV 4K automatically switch the output format of the video based on currently played content. In the Audio and Video section of tvOS 11.2’s Settings app, users can set the matching frame rate and dynamic range behavior independently of each other.
