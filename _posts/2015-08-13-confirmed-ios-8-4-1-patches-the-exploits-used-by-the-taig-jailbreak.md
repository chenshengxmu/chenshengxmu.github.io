* We were hopeful, but as suspected, Apple was just a little late in getting the security details about the iOS 8.4.1 release out to the public. As it turns out, iOS 8.4.1 does indeed patch the TaiG jailbreak, as rumored for the last month. Needless to say, you should stay away from iOS 8.4.1 if you’re at all interested in jailbreaking your iPhone or iPad.
* Here are the security notes related to the exploits used by TaiG:
* CVE-2015-5746 : evad3rs, TaiG Jailbreak Team

* CVE-2015-3802 : TaiG Jailbreak Team
* CVE-2015-3805 : TaiG Jailbreak Team
