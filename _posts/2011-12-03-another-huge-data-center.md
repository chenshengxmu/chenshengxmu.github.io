* Apple’s demand for computing power and remote server space is growing at a rapid rate thanks to new services like iCloud, iTunes Match, and Siri.
* Demand is growing so fast, in fact, that it appears that its new $1 billion dollar data center in North Carolina and its recently-acquired 12 petabytes of server space aren’t enough to support Apple’s cloud division anymore…
* Oregon Live is reporting that Apple is eying 160-acres worth of land in Prineville, Oregon, a small city that sits about 150 miles southeast of Portland, to build a new data center.
* “The world’s largest tech company is nearing a decision on whether to build a large data center in Prineville, a quarter mile south of the Facebook server farm that opened earlier this year, according to two people with direct knowledge of Apple’s plans.”
* As the article points out, there aren’t many incentives for a city to host large data centers. They don’t bring about many job opportunities, and eat fairly large amounts of electricity. Apple estimates its data center would need around 31-megawatts of power, which is enough to power nearly 22,000 houses.
* But the company’s land ownership and large building would mean Prineville would see a significant boost in tax collections. And the data center would provide a few hundred short-term jobs during its construction. So, there certainly are some upsides.
* According to the source, Apple has until the end of the month to decide whether or not it wants to proceed and purchase the land.
