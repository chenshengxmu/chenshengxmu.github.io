* Carrier Verizon Wireless Thursday morning announced another wave of expansion, bringing its fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network to 29 more markets in the United States, including Selma, Alabama; Clarksburg, West Virginia; and Port Angeles, Washington.
* With the addition of these 29 cities, Verizon’s LTE is now available in 470 markets to more than 250 million people in the United States…
* The list of the 29 new cities getting Verizon’s LTE:
* • Flagstaff and Williams, AZ • Casa Grande, AZ • Prescott and Prescott Valley, AZ • Saddlebrook, AZ • Payson, AZ • Ruidoso, AZ • Mayer, AZ • Sedona and the Village of Oak Creek, AZ • Cottonwood, AZ • Lamar, CO • LaJunta, CO • Oskaloosa, Iowa • Mason City and Charles City, Iowa • Marshalltown, Iowa • Hastings, Neb • Kearney, Neb • McCook, Neb • Farmington, NM • Gallup, NM • Prewitt, NM • Klamath Falls, OR • Roseburg, OR • Sutherlin, OR • Price, UT • Richfield, UT • Clarksburg, West Virginia • Kennewick, WA • Pasco, WA • Richland, WA • Port Angeles, WA • Sequim, WA • Port Townsend, WA
* 4G LTE is supported across latest iOS devices, including the iPhone 5 and cellular versions of both the iPad mini and its bigger brother.
* The company cites a RootMetrics survey of network strength, reliability and speed across each of the wireless carriers which ranks Verizon’s LTE as outperforming competitors “in a large majority of markets tested”.
* Consumer Reports ranks Verizon as the nation’s top carrier in terms of voice and data service quality. In terms of 4G, however, Consumer Reports says AT&T leads the pack even though Verizon has the most robust 4G network.
* According to a media release, Verizon is also expanding its LTE service in 36 existing markets, claiming it is now available to more than 250 million people in the United States.
* AT&T earlier this week rolled out LTE in Green Bay, Springfield, Tucson, Melbourne and Oxford and is now covering 125 metropolitan markets with the high-speed data service.
* Sprint, which just completed its acquisition of Clearwire, is looking to have its LTE network up and running in 31 cities by mid-2013.
