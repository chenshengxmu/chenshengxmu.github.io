* If you’ve been paying attention to the jailbreak scene recently, then you may have noticed Electra Team member CoolStar recommending that Electra1131 users install the tvOS beta profile on their jailbroken iOS device(s) to prevent iOS from nagging you to install software updates.
* Assuming you heeded this advice, you should now have a purple Feedback app on your Home screen for reporting bugs and software issues to Apple. But if you’d rather not have this app, then you can use a new free jailbreak tweak called No Feedback by iOS developer RIshanan to get rid of it.
* Minimalists that absolutely loathe unnecessary Home screen clutter are the obvious audience for this tweak, especially since the Feedback app can’t be deleted via the stock ‘wiggle’ mode that you’d typically use to delete other apps.
* When you install the tweak, the Feedback app immediately disappears from the Home screen, but it doesn’t impact the beneficial anti-update characteristics that you’d come to expect from installing the tvOS beta profile on your jailbroken handset.
* With no options to configure, No Feedback is a simple tweak that minimalists can and should install for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository to solve a negligible concern. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Have you installed the tvOS profile on your jailbroken handset? And if so, does the Feedback app bother you? Share in the comments section below.
