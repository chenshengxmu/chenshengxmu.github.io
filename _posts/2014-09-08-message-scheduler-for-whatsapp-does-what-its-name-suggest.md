* If you frequently use Whatsapp, you might have noticed that the social messaging app doesn’t allow you to schedule messages to be delivered at a specific time. Message Scheduler for Whatsapp is a jailbreak tweak developed by Mohamed Marbouh that enables this feature on your jailbroken iOS 7 device.
* The tweak allows you to schedules a specific time and date when you want a particular message to be sent to a specific recipient. This can be useful when you want to remind someone of an upcoming event at the right time.
* After installing Message Scheduler for Whatsapp, there are no settings to configure. It’s a total install-and-go affair. Once installed, the first thing you have to do is launch Whatsapp and head to a particular conversation where you want to schedule a message. Now, type in your message and tap on the arrow icon. You’ll notice a new option called “Schedule a message”. Pressing it will allow you to select the date and the time when you want the message to be delivered. You can also long tap on the “Send” button to schedule your message.
* When the scheduled times arrives, you’ll receive a notification confirming whether you want to send the message. It displays the message and lets you choose whether you want to send, edit or cancel the message. Even if your device is locked, you’ll still receive a notification before the message is sent.
* The tweak works perfectly and sends the scheduled messages right on time. The only drawback is that the message will not be sent until you respond to the notification. It’s more of a reminder rather than sending the scheduled messages automatically, but the developer could also add this option in future updates.
* If you wish to give this tweak a try, you can purchase it now for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
