* In November Apple debuted a hardbound photo book chronicling 20 years of product designs. The book is titled “Designed by Apple in California,” and it comes in two sizes: small and large, priced at $199 and $299 respectively.
* Alongside the release, Apple posted a promotional video by the same name on its website featuring voiceover from Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and a sneak peek into their design studio. And now the clip is available on YouTube.
* The video is short—just over 2.5 minutes—but it’s worth watching for the unique footage and Ive’s silky smooth explanation of how his team approaches design. If you’re interested in the book, it’s available exclusively at Apple.
