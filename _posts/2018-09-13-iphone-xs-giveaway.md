* Apple’s new flagship device was unveiled on Wednesday, and although it won’t be available in stores until September 21st, we are already planning on giving one away to one lucky iDB reader, with the support of our friends at iMobie.
* This giveaway is made possible thanks to iMobie, whose name probably rings a bell since we’ve highlighted some of their software on iDB in the past. For those who aren’t familiar with the company, iMobie is known for its iPhone, iPod, and iPad content management tools, as well as its iOS data recovery utilities.
* More specifically, iMobie is the maker of AnyTrans, a piece of software that offers a smarter and simpler solution to transfer, manage and back up your photos, messages, contacts, music, etc. As the new iPhone XS is available, you can make a seamless transition from your old iPhone to the new one. The company also makes PhoneRescue, a desktop tool that makes it easy to securely recover contacts, messages, photos from an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch— even if you haven’t backed it up.
* We thought about various ways to let readers enter to win an iPhone XS, but we came to the conclusion that the easier, the better. For this reason, we will ask you a couple things in order to enter for a chance to win a 64GB iPhone XS.
* 1) Sign up for the iDB daily newsletter, a roundup of every post published on iDB sent at the end of each day. The daily newsletter is the best way to catch up with the most important Apple news and tips, all in one convenient place.
* 2) Second, we’ll ask you to check out AnyTrans and see for yourself how this software can help you smartly and rapidly transfer your valued data and files to your new iPhone. You’re not required to download or buy anything. Just have a look around the website.
* Anyone, of any age, from any location can enter for a chance to win this iPhone Xs.
* A winner will be randomly selected on September 24th, and will be contacted via email. The winner will have 7 days to reply with his full name, address, and color preference for the iPhone XS. If we don’t hear from the winner within 7 days, we’ll randomly select another winner. With the winner’s permission, we will post his or her name as well as a social media link on this page.
* Good luck, everybody!
