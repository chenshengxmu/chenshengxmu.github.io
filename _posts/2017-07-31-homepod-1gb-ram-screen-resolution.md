* The Apple-designed A8 chip powering HomePod, Apple’s $349 Siri-powered wireless speaker launching this December, should come outfitted with one gigabyte of RAM while its built-in LED matrix display at the top should potentially sport a resolution of 272 by 340 pixels.
* Basically, the HomePod screen has the same resolution as the 38mm Apple Watch models.
* That’s according to Avery Magnotti today, who was able to glean interesting information from the HomePod firmware that Apple “accidentally” posted on its servers.
* It’s unclear if developers will be able to take advantage of this built-in display which, at present, is used to display a multicolor waveform when interacting with Siri.

* iOS developer Steven Troughton-Smith, who diligently combed through the HomePod firmware files over the weekend, has discovered that the device runs a full version of iOS with a shell app named “SoundBoard”, as opposed to the “SpringBoard” shell app on iPhone and iPad.
* The device bears the name “AudioAccessory1,1”.
* HomePod may potentially provide other previously unknown features, too.
* As per Steven’s findings, some of them may include stuff like VoiceOver accessibility capabilities, HomePod apps prefixed with “Air” (like the “AirMusic” app) and other tidbits.
* The HomePod firmware holds some curious iPhone 8 secrets as well.
* For instance, HomePod code reaffirms KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s findings that iPhone 8 boasts a 5.15-inch active display area maxing out at 2,436 by 1,125 pixels.
* Combined with a bar at the bottom, that apps may or may not be permitted to use, this makes for a total of 5.8 inches diagonally at 2,800 by 1,242 pixels and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.
* Digging further into the HomePod firmware code, Troughton-Smith said this morning that iPhone 8’s rumored facial recognition feature may be called “Pearl ID”.
* He has additionally discovered some glyphs that seemingly confirm the device’s form factor with a nearly full-screen front face with an edge-to-edge screen, no physical Home button and a notch at the top that will likely include the earpiece and various sensors, like an infrared sensor for facial recognition that should work well in both light and dark-lit environments.
