* On Wednesday, Apple introduced three new iPhones and a fourth-generation Apple Watch. At the same time, it said goodbye to older products, including the last iPhones with a headphone jack. 
* The iPhone lineup now includes the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs, and iPhones Xr, plus the iPhone 8/8 Plus, and iPhone 7/7 Plus. Gone is the 2017 iPhone X, 2016 iPhone SE, and 2015 iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The last two on the list shipped with a headphone jack.
* With the change, the least expensive iPhone is the 32GB iPhone 7 for $449, while the most costly model is the 512GB iPhone Xs Max for $1,449.

* Meanwhile, Apple has quietly killed its Apple Watch Edition lineup. First launched in 2015 with at least one 18-carat gold model going for $17,000, the Apple Watch Edition lineup included just two models in 2017. The Apple Series 3 models were made of ceramic and available in space gray and white for $1,249.
* This year’s Apple Watch Series 4 models all have ceramic and sapphire crystal on the back.
