* Our in-depth tutorial explains the process of sharing your Activity data with friends, family or even a personal trainer.
* But there are times when you may simply want to brag about meeting your daily goal by sharing just your Activity rings or the workout you just finished or an achievement you won rather than go through the whole process of setting up Activity sharing.
* In this brief tutorial, you’ll learn how to quickly share your workout, achievement or Activity rings as a standalone image.
* 1) Launch the Activity app on your iPhone.
* 2) Tap one of the following tabs found alongside the bottom of the screen:
* 3) Now pick a desired Activity or workout data using the date picker, or select a virtual medal in your list of achievements, then tap the Share menu in the upper-right corner.

* For example, to share your achievement as an image via iMessage, choose the Message option. You can also post these images to social media like Twitter and Facebook or send them to third-party apps that have a Share sheet extension.
