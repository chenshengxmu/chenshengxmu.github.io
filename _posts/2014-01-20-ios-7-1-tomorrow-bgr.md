* After seeding the third beta of iOS 7.1 to its registered developers, the company could release another beta as soon as tomorrow, according to BGR. While BGR’s track record is not as stellar as it used to be, the tech blog did accurately predict several iOS 7 betas last summer.
* According to the publication, iOS 7.1 Beta 4 will be out tomorrow as Apple continues to squash bugs and fix the remaining hiccups, including keyboard issues and problems with the Contacts app.
* iOS 7 Beta 4 is also expected to bring more changes to the Phone interface “and other changes,” reads the article…
* BGR also claims that iOS 7.1 Beta 4 (build 11D5127c) is already in the hands of Apple’s carrier partners and could get released to developers soon, possibly tomorrow.
* You’re going to love this:
* We have heard from sources that with iOS 7.1, Apple is working very hard to address some large memory bugs and other issues in iOS 7 that have caused crashes and restarts for a lot of people.
* Yes, addressing that iOS 7 memory footprint and memory leaks would be much welcomed. Stock iOS 7 apps on my iPhone 5s crash at least a dozen times on any given day, especially Safari – and I’m not even jailbroken.
* The article goes on to note that iOS 7.1 will unify iOS 7 better graphically, “with various user interface updates across the entire system and in apps for a more cohesive feel”.

* The website thinks there are “about six planned” iOS builds to be released for testing.
* BGR previously said that iOS 7.1 may not be released until March and accurately predicted that Beta 3 would bring several important bug fixes and some new features.
* iOS 7 Beta 3 includes some visual changes to the Dialer/Phone app, a new-look for the slide-to-power-off interface, confusingly tweaked Shift keys on the virtual keyboard, less vibrant icons for Phone, Messages and FaceTime and other visual tweaks and minor changes.
* It has also added the ability to remove over-the-air installer files from the device.
