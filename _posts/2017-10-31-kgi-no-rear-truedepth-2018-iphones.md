* No iPhones introduced in 2018 will be outfitted with a rear-mounted TrueDepth camera system because Apple and its suppliers are expected to focus on reducing costs and selling prices while implementing other spec upgrades to attract consumers, as per analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
* While all new iPhones should come with a front-facing TrueDepth camera like that on iPhone X, Kuo previously predicted that TrueDepth technology won’t see any major upgrades in 2018 as Apple is at least a year ahead of competition with the current implementation.
* Kuo wrote in today’s research note to clients, obtained by MacRumors, that Apple is aiming to launch new 2018 iPhone models on time with stable shipments.
* We do not expect iPhones released in the second half of 2018 to come with a rear TrueDepth camera and 3D sensing, contrary to market expectations.
* While we agree that a rear TrueDepth camera and 3D sensing can potentially provide more augmented reality applications, we note that Apple needs to quickly resolve two issues if it wants 2018 iPhones to have these features, namely: (1) the development of artificial intelligence and ARKit software and an ecosystem, which takes time; and (2) achieving stable shipments and on-time shipping, which are challenging due to the higher spec requirements of rear TrueDepth camera.
* Earlier this month, the analyst forecast that Apple would ditch Touch ID for Face ID with the 2018 iPhone lineup.
* The revered analyst is now predicting that Apple will expand the iPhone X lineup to provide “more product lines to attract more customers.” Notably, recent rumors have hinted at an upcoming iPhone with a 6.46-inch edge-to-edge display.
* “We believe iPhone X’s integrated advantage of 3D sensing and fullscreen design is ahead of competitors by at least one year; thus there is no need for significant upgrades in 2018,” he wrote in today’s report. The analyst expects total iPhone shipments to rise 10-20 percent year over year to 245-255 million units in 2018.
