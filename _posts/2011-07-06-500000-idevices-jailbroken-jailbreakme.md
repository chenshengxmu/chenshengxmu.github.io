* Talk about a hit! iOS jailbreak developer Chpwn just tweeted that JailbreakMe, which was released about 10 hours ago, has already been used to jailbreak 500,000 devices, including iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Also according to Chpwn, the website www.JailbreakMe.com has seen over 1,000,000 visitors in its short time online since Saffron was released.
* I knew people had been waiting for JailbreakMe 3.0 to be released for a while, but the success of this jailbreak really shatters my expectations, and probably Comex’s as well…
* If you haven’t jailbroken your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch with JailbreakMe yet, make sure to check out our guide. We have a few awesome videos of it too.
