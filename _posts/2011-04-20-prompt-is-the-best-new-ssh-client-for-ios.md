* Prompt is a new, stylish SSH app from Panic. The Panic team has developed several popular applications for the Mac, and now they’ve ventured into the App Store with a new SSH client.
* If you’re a network/developer geek, you’re probably very familiar with SSH (Secure Shell). Prompt is an incredibly well-designed SSH client for all iDevices. If you’ve been looking for the perfect SSH app, Prompt may be the solution…

* Panic’s description,
* “Prompt is a clean, crisp, and cheerful SSH client: it helps you when you need it, and stays out of your way when you don’t. Perfect for system administrators, web developers, movie-style hackers (“Let me just TCP/IP into the UNIX port!”), or any person who needs to connect remotely and type some magic.
* Prompt also has a lot of seriously helpful features, including effortless favorites, customizable special keys, autocomplete, keyfile support, Bluetooth keyboards including special keys, password lock, Bonjour server detection, and more.
* Prompt is also universal: it looks and works great on your iPhone, your iPad, and even your iPod Touch (or, as your Mom calls it, your iTouch.)”
* The first impression of Prompt is polished. The app looks and feels just as elegant as Panic’s other products. If you use SSH regularly, you’ll most likely fall in love with Prompt.

* Like Panic says, Prompt has several key features that make it a compelling SSH client for your iPhone/iPad.
* Prompt remembers all of your server connections so that you don’t have to re-establish a connection each session. It also has wonderful support for customizable key commands (as well as Bluetooth keyboard compatibility). Autocomplete, multiple session connections at once, automatic local server discovery, etc. all make Prompt a compelling app for the SSH scene.
* Prompt is available for $4.99 in the App Store. The app is universal and also works great on the iPad.
* What do you think about Prompt? Do you have a favorite SSH app?
