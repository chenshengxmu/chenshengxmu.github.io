* AT&T is no longer in the business of selling Beats Music subscriptions, reports MacRumors. The site spoke with an employee for the carrier who said he’s been instructed to stop offering the service to customers as a monthly plan add-on.
* Additionally, AT&T has pulled all references to Beats Music from its website, and no longer offers the option to sign up for the service when selecting a new phone plan. Beats Music has also removed “Subcribe with AT&T” from its website.
* While there was no reason given for the sudden changes, it’s not hard to speculate. The move could mean that the Beats Music-AT&T deal is over in wake of Apple’s Beats purchase, or it could have something to do with its rumored rebranding.
* Regardless, the fact that AT&T is no longer peddling Beats Music is significant. The carrier offered an exclusive 90-day trial for the service, and better pricing. A spokesman for AT&T said nothing will change for current Beats Music subscribers.
* If you’re interested, you can still download the Beats Music app for free in the App Store, and redeem your 7-day free trial. Subscription rates for the service run $9.99 per month, or $99 for the year, but reports say Apple is trying to lower them.
