* With the release of RedSn0w 0.9.12.b1, you now have the ability to perform an untethered jailbreak on almost every iOS 5.1.1 compatible device. RedSn0w 0.9.12b1 even works with A5 devices like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and the iPhone 4S.
* The only requirement for A5 devices is that you use the non-DFU method when using RedSn0w. RedSn0w also includes support for the older DFU-based limera1n method as well, but that is for A4 devices and below only. In this particular tutorial, we will showcase how to jailbreak your device using the universal non-DFU method that works with all devices.
* This is the simpler of the two methods included with RedSn0w, and is recommended unless your device happens to contain a lot of media, as noted by the iPhone Dev Team.
* Check inside for the full how-toâ€¦
* Note: I recommend that you start with a clean install on your compatible iOS 5.1.1 device. All devices that run iOS 5.1.1 are compatible with the untethered jailbreak outside of the Apple TV 3. If you want to jailbreak the Apple TV 2, use the latest version Seas0nPass.
* Step 1: Connect your iOS 5.1.1 device to your computer.
* Step 2: Download RedSn0w 0.9.12b1 and run it.
* Step 3: Click jailbreak, and wait patiently until the device restores, then resprings, and the Cydia logo appears on your Home screen.
* Step 4: Run Cydia and let it initialize for the first time. Congratulations your device is now jailbroken untethered on iOS 5.1.1.
* Please be sure to watch the video to see how easy this jailbreak really is. We will follow up shortly with a tutorial that showcases the traditional DFU-mode jailbreak for A4 devices and below.
* In the meantime, tell us, which tool do you prefer when it comes to jailbreaking your device?
