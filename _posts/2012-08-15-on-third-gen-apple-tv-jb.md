* Up to this point, the chances for a third-generation Apple TV jailbreak have looked pretty bleak. In fact, the last we heard, no one was even actively working on it.
* But things may be starting to look up for ATV3 jailbreak hopefuls. Well-known iOS hacker p0sixninja says that the task may not be as unlikely as it once seemed…
* Here are some of p0sixninja’s latest tweets on the topic:
* “If you want your ATV3 jailbroken, I would suggest not updating when the time comes.”
* “Not sure why everyone thinks ATV3 is such a huge challenge. It’s only lacking injection and codesign vulnerabilities.”
* “Looks like I was wrong, the code sign exploit used in Absinthe 2.0 is also still present, just an injection vector needed.”
* Now, we won’t pretend to know what any of this means. But it certainly seems to bode well for the chances of a future ATV3 hack.
* As you would expect, however, there’s no timelines on any of this. So it could be 2013 before we see anything materialize. But hey, at least it doesn’t seem so impossible anymore.
* Obviously, we’ll keep you updated with more details as they surface.
