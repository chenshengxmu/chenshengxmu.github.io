* The new Apple TV 4K has brought back the speedy Gigabit Ethernet port (the previous box uses the slower 10/100 Mbps Ethernet for wired Internet), but it’s lost the handy USB-C port.
* The fourth-generation Apple TV, which is still sold, has the USB-C port.
* Apple primarily uses it for service and support, but enthusiast can take advantage of it to connect their fourth-generation box to a computer and do things such as restore the firmware, take screenshots in Xcode, place an Apple TV in recovery mode and so forth.
* As for the Ethernet port, 4K streaming quality depends on hardware and Internet connection so it makes sense they would upgrade the new box to a faster 1000Mbps Ethernet.
* According to the company, 4K streaming requires 15Mbps speeds so it’s nice knowing you can hook up your Apple TV 4K to a broadband modem via a reliable wired connection knowing its built-in Ethernet port provides enough throughout for smooth 4K streaming.
* Like before, the new box can go online via Wi-Fi 802.11ac with MIMO as well, but Gigabit Ethernet definitely provides a much more reliable connection (if you don’t mind the wire).

* Why do you think Apple might have omitted USB-C from the new box?
