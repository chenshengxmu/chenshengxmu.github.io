* TinyUmbrella, the utility used to save your iOS device’s SHSH blobs for future firmware downgrades, has just been updated to support the recently released iOS 5.1 beta.
* Even though we’ve warned jailbreakers not to update past iOS 5.0, and there’s currently no way to downgrade, it’s always a good idea to have your iDevices’ SHSH blobs on file…
* From TinyUmbrella‘s blog:
* “Before you ask; Yes a solution for the 5.x firmware nonce is being investigated… None of us have a working solution yet though. Hang tight. I have a couple trails and ideas I am trying out for 4.x baseband based restores to avoid 10xx errors. Until then save your signatures as you will never know when they may come in handy…”
* Yes, we know there is no untethered jailbreak available for the iPhone 4S or iOS 5. But we still recommend that you save your blobs. You may end up needing them in the future, and if nothing else, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
* You can grab the latest version of TinyUmbrella from our Downloads page.
