* So you thought the new 4K television you paid ridiculous amounts of money for during Christmas was going to be supported by Apple soon enough? Sorry bud, maybe a couple more years.
* Apple scoopster John Paczkowski of Buzzfeed reports that when Apple’s next-generation Apple TV is released to the market later this year, it will lack 4K video capability, even as the television industry grasps onto the new technology that provides a more detailed and immersive viewing experience.
* Apple is skipping the 4K video support reportedly because of the lack of 4K capable content available for streaming. While Netflix and Amazon have supported 4K for more than a year, there’s not much to watch – leaving 1080p still the go-to. One source put it best to BuzzFeed: “4K is great, but it’s still in its infancy.”
* The report comes after it’s been reported the A8 system-on-chip found inside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is capable of playing 4K content. If Apple used a similar chip in the Apple TV, wouldn’t that be an easy feature to include?
* It’s worth examining that 4K content is expensive to stream. Apple is asking its content partners to handle all of the content streaming for its new web television service. Just spitballing here, but perhaps Apple is just waiting for mass 4K adoption and could someday flip the switch on 4K content if a capable chip was on board.
* It’s been widely reported that Apple’s plans for the television are going from a “hobby”, to a serious product in its lineup. Not only will it have a web television service with multiple content partners, but an App Store and slimmer design, if rumors point to be true.
* Reports have pegged an unveiling of Apple’s new television plans at the World Wide Developers Conference in June, with the new web television service launching in September.
* In its typical fashion, Apple declined to comment “on rumor and speculation.” So just sit tight for a couple more months, will you?
