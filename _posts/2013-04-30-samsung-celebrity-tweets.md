* So this would be kind of embarrassing. All-star Spanish tennis player and Samsung spokesman David Ferrer served up a fault this afternoon during his attempt to send out what looks like a sponsored tweet expressing his love for his new Galaxy S4.
* The problem? Shortly after Ferrer sent out the tweet, several of his 350,000+ Twitter followers noticed something peculiar about his Samsung shout out—it featured the infamous ‘Twitter for iPhone’ notation, effectively killing all of its credibility…
* Here’s a rough translation of the tweet via AppleInsider:
* “Samsung is a sponsor of the Mutua Madrid Open tennis tournament that begins this weekend. Ferrer intended to send out a tweet stating he was very happy with his #GalaxyS4 and that he was “configuring S Health on my new #GalaxyS4 to help with training @SamsungMobile.”
* He neglected to notice that the advertisement was being labeled as “via Twitter from iPhone” because he actually uses an iPhone.”
* Before Ferrer could remove the tweet, the message was picked up by the Spanish Huffington Post, and garnered tons of heckling from his fans. After reposting the message without the iPhone notation, he started to receive replies like “via iPhoneGalaxy4.”
* Interestingly enough, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened—where a celebrity has been caught singing the praise of another device from an iPhone or iPad. It happened with singer Alicia Keys and BlackBerry, and Oprah and her Surface.
* Samsung continues to buoy its marketing efforts for the new Galaxy S4, as it begins arriving in wireless stores around the globe. Reviews of the handset have been pretty lackluster thus far, but that doesn’t seem to be affecting its launch sales numbers.
