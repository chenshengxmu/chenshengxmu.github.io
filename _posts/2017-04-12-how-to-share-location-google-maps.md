* Google recently introduced a location-sharing feature in the mobile Google Maps app that’s somewhat similar in functionality to Apple’s Find My Friends app. On your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Google Maps allows you to share your location with others for up to 72 hours, choose who can see where you are, hide other people’s locations from a map and more.
* In this step-by-step tutorial, you’ll learn how to share your real-time location on Google Maps with friends and family in case you’d like to let them know where you are and when you’ll get there.
* First and foremost, location sharing requires the latest version of the Google Maps app.
* It’s important to remember that the location-sharing feature works in the mobile Google Maps app, but not on desktop. On your computer, you can only see a list of friends when they share their location with you.

* Location sharing requires that Google’s Location History feature be enabled.
* Location History itself requires you to grant the Google Maps app continuous access to your location so set it to “Always” in Settings → Privacy → Location Services.

Your location can be shared directly with people with a Google Account or via a link with folks without a Google Account.
* 1) Launch the Google Maps app.
* 2) Tap the Menu icon in the app’s top-left corner to display options.

* You can share your location for up to 72 hours before it’s automatically turned off. If you’d like to share your location indefinitely, tap Until your turn this off but don’t forget to toggle this manually if you decide you no longer want others to see where you are.
* 5) Now choose how you’d like your location to be shared:
* I’m going to share my location with a fake Tim Cook account via iMessage.
