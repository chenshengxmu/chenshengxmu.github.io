* Workflow, the automation app Apple acquired last March, has been updated to version 1.7.8 with additional features and enhancements.
* The biggest feature addition is the ability to mask images.
* An all-new Mask Image feature lets users apply a mask to an image in nearly any shape they’d like, which would often be a task relegated to a photo editing app. By default, users can mask an image with a rounded rectangle (with an adjustable corner radius), ellipse and an icon.
* The Add Things To-Do feature has been enhanced as well, and is now using the Things automation integration that was added in the last Workflow update.
* Here is the full changelog as found on Workflow’s website.
* Since Apple acquired Workflow last year they’ve made the application free to download and have added several new features through updates.
* You can download Workflow for free on App Store.
