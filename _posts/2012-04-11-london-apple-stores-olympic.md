* Apple’s retail stores in London are gearing up for the Olympics as the company is reportedly stocking them with iOS gadgets, as well as international replacement MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and MacBook keyboards.
* According to sources, the company is expecting an “onslaught” of journalists and international Olympic visitors and wants to bank on on a foot traffic increase.
* We’re talking an expected extra 325,000 daily visitors to London for the games, in addition to 10,000 print journalists alone.
* According to a source who spoke to TUAW:
* London is going to be overrun by an onslaught of journalists when the games begin. We want to be prepared should they need help with their equipment during the time they are here.
* The 2012 Olympics will take place in London beginning July 27.
* The timing could coincide nicely with likely upcoming product refreshes at WWDC 2012.
* Apple is believed to be introducing a sixth-generation iPhone at WWDC, an annual developer conference that usually takes place in San Francisco in June or July.
* San Francisco’s Moscone West online calendar shows a corporate meeting scheduled between June 11-15, a likely WWDC 2012 date.
* While the iPhone could be introduced at the event, it probably won’t launch until Fall, a year following the iPhone 4S’s debut on October 5, 2011, which was the first to break Apple’s usual summer iPhone launch pattern.
