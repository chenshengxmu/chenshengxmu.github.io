* To install an app on the Apple Watch, you’ll need to install the app on your iPhone first. Since the Apple Watch is not yet capable of running standalone apps, it’s not possible to install apps on an Apple Watch directly from the watch.
* As you’ll find, there are multiple ways to install apps on Apple Watch, and several things that you’ll need to consider when it comes to installing and managing installed apps. In this post, we’ll break down how to install apps, and some of the idiosyncrasies involved with Apple Watch app installation.
* It’s possible to go to the normal App Store on your iPhone and find apps that feature Apple Watch apps.
* Step 1: Open the App Store on your paired iPhone
* Step 2: When searching for apps, make sure that you see the Offers Apple Watch App notation on the app details. You should also see screenshots of the Apple Watch portion of the app on the details page

* Step 3: Tap the download button to install the app on your iPhone. If you haven’t downloaded the app in the past, the button will say GET (free) or will feature a price for purchase
* Step 4: Once the app is downloaded to your iPhone, it will automatically load and install on your Apple Watch if you have Automatic Downloads enabled
* Any app that you wish to run on the Apple Watch must have an Apple Watch version, but if you go through the Apple Watch companion app, every app listed feature and Apple Watch version.

* Anytime you install an app on your iPhone that features an Apple Watch version, you can opt to have the app installed on your Apple Watch immediately. Here’s how to do it:
* Step 1: Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone
* Step 2: Tap the My Watch tab
* Step 3: Tap General
* Step 4: Tap Automatic Downloads
* Step 5: Enable the Automatically Download Apps switch
* But what if you don’t have automatic downloads enabled, and you wish to install an app on your Apple Watch that’s already on your iPhone?
