* Not so long ago, we told you all about an app for iOS that allowed you to convert PDF files to Microsoft Word files, but did you know you can accomplish the same process on your Mac too?
* In this tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to convert PDF files to Microsoft Word files using an app from the Mac App Store called PDF to Word.
* This process is useful for when you want to be able to actually edit the contents of the file without having to purchase expensive software from Adobe to do so. Buying Adobe Acrobat for your computer can cost up to $450, but if you own Microsoft Word already, and you don’t mind paying a few extra bucks for an app from the Mac App Store, you’ll be nowhere near that kind of outrageous price tag.
* PDF to Word is available in the Mac App Store as a free download, but you’ll also notice there is a paid version of the app in the Mac App Store for $29.99. The free version can convert up to two pages of a PDF file to a Word file, but the pro version gives you the ability to convert an unlimited amount of pages of a PDF file to a Word file.
* Still, the trade-off seems obvious; buying Microsoft Office and PDF to Word by Feiphone is three times cheaper than buying Adobe Acrobat to edit your PDF files.
* There are a lot of PDF to Word conversion apps available in the Mac App Store, but PDF to Word by Feiphone was one of the only ones that offered both a free trial version and worked as advertised.
* To convert PDF files to Word files with PDF to Word by Feiphone, follow these steps:
* Step 1: Download and install the app from the Mac App Store (free trial) or (pro version $29.99).
* Step 2: Locate a PDF file on your Mac that you wish to convert to a Word file. We’ll be using a 2016 IRS tax form that we had available at the time for this tutorial.
* Step 3: Launch PDF to Word by Feiphone and click on the “Add Files…” button to get started.

* Step 4: In the Finder window that opens next, browse for the PDF file you want to use, and double-click on it.

* Step 5: On the right side of the app, choose the “Output Format,” “Page Range” and “Output Directory.” We’ll be choosing DOCX for the output format, “All Pages” for the page range, and our Downloads folder for the output directory in this tutorial.
* Step 6: With your file selected, click on the green “Convert” button at the bottom right of the app.

* Step 7: The app will do its thing, and should be done with the conversion process pretty quickly. You’ll see a little green check mark and “All Pages, DOCX, Success!” by the file name if all went well.

* Step 8: Verify the DOCX file you just created is in the output folder you designated.

* Step 9: In this case it is, so now verify that the DOCX file opens in Microsoft Word without any problems.

* Step 10: You’ve just converted a PDF file to a Word file – make edits and changes as needed!
* As you have seen, PDF to Word by Feiphone moves all of the formatting, tables, and more from the PDF document to the Word document that you’re creating. For what it is, it does a decent job. It’s not as high of quality as Adobe’s software is, but for what it is – aftermarket software trying to solve a problem in the market – it’ll get the job done.
* The free trial version of the app is not only limited to two pages, but it’s also ad-supported. When you purchase the pro version of the app, you don’t have any ads and you have no page limits.
* If you don’t select your output file type and destination folder before converting PDF files to Word files, you may experience problems with compatibility when opening the files in Word and you may even have trouble finding where the file went after the conversion, so please remember to check these parameters before clicking the “Convert” button.
* Once the file is created, you can share it with anyone and as long as they have Microsoft Word or another compatible word processor, they will be able to open the DOCX file you created and make edits to it.
* Someone who gets a lot of PDF files to deal with on a regular basis, such as by email, and needs a way to electronically input information or edit the contents of the PDF file will find this app very useful. If you don’t deal with many PDF files, you’re probably not going to need a PDF to Word converter.
* Mac apps are just about always pricier than iOS apps, and by a significant amount. At $29.99 in the Mac App Store, PDF to Word by Feiphone does the same thing that a $4.99 app for iOS would do, but if you’re serious about your PDF to DOCX conversions, that’s probably not going to matter much to you because you’re going to be more worried about workflow and reliability long term.
