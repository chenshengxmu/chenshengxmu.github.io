* One of the features of the Safari web browser built into your Mac that will come in handy time and time again are the private browsing windows that you can open to browse the web privately without having your browsing history stored in your computer for the next user to see.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to open a private browsing window in Safari on your Mac so that you’re ready the next time you need to perform a web search incognito.
* When you want to perform a web search without the next person to use the computer knowing what you were looking up, such as when you were shopping for the holidays, you might want to use a new private browsing window in Safari to get the job done.
* This feature also comes in handy even if you’re the only user of your computer and you know you’ll be sharing a screen with someone in the future when you go to surf the web. This ensures that your history doesn’t pop up in everyone’s faces and others won’t know what you were looking up in the past.
* When you want to open a new private browsing window in Safari, you must first have an instance of Safari running on your Mac’s desktop. Once open, you’ll follow these simple steps:
* Step 1: Move your mouse to the Menu Bar and click File > New Private Window.

* Step 2: A new window should appear that has a dark colored Smart Search field with white text; if it does, you did it!

* Note: As an alternative to opening the menu from the top of the screen, you can also use the following keyboard shortcut: ⇧⌘N (Shift + Command + N).
* In the event that you don’t feel like doing the above process every time you want to use private browsing mode, and you want to enable a set-it-and-forget-it method of forcing Safari to always open in private browsing mode when it’s opened like you can in iOS, you can also follow these steps:
* Step 1: Launch Safari and go to the Menu Bar and click Safari > Preferences.
* Step 2: If not already in the General tab, open it.
