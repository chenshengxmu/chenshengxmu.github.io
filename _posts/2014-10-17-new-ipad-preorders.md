* Apple’s Online Store went down for more than three hours earlier this morning as the Cupertino firm was gearing up to start accepting pre-orders for the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
* Lo and behold, Apple has now begun accepting pre-orders for the new tablets from customers in 29 countries and territories.
* Additional global availability is due in the coming months. Interestingly enough, U.S. carrier AT&T started accepting pre-orders for the new tablets ahead of Apple. If you’re interested, head over to the Online Apple Store and make your reservation for one of the new iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 models.
* Apple promised to start shipping these “later next week”.
* Estimated delivery times for both new tablets: 2-4 business days.
* To pre-order the iPad Air 2 from Apple, go here.
* The iPad mini 3 pre-orders are available at this link.
* The first wave of pre-orders includes the following countries: The United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (Wi-Fi models only), Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macau (Wi-Fi models only), Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
* Later this month the tablets will hit Croatia, Greece, Puerto Rico, Russia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and other markets around the world, with additional global availability in the coming months.
* In addition to Apple’s own online and retail stores, they’re also selling iPads through AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless in the United State, as well as additional carriers and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* The iPad mini 3 received a disappointingly modest upgrade yesterday in the form of Touch ID and gold colorway and is available for $399/$499/$599 for 16/64/128GB varieties. The device literally shares the same innards as the previous-generation iPad mini 2, which is now a $100 cheaper and starts at $299.
* They’re also keeping the original iPad mini around starting at $249. Note that these prices are for Wi-Fi models so you’ll need to add an extra $130 if you need 4G LTE cellular connectivity.
