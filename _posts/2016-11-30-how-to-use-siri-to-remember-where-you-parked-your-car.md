* Starting with iOS 10, your Maps app can remember where you parked your car. You can configure it to do this automatically, but in circumstances where you don’t have a compatible head unit, this isn’t going to work.
* On the other hand, whether you have a compatible head unit or not, you can alternatively use Siri to remember where you parked your car manually. 
* Like with any Siri command, you can launch Siri by pressing and holding on the Home button, or by saying “Hey Siri” while in hearing distance of a compatible iPhone. Please note that only the iPhone 6s and later support Hey Siri without being tethered to a power source.
* Once you engage Siri, you can say something like, “Hey Siri, remember where I parked my car.” This will make Siri put a car icon in the Maps app where you told her to mark your parking spot.
* As long as the parking location is marked, you can launch the stock Maps app on your iPhone and easily get walking directions to your parked car. This way, you’ll never have that lost look on your face ever again.

* After you’ve found your car, you can invoke Siri once again and say something like, “Hey Siri, forget where I parked my car.” This will cause Siri to erase your current parking location.

* Now, Siri will be free and clear to take another parking command the very next time you need to park your car in a busy parking lot and don’t want to bother with trying to remember where you parked yourself.
