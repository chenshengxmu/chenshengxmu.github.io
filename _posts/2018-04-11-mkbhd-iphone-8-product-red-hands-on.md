* Popular technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee has posted his hands-on video walkthrough of the new iPhone 8 PRODUCT(RED) edition days ahead of its scheduled launch this Friday.
* If you’ve been wondering, the red iPhone tradition started last year with iPhone 7.
* However, many folks took issue with its white faceplate. With the iPhone 8 PRODUCT(RED) models, not only do you get a gorgeous red finish with an all-black face that looks great but the red hue is way more pronounced than on last year’s PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7.
* “It’s really, really red,” Brownlee exclaimed.

* “It’s a different red from last year which was anodized matte red and aluminum finish,” he explained. “This is under glass now as iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are so it’s more like of a Ferrari or ruby or candy red.”
* The only problem with red iPhones is the timing, really.
* If PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models are anything to go by, Apple typically introduces a red finish halfway into a phone’s product cycle, which kind of makes it a tough purchasing decision knowing that a brand new model is just six months away.

* If you’re a fan of Brownlee’s unbiased technology reviews and excellent video walkthroughs, iDownloadBlog has recently partnered with him on the official MKBHD wallpapers so check out those and download them to your devices if you want.
* As for me, all I want is a red iPhone X.
* How about you?
