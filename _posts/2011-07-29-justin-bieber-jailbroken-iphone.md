* We don’t usually post stuff like this on iDB —and we certainly don’t have Bieber fever — but this was too good to pass up. Apparently, Justin Bieber uses a jailbroken iPhone.
* As evidenced in one of his tweets, Justin Bieber uses a jailbreak Twitter extension called qTweeter. With over 11 million Twitter followers, we’re sure Justin is familiar with the best Twitter clients out there.

* There’s really nothing else to say about this, except that we hope Justin reads iDB for all of his jailbreaking needs.
