* This is it. Apple finally unveiled the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c without much surprise to anyone who’s been following the rumors for a while. We’ve already posted about the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c pricing and availability but we thought it’d be worth having a post dedicated to these devices’ prices off-contract.
* So far, looking at Apple’s website, only T-Mobile will be offering unlocked and contract-free iPhones from day one, starting September 20th. If history is any indication of the future, chances are other carriers such as AT&T will later offer the devices without a contact, and unlocked for use on other carriers.
* But let’s have a look at the prices of contract-free iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c…
* As you can tell from the image above, a contract-free iPhone 5s will start at $649 for the 16GB version, and go to $749 and $849 for both the 32GB and 64GB versions respectively. It’s not much of a surprise as it is in line with the discontinued current iPhone 5 prices.
* Now, looking at the iPhone 5c, these prices aren’t really what we expected. Labeled as the “affordable iPhone”, this device actually isn’t barely more affordable than the top of the line iPhone 5s.
* Starting at $549 for the 16GB version, it goes up to $649 for the 32GB version, far above the expected $449 that the press, including us, thought it would be priced at.
* But $100 is $100, and for someone who’s getting a smartphone for the first time, it will sure make the difference. Seasoned smartphone owners – that would be you, iDB readers – will still likely get the iPhone 5s instead.
* What do you think of these prices?
