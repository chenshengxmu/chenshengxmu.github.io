* Among other enhancements, a software update for the fourth-generation Apple TV has brought out podcasts to your living room experience via Apple’s Podcasts app.
* If you have kids and everyone in your household is using the same Apple TV, it might be a good idea to prevent explicit content in Apple Music and Podcasts.
* In this quick tutorial, we’re going to show you how to disable mature language for music and podcasts on the Apple TV by flipping a switch in Settings.
* To disable explicit music and podcasts, we’re going to use the Apple TV’s Restrictions feature, also known as parental controls, which lets parents block or limit certain features and services on the device.
* Step 1: Go to Settings → General → Restrictions.
* Step 2: Select Restrictions to turn the feature on.
* Step 3: When asked, make a four-digit passcode. Enter the passcode again to confirm, then select OK to continue.
* Step 4: Select Clean in Music and Podcasts below the Allowed Content heading.
* Explicit tracks on Apple Music and podcasts in the Podcasts app will no longer be available on your Apple TV. To filter out nothing, select the Explicit option.
