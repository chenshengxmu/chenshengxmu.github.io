* In the game, you can plays as your favorite Jedi Knight or Sith Lord. There are over 120 playable characters to unlock, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and Boba Fett. And there are over 36 story mode levels to finish.
* As far as controls go, you can switch switch between “Classic” and “Touch Screen” controls to find the play-style that suits you best. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any mention of the game supporting the new MFi controllers.
