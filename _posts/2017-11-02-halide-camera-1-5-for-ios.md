* Halide, one of my go-to iPhone camera apps, was refreshed on App Store today bringing not only support for iPhone X, but a wealth of other new photography features as well.
* The app now goes completely edge to edge on iPhone X, even utilizing the infamous “ears”. It also takes advantage of the dual camera depth mode and introduces support for the HEIF image format. The update is free for existing users of the app.
* Developers Ben Sandofsky and Sebastiaan de With say this update was created from the ground up for iPhone X. One of the most intriguing aspects is how they’ve chosen to deal with the iPhone X notch—instead of just displaying content below the left and right “ear”, they’ve opted to utilize that space for useful metrics.

* For instance you can see a histogram in one and the exposure in the other.
* This not only is beneficial to see while shooting, but keeps the viewfinder clear. One-handed operation was also important—all the user interface controls are now within reach of your thumb, making the camera app more accessible than ever before.
* Halide takes advantage of all Apple’s other recent platform improvements, too.

* It now supports Apple’s new HEIF media format implemented in iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra for half-size photos with image quality comparable to the ubiquitous JPEF format.
* It’s gained the ability to capture depth information, which is great for portraiture photography.
* And with the manual focus, you can see the ƒ/2.4 aperture on the telephoto lens on your iPhone X in all its glory. iPhone 8 and iPhone X support hardware-based noise reduction, which is now present in Halide as well.

* We went hands on with Halide when it launched earlier this year and were blown away by the simplicity and thoughtfulness that went into this powerful app.
