* Instagram on Tuesday announced that it’s increasing the time limit on videos from 15 seconds to 60 seconds. The move is part of a broader effort to give users “more fun, flexible and creative ways to create and watch video content” on IG.
* The social network says that within the last 6 months, time users spent watching video increased by more than 40%. And it’s hoping that the increased clip length, along with reenabling multi-clip uploads, will help it continue that growth.
* For iOS, we’re also bringing back the ability to make videos out of multiple clips from your camera roll. To learn more about multi-clip video on iOS, check out the Instagram Help Center.
* Longer video on Instagram begins rolling out today and will be available for everyone in the coming months. Multi-clip video is available this week as part of Instagram for iOS version 7.19 in Apple’s App Store.
* Instagram notes that this is just one of many changes we will be seeing to its service this year. Earlier this month, the company announced it would be changing its feed order from chronological to a method based on posts you want to see most.
* You can download Instagram in the App Store for free.
