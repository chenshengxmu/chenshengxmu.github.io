title: Verizon Follows AT&T's Lead and Starts Blocking Unofficial Tethering

* A couple days ago, we reported that AT&T would automatically start moving jailbreakers using MyWi to an official tethering plan starting August 11.
* It now seems that Verizon is following the same path, as it has started directing users who use unofficial tethering to this page, a kind warning that those users might want to get legit and start paying for the service…
* According to RWW:
* “It appears that Verizon is starting to block hotspot tethering for consumers using jailbroken devices without data plans. A ReadWriteWeb employee using a jailbroken tethered Verizon Motorola X without a data plan was sent to this page outlining Verizon’s hotspot data plans today when trying to access a hotspot.”
* Nothing surprising here. This was bound to happen, but still, it does sound unfair for those who signed up for an unlimited data plan. I guess “unlimited” has its limits, too.
* What do you think? Is it fair?
