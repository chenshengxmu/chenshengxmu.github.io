* Apple’s browser on iOS and OS X includes a nifty content recommendation capability, called Safari Suggestions (not to be confused with suggested search words and phrases).
* The feature activates when you start typing into Safari’s Smart Search field, popping up nicely designed interactive content previews for iTunes media, news, Wikipedia articles, weather forecasts, apps from the App Store, film showtimes, locations nearby and more.
* Sometimes these suggestions are not related to your searches at all, sometimes they slow you down due to background activity and other times you simply might not care about them. You can, thankfully, turn Safari Suggestions off on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac with just a few taps/clicks, here’s how.
* Before we get to it, let me just point out that Safari Suggestions may not be available in all markets.
* “Not all features of Safari Suggestions may be available in all languages or regions and some features of Safari Suggestions may vary by region,” states Apple.
* At the time of this writing, Spotlight Suggestion were available in 19 markets on iOS and in 16 markets on iOS. For the full breakdown of the Spotlight Suggestions-friendly regions, check out Apple’s iOS 9 Feature Availability and OS X Feature Availability webpages.
* Safari Suggestions currently support the following items:
* These content previews may appear after entering a word or phrase in Safari’s Smart Search field.
* For instance, if you enter the search phrase ”weather cupertino” Safari may provide a suggestion in the form of an up-to-date interactive preview containing handy information on the current weather conditions in Cupertino, California.
* Click the preview and Safari opens an appropriate webpage with more information. Many other Safari Suggestions sport these interactive previews, some of which might include  clickable buttons or links to do context-specific cations like sending an email, getting directions, making phone calls, playing song previews and more.
* If Safari Suggestions are enabled on your device, the following non-identifiable data will get sent to Apple when you run a search query in the Smart Search field:
* Your account name, number, password and search results won’t be sent to Apple.
* You can disable Safari Suggestions if you don’t need them or find them a nuisance, which’ll prevent the browser from sending both Safari Suggestions usage data and your search queries to Apple.
* Safari Suggestions can be turned on and off independently of Location Services for the feature. Location Services help Safari suggestions deliver recommendations that are more relevant to your current location.
* More on these data gathering practices can be fond in Apple’s Privacy Policy.
* 1) Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Safari in the Settings list.

* 3) Slide the Safari Suggestions toggle to the OFF position.
* You can now close out the Settings app and switch to Safari to see the changes.
* Tip: If you’d also like to turn on or off suggested search terms in Safari, toggle the Search Engine Suggestions switch.
* 1) Open Safari on your Mac.
* 2) Select Preferences in the Safari menu.
* 3) Click the Search tab.

* 4) Deselect the checkbox next to Include Safari Suggestions.
* Exit out of Safari Preferences, click the Smart Search field and start typing to see your changes.
* As mentioned, Safari Suggestions use Location Services to deliver relevant search suggestions.
* You can opt out of Location Services for Safari Suggestions, but Apple may still use the IP address of your Internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region in order to try to tailor Safari Suggestions to your current location. Note that disabling Location Services for Safari Suggestions also disables them for Spotlight Suggestions.
* 1) Go to Settings → Privacy → Location Services on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad and tap System Services at the very bottom.
* 2) Slide the switch next to Safari & Spotlight Suggestions to the OFF position.

* 1) Launch System Preferences on your Mac.
* 2) Click the Security & Privacy pane.
* 3) Click the padlock icon to unlock the preference pane, enter your Mac administrator account’s name and password and click Unlock to continue.

* And that’s all there’s to it!
* Last but not least, Spotlight Suggestions can be disabled independently of Safari Suggestions in Settings → General → Spotlight Search → Spotlight Suggestions on iOS and under System Preferences → Spotlight → Search Results → Allow Spotlight Suggestions in Spotlight and Look Up on OS X.
