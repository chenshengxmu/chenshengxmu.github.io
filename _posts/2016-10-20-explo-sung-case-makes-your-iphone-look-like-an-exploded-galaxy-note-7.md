* I wish I thought about this: someone’s actually made a case with a decal designed to make your iPhone look like an exploded Galaxy Note 7 from Samsung. Aptly named Explo-Sung iPhone Skin, it’s available for all iPhones from the iPhone 5 onward. The $24.95 case is made by a company called UniqFind which happens to sell a range of skins for Mac notebooks and iOS devices on Amazon.
* “Here at UniqFind, we’ve come up with a merciless way to dress-up your iPhone this Halloween–as a burnt device,” reads the description. “Introducing the Explo-Sung decal for iPhones. It’s our hottest skin yet.”
* If you want even better protection for your iPhone, the Explo-Sung is available in the skin + hard case combo for $34.99. The laser-cut skin was specifically engineered for the iPhone and has a cutout to reveal the Apple logo.
* You can pre-order your Explo-Sung iPhone skin now (it ships in early November).
