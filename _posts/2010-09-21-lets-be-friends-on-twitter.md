* I’ve been thinking about that for a while but for some reason I never got to go ahead with it. I just created a list of iDB readers on Twitter. If you read this blog and if you’re on Twitter, then you should be on the list!
* So far I have only 3 people in this list. That’s because I don’t know your Twitter username. To get on the list, simply ask me to add you on Twitter by sending a tweet such as “@SebastienPage Hey add me to your iDB list”… Doing this will make it easy for me to find you and to easily add you to the list. Writing a comment on this post with your Twitter username will not do it because I won’t check this post again.
* So, come on say hello on Twitter 🙂
* PS: don’t forget to follow this list as well…
* PS 2: Don’t forget to follow me :))
