* Today, developer Tapbots has shared some updates concerning state of development of its popular iOS and Mac Twitter client, Tweetbot, and the whole software lineup for that matter.
* For starters, a completely redesigned Tweetbot 2.0 for Mac with Yosemite-friendly look and feel has been in the works for quite some time now. Tweetbot 4.0 for iOS is being readied as well.
* “We are going to do a better job keeping our current apps up to date with each new OS release,” they promised. In addition, the company announced closing other projects in order to focus resources on upcoming (and long overdue) updates to Tweetbot for Mac and iPad.
* The updated Mac app should be ready before Apple’s annual developers conference, which usually takes place in early June. For those wondering, Tweetbot 2 for Yosemite will be available as a free update for existing users “to show our appreciation for your support in the past few years.”
* The app is coming along “very nicely” and they’re currently working hard to get it into a solid beta state. It’s taken so long because Tweetbot 2 for Mac “has become a huge rewrite and has taken so much longer than we had hoped.”
* Next up, Tweetbot 4.0 for iOS, the next major release of Tweetbot for Apple’s mobile platform. Among other parks, it will have landscape support and a redesigned profile view.

* Furthermore, developers appear to be consolidating separate iPad and iPhone downloads into a single, universal app that will include “the highly anticipated update to the iPad version.”
* The iPad and Mac editions of Tweetbot are ripe for change as both were last updated way back in June of 2014. “We plan on putting a lot of time and love into making Tweetbot a better product this year,” Tapbots assured.
* Lastly, they’ll be giving the smart calculator app Calcbot some love as well, both on the iOS and OS X side of things. “We have some cool ideas for extending the app to the Today view and more,” they teased.

* As part of the focus sharpening on Tweetbot and Calcbot, the team has axed Convertbot and Pastebot — again, due to the lack of time needed to update them in the near future.
* Keep in mind that Convertbot functionality has been folded into Calcbot’s most recent update, now available as a freemium download with a $1.99 Pro upgrade to unlock Convertbot features.

* “Many think updating apps for iOS7/8 is a simple task, but with all the custom UI we have, it requires redoing the app from scratch which is months of work,” they explained. “Those apps are also many years old now and require far more than a visual refresh.”
* Tweetbot for iPhone and iPod touch is $4.99.
* Tweetbot for iPad is a $2.99 download.
* The Mac edition of Tweetbot will set you back $19.99.
* Grab Weightbot free of charge in the App Store.
