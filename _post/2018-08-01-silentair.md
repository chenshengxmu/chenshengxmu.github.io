* AirDrop comes in handy when you want to wirelessly send files from one device to another, but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired, especially when receiving large files.
* The single most significant complaint is that the intrusive AirDrop receiving pop-up appears on the screen for too long, blocking you from doing anything else until the pop-up vanishes. But a new free jailbreak tweak called SilentAir by iOS developer Muirey03 aims to change that.
* SilentAir replaces the clunky stock AirPlay receiving pop-up with a sleeker Status Bar-based progress bar that remains out of your way throughout the file transfer, allowing you to multitask without intrusion.
* The screenshot above shows an example of Silent Air’s Status Bar-based progress bar during AirDrop file receiving. You can compare it to the stock pop-up below:

* Right off the bat, you can see how much less intrusive the new interface is. But the excitement doesn’t end there because SilentAir is fully-customizable.
* SilentAir adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a respring button in the preference pane so that you can save your changes.
* Note: If the color picker isn’t working for you when you try to change colors, make sure you have the libcolorpicker dependency installed in Cydia.
* With the stock AirDrop receiving pop-up being a significant UI oversight on Apple’s part, this tweak provides an adequate solution that looks great and performs just as well.
* If you’re interested in trying SilentAir, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Packix repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
