* In a recent turn of events, two companies released a keychain Lightning charger. You may remember, last week we ran a giveaway for an extremely similar product. However, if you read through the previous post, there were a few things the competition could do better.
* Enter, Kii by Bluelounge. A clever pun, Kii is a keychain charger, which is produced both for Lightning and 30 pin options. This little guy is currently attached to my daily key ring and traveled with me for the past couple weeks. Offering a charge on a moment’s notice, the Kii is the perfect companion not only for travel, but also daily use…
* Giving the Kii a hard look on the design table, Bluelounge got the most important detail correct. Metal. The part of Kii that attaches to the keyring is metal. Additionally, on the opposite end, the USB tip is metal. Having both ends of this device made with a durable material, can make all the difference when it comes to longevity and performance.

* Think about it. Kii is inconspicuously hidden amongst your other keys, cleverly disguised with mimicry. The chances you are always thinking about your emergency charger is minimal. Keys get thrown around everywhere, carelessly tossed in the parking lot, dropped in the rain, clipped to backpacks, swallowed by the dog, did I mention dropped? Kii is going to be put to the test and utilizing metal will be the differing factor against the competition.

* To boot, it looks pretty slick. A short stub, not much longer than a key, the Kii is a great pocket companion. Losing a charge is painful, but Kii is always with you. Due to the short design, it is not recommended for charging in vertically placed USB hubs. Laptops are the best bet or a wall outlet next to a flat surface. Flexibility is minimal because of the rigid connection between the tips, but durability may be higher.
* Getting the cord to detach is simple. On the Lightning model, simply flip a spring loaded switch and pull down. For the 30 pin option, pinch the two sides of Kii and the top will pop off. I have been using the Lightning version and I can attest the locking system is solid. There is no fear the cord will fall out inadvertently.
* The Kii is an innovative product. I really like knowing I have a charging solution with me at all times. The metal accents really bring the design/build to a new level. This alone puts it ahead of the competition, however, being first comes with a cost. The Lightning version is a staggering $39.95, while the 30 pin version is a more reasonable $19.95, both currently available via the Bluelounge webstore.
* To Bluelounge’s credit, Kii is Apple certified and the licensing for MFI dramatically increased with the Lightning technology. This is now a pain, not only for manufacturers, but also for consumers. I do really appreciate the details on the Kii and the locking mechanism, but the price tag makes this product more of a pricey “wish” for most standard consumers.
* What do you think about the Kii? It is a really cool product, but, I’m wondering, who out there will be picking one up?
