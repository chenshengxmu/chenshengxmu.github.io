* If you’ve jailbroken your iPhone 5, iPod touch 5th gen, iPhone 4s, iPad 2, or any other 32-bit iOS device, then perhaps you’ve encountered the problem that this update fixes. The launchd process would “spin” continuously burning CPU and battery, and in some cases, even making the device run extremely hot.
* I’ve seen various reports about iPhone 5s running hot, but never really took them seriously. That probably has something to do with the fact that I’ve only jailbroken 64-bit devices like the iPhone 5s and 6 Plus. But apparently, this was a real issue affecting more than just a few. For that reason, Pangu has issued an updated version of its Untether package to fix the problem.
* Head over Cydia now to find the Untether update. Once you install it, you’ll need to reboot your device.
* Here is the full change log for the update:
* Version 0.3 of this package fixes the issue where, on 32-bit devices (iPod 5, iPhone 4S/5, iPad 2, iPad Mini 1) a specific background process (launchd) would sometimes “spin”, burning CPU and battery, or even heating up.
* Even if you’re running a 64-bit device or haven’t experienced issues on your 32-bit device, it’s still recommended that you update. Be sure to save any work before you update, because as stated, the update does require a reboot.
* Have you experiences any problems with the jailbreak regarding excessive heat? If so, sound off down below with your comments.
* Update: This package has been pulled by Saurik for the following reasons. Quoting Saurik on /r/jailbreak:
* Some users on 64-bit devices are reporting mild to serious issues with this package. According to the Pangu team, they have changed almost nothing on 64-bit, and have not seen the issue themselves in their testing. We have pulled the package anyway, and the people at Pangu are working on doing a more detailed analysis of the issue.
* Looks like those who weren’t able to update will have to wait a while for the fix.
* Update 2: it’s back up now. Have at it and let us know what you find.
