* Sparrow, once only a third-party email client for the Mac, landed on iOS last month with a splash. The $2.99 software provides users with an excellent alternative to the native Mail option.
* Well the app received an update today, bringing it to version 1.1. It includes a handful of new additions and features, and the developers say that more is on the way…
* Today’s update adds the ability to show or hide the app’s notification badge per account, and open links through a built-in web browser. It also now has new actions for emptying the trash, and archiving sent emails.
* But the good news of the day comes via a blog post from the app’s developers. It reads:
* “Thanks to your amazing support, we feel confident that Apple might revise its position on the Push API. We’ll submit a version of Sparrow 1.2 including it. this might delay Sparrow 1.2 validation but we’re already working with some partners to include Push in future versions of Sparrow without needing Apple clearance. Push is coming. With or without Apple.”
* Sparrow’s lack of push notification has been the one glaring omission that a lot of folks have said are keeping them from using the app exclusively. So it would certainly behoove the developers to figure out a solution quickly.
* Either way, Sparrow 1.1 is available today. And it’s certainly worth updating if you already own the app. Otherwise, if you’re holding out for push notifications, it looks like you’ll only have to wait a little while longer.
