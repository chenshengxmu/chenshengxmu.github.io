* Microsoft’s one-week old Surface Pro tablet already has some dings in its reputation. The device is more difficult to repair than Apple’s iPad, according to a teardown by iFixit. The Surface Pro makes extensive use of glue to secure everything, including the battery and display, giving Microsoft’s latest tablet a score of just one out of ten for repairability. And repairs could become common, given simply using the Surface Pro could be harmful to the hardware…
* “Just opening the tablet offers a high probability of completely cutting one of the four cables that surrounds the display,” writes TechCrunch Wednesday.
* At the same time the Surface Pro uses a freaky amount of glue to hold everything in place, there are also 90 screws inside the tablet’s case, a number that iFixit finds “exceptionally high”.
* iFixIt gave the Surface Pro a repairability score one out of ten (ten is easiest to repair).
* Although the Surface Pro battery is not soldered to the motherboard (no soldering is required to replace it) and has a removable SSD, iFixit notes that users risk killing their tablet by trying to open it.
* There are over 90 screws inside this device. We’re proponents of mechanical fasteners, but this number is a tad crazy. The display assembly (comprising of a fused glass and LCD) is extremely difficult to remove / replace.
* “Tons of adhesive” hold everything in place, including the display and battery.

* The findings for the Surface Pro are a bit odd, particularly since this version was touted as an improvement from the earlier Surface RT.
* By comparison, iFixIt gave both the iPad 3 and iPad 4 a slightly higher repairability score of two out of ten. The Surface RT, however, was awarded a repairability score of four out of ten. The difference may not be glaring, but the peek inside suggests neither company want to make hardware upgrades by tablet owners easy.
* In addition, both Google’s Nexus 7 and Amazon’s Kindle Fire beat the full-size iPad with a seven out of ten and eight out of ten repairability score, respectively.
* Here’s the latest Surface Pro commercial.
* The iFixit teardown also called Microsoft’s decision to glue-in the Surface Pro battery a sign of “planned obsolescence” as well as “completely unnecessary.”
* The restrictions against popping the Surface Pro case and upgrading the tiny 4GB of memory even leaves some after-market hardware suppliers out in the cold, prompting us to bring out the old “buyer beware” sign – especially when it comes to these take it or leave it tablet designs.
