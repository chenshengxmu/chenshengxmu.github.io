title: FolderEnhancer Tweak Makes Your iPhone Folders Better
---
* FolderEnhancer is a jailbreak application by Japanese developer Ashikase that should be available in Cydia soon. This is still a beta project but it seems to be very promising.
* According to this video, FolderEnhancer will allow to open folders much faster than Apple’s stock folders, and it will also allow us to have multiple pages of icons within a folder. Another interesting feature is that we’ll finally be able to add folders insider folders…
* FolderEnhancer is compatible with other jailbreak apps such as Iconoclasm and MultiIconMover. Apparently, Chpwn will also be working on making InfiniFolders compatible with FolderEnhancer.
* Looks like a great app, doesn’t it?
