* Following today’s iOS 11.3, tvOS 11.3 and watchOS 4.3 releases, Apple also launched iTunes 12.7.4 for Mac and Windows with music videos and playlists for Apple Music members.
* To update your iTunes, choose App Store from the Apple menu and click the Updates tab.
* “iTunes now includes a new music video experience for Apple Music,” the company wrote in the changelog accompanying the download. “Find what’s new and popular in Music Videos within Browse and play videos back-to-back with exclusive music video playlists.”
* Apple’s curated video playlists offer some interesting possibilities. As an example, Apple TV owners can now enjoy the latest releases by watching music videos in the stock Music app.
* As we reported, this new section began appearing yesterday for both iOS 11.2.6 and iOS 11.3 users in the stock Music app on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices.

* To get started, select the Browse section and then click Music Videos.
* As mentioned, this is another perk for Apple Music members. Sadly, those who are not subscribed to Apple’s music-streaming service won’t be able to enjoy music videos.
* Aside from featured music videos and playlists, it brings special features like “Spotlight on Taylor Swift” and a bunch of genre-based playlists tailored to your personal tastes.
