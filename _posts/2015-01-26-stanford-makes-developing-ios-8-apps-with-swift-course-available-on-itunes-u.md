* Stanford has made its ‘Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift’ course available on iTunes U on Monday, helping beginners gain an understanding of Apple’s new programming language.
* The course is available to download for free, and Stanford says you should have C language and object-oriented programming experience already to make the most of the course. 
* The course offers an overview of tools and APIs required to build applications for the iPhone and iPad platforms using the iOS SDK, as well as guiding you through object-oriented design using model-view-controller paradigm, memory management, and the Swift programming language. Other topics include: animation, mobile device power management, multi-threading, networking and performance considerations.
* Swift was introduced at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference, designed to work with Apple’s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. Swift is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code than Objective-C, and also more concise.
* Stanford’s School of Engineering offers a class every year on developing for iOS and OS X and is gracious enough to post lectures on iTunes U for all to see.
* You can download the lectures from iTunes U.
