* iPhone X has introduced a fair share of all-new gestural interactions for the commonly used iOS features that used to require Home button presses or taps. In addition, the handset provides some previously unavailable shortcuts, like instant jumping to your last-used app.
* You probably know that the horizontal line at the bottom of the iPhone X display (it’s called Home indicator) can be swiped across to quickly cycle through the recently-used apps.

* It’s my favorite gesture. Every time I use it, I’m amazed by its wonderful execution.
* A quick horizontal swipe with my thumb across the Home indicator is just what I need when, say, copying text from a webpage in Safari into Mail or adding things to Notes from another app. It’s natural, very smooth and faster than invoking the iOS app switcher.
* But what if you’re on the Home screen and want to jump quickly to your last-used app?
* Well, there’s a gesture for that, too!
* As mentioned, iPhone X offers an undocumented shortcut which lets you instantly jump from any Home screen to the app you were using last. In order to do that, swipe right across the bottom of the Dock over the area where the Home indicator usually appears.

* And just like that, your last-used app swooshes into view.
* This time-saving gesture should boost your productivity, especially if you’re like me and tend to frequently jump back and forth between the Home screen and the current app, i.e. to find something using iOS’s Search feature (previously known as Spotlight).

* Again, this gesture works only if you’re on your Home screen.
