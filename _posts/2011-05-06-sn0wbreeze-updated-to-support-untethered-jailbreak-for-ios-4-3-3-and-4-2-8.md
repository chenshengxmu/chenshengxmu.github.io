* As you’ve probably already seen with RedSn0w and PwnageTool, i0n1c has updated his untether exploit to support Apple’s latest firmware. Like the previously mentioned titles, Sn0wbreeze has been updated to support iOS 4.3.3.
* This release comes less than 72 hours after Apple dropped the new iOS software, which fixes the location bug we told you about last month. Though many of you folks didn’t have much of a reason to upgrade, for those who did, we have you covered…
* iH8sn0w updated Sn0wbreeze to 2.7 and added support for the new firmwares (GSM and CDMA). Whether you are on 4.3.3 or have a Verizon iPhone on 4.2.8, Sn0wbreeze can jailbreak your iDevice by installing a custom IPSW file. You can also setup custom boot logos and even set a custom root partition size.
* If you want to check out Sn0wbreeze 2.7, it’s available in our downloads section for Windows users. Not sure how to use this thing? iDB is all over it, just check out our Sn0wbreeze tutorial.
* Which tool do you prefer to use when jailbreaking?
