* CNN updated its iPhone app this morning, bringing it to version 2.4. You may recall Apple SVP Phil Schiller showing off this app on stage at last week’s iPhone event, highlighting the way that it takes advantage of the larger displays of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
* It looks like today’s update brings that support for the two new smartphones, as well as a handful of other enhancements. CNN says that the app has a much improved landscape mode—which looks great on my iPhone 5s—prettier photo galleries and more.
* Here is your full change log:
* What’s New in Version 2.4 – Updated design for iPhone 6 – Improved landscape experience – Enhanced photo galleries – Minor bug fixes
* As Phil Schiller mentioned on stage, CNN has redesigned its app to take advantage of the larger displays in the new iPhones. You can see the new split-screen landscape mode in the image above, which is from my 5s. I bet it looks way better on an iPhone 6/6 Plus.
* Anyway, if you want to check out the update, you can find the CNN App for iPhone in the App Store for free. And for those wondering, both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available for pre-order right now, and are slated to begin hitting store shelves Friday morning.
* Thanks Matt!
