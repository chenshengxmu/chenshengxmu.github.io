* Apple’s troubled MobileMe online services suite was officially shut down on this day a year ago. Following the iCloud announcement back in the summer of 2011, Apple originally told MobileMe users they could keep their current storage, in addition to the five free gigabytes of iCloud storage to help with the transition.
* As the August 1, 2012 deadline was approaching, Apple had changed its mind and extended MobileMe users’ complimentary iCloud storage upgrade to another year. As that plan is now set to expire on September 30, the iPhone maker has started emailing former MobileMe account holders to inform them of the impending iCloud storage downgrade…
* Jordan Golson of MacRumors received the following communique from Apple.
* As a thank you for being a former MobileMe member, you received a 20GB complimentary storage upgrade when you moved to iCloud. Your upgrade expires on September 30, 2013.
* When it expires, your iCloud storage will be automatically adjusted to the free 5 GB plan.
* The message goes on to inform the user about their current iCloud storage use and cautions that “if you exceed your storage plan on September 30, 2013, iCloud Backup, Documents in the Cloud and iCloud Mail will temporarily stop working”.
* The remedy is simple: either reduce the amount of iCloud storage being used or upgrade your iCloud storage plan to one of the paid tiers by September 30, Apple writes.
* iCloud upgrades are available in 10/20/50GB buckets, priced at $20/$40/$100 a year.
