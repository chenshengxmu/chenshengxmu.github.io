* Panic is one of my favorite Mac developers, was even more so in the pre-iPhone days when top-notch Mac apps were somewhat few and far between.
* Now, Panic has successfully transitioned itself to the world of concurrent Mac/iOS development, having released a very nice iOS SSH app aptly named Prompt.
* And if you’re a web developer, an iPad version of Coda is a must-have. The firm has kept mum on its future iOS releases, but they’ve been obviously working behind the scenes on a major new app. Both a tweet and the Panic web site now tease the upcoming software, with a ticker on panic.com reading “current status: this Wednesday, a brand new iPad app from Panic.”
* UPDATE: we think we know what the app is about and you’re going to love it! Go past the fold for the full disclosure…
* I checked out both their blog and Twitter feed, in addition to reaching out to developers in order to learn more about the mysterious app, but to no avail.
* I never realistically expected them to share details – why spoil the element of surprise?
* Current Status: this Wednesday, a brand new iPad app from Panic. panic.com

* The reason I’m sharing this with you is Panic’s proven ability to come up with some exquisitely designed and sticky software. And if Prompt for the iPhone/iPad and Diet Coda for iPad are anything to go by, Panic’s third iOS app should be something to behold.
* I’m only concerned about their pricing strategy as neither Prompt nor Diet Coda come cheap: Prompt costs eight bucks for the universal binary version, while Diet Coda for iPad is a whopping twenty bucks.
* On the other hand, neither is a mainstream app so these prices are probably reasonable to those who code for a living.
* I’m thinking Panic is about to unveil an iPad version of Transmit, one of the best Mac FTP clients around. Or, how about a beautiful tablet version of Panic’s gorgeous office status board, depicted below?

* The again, maybe it’s an entirely new thing, something for the masses that will cost no more than a few bucks, or maybe even give it away and make revenue from ads or in-app purchases?
* UPDATE: according to web developer Will Smidlein, it’s indeed a dashboard app for weather, social streams, stats, etc.
* . @joshhelfferich found @panic’s latest app (and it totally makes sense with “not the status quo”) and I am debating buying an iPad now.

* He also discovered an unprotected app screenshot on Panic’s web site and pointed us to it in another tweet.

* Heck, even if it were a calculator app, Panic is doing enough on the UI front to make it worth it.
