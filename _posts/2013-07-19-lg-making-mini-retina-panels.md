* The inexact DigiTimes is reporting this morning that the next-generation iPad mini will feature a Retina display, and is expected to be introduced in October. The report is in direct contradiction to the publication’s own scoop from earlier this week.
* On Monday, the Taiwanese outlet added to speculation that Apple was delaying the launch of its Retina iPad mini until 2014 due to panel shortages. But apparently, LG has made significant progress with its production, and it’s back on track for the fall…
* Here’s the scoop:
* “The sources also added that LG is reportedly making new headway in producing Retina panel technology for use in the next-generation iPad mini, and expects to ship about 2-3 million units a month in preparation for Apple’s expected October release date.”
* This is great news for folks hoping to see a Retina-flavored iPad mini this fall, as there have been multiple reports in recent weeks saying that it wasn’t going to happen. Here’s one from Taiwan’s Economic Daily News, and one from NPD DisplaySearch.
* The consensus seemed to be that Retina panel shortages had forced Apple’s leadership to settle for a minor iPad mini update this fall, and a Retina update in early 2014. Other pundits felt that the technical hurdles—size, battery life, etc—were just too great.
* But here’s hoping that DigiTimes got it right this time, and the iPad mini will finally get a proper display this year. The current 1024×768 screen has been the one complaint that product reviewers have had with the tablet in their otherwise glowing reports.
* The site goes on to reiterate that the upcoming 5th generation iPad will be lighter, smaller and more powerful than its predecessor. And says that it too is expected to launch in the third quarter this year, alongside the new mini and multiple new iPhones.
