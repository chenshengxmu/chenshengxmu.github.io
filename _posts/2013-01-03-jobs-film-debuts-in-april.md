* Great news movie buffs, it’s just been officially announced that the jOBS film starring Ashton Kutcher will hit theaters in a few months. The movie, which has garnered a lot of attention from the media, takes a biographical look at Steve Jobs’ life.
* Last month, we heard that the flick was going to debut at the Sundance Film Festival later this month. And today we’ve learned that Five Star Feature Film and Open Road Films are teaming up to distribute the film, and it’s coming in April…
* From the press release (via 9to5Mac):
* “Open Road Films has partnered with Five Star Feature Films on jOBS, the highly anticipated film chronicling the story of Steve Jobs’ ascension from college dropout to one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century. As previously announced, jOBS will premiere as the closing night film at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. The film will be released in April 2013. The announcement was made today by Tom Ortenberg, CEO of Open Road Films and Mark Hulme of Five Star Feature Films.”
* The film is directed by Joshua Michael Stern, written by Matthew Whitely, shot by Oscar—winning cinematographer Russell Carpenter and produced by Mark Hulme. And as most of you know by now, it features Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs.
* The choice to cast Kutcher as Jobs has received a ton of criticism since the announcement. Many folks don’t believe that Kutcher, who is known for his comedy roles, has the chops to play the late CEO. But he might just end up surprising them.
* Ashton certainly looks the part, and from all accounts I’ve read, he’s taking the role extremely seriously. There aren’t any actual reviews up yet, but there should be several after jOBS is shown on January 27, the last night of the Sundance Film Festival.
* Of course, there’s another, more big-budgety Steve Jobs film in the works — the one being written by Aaron Sorkin and backed by Sony. But as of now, there’s not any new information on that front.
