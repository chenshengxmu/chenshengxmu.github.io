* Unless you happen to use the Slideshow feature on your iPad on a regular basis, there’s a good chance that you don’t need that shortcut on your Lock screen. So what do you do with it?
* Well, you have a few choices. You can either disable the shortcut in Settings, by turning off Picture Frame. Or, you can use a tweak like Zeus, and turn the shortcut into something useful…
* Zeus is a new tweak in Cydia that allows you to convert the Slideshow icon on your Lock screen into a shortcut for any other application — stock or third party. That way, you can launch your favorite iPad game or app with a single tap, without ever having to unlock your device.
* I used Zeus to replace the Slideshow icon with a shortcut for Tweetbot on my iPad, and I love it. It looks sharp, it launches the app quickly, and I haven’t noticed any stability issues since I installed it.
* About the only thing you may not like about Zeus is its price tag. The developer is charging $1 for a tweak that it seems like we’ve seen done, or will see done in the future, for free.
* At any rate, if you want to check Zeus out for yourself it’s available in the ZodTTD & MacCiti repo, in Cydia.
* What do you think of Zeus?
