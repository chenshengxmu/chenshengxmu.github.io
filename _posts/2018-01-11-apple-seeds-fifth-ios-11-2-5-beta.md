* Apple on Thursday seeded the fifth beta of iOS 11.2.5 to developers. Registered developers can install the new beta from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using the over-the-air update mechanism in iOS.
* The update comes just a few days after the release of iOS 11.2.5 beta 4, and as we noted then, there doesn’t appear to be any new user-facing features. It’s likely just bringing about under-the-hood improvements.
* We’re currently installing beta 5 on our devices, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
