* As promised, Apple kicked its ‘Red Friday’ sales event off today in several Asian countries to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Unlike the recent Black Friday event it held here in the US, Apple is offering cash discounts on its products—not gift cards.
* Also different is the fact that the Red Friday promotion includes price cuts on all current iPhone models and the new Retina iPad mini. Apple doesn’t usually discount its handsets, as they are extremely popular and provide (by far) the largest margins…

* The Lunar New Year sale is a one-day event, being held in several Asian countries including China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. And if you live in one of these areas, it’s definitely worth checking out the promotion.
* Apple is offering a discount of around $50 off full-priced iPhones, $40 off the iPad Air and $30 off the iPad mini with Retina display. There are also small discounts available for the original iPad mini and iPad 2, and it looks like all Mac models are $100 off.
