* United Airlines updated its iOS app this morning, bringing the client to version 2.0.16. The update includes support for a new feature the company is testing out that enables users to scan their passports to check-in for international flights using their device’s camera.
* United is calling the trial feature “Expanded International Check-In,” and its purpose is to allow international passengers to complete their check-in process and print their boarding pass before arriving at the airport. All it takes is a quick photo scan of their passport…
* Here’s more from United’s press release:
* Customers checking-in for international flights on their mobile devices within 24 hours of departure now have the convenient option of either verifying their existing stored passport data or scanning their passport. The app uses the mobile device’s camera feature to capture travelers’ passports, similar to a mobile banking deposit.
* Jumio, a credentials management service, will then verify the passport information for additional security. Once the verification process is complete, customers may obtain a boarding pass. Customers requiring additional travel documentation, such as visas, will continue to check-in at the airport.
* Additionally, today’s update includes the ability to see what time boarding ends for your particular flight, So if you need to run to the restroom, grab a drink or a quick bite to eat, you’ll know if you have time to do so and make it back to your gate before your plane takes off.
* United has been leading the way for airlines in the mobile era since 2007, when it was the first to offer mobile boarding passes. If you happen to be flying with them, and own a smartphone, this app is a must have. You can find the United Airlines app in the App Store for free.
