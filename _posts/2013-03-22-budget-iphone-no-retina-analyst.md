* Apple’s rumored less-expensive iPhone aimed at emerging markets won’t just shave costs by having a polycarbonate body instead of Unibody aluminum design, it is bound to have a standard-resolution screen rather than Apple’s Retina display, like other iDevices. That’s at least what one analyst wrote in a note to clients Friday, based on the often unreliable supply chain checks.
* He’s also calling for a June or July launch for both the budget iPhone and the iPhone 5S (a specs upgrade to the iPhone 5), which is the time frame that was mentioned previously in a few other recent reports…
* A note by RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani (via AppleInsider) reads:
* Our supply-chain checks indicate that AAPL is working to launch multiple new phones in the June/July time-frame this year. Specifically, AAPL will launch the iPhone5s and a more affordable but lower-end iPhone at the same time, in either late CYQ2 or early Q3.
* The low-end iPhone will have the same 4″ form factor as the iPhone5 but will have plastic casing and no retina display. With a lower price-point, AAPL will be able to target a growing and important part of the Smartphone market (sub-$400 price-band).
* Other analysts are not so sure about a non-Retina budget iPhone.

* For example, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo – who has a decent track record reporting on Apple – recently said that the rumored device will incorporate the same four-inch Retina display as Apple’s existing iPhone 5.
* According to Kuo, the specs for the device were apparently decided on back in 2011 and include a Retina display, a “super-thin plastic casing mixed with glass fiber” and a bunch of colors, a first for the iPhone.
* And in another report issued to clients, Kuo wrote he expected both the iPhone 5S and a low-cost model to support FDD networking and launch in July alongside iOS 7.
* “The new iPhones this year are mainly designed on the basis of the current iPhone 5, which suggests development time could be reduced,” he said.
* Gee, summer can’t come soon enough!
