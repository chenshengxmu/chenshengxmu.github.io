* Google has confirmed that the official apps for its over-the-top YouTube TV service for Apple TV, Roku and older Smart TVs have been delayed until the first quarter of next year.
* A company representative confirmed to CNET that the cord-cutting service won’t have the necessary streaming apps for Apple TV, Roku and older Smart TV models readied this year.
* The Apple TV app was originally scheduled for a launch before the end of 2017.
* As part of the update, YouTube will also debut apps for older models of Linux-powered Sony TV sets and Samsung’s smart TVs manufactured in 2014 and 2015.
* These apps are currently available for the web, iPhone, Android, Chromecast, Xbox One and Android TV platforms, plus 2016 and 2017 Smart TVs from the likes of Samsung and LG.
* Separately, Google said it’ll pull the main YouTube app from Amazon’s Fire TV and Echo Show devices by the end of 2018 due to what the company attributed to “lack of reciprocity.”
* “We’ve been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other’s products and services, but Amazon doesn’t carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn’t make Prime Video available for Google Cast users and last month stopped selling some of Nest’s latest products,” the company said in a recent statement.
* “Given this lack of reciprocity,” the search giant continue, ”we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV.”
* Priced at $35 per month, YouTube TV is currently available in a few US cities, offering access to live TV streaming from Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC and popular cable networks along with content from more than three-dozen local broadcast networks and channels like ESPN.
* DVR with unlimited cloud storage is included in the subscription at no additional charge.
* YouTube TV for iPhone and iPad is available on App Store.
