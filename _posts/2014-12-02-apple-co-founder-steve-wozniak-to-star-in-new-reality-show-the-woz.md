* Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak will star in an upcoming reality show called ‘The Woz’, where with former Mythbusters star Kari Byron he’ll show off the latest gadgets and future of technology. 
* According to a press release obtained by Gizmodo, ‘The Woz’ “introduces the audience to facilities where science fiction is quickly becoming reality.” Woz will have hands-on time with futuristic gadgets, and if you remember anything from Mythbusters, Kari will more than likely provide some hilarious anecdotes and hijinks.
* Running around with Woz all day is hilarious. Such a sweetheart.

* Wozniak has always been known for his love of new gadgets. Interestingly, the Apple co-founder is never scared to criticize the Cupertino-based company, having said Apple is three years late with the iPhone 6 and that it should make an Android phone.
* Exact details for the show are still scant. Gizmodo reports the show has been pitched to Discovery, but it’s not clear exactly where it will be picked up.
* This should be entertaining.
