* Apple on Tuesday released the fourth beta of OS X El Capitan 10.11.2. The update is labeled build 15C47a, and is available to developers and public testers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store, or through Apple’s beta test site.
* Today’s release comes just one week after Apple pushed out beta 3 of OS X 10.11.2, suggesting the firmware is nearing completion, and it has been nearly a month since the last public update to OS X (10.11.1), which added 150 new emoji.
* There’s no word yet on what changes OS X 10.11.2 will bring, but we do know Apple has asked developers to focus on Graphics, Mail, Wi-Fi, Calendar, Notes, Photos, and Spotlight. We’ll let you know if we come across anything significant.
