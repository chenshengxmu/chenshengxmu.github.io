* If you’re searching for some additional control over your iPhone’s wallpaper, then WAlpha is available to help.
* No, it has nothing to do with Wolfram Alpha, I too thought the same thing and was a bit disappointed when I found out otherwise. Instead, WAlpha stands for Wallpaper Alpha, and it does one thing and one thing only: allows you to adjust the alpha settings for the wallpaper on your Home screen and Lock screen.
* WAlpha features an overall kill switch in the Settings app, and a slider to adjust the alpha settings. Depending on your wallpaper, it can make a visual difference, and is especially helpful for your keeping your Lock screen wallpaper bright and cheery if that’s what you’re seeking.
* If this sounds interesting to you, head over to Cydia and give WAlpha a try. It’s compatible with jailbroken iDevice’s running iOS 4.x and iOS 5.x, so you should have no problem getting it to work.
* Let us know what you think about WAlpha in the comments section.
