* Apple updated its iCloud website yesterday with additional information on its new iCloud storage plans. As of today, those storage plans are now live, allowing users to purchase additional iCloud storage of up to 1TB using the new pricing.
* Of course, customers will continue to get 5GB of cloud storage for free, but Apple has dropped the pricing on the rest of its iCloud offerings ahead of the launch of iOS 8, OS X Yosemite and iCloud Drive. Keep reading for a quick rundown.
* Users can now purchase 20GB of storage for $0.99 per month, 200GB for $3.99, 500GB for $9.99, and 1TB for $19.99. Upgrading is as easy as navigating to the Settings app on your iOS device, iCloud > Storage & Backup > Buy More Storage.
* As we’ve said before, there are certainly cheaper options available, like Dropbox, which overs 1TB of storage for $9.99 per month. But folks looking for a more native solution, especially with iCloud Drive coming, will appreciate the new pricing.
* Will you be upgrading your iCloud storage plan?
