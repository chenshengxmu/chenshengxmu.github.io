* After Cydia was crippled by the the recent Amazon EC2 outage, jailbreakers have been seeking out alternative options to get their favorite iOS extensions. Currently, Cydia is widely known as the “only” jailbroken app store, but it certainly seems like the Infini Dev Team is looking to change that.
* You may recognize them as the developers who are bringing back the popular Icy package installer, which has been absent from the jailbreak scene since iOS 3.0. But Icy’s not the only Cydia challenger these guys have been working on. They have another project in the oven called Lima…
* The intriguing thing about Lima is the fact that this package installer won’t have a home screen icon. It will instead be browser-based, allowing jailbroken users to just navigate to a website in Safari to get their favorite apps and tweaks.
* Judging from the video, Lima seems to be very simple and straight forward. It also appears to be snappier than either of the other contenders. A browser-based installer actually makes a lot of sense. By cutting the need to download an application, they’ve removed a major barrier between their product and the masses.
* Lima is currently a work in progress, but we will be sure to let you know when it is available.
* What do you think? Are you excited for browser-based installer, or are you a Cydia/Icy fan?
