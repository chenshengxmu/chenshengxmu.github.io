* Folks in the market for an iPad Air will be happy to hear that Apple is now offering refurbished versions of the late-model tablet in its web store. You can find them in the ‘Refurbished and Clearance’ section listed at the bottom of Apple’s online store landing page.
* It looks like both 16GB and 32GB [Wi-Fi only] iPad Airs are available, in either Space Grey or White, with 3-5 day shipping estimates. And with the 16GB models starting at just $419—these are some of the lowest price we’ve seen on these tablets in recent months…
* As noted by deal site 9to5Toys, Apple lists all storage models on its website, but selecting either the 64GB or 128GB Air returns the ‘Out of Stock’ message. So your only options right now, with supplies limited, are the 16GB for $419 or the 32GB model for $509.

* Admittedly the term ‘refurbished’ is usually a red flag for consumers, but it’s worth noting that Apple’s program isn’s like what you see on eBay or at second-hand stores. Apple’s refurbished products come with a new back and battery and a full one year of AppleCare.
* If you’d rather just buy your iPad new, it looks like Best Buy is still offering various Air models at a $50 discount.
