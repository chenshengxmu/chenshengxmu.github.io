* The Infinity Blade trilogy, an elegiac masterpiece built on the powerful Unreal Engine, has just gone free to celebrate the Fourth of July. In previous instances, some of the installments in this iOS-exclusive mobile franchise did go temporarily free, but this is the first time that developer Chair Entertainment has slashed the complete trilogy to just zero bucks. Grab Infinity Blade, Infinity Blade II and Infinity Blade III for free.
* For those unfamiliar with the series, Infinity Blade is a hack’n’slash game with RPG elements, great soundtrack and spectacular visuals that take full advantage of the power of the Apple-designed silicon—you’re going to be blown away by the vast environments presented in detailed 3D graphics.
* A gesture-driven combat is simple for anyone to pick up and an RPG-like upgrade system for your weapons, characters and other objects ensures you’ll get significant longevity out of the series.
* These triple-A titles used to sell for $6.99 each so you’re basically looking at a double-digit savings here. Each game in the series requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 8.0 or later and supports full iPhone 6/6s and iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus resolutions.
* Bonus content like Soul Hunter, Ausar Rising, Blade Masters and Kingdom Come expansion packs is included in your free download.
* As mentioned, Infinity Blade, Infinity Blade II and Infinity Blade III are temporarily free in the App Store for July 4 only so grab them now if you haven’t already.
* Happy Independence Day!
