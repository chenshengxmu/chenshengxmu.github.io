* If you needed proof that Apple is actively researching a wearable device akin to a smartwatch, look no further than a Japan Patent Office filing from early June for an ‘iWatch’ trademark. As discovered by Bloomberg, the filing specifically mentions a “watch device” and a “handheld computer”. While this by no means such a product will see the light of day, it certainly fuels speculation that an Apple-branded smartwatch is in the works…
* The report has it:
* The maker of iPhones is seeking protection for the name which is categorized as being for products including a handheld computer or watch device, according to a June 3 filing with the Japan Patent Office that was made public last week.
* Yahoo Japan has this image of the ‘iWatch’ trademark.

* Keep in mind that Bloomberg reported back in February that Apple has a team of at least a hundred engineers tasked with the iWatch project.
* The news organization also said in April that Apple was facing hurdles in terms of battery life due to the decision to power the smartwatch by a version of iOS. The device is said to include biometric sensors and double as a life monitoring accessory akin to the Nike Fuleband and similar types of gadgets.
* It was discovered last month that Apple also applied for an ‘iWatch’ trademark in Japan.
* The firm typically files for ownership of product names before their official announcement so this could be a sold proof that the rumored wearable device project is more than an afterthought.
