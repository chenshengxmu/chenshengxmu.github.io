* Following today’s event, select attendees were given the opportunity to go hands-on with a working version of the Apple Watch. You may recall, Apple allowed journalists to try out demo versions of the wearable when it debuted last fall, but this is much different.
* This time around, folks were actually allowed to launch apps, navigate menus and play with various features. We’ve collected a number of videos showing these initial impressions, in an effort to help paint a proper picture of what to expect when you get your Watch next month.

* Looking through the videos, the consensus seems to be that the touchscreen on Apple Watch is responsive, animations are fluid and overall performance is what you’d expect. You do notice, though, what appears to be a slight lag when launching certain apps.
* The Apple Watch will be available for pre-order starting April 10, and will begin shipping on April 24. Prices start at $349 for the least expensive model, and go all the way to $17,000. For more information on this and other announcements from today, click here.
