* Although the whole Chuck Norris Facts meme has ran its course, apparantly there is a jailbreak developer that doesn’t want to let it die.
* Chuck Norris Facts for Chatbot is an AssistantExtensions plugin that will spout off Chuck Norris “facts” faster than Chuck Norris can roundhouse kick a saber-toothed tiger…
* To enable Chuck Norris Facts, you will need to invoke the AssistantExtensions Chatbot interface using Siri. If you’re at a loss as to how to do this, be sure to watch our AssistantExtensions video for more info.
* Once Chatbot is loaded, simply say: “Chuck Norris,” and Siri will start spouting off various details about the world’s favorite Texas ranger.
* Chuck Norris Facts for Chatbot is a free plugin available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. You must have an iOS 5 capable device with Siri to use this plugin.
* What do you think?
