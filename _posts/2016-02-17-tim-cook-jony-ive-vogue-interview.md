* Apple’s boss Tim Cook and Jony Ive, its Chief Design Officer charged with blue sky thinking, have discussed several topics of interest in a new interview published in the March 2016 edition of the Vogue magazine.
* The two executives talked the synergy between Apple and fashion, the Apple Watch, partnership with the luxury French brand Hermes and the upcoming flying saucer-shaped Campus 2 building, Apple’s future headquarters.
* The Norman Foster-designed glass and steel Campus 2 building should be completed by the end of this year, if all goes planned. Currently, there’s a massive pile of dirt on the site. “Hard to know which is more beautiful, the building or that pile of dirt,” Cook said.
* That dirt will actually be used to nourish a forest of more than 7,000 trees. The $5 billion, 2.8 million–square foot structure, originally commissioned by late Steve Jobs in 2009, will incorporate a whopping four miles of curved glass and will be powered by one of the world’s largest solar-paneling grids.

* “The sheets of glass are so long, so clear, that you don’t feel that there is a wall between you and the landscape,” said Foster.
* “And at the same time the building is an echo of the ethos of Apple, which designs artifacts that, though they fulfill all sorts of functions, exist abstractly in their own right.”
* That great big pile of dirt from the excavation?
* Check it out in an aerial footage below, which was captured (along with a close-up look at iSpaceship’s underground auditorium by drone pilot Duncan Sinfield.
* “In what we do,” said Cook, “design is crucial, as it is in fashion.”
* Taking note of the growing synergy between Apple and the fashion world, Ive told Vogue that today’s technology is what Apple’s been dreaming about since its inception.
* “Nine years ago, the iPhone didn’t exist, and the most personal product we had was too big to carry around with you,” he said.
* “The technology is at last starting to enable something that was the dream of the company from the very beginning—to make technology personal.”
* So personal, he said, “that you can wear it.”

* Fashion designer Tom Ford, Vogue notes, views Apple products “as fashion accessories”. To that end, Apple will be sponsoring the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute this May in the exhibition entitled “Manus x Machina”.
* According to Ive, what was seen at one time as the most sophisticated technology “eventually becomes tradition. ”There was a time when even the metal needle would have been seen as shocking and profoundly new,” he said.
* The full interview isn’t too long a read so check it out now, or save it for later.
