* Apple’s upcoming OLED-based iPhone 8 won’t start shipping out to buyers until October or early November, sources said, adding that its much larger Power button that appears on leaked CAD drawings won’t integrate Touch ID functions as some have suspected.
* That’s the gist of today’s report from the fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara.
* According to the machine-translated version of the original article, sources expect the iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates to start shipping out to customers in September.
* Some of the leaked CAD drawings have depicted an elongated Power button on the side of the device, leading watchers to speculate that it might integrate a fingerprint sensor.
* According to Mac Otakara, that won’t be the case after all, with sources commenting that the larger button appears solid and with no Touch ID-related parts or other sensors.
* A source who saw iPhone 8’s front display part said Apple may only release the phone in black.
* The device may pack in a few new front-facing sensors, including 3D sensors for augmented reality, 3D mapping, advanced facial recognition and other features, while the selfie camera is said to be relocated to the right side.
