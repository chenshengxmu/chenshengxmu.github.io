* Just about twenty four hours after releasing iOS 10.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 1 to developers, Apple has now released the same versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems for beta testers.
* Coming with the usual round of bug fixes and stability improvements, iOS 10.1 beta 1’s most notable feature is the new Portrait mode available on iPhone 7 Plus only.
* As for macOS, it also offers the same performance improvements, and also offers support for Portrait albums in the Photos app.
* There doesn’t seem to be much more than that in these first betas, but if you do find something interesting, make sure to let us know!
