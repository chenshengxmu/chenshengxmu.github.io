title: How to surf lighter and declutter Safari by disabling images on Mac
---
* Want to surf like it’s the 90s again? Back when the interweb was not plastered with dizzying amounts of pictures and ads, surfing the world wide web meant more textual content, less distractions and perhaps most importantly way less data usage.

* If any (or all) of those three conveniences speak to you, wait no more and try it for yourself on your MacBook today. You might just notice your productivity take a leap forward.
* Besides making it a lot easier for you to focus on the words written (because that’s what the internet was originally conceived for) on any website, disabling images is also by extension going to contract articles, most of the time resulting in more content available at a glance. The setting certainly does not rival professional ad-blockers in terms of in-browser advertising, however depending on their placement a fair number of unwanted images will too become subject to the block. Without further ado, let’s run you through it!
* 1) Pull up Safari from your Dock or Applications folder.
* 2) In your menu bar, click Safari and open Preferences.

* 3) Navigate to the Advanced tab inside settings.
* 4) Tick the (presumably) empty box reading Show Develop menu in menu bar. If this one is already activated proceed to step 5 or skip to the end, as you might know full well where this is headed!

* 5) Close the Preferences interface and turn your attention back to the top menu bar. You will now spot a new tab sitting comfortably between Bookmarks and Window: pop open Develop.
* 6) Final sprint, the drop down list will unveil a host of options including Disable Images about half way down the ladder. Select it and make sure a little tick next to it confirms the selection.

* 7) Almost home. If there is no instant change to the Safari layout in front of you briefly reload your browser window (hit ⌘+R or click the circular arrow next to your URL bar). This will apply the new restriction to your current tab. For any new tabs, the setting will already be active.
* Over and out, that’s the whole trick! If you’re still on the fence about the pros and cons of the setting, have a quick look at a news website completely picked at random. By way of example, here’s the NY Times with and without images.
* Images enabled,

* versus images disabled.

* So there. The usefulness of the setting absolutely varies from instance to instance and there are many stronger (and also weaker) cases that can be made in favor of disabling images. Then again, there is no question that it will consistently save you data, compress pages and thereby give you more information at a look. Plus it’s almost a given you will be a whole lot faster consuming your daily dose of blogs or news on the internet.
