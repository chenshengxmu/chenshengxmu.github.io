* Thanks to a new hack for running iPad apps on the iPhone, someone has been able to successfully run GarageBand on the iPhone 4. GarageBand is a relatively new addition to iOS that was introduced alongside the iPad 2.
* Although the App Store’s GarageBand is specifically designed for the iPad, it can also be hacked to run on a jailbroken iPhone.
* The app seems to function pretty well once ported. The guy says he used OpenSSH to change the app’s underlying metadata so that it would run on the iPhone.
* There are some obvious scaling and interface issues, but this is still a cool experiment to check out. You can do this yourself through the magic of OpenSSH on a jailbroken iDevice, you just need the right information.
* Apple will probably make GarageBand a universal app in the future. It’s going to be really interesting to see how the iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) work on the iPhone through this method.
* What do you think of GarageBand running on the iPhone 4? Pretty cool, huh?
