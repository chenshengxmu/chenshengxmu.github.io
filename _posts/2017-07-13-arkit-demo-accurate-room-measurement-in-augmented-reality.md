* If the augmented reality (AR) tape measure app we recently featured has gotten you excited for the possibilities that Apple’s ARKit framework brings to developers, you’re wholeheartedly recommended to watch this video demonstration of an upcoming ARKit-driven app that will let you take precise room measurement by pointing your iPhone’s camera at the corners.
* The app will help generate 3D models and automatically calculate the footage for the user. It’s a really cool-looking demo and I can’t wait to try this app out when it releases.
* Watch the demonstration video below.
* The app was created by a company called Smart Pictures, which provides the Measurement Cloud system that enables dimensioning intelligence for the interior world.
* Here’s a recent ARKit-powered tape measure demo that set the Internet on fire.
* This level of precision is made possible by ARKit’s accurate plane detection and reliable object tracking. On existing devices, the ARKit framework leverages data from on-board sensors and uses computer vision algorithms constantly analyzing live camera feed.
* ARKit-driven apps should be even better on iPhone 8 because Apple’s OLED iPhone is said to feature a dedicated 3D laser sensor on both its front and back for even better augmented reality features and faster, more precise autofocus.
