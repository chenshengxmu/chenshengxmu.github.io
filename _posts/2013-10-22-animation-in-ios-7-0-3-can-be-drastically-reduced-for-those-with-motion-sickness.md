* As we noted just a few minutes ago, iOS 7.0.3 is out with a bevy of new features, but one of the most desired features for a lot of folks is likely flying a bit under the radar. If you’re one of those impacted by iOS 7’s animation and parallax effects, then listen up, this pertains to you.
* iOS 7.0.3 contains a much more potent “reduce motion” setting than previous iterations of iOS 7. In past firmware, the Reduce Motion setting located under Settings > General > Accessibility, did little to alleviate the motion sickness experienced by some unfortunate users. That’s all changed with iOS 7.0.3, as the animation effects have been seriously downgraded thanks to an enhanced motion reducing setting.
* As you can see from the video above, the effect is drastically different than before. The Z-axis zooming effects that iOS 7 has been lauded for are reduced to mere fade ins and out with the Reduced Motion toggle flipped on. Previous motion reducing mainly applied to the parallax effect on the Home screen background, and not to general animations.
* I certainly don’t recommend using the setting, unless you are indeed suffering from motion sickness while using iOS. It definitely takes a lot of the wind out of iOS 7’s forward thinking sails and significantly reduces its character.
* What do you think?
