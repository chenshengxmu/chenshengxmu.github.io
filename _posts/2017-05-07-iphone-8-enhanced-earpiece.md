* JPMorgan analysts who track Apple’s supply chain in the Asia-Pacific region, including Gokul Hariharan, shared a new research note this week. In it, the they predicted that the company’s upcoming iPhone 8 will come outfitted with an enhanced earpiece sporting “further improvements” to stereo sound and waterproofing.
* The note, obtained by MacRumors, does not specify what acoustical improvements Apple could introduce to iPhone 8’s earpiece.
* JPMorgan also made the prediction that AirPods could come as a free accessory with iPhone 8. If true, Apple’s $159 wireless earbuds could replace the firm’s $29 wired EarPods with Lightning connector that come in the box with current iPhone models.

* The research note mentions other previously rumored iPhone 8 features, like an OLED display, a stainless steel and glass design, a faster A11 processor, a larger battery, wireless charging and enhanced cameras with new sensors for 3D mapping, 3D selfies, facial recognition, augmented reality capabilities and more.
* The analysts estimate that iPhone 8 will be $75 to $80 more expensive to manufacture.
* iPhone 7 became the first iPhone to feature stereo sound.
* Rather than use two separate speakers at the bottom of the device, Apple has opted to combine a speaker unit at the bottom with the earpiece at the top to create “immersive stereo sound” delivering two times the audio output of iPhone 6s and increased dynamic range.
