* Concluding its four-week promotion celebrating the life of a college student, the beautiful minimalistic puzzle game Bicolor has gone free for a week inside Apple’s official Apple Store client for the iPhone and iPad (not to be confused with the App Store).
* Created by 1Button and released on May 1, Bicolor includes 180 handmade levels, each consisting of just two colors. Bicolor tasks you with completing various patterns in order to clear the board and progress to the next level.
* Priced at 99 cents in the App Store, Bicolor is free for the next seven days exclusively through the Apple Store app.
* Again, this concludes Apple’s four-week college-themed promotion that saw the firm give away the beautiful iOS calculator Tydlig, the gorgeous Rise Alarm Clock, the premium edition of the popular fitness tracking software Runtastic, and now Bicolor.
* Check out the promotional video below.
* The ingenious levels with only two colors have to be played in order to be fully appreciated so I urge you to grab this freebie right now.
* Here’s how you can redeem your free copy of Bicolor.
* Step 1: Download Apple’s official Apple Store mobile app to your iPhone or iPad free from the App Store. Fire up the app, tap the Stores section and choose any retail store under All Stores, or search for a specific store (i.e. ‘Fifth Avenue’).

* Once on the store page, look for Bicolor halfway down the section.
* Step 2: Tap it and you’ll be offered to download Bicolor free of charge. Just hit the big green Download now for free button at the bottom.
* Step 3: Doing so will take you to the App Store. Upon signing in with your Apple ID, hit the Redeem button in the upper right corner.

* Although Apple cautions that this promotion requires redeeming Bicolor using a U.S. Apple ID, iTunes Store or App Store account, some of our non-US readers may be able to take advantage of it.
* If not, you can always create a US-based Apple ID account without a credit card to download apps, music, movies and other free items in the US iTunes Store.
* Will you be redeeming Bicolor?
