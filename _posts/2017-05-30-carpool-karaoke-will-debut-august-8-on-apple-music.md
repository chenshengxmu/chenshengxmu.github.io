* “Carpool Karaoke: The Series,” Apple’s first original show based on the popular segment on “The Late Late Show” with James Corden, will premiere August 8 on Apple Music. The news was revealed in today’s tweet by Eddy Cue, Apple’s chief of Internet Software and Services.
* The show was originally supposed to air on Apple Music beginning April 2017, but the iPhone maker was forced to postpone its arrival due to tight production schedule.
* All sixteen episodes will debut on Tuesdays, available only to Apple Music members.
* Featuring a different host every episode, Apple’s version of “Carpool Karaoke” replaces the show’s regular host James Corden with actors, comedians, athletes and other celebrities, who will be seen riding along in a car together as they’re singing different tunes.
* Some of the confirmed celebrities that will appear on the show include Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena and Shaquille O’Neal.
* “Planet of the Apps,” Apple’s show about apps and their creators, is coming this year. Apple wrapped up filming of that one back in February 2017, but it’s unclear when exactly the company might release it on Apple Music.
