* With Apple’s annual developers conference approaching fast, we’re starting to see some credible leaks pertaining to the iPhone 5S, Apple’s seventh-generation iPhone. We’ve already seen the leaked Home button and vibrator parts earlier this week and claimed speaker parts from before. And with analysts predicting a June launch for the device and Macotakara claiming earlier this month that Foxconn has already started the iPhone 5S production, now the same Japanese blog issues a new report that gives as the reportedly official announcement date for both the iPhone 5S and a more affordable model for emerging markets: Thursday, June 20…
* Macotakara claims to have quality insider knowledge on this and goes on to mention that the iPhone 5S would go on sale shortly after, in early July.
* That sounds like Apple.
* The June 20 keynote would also see a preview of iOS 7 as the software apparently isn’t ready for prime time yet. Finally, the event should also see the unveiling of a less-pricey iPhone featuring a polycarbonate body, with the device going on sale in August.
* Sorry everyone, I really can’t think of anything witty to say about the June 20 iPhone 5S rumor.

* Note that Macotakara has some decent sources in Apple’s supply chain. The publication has established a pretty decent track record reporting on the Apple rumors and has been increasingly accurate lately with these things.
* Another Japanese web site, MacFan, corroborated Macotakara’s report.

* Another credible hint: TechCrunch yesterday ran a story reportedly based on a confidential Foxconn presentation that points to a firm June 2013 launch for the iPhone 5S. “It is some of the most convincing data we’ve seen relating to new Apple launches,” the publication assures us.
* But that’s not all, the internal document allegedly highlights a few new cases and chargers for iPhone devices, including a Qi-enabled wireless chargers and dongles for the iPhone 5.
* Furthermore, TechCrunch singled out one third-party vendor with an interesting inside track to Foxconn which is apparently working with Foxconn directly to launch its product immediately upon the launch of the new iPhones.
* This sort of leak – a launch date, direct contact to a certified manufacturer, and mention of direct cooperation with Foxconn – is fairly unique in the world of Apple news.
* It also suggests a certain lack of fear in manufacturers as they approach a new, post-Steve Jobs Apple.
* Apple hasn’t announced WWDC 2013 yet, but with Google’s I/O scheduled to take place May 15-17 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, Apple for sure won’t be waiting for too long to reveal its cards.
