title: Geohot Raps About Sonys Lawsuit
---
* If you didn’t know yet that Geohot was into hip hop, this one might come as a surprise to you. After being sued by Sony for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3, Geohot decided to respond via a rap video.
* This is actually not bad at all. If the wonder kid doesn’t make a career out of his hacking skills, I’m sure he’ll still be able to make a living off his rapping capacities…
* Yo it’s geohot And for those that don’t know I’m getting sued by Sony
* Let’s take this out of the courtroom and into the streets I’m a beast, at the least, you’ll face me in the northeast Get my ire up, light my fire I’ll go harder then Eminem went at Mariah Call me a liar Pound me in the ass with no lube, chafing You’re fucking with the dude who got the keys to your safe and Those that can’t do bring suits Cry to your Uncle Sam to settle disputes Thought you’d tackle this with a little more tact But then again fudgepackers, I don’t know Jack
* I shed a tear everytime I think of Lik Sang But shit man, they’re a corporation And I’m a personification of freedom for all You fill dockets, like thats a concept foreign to y’all While lawyers muddy water and TROs stall Out of business is jail for me And you’re suing me civilly
* Exhibit this in the courtroom Go on, do it, I dare you
* So, what do you think? Should Sony give up the lawsuit and sign him as the new artist?
