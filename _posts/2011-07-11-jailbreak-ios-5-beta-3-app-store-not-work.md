* iOS 5 Beta 3 has been out for barely half a day, and it’s already been confirmed that you can jailbreak Apple’s latest beta release with RedSn0w. That’s good news for jailbreakers, even if it is only a tethered jailbreak.
* Don’t get too excited, though. Because it seems that jailbreaking iOS 5 Beta 3 will result in you no longer being able to run apps from the App Store…
* ModMyi has uncovered this news via a tweet from Clayton Braasch. Clayton warns that “there’s a sandbox issue causing App Store apps to crash after jailbreaking iOS 5 beta 3.”
* If you perform a tethered jailbreak with RedSn0w, iOS 5 Beta 3 causes all apps from the App Store to crash instantly when opened. We’re not really sure why this is the case, but it will hopefully be corrected in the near future.
* In the meantime, developers should probably stay away from jailbreaking iOS 5 Beta 3.
* Is Apple trying to send the jailbreak community a message here?
* UPDATE: The Dev Team updated RedSn0w to version 0.9.8 beta 2. It is now safe to use RedSn0w to jailbreak iOS 5 beta 3.
