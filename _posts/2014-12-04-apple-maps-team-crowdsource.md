* A new job listing hints the Apple Maps team is working on improving community crowdsourcing, as well as better Siri and Passbook integration. First spotted by 9to5Mac, the listing calls for a ‘Maps Community Client Software Engineer’ to join the Cupertino firm’s growing Maps group.
* According to the position’s description, the engineer will focus on “high level UI development of the ‘Report a Problem’ feature.” They’ll also be working on the frameworks and plugins that enable Maps to “integrate deeply and seamlessly with other applications” such as Siri and Passbook.
* Apple asks that the applicant have strong object-oriented programming and design skills, with solid experience in Cocoa Touch/Objective-C. It also requests that the person have attention to detail, passion for product quality, and excellent analytical, problem-solving and communication skills.
* First introduced in 2012, Apple Maps has been often criticized for inaccurate data and lack of information. A better crowdsourcing infrastructure could certainly  help remedy this, allowing users to quickly and easily submit corrections for various points of interest and updated construction intel.
* Apple has indicated that it has plans to push its Maps app far beyond proprietary mobile software. In 2013, it released a desktop version of the app for Mac, and a November job listing called for a “passionate web developer,” suggesting that we will see a web version of Maps in the near future.
