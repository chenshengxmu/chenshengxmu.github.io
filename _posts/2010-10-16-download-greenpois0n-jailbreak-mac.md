* Whether you’re using the GreenPois0n jailbreak on a PC, Mac or Linux, the steps are exactly the same. Check out our GreenPois0n guide for more information.
* It’s also worth noting that the Dev Team is supposed to release PwnageTool tomorrow. PwnageTool is a Mac only jailbreak that allows you to update to a jailbroken firmware while preserving your baseband, which is key to unlocking your iPhone.
