* iOS 9 packs in a whole bunch of nice-to-haves and small refinements that haven’t even made it into the official release notes.
* Among other things, the operating system introduces a more streamlined Notification Center view in landscape mode which Apple designed to take advantage of the larger screen real estate on iPads.
* The enhanced look is based on a two-column layout to allow the simultaneous display of your Today view in one column and your Notification Center widgets and app notifications in the other, so you don’t have to switch manually between them.
* As you can see for yourself, this new landscape mode takes better advantages of the screen real estate as now both your upcoming events for today and your app notifications/widgets can be enjoyed in a handy side-by-side view.

* In portrait mode, Today and Notifications sections remain in separate views.
* Sadly, the new layout is iPad-only even though it would have proved itself very useful on larger-screened iPhones, especially on the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.
* Have you noticed the new landscape layout for the Notification Center on your iPad yet. And if so, how did you like it? I think it’s a much more useful way of getting an at-a-glance overview of both your day (Today view) and notifications/widgets, wouldn’t you agree?
