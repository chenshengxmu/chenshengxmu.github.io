* Late yesterday, Apple released Safari 7.0.6 for OS X Mavericks and Safari 6.1.6 for OS X Mountain Lion.
* The releases contain improvements to security related to Apple’s desktop browser and are both recommended for all OS X Mavericks and OS X Mountain Lion users.
* These updates follow the release of a new version of OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 (build 13F14) that Apple released to developers yesterday…
* Safari 6.1.6 and Safari 7.0.6 are available for OS X Lion 10.7.5, OS X Lion Server 10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and OS X Mavericks 10.9.4.
* Both fix a WebKit issue where visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. Detailed information about the security content of Safari 6.1.6 and Safari 7.0.6 can be found in Apple’s support document.
* You can update Safari to the latest available version by choosing Software Update… in the Mac menu.
