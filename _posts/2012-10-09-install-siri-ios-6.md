* Would you like to use Siri on your old iPod touch 4th generation or iPhone 4 running iOS 6? The first thing you need to do is jailbreak your device, and then install Cydia.
* Once you’ve jailbroken your device and installed Cydia, you can then add the necessary Cydia repo to install the package needed to configure Siri on these devices.
* Check inside for our full tutorial.
* Note: Do this at your own risk. You’re risking the stability of your device, and your privacy by doing this (see more below). You’ve been aptly warned.
* Step 1: Jailbreak your iOS 6 device, and install Cydia using our step-by-step tutorial found here. Remember this is a tethered jailbreak.
* Step 2: Open Cydia > Manage > Sources > Edit > Add > and type the following repo: http://repo.siriport.ru > Tap Add Source.
* Step 3: Once the source is added, open the SiriPort.Ru source, and find the SiriPort (Original) iOS 6 package. Install that package.
* Step 4: Once back to your Home screen, go to Settings.app and scroll down until you see SiriPort.Ru Original. Open this panel and tap Install Certificate. A Safari window with open. Tap Install Certificate, and then tap OK.
* Step 5: This will bring you to the Install Profile screen. Tap Install, and then tap Install in the upper right-hand corner. You should see “Trusted” in green letters on the Profile Installed page. Tap Done and close Safari.
* Step 6: Invoke Siri by holding the Home button, and say “Hi”. If Siri doesn’t respond, try again, and then try some more. Only after Siri replies and establishes a valid connection will she be usable. To me, this is the most frustrating part about the whole process, but I was able to connect successfully after a while.
* Some report that you need to reboot your device in order to connect, but I just kept retrying and it worked for me. If retries don’t work for you, try to reboot, but being that this is a tethered jailbreak, it makes the process even more time consuming.
* Note: it is not necessary to enable Siri from Settings > General > Siri. It’s already enabled by using this hack.

* While it’s entirely possible to get Siri on an older device running iOS 6 using this method, it’s hard for me to recommend for a number of reasons. The first reason is due to the fact that there are so many steps involved, but that’s not really a problem for you guys, as you’re used to tackling projects like this.

* The most obvious reason to bypass this hack is due to reliability, or lack thereof. Siri was inconsistent at best, even when I was able to connect to her with a “Hi”. During the initial 5 minute window that I was able to connect to her, everything worked as expected. Sports scores (although oddly outdated), Movie ratings, etc.
* But after leaving my iPod touch to make a sandwich, I came back to an assistant that was completely unresponsive to my requests. That’s incredibly frustrating after spending 45 minutes to a hour configuring everything. It’s not that big of a deal if you’re already jailbroken on iOS 6, but if you go through the entire process just to obtain Siri, it’s disheartening when she won’t respond.

* Lastly, there’s the whole security aspect. Connecting to a relatively unknown repo, downloading foreign files, and connecting to servers located who-knows-where. If you’re at all sensitive about your data, or performing sensitive requests via Siri, you need to take that into consideration.
* That all being said, when it works, it works decently well. I know many of you will be gung-ho about trying this out. The question is, will you?
