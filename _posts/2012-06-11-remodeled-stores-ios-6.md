* Apple didn’t have time to go into each and every new addition in iOS 6 in great detail today, so a lot of cool stuff flew under the radar. New content stores, for instance, would fall into that category.
* As previously rumored, the latest iOS update features completely remodeled iTunes, iBooks and App Stores. A change, that Apple says, will give users a “new kind of shopping experience…”
* From Apple’s iOS 6 page:
* “See the best of what’s new in music, movies, TV shows, apps and books at the top of each store’s home page. Browse with a swipe of your finger and tap to learn more. Keep track of the music, movies, and TV shows you previewed by tapping the History button, and when you’re ready, tap Buy to add something to your collection. With iCloud, your preview history is always up to date on all your devices. So you can start shopping on your iPhone and continue on your iPad. And now you can buy your favorite music, apps, and more without leaving the app you’re in.”
* We don’t know a whole lot about the new stores just yet, other than the fact that they will include deep Facebook integration. We’re currently downloading iOS 6 ourselves, so stay tuned for a full rundown.
