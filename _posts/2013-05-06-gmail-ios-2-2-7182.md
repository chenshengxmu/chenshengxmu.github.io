* Google on Monday issued a maintenance update to its Gmail client for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices, adding two welcomed new features.
* Gmail version 2.2.7182 adds support for signing out of a single account in settings. Previously, hitting the Sign Out button signed you out of all accounts at once, which was rather clunky and not very user friendly.
* The application also has a new setting which lets you specify that YouTube, Google Maps and Chrome links go directly to these native apps instead of the mobile web – of course, provided you have them installed on your device…
* You can grab the free Gmail update from the App Store.
* Unfortunately, and this is becoming annoying fast, the software still lacks a unified inbox so if you manage, say, your personal and work email in Gmail for iOS, expect a lot of switching between the two until Google fixes this omission.
* Notably, the popular Sparrow email client that Google purchased last July has had this handy feature implemented from the onset.
