* As a rule of thumb: the bigger the phone, the stronger the battery. At least, this has been the case with the vast majority of jumbo-sized Android handsets.
* And it’s easy to see why: phones with larger displays need bigger enclosures that offer more space inside for internal components such as the battery.
* Many pundits expect Apple’s iPhone 6 to exhibit a notable battery capacity boost, but a new report is now alleging that both a 4.7 and 5.5-inch handset offer a slight boost in capacity from the battery used in the iPhone 5s, presumably because Apple is adamant to retain the World’s Thinnest Smartphone crown…
* GforGames on Monday relayed Chinese media reports [Google translate] asserting that the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will have a battery that would measure anywhere between 1,800 and 1,900mAh, with the larger 5.5-inch device pack in a 2,500mAh battery.
* By comparison, both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c have a a 1,570mAh battery. The increase in battery capacity will be needed to power those larger screens with extra pixels.

* Although the rumored 2,500mAh battery inside the bigger iPhone represents a nice boost from the iPhone 5s/5c, it pales in comparison to high-end Android handsets which typically include a 3,000mAh or stronger battery.
* For example: LG’s 5.5-inch G3 has a 3,000mAh power unit inside and the 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is outfitted with a 3,200mAh battery. Of course, battery capacity isn’t everything.

* iOS is very battery friendly and iOS 8 is even more power-efficient at its core while offering new features to help identify battery-hog apps, as evidenced on the above screenshot.
* Additionally, Apple’s in-house designed A8 processor that should power new iPhones and iPads is said to primarily focus on marked improvements to power efficiency to help prolong the handset’s battery life.
* The iPhone’s battery performance is notably the subject of Samsung’s latest Galaxy S5 commercial, seen right below.

* The 60-second video likens iPhone users to wall huggers (a line Samsung actually stole from BlackBerry CEO’s remark) because the handset’s battery would run down before the end of the end of the day, forcing them to search for power outlets.
* The Samsung device has a user-replaceable battery and includes a software feature called Ultra Power Saving Mode which puts the phone in an aggressive power-saving mode after the juice level hits a threshold.
* Would you rather have a bigger screen or a stronger battery?
