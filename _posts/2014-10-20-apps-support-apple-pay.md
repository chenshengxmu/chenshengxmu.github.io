* Alongside today’s launch of Apple Pay, the App Store is featuring a running list of apps that have been updated to include support for Apple Pay purchases. These apps can accept payment on any iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2, or iPad mini 3 with iOS 8.1 installed and Apple Pay configured.

We’ve complied a list of apps, complete with links, that support Apple Pay and will be adding to it as updates are released, so check back soon.
