* Popular chat and picture messaging app Snapchat just posted a fairly significant update, bringing the application to version 5.0. The update features a handful of improvements, including a revamped user interface.
* Also included in the update, which is apparently code-named Banquo, is swipe navigation, the ability to double tap to reply to messages, in-app profiles, and more. As usual, we have the full change log after the fold…
* Version 5.0 ‘Banquo’ change log:
* From what I’ve seen so far, the update is a solid one. The noted design improvements look great, and the app feels like it runs a bit quicker and is more smooth. It’s also easier to get around in with the new swipe navigation.
* If you were already using the messaging app, the update is a no-brainer. Otherwise, I don’t think there’s anything big enough here to warrant trying it out. Anyway, you can find Snapchat 5.0 in the App Store, for free.
