* Every now and then, you may run into an issue with Final Cut Pro X where a file doesn’t successfully import. Due to this, the media that you’re working with in your project is still referencing the location where the file originally was (i.e. SD Card, Camera HDD, etc.).
* When this happens, and you try to share/export a project, you’ll receive an error message that says “This item cannot be shared while it is still referencing media on the camera.”
* To fix this problem, you’ll need to reimport your footage from the original source using the File menu. It’s fairly straightforward, but it’s not exactly obvious as to what you should do when you first encounter this issue. Inside, we’ll show you the error message and the quick fix in our brief video tutorial.

* You can tell what clips have the issue by the icon in the bottom left-hand corner of clip. If it’s an image of a camera, then that means that the file is still being referenced from the original media (i.e. SD Card).
* Step 1: Highlight the clip causing issues
* Step 2: Click File → Import → Reimport from Camera/Archive
* Step 3: Click Continue

* The missing media will be reimported, and you’ll then be able to export/share the project as you originally intended.
* This can be a frustrating error if you’re just encountering it for the first time. It basically boils down to the fact that the media never successfully imported from your camera to begin with. Once you fix that issue, you’ll be back in business.
* Have you ever encountered this error? Was this fix a help for you?
