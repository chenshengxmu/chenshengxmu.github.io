* It’s been a little over 24 hours since iOS 5 was released, and already, the jailbreak devs are putting in work. Case in point: AppsCenter, from jailbreak developer, Filippo Bigarella.
* AppsCenter is a jailbreak widget that allows you to launch apps directly from Notification Center. In fact, this can ultimately become your de facto method for launching apps.
* Take a look past the break for a video preview of AppsCenter in action…
* AppsCenter not only allows you to launch apps from Notification Center, it also includes a ton of different settings to manipulate the look and feel of the widget.
* Some of the settings include: The ability to select only certain apps, paging, hiding labels, hiding scrollbars, and apps per page.
* The tweak is still in beta; hence, it’s unavailable to the public at this time, but it should hit Cydia in the very near future.
* Do you think you’d prefer to launch your apps from Notification Center, or will you be sticking to other methods?
