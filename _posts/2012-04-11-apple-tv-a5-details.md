* Last month, Apple unveiled its third-generation Apple TV alongside its new iPad. The set top box received a handful of updates, including the ability to stream full 1080p content courtesy of its all-new A5 processor.
* While Apple claims that the ATV’s A5 is only a single core unit, the folks over at Chipworks have a different opinion. According to their findings, the chip actually has two cores and is 41% smaller than previous A5s…
* “Either Apple is only utilizing one core or they are binning parts. parts binning is a common process in semiconductors where devices are segregated (binned) based on meeting a subset of the overall requirements, in this case they could disable the “bad” core, this increases the usable die per wafer, lowering the cost.”
* The discovery is important for a number of reasons. For starters, it means lower supply costs for Apple and improved power efficiency and performance for its devices.
* But perhaps even more important, is that Chipworks believes that this new type of A5 chip may give us a peek into Apple’s future processors. Remember earlier this week, 9to5Mac reported that Apple was working on a variant of the A5X processor for its next-generation iPhone.
