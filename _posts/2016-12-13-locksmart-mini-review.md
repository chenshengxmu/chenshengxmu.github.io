* Chances are you have a thing or two that you like to keep locked away with a padlock of some sort.
* Whether you need it for a locker at school or work, or to keep a gate or shed closed at home, you can bring your padlocks up to the 21st century with the Dog and Bone LockSmart Mini, which utilizes wireless Bluetooth connectivity so you can unlock the padlock with your smartphone.
* The LockSmart Mini uses hardened stainless steel for the lock shackle and die-cast Zamak-3 zinc alloy body, making it durable and difficult to crack open without some kind of heavy duty power tools. Moreover, seals on the device protect its electronics from weather, and the coating on the outside makes it durable against shock, making it effective for outside use as well.

* A Lithium Ion battery inside the lock charges up quickly and can last up to two years or 3,000 unlocks on a single charge, whichever comes first. The lock automatically goes to sleep after a period of time to save power and is re-activated with a light button press at the bottom of the unit. When you need to charge it back up, you can use the included Micro-USB cable.
* To use the lock, you download the LockSmart app from the App Store for free and pair your iPhone with your LockSmart Mini lock:
