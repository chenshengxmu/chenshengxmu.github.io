* Facebook’s mobile iPhone and iPad application has received a quick update today, adding support for 3D Touch shortcuts on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, but not the Peek and Pop in-app features.
* Still, you can now press firmly Facebook’s icon on the Home screen for quick access to the following shortcuts: Take Photo/Video, Upload Photo/Video and Write Post.
* From what I was able to gather, Apple’s Peek and Pop 3D Touch features are not supported within the Facebook app. This edition of Facebook also includes legendary improvements for speed and reliability. The app will support iOS 9’s Live Photos before the end of the year, Apple has said.
* If you’re a fan of Facebook Messenger, the company now has a brand new, fully-featured Messenger app for the Apple Watch.
* Built on watchOS 2 technology, Messenger for Apple Watch lets you send and receive things like voice messages, Likes and stickers. In addition, you can also dictate messages and tap the Location button to quickly send out your current location.

* Messenger currently lacks 3D Touch support.
* As for Facebook-owned Instagram, it does Peek and Pop and supports Home screen shortcuts with 3D Touch.
* Do you upload photos and videos through Facebook’s mobile app on a regular basis? And if so, do your photos and footage look a little blurry? Then you should enable the option to upload media in high-definition.
* Facebook requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later. The app currently lacks a watchOS 2 app for your wrist.
* Facebook’s mobile app is localized in Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese and Zulu.
* Grab Facebook free of charge in the App Store.
