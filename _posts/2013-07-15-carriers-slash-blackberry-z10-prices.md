* In a move similar to BlackBerry’s disastrous PlayBook tablet, carriers and resellers started slashing the price of the Z10 smartphone, launched only months ago. Carriers AT&T and Verizon cut the all-touch handset to $99 from $199. Best Buy and Amazon now sell the device for $49.
* Such deep discounts are usually a tell-tale sign of lackluster response (to put it mildly). The Z10 hit US shores on March 22 with a tall order of turning the BlackBerry around and saving the once mighty Canadian vendor from oblivion…
* While discounts are commonly used to sell older devices ahead of a new product launch, the move by carriers and retailers “suggest the phone isn’t selling well,” reports the Wall Street Journal.
* Following last week’s shareholders meeting, speculation swirled that BlackBerry could be sold for scraps, prompting the start of a death watch.
* In a statement, BlackBerry defended the price cuts, calling it “the right time to adjust the price” as it took the wraps off its new Q10 handset, which offers users a real keyboard.
* The spokesman by email also told the Journal that the lower prices were “just one element of our marketing strategy” in what he termed “a very competitive landscape.”
* CEO Thorsten Heins has described the U.S. smartphone market as “ferocious.”
* Indeed, the market for smartphones nowadays seems to mostly revolve around the iOS-Android duopoly, with Microsoft fighting to become a viable #3 entrant.
