* Apple on Tuesday shared its most recent, and official, adoption rate figures for iOS 11 through its App Store dashboard webpage for developers.
* According to the official stats, iOS 11 is now installed on 52 percent of compatible devices in the wild following its official release in September of this year, as measured by App Store on November 6. iOS 10 installations have dropped to 38 percent of compatible iOS devices while older iOS editions are still powering ten percent of compatible devices in the wild.
* In other words, more than half of devices used iOS 11 a month and a half since its launch.
* By comparison, iOS 9 reached 66 percent of devices in about the same time while iOS 10 managed to power about two-thirds of active devices less than a month following its launch.
* iOS 11 released for public consumption 49 days ago on September 19.
* iOS 10 peaked at 89 percent a few days before iOS 11 officially launched. Mixpanel said iOS 11 overtook iOS 10 on October 13Â with the adoption rate pegged at 48 percent.
* Meanwhile, Android 8.0 Oreo is currently powering about 0.2 percent of active devices.
* Thoughts?
