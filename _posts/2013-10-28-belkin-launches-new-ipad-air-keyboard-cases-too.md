* One of the top accessory makers and among the leading players in the Apple accessories ecosystem, Logitech, today announced four new keyboard cases and covers designed specifically for Apple’s upcoming iPad Air.
* However, Logitech’s arch-enemy Belkin earlier telegraphed an announcement of its own. A whole bunch of new iPad Air-specific accessories are part of Belkin’s announcement, including three new Bluetooth keyboard models from Belkin’s Qode lineup, one of them apparently made from an “aircraft-grade aluminum alloy”.
* Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* Belkin last week said that three new Qode-family branded iPad Air keyboard covers are now available: the Ultimate Keyboard Case, Thin Type Keyboard Case and Slim Style Keyboard Case.
* The Qode $129.99 Ultimate Keyboard Case for iPad Air (see image top of post and below) secures your iPad Air in place for prolonged typing periods, but is also suited when watching movies and presentations, playing games and more. Belkin has added magnets to the case which hold your iPad Air in a variety of comfortable viewing angles.

* In case you were wondering (pun intended), the case is made from an aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, has a 264-hour battery, comes in black and silver and can be folded behind the device.
* The $99.99 Qode Thin Type Keyboard Case for iPad Air uses magnets to attach to the device, much like Apple’s Smart Covers. It’s also made from aluminum and has similar functions to Logitech’s Ultrathin Keyboard Cover. The accessory will be available only in silver and Belkin claims the built-in battery is good for 79 hours of use.

* The $79.99 Qode Slim Style Keyboard Case for iPad Air adds a dash of color to your accessorizing: it comes in Black, Red, Topaz, Sorbet and Purple. The built-in battery is rated for 60 hours of active use and the case’s single-hinge design with a three-position kickstand at the rear should be appealing to road warriors.
