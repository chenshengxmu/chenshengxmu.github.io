* There are already tons of different ways you can invoke the Twitter panel in iOS 5, and this is just one of the latest methods for doing so.
* QuickTweet is a Notification Center shortcut for iOS 5 that places a quick link to the compose tweet function in the bottom left-hand corner. This could be the perfect companion to IntelliScreenX’s built-in Messages+ SMS shortcut, because it’s situated directly across from it…
* QuickTweet features no settings or options to configure, just install it, and you will notice the shortcut in the bottom left-hand corner of Notification Center.
* It’s a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for jailbroken iOS 5 devices.
* Do you plan on giving it a go?
