* If you frequently use Reddit, then chances are you have the Reddit app on your iPhone or iPad for ease of access. While it’s useful for perusing the boards, it does have its shortcomings.
* To get around many of the shortcomings, a new free jailbreak tweak called Reddit Enhanced by iOS developer Tom Effects offers a bevy of new options that let you fine-tune the Reddit app to better fit your personal needs.
* To offer fair warning, this tweak comes with a hefty amount of settings. This can be considered either a good or bad thing depending on whether you like having extensive control or hate having complicated preference panes. Nevertheless, I digress…
* If you go to the Settings app after installation, you’ll find the Reddit Enhanced preferences pane, which looks simple at a first glance:

* On the other hand, when you go into the Enhancements cell, this is where things get much more complicated:

* As you can see, the options you can tinker with are extensive. Among some of the most noteworthy of the bunch are:
* From the Theme options, you can configure how the app looks. This includes, but isn’t limited to, UI skins and comment appearance options:

* While our outline doesn’t even scratch the surface of the extensive options the tweak has to offer, it does illustrate the tweak’s versatility, making it a potential fit for many Reddit users. Even if you won’t use every option that comes with this package, chances are at least one or more will be useful to you.
* Personally, I like how it lets you hide certain kinds of posts that don’t match your criteria and how you can set your own Reddit homepage for every time you launch the app; obviously, for this I’d pick /r/jailbreak because it suits my needs, but your mileage may vary.
* Reddit Enhanced only works with the official Reddit app, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store. This unfortunately means it won’t work with third-party Reddit clients, but there are some jailbreak tweaks made specifically for third-party Reddit clients if you use them, such as AntennaGIFDL, which enables you to download GIF images from Reddit via the Antenna Reddit client.
* To try the the Reddit Enhanced tweak out for yourself, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. It works with jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices that have the Reddit app installed.
