---
* JailbreakMe is the latest jailbreak method for all devices running iOS 3.1.2 or newer. Like I said before, JailbreakMe is the easiest jailbreak you will ever find but some of you asked me to write a tutorial about it.
* This guide and tutorial will show you how to use JailbreakMe to jailbreak your iPhone. Obviously, most people won’t need this tutorial because JailbreakMe is pretty straightforward.
* Step 1: Make you your iPhone is backed up in iTunes, in case something goes wrong.
* Step 2: From you iPhone, go to JailbreakMe.
* Step 3: Slide to jailbreak.
