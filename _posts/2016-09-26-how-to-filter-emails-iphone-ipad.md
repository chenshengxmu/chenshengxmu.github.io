* Starting with iOS 10, you can easily filter out the contents of any of your email inboxes from the stock Mail app on your iPhone or iPad to find what you’re looking for. You no longer have to sort through your inbox by yourself, which is a real pain when you receive a ton of emails.
* To filter an inbox in the Mail app, launch the app from your Home screen and open one of your inboxes. You can use any of your individual email inboxes, or you can use the unified inbox that shows content from all of your email accounts if you choose to.

* To do that, tap in the middle of the bottom bar in the app that says “Filtered by:” and you will be presented with even more filtering options:
