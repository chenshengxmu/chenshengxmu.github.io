* Google held a media event today in São Paulo, Brazil, revealing that its messaging app Allo, which debuted last September, has gained a pair of new features: file sharing in group chats and support for the app’s Smart Smiley feature in Portuguese. Noting a lot of users have requested the ability to share documents in group chats, Google said that Android users everywhere can now share documents with friends on Allo, including files like PDF documents, ZIP archives, MP3 tracks and more.
* Google didn’t say when file sharing might hit Allo for iOS, but it shouldn’t be too long.
* Users in Brazil can now take advantage of the app’s Smart Smiley feature in Portuguese.

* Smart Smiley uses machine learning to help you find the perfect emoji.
* Like Apple’s tap-to-emojify feature in the stock Messages app on iOS 10, Google’s implementation requires you to tap the Smart Smiley icon on the compose bar. Like magic, Allo suggests relevant emojis and stickers to help you finish your thought.
