* Apple is planning to launch its Apple Watch within the next month or two, according to a new report from 9to5Mac. The site’s Mark Gurman says that the company is finishing up work on the wearable’s software, and sources familiar with the project say it’s on track to begin shipping in the US by the end of March.
* Apple has been fairly vague about the launch date for its highly anticipated smartwatch thus far, saying only that it would be available in “early 2015.” The firm’s retail chief Angela Ahrendts narrowed the window a bit further in November, telling employees in a video message that it’d be arriving in the “spring.”
* Gurman cautions that unexpected issues in software development or manufacturing could push the Watch to a later date, but right now the plan is March. Apple is planning to begin an “extensive testing program” in February to familiarize Apple retail employees with the new product—or really product category.
* Unveiled in September, the Apple Watch has a built-in heart rate sensor, and is capable of connecting to iOS devices to facilitate a wide variety of functions including interactive push notifications and activity tracking. The watch will come in three models: Sport, Standard and Edition, with prices starting at $349.
