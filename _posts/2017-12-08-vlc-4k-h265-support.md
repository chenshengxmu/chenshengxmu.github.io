* VLC, the popular cross-platform media player, was updated on App Store this morning with support for the native OLED display resolution on iPhone X and the ability to play 4K video encoded in the High Efficiency Video Coding standard (the H.265 codec).
* Aside from the adjusted user interface for Apple’s OLED phone and full support for H.265-encoded 4K video files, VLC for Phone and iPad version 2.8.6 includes general bug fixes while fixing the app termination issue on devices with iOS 7 and iOS 8.
* Apple began introducing support for the industry-standard H.265 codec (great for encoding 4K and high frame rate video at half the file size of the H.264 codec) on iPhone, iPad and Mac with the release of iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra.
* TUTORIAL: How to choose between H.264/JPG and H.265/HEIF media formats in iOS 11
* Many apps were refreshed recently with edge-to-edge OLED display support on iPhone X.
* Some of the notable ones are Gmail, Google Maps, the dedicated Google search app, Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp Messenger, Tidal, Feedly, PlayStation Vue and Bank of America, to name just a few.
* iDownloadBlog’s own iPhone app picked up iPhone X support this morning.
* The VLC app for iPhone and iPad includes components for Apple Watch and Apple TV, too, and supports iOS’s iPad multitasking features like Slide Over and Split View.
* VLC is available at no charge from App Store.
