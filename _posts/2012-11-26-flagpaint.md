* Cydia tends to go through phases as far as innovative jailbreak tweaks go. Sometimes there seems to be an abundance of new tweaks gracing the store every day, and other times it seems like the dry spells never end.
* In my opinion, we’re in the middle of one of those dry spells. That’s not to say there aren’t a few jailbreak tweaks here and there seeking to do something innovative, it just means that such releases seem to be few and far between.
* FlagPaint falls firmly in the category of innovative. Rather that duplicate functionality that’s already available on Cydia, the developer of FlagPaint sought out to do something original. Take a look inside for the details…
* FlagPaint tints incoming banner notification backgrounds to match the color of the app icon responsible for said notification. For instance, if you receive a banner from Tweetbot, then the banner notification will be tinted blue. That’s because the app icon for Tweetbot is blue. Pretty innovative, no?
* Along with tinting, there are also options to enable semi-transparency, remove the app icon from the banner, center text, and change fade in parameters. These are nice auxiliary features to have at your disposal, but the primary reason to try FlagPaint is for the banner tinting capabilities.
* It’s not everyday that we get a new tweak on Cydia that does something original like this, and for that reason I think FlagPaint is worth your consideration. At only $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, I recommend checking it out. What say you?
