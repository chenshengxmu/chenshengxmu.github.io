* According to a report from The Music Void, Apple will be re-launching MobileMe this April, alongside a new, cloud-based music “locker.” MobileMe will most likely be a free service, but The Music Void claims this new locker service will cost $20 a year.
* The streaming locker service would have to tie into the iTunes backend, and users would be able to stream content between iDevices and the desktop. No specific details have been leaked about the locker in the sky, but The Music Void says Apple has already been hounding record labels for the rights to stream their content…
* “Apple is reportedly pushing hard to re-launch their new and improved MobileMe service this April, but what hasn’t been mentioned is that they’re pressuring major record labels to have all of the music licenses in place for the long rumored locker service planned for launch at the same time.
* Informed sources say that Apple has sealed its deal with Warner and has been using that agreement to leverage the other labels to get the deals done in time for the April launch. The locker service will reportedly have somewhere around a $20 annual price tag.”
* We’ve already heard that Apple is planning on another media announcement for this April, and that MobileMe will be receiving a significant revamp soon. Most likely, Apple will hold some type of event this April that previews iOS 5 and re-launches MobileMe.
* You can’t currently purchase MobileMe online or in Apple retail stores, and the current 60-day trial period will be ending soon. Next month sounds very promising for an Apple event.
* Apple bought a music streaming service, called Lala, months ago. Previous reports have confirmed that Apple is working on a cloud-based service for iTunes. And Apple has already patented the “safe deposit box” concept.
* We’ll most likely see a music streaming service from Apple next month.
* Would you pay $20 for a cloud-based music locker from Apple? Would it be worth it if MobileMe synced your music across all your devices wirelessly?
