* I’ll admit that I’ve never used a Gevey SIM interposer, or anything like it in the past, but I figured I’d give it a shot with the iPhone 4S.
* The iPhone 4S has its own special SIM interposer called the R-SIM II Ultra S, which was recently released.
* I’m happy to report that this is by far the easiest method for “unlocking” your iPhone 4S, and using it with T-Mobile or virtually any other GSM carrier. And guess what, no jailbreak is required.
* Check out our review of the iPhone 4S R-SIM tool inside…
* Step 1: Remove your SIM tray from your iPhone 4S.
* Step 2: Place the R-SIM in the holder that comes with it, and place your SIM card from your desired GSM provider on top of the R-SIM.
* Step 3: Place the combined SIM tray and R-SIM + SIM card in your iPhone 4S and wait until you see the carrier name for the SIM card you wish to use.
* Since there’s currently no version of UltraSn0w that works with jailbroken iPhone 4S’ unlocking options aren’t nearly as plentiful as they have been on pre-4S devices.
* The R-SIM is by far your best bet for using your factory locked iPhone 4S on other carriers outside of purchasing a factory unlocked phone.
* What’s even better is that no 112 dialing is required. It’s literally a plug and play device.
* That was one of my stipulations before even attempting to use this device — I didn’t want to dial 112 and call emergency services unnecessarily. That’s just inconsiderate in my opinion, especially when there are people who are calling that service in dire need of assistance.
* Unbeknownst to me, the first device they sent to me did require you to dial 112. In fact, I tweeted about it when it first arrived, but as you can see, I never reviewed it. That’s because I kindly told them that I wasn’t willing to review the device if it used 112.
* Thankfully, they contacted me and stated that version 2 of the device was just released, and they would be sending it my way. Version 2, as it turns out, requires no 112 dialing.
* So that is why you see this video review today, as I just received version 2, and I’m happy to report that it works just as advertised.
* Thanks to Jason over at Each Supplier for working with me and my interesting demands. You can purchase your own R-SIM at Each Supplier’s website.
* Let me know what you think. Would you consider taking this route to unlock your iPhone 4S for use with other carriers?
