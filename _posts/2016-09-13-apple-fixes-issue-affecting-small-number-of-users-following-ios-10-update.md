* Apple released iOS 10 to the public Tuesday afternoon, and as you can imagine, many people raced to download the update as soon as it came out.
* Unfortunately, it didn’t go as smoothly for some people and left many people with error messages preventing them from using their devices.
* The problem affected a secluded number of those who updated with the over-the-air mechanism from Settings > General > Software Update on various kinds of iOS devices this afternoon.
* After the installation was expected to be completed, these users were finding themselves stuck in recovery mode.
* On the other hand, things are looking up as Apple has confirmed in a public statement that the problem was only related to a brief hiccup in the roll-out process of the update, and was fixed shortly after.
* We experienced a brief issue with the software update process, affecting a small number of users during the first hour of availability. The problem was quickly resolved and we apologize to those customers. Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare for help.
* The glitch only affected a small amount of people who were downloading the update within the first hour iOS 10 was released, but it was easily fixed by restoring the device through iTunes. This means anyone updating now shouldn’t experience this problem. Apple hasn’t released the specific details about what caused the problem, however.
* If you followed our preparatory post for how to prepare your device for iOS 10, then you already have a backup of your device that you can restore to to get all of your documents and settings right back where they were prior to the update should any issues arise for you.
* If you installed iOS 10 already, did you have any issues? Let us know in the comments below!
