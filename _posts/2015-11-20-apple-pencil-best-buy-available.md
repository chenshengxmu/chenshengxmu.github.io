* The Apple Pencil is now available for online order at Best Buy, and you can get it delivered Monday, if you act fast. There are three delivery options that I see: December 2nd with free shipping, or expedited or express shipping that will have the Apple Pencil at your door by early next week. If you’ve been looking for an Apple Pencil, you should head over to Best Buy today, and get your order in fast.
* I got my order in and chose expedited delivery. As such, my Apple Pencil should arrive on Tuesday, November 24th. If you’re an iPad Pro owner, have you been able to snag an Apple Pencil yet? If not, will you order from Best Buy?
