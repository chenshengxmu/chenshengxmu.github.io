* Good news, since I know nearly all of you will be lining up in the morning to lay claim to a white iPhone 4. I kid, I kid.
* Nevertheless, there’s a bit of good news coming out of the Twitter-sphere this afternoon, and it’s regarding the vulnerability of the white iPhone 4.
* The question people have been wondering is this: Will the iPhone 4 be vulnerable to a jailbreak out of the box tomorrow? Renowned iPhone hacker @chronic gives the answer inside…

* The apparent answer to that question, according to the fine bunch of hackers on Twitter, is yes; you should be able to jailbreak your white iPhone 4 as soon as you bring it home from the store tomorrow.
* This is highly indicative that the white iPhone 4 will come preloaded with iOS 4.3.2, a firmware version that has already been successfully jailbroken.
* Even better is the fact that the current iOS 4.3.2 jailbreaks are untethered jailbreaks, so you get the real business from day one. As always, you can find our full list of jailbreak tutorials here.
* Nice, huh? So who’s lining up with me in the morning?
