* Our youngest audience may be totally oblivious to this, but back when hipsters were not cool yet and way before Facebook-owned Instagram and Twitter-owned Vine made mobile photo and video sharing popular, there was Hipstamatic.
* And just when you thought that Hipstamatic has given up on mobile photography, the photo editing pioneer is back with a new video sharing app called Cinamatic.
* It’s available now for $1.99 in the App Store, here’s what it brings to the table…
* Like Twitter’s and Facebook’s photo and video sharing apps, Cinamatic is designed to make it easy to record short clips and share them with your Instagram, Vine or Facebook contacts.
* The app limits your video recordings to up to fifteen seconds and includes five built-in live video filters to boost your footage, with additional ones available via In-App Purchases costing between 99 cents for individual filters and $3.99 for the Starter Pack.
* “When it comes to video filters, color grading footage just isn’t enough to make a clip interesting, unlike photo filters,” Hipstamatic founder Lucas Buick tells TechCrunch.

* On the app’s rendering engine:
* The basics of our processing engine is reading the time of each clip recorded and building upon the transitions between clips.
* For example, if you record for more than five seconds continuously, the engine looks for something interesting in the clip to build a special effect from.
* Check out the below videos of Cinamatic in action.
* Grab Cinamatic for $1.99 in the App Store.
* The app is iPhone-only and iOS 7.0 or later is mandatory. It’s been optimized for the iPhone 5s’s 64-bit A7 chip and even though you can us it on the iPhone 4 and higher, Cinamatic runs best on the iPhone 5/5s/5c.
* If you’re into iPhone photography, you should check out Hipstamatic’s other apps, the $1.99 Hipstamatic and the free Hpstamatic Oggl.
