* Apple announced iOS in the Car at WWDC in June of last year. The company said that the new feature will allow iOS 7 device users to connect to the in-car displays of compatible vehicles, and that it would be launching it in the near future.
* But here we are, roughly 6 months later, and while we’ve seen photos and videos of it in action, we have yet to see any sign of a public iOS in the Car release. So what’s the holdup? A new report attributes the delay to ‘organizational issues.’

* Here’s AppleInsider passing along a report from The Information:
* “Apple executives “didn’t quite know what to do” with the iOS in the Car program, according to The Information’s Jessica E. Lessin. The disconnect is attributed primarily to overarching organizational issues that are said to place pressure on non-hardware products that do not fit within existing teams.
* Even in the lead-up to iOS in the Car’s high-profile unveiling at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference last June, executives were reportedly still unsure about the product’s future. The iOS in the Car group was forced to “lobby hard” for stage time, sources told the publication.”
* Since it was first introduced at WWDC, Apple has listed iOS in the Car as an iOS 7 feature ‘coming soon.’ A number of auto-makers have pledged support for the feature, but thus far only the company’s Siri Eyes Free has made it into vehicles.
* It’s believed that iOS in the Car could finally make its debut alongside iOS 7.1, the next major update planned for Apple’s mobile OS. There’s been no word on when the firmware will be released to the public, but it’s in its fourth developer beta.
