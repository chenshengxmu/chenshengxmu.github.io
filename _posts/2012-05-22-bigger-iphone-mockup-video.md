* With the Wall Street Journal having lent its aura of credibility to the bigger iPhone meme, it’s mockup time ladies and gentlemen.
* Introducing a brand new iPhone 5 concept design by Isaac Royo that explores a 3.95-inch display 9to5Mac heard Apple’s been testing out on prototype units of the next iPhone…
* Bragging rights for spotting this one belong to French site NowhereElse.
* We kinda love the retroilluminated home button and a miniature Thunderbolt connection replacing the 30-pin iPod dock connector for ultra-fast data transfer speeds.
* He’s also calling for 3D sound (meh), 4G LTE connectivity (provided Qualcomm solves chip shortages ), a 12-megapixel camera on the back (Sony has the right CMOS sensor), iOS 6 (you can bet on it), a FaceTime HD camera out the front (makes sense on high-speed LTE connections), a variant of the A5X chip (the rumor-mill concurs) and something called the Retina HD display (not very likely, unless Apple screws developers by adopting a native 1,280-by-720 pixel resolution display).
* Per Royo’s YouTube video description, he used Cinema 4D to create a 3D model of the handset along with textures. Video editing was done in Premiere Pro CS6 and After Effects CS6 and the obligatory Photoshop CS6 took care of image editing.
* What’s with the weird bezel, by the way?
* Am I seeing things or does that hideous thing looks as if someone slipped an iPhone 4 into a fugly bumper case of sorts?
* Oh, and if you’re torn over the taller iPhone issue as us here at iDB, feel free to take our poll and let us help figure out which screen size should be the new gold standard for iPhones.
