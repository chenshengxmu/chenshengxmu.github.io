* Modern Combat 5, meet iPhone 6. Gameloft has just posted an update for the latest edition of its popular first-person shooter franchise, Modern Combat, with support for the larger displays found in Apple’s new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets.
* Even casual gamers will immediately notice the difference after updating. Since Modern Combat 5 now supports the higher resolutions of the larger displays, it no longer has to upscale images, meaning graphics appear much cleaner and sharper.

* As the site points out, the difference probably isn’t as notable for iPhone 6 users, as there wasn’t a huge jump in resolution there. But for iPhone 6 Plus-carrying Modern Combat players, today’s update makes a huge difference in the game’s visuals.
* Combine this with the iOS 8 Metal-update MC5 received earlier this month, and you have one of the best-looking games on mobile. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend checking out Modern Combat 5: Blackout in the App Store. It’s $6.99.
