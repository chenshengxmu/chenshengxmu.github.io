* Following the backlash coming from the whole jailbreak community for bundling TaiG to their evasi0n7 jailbreak, the evad3rs have decided to turn on the kill switch for this highly controversial feature in order to deactivate it while they investigate the piracy claims.
* Earlier today, the evad3rs came forward acknowledging having inked a financial deal with Chinese installer TaiG. According to evad3rs, the agreement clearly required TaiG not to facilitate piracy, which turned out to be closer to wishful thinking than actual binding terms…
* Apparently, TaiG didn’t respect its part of the deal as there were several reports from various sources about default repos clearly offering cracked and pirated apps to its users. Chpwn, for example, saw his entire catalog of tweaks offered as cracked versions in a default repo of TaiG.
* In a tweet sent a few minutes ago, pod2g announced that the evad3rs have decided to remotely disable the default installation of TaiG in China until they can look further into the piracy claims. It’s actually good to know that TaiG installation can remotely be killed instead of requiring a repackaging of the evasi0n7 software.
* As we discussed on the latest episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak (to be available soon), I believe evad3rs had the best intention when partnering with TaiG, but they might have been played by this company from which we don’t know much, if anything.
* But is it already too late?
* It’s not necessarily too late to fix the mistake, but it might be too late for the evad3rs to regain the trust they might have lost from some jailbreak users.
* What do you think?
