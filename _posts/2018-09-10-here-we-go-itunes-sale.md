* Heads up iTunes users! PayPal has once again activated its popular iTunes gift card discount via its Digital Gifts outlet on eBay. This means that while supplies last, you can snag a $100 iTunes gift card for just $85—a solid savings of 15%.
* The gift cards are digital, delivered via email, so there’s no waiting around for a physical card to ship. Simply visit PayPal’s eBay store, purchase the card, and you should receive a redeemable promo code in your email inbox within minutes.
* Of course iTunes Gift cards can be used towards any iTunes content including apps, games, books and movies. I always pick up at least one when they go on sale (or sometimes two) to put towards my Apple Music and Netflix subscription fees.
* Buy for $85  $100
* Don’t wait, they usually run out of these discounted cards pretty quick!
