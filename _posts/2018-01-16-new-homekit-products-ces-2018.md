* CES 2018 has brought many new goodies for Apple fans, but one of the most prolific categories has been HomeKit. We saw more than a dozen new HomeKit products debut here, and we rounded them all up into one place.
* 2018 will bring new HomeKit accessories in all categories, including several new cameras, new buttons and switches, and many faucets.
* Check out the video to see them all for yourself, or peruse the list.

* Orbit has announced they are bringing HomeKit support to their B-Hyve watering systems. It will first be coming to the B-Hyve Smart Hose Faucet Timer and the B-Hyve Indoor Watering System.
* The timer and hub will be available throughout the US and Canada this January for $69.99.
* Elgato has added two products to their Eve lineup. An updated version of the Eve Room, and the new Eve Button.

* The Eve Room 2 has a new aluminum body and an e-ink display, while also ditching the AA batteries.
* The Eve Button allows you to easily control lights and scenes with the press of a button. Instead of replacing a wall switch, these are movable and have up to three different functions built into them. A single press, a double press, and a long hold.
* Kohler introduced their new Kohler Konnect program that brings HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant to several of their smart home products.
* The first pair of products to support HomeKit include the Kohler Konnect Sensate Faucet and the Kohler Konnect DTV+ Shower System.
* The faucet lets you dispense precise amounts of water on your command, and the shower system allows you to set different shower scenes with your lights, temperatures, and more. How handy will it be to tell Siri to start warming up the shower for you?
* Similar to the DTV+ Shower System, HomeKit will be coming to the U by Moen Smart Shower System.

* Each user can have their own profile, and you can use Siri and HomeKit to set scenes and control the water/temperature.
* Nanoleaf’s got a pair of new products set to debut throughout 2018.
* The first is the Nanoleaf Remote. This 12-sided dodecahedron is capable of controlling your Nanolead lights. You can twist it clockwise/counterclockwise to increase/decrease the brightness, or switch sides to change the light patterns.
* What’s more, since it works with HomeKit, you an use it to trigger any HomeKit scenes you’ve got configured. So that could be your morning scene that opens the garage, raises the blinds, adjusts your thermostat, starts your shower, makes your coffee, and turns the lights on, or any others.
* The second is their next generation lighting panel.
* These are now square shaped, and touch sensitive. You can press on them to turn them on with a variety of different effects. This new technology will also be coming to their next iteration on the popular Aurora triangle shaped lighting panels.
* Koogeek has added a new LED lightship to their lineup.
* It can change to millions of colors, and is extendable if you’d like some extra length.
* Unlike others, it also has a handy button on the relatively small controller module to turn on and off without your phone.
* It is actually available now, though appears out of stock on Amazon.
* Abode has released a new version of the Iota Camera with HomeKit built in, and will retroactively be adding it to their previous Iotas already in customer’s hands.
* It has Z-wave, Zigbee, and Abode RF built in to work with a variety of other smart home platforms and accessories. What is really useful, is it can work with a SIM card, and the integrated backup battery to still stream footage even when you lose power.
* The iota will be available in the first quarter of 2018 for $329.
* The new Belkin WeMo Bridge will bring HomeKit support to the variety of WeMo sensors already on the market. This was announced by Belkin some time ago, but it is now finally available.

* It is already out, and available on Amazon for $39.99 for WeMo users.
* Philips has announced two new pieces of information for Hue users.
* First, they will be working with Razer for new lighting features for Hue. Second, they will be introducing the Hue Entertainment app for your computer. This will allow you to sync whatever is your screen to your Hue lights.
* ConnectSense has updated their fine SmartOutlet to version 2 at CES, bringing with it more reliability, easier remote access, and support for other virtual assistants.

* They’ve also announced a new in-wall outlet to make your smart home more seamless, and less reliant on external adapters.
* Pricing hasn’t been announced, but they are looking to undercut their competitors like iDevices and Elgato, and are targeting a Q3 release this year.
* The Button from Fibaro was announced at CES, bringing multi-scene control to this adorable button.
* It comes in several different colors, and has a delightful retro look. It is battery-powered so it can be hooked up anywhere.
* If you prefer other home platforms, the Z-wave version has up to 7 commands, above the 3 allotted for HomeKit.
* It will start shipping in Q1 of this year for $59.99.
* Netatmo’s quartet of HomeKit devices includes a smart outdoor camera and light, a smoke detector, a radiator valve, and a thermostat.
* The smoke detector was actually announced last year, but has been met with delays. It is finally ready for primetime and will be released soon.

* The radiator valve and thermostat also seem to have been around for a little while now and have a similar design aesthetic to one another.
* The outdoor spotlight cam is relatively new and started supporting HomeKit just a few weeks ago according to the Netatmo rep I spoke to.
* It has a light, as well as a camera, and the camera uses AI to discern between people, pets, etc. We saw a demo of this out at CES and it looked very cool and accurate when detecting people. It also has free storage using the built in SD, dropbox, or your own FTP server.
* The outdoor camera joins their other indoor HomeKit camera.
* If locks are more your speed, Brinks has you covered. They’ve announced pre-order of the Smart Deadbolt, as well as the introduction of the ARRAY Chek lock.

* They’ve also previewed the Smart Light that has a camera built in as well.
* The Smart Deadbolt is slated for the first half of 2018 for $249, while the rest is expected “sometime” in 2018.
* What may turn out to be my favorite HomeKit product of 2018 is the OneLink Safe & Sound from First Alert.
* This combo smoke and carbon monoxide sensor also includes a premium AirPlay 2 speaker. HomeKit support is included for both sensors, as well as the subtle color LED light that makes it easy to light up hallways at night.
* If that wasn’t enough, it has built-in microphones and Amazon’s Alexa. You can literally speak to the smoke detector to control your home, or any other Alexa functions.
* When released, it will retail for $249.
* iDevices has announced a pair of new HomeKit switches for 2018.
* The first is a smart ceiling fan switch, that was developed in partnership with their new parent company, Hubble.
* Second, the cooler product, is the iDevices Instinct switch. It works as a HomeKit switch, but also has a built-in speaker/microphone set to support Amazon Alexa.
* Like the Safe and Sound, you can speak to Alexa for a variety of different functions.
* Both products are set to be released this year, though no pricing or date has been announced.

* HomeKit will also be coming to Netgear’s line of Arlo baby cameras.
* Aside from just being a camera, they have several other sensors baked in, and many adorable outfits to make them more kid friendly.
* Fortunately, it will be coming to previous models through a firmware update, so there is no need to pick up a new one.
* They are currently available on Amazon for $235.
* iCreation is a new company in the HomeKit world. They have a whole new lineup of homeKit products set to debut in waves, starting with their smart outlet.
* It is worth noting that their products do require a bridge, so if that is a dealbreaker, I’d say keep looking.
* Their full lineup includes a wall switch, outlet, motion sensor, water sensor, contact sensor, temperature sensor, smoke detector, carbon monoxide sensor, and two separate locks.
* Their first products are set to hit shelves early this year.
* That brings us to the end of our HomeKit product list from CES 2018. There is well over two dozen HomeKit accessories ready to hit the market throughout this year, and we are happy to be covering them.

* It is an exciting time to be scouting new HomeKit accessories, and I’m sure more products will be unveiled throughout the year. This seems to be the year that HomeKit hits its stride with a record number of new products on the horizon.
* It remains to be seen for sure, but right now, I think I am most looking forward to the Safe + Sound from First Alert, as it appears to be a truly unique product we haven’t seen in the past. Plus, it is one of few AirPlay 2 speakers ready to hit the market!
* Let me know which of the new products is your new favorite, down in the comments.
