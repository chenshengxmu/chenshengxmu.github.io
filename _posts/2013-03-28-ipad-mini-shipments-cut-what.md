* There’s a new report out of China this morning, claiming that Apple is cutting shipments of its iPad mini next month. The cut is said to be a 20% reduction, with steeper cuts likely happening in the latter part of the second quarter.
* While the folks on Wall Street will probably try to spin this into an ‘Apple is doomed’ story, despite the fact that there’s evidence that the mini is selling very well, the consensus seems to be that it’s preparing to launch a new model…
* Here’s the DigiTimes report (via MacRumors):
* “Apple has reportedly cut its shipments of the iPad mini to between 10-12 million units for the second quarter of 2013, according to industry sources. The figure is based on shipment information given from multiple sources who provide various components for Apple’s iPad mini.
* The decrease may be as high as 20% on month during April, the sources noted, and may continue to slightly decrease throughout the quarter to bring total shipments of the iPad mini to as low as 10 million units during the quarter.”
* The outlet goes on to say that the cuts come as Apple is adjusting its reserves for the next-generation iPad mini, which its sources believe will be out in the third quarter of this year. So sometime between July, and the end of September.
* And that timeframe matches up perfectly with KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a great track record in recent years, who believes that the second-gen mini will launch alongside the iPad 5, and perhaps a new iPhone, in Q3.
* It’s also worth noting that Apple hasn’t held a media event yet this year, which is really kind of odd. So it wouldn’t surprise anyone, I don’t think, if we saw something from the Cupertino company at some point in the next few months.
* As for the mini itself, we don’t know much about it other than that it’s expected to feature a Retina display. But many critics don’t think Apple can do that and keep the tablet the same size and price. So it certainly has its work cut out for it.
