* Apple TV defaults to using a light typeface throughout the tvOS interface. If your vision is not as it used to be, light typeface makes the text difficult to distinguish from background shading , even if your box is hooked up to a really big screen TVs.
* To help with that, the Apple TV software provides an option to use a much heavier font making the text easier to read throughout the tvOS interface, here’s how.
* Before we get to it, we should point out that this nifty little feature is supported on any Apple TV model from the fourth-generation model onward.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your Apple TV.
* 2) Navigate to General → Accessibility.
* 3) Highlight the Bold Text option underneath the Interface heading, then press the Touch surface on your Siri Remote.

* 4) A message pops up, saying enabling the bold text option will require a restart.

* Click Continue if you’d like to enable this option or Cancel to abort the operation.

* With the bold text option turned on, tvOS replaces the light San Francisco typeface with a lot heavier variant across the interface, including places like the Settings app, your Apple TV Home screen and other places where text is displayed.

* The Settings app with the bold text option enabled
* If you don’t have 20/20 vision or simply find the light San Francisco font ineligible, especially against darker backgrounds, go bold for easy-to-read text.
* Do you have difficulty discerning if a Home screen icon is selected or not? If so, how about putting a nice glow effect around tvOS’s selection rectangle by enabling a high-contract cursor?
* To tune this handy feature on, navigate to Settings → General → Accessibility → Increase Contrast, then set the Focus Style option to High Contrast.

* Now go back to the Home screen and you’ll notice a thick white outline surrounding the selection cursor. Not only does it make the currently selected icon stand out better, but helps you navigate the interface faster as well.
