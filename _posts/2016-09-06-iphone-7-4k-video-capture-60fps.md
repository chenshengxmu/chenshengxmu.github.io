* The iPhone 6s series brought the biggest camera jump so far, with the front shooter upgraded to a five-megapixel lens and the rear one going from eight to twelve megapixels with the ability to capture 4K video at thirty frames per second (FPS). Aside from other changes in the camera department, the next iPhone is said to double the frame rate for 4K recordings, letting you capture action at a silky smooth 60 FPS, according to a Vietnamese site that has allegedly used a real iPhone 7.
* Current iPhones can capture video at 60 FPS, but only in 1080p resolution.
* This rumored new feature should be available to all iPhone 7 owners as the site claims that both the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and the dual-lens 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus are capable of capturing 4K video at 60 FPS.
* If true, the iPhone 7 will be the first smartphone capable of shooting 4K video at 60 FPS. The decision to double the maximum storage on the iPhone 7 series from 128 GB to 256 GB and add a a new 2TB tier to iCloud may have something to do with this rumor.
* You’re probably aware that 4K videos take up a significant amount of storage so doubling the frame rate will result in even bigger files. Of course, users will be able to adjust their video capture resolution and frame rate in camera settings.
* Other things we gleaned from the report:
* As you know, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone 7 would have improved IPX7 water resistance, matching the Apple Watch’s level of waterproofing. Tinthe.vn did not provide any photographic evidence to substantiate its claims so take their report with a grain of salt.
