* Apple on Tuesday seeded to members of the Apple Developer Program a second beta of iOS 10.2 and a second beta of what would become the third major update to macOS Sierra. iOS 10.2.1 beta 2 (build 14D15) and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 2 (build 16D17a) are now available to install over-the-air via Settings → General → Software Update on iOS devices and under the Mac App Store’s Updates tab on the Mac.
* The latest betas are also available for download through Apple’s Developer Center. Both iOS 10.2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 should be shortly available for public beta testers enrolled in Apple Beta Software Program.
* We will update the article with any outward-facing new features discovered in iOS 10.2 beta 2 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 2 if and when we encounter them.
