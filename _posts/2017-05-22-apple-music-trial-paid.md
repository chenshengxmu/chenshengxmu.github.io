* If you live in Australia, Spain or Switzerland, you can no longer try out Apple Music for three months for free. In those countries, Apple Music’s three-month trial now requires a small payment. In Australia, three months of Apple Music is now AUD 0.99. In Spain, Apple Music trial is now a € 0,99 value and in Switzerland it comes in at SFR 0.99.
* The trial was still free in those countries as of May 14, according to The Verge. In an email statement to the publication, Apple said: “Pricing and promotions for Apple Music vary from country to country.”
* AppleInsider thinks the move may have something to do with Apple trying to recover some of those costs with paid trial periods.

* In all other countries, Apple Music’s three-month trial remains available at no charge.
* Apple Music lunched in 2015 with a fairly generous three-month free trial allowing customers to try the service before paying a monthly subscription.
* It’s interesting that rival Spotify also does not offer a free trial in Australia, Spain and Switzerland, charging the same fee for three months of its service in those markets.
* On the other hand, Spotify’s trial costs 99 cents elsewhere, too, including in the US and Canada.
