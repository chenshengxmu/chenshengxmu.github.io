* Apple has taken the wraps off the new Music app design on Apple Watch coming this fall. It looks to do away with the sometimes cumbersome, manual iPhone to Apple Watch synchronisation process of playlists, and instead promises automatic syncing based on what you like to listen to on your iPhone.
* As a result, your favorite playlists and most frequently played tunes (including My New Music Mix, My Favorites Mix, Heavy Rotation, My Chill Mix) will automatically appear on Apple Watch, furthermore multiple playlists outside of those are going to be permitted as well.
* The new design seems to abandon small fonts and lettering in favor of album covers and images where possible, though we have yet to see the full extend to which the app has been overhauled. In any event, the Digital Crown was touted as the go-to button for swift and effective music selection on your wrist.
