* Documentarian and movie director Kenneth Lauren “Ken” Burns is well-known for his style of using archival footage and photographs and giving them life by slowly zooming in on subjects of interest and panning from one subject to another.
* This technique became known as ‘The Ken Burns effect’ and you’ll find it in Apple’s iPhoto, iMovie and Final Cut Pro X apps and many other software applications.
* Today, Ken’s out with a new namesake iPad app, now available free in the App Store, which gives you access to streaming videos containing extras, behind-the-scenes and other footage from all 25 of his films, such as The Civil War, Baseball and Prohibition…
* “This app is not a collection of Ken’s filmography,” according to release notes. “It’s an entirely new way of looking at American history,” and it’s only available on iPad.
* The app basically provides curated access to a collage of footage from Ken’s cherry-picked films illustrating recurring themes in American history: Race, War, Art, Hard Times, Innovation and Politics.
* Your Retina screen is used to the fullest so all videos look fantastic.
* There are three main views in the app:

* I like that he praised the Mac and Apple in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:
* Apple has long used an element of my filmmaking in its programs, which they call the Ken Burns Effect. I’m so excited to now be using Apple’s platforms to create a radically new way to present my work and reach new viewers.
* Our films are made in a small town in New Hampshire over many years, with images and stories woven together in a way that we hope brings experiences of the past into the present.
* And here’s Burns discussing the digitization of media on Bloomberg Television’s ‘Bloomberg Surveillance’ show.
* Download Ken Burns free of charge in the App Store.
* The free download includes one playlist around the theme of Innovation. Five additional playlists are available as a one-time $9.99 in-app purchase.
* It’s an iPad only app and iOS 7.0 or later is required.
