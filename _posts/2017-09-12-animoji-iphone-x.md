* Apple today showed off another cool feature of iPhone X—Animoji (stop me if you’ve already heard it).

* Taking advantage of an all-new depth sensing camera system and sensors inside that notch at the top of the display (they’re calling it TrueDepth camera), iPhone X is able to pick up about fifty different muscle movements on your face and apply them to virtual 3D avatars, called Animoji.

* The way it works, you just tap one of the new Animoji right inside the new Messages app and just like that, the chosen Animoji animates in real-time corresponding to your facial movements.
* You can also this manipulate this in full screen and record audio messages with an accompanying looping Animoji video. Apple is also working with Snap Inc. to bring this facial tracking features with accurate tracking in real-time to the Snapchat app.
