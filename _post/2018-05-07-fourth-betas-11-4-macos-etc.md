* Apple on Monday seeded the fourth betas of iOS 11.4, macOS 10.13.5, watchOS 4.3.1 and tvOS 11.4 to developers. Registered developers can download the new betas through Apple’s dev center, or they can be installed using each platform’s respective OTA updating mechanism.
* iOS 11.4 reintroduces AirPlay 2 support, which was present in in early 11.3 betas, but pulled ahead of the public launch. It also includes Messages on iCloud and ClassKit support. macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 brings about support for Messages on iCloud, among various bug fixes.
* And that’s about it in terms of new features. Remember that Apple launched a round of updates at the end of March, and is widely expected to unveil major updates in June. As always, we’re installing today’s betas, and will be sure to report back if we find anything significant.
