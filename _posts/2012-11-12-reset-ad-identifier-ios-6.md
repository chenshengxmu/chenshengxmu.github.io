* With the release of iOS 6, Apple replaced its controversial unique device identifier system (or UDID) with the Advertising Identifier. It’s a non-permanent, non-personal, device identifier, that advertising networks use to track your behavior.
* Since its introduction, users who don’t like targeted advertisements have had the ability to limit ad tracking via a toggle in the Settings application. And in iOS 6.1, users will gain the ability to reset their Advertising Identifier as well…
* Apple seeded beta 2 of iOS 6.1 today. And among other changes, the release notes point to a new button in the Advertising section of iOS labeled Reset Advertising Identifier. It’s kind of like resetting your browser history, but for targeted ads.
* “In iOS 6.1, a new Reset Advertising Identifier button has been added to Advertising Settings. This button resets the Advertising Identifier so that future requests will return a different value.”
* It’s worth noting that the first beta of iOS 6.1 actually has this button too. It’s a nice little addition that should help keep personal ads more relevant.
* Thanks Jacob!
