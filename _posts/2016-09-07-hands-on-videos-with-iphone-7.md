* Following its big iPhone 7 event this morning, Apple gave journalists the opportunity to go hands-on with some of the new products it announced today including the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and AirPods. And as usual, we’ve rounded up some videos of these first impressions so you can get a better look at the new hardware.
* Both the Apple Watch Series 2 and iPhone 7 will be available for pre-order on September 9, and start shipping September 16, with starting prices of $369 and $649 respectively. The AirPods have a more vague “late October” launch date, and will start at $159.
