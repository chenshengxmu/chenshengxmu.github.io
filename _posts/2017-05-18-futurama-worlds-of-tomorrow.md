* Game developers FoxNext Games and Jam City (via its game studio TinyCo) announced today that Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow for iPhone and iPad will arrive sometime in early summer.
* The new game will blend simulation, combat, galactic exploration and choose-your-own-adventure mechanics together to bring the escapades of the Planet Express crew to life. In his February interview with USA Today, Matt Goering said that the game will contain some entirely new episodes of the show.
* “Oh, you guys wanna do a game? That’s fine,” he said. “But we’re gonna sneak some more Futurama episodes in there on whatever device people are gonna be using.”
* The game features two main settings: New New York, which focuses on simulation and character progression gameplay, and Space Adventures, in which players explore and battle their way through planets, nebulas and other weird stuff across the Futurama universe.
* Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow is being developed in partnership with Futurama and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and his Curiosity Company, along with executive producer David X. Cohen and original Futurama writers.
* “Jam City is working with the writers, animators, and cast to produce even more original animation that will have fans waving their tentacles in the air,” according to developers.
* The official teaser trailer embedded below is the first new animation from the Futurama universe since the show’s original TV run ended in 2013.
* “I’m proud to say that Futurama lives! In mobile-video-game teaser trailer form, anyway,” said the series’ creator Matt Groening. “If you squint, it’s kind of like a little episode!”
* “Working on this new Futurama animation has been a thrilling adventure,” said David X. Cohen.
* “I finally understand how Neil Armstrong must have felt when he first landed on the lunar surface, watched some funny cartoons on the control screen, and did whatever else was on his schedule that day,” he added, jokingly.
* In the New New York setting, your main focus will be on rescuing characters, collecting special items and materials, expanding your characters’ capabilities by leveling them up and crafting ability-defining character outfits and tackling story-driven quests.
* According to developers, events that occur in New New York will often move the game’s overarching narrative forward, by allowing players to assemble a crew of their favorite Futurama characters and take to the stars for Space Adventures.
* “While traversing the depths of space, players will fight alien enemies in retro arcade-style combat, rendered in beautiful 16-bit graphics, and explore strange lands in which their choices determine their fate,” they said.
