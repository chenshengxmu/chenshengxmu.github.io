* File this one under the ‘We Shall See’ drawer: Apple’s long-rumored MacBook Air with a 12-inch Retina display is reportedly launching next year in Space Gray and Gold, in addition to the usual aluminum silver look, A Tech Website said Friday citing sources “familiar with Apple’s plans”.
* This is the first time someone has mentioned iPhone-inspired colors with respect to Apple’s ultra-thin notebook. We’re not sure what to make of this report because in my personal view, a gold MacBook Air sounds preposterous, to say the least.
* Interestingly enough, the site adds that Apple has pushed back the release of the Retina MacBook Air “multiple times.” Back in July, Taiwan’s Economic Daily News claimed that the notebook launch was pushed back due to Intel’s next-generation Broadwell processor delays.
* The power-efficient Intel chips are believed to enable a fabless MacBook Air design and an even thinner appearance with a new buttonless trackpad.

* When you come to think of it, a gold MacBook Air is certainly viable given Apple’s borrowed the iPhone’s color scheme for its watch, which also comes in gold.
* Would you buy a Retina MacBook Air in one of the rumored iPhone-inspired colors?
