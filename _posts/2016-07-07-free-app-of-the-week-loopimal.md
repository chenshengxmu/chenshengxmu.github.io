* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the app Loopimal by Yatatoy. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to pick up the critically acclaimed children’s title for both iPhone and iPad for free—a solid savings of $3.
* Loopimal is essentially a building kit of handcrafted animations and sounds that teaches kids about music. The graphics are both sharp and charming, and the rhythmic/melodic content makes for endless possibilities of creations and compositions.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* An utterly charming way to introduce young kids to music and animation, Loopimal is simple and powerful in a way that almost defies description. Kids arrange and rearrange tiles in sequences underneath a cute polar bear, octopus, and the like, triggering a series of musical tones mirrored by adorable dances from the animal gang. There are no goals and no consequences—just a safe place to learn, play, and laugh.
* And here’s a video of the app in action:
* Loopimal is available in the App Store for free.
