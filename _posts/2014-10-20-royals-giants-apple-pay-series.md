* Folks lucky enough to be attending the World Series over the next week will be happy to hear that Apple Pay payments will be accepted at both Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City and AT&T Park in San Francisco. MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM) announced the availability this afternoon.
* In conjunction with MasterCard, MLBAM says it worked hard to bring a variety of contactless payment services and devices to the ballparks in time for the Championship series, which will allow attendees to purchase food and beverages at concession stands using their own smartphones.
* “The ballpark experience lends itself well to simple, secure payments so fans get through concessions and back to the game quickly,” said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer, MasterCard. “We’re thrilled to partner with MLBAM to bring contactless acceptance to the World Series.”
* This isn’t the first time that the MLB has experimented with new technology. Major League Baseball was on the forefront of live streaming, and it was the first pro sports organization to begin rolling out Passbook support. It was also a launch partner for Apple’s iBeacon geolocation project.
* Game 1 of the World Series is Tuesday night, in Kansas City, and it could run through Wednesday of next week, depending on the outcome. For those who won’t be able to make it to one of these games, MLBAM says that Apple Pay should be available in the At the Ballpark app by next season.
