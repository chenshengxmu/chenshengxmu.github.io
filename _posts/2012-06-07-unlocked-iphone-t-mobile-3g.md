* T-Mobile and the iPhone have a love-hate relationship. While the carrier often bashes the handset in its print ads and TV commercials, it obviously benefits from the 1 million+ unlocked iPhones on its network, and would love an official partnership.
* Why else do you think the carrier continues to speak publicly about its plans to launch a new 4G network — one that would finally allow iPhones to get 3G data speeds? Because it’s dying to show iPhone owners (and Apple) that it’s willing to play ball…
* We first saw evidence of this last December, when several iPhone users started reporting that they were seeing 3G data speeds on T-Mobile’s network. As it turns out, the carrier was “re-farming” spectrum from other networks on the iPhone-friendly 1900MHz band.
* The reports were very isolated, limited to specific areas in Nevada, Utah, and a few other states. But it looks like T-Mobile is expanding the service. A new report today from 9to5Mac claims that T-Mobile users are now seeing 3G data in parts of northern California.
* The site posted a screenshot this morning, sent in by a reader, of an obviously-unlocked iPhone running on a T-Mobile-branded 3G network. The user said that he noticed the increased data speed while walking around the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
* The question is, is this still re-farmed spectrum? Or is this part of the new 4G network T-Mobile has been talking about rolling out? 9to5Mac speculates that the carrier installed a new 1900MHz MicroCell in the area, specifically for Apple’s WWDC event next week.
* Whatever the case, it looks like T-Mobile is trying awfully hard to get Apple’s, and its horde of users’, attention.
