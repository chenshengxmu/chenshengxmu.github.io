* Despite the crazy roller coaster that the iOS 11 jailbreak department has been on lately, developers are still releasing jailbreak tweaks for customizing the iOS experience.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about this week’s noteworthy releases. As always, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites and outline the rest of them afterward.

* If you use Apple’s Notes app frequently, then customizedNotes could quickly become your new best friend.
* After you install the tweak, you’ll find a new preference pane in the Settings app for personalizing your Notes app however you might like. The tweak provides various features like full-screen mode, dark keyboard, hiding or showing app elements, and more.
* To learn more about customizedNotes and what it can do for you, we recommend reading our in-depth review.
* AutoRotate: Enables iOS 11-style autorotation of the Home screen and more (free via BigBoss repository)
* BlueTwitterTint: Tints the text in stock Twitter app blue (free via GydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* DingTalkHelper: An add-on for enhancing the DingTalk app (free via BigBoss repository)
* ReplayKit Everywhere: Record any app’s screen with or without microphone commentary (free via BigBoss repository)
* Most of these tweaks were made with iOS 10 or earlier in mind. That said, many developers are prepping their tweaks for iOS 11 since Saurik said he’d be updating Cydia and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11 shortly. In the meantime, just continue holding tight – good things come to those who wait.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks to try, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special.
