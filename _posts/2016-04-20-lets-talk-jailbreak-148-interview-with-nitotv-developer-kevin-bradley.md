* Today we have a slightly different show for you with a slightly different format. We actually have Kevin Bradley also known as nitoTV on the show. I sat down for a few minutes with Kevin and chatted a little bit about the recent Apple TV jailbreak and the release of nitoTV. I want to warn you that the sound quality is not that great. It’s actually pretty bad at times, but I hope you will enjoy this episode of LTJ nonetheless. And now, without further ado, Kevin Bradley.
