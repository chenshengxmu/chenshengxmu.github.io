* With less than three days left until the iPhone 5s/5c general availability, Apple this morning posted a reminder that both handsets are scheduled to go on sale on Friday, September 20 at 8:00am local time at Apple retail stores and at 12:01am PDT at the online Apple Store in the United States, United kingdom, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
* The company promised to release iOS 7 for public consumption on Wednesday so we think first iOS 7 and iPhone 5s/5c reviews will be hitting the web real soon. In the meantime, folks who pre-ordered Apple’s cases for the new iPhones have reported receiving their shipment early.
* And over in China, a few lucky customers who seem to have gotten their hands on the first iPhone 5s and 5c units posted photographic and video evidence of the unboxing as proof…
* MacRumors points us to what appears to be the first unboxing video of the lower-cost iPhone 5c posted by the Italian technology website HDblog.it. The clip, credited to a source at Chinese carrier China Unicom, has been posted to YouKu, which is the Chinese version of YouTube.
* You can watch it embedded below, but note it requires the Flash plug-in.
* The website also posted a bunch of unboxing photos of both the iPhone 5s (see the image top of post) and the blue iPhone 5c (below).

* No surprises here: the package contents of both new iPhones includes the EarPods headphones, a Lightning cable, a USB wall charger and Apple’s standard manual.
* So, who’s excited?
