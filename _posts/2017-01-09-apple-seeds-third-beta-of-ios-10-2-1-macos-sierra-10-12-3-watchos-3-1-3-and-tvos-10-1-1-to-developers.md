* Apple today released new OS betas to its registered developers. iOS 10.2.1 beta 3 (build 14D23), macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 3 (build 16D25a), watchOS 3.1.3 beta 2 (build 14S959) and tvOS 10.1.1 beta 2 (build 14U711) are now available for testing to the members of Apple Developer Program.
* The latest builds can be installed over-the-air via the Software Update mechanism on devices that have an appropriate configuration profile installed on them.
* The new builds have arrived nearly three weeks after a second beta of iOS 10.2.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3 released to registered developers.
* The initial betas were released on December 14, followed by beta 2 a week later. OS betas can also be installed via Apple’s Developer Center.
* We’ll update the post with any changes in the latest betas and highlight new outward-facing user features if and when they are discovered.
