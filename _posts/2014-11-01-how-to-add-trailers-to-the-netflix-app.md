* Netflix is a wonderful entertainment resource. It’s always good for an obscure move that you’ve never heard of. I highly recommend Funky Monkey.
* But one of the most baffling things about Netflix is the lack of trailers and previews. Instead, you have to exit the Netflix app, fire up YouTube, watch your trailer, and then head back to the Netflix app with decision in hand. Yeah, that makes no sense.
* Fortunately, jailbreakers no longer have to deal with that nonsense. Netflix++ is a new jailbreak tweak that integrates YouTube trailers directly into the Netflix app. That means that people like our very own Cody can watch a snippet of Justin Bieber’s movie before sitting down to enjoy it. Have a look inside for the video details…
* Once you install Netflix++ there are no options to configure. You’ll obviously need to be subscribe to Netflix so that you can log in to the app, but that’s about it. Once you open the app, you’ll see YouTube trailers neatly nestled between the movie information and the recommendations.
* If you’re a Netflix user, then Netflix++ is sort of a no-brainer. It brings some definite real-world value to the Netflix experience and can be had absolutely free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* What do you think? Are you sold on it?
