* Apple has seeded a new beta of its upcoming OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 this afternoon. The update, labeled build 14C94b, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Dev Center for all registered Mac developers.
* Today’s release comes a few weeks after the previous OS X 10.10.2 beta, and Apple has once again asked developers to focus their testing efforts on Wi-Fi connectivity—a long-standing Yosemite issue—as well as Mail and VoiceOver.
* Given that this is a minor update, we don’t expect to see any major changes outside of bug fixes. But we’re installing the beta now, and will pass along anything new of note. If you find something, e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
