* Exclusivity appears to be the name of the game concerning Apple’s rumored 5.5-inch handset. Thus far, we’ve learned that Tim Cook & Co. could distinguish Apple’s first phablet-class device with several exclusive features.
* These would presumably include (other than display size) optical image stabilization, an ultra-sharp screen at 2K resolution and multiple new sensors for measuring air pressure, temperature and humidity.
* You can now put 128GB of storage on your list of 5.5-inch iPhone 6 exclusives…
* If a new report Thursday by the Chinese blog Wei Feng [Google translate] is an indication, Apple may keep the 128GB option exclusive to the 5.5-inch handset.
* An iPhone with 128 gigabytes of storage doesn’t sound outrageous at all.
* Last year, a placeholder for such an item briefly appeared in a German retailer’s system. This in turn fueled speculation that the iPhone 5 would gain a new 128GB storage SKU. Instead, Apple went on to add a 128GB variant to the iPad lineup this February.
* And just yesterday, another Chinese outlet asserted that the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will drop the 16GB SKU and offer only two storage flavors: 32GB and 64GB.

* In this regard, adding a 128GB option to the bigger handset could serve as yet another differentiator from its 4.7-inch sibling.
* And with massive 5.5 inches of screen real estate and possibly some exclusive content creation apps (i.e. Aperture and Final Cut Pro), it’s entirely conceivable that power users would have no trouble filling up 128 gigabytes with rich media and fat apps.
* That’s especially going to be the case in light of the Super Retina screen rumor: games and apps with Retina assets will need even more storage for ultra sharp bitmaps and other assets.
* My 64 gig iPhone 5s is now packed to bursting so I’d definitely find use for a 128GB iPhone in my pocket.
* How about you?
* How much gigabytes do you comfortably need in your iPhone?
