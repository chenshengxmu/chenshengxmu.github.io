* Now that Apple has divulged fresh details concerning its first wrist-worn device, watchful bloggers (sorry about the pun) are now chewing on Watch news.
* Disregarding for a moment the dizzying array of bands at one’s disposal, the Apple Watch lineup is comprised of three different cases, provided in two sizes each. This makes choosing one which will fit your lifestyle not as straightforward as buying a new iPhone.
* Now that the most crucial piece of information has been publicized — the full Watch pricing lineup — we’re eager to learn which model you, our loyal readers, might opt for.
* As a reminder, the Apple Watch is offered in the following finishes and sizes, along with starting prices for each:
* These starting prices are based on the least expensive bands.
* Because Apple’s fashionable wearable is all about customization, prospective buyers may end up paying more depending on their preferred strap.
* Assuming you’re the target market, which baseline Watch model do you see yourself picking up? Please cast your vote below now.
* Which Apple Watch are you?
* It’s interesting that the Apple Watch Sport prices are the same regardless of a band so it doesn’t take a genius to predict this will be the most popular model. Beyond the Sport edition, you really need to factor in the differences in band prices (I’ve listed a total of 40 available sales combination in this post for your convenience).

* As mentioned above, after deciding on a case size and material, choosing a band can greatly affect the price. Here are a few examples just to give you a feel how prices of the higher-end Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition vary when customization options are considered.
* The stainless steel Apple Watch can cost anywhere between $549 and $1,049 — and that’s just for the smaller 38mm version — depending on a band.
* Another example: the entry-level 38mm Apple Watch Edition starts out at $10,000, assuming you’re content with cheapening its gold casing with a Sport band.
* If you were really going to go premium, chances are you’d be picking up a premium band to go with it. Say, the Bright Red Modern Buckle, which has gold parts. The price instantly shoots from ten grands up to a whopping $17,000.

* Complicating things further, not all bands are available standalone.
* In the case of the Link Bracelet, for example, the Stainless Steel Apple Watch is the benefactor of a special setup. A diamond-coated Space Black Link Bracelet is paired with the Space Black Stainless Steel Watch, and is not available for purchase separately.
* By the way, given a spade of news stories and tidbits surrounding the Apple Watch, surely you won’t mind me recommending our roundup post, which gives a nice summation of yesterday’s announcements.
* Please share your thoughts on choosing an Apple Watch for your lifestyle down in the comments. And do feel free to tell fellow readers what drew you to a particular model and size.
