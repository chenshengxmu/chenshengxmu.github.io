* Epic Games has announced that it’s bringing its hugely popular free-to-play multiplayer title Fortnite Battle Royale to mobile devices, including iPhone and iPad.
* Epic promises that the mobile port will have the same features, content and weekly updates as Fortnite Battle Royale for PC, Mac, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On phones and tablets, Fortnite is “the same 100-player game” you know from other platforms, according to the company.
* The game will support Cross Play and Cross Progression between PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, iOS and Android, allowing players across devices to squad up with friends and play together.
* “We believe this is the future of games. The same game on all platforms. Console quality graphics and action. Play when you want, where you want,” Epic wrote.
* You can sign-up for the invite event on iOS next Monday, March 12, at the official website. Email invites will start rolling out soon thereafter.
* If you’re invited, you’ll get friend invite codes to share with others. If you don’t receive an invite right away, be patient as they’ll be adding more players regularly over the coming months.
* The game requires an Internet connection and supports any iPhone from iPhone 6s onward, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or 2017 iPad models with iOS 11 or later.
* Are you looking forward to playing Fortnite on iOS?
