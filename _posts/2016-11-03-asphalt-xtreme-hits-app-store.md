* French games developer and publisher Gameloft today released Asphalt Xtreme, the latest installment in its popular Asphalt mobile racing franchise. If Asphalt 8: Airborne was too boring for your tastes, this new racer should get your adrenaline going and juices flowing.
* In Asphalt Xtreme you’ll be ripping around dunes, charging through canyons, drifting across the mud and flying past your opponents to reach the finish line.
* Like many, many, many premium games on the App Store, Asphalt Xtreme is a freemium download with extra features, in-game currency, optional upgrades and other items available optionally via the In-App Purchase mechanism.
* The game packs in nearly three dozen vehicles, each with its own characteristics and features, from monster trucks to American muscle cars and action vehicles like a buggy or a rally car. “Off-road vehicle types deliver unique flavors of gameplay, allowing you to constantly discover fresh and challenging experiences,” says Gameloft.
* Check out the promotional trailer for Asphalt Xtreme.
* All told, there are five different game modes to choose from, plus real-time multiplayer mode, limited-time events and more than 400 career events to complete and over 500 challenges to master. If you’re a fan of Asphalt games, don’t pass on this one.
* Like previous Asphalt titles, Xtreme makes the most from your device’s silicon so you’ll enjoy splashy graphics with smooth animations.
* Here are some highlights from release notes:
* Asphalt Xtreme requires an iPad 2 or newer, iPhone 4s or newer or a fifth-generation iPod touch or later. A network connection is required to play the game.
* Grab Asphalt Xtreme free of charge in the App Store.
