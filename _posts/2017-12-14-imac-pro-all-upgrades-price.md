* Apple started selling iMac Pro on Thursday. It starts at $4,999, but choosing absolutely every single bell and whistle available in the online store increases the computer’s price to $13,348.
* All iMac Pro models are outfitted with these standard features:
* The company provides iMac Pro in the baseline configuration costing $4,999, which gets you the following upgradeable features in terms of the CPU, GPU, RAM and storage:
* Aside from the baseline model, the following “recommended” configurations are available:
* And here are the optional upgrades available from Apple’s online store:
* Processor
* Memory
* Storage
* Graphics
* Magic Mouse or Trackpad
* Choosing any of the listed upgrades increases the prices of the baseline model beyond $4,999.
* If you max out everything and configure your iMac Pro with the fastest CPU, the most RAM and storage, double the video memory and the Magic Mouse 2 + Magic Trackpad 2 combo, you’ll have to pay a cool $13,348 for your beast of a machine.

* And if you add a VESA mount adapter kit (+$79) and some pre-installed software, such as Final Cut Pro X (+$300) and Logic Pro X (+$200), you’re looking at nearly $14,000 for the best, fastest Mac the money can buy (to be specific, we’re talking an eye-watering $13,926.98).
* Of course, iMac Pro is not really an all-in-one desktop computer for the rest of us.
* Aimed at professional photographers, app makers, video/music producers and VR developers, iMac Pro is the ultimate workstation for content producers rather than being a system for folks who just want to surf the web, check email, edit documents and manage photos.
* The soonest you can get your standard iMac Pro configuration is December 27, or just two days after Christmas. However, buying a maxed-out iMac Pro configuration yields a 6-8 weeks wait time, meaning your dream desktop won’t ship until sometime in February 2018.
* Bottom line: iMac Pro is the best, fastest and most expensive Mac Apple sells.
