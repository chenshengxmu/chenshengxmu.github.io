* Apple is reportedly looking to establish production headquarters in West Los Angeles to house its original content production effort, as reported Wednesday by The Real Deal (via 9to5Mac).
* The tech giant is reportedly in talks to lease the entirety of Hackman Capital Partners’ 85,000-square-foot creative office development at 5500 W. Jefferson Boulevard near Culver City.
* The space near the La Cienga Expo Line Station is around the corner from Apple’s Beats headquarters in Culver City. The office would be used for Apple’s original production effort.
* Hackman also developed the Beats headquarters. Plus, Apple was in talks to move its original content division to the iconic Culver Studios, which is also owned by Hackman.
* Apple has earmarked a yearly budget of $1 billion toward original video production, has hired top Sony Television veterans to lead the effort and is understood to have cut a deal to create new episodes of Spielberg’s 1980s sci-fi television anthology series “Amazing Stories.”
