* Microsoft is unveiling something today, but the company would uncharacteristically release no agenda for today’s presser, which begins at noon Pacific time. A media release only mentions that Microsoft will be making an announcement today and teases “news live from San Francisco via webcast“.
* It’s gotta be some kind of a biggie as Steve Ballmer, the CEO, “will share the news”, per the release. But what exactly is it? Office for iPad, anyone? It’s a simple YES/NO poll so cast your vote now…
* If they were buying Nokia, it would be on the investor site. If Redmond was unveiling Office 15, that would warrant a venue.
* We’ve known that Office for iPad has been in the works for some time now, though latest repots have indicated a late-2012 release date.
* Granted, it would be a tad peculiar if Microsoft released tablet Office for iPad first, then for its own Surface tablet.
* However, bear in mind that the two Office builds are probably being developed by separate teams and as such being scheduled for release independently of each other.
* Here, vote now.
* Will Microsoft launch Office for iPad today?
* Do you think the native Office suite for iPad, officially from Microsoft, is a big deal?
* Chime in with your thoughts down in the comments.
