* Comex gave some good news today on Twitter when he confirmed that he was not going to wait for iOS 4.1 to release an updated version to Spirit, the jailbreak tool that will work with iOS 4 and iOS 4.0.1.
* The right thing to do would be to save your SHSH blobs with Firmware Umbrella to insure you can always downgrade to a previous iOS in the future. It is the right thing to do, but it is certainly not mandatory.
* With PlanetBeing and MuscleNerd being almost done on their iPhone 4 unlock, it now makes sense to release Spirit.
* Excited?
