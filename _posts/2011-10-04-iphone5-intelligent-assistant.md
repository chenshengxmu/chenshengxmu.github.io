* We’ve been talking about this for quite some time, and today we finally found out what Apple is going to do with its purchase of voice-based artificial intelligence business, Siri. As we’d expected, Siri is now going to be built right into the iPhone 4S, bringing advanced voice control to Apple’s newly announced handset.
* During today’s special iPhone Event, Apple’s Scott Forstall showed off a variety of new and interesting ways of talking to your iPhone, with Siri doing the user’s bidding as if it was, scarily enough, a real assistant…
* Forstall’s dog and pony show took us through setting new alarms, asking for the weather forecast around the world, and even setting meetings using just the power of natural voice commands.
* Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia also get in on the action, offering users a great way to win pub quizzes the world over. Using hands-free technology, users can now ask the iPhone real questions, with the answer being returned via the relevant source.
* The iPhone 4S now also features good old dictation options, accessible via a microphone button on the iOS keyboard. Android users can stop snickering, now.
* All the new Siri features are listed as a beta by Apple, and will be available in English, French and German languages for now.
* This new feature is, unfortunately, an iPhone 4S feature only. Now we know what all that extra power is needed for!
