* It’s now official, the iPad 3G will be ship in the US by May 7th, according to Apple’s website. It’s interesting to note that even though Apple hadn’t been specific on a launch date back when they introduced the iPad, they did say it would launch 90 days after January 27. In short, they’re late, but not really…
* I know I’m not buying an iPad 3G. Why would I pay extra for 3G when I can simply tether my iPhone and share its 3G with my iPad? But at $130 more than the wifi-only version, I don’t think it’s a bad deal.

* What I really like about it too is the flexibility of the 3G data plan. You choose the amount of data per month you want to buy (250MB at $14.99, or unlimited data at $29.99).
* “Best of all, there’s no contract. So if you have a business trip or vacation approaching, just sign up for the month you’ll be traveling and cancel when you get back. You don’t need to visit a store to get 3G service. You can sign up, check your data usage, manage your account, or cancel your service — all from your iPad.”
* There’s still no official launch date in other countries. For more information, check out Apple’s website.
