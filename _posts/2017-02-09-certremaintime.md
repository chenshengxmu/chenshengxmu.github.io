* The Yalu jailbreak, just like the Pangu jailbreak before it, relies on certificates that have expiration dates. You have to re-sign the jailbreak with Cydia Impactor past the expiration date to keep your jailbroken state.
* No matter what kind of certificate you have, whether it’s a regular 7-day certificate or a 1-year developer certificate, it won’t last forever, and a new jailbreak app called CertRemainTime by lululombard can help you keep track of it.
* CertRemainTime is a simple app that gets added to your Home screen that’s always consciously aware of how long your Yalu jailbreak has before it needs to be re-signed.
* It’s a dead-simple app and there’s not much to it, as you’re about to see:

* It simply shows you when your certificate is set to expire, and as you can see, because I just re-signed my jailbreak on Tuesday, February 7th it will last until the very next Tuesday, February 14th.
* The app detects your jailbreak certificate information automatically and reports the date and time that it’s set to expire in the app, without any configuration at all.
* It’s a great companion app for the forgetful, and moreover, it’s always good to have a utility that helps to keep you mentally conscious of when it’s time to keep a computer nearby. After all, if you reboot your device when the certificate is expired, and you don’t have a computer nearby, you’ll end up jailbreak-less until you get back to your computer again.
* While the interface of the app itself is nothing to get excited over, I must say I really like that app icon. And moreover, I think it’s a good tool for any jailbroken device where the certificate expires.
* If you’re among those who have a steel trap for a mind and never forget when your jailbreak will expire, then I’ll have to hand you my congratulations and tell you that you’ll never need this app, but for those who don’t, you should check it out.
* It’s a free download in Cydia’s Bigboss repository and works on all devices jailbroken with the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10. Moreover, it’s open sourced on GitHub if you’re interested in learning more about the source code.
* Note: The app only works if you’ve jailbroken with Cydia Impactor. If you have jailbroken with any other way, such as via a web browser, the app is not guaranteed to work.
