* Taiwanese vendor Largan Precision, which supplies lenses for the dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus, recently confirmed it would start shipping facial recognition 3D sensors in the second half of this year, in time for iPhone 8.
* The company is currently in the process of expanding production capacities. They’ll be hiring a cool 4,500 workers for its new production facility, or nearly double its current workforce. Apple’s OLED-based iPhone 8 is said to use 3D sensors to capture a user’s face and iris, even in low-light conditions.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that a next-generation FaceTime camera on iPhone 8 would augment standard RGB sensors with infrared transmitting/receiving modules and include a bespoke 1.4-megapixel sensor capable of detecting changes in light signals.
* The next-generation camera would apparently use lasers invisible to the human eye for advanced features such as 3D selfies, accurate depth mapping, 3D modeling and more.
* iPhone 8’s image sensors should be built by Sony, like before.
* Largan CEO Adam Lin said in a press conference this week after the company’s annual general meeting, as reported by Nikkei, that they will have lenses for a 3D-sensing module “used in a smartphone ready to ship in the second half this year”.
* No phone vendor has officially announced a device with 3D lenses, leaving only iPhone 8 as the most likely phone with 3D lenses that’ll be ready to ship in the second half of 2017.
* Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting, estimates that Largan will supply 90 percent of rear-camera lenses for 2017 iPhones, around half of the 3D-sensing lenses and up to one-third of the front camera lenses. Foxconn-controlled Genius Electronics Optical and Japan’s Kantatsu are said to compete for the rest of the iPhone 8 orders.
