* After putting eleven smartwatches through various tests, Consumer Reports rated the Stainless Steel Apple Watch as the best of the category. Putting Apple, Samsung, Pebble, Sony, Martian, Asus, LG, and Motorola in direct competition, the folks at Consumer Reports took the eleven smartwatches through their labs to test for durability, health functionality, readability in bright and low light, ease of use, and ease of interaction.
* The Stainless Steel Apple Watch specifically shined in several tests, including step tracking, ease of use, scratch resistance, water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. The Sport version of Apple Watch did great too, but not quite as good when it came to scratch resistance.
* At the end of the tests, Stainless Steel Apple Watch was the top rated device. The rest of the ratings were behind a paywall, so if you’re interested in seeing how the Pebble faired, you will have to get a subscription to Consumer Reports.
