title: iOS 6- App Store video demonstration
---
* Apple left little untouched with its iOS 6 overhaul, and that includes the App Store app. The App Store has remained relatively the same over the years, but this version is a completely new and improved iteration.
* Itâ€™s so different, that you might not even recognize it on first glance. Thankfully, the changes are for the better, as this new App Store refresh provides a much more intuitive and seamless experience overall. One of the best new features is the ability to download items without being kicked back to the Home screen time and again. It really is that much better than before. Please feel free to share your thoughts on the iOS 6 version of the App Store app in the comments.
