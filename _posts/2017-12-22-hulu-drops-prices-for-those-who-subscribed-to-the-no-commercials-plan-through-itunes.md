* If you subscribed to Hulu’s “No Commercials” plan through your iOS device, or Apple TV, you should see a price reduction on your next bill, as the plan dropped by two dollars, from $13.99 to $11.99.
* To be fair here, Hulu did used to charge those who subscribed from within their app more than if you subscribed through their website. This was to make up for the 30% cut that Apple took from in-app subscriptions.
* Apple however recently changed their policy regarding in-app subscriptions, dropping their cut to only 15%. It seems that Hulu is now comfortable with pricing parity between platforms with Apple’s lower take.
* This is a great time for Hulu to make the announcement as well, as Netflix has just raised prices again.
* It is worth noting, that the App Store description has yet to be updated and still states $13.99, though the actual prompt in the app reflects the correct price of $11.99. The Limited Commercial plan still runs $7.99 in the app, which is the same as through Hulu’s website.
* Hulu can be downloaded for free from the App Store.
