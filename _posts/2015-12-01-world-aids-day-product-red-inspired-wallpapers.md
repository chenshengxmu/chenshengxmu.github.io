* Each year, Apple helps spread the word about the fight against AIDS. In so doing, they often announce or publicize apps or products that help generate revenue for the World AIDS Day organization. This year, Apple released the leather PRODUCT (RED) case for iPhone 6s and iPad.
* Inside, we have a wallpaper set that is similarly inspired by the PRODUCT(RED) initiative. Designer @Axinen quickly jumped at the chance to support AIDS awareness, by creating a set for iOS devices and desktop. You can find more images via Axinen’s homepage and step inside for the latest download.

* iDB posts new wallpapers every Sunday in the Wallpapers of the Week section. Often, we feature work by iDB readers or great images they find around the Internet. Just like Axinen, you too can submit wallpapers for consideration by catch me on Twitter via @jim_gresham. I am always on the prowl for the latest addition to our growing collection!
