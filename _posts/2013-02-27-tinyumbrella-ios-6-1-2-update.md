* In light of Apple releasing iOS 6.1.2 last week, notcom has seeded a new version of his TinyUmbrella app. The popular SHSH blob-saving tool now supports all versions of iOS, excluding 6.1.3, which is still in beta.
* That beta, though, is already causing waves in the jailbreak community. Evidence has been found in the firmware that Apple is patching evasi0n‘s exploits, which makes this TinyUmbrella extremely important…
* From the official TinyUmbrella blog:
* “TinyUmbrella has been updated to work with iOS 6.1.2 on relevant devices. Make sure you don’t update to 6.1.3 when it drops. I wasn’t able to get 6.1.3 beta included (I just got too busy). But if you desire to keep your jailbreak, avoid 6.1.3 like the plague.”
* The caution stems from a report from earlier this week, in which evad3rs team member planetbeing told Forbes that Apple has patched at least one of the five exploits that evasi0n uses, essentially killing the jailbreak.
* So for all of you who updated to iOS 6.1.2 last week to resolve the Exchange bug, you’ll want to make sure that you use this new version of TinyUmbrella to backup your blobs. If you need help, we have a great tutorial.
* If you don’t need help, you can grab the latest version of TinyUmbrella (and other jailbreak software) on our Downloads page. Just make sure you use it on all devices, and like notcom says, avoid iOS 6.1.3 when it drops.
