* After a bit of a shaky start, the Chronic Dev Team has finally released the much anticipated greenpois0n jailbreak, and it’s available for download now. Much like the already released limera1n, this jailbreak allows you to jailbreak iPhone running iOS 4.1 and iOS 4.2.1.
* The GreenPois0n download is now available for both Windows and Mac, and a Linux version might be in the works. GreenPois0n will allow you to jailbreak the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad, iPod Touch 3G, and iPod Touch 4G.
* You can download GreenPois0n from our downloads section.
* If you’re not sure how to use it, you may want to refer to our guide on how to jailbreak the iPhone using GreenPois0n.
