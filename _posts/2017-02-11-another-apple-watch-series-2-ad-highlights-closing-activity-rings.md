* Apple on Saturday released a new fitness-focused advertisement for Apple Watch Series 2 through its official YouTube channel. Titled “Catch, Swim, Play”, the commercial invites viewers to be more active and close their Activity rings. The latest 15-second video is a continuation of the previous mini-ad which also challenged viewers to close their Activity rings by moving more, having some exercise and standing up every 50 minutes for a bit.
* Here it is.
