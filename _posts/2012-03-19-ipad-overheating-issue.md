* The new iPad finally landed in consumer hands on Friday, March 16th and it looks like there are already people noticing an issue with Apple’s newest tablet.
* A growing number of users over at MacRumors forums and Apple support forums claim that the lower left-hand corner of their new iPad gets warm, or evern extremely hot in some cases…
* The new iPad has a larger battery and a faster and larger processing chip, so the device getting a bit warm isn’t out of the ordinary, since it is to be expected with any tablet or cellular device.
* As of yet, there is no definite reason to why some users are experiencing overheating issues with the new iPad. It could be the new LTE chipset or even the new larger battery Apple has implemented. Apple has yet to comment on the reports.
* I’ve been using my new iPad 16GB 4G version almost nonstop, and have not noticed it getting hot or even uncomfortably warm.
* Is your new iPad getting a little toasty?
