* Before Apple opened iPhone X preorders, we ran a little poll gauging purchase intentions and more than half the respondents said they’d opt for a Space Gray over a Silver model.
* Now that iPhone X has officially launched, we’d like to run a similar non-scientific poll to see which iPhone X model you have actually managed to get your hands on.
* It will definitely be interesting seeing whether the results of this poll are markedly different from the previous, but please don’t vote unless you have an iPhone X in your possession (that’s why the poll lacks an “I haven’t purchased an iPhone X yet” answer).
* Cast your vote now.
* Which iPhone X model did you buy?
* Mind telling us a bit more about the iPhone X you bought?
* Did they have the model you planned on preordering or did you have to settle with another color or storage capacity? What was your plan B anyway?
* Meet us in comments!
