* I find myself using my iPhone’s Clock app, with its included timer and stopwatch, for all sorts of arbitrary reasons.
* It’s a really handy thing to have, but it would even better if you didn’t have to launch the Clock app every time, just to access the time keeping functions.
* Enter TimerBar, a jailbreak tweak that allows you to invoke your timer from anywhere by means of Activator. Full video walkthrough, inside…
* Upon invoking the tweak, the TimerBar appears at the top of your iPhone, residing where the status bar normally does. It will remain there until you dismiss it, which makes it wonderful for avid multitaskers.
* Navigating to TimerBar’s settings panel reveals custom skins, Activator action methods, and the ability to alter your “time up” tones.
* If you’re someone who really likes to keep track of time, then TimerBar can be a great help; it’s landscape mode compatible, uses familiar Activator actions, and it’s relatively cheap at $0.99.
* If you’ve tried out TimerBar, let us know what you think in the comments below.
