* LA Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has been photographed today along with his wife Vanessa on Apple’s 1 Infinite Loop campus in Cupertino, California. The two were reportedly meeting Apple’s design guru Jony Ive to talk upcoming new products. An image a tipster sent in clearly shows Bryant and Vanessa waiting for food.
* Apple’s familiar corporate campus can be see in the background and image metadata confirms that the photo has indeed been taken with an iPhone on Apple’s campus…
* As reported by Seth Weintraub who runs 9to5 blogs, word on the street is that the alleged meeting between Bryant and Ive “centered around upcoming products”.
* The author did not explain how Bryant’s basketball talent could help Apple develop new products. It’s entirely possible that Apple is taking a page from Samsung’s marketing book and looking to cut an endorsement deal with celebrity athletes such as Bryant.
* And which Apple products could Bryant possibly endorse?
* A rumored iWatch is a viable possibility here.
* Bryant in March 2013 signed an endorsement deal with Hublot, a watch brand based in Switzerland and part of the LVMH luxury group.
* It’s interesting that Hublot recently accused Apple of poaching its talent. Bryant also has an endorsement deal with Lenovo and Nike, the latter being his biggest endorsement deal. Another connection: Apple CEO Tim Cook sits on Nike’s board of director.
* More food for thought: Nike recently announced plans to shutter its wearable-hardware efforts and is said to be partnering with Apple on a fitness band that would control other devices via gestures.
* In addition to Bryant, Apple is suspected of another puzzling celebrity deal that would see the firm buy Beats Electronics, LCC and install Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine as its executives.
* Draw your own conclusions…
* Maybe Kobe will go out on stage with Apple executives later this year to help promote iWatch?
