* Apple today updated the firmware on AirPods. The company did not publish the official changelog at post time so we don’t know what this new firmware update provides in terms of new features aside from bug fixes and performance improvements, but we’ll make sure to update the article as soon as we find out more. The new software bumps the AirPods firmware from the initial version 3.3.1 to version 3.5.1.
* To deploy the new firmware, put your AirPods inside their case and close it, connect the case to a charger or a USB port on your computer, then wait for a couple of minutes. Your iPhone must be paired with your AirPods and connected to Wi-Fi in order for the firmware to download and install.
