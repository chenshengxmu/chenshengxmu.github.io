* Following months of rumors, and a few teasers from the company itself, Logitech has finally unveiled its first iOS 7 game controller. It’s called the ‘PowerShell,’ and it works with any iPhone 5, iPhone 5s or 5th generation iPod touch.
* The game pad features console-style controls, with a d-pad, an X-Y-B-A button cluster, and two shoulder triggers. It also features an integrated 1500mAh battery, which will keep your iOS device running long after it runs out of juice…

* From Logitech’s announcement:
* “If you’re one of the millions of people who play mobile games on your iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, or iPod touch (5th generation) running iOS 7, you’re going to be interested in our latest Logitech G product – the Logitech® PowerShell™ Controller + Battery.  The PowerShell Controller + Battery turns your compatible iOS7 device into a pocket sized mobile console, all while roughly doubling your play time with its on board battery. 
* “To use this first-of-its-kind mobile gaming console, simply insert your compatible iPhone or iPod touch into the controller as you would with a standard case. The analog off-screen controls of the Logitech PowerShell Controller + Battery deliver a gaming experience that’s familiar to console players everywhere, with a D-pad, shoulder triggers and face buttons that allow you to control game play.”
* And here’s a promo clip for the PowerShell:
* Because the accessory is part of Apple’s MFi program, it’s compatible with several iOS games. And that number will continue to grow—in fact Logitech is keeping a running list. Current big-name titles include Oceanhorn and Asphalt 8.
* Today’s launch comes just a day after Moga unveiled its ‘Ace Power’ iOS 7 controller. It too features a built-in battery pack, and retails for the same price of $99. If you’re interested in the PowerShell, you can find it on Logitech’s website.
