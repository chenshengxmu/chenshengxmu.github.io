* The wallet case is a popular choice for iPhone owners, as it combines two things that you’d normally have to carry separately—your phone and wallet—into one easy-to-cary item. Thus, we thought it would be helpful if we put together a list of some great wallet cases for the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.
* As usual, we based our selections on factors like personal experience, price, and customer feedback. We also paid attention to design—we wanted a mix of slot and folio cases—and availability. Because the iPhone 7 was just released, a lot of case-makers don’t have wallet options available yet.

* Silk’s Vault Slim Wallet case line has been a favorite among iPhone users for years, and this one for the iPhone 7 is currently an Amazon Best Seller. It features a durable one-piece design with high-grip textured sides and comes with a premium scratch-resistant screen protector. The wallet portion of the case can comfortably fit 3 credit or ID cards plus some cash, and it comes in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Silk Vault Slim Wallet case for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $14.99.

* The Silk is nice but if you’re looking for a more premium case from a recognizable brand, check out the Speck Presidio Wallet Case. It too features a side-loading slot that securely holds 3 cards and case, as well as a durable 10-foot drop-tested design that is 20% thinner than Speck’s previous cases.  Note that shipping estimates are longer on this case than the others, but for some folks the wait may be worth it.
* You can buy this Speck Presidio Wallet case for iPhone 7 for $44.95.

* Now if the Speck is a little too expensive but you still want a name-brand wallet case, I’d recommend the Incipio Stowaway. The versatile case is the perfect solution for protecting your device and storing up to three credit cards or ID’s. It also comes with a built-in kickstand, and is available in multiple colors.
* You can buy the Incipio Stowaway Wallet case for iPhone 7 for $29.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $34.99.

* To be honest I don’t know much about Shieldon, but if you’re looking for a genuine leather wallet case for your iPhone 7 on the cheap, this looks like a solid option. It has a full 5-star rating on Amazon on over 60 reviews, and their other case offerings have similar feedback. Their Wallet case has 3 credit card/ID slots and there is an extra side pocket for cash. Doubles as a stand and features a magnetic closure.
* You can buy this Shieldon leather Wallet case for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $25.99.

* The OtterBox name is synonymous with quality and durability, and it’s no different with their Strada Series. It’s a genuine leather folio-style case with a vertical cardholder and a dual-layer design that protects against drops and scratches. You’re going to get the 1-year case warranty from OtterBox here, and their great customer support. Note that like the Speck, shipping estimates for the Strada are much further out than other cases.
* You can buy the OtterBox Strada wallet case for iPhone 7 for $49.95 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $59.95.
