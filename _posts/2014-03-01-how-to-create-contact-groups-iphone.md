* A few days ago, we published a post explaining how to create contact groups on Mac, so we thought it would be a good idea to show you how to do that directly from your iPhone or iPad as well. Creating contact groups on iPhone is a fairly simple process, however, it does require to install a third-party application as the stock Contacts app for iOS doesn’t let you create and edit groups on the fly.
* No one will argue that not being able to manage contact groups directly from your iPhone is a terrible limitation of iOS, but we’re not really here to discuss what could and should be.
* In this post, we will show you how to manage contact groups on iPhone or iPad by using an application called Address Book Plus. Not only we will explain how to create contact groups, but we will also show you how to manage and edit these groups…
* There are many applications in the App Store that let you create groups of contacts on iPhone and iPad. From my experience, Address Book Plus is one of the best out there as it is inexpensive, simple, and offers a simple design, although the app could benefit from an update. However I understand you might want to explore your options, which is why I listed several alternatives at the bottom of this post.
* Note that this method works whether you use an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* Step 1: Launch Address Book Plus and grant it access to your contacts (only required the first time you launch the application).
* Step 2: Tap the + icon at the upper right, which should take you to the Add Group screen.

* Step 3: Type in a group name. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will call this group “Friends,” but you’re obviously free to name it whatever you want. Tap Done once you have typed in the name of your new group.

* Step 4: You will then be taken back to the main screen of the application. From there, you should see your newly created group, as well as other groups that you might have created before on macOS for example.

* Now that we have created a new group, we’re going to add contacts to this group.
* Step 1: On the main screen of the Address Book Plus app, tap All Contacts. This will take you to a list of all the contacts that are on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Scroll until you find a contact you want to add to one of your groups. Once you have found him, tap the ” i ” icon located on the right hand side of the contact name. This will take you to a screen where you can assign this contact to a group.

* Step 3: Select what group you want to add this contact to. Note that you can add one contact to multiple groups. Once you have assigned your contact to one or several groups, tap the All Contacts button in the upper left of the screen to go back to your list of contacts.
* Step 4: Repeat step 3 until you have added all the contacts you want to one or several groups.
* Note that removing a contact from a group does not delete this contact from your address book.
* Step 1: Go back to the main screen of the Address Book Plus app. Tap on a group from which you want to remove one or several contacts. This will show you all the contacts that have been assigned to this group.

* Step 2: Select what contact you want to remove from this group and tap on the ” i ” icon on the right hand side of the contact name. You will then see what groups this contact has been assigned to.
* Step 3: Simply tap on a group to uncheck the contact‘s assignment to this group. At this time, you can easily reassign this contact to other groups, or to no group at all.

* Step 4: Repeat the process for each contact you wish to remove from a group.
* As mentioned above, there are many apps in the App Store that let you create contact groups on iPad or iPhone. This is a selection of some of these apps, in no specific order of preference.
