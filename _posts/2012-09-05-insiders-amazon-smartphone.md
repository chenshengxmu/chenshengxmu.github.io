* We’re nearing the end of the two-week run of product announcements leading up to Apple’s iPhone event. Last week, Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note 2. And today, both Nokia and Motorola showed off new hardware.
* Tomorrow, Amazon will play the final opening act with a media event in Los Angeles, where it’s expected to unveil a handful of new Kindle tablets. But according to a new report, it may have a few surprises up its sleeves…
* The Verge is reporting that it has learned that the retail giant may show off its long-rumored smartphone tomorrow. The handset, which has been whispered about for months, is said to be running a forked version of Android.
* “Multiple sources have confirmed to The Verge that Amazon is working on a smartphone that runs a variant of the Kindle Fire’s Android-based operating system, and we’re now hearing that the device will be shown to the press tomorrow.
* The phone itself is said to be currently unfinished, so if Amazon does announce it we wouldn’t expect too many details.”
* Of course, Amazon’s services — App Store, Music, Instant Video — will come preinstalled on the handset. And it is said to be using Nokia’s mapping software, since, with custom versions of Android, Google Maps isn’t an option.
* It wouldn’t surprise us if an Amazon-branded smartphone made an appearance at tomorrow’s presser. Back in July of this year, both the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg confirmed that the retailer was testing handsets.
* We’ll be watching Amazon’s event tomorrow and will report back with anything of interest. At the very least, the company is expected to announce an update to its popular Kindle Fire and a few other new tablets.
* Either way, tomorrow just got a little bit more interesting.
* What are your thoughts on an Amazon smartphone?
