* Apple’s fixed a bug in its Clips app for making expressive, easily shareable videos on the go.
* Since hitting App Store on November 9, the Clips 2.0 update has brought out a ridiculous number of exciting new features and templates, including 360-degree Selfie Scenes that take advantage of the TrueDepth camera in iPhone X.
* Some people, however, complained that Selfie Scenes would not rotate properly on their iPhone X if Location Services are disabled in Settings. This has now been fixed in Clips 2.0.1.
* Download Clips for free from App Store.
