* Those who haven’t picked up Apple’s latest handset yet might be interested in this deal. 9to5Mac is reporting that some Target locations are taking $25 dollars off of multiple iPhone 4S models through the end of the month.
* The site received a photo from a tipster showing the discount on an in-store advertisement at a store in Orlando, FL. And according to the ad, the deal applies to both 16GB and 32GB models, as well as all three carrier versions…
* The iPhone 4S, which Apple launched last October, has been an overwhelming success thus far. Features like its 8MP camera and Siri assistant helped power Apple’s handset sales to a record-breaking 37 million units last quarter.
* But if you aren’t interested in owning the latest and greatest, it appears that Target is also knocking $25 off of the iPhone 4 as well. That means you can pick one up for as low as $74.99. Not bad.
* We weren’t able to confirm if this campaign was nationwide or not, but our local store is participating. Either way, if you’re looking to get a good deal on one of the most popular smartphones on the market, it’s worth checking out.
