* macOS Sierra was just released with a flurry of new features, one of them being the ability to watch videos in a new mode called Picture-in-Picture. When enabled, this allows you to detach a video from its player, and place it anywhere in a resizable window on your screen. This is particularly handy if you want to watch a video while working, for instance.
* While the majority of video players you will encounter will already support Picture-in-Picture, there are a few rebels out there that still don’t, and YouTube is one of them. Fortunately, there is a simple workaround for this.
* As we previously noted when Apple first unveiled this new feature, a simple trick can allow you to put YouTube videos in Picture-in-Picture mode, letting you separate said video from its player and pin it anywhere on your Mac’s screen.
* To do so, all you have to do is to right click on the video twice (or press Control + click twice) and you will then see a new menu appear, with the option to enter Picture-in-Picture mode. When selecting that option, your video will then be detached from the player and you will be able to pin it anywhere you want on the screen.
* Proper support for Picture-in-Picture for YouTube and other players will likely come in the near future, but in the meantime, this is your best option to enjoy this feature.
