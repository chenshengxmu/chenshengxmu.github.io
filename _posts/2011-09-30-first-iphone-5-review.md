* After scoring the lost iPhone 4 prototype last year, it was hard for Gizmodo to outdo themselves this year. Yet they still did, by publishing the world’s first iPhone 5 review four days before the device is actually unveiled by Apple.
* How could they possibly do this? The answer is rather simple: by creating a physical mockup based on the rumors we’ve heard, but also by focusing their review mainly on iOS 5. The result isn’t as bad as you’d think…
* “What’s the point of waiting for the same few people to write the same single glowing review of Apple’s new phone? There is none. So we didn’t.
* We had our intern make a mock-up of the new phone using specs from the leaked cases; we found other devices that made use of some of the iPhone’s components; and we carried the foam core iDevice for a couple weeks, loaded up our actual phones with iOS5 and iCloud and got down to business.
* This is the first review of the iPhone 5. Sure, it’s a little, uhm, hacked-together, but I’ll bet you it’s not going to differ significantly from the officially sanctioned reviews that come out next week.”

* We at iDB will just wait for the real thing next week.
