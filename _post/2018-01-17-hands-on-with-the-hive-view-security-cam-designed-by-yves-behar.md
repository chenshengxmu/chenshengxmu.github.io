* The UK smart home company Hive recently announced their latest product, a stylish home security camera known as the Hive View. We got to go hands-on with a wall of them over at CES and here are our initial impressions.
* I was super impressed with the build quality and design of the Hive View when I spent some time with it. It really does look beautiful, and shuns the normative idea that cameras need to be hidden.

* The only downside I found with the camera is that the battery life was a bit lacking. It will only last you an hour or so, which is great for the short term, but it would have been nice if it was capable of running overnight.
* There’s many home security camera options out there on the market, but if you would like to pick up the Hive View, you can do so from their website for $199.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
