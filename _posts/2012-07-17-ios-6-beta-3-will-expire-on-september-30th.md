* Here is a gentle warning for those of you who have downloaded iOS beta 3, which was released yesterday. According to iOS hacker iH8sn0w, this latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system is set to expire on September 30th, 2012.
* But what will happen after this date?
* If you have not updated to iOS 6 beta 4 or maybe the official release of iOS 6 by then, your iDevice will be temporarily bricked, at least until you update to either the official iOS 6, or a later beta version, whatever will be available at the time.
* Bottom line is, make sure to update to iOS 6 beta 4 when/if available, or to the official iOS 6 public release when it’s available if you don’t want to risk being locked out of your device.
* It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but you’d have to download the full beta software to your computer and go through the restore process, which is much less convenient than a simple OTA update.
