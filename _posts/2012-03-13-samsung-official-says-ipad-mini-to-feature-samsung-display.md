* The iPad Mini has been in the rumor mill for quite a while, and we’ve heard some pretty interesting things about the 7-inch tablet. Yesterday, a report was published saying the smaller version of the iPad will feature a slim bezel display that may allow for a larger viewing area.
* Today we got word that Samsung is the exclusive supplier of the Retina display for the third-generation iPad. We’re also hearing out of the Korea Times, that a Samsung official told the publication that Apple will release a 7.85-inch iPad by the end of the year, using Samsung’s displays…
* Samsung is the exclusive manufacturer of Apple’s A5 chip and is also expected to be the manufacturer of the A5X chip, but we’ll have to wait for confirmation from teardowns. At any rate, Apple and Samsung are working close together, besides the on going legal battles. It makes sense for Samsung to supply parts for the iPad Mini.
* Earlier this month, a leaked document out of a Samsung analyst also said that Apple may launch an iPad Mini in the third quarter of this year.
* A third quarter release would put the smaller tablet in direct competition with Amazon’s Kindle Fire, which has seen success among new tablet owners. Perhaps Apple’s smaller tablet offering would help bring over some sales.
* Apple just announced its third-generation iPad last week, and it’s set to go on sale this Friday. The 10-inch tablet packs a Retina display, however, the iPad Mini has been rumored not to feature the 2048×1536 pixel madness.
* Do you think Apple will release a smaller iPad by the end of the year?
