* Apple on Tuesday released a fourth beta of what would become the first major software update to macOS Sierra following its public release last month. macOS 10.12.1 beta 4 (build 16B2548a) is now available to members of Apple Develop Program and public beta testers on Apple Beta Software Program.
* The latest build is available as an over-the-air update via the Mac App Store and the Software Update mechanism on Macs that run a prior beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1.
* macOS 10.12.1 beta 4 arrived eight days following macOS 10.12.1 beta 3, which released for beta testing on October 3. It focuses on bug fixes and performance improvements and does not include any new outward-facing user features.
* When it releases for public consumption, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 will bring support for Portrait albums in the Photos app. The new built-in album was created to hold photos taken using the iPhone 7 Plus’s depth of field photography mode.
* If you have a developer account with Apple, you can also grab macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 4 from Apple Developer Center.
