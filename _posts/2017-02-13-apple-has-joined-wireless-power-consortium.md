* Apple has officially joined the Wireless Power Consortium, a multinational technology consortium which creates and promotes market adoption of its ubiquitous interface standard Qi (pronounced chee) that’s being used for wireless charging across a number of consumer electronics devices.
* The move could be interpreted as another sign that Apple’s rumored iPhone 8 might come with wireless charging capabilities, as rumored.
* The Cupertino company is now listed as a member of the organization.
* There are currently 213 members of the Wireless Power Consortium. Last year, 152 different brands registered a Qi-compliant product on the official Wireless Power Consortium website, up from 86 in 2015.
* The Qi protocol is currently used by more than 200 companies and is in 1343 products you can buy now. Apple Watch uses a bespoke version of the Q1 wireless charging standard that’s however incompatible with existing Qi chargers.

* Qi includes the benefits of both inductive and resonant charging technologies.
* With inductive charging technology, the charge passes between a transmitter and receiver coil placed closely together. The coils must be aligned to make the connection though some Qi transmitters use a multi-coil system, eliminating the need to align the device on the charging area.
* Qi resonant wireless charging removes the close-contact requirement, meaning the transmitter can detect and charge existing Qi receivers at up to 45mm, allowing users to mount a charger under a table, desk or embed the technology deeper into a device.
* Japanese blog Mac Otakara said yesterday that wireless charging could be an optional feature of Apple’s next iPhone as the device reportedly won’t ship with a wireless charger in the box, requiring the purchase of an optional wireless charging accessory.
* The need for a dedicated wireless charging pad could be interpreted as a sign that iPhone 8 will probably leverage inductive charging like Apple Watch. Prior rumors asserted that the Cupertino company was working on a long-range RF charging solution that wouldn’t require a charging pad.
* A recent survey by IHS Technology has shown that more than 90 percent of respondent would consider wireless charging as one of the key factors in determining their next device purchase.
* Thanks, Carlos!
