title: White iPhone 4 Once Again Pulled From Apple's Inventory
---
* White iPhone 4 rumors are a dime a dozen these days. But because of the device’s mysterious non-existence, we all still seem to pay attention. At any rate, if you tried to visit the online Apple Store late last night, chances are you saw the above message.

* It’s been back up and operating for a while now, but why did Apple take their store offline? Typically this is just a sign of site maintenance, and sometimes it can mean that Apple is preparing to launch a new product. A Mac news website is claiming that this time, Apple took the store offline to remove white iPhone 4 SKUs…
* 9to5Mac reported last night that one of their Apple Retail contacts went into Apple’s inventory system to investigate, after noticing the Apple Store was down. The only change he could find though, was the removal of the white iPhone 4 SKU. This falls in line with reports earlier in the week, that Apple was removing the white version of the iPhone 4 from websites across the globe.
* We were expecting to see a white iPhone as early as this month. We’ve seen white iPhone icons in iTunes resource files and it was even confirmed by Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak. I’ll believe it when I see it. When it first launched, I actually held out on purchasing an iPhone 4 for weeks in hopes that a white version would quickly turn up.
* Thank goodness I finally caved in. Because almost a year after the original 4th generation iPhone hit the streets, the white iPhone 4 has yet to see the light of day.Will we ever see this fabled smartphone?
* I don’t know what to think at this point. It would be interesting to have a roundtable discussion with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook in about 10 years. Amongst many other questions I’d ask them, “On a scale of 1-10, how mad was Steve Jobs over the white iPhone 4 fiasco?”
* What do you think, will we ever see a white iPhone 4?
