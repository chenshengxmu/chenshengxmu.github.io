* pod2g has been a busy man these days, and he has again updated his blog with some interesting information regarding the upcoming Hack In The Box security conference in Amsterdam.
* The conference is slated to happen between May 21 through May 25 and will feature a variety of speakers and backing by high profile sponsors like Microsoft and RIM.
* The real interesting part about all of this is that apparently there will be some big news related to jailbreaking unveiled at this yearâ€™s conference. Could it have anything to do with the upcoming 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak?
* Judging from pod2gâ€™s post, it sure seems feasible:
* Itâ€™s like something bigâ€™s going to happen at HITB related to jailbreaking : look at this.
* No more to say ðŸ˜‰
* Interestingly enough, the link he provides is a tweet from non other than the official Chronic Dev Team Twitter account, who incidentally will be the oneâ€™s who create the tool that incorporates pod2gâ€™s work:
* Ready for some jailbreak goodness? We are ðŸ™‚ #HITB2012AMS registrations close soon conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf201â€¦

* Now itâ€™s totally possible that this could end up being nothing, but it sure seems like something big related to jailbreaking might be unveiled. And whatâ€™s bigger than the iOS 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak at the moment?
* pod2g says that we should expect the iOS 5.1.1 untether to be available in a two weeks. The conference falls a little bit short of that two week time frame, but judging from what weâ€™ve seen already it seems entirely possible that it could be ready on or before May 25th, which happens to be the last day of the conference.
* What are your thoughts? Do you think the jailbreak will be released during the upcoming Hack In The Box conference?
