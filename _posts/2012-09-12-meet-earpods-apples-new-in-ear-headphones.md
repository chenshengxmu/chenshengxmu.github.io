* It is no secret that Apple’s in-ear headphones that ship with iPhones and iPods leave a lot to be desired. Sound quality is average, at best, bass is non-existent and highs sound a little too robotic. Of course, we knew Apple would be introducing a brand new headset today. What we haven’t known is that the company spent three years designing the new headphones, dubbed EarPods. Yes, three years…
* iTunes head Greg Joswiak noted:
* Doing a great headphone is hard. Ears are challenging. Everyone’s are different, but you have to make one size.
* He’s right about the one-size-fits-all requirement: the current headset is driving me crazy as it falls out of my ear constantly.
* So, what does designing earphones that fit for everyone compares to, Greg?
* It would be like making shoes that are the same size that fit everyone’s feet. But that’s what we’ve tried to do.
* This is what the EarPods look like.

* The company played a promotional video at the presser, signifying that it deems the new headset a substantial improvement.
* Hopefully, they fit and sound better than the crappy headset it replaces.
* The new headset is available today.
* Apple is providing these as a standalone accessory, including them with every iPod touch, iPod nano and iPhone 5.
* “I think music lovers will love these”, we shall see about that once we have a chance to test what the headset feels and sounds like.
* What do you think, are those headphones worth the price?
