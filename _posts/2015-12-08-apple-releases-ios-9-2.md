* Apple has officially released the public edition of iOS 9.2 for supported iPhones, iPads, and the iPod touch. The update brings several new bug fixes, Apple Music enhancements, and other improvements to all compatible iOS devices. iOS 9.2 is available as an OTA update, and should be shortly available when connecting to iTunes as well.

* Apple Music improvements
* Additional enhancements
* Accessibility improvements
* iOS 9.2 build 13C75 download links:
* As you can see, there are lots of new fixes for Apple Music, Accessibility, and other areas of iOS 9. The biggest change, for me at least, is the ability to create a new playlist on the fly when trying to add music to a playlist. That was such an obvious flaw in the previous version of Apple Music, and I’m glad to see that it has been fixed.
* As we learned from the previous iOS 9.2 beta, there are some significant updates for Safari View Controller, such as the ability to use Safari View Controller web pages with more extensions, and the ability to reload the page without content blockers and request the desktop version of a site.
