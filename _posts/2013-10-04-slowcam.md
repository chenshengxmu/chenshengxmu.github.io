title: SlowCam brings slow motion video recording to every iOS device
---
* When Apple announced that the iPhone 5s came with slow motion video capture, I was immediately envious of everyone that would be upgrading this year. Slow motion video is almost as awesome as high-speed video.

* SlowCam – Realtime Slow motion Video Camera is a video app that turns my green envy into gold. With it, you don’t need a brand new iPhone in order to create slow motion videos. All you need is iOS 7…
* The app is very easy to use. As soon as you open it, the viewfinder appears. Start recording by tapping the red record button. The app records video at the highest framerate capable on your device. If you have the new iPhone 5s, you can record at 120 FPS. The iPhone 5 and 5c, plus the iPad mini are capable of 60 FPS. All other devices can record at 30 FPS.
* While recording, hold the blue snail that is just above the record button to slow things down. Hold the button until you want to go back to normal speed recording. If you want to change the app’s settings so that you can tap the snail instead of holding it, select SlowCam in your Settings app and toggle “Single Tap to Start SloMo” on.

* You can zoom in 5X on the iPhone 5, 5c and 5s. Touch and hold the plus/minus bar on the side of the screen to change the zoom. There is a “torch” feature that turns on your camera’s flash while you record so you can get better video in dark lighting.
* You can also set the camera’s focus and exposure separately or together. Tap the screen to bring up the two targets. Then, drag the focus to the subject you want clear and drag the exposure to the area you want the lighting to capture.

* You can record slow motion multiple times in the same video. All you have to do is touch and hold the snail whenever you want to slow down the action. If you are recording a race, use SlowCam every time the cars pass in front of you for a cool video trick.
* When you are done recording, your video will be rendered and immediately sent to your iOS device’s camera roll where you can share it through SMS, email, YouTube, FaceBook, Vimeo, or iCloud.
* This app is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for $1.99. Download it in the App Store today.
