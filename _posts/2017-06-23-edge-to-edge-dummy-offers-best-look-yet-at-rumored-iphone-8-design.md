* iPhone 8 is expected to have a nearly full-screen front face with a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED panel and no “chin” at the handset’s top and bottom. Benjamin Geskin has now combined the leaked parts in a dummy unit showing off what iPhone 8 might look like at launch.
* The prolific smartphone leakster put a printed image of iOS 10.3.3’s beach-themed wallpaper under a glossy screen protector to simulate edge-to-edge display design. He also posted a video on his Twitter account to show off the assembled dummy in motion.
* I think this is our best glimpse yet at what iPhone 8 might look like.

* My only gripe with this Frankenstein iPhone dummy is the top area with a cutout for the front-facing FaceTime camera, the speaker and the phone’s various sensors—it just doesn’t look right to me. Now, Apple is said to have tested ten different iPhone 8 prototypes.
* That said, there’s still a chance we might see a fully bezel-less iPhone 8 come this fall rather than this nearly bezel-less appearance. But even if it does end up having that cutout at the top of the OLED display, the sensor dip may not be visible at all.
* That’s because OLED technology provides deep blacks, thereby making it difficult to tell where the edge of the screen really is, as readily apparent by the OLED screen on Apple Watch.

* As the rendering above indicates, Apple could update iOS’s status bar at the top so that the icons appear on the left and right side, without the current time being shown in the middle.
* That would actually be a smart approach to concealing that sensor dip as much as possible.
* Thoughts?
