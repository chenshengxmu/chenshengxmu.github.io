* You know you’re doing something right when your competition spends more time in its commercials bad-mouthing you and your products than it does actually advertising its own. So Apple must be doing something extremely right.
* We’ve seen it with Samsung, we’ve seen it with Microsoft, and now Nokia is getting in on the action. The Finnish handset maker released a new ad this morning that portrays iPhone users as mindless zombies. Full clip after the fold…

* I get the concept here. The ad is really about how the Nokia Lumia 925 can take great low-light photos, even without a flash, while at the same time making a tongue-in-cheek reference to iPhone users. And hey, zombies are super in right now.
* But honestly, I think the ad is awful. It’s poorly produced, and comes off as a bit desperate. And the worst part is, you rarely see the Lumia 925 handset or its ability to take high quality low-light photos—which was the whole point of the ad.
* Here’s a few reactions from Twitter:
* Nokia’s new Lumia 925 ad is horrible. Showed it to my girlfriend. Her exact words: “No wonder they’re broke.” https://t.co/W5rDQwOYE7 | $NOK

* The new Nokia Lumia ad makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. What exactly are the selling? https://t.co/rvZVYcribe

* And these kind of responses seem pretty par for the course in my Twitter stream, though admittedly I have seen a few people say they liked the spot. But you have to wonder what the general public will think once this ad airs on television.
* Will they get it? Will this commercial make them want to drop what they’re doing and go grab a Lumia 925?
* What did you think of the ad?
