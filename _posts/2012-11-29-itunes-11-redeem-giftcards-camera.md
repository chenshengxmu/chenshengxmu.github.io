* As we’re sorting through all of the major changes in iTunes 11, the Interwebs is starting to light up with reports of the little things and nice-to-haves that Apple did not include in the full changelog for iTunes 11. One of such features that I know will be hugely popular with parents and people who buy iTunes Gift Cards is the ability to redeem any such card with your Mac’s camera, without typing in a single character, just like that. It’s just one of those little things that make life more easier and enjoyable. Here’s how it works…
* Kudos to Buster Heine of Cult of Mac for spotting this feature.
* “Users can simply hold their giftcard up to the FaceTime camera on their Mac and iTunes will read the code and redeem the value for it”, he writes.
* Simply fire up iTunes 11, go to the iTunes Store and click the “Redeem” link on the right side. The familiar-looking Redeem page will pop up, offerin a new option to use the Mac’s FaceTime camera to redeem the giftcard.
* It’s an awesome feature, but Apple could have taken it a little further. For example, why not let me use the camera on my iOS device, in case I have an older Mac without a built-in camera (or perhaps it’s broken or whatever).
* At any rate, I’m absolutely loving this feature. Stuff like this stands as a testament to why we love Apple and appreciate its engineers sweating over the little things.
* Thoughts?
