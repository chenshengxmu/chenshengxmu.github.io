* Windows users rejoice! GreenPois0n has been released for Windows machines after seeing a few days of exclusivity for the Mac.
* It was earlier today when we reported that the Windows version would make it to jailbreakers this weekend, and now the Chronic Dev Team has made good on its promises.
* Check inside for the details and the download…
* As with the Mac version, the Windows version of GreenPois0n can be downloaded from our downloads section.
* If you need help using this jailbreak tool, feel free to use our tutorial, and our guide on installing Cydia if you run into issues with Loader.
* Now that Mac and Windows users have an untethered jailbreak solution for iOS 4.2.1, who’s next? Oh, that’s right, Linux.
* If the Chronic Dev Team’s track record is any indication, Linux users shouldn’t have to wait that long at all. In fact there’s already a placeholder for Linux on their GreenPois0n website.
* Again this should work with the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.1.
* How do you feel now that the Windows version is finally here?
