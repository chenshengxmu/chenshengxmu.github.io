* Folks who chose to skip all of the Black Friday mayhem this weekend will be happy to hear that a new wave of deals on apps, consumer electronics and other products are on the way. And there’s no crowd-fighting or line-waiting required.
* Tomorrow is known as Cyber Monday, a marketing term created for the Monday after Thanksgiving to promote online shopping. And once again, a number of retailers and manufacturers will be offering major discounts on their products.
* And again, iDB has you covered, as we’ve collected all the best offers and put them in one, easy-to-read list. Presenting our Cyber Monday Deals Roundup…
* You’ll notice that a lot of these deals aren’t as significant as they were on Black Friday, but there is still hundreds of dollars in savings below. Also keep in mind that some of these deals are good both online and in-store, and others just online.
* This is a running list, and we plan to add more items to it over the next several hours as more deals get announced. So make sure you continue to check back with us periodically throughout the rest of today and tomorrow. Happy hunting!
