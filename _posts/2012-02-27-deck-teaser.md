* Deck is an upcoming jailbreak tweak from SBCoders that is currently in beta testing. It promises to lend added functionality to your SpringBoard by adding an App switcher-esque side bar that’s accessible by swiping.
* Inside the “hotbar” you’ll gain access to a multitude of customizable functions, and shortcuts. It looks like a great compliment to the currently existing App switcher.
* SBCoders has released a teaser video that shows Deck in action, check inside to have a look…
* If you ask me, I’d say it looks quite nice, and I’m looking forward to giving it a hands-on walkthrough.
* Deck will require iOS 5, and we’ve heard that it will cost between $0.99 and $1.99. Let us know what you think in the comments about Deck.
* Update: We’ve added our very own Deck hands-on video here.
