* I definitely plan on buying the new Apple TV.
* As a huge fan of the fourth-generation model, this new box with its A10X Fusion chip and 4K resolution should be a powerful entertainment device for my living room.
* I’ll be definitely getting a cellular Apple Watch Series 3, too.
* Of course, and a 256GB iPhone X, too, because my wireless contract has just ended and I’m eligible for an upgrade. I plan on signing a new two-year plan with my carrier—that should at least make the upfront cost of the top-of-the-line iPhone X somewhat more bearable.
* So, what’s your buying strategy when it comes to Apple’s new gadgets?
