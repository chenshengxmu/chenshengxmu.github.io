* Unofficial Lightning accessories that use cracked chips one-up Apple’s offering on price, but the “Made for iPhone” (MFi) stamp of approval has its advantages, mostly by reassuring buyers that MFi accessories meet Apple’s standards of quality and extensive testing. Belkin was the first third-party manufacturer out of the gate with 30-pin connector accessories back in 2003.
* On Monday, it has also become the first official Apple partner to launch Lightning-enabled accessories. The company launched a car charger and a sync dock, both priced within reach of budget shoppers. Belkin is accepting pre-orders today, promising to ship the products later this month…
* In a media release, the company announced that the accessories will ship mid-November, the first official third-party Lightning accessories. The company also said it plans on releasing several new Lightning accessories “this year”.
* The $30 Car Charger for Lightning, basically an updated version of Belkin’s  slim-profile car charger, provides ten watts of power to charge your iOS devices and offers over-voltage protection to protect your shiny new toys. It comes with the included hardwired Lightning cable and is available in black only.

* The Charge + Sync Dock, also a $30 value and is case-compatible. It has a removable magnetic base, provides audio out to EarPods or other headphones or speakers and features a nice foldaway AUX jack and has the magnetic base which removes to reveal a cable channel that holds your connector securely in place for easy cable feeding. This accessory doesn’t include the Lightning connector cable and is meant to be used with Apple-branded Lightning connector cable only.
