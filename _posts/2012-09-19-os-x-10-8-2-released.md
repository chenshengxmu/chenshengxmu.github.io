* A few days ago, I highlighted my experience with OS X 10.8.2, which is like the perfect supplement for Mac users who’ve just upgraded their mobile devices to iOS 6.
* Some of the biggest features included is phone number support for iMessage, which makes the entire iMessage experience lightyears better than before, and Facebook single sign on integration.
