* Good news, fellow jailbreakers. Saurik has just pushed an update to Cydia Substrate to lend it iOS 8 compatibility. This means that tweaks that rely on Cydia Substrate to run (most of them should) can now be updated to work with iOS 8 as well.
* Cydia Substrate has always been a big part of the puzzle that needed to be there for this iOS 8 jailbreak to really gain steam as far as jailbreak apps and tweaks are concerned. If you’re already jailbroken and have Cydia installed, then Cydia Substrate 0.9.5013 should appear as an update in Cydia.
* If you’ve yet to jailbreak, be sure to follow our two jailbreak tutorials. The first tutorial shows you how to jailbreak iOS 8.1 with Pangu 1.0.1:
* The second tutorial shows you how to install Cydia on iOS 8.1, since Cydia is not yet prepackaged with the Pangu jailbreak:
* Once you do those things, launch Cydia, and you can search for Cydia Substrate and install it. Of course, a lot of cleanup still needs to be done, but the ball is now in the hands of tweak and app developers to get started on updating their products.
* This jailbreak is progressing fairly fast, don’t you think? What are your thoughts on the entire status of the iOS 8 jailbreak thus far?
