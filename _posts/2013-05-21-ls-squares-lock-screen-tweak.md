* Folks looking to spice up their device’s Lock screen will be happy to hear that there’s a new jailbreak theme out that can help with that. It’s called LS Squares, and it adds 4 tiles to the empty space that each provide you with useful information at a glance.
* Sure, there are already hundreds of tweaks and themes available in Cydia that have similar premises. But what sets LS Squares apart from the rest of them is its sharp, Metro-like tile design that can completely change the look of your Lock screen…
* As with most themes, LS Squares requires WinterBoard. I know, that may be a deal-breaker for some, but it is what it is. This makes installing the theme very easy though—applying it is as simple as enabling it in Settings/WB and re-springing your device.
* The theme consists of 4 tiles: one for time, one for date, one for current temperature and one for local weather conditions. The clock can be set to either 12 or 24 hour format, and you can change Fahrenheit to Celsius, as long as you know what you’re doing in iFile.

* Now as for the UI of the theme, I think it looks pretty clean. The tiles are sharp, and centered (for the most part), and I really like the weather icons. The font could’ve been better, I guess, but it could have also been a lot worse. Overall, the visuals are solid.
* I don’t, however, like how notifications look when LS Squares is active. Even using Lock screen Clock Hide, push alerts look out of place. And the same goes for the music controls. While this is common in ls themes, and likely curable, it’s still worth noting.
* That shouldn’t stop you from checking it out though. I’d say LS Squares is one of 5 or 10 Lock screen themes that are actually worth installing, and seeing for yourself. If you’re interested, you can find the theme in Cydia, in the ModMyi repo, for free.
* So, what do you think of LS Squares?
