* Well known designer and mockup artist Martin Hajek released a new concept for the MacBook Pro on Thursday. As usual, Hajek’s renderings are gorgeous, and the details of the laptop design match up closely with recent rumors and reports.
* Perhaps the most prominent feature is the OLED touch panel that sits above the keyboard, in place of the function keys. The panel first popped up in an investor note from Ming-Chi Kuo, and it has since been corroborated by other sources.

* Hajek’s concept demonstrates various use-cases for the built-in touch panel, such as displaying  information and controls for third party apps, and providing access to the function keys it replaced. It could also be home to a unique Siri interface.

* Other notable details from the drawings include an oversized touchpad, which many believe could house Touch ID sensors, large speakers on either side of the keyboard and 4 USB-C ports. Two on the left side of the laptop, and two on the right.

* Again, this all matches up with what we’ve seen in alleged part leaks and other reports. So although this is only a concept, it’s possible Apple has something like this in the wings. Kuo believes the new MacBook Pro will hit stores in Q4 of this year.
