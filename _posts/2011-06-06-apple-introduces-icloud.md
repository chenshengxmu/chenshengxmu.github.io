* It’s finally here, folks! Apple has introduced and detailed the mysterious iCloud. Steve Jobs himself says that iCloud is something the company has been working on for 10 years, and iCloud has totally replaced MobileMe and added new services, such as Photo Stream.
* Details below!

* Steve Jobs,
* “We’re going to demote the PC and the mac to just be a device. We’re going to move your hub, the center of your digital life, into the cloud.”

* “So now, if I get something on my iPhone, it’s sent to the cloud immediately, and they’re pushed down to my devices automatically. And now everything is in sync without having to think about it. I don’t have to be near my Mac or PC.”
* iCloud is a syncing technology and online storage solution. Contacts, calendars, and e-mail will be synced for free to all of your iDevices.
* Just as we predicted, iCloud will be baked into just about every part of iOS 5. The iWork apps (Pages, Keynote, Numbers) will also allow you to store and sync your documents, presentations and spreadsheets with iCloud.

* iCloud will provide you with automatic backups daily, and sync your information between all of your devices. Bookmarks will even be synced across devices. The future is in the cloud!

* Did we mention that it’s free?
* “It’ll be turned on by default. We’re also giving everyone 5GB for storage of mail — and apps and books don’t count. And we’re not counting Photo Stream.”
