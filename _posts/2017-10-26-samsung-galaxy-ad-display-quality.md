* Samsung Mobile on Thursday released a nicely done commercial via its official YouTube channel, with the 30-second video touting its prowess as the creator and manufacturer of the best smartphone display technology. Good timing, by the way.
* The video is a collage of quick scenes taken from video reviews of the latest Galaxy 8, Galaxy S8 Plus and Note 8 devices done by some of the best-known YouTubers, including MKBHD’s Marques Brownlee and Unbox Therpay’s Lewis Hilsenteger.
* “So many phones are accused of all looking the same, this one actually does stand out,” says Brownlee in the commercial. The Samsung video also contains a soundbite from Unbox Therpay, saying “It’s the nicest screen ever put on a smartphone.”
* I think the ad is relevant to Apple fans because Samsung’s display-making arm is the sole producer of OLED panels for Apple’s upcoming iPhone X. And as we’ve seen with Google’s Pixel 2 XL screen woes (the XL uses an LG-made OLED panel, while the regular Pixel uses Samsung’s), no one can touch Samsung when it comes to smartphone display technology.
* What are your thoughts on this Samsung video?
