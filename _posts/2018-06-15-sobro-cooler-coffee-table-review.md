* Are you looking for a piece of furniture that’s both practical and ready to become a part of your digital world? Look no further than the Sobro Cooler Coffee Table, which is available now in the United States and Canada. 
* A few months ago, I was asked to report on the all-new Sobro Smart Side Table from the folks over at StoreBound. The table, which has now raised over $2.1 million on Indiegogo, features a wireless charging pod, quiet cooling drawer, integration with Alexa and Google Home, and a lot more, with an estimated delivery date of November.

* Impressed with the table, but disappointed I couldn’t get my hands on one yet, I turned my attention to StoreBound’s first smart furniture piece, the Sobro Cooler Coffee Table. Also successfully funded through Indiegogo, this beautiful piece is now on the market and available through the Sobro website and at many retail locations.
* I’ve had my Sobro Cooler Coffee Table for nearly two months and can’t stop talking about it to family and friends. In a word, I find it incredible.
* Available in white, black, and wood grain, the Sobro Cooler Coffee Table has been designed to be a “center for connection and comfort in your home.” And yes, it really does.
* This beautiful table offers Bluetooth-enabled speakers that you can connect to your mobile devices or, thanks to the included Bluetooth dongle, television. It also includes two USB charging ports, four power outlets, and a control panel built into its tempered glass top. With this panel, you can control sound levels, playback, and more.
* Need something more? The Sobro Cooler Coffee Table, as its name suggests, also includes a built-in refrigerator that can hold up to 32 drinks, plus multi-colored LED lights on the bottom that can add ambiance to your room. Finally, the table includes two storage drawers, perfect for objects like remote controllers, magazines, bottle openers, and the like.

* Priced at $1,499, the Sobro Cooler Coffee Table isn’t cheap. However, I think it’s worth it, given its many features. In the Sobro, you’re getting a high-quality coffee table can charge your devices and keep your favorite drink chilled too.
