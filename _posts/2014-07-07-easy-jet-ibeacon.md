* iBeacon, an indoor micro-positioning service by Apple, is among the technologies in their ascendancy. Like Passsbook, iBeacons are being slowly but surely rolled out by the ever-growing number of retailers, merchants, theme parks, sporting venues, festivals and so forth.
* A number of capable turnkey systems for easy iBeacon deployment exist today and the tiny transmitters are dirt cheap, removing an important barrier to iBeacon adoption.
* You can now put European airline easyJet on your list of iBeacon-friendly businesses.
* The British airline carrier based at London Luton Airport is operating domestic and international scheduled services on over 600 routes in 32 countries and now customers can download its freshly-updated iPhone app and opt in to receive in-app iBeacon notifications at select locations “to enhance the in airport experience”…
* Release notes only mention that easyJet with the refreshed app is currently “trialling new iBeacon technology during Summer 2014 at selected airports across the network to enhance the in airport experience.
* For those wondering – yes, the app supports Passbook.
