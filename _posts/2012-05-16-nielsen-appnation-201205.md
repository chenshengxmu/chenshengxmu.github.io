* With one in two in the United States now owning a smartphone (was 40 percent of mobile subscribers in 2011), app downloads are on the rise, too.
* Compared to last year, the average smartphone consumer in the U.S. now has 41 apps on their home screen, a 28 percent increase from 32 apps in last year, according to a Nielsen study released this morning.
* Here are the top five downloaded apps across the iOS and Android platforms…
* Nielsen’s Appnation study found out that the rise of Android and iOS users, who have more than doubled in a year, has had profound effects on the app economy with both platforms now accounting for 88 percent of those who have downloaded an app in the past 30 days.

* Here, the top five app downloads in the United States:
* 1. Facebook 2. YouTube 3. Android Market 4. Google Search 5. Gmail
* The official Facebook app remains the most-downloaded free item on the App Store, no surprises here.
* As some people pointed out, the program is actually rubbish and you could be better served by simply using a Facebook bookmark in Safari instead.
* What is surprising is the fact that four of the five most-downloaded apps in both 2011 and 2012 are by Google.
* Despite the growing number of smartphone owners, a typical user still spends approximately the same amount of time on apps each day: 37 minutes a day in 2011 compared to 39 minutes today.
* Nearly three-quarters of smartphone owners in the United States have privacy concerns with apps and more than half are wary about location sharing in apps.
* What’s your top five app list look like?
