* If you’re jailbroken and you’re a fan of the classic Space Invaders arcade game by Tomohiro Nishikado, then you’re going to love this new Cydia release.
* SpringInvaders is a fun new jailbreak tweak available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository starting today for $0.99 that lets you play the popular classic Space Invaders game with your Home screen app icons.
* SpringInvaders is a cool new take on the popular Space Invaders arcade game from the 1970’s. The tweak uses icons from your Home screen to theme the enemies and your weapon fire.

* The game is controlled easily – you tilt your device left or right to control the movement of your ‘springship’ at the bottom of the screen, and you tap on the screen to fire your weapons at incoming enemies. You can also tap and hold to charge up what the developer is calling a ‘springbomb,’ which is many times more powerful than the basic firing mechanism you use to take down enemies.
* You’re given 5 lives, and you lose a life whenever you don’t kill an enemy in time and it gets too close to you. Level by level, you’ll move through the game at your own pace. Each level gets progressively harder, but nevertheless, if you manage to hit an enemy you’ll earn 10 points, but if you miss, you’ll lose 5 points for each shot missed.
* SpringInvaders adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure the game’s options your own necessity.

* All of the things you can configure from this preferences pane are:
* SpringInvaders is an entertaining way to pass the time and I think it’s a very good re-make of the popular classic arcade game Space Invaders. The controls are relatively easy to use, being accelerometer and touch-screen based, but some sensitivity adjustments may be necessary to tailor this tweak to your own individual skills.
* It’s worth mentioning that the game runs very smoothly on any device, including our aging iPhone 5. With that being said, game-play isn’t hindered at all by performance and you can expect it play the same for you. Our GIF image doesn’t do the game’s fluidity justice.
* Although you could download a game from the App Store to pass your time instead, I think SpringInvaders offers a unique game play experience mostly because you can open it from anywhere in iOS using Activator and because it uses the app icons of the apps you have installed on your device to provide you with game details.
* Compatible with jailbroken iOS 8 and 9 devices, including the iPad, SpringInvaders is ready for almost anyone that wants to play the game. It even works in landscape mode just as well as portrait mode on supported devices.
* Obviously, if you’re not into games, then you probably won’t enjoy SpringInvaders. If you fall into this category… move along.
* If you’re interested in playing SpringInvaders on your jailbroken iOS device, then give this tweak a try. You can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
