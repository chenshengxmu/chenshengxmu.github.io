* Apple just finished introducing its next iPhone (yeah, they went with the iPhone 5 moniker) by saying that iOS 6 will be released for public consumption on September 19, a week from now and three days before the iPhone 5 is due to hit store shelves. The sixth major revision to Apple’s mobile operating system is a free upgrade to owners of the iPhone 3GS/4/4S, fourth-generation iPod touch and iPad 2 and 3. Not all features are supported on all devices so you’ll want to check out our handy compatibility matrix..
* As for the iPhone, Apple is taking pre-orders beginning this Friday, September 14. The device will begin shipping in the Unites States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore on September 21.
* This means you will have three days between iOS 6 and iPhone 5 availability to update your existing devices.
* Is history is an indication, you won’t want to update to iOS 6 on the launch day as Apple’s activation servers could easily experience heavy load.
* By the way, the 16GB iPhone 4S just dropped to $99 and the 8GB iPhone 4 is free, both with a qualifying two-year contract.
* The iPhone 3GS?
* It’s a goner.
* Will you be updating to iOS 6 on next Wednesday?
