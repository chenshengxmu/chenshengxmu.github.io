* You no longer need a dedicated app to turn webpages or your photos into PDF documents on your iPhone or iPad. That’s because Apple has conveniently added a new item to the system-wide Share menu which permits you to do just that, right out of the box and in seamless fashion.
* In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to save a webpage as a PDF document using Safari on your iPhone or iPad.
* Step 1: Launch Safari on your iPhone or iPad and visit any webpage you wish to save as a PDF document.
* Step 2: Tap the Share icon (it looks like a box with an arrow jumping out of it) to access iOS’s multi-purpose Share menu.
* Step 3: Now choose Save PDF to iBooks in the top row.

* Tip: If you don’t see this option, swipe to the rightmost part in the top row of icons, hit More and toggle the option so it appears in the Share menu.
* Step 4: The currently visited webpage will be turned into a PDF document and automatically imported into iBooks and saved to your iBooks PDF shelf.
* You can then launch the iBooks app to access your PDF. From there, you can obviously read the PDF document, or you can share it via email.
* This feature isn’t available through in-app browsers in third-party apps. More importantly, Apple’s implementation lacks any options for modifying how PDFs are created, compressed and saved, which is a bummer.
* Basically, you’re stuck with sending webpages to iBooks, from which they can be shared via just two export options: Email and Print.
* There are many ways saving webpages as PDFs might come in handy.
* For starters, you might want to save a webpage as a PDF in order to attach it to an email message. I’ve been building a personal archive of various web resources in the PDF form for years and can envision using this nifty little feature on a daily basis.
* But why stop there? You can use this in select third-party apps that implement iOS’s native Share controls and work with content that can be exported as PDF.
* For instance, I was able to save combined iOS screenshots from the LongScreen app as PDFs. And in Camera+, photos you take can be exported to iBooks as PDFs.
* No matter how you look at it, it does feel like Apple’s implementation of this feature has some untapped potential. With that in mind, here’s hoping Apple adds more versatility to the PDF creation process so we can control how these PDFs are created and, most importantly, where they’re being saved.
