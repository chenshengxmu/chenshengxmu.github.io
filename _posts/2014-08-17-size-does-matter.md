* O.K., I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not about that. When you find out a little bit more about this game, you’ll see how apropos the name really is. Sometimes, you just have to go with what works.
* Size DOES Matter is a rhythm game where… well, size matters. Players control a series of blocks that can shrink and grow in order to fit into different sizes of gates. Don’t crash into them or you’ll lose everything.
* The game is rhythm based, but you won’t have to tap to the beat. Instead, players swipe up and down on the screen in order to lengthen or shorten a series of blocks to fit them perfectly between a gate.

* Players first choose a song, of which there many composed by electronic music celebrities that have lent their talents to such games as Super Hexagon, Ridiculous Fishing, and more. As soon as the song begins, a gate will appear on the screen and pass from right to left in landscape mode.
* Your job is to resize your blocks so that, as you pass the gate, you don’t crash into it. Not only do you have to worry about the size of your blocks, but you also have to pay attention to where they are located on the screen. If you are too high or low, you’ll miss the gap and crash.
* To move the blocks up or down, swipe your finger in that direction on the left side of the screen. To shrink the blocks, swipe down on the right side of the screen. To lengthen the blocks, swipe up on the right side, as well.
* Those are the basics, but the game gets going pretty fast fairly quickly. You’ll have to manage size and movement while soaring through gate after gate in a rhythm based experience. If you make it through a gate successfully, you’ll increase the point multiplier. The first time you crash, you’ll lose the multiplier and have to start over.

* As the game progresses, gates will appear more frequently and even move around. So, you may think the next gate is wide, but suddenly, a small one will move up faster and you’ll have to shrink down quickly.
* Players also pick up power ups to help make the game easier, like slow-mo mode, which slows everything down so you can maneuver through gates easier.
* Size DOES Matter is available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for $0.99. Download it in the App Store today.
