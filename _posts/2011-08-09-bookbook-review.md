* Rarely do I find myself getting overly excited about something as mundane as a phone accessory, a case no less.
* The thing is, this isn’t just any accessory, it’s the accessory. In fact, it might just be my favorite iPhone accessory of all time. It’s elegant, it’s functional, and it lends peace of mind and simplicity to a life that can seem overly complicated at times.
* In my opinion, the hallmark of a great product isn’t merely based on its technical merit, its precision, or its beauty. It’s a combination of all of those; but most importantly, a great product is one that you don’t have to think about, it’s just there for you when you need it to be.
* That’s what makes the Twelve South BookBook case so good. It’s extremely practical and functional. It has that old school organic class that’s so hard to come by in the silicon world that we’ve found ourselves forced into. Dare I say it’s the James Dean of iPhone accessories; strikingly handsome, a bit gritty, with Oscar winning capabilities. Check out our full video review after the break…
* As you can tell, the BookBook case has found favor in my eyes. I love the fact that I can have all of my important items together: my license, debit cards, credit card, cash and phone, all in one place. No more having to juggle multiple items, I know it’s all here.

* The case feels perfect in your hands. It really does feel like you’re reading a book of sonnets, but instead, of course, you’re catching up on your latest RSS feeds.
* The BookBook case is a surefire head turner, a definite conversation starter, it’s a hit around my neck of the woods.

* If there’s one gripe to make about this case, it’s the obvious: There’s no hole for the rear facing camera. Understandably, that might be a deal breaker for those of you who snap a lot of spontaneous photos.
* Even those of you who are always removing their iPhone from the case might find that the BookBook poses a problem in that area. Sure, it’s made of high quality leather, and the stitching seems strong, but it can only hold up for so long until the leather and the surrounding begins to weaken from the constant insertion and removal of the iPhone. So far so good on this end, but when you consider as many videos as I take, it seems inevitable.

* Those few gripes aside, the BookBook is the perfect iPhone 4 case. It’s quite steep in price at $59.99, but again it is high quality genuine handmade leather. Trust me when I tell you you’re getting your money’s worth. Besides, we might give away one BookBook case to a lucky iDB reader, so stay tuned.
