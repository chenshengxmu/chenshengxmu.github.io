* User excitement for iOS 7 continues to mount, as we are now less than 48 hours away from the public release. The update includes a number of new features, like AirDrop and Control Center, as well as an all-new UI design.
* But there’s one big change coming in iOS 7 that continues to fly under the radar, and that’s support for third-party game controllers. In fact, it’s been discovered that Apple is already approving games with controller support…
* Touch Arcade reports:
* “I really hate that we’re reduced to this level of Apple tea leaf reading, but, here we are. If you’re among the boatload of our readers who are totally excited for iOS 7 game controllers, here’s some good evidence that they might be coming sooner rather than later: Apple is now approving game updates that specifically support controllers. AVP: Evolution [$0.99] is the first one that has popped up on our radar.”
* The site notes that since this is one of the first games they’ve seen thus far with support for the new controller API, it’s still unclear how widespread this will become. AVP: Evolution could either be the first of many, or an oddity.
* Back in June, it was reported that Apple was working directly with accessory-makers Logitech and MOGA to produce a new line of iOS gaming peripherals. Shortly after that, a photo surfaced claiming to be of an early prototype.

* Of course, controller support isn’t the only new gaming feature iOS users have to look forward to. The iPhone 5s, Apple’s new handset, has a 64-bit processor that has already proven to offer a substantial boost in graphic performance.
* It’ll be interesting to see where we’re at when all of the dust settles—say 6 months from now. Here’s hoping by that time we have widespread game support for third-party controllers and the 64-bit A7, and a new Apple TV.
