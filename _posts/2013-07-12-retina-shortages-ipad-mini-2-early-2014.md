* While supply chain sources appear to agree that a fifth-generation iPad is launching this Fall, pointing to Apple’s procurement of components ahead of trial production, there is no definite consensus on a successor to the 7.9-inch iPad mini.
* A new report out from Taiwan on Friday asserted that Retina panel shortages may have forced Apple’s leadership to push back the device into early-2014.
* Tim Cook & Co. have reportedly scrapped the original plan which called for launching the iPad mini 2 during the fourth quarter of 2013, in time for the holiday shopping season…
* This information was reported on by Taiwan’s Economic Daily News, via MacRumors. The story alleges Apple may even introduce both Retina and non-Retina versions of the iPad mini 2.
* The sentiment echoes that of May’s NPD DisplaySearch report calling for two Retina iPad mini 2 models, one in the second half of this year and another in the first quarter of 2014, sporting a faster chip.
* Apple pulled a similar maneuver last year when unveiling the iPad 4 with Lightning I/O and a faster A6X chip just six months following the iPad 3’s introduction.
* Back in April, the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo similarly told clients “technical challenges” would probably push back the second-generation iPad mini until September-November timeframe.
* Likewise, on Monday the hit-and-miss Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes wrote Apple is “still adjusting” the new iPad mini as Apple’s engineers reportedly face challenges in terms of the impact of the power-hungry Retina Display on battery life.
