* Officially unveiled at the 2018 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple yesterday released an upcoming Shortcuts app for developer testing, and iDownloadBlog took it for a spin.
* The Workflow-like software lets you connect shortcut operations to Siri, making complex tasks as simple as speaking a custom voice command. As a matter of fact, Siri Shortcuts is both an app and a dedicated section in the Settings app on iOS 12 under Siri & Search.
* TUTORIAL: How to create Siri Shortcuts and make your life easier
* Any app on iOS 12 can work with Siri and expose user actions to the system.
* This permits Siri intelligence to suggest an action at just the right time, such as ordering a coffee in the morning or kicking off your afternoon workout routine.
* But first, take a look at our hands-on video walkthrough of Siri Shortcuts.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* You will use the Shortcuts app to create a series of actions from different apps that can be carried out with a simple tap or a customized voice command.
* Developers can take advantage of this new capability using Shortcut APIs.
* Based on Workflow, a powerful iOS automation app Apple acquired last year for an undisclosed sum, Siri Shortcuts will be included in the commercial release of iOS 12 this fall.
* With custom shortcuts set up in the Shortcuts app, customers can even ask Siri on their HomePod to execute complex home automation scripts on other devices.
* I’m very excited for Siri Shortcuts.
* How about you?
