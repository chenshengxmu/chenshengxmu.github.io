* Apple has been on a roll this week with software updates, seeding iOS 5.1 beta 2 to developers and iTunes 10.5.2 to the masses. Now the company has just released two more software updates for iOS devices.
* The first is for the Apple TV 2, bringing the device to iOS 4.4.4. The update appears to just contain minor improvements, as no new features have been discovered yet. And the second is for the iPhone 4S.
* No, it’s not iOS 5.1. It actually just appears to be a slightly tweaked version of iOS 5.0.1. The build number shows up as 9A406, which is slightly different than the original 5.0.1 release (9A405).
* Whatever the changes are, they’re obviously not major ones. Users already on iOS 5.0.1 aren’t seeing the new software. But if anyone on iOS 5 or lower goes to download the firmware they’ll get the new build.
* MacRumors believes that it has something to do with the international iPhone 4S launch tomorrow. There’s also the chance that the update includes security fixes, so jailbreakers who aren’t already on iOS 5.0.1 should be cautious.
* We’ll keep you updated.
* For the folks that have downloaded the above-mentioned updates, have you noticed any changes?
