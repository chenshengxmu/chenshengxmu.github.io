* The iPod touch 6th generation may have taken forever to finally arrive, but it took almost no time for the boys and girls over at iFixit to give it a proper teardown.
* As we noted in yesterday’s full review of the 6th-gen iPod touch, this device is a marked improvement over the previous generation, and features the same powerful A8 processor as the iPhone 6, and double the RAM of the 5th-gen iPod touch. But that’s not all that’s new in this refresh. Be sure to check out iFixit’s teardown for a full breakdown of all of the music player’s components.
* Here’s a listing of all of the technical components found inside of the new iPod touch:
* • Apple A8 APL1011 SoC + SK Hynix RAM H9CKNNN8KTMRWR-NTH 1 GB LPDDR3 RAM • Toshiba THGBX3G7D2KLA0C 128 Gb (16 GB) NAND flash • NXP LPC18B1UK ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller (M8 Motion Coprocessor) • InvenSense MP67B 6-axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer • Universal Scientific Industrial 339S0231Wi-Fi Module • Broadcom BCM5976 Touchscreen Controller • Texas Instruments 343S0645 Touchscreen Controller • Apple 338S1116 Cirrus Audio Codec • NXP Semiconductors 1610A2 Display Interface Controller • Texas Instruments 6573 Power Management IC
* Ultimately, the device was hit with a repairability score of 4/10. That’s not very good, but it does beat the lower 3/10 score posted by the 5th-gen touch.
* Now that you’ve gotten the chance to let the arrival of Apple’s new iPod touch sink in a bit, what are your thoughts on the device? Does the confirmation of the extra RAM and the faster processor move the needle for you?
