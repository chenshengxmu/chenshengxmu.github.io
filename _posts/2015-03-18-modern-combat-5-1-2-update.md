* In addition to going free for the first time (regularly a $4 value), a barrage of new features have been added to Modern Combat 5 in a brand new Spring update to Gameloft’s excellent war shooter (an App Store Best of 2014).
* Now available in the App Store, Modern Combat 5: Blackout version 1.2 finally supports ‘Made for iPhone’ game controllers, both form-fitting and extended variants.
* There’s a brand new multiplayer mode available called Zone Control in which you must capture and defend areas to boost your score. Other improvements include new weapons and character classes and additional character customization.
* Another surprise, aside from the price drop: all the current players are getting Veteran status, with unlimited energy for life — and some other goodies like 200 credits and Veteran-exclusive kills sign and camo — as a thank you for their support.
* The all-new Support class is designed to give your team backup. Support soldiers will drop medical kits to heal allies, boost your own stats and permit your teammates to respawn from the last spot.
* Each class now has an extra weapon tier and Support class gets a new Light Machine Gun weapon category. New character customization features include weapon camos, a bunch of new masks, skills, kill signs, and solo/squad logos.

* Modern Combat 5: Blackout 1.2 highlights:
* New soldier class: Support
* New Weapon Class: the Light Machine Gun (LMG)
* New weapon tier
* New multiplayer game mode: Zone Control
* MFi controller support
* New character customization options
* Server updates
* As for the switch to free-to-play, it’ll give the game a much longer shelf life while allowing Gameloft to invest more in the long-term update plan and in the servers which need to support a significantly larger player base.

* The 723.6-megabyte update is free for existing players.
* Modern Combat 5: Blackout is available free in the App Store.
