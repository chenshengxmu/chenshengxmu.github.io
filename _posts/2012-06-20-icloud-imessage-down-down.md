* In line with several reports, readers are telling us that they are experiencing difficulties accessing iCloud and sending iMessages this afternoon. We are noticing similar problems on our own devices.
* Judging by recent Twitter chatter, the outage appears to be world-wide, affecting a number of users. Apple has acknowledged the problem on its iCloud status page, but there’s no ETA for a fix…
* Users are reporting problems accessing all of iCloud’s services, as well as the website. And we haven’t been able to get an iMessage to go through for the past hour. The current message on Apple’s support page reads:
* “iCloud services — Users Affected: Some.
* Users may be unable to access iCloud services. Normal services will be restored ASAP.”
* Apple has been having intermittent issues with iCloud over the past week, with reports of iCloud Mail and Photo Stream being down for some users. Perhaps it has something to do with the service’s rapid adoption.
* iCloud was only introduced to consumers 7 months ago, and already it caters to nearly 130 million users. Nevertheless, that doesn’t excuse Apple for the outages. Its customers have certainly come to expect better.
* Update: Apple has updated its iCloud status page, stating that all services are back online after 4 hours of downtime.
* Have you been having problems with iCloud or iMessage today?
