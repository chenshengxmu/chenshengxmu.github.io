* Apple has seeded the second OS X 10.9.2 beta to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The release comes nearly a month after the first beta, which was posted on December 19.
* The new build is available to registered developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what specific changes are coming in the update, or when it’ll be available. But Apple has asked devs to focus on Mail, Messages, Graphics Drivers and VoiceOver.
* The first beta added support for FaceTime Audio in Messages and FaceTime apps. Today’s build is labeled as version 13C39, and we will be sure to let you know of any notable changes.
