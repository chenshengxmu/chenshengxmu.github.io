* Apple today posted a comprehensive list of the top iTunes sellers in 2012, ranging from e-books and podcasts to television shows and movies to apps and songs. The charts representing the best iTunes content in 2012 list the top sellers for every iTunes category. Paid and free apps are listed separately, and then again for the iPhone and iPad. Go past the fold to see if your favorite apps made it on the list…
* The full list is available via this iTunes link and covers Apple editors’ picks as well as the best-selling free and paid Mac and iOS apps, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Books and Podcasts.
* As you can see for yourself, Apple’s iPhone App Of The Year is Action Movie FX, an awesome movie effects app from Bad Robot Interactive.
* The program turns your iPhone into a bonafide action movie-maker, allowing you to add high-quality digital effects to your videos like explosions, car crashes and two dozen others.
* As for the iPad App Of The Year, Apple chose Paper by FiftyThreee, a drawing and sketching software that many people think borrows a few clues from Microsoft’s never-released Courier tablet project.
