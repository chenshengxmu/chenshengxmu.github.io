* San Francisco, California headquartered wearable products company Jawbone on Monday released a brand new Up software for the iPhone in the App Store (not to be confused with the firm’s existing Up app).
* Announced earlier in the month, the app features iOS 8 HealthKit integration, personalized fitness advice and other features, but without requiring Jawbone’s UP or UP24 fitness band.
* The app lets you share Up’s food, fitness and sleep tracking data with iOS 8’s Health app, and vice versa. Jawbone has opened up its platform to third-party development so more than a hundred health and fitness applications and accessories for the iPhone and iPad now integrate with Up, with or without HealthKit, including Strava Running & Cycling, Wello, IFTTT, RunKeeper and MyFitnessPal.
* By tracking your activity, diet and sleep, the software can adapt to your habits and provide personalized fitness advice, powered by Jawbone’s Insight Engine. Once connected to Health on iOS 8, the app will use your available steps and sleep data that the motion chip inside your iPhone 5s or later automatically collects on your behalf.
* “With step tracking, workout logging and Insight Reports, UP is way more than a pedometer,” developers noted in release notes. “Add friends to your team to cheer and be cheered”.

* You can also use the app to monitor weight and set custom alerts to get reminded when it’s time to get moving, take your medicine, hit the bed and more.
* For instance, iPhone users can set alerts with UP for specific activities like taking medicine, starting a workout, or preparing for bed. UP also helps monitor weight and other information with goals and social aspects to the app as well.

* The app can also track food with features like frequent meals, an enhanced calorie counter, an expanded library of restaurant menus and a Food Score providing an at-a-glance overview of your general well-being.
* Key highlights:
* The 78.3-megabyte download is available free of charge in the App Store.
* Jawbone’s other Up app recently picked up several interesting features such as weight management, caffeine intake tracking and sleep analysis.

* Note that Health is not supported on iPads.
