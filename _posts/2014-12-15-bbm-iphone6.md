* BlackBerry is rolling out a new version of BBM for iOS with support for Apple’s latest iOS 8 mobile operating system, native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, the ability to send stickers in a group chat and more.
* “You can’t help but notice the sleek and modern design updates like a flat UI and attractive transparencies,“ boasted Canada’s embattled company. The overhaul makes the app look sharp across supported Apple devices.
* As mentioned above, your messaging experience in BBM just got souped up with the addition of big, bold stickers in groups. Speaking of stickers, all paid BBM sticker packs are currently 99 cents for a limited time.
* Over time, BBM has picked up quite a few useful features. For example, the last update added timed messages so you can now set how long contacts have access to messages and pictures shared in a chat, in a manner similar to other ephemeral messaging apps out there.
* Moreover, today’s BBM 2.6 update has introduced an enhanced timed messaging option with the ability to set a message sending timer that lasts up to 60 seconds, up from just fifteen seconds before. The increase lets your friends see these timed messages and pictures multiple times until the timer expires.

* Next, no longer do images sent via a chat appear fuzzy because the app now transfer images in high resolution.
* Another cool feature: message retraction. As the name suggests, BBM makes it possible to retract a message to remove it from your BBM chat so you won’t embarrass yourself realizing a fraction of a second too late that you sent a message to the wrong person.
* Here’s message retraction in action.
* Timed messaging and message retraction are available at no cost through the end of January, after which these premium features will become part of a BBM subscription.
* BBM 2.6 for iOS and Android was announced over the weekend and should be rolling out later today. Oh, and folks who use Android will be happy to know that BBM now supports Android 5.0 Lollipop and has a brand new landscape mode.
* Grab BBM for free in the App Store.
