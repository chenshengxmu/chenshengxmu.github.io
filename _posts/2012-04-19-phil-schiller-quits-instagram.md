* If you couldn’t believe those hipsters who stopped using Instagram just because it sold out to Facebook for a staggering $1 billion, wait ’till you hear this.
* Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president, apparently stopped using Instagram because the photo sharing service recently expanded to Android.
* It’s hardly a surprise, if you think of it. Schiller, a prominent figure in Apple’s public presentations, has been a member of the company’s executive leadership team since Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997.
* Being in charge of worldwide marketing at Apple and an active Twitter user, Schiller would be foolish to continue supporting a hugely popular service that up until recently used to be an iOS exclusive…
* That must have hurt Schiller’s feelings.
* According to a post over at 9to5Mac, a reader has discovered that Schiller deleted his @schiller account on Instagram. The executive clarified the decision in a private message to the reader, saying he stopped using the immensely popular photo sharing service because:
* It “jumped the shark” then it went to Android.
* Not much to be said about this, with the exception that Schiller is no ordinary user.
* Being one of the public faces of Apple and a high-ranked executive in charge of marketing means moves like this are always scrutinized and send a certain message.
* Contrast this to a pair of his earlier tweets that clearly promoted Instagram.
* “@therealpavell: @pschiller Hi! What iPhone apps do you use to edit your photos?” > Aperture on Mac. Best Camera and Instagram on iPhone.

* Congrats to @foofighters @instagram and all the iTunes Rewind 2011 winners! (btw: @schiller on Instagram ;->)

* To me, the message is loud and clear: iPhone users, stop supporting Instagram, our app of the year!
* Dunno.
* Maybe I’m overblowing this, but this is my take.
* What’s yours?
* Should have Schiller stayed an Instagram user regardless of the fact the service expanded to Android?
