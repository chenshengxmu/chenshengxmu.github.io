* Ahead of their high-profile trial, scheduled to start in March, Apple and Samsung have submitted a list of all of the patents they are accusing each other of infringing, and applicable devices. Well this is a pared down list, trimmed by each side at Judge Koh’s orders.
* This is the second time the two will meet in Koh’s northern California courtroom. The first time around, Samsung was found guilty of infringing on a few Apple patents and was forced to pay close to $1 billion in damages. This time, there may be even more at stake…
* As we told you back in January, Apple has already won a small victory in the proceedings. In a preliminary hearing, Judge Koh tossed one of Samsung’s patents out and found it guilty of infringing on one of Apple’s patents, so neither will need to be seen by the jury.
* But FOSS Patents has posted a list of the patents and alleged infringing devices that did make it (via AppleInsider):
* Patents
* -U.S. Patent No. 5,946,647 for a “System and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data” – Claim 9  -U.S. Patent No. 6,847,959 for a “Universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system” – Claim 25  -U.S. Patent No. 7,761,414 for “Asynchronous data synchronization amongst devices” – Claim 20  -U.S. Patent No. 8,046,721 for “Unlocking a device by performing gestures on an unlock image” – Claim 8  -U.S. Patent No. 8,074,172 for a “Method, system, and graphical user interface for providing word recommendation” – Claim 18
* Products
* -Admire  -Galaxy Nexus  -Galaxy Note  -Galaxy Note II  -Galaxy S II  -Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch  -Galaxy S II Skyrocket  -Galaxy S III  -Galaxy Tab 2 10.1  -Stratosphere
* Patents
* -U.S. Patent No. 7,756,087 for a “Method and apparatus for performing non-scheduled transmission in a mobile communication system for supporting an enhanced uplink data channel” – Claim 10 -U.S. Patent No. 7,551,596 for a “Method and apparatus for signaling control information of uplink packet data service in mobile communication system” – Claim 13 -U.S. Patent No. 6,226,449 for an “Apparatus for recording and reproducing digital image and speech” – Claim 27 -U.S. Patent No. 5,579,239 for a “Remote video transmission system” – Claims 1 and 15
* Products

* It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out, as Samsung and Apple are involved in multiple patent wars around the globe. The two companies have tried on multiple occasions to reach an out-of-court settlement, but those efforts have yet to yield any type of positive results.
* Samsung did recently reach an agreement with Google though, regarding patent rights. The two tech giants have agreed to a 10-year cross-licensing deal that covers all current and future technology patents—including all of those Motorola patents Google kept after the sale.
* At any rate, the Apple-Samsung trial is scheduled to kick off March 30. Stay tuned.
