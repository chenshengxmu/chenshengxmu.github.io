* Pandora, the popular streaming-music service and one of the rare few Internet radio apps that saw a surge in listening following September’s iTunes Radio debut, has been updated this morning with a pretty useful alarm clock feature which lets you start your day to your favorite music with your own choice of Pandora stations. Pandora 5.1 for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad includes refreshed iOS 7 design and other improvements “to make your listening experience even better”.
* Jump past the fold to learn more about the alarm clock feature…
* One of the most-oft requested features, the new alarm clock in Pandora 5.1 lets you pick one of your favorite stations to wake up to. After the alarm goes off, you can either keep the music playing or hit the Snooze button should you need to kill a few extra minutes before getting out of bed in the morning.

* You should use the alarm clock capability with the sleep timer to “listen to music you love morning and night,” release notes state.
* Pandora Radio is free in the App Store.
* The download weighs 32.6MB and supports iDevices running iOS 5 or later.
* You’ll of course need a paid subscription which can be purchased in-app: $0.99 for monthly listening or $3.99 a month for the Pandora One tier, which removes advertising and lets you enjoy higher quality audio.
