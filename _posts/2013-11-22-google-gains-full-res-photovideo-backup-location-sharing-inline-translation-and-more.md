* The search monster Google has posted another update to its Google+ app for the iPhone and iPad, this time bringing a new iOS 7 perk: the ability to upload your iOS Camera roll photos and videos automatically and in glorious full resolution, to a private album on Google+ Photos, viewable only by you (unless specified otherwise). This brings the iOS app to parity with its Android counterpart.
* It’s really useful because your photos get sent to the cloud in the background, even if you haven’t opened the app. You could previously enable Camera backup in Google+, but this would not back up full resolution images and the app would upload for only a few minutes after it quit.
* It’s a very interesting addition that turns the Google+ thing into a viable cloud backup of your iOS Camera roll. This Google+ update comes with other tweaks and nice-to-haves so jump past the fold if you’re interested to learn more…
* The full-resolution photo/video backup is an iOS 7-only feature.
* Other enhancements contained in Google+ version 4.6 include UI tweaks, location sharing, inline translation and “additional bug fixes and performance improvements”.
* Wouldn’t it be great if Google+ could automatically translate foreign language posts? No problem: whenever the app detects a post or comment that needs translating, it’ll tap the power of Google Translate to deliver inline translation, which is pretty neat.
* And if you’re OK with letting others where you are, you can do that, too.
* Simply tap the new Locations item in the slide-out panel to  share your geographical location, search for nearby places, see where your friends are and even control who is displayed on the map (see the top left screenshot).
* This is similar to Apple’s own Find My Friends app and basically replaces functionality previously offered by Google’s standalone location product.

* Before wrapping up, let me just comment on the usefulness of full-res photo backup.
* Google currently gives you 15GB of free cloud storage space shared between Drive, Gmail and Google+ Photos. You can of course buy additional storage space, with prices ranging from five bucks per month for an additional 100GB and all the way up to an insane $800 per month for sixteen terabytes of cloud storage.
* Google’s 15GB free tier is a far cry from Yahoo, which recently upgraded every Flickr account to 1TB of free storage for full-res photos. The equivalent 1TB tier for Gmail, Drive and Google+ Photos sets you back a painful $50 per month so Yahoo’s photo service remains the best value there is.
* Here’s the complete changelog of Google+ version 4.6.
* – Full resolution backup of your photos and videos (iOS7 only) – Updated design for the notification tray – Share your location, see where your friends are, control who is displayed on the map – Translate posts and comments inline – Additional bug fixes and performance improvements
* Google+ is free in the App Store.
* The universal app weighs 27MB and is supported across all iOS 6 or later iDevices.
