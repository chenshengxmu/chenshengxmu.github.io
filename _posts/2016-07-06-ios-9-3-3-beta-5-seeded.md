* Two weeks after seeding a fourth beta of iOS 9.3.3, Apple today released a fifth beta of the mostly bug-fix software update to members of the Apple Developer Program and public beta testers signed up with the Apple Beta Software Program. The new software is available as an over-the-air update on devices running a prior beta of iOS 9.3.3 through the Software Update mechanism in Settings. Apple also released tvOS 9.2.2 beta 5 to its registered developers and OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 beta 5 to developers and public beta testers.
* iOS 9.3.3 beta 5 (build number “13G34”), tvOS 9.2.2 beta 5 (build number “13Y825”) and OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 beta 5 (build number “15G26a”) can be downloaded via Apple’s Dev Center and installed on devices with a proper Apple configuration profile installed.
* As we’re now on a fifth beta of iOS 9.3.3, it’s reasonable safe to conclude that a public release is around the corner. Don’t get your hopes high though: as mentioned, iOS 9.3.3 is mostly a bug-fixe release as Apple tries to tie up a few loose ends and turn its full attention to iOS 10.
