* In general iOS 5’s new notification banners are a good thing, but sometimes they wear out their welcome. Unfortunately, there’s no built-in method to quickly dismiss a notification banner, you just kind of have to wait until it decides to disappear.
* That sounded like a job for the jailbreak community to tackle, and indeed they did. The result? NCQuickDismiss…
* NCQuickDismiss puts a little ‘x’ icon in the upper right-hand corner of the banner notification, and tapping it causes the banner to quickly fade from view.
* There’s also an included provision that places an ‘x’ in the bottom right-hand corner of Notification Center itself, so if you don’t feel like sliding up to dismiss it, you can rely on the ‘x’ to do the dirty work instead.
* If you’re jailbroken and running iOS 5, you can find NCQuickDismiss on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Sound appealing?
* Note: @hrbrt just sent me a Tweet informing me that you can quickly dismiss banner notifications without a jailbreak by simply swiping from right to left. I never knew this, but it totally makes sense. Thanks!
* Here’s the video evidence. Some are reporting that this doesn’t work for them, so beware:
