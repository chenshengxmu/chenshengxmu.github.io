* It’s no secret that posting a purposed “spy shot” of Apple’s upcoming smartphone will bring all of the skeptics out of the woodwork. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the photos have a tendency to be a little on the fake side.
* Advances in image-editing software have made producing a realistic-looking “leaked photo” extremely easy. How easy? Jesus Diaz of Gizmodo made the above image in under 10 minutes…
* Not only did the tech blog draw up an impressive graphic of a slimmed-down iPhone, they were also able to track down the origin of the “iPhone 5” photo that was supposedly snapped in the office of a French operator.

* Look familiar? The image that was posted by the MacRumors forum member this morning was actually tweeted by Robin P yesterday. Wondering what the accompanying French text means?  “A picture like this could drive some sites crazy.”
* That doesn’t necessarily confirm or deny the photo’s legitimacy, but you can draw your own conclusions. At any rate, the photo makes for an interesting conversation piece. Will the next iPhone look like this, or more like the clone that recently surfaced?
* What do you think?
