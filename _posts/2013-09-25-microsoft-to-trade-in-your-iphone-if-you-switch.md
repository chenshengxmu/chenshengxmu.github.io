* Microsoft has been running its #timetoswitch campaign for some time, to mixed results. The multi-pronged effort spans television, print, online and social media channels as Microsoft positions Windows Phone as the next big thing.
* Part of that effort is a recent iPad trade-in campaign seeking to steal sales from Apple by inviting iPad users to trade-in their tablet for up to $200 in Microsoft Store credits. That’s just the tip of the iceberg: Forbes writes today that Redmond is prepping to add the iPhone to the promotion…
* Owners of an iPhone 4s or iPhone 5 in good working condition will be able to grab a minimum of $200 in store credit. The offer should be valid across select Microsoft stores in the United States and Canada.
* According to the Forbes story:
* According to an inside source at Microsoft, Microsoft Stores will begin giving a minimum $200 in-store credit for iPhones on Friday as part of its “#timetoswitch” campaign, obviously hoping consumers will use the cash to buy a Windows Phone.
* Of course, Microsoft won’t trade-in your iPhone just for the heck of it, you’ll be required to switch to a Windows Phone handset.

* The iPhone trade-in offer is a clever move designed to cunningly incenitivize folks to visit their brick-and-mortar stores, some of which are located just across Apple’s own outlets.
* That’s not saying Microsoft will succeed.
* Apple tends to have some of the most ardent fans so loyal followers are unlikely to trade-in their iPad or iPhone at a Microsoft Store, especially given other places such as Gazelle offer far better deals.
* Besides, Apple Stores as of recently offer Apple’s official iPhone trade-in program.
* Recently, Microsoft launched an online campaign to let folks trade in any Apple, Android or Blackberry Device for a Visa gift card. The program is open to “anyone that’s ready to trade up to an amazing new Microsoft device,” Microsoft says.
* I’m just wondering what’s Microsoft going to do with all those ditched iPhones?
