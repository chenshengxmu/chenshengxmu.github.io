* Apple’s streamlining, redesigning and flattening efforts go beyond iOS 7 or Jonny Ive’s title. Today, the company has issued a major revamp to its iCloud.com Beta website. The enhanced experience focuses on an all-new yet familiar look which takes more than a few clues from iOS 7, to put it mildly.
* But rather than draw snippets of inspiration from the forthcoming iOS 7 refresh, Apple has taken it upon itself to actually recreate the complete iOS 7 look and feel, right in your web browser and down to the flattened icons, minimalistic look and light fonts.
* I’ve taken a bunch of screenshots so do check out the full gallery right below…
* Right below is your new iCloud Home screen.
* That background is taken from iOS 7, by the way. It’s animated smoothly on my mid-2011 MacBook Air, right in the Safari browser – it’s pretty incredible. Just don’t try turning your Mac upside down or shake it.

* Check out the Account section.

* You gotta love the circular selector in the profile image manager.

* I also love the time zone selector (below). For those wondering, iCloud web apps feature web notifications but you can’t mute these yet like in OS X or iOS.

* The iCloud Mail is fast and responsive.

* Check out the “app switcher”, it looks great! Notice the new Home button which takes you right back to your iCloud Home screen. Again, just like in iOS. Streamlining, indeed.

* iCloud Contacts, just like in iOS 7.

* Of course, there’s a reason they’re calling it iCloud Beta.

* Your new iCloud Calendar.

* iCloud Notes, one of my most often used stock apps.

* Clicking the down arrow in iCloud Reminders reveals all your completed tasks. Plus, there’s a handy button to delete all the tasks I’ve completed to keep my reminders clean and uncluttered.

* Find My iPhone opens with a nice compass animation as the web app is busy locating my devices. Strangely enough, Find My iPhone still uses Google Maps tiles.

* Linen background in iWork apps? Boom, gone!

* Of course, iWork for iCloud apps now support rich editing capabilities, here’s Pages.

* And Numbers. Not everything is in place yet. “Chart editing is coming soon,” a notice reads.

* And Keynote.

* Even the error page has to be beautiful!

* All told, I’m sure you’ll agree this is very well done. I’m curious as to whether this apparent streamlining of iCloud web apps indicates the possibility of a flat OS X down the road.
* There’s no escaping the fact that OS X Mavericks is a mixed bag of clean and skeuomorphic design (we’re looking at you, Reminders!) as Apple surely isn’t done yet with the de-Forstallization of the Mac operating system.
* Oh, wait…
