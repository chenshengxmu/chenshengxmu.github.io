* NCInstaCall is a jailbreak widget for iOS 5 that allows you to make phone calls directly from Notification Center; hence, the “NC” in NCInstaCall.
* The purpose of the tweak is to allow you to dial your friends from anywhere. The fact that Notification Center is accessible from anywhere in iOS 5 makes this possible.
* Take a peek at our video synopsis of NCInstaCall inside…
* Once installed, just head over to your Settings app and enable the NCInstaCall widget in the Notifications panel.
* It’s not the prettiest tweak in the world, but in a pinch it gets the job done. NCInstaCall can be downloaded for free on Cydia. You must have a jailbroken iPhone in order to do so.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
