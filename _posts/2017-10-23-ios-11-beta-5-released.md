* Apple on Monday seeded the fifth beta of its upcoming iOS 11.1 update for iPhones and iPads, as well as the fourth betas of tvOS 11.1 and macOS 10.13.1. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* Apple literally seeded beta 4 a few days ago, so we aren’t expecting many changes in today’s release. But thus far, iOS 11.1 is shaping up to be a nice update with hundreds of new emoji from the Unicode 10 spec and the return of the 3D Touch app switcher. Check out our hands-on video below.

* We haven’t seen any major changes in the first several betas of tvOS 11.1, suggesting that the update is more focused on under-the-hood performance improvements and bug fixes rather than new user-facing features.
* Similarly, macOS 10.13.1 seems to be all about performance improvements. However, as with iOS 11.1, this update will also include the new Unicode 10 emoji.
* See any notable changes in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
