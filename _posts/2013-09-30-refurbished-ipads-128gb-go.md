* Folks in the market for a high capacity-model iPad will be happy to hear that Apple has begun offering refurbished versions of its 128GB tablet in its web store at a nice discount.
* Over the weekend, the top-end storage model for the fourth-generation iPad popped up on the company’s website, in a variety of configurations, at up to $140 off their original prices…
* At the time of this writing, Wi-Fi models in both black and white are available with estimated shipping times of 5-7 business days. There’s also a white AT&T model shipping in 5-7.

* The Wi-Fi only version of the 128GB tablet will run you $679, and the + Cellular $789. As noted by MacRumors, that’s the cheapest either has been since they launched earlier this year.
* For those unfamiliar with Apple’s refurbishing program, it’s very highly regarded. Portable products like the iPad get a new back and battery, and come with the usual one-year warranty.
* Of course, we’d recommend holding off buying a tablet if you can, for at least the next couple of weeks. Apple is expected to unveil new versions of both the iPad and iPad mini in October.
