* Monday, U.S. wireless carrier Sprint announced Direct 2 You, an industry-first new service that sends a retail-trained Sprint expert to your home or other location who will deliver and set up your iPhone or other device, promising to change how customers buy or upgrade their phones, tablets and other mobile devices.
* In addition to bringing a mobile device to your own home, office or other location of your choice, Sprint’s experts will set it up on your behalf and transfer all the content, including contacts, pictures, videos and apps, from an old device to a new one, simplifying switching from one platform to another.
* “The experience also includes the Sprint expert performing a tutorial and offering tips to help the customer become familiar with using the new mobile device,” said the firm.
* To make this possible, the carrier will invest in a car fleet comprised of five-thousand Sprint Direct 2 in major metropolitan areas by the end of the year, potentially creating up to 5,000 new jobs nationwide.

* These experts are particularly skilled in helping customers make the switch from a phone using the Android operating system to one running on Apple’s iOS, or vice versa, the company said.

* Here’s how Direct 2 You works:
* The initiative is launching first in Sprint’s hometown of Kansas City today and will be available to upgrade-eligible customers. It will then launch in Chicago and Miami markets, with expansion nationally expected to follow throughout 2015.
* In other Sprint news, the company has doubled the number of retail stores, thanks to General Wireless’s acquisition of Radio Shack, with a total of 1,435 former RadioShack stores now co-branded as Sprint-RadioShack.
