* Tonight, 9to5mac points us to two new TV ads being aired by Apple. The thirty second advertisements show off Siri, and are titled “Road Trip” and “Rock God”…
* The first ad, RoadTrip, shows off Siri’s awesome location features.
* The second, Rock God, shows how Siri can be used on a day-to-day basis. The ad highlights Siri’s dictation feature for both notes and text messages, along with results from Wolfram Alpha.
* Do you think Apple’s advertising is affective?
