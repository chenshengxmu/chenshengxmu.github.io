* Is 64GB just not cutting it for you? Then you might be interested in this RT from iOS hacker iH8sn0w a few moments ago. It questioned the possibility of seeing 128GB iDevices in the near future, due to a new system partition key size in the iOS 6.1 BuildManifest.
* Curious, I decided to investigate this file for myself. After extracting the iOS 6.1 beta and comparing the SystemPartitionPadding values with older 6.0.x firmware, it became clear as to what @iNeal, the author of the original tweet, was referring to.
* While this doesn’t set anything in stone, it certainly lends evidence that Apple may be seriously considering up-sizing its next batch of iOS devices this time.
* We should be seeing 128GB iDevices soon. iOS 6.1 beta 5 has 128G system partition key in BuildManifest.

* Here are a couple of screenshots I snapped comparing the key values from the beta 6.1 firmware, and the public 6.0 firmware:

* Notice the field labeled SystemPartitionPadding. As you can see, this field has an additional 128 key, which opens up the possibility of seeing 128GB iOS devices.
* What do you think? Would you consider shelling out a few extra dollars for double the highest amount of space you can buy with current iOS models?
* Again, thanks Neal.
