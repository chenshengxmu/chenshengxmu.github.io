* Alongside public releases of the iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, tvOS 10.2.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.5 software updates for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, Apple earlier this morning also posted a minor update to iTunes for Mac and Windows PCs.
* iTunes 12.6.1 contains only minor app and performance improvements, according to Apple’s release notes.
* A security document reveals that the app fixes a WebKit exploit on Windows 7 and later which may allow arbitrary code execution after processing maliciously crafted web content.
* “Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling,” Apple states. The vulnerability was discovered by the user “lokihardt” of Google Project Zero.
