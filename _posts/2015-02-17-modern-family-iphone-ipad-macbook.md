* Re/code is reporting that an upcoming episode of ABC’s popular television sitcom Modern Family was shot entirely on iPhone and iPad cameras and will play out entirely on a MacBook screen, showing exchanges between characters who use FaceTime to communicate among themselves.
* The forthcoming episode, titled “Connection Lost,” was shot entirely on an iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2 and is scheduled to air at 9pm next Wednesday, February 25, on ABC.
* The plot involves Claire Dunphy using email, FaceTime, Facebook and other tools to locate her eldest child after getting stuck in an airport
* Apple furnished iPhones for the episode, but did not pay for product placement, said Steven Levitan, the show’s creator and executive producer
* Everything displayed on the screen had to be mocked up in order for the footage to look realistic and readable on TV sets.
* The production teams worked for months to “create a replica” of OS X Yosemite “painstakingly updated with every revision to the software”.
* “We got to populate extra jokes that you won’t catch on in first viewing,” said Megan Ganz, Modern Family’s co-executive producer and writer.
* Modern Family back in 2010 aired an episode in which Phil Dunphy is eagerly awaiting the original iPad’s introduction.
* Levitate knew the device was coming out so he reached out to Apple.
* “One day, a couple of months before it came out, a guy came down with the iPad,” he recalled. “Outside of captivity at Apple, we were among the first people in the country to ever touch it.”
