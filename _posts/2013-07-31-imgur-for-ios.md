* Soon after users on Reddit and Digg began spreading viral images through it, Alan Schaaf’s image-sharing service Imgur blew up in no time.
* Be it funny images that’d gone viral, animated GIFs or simply the fact that it was conceived (in 2009) from the onset as an image hosting service that didn’t suck – users are now uploading more than a million images to Imgur every day.
* Announced for iOS (and released on Android) back in June, the official Imgur iOS app finally hit the App Store early-July. At least that’s what AppShopper says – earlier today, I received a media release celebrating the app’s iOS launch so…
* Much like the beloved web service, the iOS app allows you to browse the ever-growing collection of viral images, comment and vote on them, upload your own photos and lots more…
* With the Imgur app, users can also manage their Imgur account and albums right on their iOS device and submit images directly to the Imgur gallery.
* As mentioned in iTunes reviews, Camera roll exports aren’t supported and you can’t access sharing features for animated GIFs from album view.
* Following on the initial release, the team last Friday issued the first update with fixes for third-party logins, image swiping and gallery submission process. The new version 1.0.2 is also noticeably faster, has native sharing and updated UI “for better uniformity in iOS”.
* Speaking of UI, the iPad interface (below) looks weird – it’s almost like those blown up smartphone apps on Android.
* Hopefully the next update fixes that.

* I’d also appreciate an in-app purchase to remove ads.
* The Imgur website is receiving an unbelievable 3.5 billion monthly page views and now claims more than 70 million unique monthly visitors.
* If you’re willing to give the app a try – because you want to test-drive another image-sharing service or simply dive into the wonderful world of the Internet’s most viral memes – download it now free to your iPad, iPhone and iPod touch from the App Store.
