title: Dev Team Quietly Updates RedSn0w
---
* Earlier today, the Dev Team quietly updated the jailbreak tool RedSn0w to version 0.9.9b2. This update doesn’t bring much to the table but the usual bug fixes and enhancements.

* Among those enhancements, RedSn0w 0.9.9b2 brings better firmware detection for the Verizon iPhone, and improves on recovery, stitching, and blob processing…
* A couple weeks ago, the Dev Team gave RedSn0w a makeover. The tools is now more powerful than ever. I invite you to take a video tour of the new RedSn0w, and learn more about SHSH blobs stitching.
* As usual, you can download RedSn0w from our downloads section. If you’re new to jailbreaking or would like to learn more, please make sure to visit our jailbreak page.
