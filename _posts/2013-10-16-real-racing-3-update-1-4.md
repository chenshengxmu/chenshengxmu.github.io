* Electronic Arts posted a significant update for its popular Real Racing 3 title today, bringing the game to version 1.4. The update includes a number of additions, including new cars, a new track and new HUD customization options.
* The new cars come from the Ferrari family, meaning you can now get behind the wheel of the FF, the 458 Italia, and the V12-powered F12berlinetta. And the new track is Spain’s Circuit de Catalunya, famous for its sweeping turns…
* Here is the full change log:
* Real Racing 3’s garage is bolstered by the introduction of highly requested cars from iconic Italian manufacturer, Ferrari.

* Today’s update comes a little over a month after the previous Real Racing release, which added 7 generations of Porsche vehicles as well as improved iOS 7 compatibility and a new feature for faster car upgrades called VIP Delivery.
* As you know, Real Racing 3 is a ‘freemium title,’ meaning it’s free to play, but you’ll be encouraged to snag some in-app purchases. Regardless, the game is well-reviewed, and can be found in the App Store for free if you’re interested.
