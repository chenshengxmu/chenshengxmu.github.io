* Last week we heard a rumor that AT&T was going to start unlocking out-of-contract iPhones over the weekend. And sure enough, on Sunday we were able to confirm that this was indeed the carrier’s new policy. We even showed you how to do it.
* So now that you’ve unlocked your handset, you’re probably wondering what the benefits are. Well aside from the improved resale value and the ability to use your iPhone abroad, you can take the device with you to another, less expensive, carrier.
* In fact, it sounds like T-Mobile would welcome you with open arms…
* A T-Mobile spokesperson just gave the following statement to 9to5Mac:
* “Today we have more than one million unlocked iPhones running on our network. T-Mobile currently offers microSIMs for customers who already have a GSM phone they want to use on the T-Mobile network, including an iPhone. In order to set up an unlocked iPhone on T-Mobile’s network, customers simply need to purchase a microSIM card and select a T-Mobile Value plan that suits their needs.
* T-Mobile’s Value plans enable customers who bring their own smartphone, such as the iPhone, to save money. For example, T-Mobile’s Value family plan with unlimited talk, unlimited text and unlimited data with 2 GB of high-speed data is just $49.99 per line for two lines.
* In addition, we will continue to deliver more value to customers as we expand and modernize our 4G network. Beginning this year, we will introduce HSPA+ service in our 1900 MHz PCS spectrum. When we do, our 4G network will be compatible with a broader range of devices, including the iPhone.”
* It’s worth noting that the iPhone experience on T-Mobile’s network isn’t 100% native. Some users have reported problems with MMS and due to incompatible technologies, most unlocked iPhone users only see 2G data speeds.
* But hey, for the savings, it might be worth it.
