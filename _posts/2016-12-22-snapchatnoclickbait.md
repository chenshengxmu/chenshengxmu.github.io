* Snapchat is one of the world’s most popular ways to send photos and short video clips to friends, but it also comes with additional clutter inside the app that many users feel they could really do without. Among said clutter are the clickbait-like links in the Stories Tab.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called SnapchatNoClickbait will help clean up the Snapchat app of all that junk for anyone who’s tired of looking at uninteresting links and information.
* The tweak is pretty straightforward; once you install it, it gets to work immediately by clearing the unwanted stuff from the app. You may need to force quit and restart the Snapchat app after installation for its magic to take effect, but once it does, you’re left with a clean and clutter-free interface, as shown above.
* The tweak removes sections like “Featured” and “Live” from the app’s Stories Tab, but leaves the button for adding to your own story and still lets you view your friends’ stories without any interruption.
* Without all that (what most people would consider junk) cluttering up the Snapchat app, you can focus more on what matters to you, such as sending and receiving stuff, chatting, and the stories of you and your friends without using something that feels like it’s riddled with ads.
* There are no options to configure after you install the tweak, and if you ever wanted to bring these features back to the Snapchat app, all you would need to do is uninstall the tweak from Cydia.
* SnapchatNoClickbait works with the latest version of the Snapchat app, which as of this writing is version 9.45.2.0 and can be downloaded for free from the App Store if you’re not already using the app.
* If you’re interested in using SnapchatNoClickbait on your jailbroken iPhone, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Keep in mind that any time you use a jailbreak tweak for a third-party service’s app, you are always gambling with their terms of service; use jailbreak tweaks of any kind at your own risk.
