* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Framed. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the popular puzzler for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $4.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* The concept alone bowls us over. You’re rearranging panels in an interactive comic book—changing the outcome on each page until your sneaky spy avoids danger. But Framed’s puzzle play isn’t the only thing that thrilled us. We got so caught up in the suspenseful story and moody visuals, all we could think about at the end was giving it another go.
* And here is a trailer for the game:
* Framed is available in the App Store for free.
