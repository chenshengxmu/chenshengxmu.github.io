* Isnâ€™t it weird that the stock Messages app doesnâ€™t automatically convert ASCII smiley faces into Emoji icons?
* I never understood why Apple neglected to include this feature; I think they should have at least made it an option.
* Thanks to the jailbreak community, now it is an option, and that option is called SMSmileysâ€¦
* SMSmileys is a tweak thatâ€™s simple and straightforward. When you install it, it will automatically convert all textual renditions of smiley characters into Emoji icons.
* So, â€˜;)â€™ will look like a real winky face, and â€˜:Dâ€™ will genuinely look happy.
* SMSmileys is a free download on Cydiaâ€™s BigBoss repo. Try it out for yourself and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
