* Folders are incredibly useful for managing cluttered Home screens, but their core design hasn’t changed much in some of the most recent iterations of iOS.
* If you’re looking for a completely redesigned folder experience in iOS 11, then we encourage you to check out a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed CoolFolder by iOS developer 4nni3.
* As we’ve illustrated in the screenshot examples above, CoolFolder replaces the folder’s traditional blur effect with something you might find to be a bit quirkier: outlines.
* Indeed, CoolFolder traces the perimeter of every Home screen folder with a sleek and customizable outline. The outlining effect presents itself from both the Home screen and within the folder itself.
* After installation, you’ll find a new preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure the aesthetic to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a helpful Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane for saving any changes you make to the tweak’s settings.
* By changing CoolFolders’ corner radius and outline color, it’s possible to devise some rather fascinating aesthetics with various wallpapers. Case in point:

* If you’re interested in trying CoolFolder for yourself, then you can pick it up for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
* Are you a fan of the outline effect imposed by CoolFolder? Let us know in the comments section below.
