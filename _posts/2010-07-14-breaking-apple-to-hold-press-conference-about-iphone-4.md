* Well, it took Apple just about 3 weeks to react to the negative press they were getting about the iPhone 4 antenna issue. Apple sent an invite to a few tech journalists for a press conference this Friday, and while it’s not clearly said the conference will address the “Antennagate”, one can only assume this will be the topic of choice.
* The fact this problem was brought to the mainstream when Consumer Reports said they don’t recommend the iPhone 4 is probably the reason why Apple is having a press conference on this matter. The conference will be this coming Friday, at 10am PST.
