* Beginning Wednesday, February 1, T-Mobile will offer existing and new U.S. customers a prepaid MasterCard with a new smartphone purchase, the carrier announced this morning. The promotion includes every new smartphone that T-Mobile sells, including various iPhone models. In oder to qualify for the deal, you must activate your new smartphone on T-Mobile’s ONE or Simple Choice Unlimited 4G LTE plan.
* The prepaid card is worth 11.2 percent of your smartphone’s retail price, will take 6-8 weeks to arrive and must be redeemed within 30 days. The amount on the prepaid card should cover at least what you paid in sales tax, said the company.
* For customers who live in Puerto Rico, T-Mobile will offer a prepaid MasterCard worth an even higher 11.55 percent of their smartphone’s retail price. Up to twelve lines can qualify for this time-limited deal, the carrier has said.
* T-Mobile’s Tax Rebate promotion, which launched earlier in the month, gives switchers a $150 prepaid MasterCard, no device trade-in required.
* And it gets even better: the Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier recently launched a what-you-see-is-what-you-pay initiative, where the advertised prices of its new ONE plans now include sales taxes and all other monthly fees. “You know the old saying about death and taxes? We’re taking on taxes first,” said T-Mobile CEO John Legere.
