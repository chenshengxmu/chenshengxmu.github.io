* Hot on the heels of its FaceTime over cellular press release, AT&T has made another interesting announcement. The carrier will soon be offering a nice little subsidy on many of its tablets.
* Starting Friday, November 9th, AT&T will knock $100 off the price of its iPads and other slates for folks willing to sign a two-year data plan agreement. Keep reading for more details…
* Here’s the press release (via The Next Web):
*  “Just in time for the holiday shopping season, AT&T* today announced it is offering a promotional discount to tablet customers.  Beginning Friday, Nov. 9, customers will receive $100 off any tablet purchased at an AT&T company owned store or online at www.att.com or at selected agents or retailers with a two-year data plan agreement.
* Tablet customers can choose from several qualifying data plan options, including adding a tablet to an AT&T Mobile Share plan for just $10 per month.  With Mobile Share, customers share a single bucket of data – from 1GB up to 20GB – with other devices, including smartphones, tablets, gaming devices, and more.”
* The only stipulations are that you must sign a two-year contract with the carrier, and likely face a termination fee for canceling, and pick from one of the following data plans:
* – AT&T Mobile Share: $10 to share between 1 GB and 20GB
* – AT&T DataConnect 250MB: $15 for 250MB
* – AT&T DataConnect 3GB: $30 for 3GB
* – AT&T DataConnect 5GB: $50 for 5GB
* I’m not sure about AT&T’s strategy here — the $100 subsidy pales in comparison to the [minimum] $360 you’ll end up spending in data plan fees over the next 24 months. But I guess if you’re sure you’re going to need that wireless data for two years, the extra discount is good news.
* It’ll be interesting to see how consumers respond to this new tablet subsidy model, especially with the holidays coming up. I’m not sure the end cost is worth the discount.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
