* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that iPhone 8 will be switching to an all-glass design akin to iPhone 4 with a stainless steel metal frame rather than aluminum. Today, trade publication DigiTimes shed more light on the matter.
* Quoting supply chain sources, the report states that Apple will adopt a stainless steel forging process for the new chassis frame instead of the traditional CNC machining process although the metal frame will need to be further refined by CNC machining.
* Component orders will be shared between iPhone manufacturer Foxconn and US-based supplier Jabil, both of which supplied a stainless steel frame for iPhone 4.
* The two reinforced glass panes and the metal frame manufactured using the forging process will result in enhanced sturdiness while reducing costs and manufacturing time.
* That’s because the cost of the forging process is between thirty percent and fifty percent cheaper than the current unibody CNC machine process.
* Quality control is more stable with the forging process, too.
* iPhone 8 should be assembled by Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron, the report states.
