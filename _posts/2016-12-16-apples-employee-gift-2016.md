* Apple this year is giving each of its retail employees a special edition t-shirt and credo printing gift for the holidays. MacRumors has photos of the presents, which show a gray t-shirt featuring a two-circle design made up of all of Apple’s retail locations.
* As for the credo, it’s printed on what appears to be glossy, heavy paper and it even comes in a protective envelop. Apple introduced the 6-paragraph statement earlier this year, which starts off “we are here to enrich lives, to help dreamers become doers.”

* While the gift is a nice gesture for the holidays, it’s a bit of a step-down from Apple has given its employees in recent years. For example, in 2015 it handed out urBeats headphones and an Apple Music subscription, and in 2014 it gave out backpacks.
