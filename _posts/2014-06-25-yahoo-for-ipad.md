* Yahoo’s main iOS client is great. Not only does it double as a portal to Yahoo’s key mobile apps and services, it’s basically a handy one-stop shop for copious amounts of curated and original news content summarized by Yahoo.
* With articles available across twelve distinct categories – News, Business, Celebrities, Entertainment, Finance, Health, Media, Politics, Science, Society, Sports and Technology – it’s easy to get accustomed to firing up the app on mornings and skim through headlines before getting out of bed.
* I generally tend to avoid reading news on the iPhone’s tiny screen whenever possible so you could imagine I’m really glad that Yahoo’s software has finally leaped onto the iPad…
* Aside from iPad support, the refreshed application features integration with Digital Magazines and has been enhanced with snapshots of local weather, news digest, stocks, sports, popular photos and videos.

* I’m liking the snapshots: no longer do I have to switch to the Yahoo Weather app just to see if I’m going to be needing a raincoat today!
* Download Yahoo 5.0 in the App Store.
* Again, the app will now run natively on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad devices compatible with iOS 7.0 or later.
