* Apple on Tuesday seeded brand new betas of the iOS, tvOS and OS X operating systems to members of the Apple Developer Program. iOS 9.3.2 beta 4 (build 13F68), tvOS 9.2.1 beta 4 (build 13Y772) and OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 beta 4 are all available for download on devices running earlier betas. Standalone installers can be downloaded through Apple’s Dev Center for developers and are also available for public testing for members of the Apple Beta Software Program.
* These latest betas are mostly bug-fix and maintenance releases—with the exception of iOS 9.3.2 which lets you use Night Shift and Low Power Mode at the same time—so don’t expect much in terms of any outward-facing feature additions.
* We are investigating what’s new in Apple’s latest pre-release operating system updates and will report back as new information becomes available.
