* Earlier this year, Kodak completed the sale of more than 1,000 digital imaging patents in an effort to help restructure the company after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It wanted $2 billion for the portfolio, but only garnered $500 million from a group of companies.
* That consortium consisted of several tech giants, including Google and Apple. And according to a new report, their names are starting to turn up on transfer filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, meaning Kodak’s patents are changing hands…
* AppleInsider reports:
* “Filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office revealed on Tuesday that the transfer of a number of patents from Kodak to Apple has begun, with the iPhone maker taking ownership of several patents covering aspects of digital photography.
* Thursday saw the filing of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,432,479, 8,432,472, 8,432,456, and 8,432,461. The patents in question cover measurement of range using a zoom camera, displaying and sharing digital images, and wireless sharing of digital images via a network.”
* It’s hard to say what Apple’s exact plans for the patents are, but at the very least they’ll be able to use them to help defend their products against would-be litigators. Practically every device that the company produces has at least one, if not two, built-in digital cameras.
* The good news, though, is that it would have a hard time using them to start an patent war with other tech companies, considering most of its major rivals were a part of the winning group. They, along with Kodak, will all have licenses to the stack of digital imaging IP.
* Speaking of digital imaging, Apple is set to unveil its next-generation iPhone 5S later this year, and one of its major improvements over its predecessor is expected to be its new camera system. Word has it that it’ll have a double LED flash and up to a 13MP sensor.
