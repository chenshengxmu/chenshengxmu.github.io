* Back in January of this year, rumors were swirling about the possibility of Near Field Communications (NFC) technology being a part of the iPhone 5.
* It’s been assumed that Apple will use the technology to allow its users to make mobile transactions, a wallet replacement of sorts that eliminates the need to carry around physical credit cards.
* Now it seems like those rumors may have been a bit premature, as Apple dismisses the idea of NFC appearing in its next iPhone…
* As we mentioned in our previous rumor article earlier this year, Apple would face an uphill battle with NFC due to the lack of a clear standard, and the fact that many of the world’s retailers may be hesitant about adopting the new technology.
* A source mentioned in an article that recently appeared in The Independent had this to say: “The new iPhone will not have NFC, Apple told the operators it was concerned by the lack of a clear standard across the industry.”
* That’s not to say that Apple will never adopt the technology, as previous hiring patterns and patent applications show that they are clearly interested in NFC.
* Are you disappointed about the rumored lack of NFC in Apple’s next iPhone?
