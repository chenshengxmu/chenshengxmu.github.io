* It’s been a while since we heard anything on the Apple smartwatch front so today’s report by the Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes (I know, don’t start) asserted that the iWatch is at least a year away. Specifically, the publication claims that the iWatch is expected to release in the second half of 2014.
* The device is expected to retail for between $149 and $229. More details right after the break…
* According to DigiTimes, Taiwan-based contract manufacturer ODM Inventec is expected to land as much as an CIMB Group-estimated sixty percent of iWatch orders and contribute to about nineteen percent of Inventec’s profits in 2014.
* The analyst expects Apple’s iWatch to be priced between US$149-229 and consumers will purchase the device mainly to replace their iPods.
* Replace their iPods?
* Replace a music player with a smartwatch, seriously?
* DigiTimes, pinch of salt, you know the drill.
* For what it’s worth, an analyst with CIMB Group said iWatch shipments will hit an estimated 63.4 million units in 2014. Analyst Katy Huberty wrote back in February that the iWatch would present Apple with an $80 billion opportunity , assuming it sells at least 50 million units at an average selling price between $200 and $300.
* This could drive an incremental $10 to $15 billion in revenue, or $2.50 to $4.00 in per-share earnings, each year. Besides Apple’s iWatch, a Samsung executive today officially confirmed that the South Korean conglomerate will be introducing its Galaxy Gear wearable concept device with a non-flexible display at the upcoming September 4 event.
