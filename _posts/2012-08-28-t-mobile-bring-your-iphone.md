* It’s starting to look more and more likely that T-Mobile will once again not be receiving an iPhone nod from Apple this year, making it the last major carrier in the US without the handset.
* But it’s not going to take this lying down. Recently-leaked flyers show that the carrier is about to launch a “Bring Your iPhone to T-Mobile” campaign, with an emphasis on plan price.”
* TmoNews reports:
* “T-Mobile’s efforts to bring unlocked iPhone customers into stores certainly seems to be heating up as we just got our hands on some flyers that may be apart of T-Mobile’s marketing strategy. The flyers are pretty simple, showing the savings T-Mobile customers will discover when they leave pesky AT&T behind.”
* The flyers come at an interesting time, as AT&T just launched new controversial Shared Data plans, which many folks believe will raise their bills. And T-Mobile, on the other hand, just announced a new set of unlimited data plans, which as you can see, are far less expensive.
* In addition, yesterday it came to light that T-Mobile was planning on releasing 4G microSIM cards for unlocked iPhone 4 and 4S. So despite not being an official partner, the carrier is obviously hoping that if it plays its cards right, the handset will bring it new customers.
* “For those of you who don’t think the iPhone on T-Mobile’s network is a boost or will draw customers, a four-store pilot (which is where the flyers originate from) in an east-coast area tells us that’s in fact, not the case. A trial-run undertaken during the course of July in four retail locations showed that gross adds increased 56% over the regular store baseline when a live iPhone running on T-Mobile’s 3G network was demonstrated.”
* The last statistic we heard put unlocked iPhones on T-Mobile in the 1 million range, but we’re assuming it’s much higher than that at this point. And with the carrier working hard to update its network to be more iPhone-friendly, that number should continue to grow.
* So let’s see here: upgraded network, a new public push for unlocked iPhone customers, and all new unlimited plans? It seems like T-Mobile is making all the right moves here. But whether or not it will amount to a slew of new subscribers is still yet to be seen.
* What do you think?
