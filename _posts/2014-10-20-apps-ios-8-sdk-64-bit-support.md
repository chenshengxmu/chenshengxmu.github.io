* Apple sent out a notification to developers today, giving them a heads up on a few upcoming changes to its App Store submission policy. Posted in its developer portal, the bulletin says that beginning in February of next year, iOS applications must meet two new requirements.
* Starting February 1, 2015, new apps and updates must be built using the iOS 8 SDK (software development kit), and they must include 64-bit support, otherwise they will be rejected. Apple made a similar announcement around this time last year for iOS 7 app optimization.
* The 64-bit support is of particular significance for folks with newer devices. Apple introduced its first 64-bit processor, the A7, last year with the iPhone 5s and iPad Air, and it refined things this year with the A8. Both chips offer significant performance gains while using less power.
* That Apple is requiring the use of the iOS 8 SDK is also good news, as it should help motivate developers to update their apps. Apple won’t be pulling apps already on the App Store after February 1st, but all updates submitted after that date must comply with the new rules.
