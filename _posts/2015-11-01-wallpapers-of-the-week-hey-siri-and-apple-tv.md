* This past week, Apple launched the new generation Apple TV. Pre-orders began to arrive Friday, October 30 and a plentiful supply of stock was available in Apple Stores. Two new features for the device include Siri enhanced search and navigation, along with new time lapse motion screen savers.
* To commemorate the occasion, the included images are inspired by Siri and Apple TV in this Wallpapers of the Week installment. Take a step inside for a plethora of download options, including Apple Watch and iPad Pro sized images. 
* This week we are featuring graphic artist @JasonZigrino, who has been churning out timely designed wallpapers for the past couple weeks. You can follow his work more closely via dribbble.
* The new Apple TV uses time lapse motion screen savers when interactivity ends. High resolution video plays on the connected TV, instead of the old photo album-based images. Earlier this week, we featured an article about how to make the Apple TV screen savers an option on your OS X devices.
* Below, you can see the screen saver cities are listed as downloadable options. The opacity in the wallpaper covers the images derived from Apple TV video snippets. Before firing off a comment below, the actual imagery from the Apple TV screen savers cannot easily be turned into photo realistic wallpapers themselves, because the screen saver is based on live-streamed video from Apple’s servers. Consequently, grabbing a screenshot of the video would result in poor quality wallpapers.
