title: iPad mini unboxing
---
* I went to several Walmart’s last night at midnight in search of the elusive iPad mini, but alas, no dice. Fortunately I already had one ordered from the Apple Store as a backup plan.
* I literally just received my mini in the mail via FedEx about 30 minutes ago. As always, I could hardly contain myself, but I made myself wait before tearing open the box so I could showcase this unboxing on video for you guys.
* Have you received your iPad mini yet? What do you think about it thus far? Stay tuned, as we’ll have tons of comparison articles and videos in the coming hours and days.
