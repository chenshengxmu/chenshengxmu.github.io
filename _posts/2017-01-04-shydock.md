* In macOS, you can configure your application dock to hide away and only appear when you need it, so wouldn’t it be nice to bring that kind of functionality over to your iPhone or iPad as well?
* With a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed ShyDock, you can hide or show your app dock on demand with a simple Activator action.
* After the tweak is installed on your device, you can head over to the Settings app where you’re going to find a preferences pane with a few options you can configure:

* You’ll see an animation duration text field, which lets you modify how long the hide and show dock animation will be whenever you invoke the tweak. We’ve found that 0.25 seconds is a sweet spot, but if you like animations, you might opt for a slightly longer duration.
* You’ll also find three Activator gesture selectors:
* There’s no reason to respring your device after changing any of these settings, so once you change a setting, you’re all set to use the tweak however you might have configured it.
* Once you head back to the Home screen and you want to hide or show the dock with Activator, you’ll see the following animation, which is similar to that of macOS:

* In terms of when you might use this tweak, it seems like something along these lines would stand out most to themers. Those who really want to see the full effect of their wallpaper interacting with their Home screen icons will enjoy being able to hide this clutter from the Home screen until they really need it.
* If you’re interested in downloading ShyDock and trying it on your jailbroken device, it’s available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now. The tweak is designed for iOS 9 devices and requires Ryan Petrich’s Activator extension to be used.
