* Joining its existing range of various lens attachments and special cases for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Olloclip on Wednesday announced a new Active Lens accessory that combines a telephoto lens with an ultra wide-angle lens.
* The pocket-sized accessory requires no extra parts, can be snapped on both front and rear-facing cameras and ships with three wearable pendants to keep your lens safe and within arm’s reach.
* The ultra-wide lens is especially handy for taking dramatic panoramic landscapes, but should prove just as useful for snapping group selfies on the front FaceTime camera.

* If you’d rather photograph professional-looking portraits with a narrower depth-of-field, simply switch to the Active Lens’ telephoto lens that lets you get twice as close to the action.
* The company claims that the Active Lens uses precision coated ground glass optics which should deliver “superior clarity.” The accessory works with all photo and video apps.
* It’s really cool that the Active Lens can be paired with the Ollocase, the company’s protective case for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* And if you own an Apple Watch, you can use the built-in Camera Remote app, or a Music Glance, to trigger your iPhone’s Olloclip-enhanced camera remotely.

* True iPhone photography buffs may also want to get a mini tripod such as the Case Star Octopus tripod, which makes wide-angle shots easier because you can wrap its legs around just about anything and get the best possible shot.
* The $99.99 accessory is now available for pre-order on Olloclip.com.
