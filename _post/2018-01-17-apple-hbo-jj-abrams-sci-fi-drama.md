* “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” director J.J. Abrams has written a new science fiction drama television series that’s reportedly the subject of a bidding war between Apple and HBO.
* Warner Bros. Television would produce the show. Warner Bros. is said to be open to other bidders, but HBO and Apple are currently the top contenders for the yet-to-be-named project.
* Variety has the story:
* Details of the project are being kept under tight wraps, but it would reportedly deal with a world’s battle against a monstrous, oppressive force. Should the project move forward, it would be Abrams’ first TV writing gig since ‘Fringe’ in 2008.
* Abrams would also executive produce.
* According to The Hollywood Reporter, the untitled space-set sci-fi drama is about family.
* Sources say the Abrams drama is about a family—consisting of a mother who works as a scientist, her husband and their young daughter—who all get into a terrible car crash. After the mother winds up in a coma, her daughter begins digging through her experiments in the basement and winds up being transported to another land amid a world’s battle against a monstrous, oppressive force. Her father then follows her into this new world.
* Ben Stephenson, who is the head of television for Abrams’ Bad Robot Productions, may also serve as an executive producer for the show.
* Abrams wrote, produced and directed “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” executive produced “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and will produce, write and direct “Star Wars: Episode IX.” He also counts the ”Cloverfield” and “Star Trek” franchises among his credits.
* Abrams was involved in multiple television series in the past few years as well, having created such shows as “Felicity” and “Alias,” co-created the “Fringe” and “Lost” series and executive produced “Westworld” at HBO, “Roadies” for Showtime and the upcoming “Castle Rock” at Hulu.
* The prolific writer, producer and director is currently working on a new “Star Trek” flick, which will reportedly be produced alongside Quentin Tarantino.
