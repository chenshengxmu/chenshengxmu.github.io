* A few people have been experiencing an unusual drain of their iPhone battery after unlocking with UltraSn0w. The problem doesn’t actually come from UltraSn0w itself, but from the hacktivation process, for those of you who have hacktivated instead of activating the phone with an official carrier.
* According to BigBoss, the issue comes from iOS 4.1 and 4.2.1 which constantly look for valid push certificates, either via wifi or your data plan (Edge or 3G). If you’re not on an unlimited data plan, this can get pretty expensive, especially if you don’t keep an eye on it.
* There are 3 potential solutions for this…
* Have you experienced that?
