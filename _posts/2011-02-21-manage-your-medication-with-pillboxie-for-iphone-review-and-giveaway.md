* If you take a lot of meds, you know how much of a pain it can be to manage all of your prescriptions. Unless you’ve got a steel trap for a memory, it can be difficult to remember when to take all of the different pills in your medical arsenal.
* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was an easy to use, pretty app for managing your meds on the iPhone? The developer and designer of Pillboxie (who is also a registered nurse) thought so too. If you’re a pill popper, this one’s for you…
* Pillboxie’s official description,
* “Pillboxie is the easy way to remember your meds. Other med reminder apps are either too complicated or just downright boring. Pillboxie is easy because it lets you *visually* manage your meds. Scheduling a reminder is as easy as dropping a pill into a pillbox.”

* Pillboxie is one of those rare apps that looks as good as it performs. It’s like the ideal girlfriend: pretty, easy to figure out, functional and hassle free.
* The goal of Pillboxie is to help you remember when to take your meds. There aren’t a lot of settings to configure; you simply create a new med and drop it into the appropriate pillbox. Each pillbox represents an hour in the day.
* Pillboxie will send you a local notification when it’s time to take your medication. This is great because you don’t need to be on a network to get your reminders, so Pillboxie works on the iPod Touch as well.
* After you create a new pill, you select it from your virtual pill cabinet and schedule it for the appropriate time of day. Dragging pills into the pillbox is actually an enjoyable process. The act of flipping a pillbox lid open, dragging a pill in, then flipping the lid down again feels very intuitive.

* Adding a new med to your pill catalog is very straightforward. Simply add the name and choose from a combination of 40 different pill shapes and colors. Once added, a pill is ready to be scheduled from the Medications carousel.
* The “Due Today” window of Pillboxie shows you what meds you have scheduled for the day. Tap the “Days” button when viewing the pillboxes to schedule meds for only the weekends, etc.
* When you set a time to take a pill, Pillboxie will default to reminding you every day at that certain time. In most cases that’s not a problem, since most prescriptions require you to take daily doses anyway.
* Pillboxie will allow you to customize the sound of its push notifications, but besides that, there are no extra settings.
* If you are a looking for a way to visually manage your meds on the iPhone, Pillboxie is where it’s at. The app is available for $0.99 in the App Store.
* Pillboxie’s developer, Jared, has been nice enough to give iDB 5 free copies of Pillboxie for iPhone. If you’d like a promo code for this awesome app, leave a comment on this review to claim your copy. The first five people to comment will win.
