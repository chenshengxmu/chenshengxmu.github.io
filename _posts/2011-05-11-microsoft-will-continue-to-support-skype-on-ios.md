* You can rest easy. Microsoft’s CEO, Steve Ballmer, has confirmed that the company will “continue to invest in Skype on non-Microsoft client platforms.”
* As we previously reported, Microsoft has acquired Skype to the tune of $8.5 billion. The technology juggernaut plans on implementing Skype’s VoIP technology into its Windows Phone 7 platform, but the company also states that it will continue to support Skype on non-Windows platforms.
* Macworld,
* “Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer today promised that the company would continue to develop and support Skype on rival platforms.
* We will continue to invest in Skype on non-Microsoft client platforms,” said Ballmer during a news conference announcing the company’s plan to buy chat and Internet phone software maker Skype for $8.5 billion.”
* Skype currently has clients on 6 different mobile/desktop operating systems, so it’s relieving to hear that Microsoft has no plans to abandon support for the non-Windows clients.
* When Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype was announced, iOS and Mac users became immediately concerned that Skype’s Apple-friendly apps would be abandoned. It is important to remember that Microsoft has not neglected Apple’s platforms in the past.
* “Ballmer was adamant that the new Microsoft Skype division would not ditch owners of iPhones, Android smartphones, Macs and more.
* “A, I said it and I meant it,” said Ballmer when a reporter asked for assurances that Skype would continue to be available for operating systems and devices not sold by Microsoft. “B, we’re one of the few companies with a track record of doing this,” he added, citing Microsoft’s work on Mac OS X, where it develops and sells a Mac-specific version of its Office suite.”
* The real question to ask is this: How will Microsoft change the Skype app? Will it be renamed? Will the interface be revamped?
* Hopefully we won’t have to start saying, “Hey, get on Windows Mobile P2P Video Chat 2012 Full Suite Edition.”
