* Purported drawings of iPhone 8’s logic board showing internal component layout leaked on the web Monday. The images indicate that Apple’s upcoming flagship won’t adopt USB-C after because the good ol’ Lightning port can be seen at the bottom of the device. Other things we can infer from the images, allegedly obtained from a Foxconn source, include an L-shaped battery, a display with True Tone capability similar to that on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and more.
* The diagrams show an L-shaped two-cell battery pack (in yellow and orange) that KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo mentioned in February. Stacked logic board design should permit Apple to squeeze a Plus-sized battery inside a similarly-sized device like a 4.7-inch iPhone.
* Kuo called for a 2,700 mAh L-shaped two-cell battery pack for iPhone 8.
* Below the battery is the Taptic Engine and new components required for a thin-film 3D Touch module. The purple section is devoted to Touch ID. The Lightning port is seen at the bottom, corroborating an earlier KGI report saying iPhone 8 won’t adopt a USB-C port.
* The diagram also appears to indicate that iPhone 8 might feature two speakers at the bottom (the green part), as opposed to iPhone 7 which uses one speaker at the bottom and the earpiece at the top of the phone to create stereo sound. The device should be 7.1 mm thin like iPhone 7 and have a vertically aligned dual-camera that protrudes from the back.
* The pink section in the bottom-right corner denotes wireless charging components.

* Geskin said in another tweet that the phone’s rumored stainless steel frame could be similar in appearance to the Space Black Apple Watch models. What the diagram doesn’t tell us is the location of a Touch ID sensor and 3D cameras for augmented reality features.
* The drawings were created by hand from claimed device blueprints. Be sure to take the report with a grain of salt because, as AndroidPolice points out, this Twitter account apparently belongs to a notorious faker who “purposely tries to pass fakes for real images”.
