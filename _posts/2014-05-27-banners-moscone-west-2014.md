* Apple has begun hanging colorful banners at the Moscone Center in San Francisco ahead of WWDC. The design of the banners is consistent with other WWDC14 materials we’ve seen thus far, with one showing the Conference’s tag line: ‘Write the Code. Change the World.’
* The event is slated to kick off next Monday, and run through the week, with various developer-focused workshops and classes. And of course, Apple will be delivering its annual keynote, where executives from the company will discuss the future of the OS X and iOS platforms…
* Here are a few more images via MacStories:

* Apple has already announced much of the schedule for next week, leaving out just a handful of sessions marked as ‘secret.’ The firm is expected to unveil a redesigned version of its Mac operating system, and a familiar-looking iOS 8 with new stock applications and new features.
* The big keynote is slated to begin at 10:00am PST next Monday, and will run through noon. Earlier today, Apple announced it will be live streaming the ‘exciting’ event to iOS, Mac and PC devices, but of course you can join us here for additional announcements and commentary.
