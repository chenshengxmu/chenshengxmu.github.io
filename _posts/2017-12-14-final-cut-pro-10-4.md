* Ahead of releasing its new iMac Pro, Apple earlier this morning pushed a long-expected update to its Final Cut Pro X app on Mac App Store.
* The new version brought support for high dynamic range (HDR) video, 360-degree video creation, the ability to compress your footage using the efficient H.265 codec, support for Apple’s new HEIF media format in iOS 11 and much, much more.
* The new Final Cut Pro X was previewed in October.
* The app had two million users as of April 2017. Final Cut Pro creator Randy Ubillos quit Apple two and a half years ago after spending 20 years with the Cupertino company.
* The app ranked #10 on Upwork’s list of the top 20 fastest-growing skills.
* Here’s what’s new in this edition of Final Cut Pro:
