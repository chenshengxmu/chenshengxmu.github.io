* Apple is set to open a new brick-and-mortar outlet at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, a $4 billion train transit station in Lower Manhattan, in less than a week, on Tuesday, August 16, at 12pm ET. The firm announced that its tenth store in New York City, located at 185 Greenwich Street, is located in the lower level section of the Oculus Transportation Hub.
* “We’ve got something special in store for you,” teases a message on Apple’s website inviting customers to join the company for grand opening.
* Store hours are Mon-Fri 8am-9pm, Saturday 10am-9pm and Sunday 11am-7pm.
* About two weeks ago, Apple opened its first-ever Brooklyn store in Williamsburg.
