* Hot on the heels of last week’s JailbreakCon convention, another event is set to take place on October 11th featuring some prominent members of the jailbreaking community.
* On October 11th, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, MuscleNerd, pod2g and other well-known hackers will take part in a discussion panel at this year’s Hack in the Box conference…
* From the official HITB blog (via iClarified):
* “Some of you might remember the first HITB conference at Cititel Hotel, Kuala Lumpur back in 2003. That year HD Moore spoke about Metasploit back when it was just the Metasploit Framework. That very conference also marked the last public appearance for LSD Group aka The Hackers Who Broke Windows. Sounds like a decade ago? Well, you are right. Believe it or not, it has been TEN YEARS since our first conference and what a ride it has been – ten great years, three continents, hundreds of speakers, thousands of attendees and a lifetime of stories.”
* Perhaps most interesting (to us, at least) is that the folks behind Hack in the Box will be live-streaming an iOS panel discussion with MuscleNerd, pod2g, mdowd and planetbeing.
* For those interested, the live stream URL is http://ustream.tv/channel/hitb, and it’ll go live on Thursday, October 11th at 13:30 Malaysia Standard Time.
