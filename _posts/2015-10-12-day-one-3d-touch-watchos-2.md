* Day One by Bloom Built, my go-to journaling app for iOS and the Mac, has had an app for the Apple Watch since April 2015, but it used to be hampered by the limitations of watchOS.
* With watchOS 2, apps can now run directly on the wearable device and more independently of its connected iPhone, resulting in better responsiveness and faster execution. A brand new release of Day One now includes a native watchOS 2 app, support for 3D Touch Home screen shortcuts on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and more.
* As mentioned, you can now press firmly Day One’s icon on the Home screen to reveal the following shortcuts: New Entry, New Photo Entry and Last Photo Taken.
* On the Apple Watch side, Day One is now built on watchOS 2 technology so you should expect faster performance and better dictating experience. The design has been tweaked a little, too, so the wrist app should be easier on the eyes than before.
