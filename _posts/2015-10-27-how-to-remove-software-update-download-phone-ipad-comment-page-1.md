* I am not sure if I accidentally initiated the download or if it happened on its own, but I have the latest iOS over-the-air update stored on my device. If the storage space used isn’t anything to worry about, what bothers me the most is that my iPhone now prompts me every morning to install that update, something I do not want to do, or be reminded of at this time.
* Deleting an over-the-air update downloaded to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is an easy thing to do. If you want to regain a few MB of storage, or if like me you don’t want to be asked to install that update every day, follow these simple directions.
* Step 1: On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage.
* Step 2: Under Storage, select Manage Storage.
* Step 3: Locate the iOS software download in the list and tap on it.

* Step 4: Select Delete Update, and confirm you do want to delete it.
* Of course, deleting that software update doesn’t prevent you from downloading it again when you want to. To do so, you will have to go to Settings > General > Software Update.
