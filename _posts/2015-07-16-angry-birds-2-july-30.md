* There’s still life left in the Angry Birds franchise as developer Rovio today announced that the official sequel to the original bird-flinging game that started it all will be releasing across mobile platforms in a fortnight, on Thursday, July 30.
* A promotional artwork teases a “bigger, badder, birdier” Angry Birds than the original.
* “Back in December 2009, when we were just a small games studio, we released our 52nd game featuring colorful birds, green pigs, a slingshot and a super catchy theme tune. Fast forward to 2015 and that game, Angry Birds, has taken the world by storm,” noted Rovio.
* The forthcoming physics-based puzzler will be backed by the release of an animated feature-length Angry Birds film next summer.
* The various Angry Birds games that have been released in the past six years have amassed more than three billion downloads and given birth to multiple mashups and spin-offs, such as Bad Piggies, Angry Birds Stella, Angry Birds Star Wars, Angry Birds Transformers, Angry Birds GO!, Angry Birds Epic, to name but a few.
* Angry Birds 2, which Rovio positions as “the mother of all sequels,” will join a total of fifteen games based on the Angry Birds franchise.

* While Rovio’s been enjoying huge commercial success thanks to the Angry Birds games and licensed merchandize, the company did experience its first profit drop last year, an tell-tale sign for some gamers that Angry Birds may have run its course.
* Rovio has pledged to shed more light on Angry Birds 2 on July 28 in the run-up to its launch date. More information is available at the official Angry Birds 2 website, where you can register your interest to get notified when the game hits the App Store.
* If you’re into the franchise, select Angry Birds games are currently on sale in the App Store: Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Angry Birds Space HD for iPad, Angry Birds Star Wars HD for iPad, Angry Birds Seasons HD for iPad and Angry Birds HD for iPad.
* The aforementioned titles are available discounted for a combined three bucks versus their regular combined value of thirteen bucks.
