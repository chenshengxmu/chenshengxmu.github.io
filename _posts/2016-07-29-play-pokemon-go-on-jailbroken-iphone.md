* If you have a jailbroken iPhone, which is likely after this weekend’s release of the Pangu jailbreak for iOS 9.3.3, then you’ve probably already found that Pokémon GO can’t run on a jailbroken device. It’ll crash at startup instead.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you a workaround so you can play Pokémon GO on your jailbroken iPhone without it crashing every time it starts up.
* Update: This method no longer works as of the latest versions of Pokémon GO.
* If you want to play Pokémon GO on your newly-jailbroken iPhone, then you will need to install a patch via Cydia so that the app can’t tell you’re jailbroken.
* To do that, you’ll follow these steps:
* 1) Open Cydia from your Home screen and go to the Sources tab.

* 2) Tap on the Edit button at the top right of the app interface, and then tap on the Add button at the top left of the app interface.
* 3) Type the following URL into the source-adding prompt:
* http://cokepokes.github.io/

* 4) Once entered, tap on the Add Source button. You will see a black screen with white text; wait for it to complete, then tap on the Return to Cydia button.
* 5) Now the CokePokes repository should show up in your sources list. If it does, open the Changes tab in Cydia.
* 6) Install the Masterball jailbreak tweak that shows up in the Changes interface.
* Note: You may need to search Cydia for Masterball after adding the repository if it doesn’t appear in the Changes interface.
* And now you’re done! After you respring your device, you can try re-launching Pokémon GO on your jailbroken device, and the app should launch and perform as it normally would on a stock iOS device.
* Now that you have both a jailbreak for your iOS 9.3.3 device, and the ability to play Pokémon GO on it, you should be one happy camper.
