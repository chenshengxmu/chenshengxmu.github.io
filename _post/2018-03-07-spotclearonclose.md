* If you use Spotlight regularly, then you may be familiar with how the tool remembers your previous search query. Consequently, Spotlight users are then forced to clear the search bar before they can perform a new query.
* Albeit a small inconvenience, a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed SpotClearOnClose by iOS developer Kiran Patil can put an end to these shenanigans and save you time the next time you go to use Spotlight search.
* As the name implies, SpotClearOnClose merely forces Spotlight to clear the search bar automatically whenever you leave the interface. In turn, you won’t have to do this manually when you launch Spotlight to perform a search query the next time.
* SpotClearOnClose doesn’t come with any options to configure, but it really doesn’t need any. As a simple convenience-based tweak, you can install it if you happen to find this issue annoying and fancy putting an end to it.
* If SpotClearOnClose seems like it might be relevant to your needs, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. According to the Cydia description, the tweak only works on jailbroken iOS 11 devices, such as those pwned with CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2.
* Do you think SpotClearOnClose is an improvement to iOS’ stock Spotlight functionality? Let us know in the comments section below.
