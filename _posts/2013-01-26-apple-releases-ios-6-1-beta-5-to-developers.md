* Well, that was a bit unexpected. Apple just released iOS 6.1 beta 5 to developers. The release comes just hours before the previous beta, beta 4, was scheduled to expire.
* As we noted in a previous post, this is only the second time that Apple has released a fifth build for a non-major iOS update. Developers can head over to the development portal now to download the latest beta release.
* It’s a bit weird that Apple released the beta on a Saturday evening, but as mentioned, it’s a bit more odd that this isn’t a golden master release like we expected.
* This proves to be disappointing, because it means it pushes out the window for an iOS 6.1 jailbreak release a bit further. It’s widely expected that the team working on the iOS 6.1 and iPhone 5 untethered jailbreak won’t budge before iOS 6.1 is public.
* Still, as we always do, we plan on providing you with a tutorial that shows how to jailbreak the iOS 6.1 beta as soon as we can.
* In the meantime, let me know what you think in the comments section.
