* PP, the same team who released a previous iOS 8 jailbreak for Mac, and who was accused of taking code from TaiG, has purportedly released an iOS 8.4 jailbreak. We have been able to confirm that this jailbreak works on iOS 8.4. That said, TaIG claims that PP stole its code, but we are not able to confirm this as of yet.
*  
* Keep in mind that you may want to hold off until we hear word from community leaders like saurik. Also, Cydia Substrate and other packages may need to be updated before this is truly useful, but it looks like it’s functioning fairly well thus far.
