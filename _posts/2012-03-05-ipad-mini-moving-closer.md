* A new report from DigiTimes surfaced this morning claiming that the oft-rumored 7.85-inch iPad is moving closer to production. The site points to an article from United Evening News, a Taiwanese newspaper, which says Apple has just picked suppliers for the tablet.
* DigiTimes doesn’t have the best track record in providing accurate Apple information, but we’ve seen a number of reports over the past few months regarding a mini iPad. And these particular claims appear to have some kind of basis…
* According to the UEN, Apple has tapped Pegatron to assemble the new tablet. Typically, Apple uses Foxconn for its assembly jobs, but it has decided to go with the Taiwanese-based company for this new project. The article also names LG Display and AU Optronics as component suppliers for the smaller iPad.
* This information actually lines up pretty nicely with previous reports, including one from the credible Wall Street Journal last month, that Apple is working with these three companies to produce a new tablet.
* Believe it or not, the consensus seems to be that the sub-8-inch iPad is very real. And we could see it launch as early as this fall. The product make a bit of sense if you think about it. If Apple can keep the tablet’s price below $300, it could help fend off rising competition from Amazon and Barnes and Noble.
