* As previously announced, Nintendo’s much anticipated mobile game Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is now available for free on iPhone and iPad. This is the third mobile title that Nintendo has released after Super Mario Run and Fire Emblem Heroes.
* The mobile take on the popular Animal Crossing franchise takes players into the wilderness to craft, build and design their own campsite. It has a similar look and feel to the other games in the Animal Crossing series, though scaled back for mobile.
* Instead of being set in a large location like a big city, you’re situated in a camp ground.
* You can collect items, do tasks and complete challenges for different components—all which can be combined to craft different items, from a table to a swimming pool.
* Check out the announcement trailer for the game.
* The free-to-play game is similar to other freemium titles.
* Crafting new items takes real time to complete and you can speed that up by using premium in-game currency which can be purchased optionally for real money. Remember, you can always disable In-App Purchases to prevent young kids from racking up excessive iTunes bills.
* Grab Animal Crossing for free from App Store.
* Let us know what you think of this game down below in the comments!
