* It looks like Ming-Chi Kuo was right. The KGI Securities analyst predicted, as did a few others, that Apple would be discontinuing the iPhone 5 alongside the launch of the iPhone 5s and 5c today. And they did.
* It seems that the iPhone 5c, which starts at $99 on contract, has completely replaced the 5, and Apple will cease selling it after this month. Oddly enough, however the company is keeping the iPhone 4s around…
* The 4s will be priced similar to the way the current iPhone 4 is now: free on contract. It’s odd that Apple chose to keep a 30-pin, 3.5-inch display device around, but perhaps the margins weren’t high enough on the 5 to keep it around.

* Note that the 4S model is of the 8GB variety, which is kind of low, but the device is still a steal at $0. It has an 8MP camera, a formidable A5 processor, and will come with solid software features thanks to iOS 7—including an improved Siri.
* What do you think of Apple’s move to drop the iPhone 5 and keep the 4S around? Smart/not-so-smart?
