* In the recently-released Steve Jobs biography, Walter Isaacson notes that the late CEO wanted Apple to re-invent three markets: TV, photography, and text books. Now it looks like the company has added another industry to the list: health.
* PatentlyApple is reporting that Apple has just won a patent for a major fitness center app. Judging by the filing, the software is being built for the iPhone, and will allow users to virtually interact with their local gyms and fitness centers…

* This actually isn’t the first time we’ve seen this patent. We reported on Apple’s original filing back in April of this year.
* From the filing:
* “A method for interfacing with a fitness center, the method comprising: introducing a user to a particular fitness center via an integrated application of a portable electronic device, wherein the user is a potential new customer of the particular fitness center; after the introducing, providing incentive, via the integrated application, for the user to join the particular fitness center…
* …in-gym motivation for motivating the user to work out at the particular fitness center; and providing, via the integrated application, post-workout motivation to encourage the user to actively return to the particular fitness center, wherein at least one of the providing incentive, the providing in-gym motivation and the providing post-workout motivation comprises connecting the user, via the integrated application, with a calendar server of the particular fitness center for allowing the user to perform a scheduling function with the particular fitness center.”
* Whew, that was a mouthful. While we all know that a small percentage of Apple’s patents ever make it to the hands of consumers, patent filings have correctly predicted product releases in the past.
* A fitness center application is interesting for a couple of reasons. But perhaps the most intriguing one is that there aren’t really any other companies doing anything on a major scale in the health and fitness space. If Apple could create something compelling enough to make people want to use it, it’d be the only game in town.
* Would you use a health club companion iPhone app?
