* Loyal iDB readers need no introduction to Totallee, the California company that makes ultra thin and minimalist cases for iPhone. We’ve reviewed a few of their cases in the past, and quite frankly, despite the company sponsoring this message today, Totallee makes the only cases I use on my iPhone.
* This time, Totallee is back at it with a variation of their popular super thin plastic and thin leather cases for iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. Unlike many competing products, some of these cases are available and ready to ship within 24 hours.

* The minimalist simplicity of these cases is the reason why I keep coming back to them when I need protection for my iPhone. At only 0.02″ thin and 0.1 ounce light, either the plastic or the leather option is one of the thinnest and lightest case in the world, and just as important, they don’t add any bulk to your device.
* If you’re nitpicky like me, you’ll probably appreciate the branding-free minimalistic design. The absence of any logo helps retain the aesthetic of your iPhone.
* Rightfully so, cynical people will argue that these cases can’t protect an iPhone against a 5-foot drop. This is not the point of these cases! These are made for the minimalists at heart who want to protect their iPhones from everyday wear and tear without adding bulk.
* That said, all cases feature a raised camera ring for extra protection when your iPhone is laying flat on a table for example. Again, these are perfect cases for those looking for essential protection without compromising the thinness and — dare I say — the beauty of their devices.

* Available for the new iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, all models ship within 24 hours, which means that if you act right now, you can get your case even before your iPhone arrives.
* There are two models available in various colors:
* Both models come with a two-year warranty and are guaranteed to fit your iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR perfectly. All cases can be purchased from Totallee’s website or from Amazon.
