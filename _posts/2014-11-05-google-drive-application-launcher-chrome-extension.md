* Google on Wednesday announced a new extension for the Chrome browser which makes it easy to open files stored in your Google Drive in compatible applications on your Mac or Windows PC.
* “This includes apps like advanced image and video editing software, accounting and tax programs, or 3D animation and design tools,” wrote the search firm in a blog post.
* Simply right-click on the file from Google Drive and select “Open with” to see a list of applications on your computer that can open it. The extension is called “Application Launcher for Drive” and you can download it for free in the Chrome Web Store.
* You can choose to open a PDF file with Adobe Reader or Apple’s Preview, a .PSD with Photoshop and more. After making your edits and saving the file, any changes will sync across all your devices and other collaborators.
* And here it is in action.

* You will need Google Chrome to install this extension.
* If you don’t keep Google’s browser installed on your system, you can download Chrome at google.com/chrome. And if you want to sync your Mac with Google Drive, you’ll need to download the free Google Drive desktop client for Mac or Windows.
* You must be on the new Google Drive to use this extension. To learn more, check out Google’s Help Center.
