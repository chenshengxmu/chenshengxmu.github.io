* With increased competition in the media-fingerprinting and recommendations space and an ever-growing number of new music services vying for our attention, incumbents like Shazam are finding it harder to stay relevant.
* Shazam is of course wildly popular so it’s not really going anywhere. On the other hand, with growth slowing – they have 150 million users – the company has now decided to redesign the iPhone app in order to increase engagement.
* The app redesign signals bigger changes coming to the service later this month. Both Shazam and Shazam Encore have received this visual makeover, now live in the App Store…
* TechCrunch reports that the incoming Shazam redesign focuses on TV results, music videos and lyrics, with a lyrics preview appearing as soon as a track is matched.
* “A larger refresh of the app” is expected to roll out over the month ahead.
* Other changes include easy access to previewing, buying and sharing a track and quicker access to related videos and recommendations unique to Shazam, according to a media release sent out this morning.
* The new card-style interface can be seen on the screenshot in the upper right corner.
* As you can see, the revamped UI has a much cleaner look and bigger buttons that make it easier to preview a track on streaming services such as Rdio and Spotify, share your Shazams on social media, purchase matched songs from iTunes and more.
* I especially like how recommendations are now a tap away, another clever design choice that should boost engagement. According to Shazam, those of you in their test group are going to get a sneak peek of the new Shazam experience.
* Android users will get the new look in a few weeks’ time, Shazam said.
* Ad-supported Shazam is free in the App Store.
* To get rid of advertising and gain access to advanced features, download the $6.99 Shazam Encore from the App Store.
