* iOS’ stock email app is lacking in the user experience area, and the folks behind Sparrow have successfully capitalized on the default app’s shortcomings.
* Unfortunately, while it succeeds with flying colors in a multitude of areas where the Mail app stumbles, it’s still not quite ready for primetime due to a few essential issues.
* Check out our full video review inside…
* Sparrow was originally an app for the Mac, and I’ve used it ever since it was in beta. Once I switched to Sparrow on the Mac, I haven’t dared look at Apple’s stock mail app the same.
* Sparrow is a Gmail client that brings some of Google’s best features to a well put together application; its thoughtfulness and intuitiveness makes it my go to app for email on the desktop.
* That same usability is translated to iOS for the most part. Sparrow for the iPhone is built upon swiping navigation, and as a result there’s usually more than one way to accomplish a specific task.
* It’s extremely fast, works well with Gmail’s labels, features no-brainer setup, has built in alias support, custom signatures, and threaded message views. In many ways it’s more full-featured than Apple’s stock offering.
* Sadly, though, there’s no support for push notifications, you can’t set it up as the default mail client, and the way it handles deleting email and moving specific messages to folders is a bit on the suspect side.
* It’s these issues that prevent Sparrow from being a true Mail app replacement. Once these are ironed out — and they inevitably will be — then Sparrow hands-down succeeds the Mail app as being the go to email client of choice for the iPhone.
* If you’re interested in giving it a go for yourself, Sparrow can be had for $2.99 on the App Store.
* Have you tried out Sparrow? Do you use it on the desktop? What are your thoughts on their iOS offering thus far?
