* YouTube channel EverythingApplePro posted an interesting video this weekend, showing multiple side by side speed comparison tests of all 10 iPhone models. This includes the iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G and the original iPhone.
* The clip, which is about 4 minutes long, shows a wide range of speed tests such as shutdown, startup, webpage loading, and even a GeekBench benchmark test. For the most part everything works out like you’d expect, with the newer devices outpacing their predecessors, but there are a few surprises.
* Again, there’s nothing too crazy here, but the video does provide a unique look at how the iPhone has evolved since 2007. Apple updates the handset on an annual basis, so we obviously see the incremental improvements each year, but it’s easy to forget how far the device has come as a whole in the past 7 years.
* Apple announced the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus earlier this month, and they both officially went on sale last Friday. Apple called the two smartphones the “The Biggest advancements in iPhone history,” and they both include larger displays, thinner design, improved cameras, and of course the faster A8 processor.
