* iOS 11.1 isn’t even released publicly yet, but iOS 11.2 beta 1 has arrived for developers. There are a handful of changes and tweaks in this initial beta, but we are still missing the big features like iMessages in the cloud, AirPlay 2, and Apple Pay Cash.
* The biggest change is a new feature for Control Center.
* You can now easily view multiple sources in the Now Playing widget. For instance, you can see what is playing on your iPhone and your Apple TV. This seems almost like a precursor for AirPlay 2 which will allow you to playback your audio to multiple speakers at once. It’s actually pretty handy to be able to go in and view what each is playing, and tapping on either lets you jump between the controls.
* We went hands on with the latest beta to test out the new features, and see what’s changed.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* We also got new wallpapers that previously were exclusive to the new iPhone 8/Plus and iPhone X.
* There were several bugs fixed including a flicking boot logo and the infamous calculator bug.
* Small tweaks include SiriKit for HomePod being added, thinner load bar on boot up, adjusted some emoji, and other under-the-hood changes.
* As always let us know if we missed anything, and what you think of the changes, down below in the comments.
* Also be sure to also check out what is coming in iOS 11.1!
