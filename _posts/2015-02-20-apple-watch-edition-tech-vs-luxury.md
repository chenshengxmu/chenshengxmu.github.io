* People will get their panties in a bunch when Apple announces the Watch Edition costs several thousand dollars, but that’s mostly because these people don’t understand what Apple is doing.
* This quote from John Gruber’s post about Apple Watch pricing hits the nail on the head:
* Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so don’t try to price it like one.
* To paraphrase Gruber, the solid gold Apple Watch is not a tech product, it’s a luxury item, and it shall be priced accordingly. You can think it’s insane, but at the end of the day, it’s not any less insane than Rolex selling a gold watch for $20,000.
* For more thoughts about Apple Watch pricing, I invite you to read Gruber’s take.
