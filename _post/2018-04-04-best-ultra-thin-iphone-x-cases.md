* Looking for a minimal or ultra-thin case for your iPhone X? iDB has you covered. We’ve put together a roundup of some of our favorite cases for Apple’s flagship handset that are inexpensive, feature little-to-no branding, and are so thin you’ll forget they’re even there.
* Ultra-thin cases are great options for all of the reasons outlined above: they tend to be less expensive than larger cases, and they usually forgo large, gaudy graphics in favor of minimal, solid color designs. Plus they are almost as thin as an average glass screen protector, making them the perfect solution for folks who dislike large, bulky cases. After all the iPhone X is already a sizable device, no sense in adding extra bulk to it.
* Yes. Less protection. While all of the cases listed below cover all of the sides and back of the iPhone (sans Lightning connector and other required openings), they offer little in the way of fall protection. Don’t get me wrong, you’re still guarded from bumps, scratches and other backside damage. But if you were to drop your phone, particularly on its display, these thinner cases won’t help you much. Just think of them like a removable, reusable skin.
* And now, without further ado, our roundup of the best ultra-thin cases for your iPhone X.
