* Following The Great Flattening earlier today, Apple has added a new section to its App Store designed to highlight apps that are optimized for the iOS 7 appearance and technologies that make this OS update arguably the most important in Apple’s history.
* The all-new ‘Designed for iOS 7’ section advertises apps like Evernote, OmniFocus 2, NBC, OpenTable, Perfect Weather and other third-party software featuring the iOS 7 style design. Jump past the fold for the full breakdown…
* The section, available via this link, is now live both through the App Store in the newly updated iTunes 11.1 for Mac and Windows PCs (and older versions) and via the stock storefront app on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices.
* At post time, Apple listed a few dozen apps.
* I have a feeling there will be a ‘Designed for iPhone 5s’ section come this Friday.
* You can sort iOS 7-ready apps by Name (left), Release Date (middle) and Featured (right).

* Tapping the section takes you to a continuously updated list of third-party apps which can be sorted by name, release date and featured, the latter highlighting iOS 7-optimized apps that had been hand-picked by App Store editors.
* Cody has also published our own running list of major iOS 7 app updates.
