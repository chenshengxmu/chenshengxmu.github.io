* Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers have kicked off the recruiting process in preparation for an ‘iPhone 7’, CNBC reported Tuesday citing Economic Daily News. The mass-hirings have started earlier than usual because the iPhone 7 design is said to be “more complex than previous models,” which meant that Apple’s suppliers needed to start work on iPhone 7 parts earlier than on previous iterations.
* Both Foxconn and Pegatron had ramped up hiring as they prepared to assemble the upcoming iPhone 7 models, ahead of their expected September release.
* A job ad on Foxconn’s website urged potential workers to “hurry to apply,” warning them that the jobs hotline might be busy because “so many applicants are dialing in.”
* Foxconn is expected to assemble the new iPhones in its Zhenzhou factory in China.
* According to CNBC, the hiring at both Foxconn and Pegatron had kicked off at least a month earlier than in previous years. “It was the first time in two years that Foxconn had started recruiting on the mainland as early as May,” reads the report.
* Taiwanese trade publication, DigiTimes, corroborated the story, confirming that the new iPhones will start shipping at the end of September. DigiTimes added that the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model will be assembled by both Foxconn and Pegatron, while Foxconn and Wistron will handle the larger 5.5-inch model.
* Wistron has not assembled iPhones since the iPhone 5c.
* “Apple has been separating its component orders to multiple suppliers to lower risks,” reads the story. Apple currently has at least two suppliers for components such as batteries, hinges and chassis.
