* Apple yesterday refreshed the iPod lineup alongside the new iPhone 5 (here’s your keynote) and boy do these colorful iPod touches look sexy. The company also revamped the popular iPod nano, making it taller and giving it a widescreen display with multitouch user interface, Bluetooth (we envision interesting accessories for the new nano).
* Yes, the new touch comes in a bunch of attractive colors as well. The entry-level iPod shuffle also saw a slight redesign. But how do you go about advertising the updated iPods in a memorable, attractive and easy-going manner? Here’s how…
* The commercial cleverly combines the elongated iPod touch and iPod nano form factors with vivid color choices for each devices.
* It’s positively aggressive, fun and cheerful with the new little devices bouncing all over the place (via Michael Steeber of Cult of Mac).
* Notice how the two shuffles combine into a single iPod nano?
* The new iPod touch has the same taller but not wider four-inch Retina display like the iPhone 5. Powered by the A5 chip, it weighs in at just 88 gram and has a five-megapixel iSight camera on the back and FaceTime HD out the front. It costs $299/$399 for 32GB/64GB of storage and is available in black, white, pink, yellow and blue.

* The new iPod nano has a 2.5-inch widescreen multitouch display, has the home button, FM tuner, pedometer, Bluetooth and Ligtning dock connector. It costs $149 and is available in seven different colors: aluminum, black, purple, green, blue, yellow and red.
