* French outlet Consomac has spotted (Google Translate) several unreleased Apple devices that were recently added to the Eurasian Economic Commission’s database, where companies are required by EU law to register devices that use encryption before they’re released.
* Aside from other unreleased Apple products, two new iPads have been discovered in the database with model numbers A1954 and A1893. Apple is expected to update iPad Pro this year with new features like the TrueDepth camera, Face ID and Animoji, but it’s unclear from the filing if these model numbers belong to the refreshed iPad Pro models or updated 9.7-inch iPads and iPad mini models.
* Both A1954 and A1893 devices are listed as running iOS 11.
* The filings also mention several other iOS 11-powered Apple tablet computer samples carrying unusual model numbers, like CC1704, CC1706, CC1708, CC1703, CC1705 and CC1707, as well as samples of the Apple-branded brand smartphones with model numbers AA1710, AA1711, AA1712, AA1713 and AA1714.
* The outlet took that as proof of a major Apple media event in March, but the company could also choose to announce new products quietly via a press release. For what it’s worth, DigiTimes alleged recently that Apple would release a bunch of new products in March, including update to MacBook Pro, Apple Watch and iPad.
