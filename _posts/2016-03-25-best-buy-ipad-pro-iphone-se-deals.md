* If you’re thinking about getting an iPhone SE or Apple’s new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, you might want to check out the new promotions over at Best Buy. The electronics retailer is currently offering notable discounts and deals on both devices, as well as on the iPhone 6s and Apple Watch.
* For starters, if you purchase and activate an iPhone SE with a two-year contract and sign up for a free My Best Buy Mobile account, they’ll throw in a free $50 gift card for good measure. The offer is valid if you get the device on monthly installments, too.
* Those who are in the market for Apple’s new 9.7-inch iPad Pro can trade in their existing iPad 2 or newer model and receive a $100 gift card for the new model purchase.
* But that’s not all.
* How about a cool $300 off a Wi-Fi + Cellular edition of the new iPad Pro on a two-year Verizon plan? Or, buy any iPhone on a two-year Verizon contract and an iPad Pro and you’ll get $350 off.
* Both deals are in-store only.
* Best Buy is accepting online pre-orders for the new iPhone SE and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and also has some cool deals for customers who’d purchase an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus or Apple Watch.

* For example, you’ll receive a free Beats Pill 2.0 speaker if you buy/lease and activate a 64GB or 128GB iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus with Sprint Lease or monthly installment plan for Verizon Wireless, AT&T or Sprint.
* That particular deal is in-store only.
* As for the Apple Watch, they’ve discounted all Apple Watch models by up to $100 from their original prices before Apple slashed the lineup by $50 at the ‘Let us loop you in’ event.
* Specifically, you can get a 38mm aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a Sport band for just $249 at Best Buy ($299 for the larger 42mm model), or $449 for a 38mm stainless steel Apple Watch model with a Sport band (add an extra $50 if you’re picking up a 42mm model).

* By comparison, the 38mm aluminum Apple Watch now starts at $299 over at the Apple Store, or $349 for the 42mm model. As for the 38mm stainless steel Apple Watch, that one will now set you back $549 through Apple, or $599 for the 42mm variant.
* It’s worth mentioning that these are prices for the stainless steel model with Apple’s new Woven Nylon band while Best Buy currently offers the new band only with Apple Watch Sport models.
* On a related note, the Apple Online Store is now offering all new Apple Watch bands that were introduced at Monday’s event with an in-store pickup (select Personal Pickup at checkout).
