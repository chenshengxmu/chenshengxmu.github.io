* It didn’t take long for the iPhone Dev Team to release an updated version of RedSn0w to support backing up the precious activation tickets resulting from the SAM unlock.
* Instead of having to manually go in and backup your activation tickets, you can use a new option found in RedSn0w instead.
* The full download for RedSn0w 0.9.10b8 can be found inside, along with the tool’s release notes…

* Per the iPhone Dev Team’s blog post:
* redsn0w 0.9.10b8 adds the ability to backup arbitrary directories or files from your device into a zip file on your Mac or PC. The new button is Extras->Even More->Backup and it requires your device to be jailbroken with the afc2 service enabled (most jailbreaks include that). By default it will backup your activation records from /var/root/Library/Lockdown, which is useful for everyone taking advantage of today’s SAM unlock using Loktar_Sun’s trick (more on that in a later post!).
* So in other words, you can now backup arbitrary directories, and RedSn0w will by default backup the /var/root/Library/Lockdown which is needed to preserve your activation ticket.
* We’re anxious to see what else the Dev Team has to say about the SAM unlock. Once they chime in with a further update, we’ll be sure to divulge the details.
* You can download RedSn0w 0.9.10b8 for Windows and Mac from our downloads page. For more information on RedSn0w in general, visit our dedicated RedSn0w page.
