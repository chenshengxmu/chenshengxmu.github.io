* Facebook announced yesterday a new look for Trending results page, which is the page you see when you click on a Trending topic to learn more about it.
* “You’ve always been able to click on a topic to see related posts and stories, but we’ve redesigned the page to make it easier to discover other publications that are covering the story, as well as what your friends and public figures are saying about it,” said the company.
* Tapping a Trending topic now pulls up a carousel with stories from other publications that you can swipe through to see what other news outlets are saying about each topic. The stories that appear in this section are some of the most popular stories about that topic on Facebook.
* If you haven’t used Trending before, that’s because the feature can be quite difficult to find in Facebook’s mainland mobile app. To address that issue, Facebook will soon kick off a test in News Feed that will show people the top three Trending stories, which they can tap to reveal the full list of Trending topics and explore what others are discussing on Facebook.
* While most people will not see Trending in their News Feed, those who do can remove it easily via a popup menu to prevent Trending items from being shown to them in the future.
* You’ll be able to see the new Trending results page on iPhone in the US. They plan to make it available on Android and desktop soon.
