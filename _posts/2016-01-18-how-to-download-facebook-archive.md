* If you’re considering closing your Facebook account and leaving the service, you should store on your computer copies of the photos, videos, status updates, wall posts and other content you’ve published on Facebook thus far. Thankfully, this can be easily done by downloading your entire Facebook data as a ZIP file.
* This gives you a permanent copy of a lot of the same information available to you in your Facebook account.
* This includes stuff like your Timeline info, posts you have shared, messages, photos and more, as well as data you did not create yourself such as the ads you have clicked on, logged IP addresses and what not.
* This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of downloading an archive of your Facebook information to a computer, and exploring its contents.
* There’s no way to individually select which data you would like to download as part of your Facebook archive, so you’ll have to download the ZIP file in its entirety and explore its contents later.
* Step 1: Log in to Facebook on your computer and access Account Settings: click at the top right of any Facebook page and select Settings.
* Step 2: Click General in the lefthand column.
* Step 3: Click Download a copy of your Facebook data at the bottom of the General Account Settings page.

* Step 4: You’ll be taken to a new webpage to confirm that you really wish to download your Facebook information.

* To continue, click the blue Start My Archive button.
* Step 6: You must now verify your identity by typing your Facebook password in order to help protect the security of your account.
* Step 7: A confirmation message pops up, saying the system is gathering your information and will send a message to the email address on file as soon as your archive is ready for download.

* Click Okay to dismiss the message.
* Step 8: Now check your inbox for a message from Facebook confirming that you requested a copy of your account data. You’ll receive another message containing a download link once it’s ready, which can take up to several hours.

* Tip: If you’re not receiving emails from Facebook, check your junk folder and ensure that Facebook’s emails are not classed as spam.
* Step 9: When you receive another message containing a download link, click it to retrieve an archive of your Facebook data.

* Click the green Download Archive button to continue. You might need to enter your Facebook password to start the download.
* Step 10: Go to the Downloads folder on your computer (it’s located inside your account’s home folder) and open the ZIP archive you downloaded to unarchive it.

* To learn more about data categories available to you after downloading a Facebook archive, check out this support document.
* If you’d like to request detailed information pertaining to personal data that Facebook stores on its servers, fill out this form.
* Upon downloading and unarchiving the archive, data from your Facebook profile is available within specific folders for pictures you have shared on service, videos you uploaded to Facebook and more.
* The best starting point is the “index.htm” file, which can be opened locally in Safari or any other web browser to get to specific pieces of information more quickly.

* Upon opening “index.htm” in Safari, you’ll see a webpage with a crude representation of your profile along with the most important information from your About section and handy links in the lefthand column for quickly accessing specific data such as your friends list, messages, photos, videos, pokes and more.
* For instance, if you want to retrieve a specific picture or video you posted to Facebook, click Photos or Videos in the lefthand column and then click the media thumbnail. The photo or video will open it in its original resolution, and you can right-click to make a copy of the media file in another folder on your computer.
* You can also browse these folders directly on your computer.
