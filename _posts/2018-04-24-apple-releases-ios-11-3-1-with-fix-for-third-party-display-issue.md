* Apple on Tuesday released iOS 11.3.1. The update comes roughly 1 month after the official launch of iOS 11.3, and it can be installed by navigating to the Settings app -> General -> Software Update.
* As you can see in the screenshot above, iOS 11.3.1 improves security and addresses an issue where touch input was unresponsive on some iPhone 8 devices because they were serviced with non-genuine display replacements.
* Despite the fix, Apple warns that non-genuine replacement displays may have ‘compromised visual quality’ and may fail to work properly. The company advises users to seek Apple-certified repair experts.
