* Earlier today, TaiG released version 2.4.1 beta of its iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool on Windows. This update was aimed at fixing the frustrating 60% hangup issues that occurred during the jailbreak process.
* Well under 24 hours later, and TaiG has upgraded the beta jailbreak tool to a public version. As such, the TaiG team is recommending that all new jailbreakers use version 2.4.1 instead of previous versions.
* Here is the full change log for TaiG 2.4.1:
* As we’ve noted in our previous post, this will seemingly be the new trend for TaiG releases—a beta, followed shortly thereafter by public release.
* You can download TaiG 2.4.1 from our downloads page today.
* If you’ve been experiencing issues getting stuck at 60% during the jailbreak process, then it’s highly recommended that you give version 2.4.1 a shot. I’ve already talked with several individuals who experienced issues with previous versions of the tool, and they confirmed that they were able to successfully jailbreak with this latest version.
* What’s your experience been like with version 2.4.1? Please share your thoughts in the comments below.
