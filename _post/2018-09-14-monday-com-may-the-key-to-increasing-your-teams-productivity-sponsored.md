* There are plenty of team management tools out there, but enterprise software often has a learning curve that slows teams down rather than speeding things up. Oftentimes, assigned tasks and overall goals get divvied up among members without an accessible overview of the project as a whole, creating fractured communication and taking the “team” out of “team management.”
* monday.com is taking a totally new approach to team management.
* monday.com is a team management tool that serves as your team’s centralized hub for just about everything. It’s simple enough so as not to overwhelm you, but not so oversimplified that it lacks the features you need to foster progress. As a matter of fact, it’s the complete opposite. 

* The platform allows you to break down each project into stages or tasks, and assign a person to a corresponding task, promoting accountability within the team. Everything is highly visual so you can easily keep track of each other’s progress, but every part is easily adjustable in case things don’t turn out as planned.
* monday.com also allows teams to communicate within the platform, cutting down on the amount of laborious sifting through various email threads to figure out a workflow. Messages can be sent inside of tasks, so all the communication is contextualized before meeting resolution or seeking it.
* The platform also supports uploads, so documents and videos can be added to facilitate more collaboration, and integration with other productivity apps. So if your team is already using tools like Slack, Google Calendar, Dropbox, Microsoft Excel, Trello, and Jira, there’s specific, clean shortcuts to integrate the information from those platforms into monday.com.
* The product’s intuitive design, uniquely flexibly structure and exceptional scalability has driven widespread appeal across over 200 business verticals, from tech-savvy to non-tech savvy alike. Active paying customers include Carlsberg Group, Discovery Channel, McDonalds, and WeWork, among over 35,000 others.
