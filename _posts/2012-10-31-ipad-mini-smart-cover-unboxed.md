title: iPad mini Smart Cover unboxed
---
* There’s really not a lot to say here, because if you’ve ever used a Smart Cover before, you know exactly what to expect. With that said, there are, as we’ve previously noted, some changes with the way the hinge attaches to the iPad mini.
* The magnets are now wrapped in polyurethane and micro-fiber, presumably to prevent the Smart Cover from scratching the mini’s surface like full sized Smart Covers have been known to do. The all enclosed hinge also serves up a cleaner look when compared to its big brother.
* What do you think? Have you ordered a Smart Cover to go with your iPad mini?
