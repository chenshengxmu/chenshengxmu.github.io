* So you’ve watched Apple’s keynote, and you’ve been keeping up with the news today, but thus far you’ve only seen the new iPads and Retina iMac from either afar or in marketing materials. Obviously, the products are going to look good in photos, but what about in real life?
* Following the event today, select journalists were given the chance to go hands on with the two new iPads, and 5K iMac, and have posted videos of their initial reactions. So naturally, we’ve rounded up some of these clips that show folks trying out the devices for the first time.
* TechCrunch:
* The Verge:
* Engadget:
* Laptop Magazine:

* Obviously these are just initial impressions, gleaned from a short amount of time with each product in a very controlled environment, so opinions could change after the wow-factor wears off. It’s hard to imagine anyone ever not liking that gorgeous 5K Retina display though.
* The new iMac starts at $2,499 and is on sale now, and the new iPads begin at $399 and will be available for pre-order starting tomorrow. Apple hasn’t said, however, when the refreshed tablets will hit store shelves, but if it follows past behavior, they should launch next week.
