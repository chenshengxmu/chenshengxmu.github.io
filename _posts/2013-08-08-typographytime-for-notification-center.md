* If you’re a fan of the legendary TypographyTime lock screen add-on for LockInfo, then perhaps you’ll be interested in adding a TypographyTime clone to Notification Center? That’s the exact premise behind TypographyTime for Notification Center, a jailbreak widget that adds a stylized clock to iOS’ pull down information panel.
* We’ve taken some, ahem, time to go hands-on with the widget. Check inside for the full video walkthrough showcasing all of the pertinent details…
* To enable the widget, you’ll need to head over to the stock Settings app > Notifications > and then enable the TypographyTime widget. Once enabled, simply slide down the Notification Center panel to view the new stylized clock.
* TypographyTime for Notification Center features no options or settings to configure outside of adding it to Notification Center. It’s an extremely simple tweak, that brings time, day, and date to your Notification Center window. True, it’s a bit on the redundant side with the status bar clock and Home screen date app icon, but for those of you looking to spice things up a bit, TypographyTime is a decent choice.
* If interested, you can download TypographyTime free of charge from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Please share your thoughts and comments about the widget in the section below.
