* As you can tell, there are plenty of new settings to play with concerning iCloud.
* You can toggle iCloud syncing with everything from Mail to your bookmarks. Your iCloud storage and backup usage is always available for viewing, and you can buy more storage if you plan on exceeding the 5GB that Apple offers for free.
* The settings for Photo Stream look a lot like the current Photos app. The last screenshots show the Automatic Downloads feature of iOS 5 that works with iCloud to allow your purchased iTunes content to by synced wirelessly across all of your devices.
* If you’ve got any more iOS 5 screenshots to send us, check out our About page to get in contact. We look forward to hearing from you.
