* Apple on Thursday seeded the second beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 to developers. The software, labeled build 14F19a, is available to all registered Mac developers in the Updates section of the Mac App Store, or as a standalone download from Apple’s dev portal.
* Beta 2 of 10.10.5 comes two weeks after the first developer beta, and just a month after 10.10.4 was released to the public. It also comes on the same day as beta 2 of iOS 8.4.1, suggesting that Apple is looking to shore up its two OSes before their major fall updates.
* With that in mind, we don’t expect to see any new features in 10.10.5. Apple essentially confirms as much in the release notes, saying “the OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac.” We’ll let you know if that changes.
* Earlier this week, Apple seeded beta 5 of OS X El Capitan to developers, and a public release is expected within the next few months. That update will include a handful of user-facing features, but will also focus on reliability and other performance-related improvements.
