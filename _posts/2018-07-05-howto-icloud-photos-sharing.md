* No one likes multi-megabyte attachments, but hey, iOS 12 lets iPhone and iPad users quickly share photos, videos and other items in their Photos library by generating Dropbox-style links that anyone can access and download a slew of shared media to their device.
* HIGHLIGHTS:
* Why share links, not the actual files?
* Because sending full-resolution photos and videos via email or iMessage is so last century.
* Th ability to share media through a link solves this problem in one fell swoop. To see the shared items, the other side simply clicks a link. It’s an admittedly cool feature that works similar to sharing a file from Dropbox and should come especially in handy when sending media to non-Apple devices.
* Your device uploads the items to iCloud, but don’t worry about running out of space because this doesn’t count against your iCloud quota. You’ll save other people a bunch of bandwidth by sending media in this manner because all you’re sending is a link.
* TUTORIAL: How to easily turn an iPhone photo album into a public website
* Recipients use a share link to access your items right in their Photos app or through a desktop browser. A preview page is automatically generated at the URL and in the Photos app of everyone involved.
* The shared link is accessible to anyone that has it, for up to a month.
* This is what you’ll need to generate iCloud.com sharing links:
* People you send these links to needn’t have iCloud Photos turned on.
* Do the following to generate a sharing link to items in your Photos library:
* 1) Open the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 12 or later.
* 2) Tap Select in the upper-right corner.
* 3) Pick one or more media items you’d like to send to someone.
* 4) Tap the Share button.
* 5) Choose Copy Link in the bottom row of icons.

* Send a link to a photo instead of the actual media file
* A message says your photos and videos are being prepared for sharing, which may take a while depending on the size and the number of the shared media items.

* 6) With a link in the system clipboard, use the Paste action to send it to friends or family using Messages, Mail or another app of your choosing.
* Photos for Mac currently lacks this link-generation feature.
* You can access shared iCloud photos and videos via a web browser or through iPhone and iPad, with iOS customers treated to the most frictionless sharing experience due to the deep integration with the Photos app.

* A badged icon in the For You tab indicates new content, like shared media
* You probably won’t need to manually open a link because iOS 12’s enhanced Siri intelligence will likely detect it in Message and automatically create previews in Photos. Don’t worry, nothing will be added to your image library unless you specifically choose so.

* Pasting a link into Messages generates a rich preview of shared media
* Receiving a link in an email message on iOS may also create a preview page straight in Photos. Opening a link on a non-iOS device, like an Android smartphone or tablet, takes you to an underlying download page on iCloud.com.

* Accessing a link in your favorite desktop browser opens a nicely designed download page on iCloud.com with the same preview complete with a grid of thumbnails like in Photos.

* The media is shared with full EXIF data, including camera model and location. The link may include the sender’s name, title, the neighborhood where the images were shot and so forth.
* TUTORIAL: How to browse the Photos media library on your Mac with the Finder
* Keep that in mind if you care about online privacy before iOS 12 is widely available. The commercial edition of iOS 12 will remove location data and other personally identifiable pieces of information from the shared items.
* To retain the items before a link expires or the sender stops sharing, add them to your library in Photos or download them to a computer via the web interface. Again, nothing will be added to your Photos library unless you specifically cherry-pick a selection of the shared photos and videos that you’d like to keep.
* You can copy everything at once to Photos, pick multiple media items to keep or add a single item to your library. No matter what you choose to keep, a preview page remains present in Photos and at the share URL on iCloud until someone revokes sharing.
* As a refresher, iCloud.com sharing links automatically expire 30 days after being created.
* To add everything shared via a link, do the following:
* 1) Open the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 12 or later.
* 2) Tap the icon labeled For You in the tab area found alongside the bottom.
* 3) Tap a preview of the share underneath the Recently Shared headline.

* 4) Tap the Add All button.
* All of the shared media items get downloaded to your device in their original resolution. Find them in the Photos tab, positioned according to their original creation date.
* Do the following if you’d like to quickly add a single shared item to your library.
* 1) Open the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 12 or later.
* 2) Tap the icon For You in the tab area found alongside the bottom.

* The web interface at iCloud.com allows anyone to access shared media via a browser, even if they’re not on one of Apple’s platforms, like Linux customers.
* iCloud Photos must be on before you are permitted to create a link.
* If you try to share media but iCloud Photos is off, you’ll see a message cautioning you that iOS 12’s new sharing suggestions and iCloud.com sharing links sharing require that iCloud Photos be toggled on in the sender’s Settings app.
