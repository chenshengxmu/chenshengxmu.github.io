* Last fall, Adobe announced that it was going to be discontinuing its work on mobile Flash. The announcement essentially reaffirmed Apple’s, and more specifically Steve Jobs’, stance on the tech.
* But in case that wasn’t clear enough, the developer has just given a deadline for the cease and desist. As of August 15th, Flash will no longer be installable from Android’s Google Play Store…
* From Adobe’s blog:
*  “Beginning August 15th we will use the configuration settings in the Google Play Store to limit continued access to Flash Player updates to only those devices that have Flash Player already installed. Devices that do not have Flash Player already installed are increasingly likely to be incompatible with Flash Player and will no longer be able to install it from the Google Play Store after August 15th.”
* Not only will users not be able to install Flash on their Android devices after August 15th, but Adobe made it clear that Android 4.1 devices would not be getting the software — so keep that in mind if you’re looking at Google’s new Nexus 7 tablet.
* Android was the last major mobile platform to offer Flash, and manufacturers frequently touted that fact as an advantage over iOS devices. It looks they’ll have to figure out something else to talk about come August.
* Now, can we all agree that it’s time to stop putting ‘Lacks Adobe Flash’ in the Cons column on iOS product reviews?
