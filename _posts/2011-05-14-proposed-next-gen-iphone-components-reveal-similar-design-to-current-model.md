* We’ve said it before. With so little known about the unreleased iPhone this year, expect to see non-stop speculation regarding Apple’s next smartphone. While last year, we knew almost everything about the device, we’re not even totally positive there is going to be one this year.
* The latest bit of gossip comes from ModMyi, who have posted a photograph of an iPhone 5 component. The snapshot comes from an Italian blog which, thanks to Google Translate, claims they have actual photos of parts used in the next iPhone…
* iPhone Italia is reporting that they have received the first photographs of actual iPhone 5 components. You obviously can’t tell from the blurry pics but if these are the real deal, they tell quite an interesting story.
* There have been conflicting rumors on what the next iPhone looks like, or will even be called. While some depict the next iPhone as a complete departure from its current form as the iPhone 5, other rumors point to a more modest upgrade as the iPhone 4S.
* These supposed next-gen iPhone parts seem to point to the latter. The speaker appears to be mono like its predecessor and the home button seems to be present and not capacitive.

* Obviously this is all speculation until Apple reveals the next version of its popular smartphone. This does however, add to the building evidence that the next iPhone won’t look a lot different from the current version.
* What do you think? Are you hoping for a complete redesign?
