* You were barely able to pre-order  your new iPhone 6 Friday morning, but don’t stop that from entering our iPhone 6 case giveaway, brought to you by the fine folks over at Spigen. Unlike Apple and the carriers, iDB’s servers will most definitely be able to handle the traffic of this special giveaway, so if you have a couple minutes to spare, and want a chance to win a case for your yet-to-be-delivered iPhone 6, you’ve come to the right place.
* Spigen sent us a wide assortment of cases for iPhone 6 4.7-inch (sorry, no case for iPhone Plus), all coming in different colors. I won’t be able to list all the colors, but I will list the different styles here for you. When filling out the form below, let us know which style you’d rather receive, but please note that we might not be able to accommodate your request.
* All you have to do is like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, and retweet a simple message. All this can be done via the form below.
* a Rafflecopter giveaway
* Anyone of any age residing in the United States can enter this giveaway (sorry, shipping internationally is too time consuming). This giveaway will close on Friday, September 19th at 12 am PT. We’ll then select a winner and contact him with further instructions to receive the case. To our international readers, don’t worry, we have plenty more giveaways coming!
* The winners have been announced. You can see their names in the little widget above. Winners have been contacted with further details. They have 10 days to claim their prices, after which, the prizes will be forfeited and another winner will be picked.
