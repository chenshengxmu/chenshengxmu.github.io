* Apple on Monday released the fifth OS X El Capitan beta to developers. The new build is available to registered developers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store or through Apple’s Developer Center.
* Today’s update comes less than a week after Apple pushed out the fourth beta of OS X El Capitan, and nearly two months after its initial release in early June during Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference.
* With El Capitan, Apple chose to forgo adding a bunch of new features in favor of performance and stability improvements. There are a few changes, though, such as a revamped Mission Control with Split Screen.
* We’re installing today’s beta now, and will report back with any major changes. While the release is for developers only, Apple did rollout a public version of OS X El Capitan this month if you want to check it out.
