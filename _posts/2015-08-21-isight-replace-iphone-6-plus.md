* Apple on Friday launched the iSight Camera Replacement Program for iPhone 6 Plus. In a support document, first spotted by MacRumors, the company says it has discovered that, in some devices, the iSight camera has a component that may fail, causing your photos to look blurry.
* The program only applies to the iPhone 6 Plus, and Apple says that a very small percentage of devices has been affected. But if your 6 Plus is producing blurry photos, and has an eligible serial number, the company is offering to replace your handset’s rear-facing camera free of charge.
* Those interested in the program can visit the support page here, and enter in your handset’s serial number. If it falls in the determined range, you can choose to have your iSight camera replaced via your local Apple Store, Apple technical support, or an Authorized Service Provider.
* Apple warns that your 6 Plus must be in working order to take advantage of the free replacement, and if the device has any damage, such as a cracked screen, it will need to be fixed prior to service. The program will cover affected 6 Plus units for 3 years after the original retail sale.
