* The jailbreak scene has really been running dry lately with the lack of any new jailbreak for Apple’s latest iOS releases. Nevertheless, Cydia is still alive with a few releases that we cover throughout the week.
* In this post, we’ll show you everything that was released in Cydia this week, starting with our favorites. Then, we’ll show you all of the rest of them.

* One of the problems iPhone users have, especially when using an older iPhone that no longer has service or a SIM card, are those pesky No SIM Card Installed alerts.
* These messages never seem to go away because your iPhone is always hungry for a SIM card. CoySIM is a jailbreak tweak that tricks your iPhone into thinking a SIM card is inserted into the SIM card tray so that you can get rid of those annoying alerts.
* Moreover, it also replaces the No SIM text in the Status Bar with No Service, which is a little easier on the eyes since you’re not looking at straight up capital letters.
* For more information about CoySIM, you can read our full review.
