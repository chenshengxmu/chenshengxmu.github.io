* As was rumored yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook during his India trip announced an accelerator program for iOS developers. The facility is expected to open in early 2017.
* According to a press release issued yesterday, the iOS app design and development accelerator will open in Bengaluru, the home of India’s startup scene.
* The initiative will support engineering talent and accelerate growth in the populous country’s iOS developer community, which counts tens of thousands of programmers that write iPhone and iPad apps.
* “India is home to one of the most vibrant and entrepreneurial iOS development communities in the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.
* “With the opening of this new facility in Bengaluru, we’re giving developers access to tools which will help them create innovative apps for customers around the world.”
* Apple’s team will instruct developers on best practices regarding iOS development, helping them hone their skills and transform the design, quality and performance of their apps on the iOS platform.
* Weekly briefings will provide one-on-one app reviews for developers, support and guidance on Apple’s Swift programming language and more. According to developer placement firm Toptal, jobs requesting Swift rose 600 percent in 2015.
