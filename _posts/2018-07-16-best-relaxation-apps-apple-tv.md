* Calm is a wonderful relaxation app that offers both sounds and scenes. Choose from options like a mountain lake, sunset beach, or a mystic fountain. The scenes are not stills but moving photos that go nicely with the sounds. Plus, you can put the scene into full-screen mode.
* For an app with many sounds and scenes and bonus features to cover all types of relaxation options, Calm is a great choice.

* Atmo is another great app with beautiful scenery. You can choose from a crackling fireplace, soothing river morning, or colorful aquarium for free.
* Atmo does not have a ton of extra features as you can see. But, the app doesn’t need them. It’s a simple tool to help you unwind with gorgeous scenes and sounds that match.
