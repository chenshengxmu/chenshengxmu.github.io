* In case you haven’t seen it yet, iOS 11 comes with a redesigned Now Playing Lock screen interface. It’s sleeker and takes up less space so you can manage your music playback and see missed notifications in the same place more easily.
* Now, a new jailbreak tweak called Lysithea X by iOS developer ijapija00 brings this iOS 11 Now Playing Lock screen interface to jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Shown above, the changes are somewhat drastic. The interface for your music looks a lot like a Today widget would, only it’s showing your Now Playing media instead of your typical widget information. You get controls for music scrubbing, volume level, next and previous tracks, and playing or pausing the music.
* You can also double-tap on the album artwork to shrink the size of the widget vertically, like so:

* Lysithea X adds a preferences pane to the settings app where you can configure a few options. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to learn there are theming options available:

* Among the things you can customize are:
* These options take effect on the fly, so you don’t need to respring to save any changes.
* Lysithea X is a decent recreation of the iOS 11 Now Playing Lock screen interface experience, so if you’re interested in giving it a try, you can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* If you’re looking for even more iOS 11 features for your jailbroken device, then you might consider waiting for Eleven, which is an extensive set of jailbreak tweaks under development right now. This set of tweaks will also include an iOS 11-styled Now Playing Lock screen interface mod, but it won’t have all the theming options Lysithea X has, which is something to keep in mind.
* Do you like the iOS 11-style Lock screen media controls interface more-so than those on iOS 10? Share why or why not in the comments section below!
