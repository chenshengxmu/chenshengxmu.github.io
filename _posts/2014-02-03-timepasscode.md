* TimePasscode is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you use your device’s current time as a passcode to unlock your device. Spurred on by a Reddit request, developer Steve Hetelekides has created a tweak that allows you to have a different passcode with every passing minute.
* If you’re looking for a way to spice things up on the Lock screen from a security standpoint, then this might be the tweak for you. Have a look inside as we demonstrate how TimePasscode works on video.
* Once you install TimePasscode, venture into the stock Settings app in order to find the tweak’s preferences. Inside of TimePasscodes’s preferences, you’ll find three toggles: a kill switch, a toggle to allow the regular user-set passcode, and reverse time passcode. Each of the toggle settings can be turned off and turned on without needing a respring.
* To use TimePasscode, enabled the tweak and head to the Lock screen. Once there, you may enter the normal passcode that you established in your device’s security settings, or you may use the time passcode. The time passcode is the current time on your device. For example, if it’s 10:20, then your four digit passcode will be 1-0-2-0. If it’s 9:30, then your four digit passcode will be 0-9-3-0.

* If you have the reverse toggle enabled, then at 10:20, you will need to enter 0-2-0-1 to unlock your device instead of 1-0-2-0. You also have the option of completely disabling the normal user-set passcode, opting to use the time based passcodes exclusively.
* During my testing, I was impressed with how accurately TimePasscode worked. Steve Hetelekides did a find job fulfilling this Reddit request, and I highly recommend that you check out the tweak, which is available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Of course, TimePasscode isn’t the type of tweak that you’d download in order to lock down your device from a security standpoint, but it’s one of the better novelty jailbreak tweaks that I’ve seen on the Cydia store. What do you think?
