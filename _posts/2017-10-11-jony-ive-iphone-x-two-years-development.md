* Apple spent more than two years developing its upcoming iPhone X flagship, the company’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said in a brief interview with Japanese design magazine Casa Brutus published Tuesday.
* First spotted by AppleInsider, the interview reveals that sophisticated features like Apple’s new depth-based facial recognition system dubbed Face ID and the TrueDepth camera have made iPhone X one of the most difficult projects the company has undertaken.
* iPhone X represents a new chapter in the rich history of iPhone, Ive said. The debut of the OLED device on the tenth anniversary of iPhone was a “wonderful coincidence,” he added.
* Ive went on to explain that Face ID is the culmination of years of work towards a user interface that doesn’t require physical interaction, saying the system enables a heightened user experience versus Touch ID.
* The designer hinted they’re already working to perfect the iPhone X’s integrated chassis and display as this will obviously become Apple’s default handset design going forward.
