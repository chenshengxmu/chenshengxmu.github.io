* Apple TV is expected to gain support for Dolby Atmos as early as next month in the upcoming tvOS 12 update. As this release gets closer, Apple is beginning to add Dolby Atmos support for iTunes Movies for beta testers to enjoy. 
* As 9to5Mac has noted, Dolby Atmos titles on iTunes now include “Baby Driver,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “Deadpool 2,” “Justice League,” “Peter Rabbit,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Suicide Squad,” and more. Additionally, tvOS 12 beta testers can now do a quick Siri search for “Show me movies with Dolby Atmos,” and it responds with a listing of movies that “will sound great in Dolby Atmos.”
* Last fall, Apple introduced 4K support on the fourth-generation Apple TV. When it did, it automatically upgraded iTunes titles that were previously purchased to this display resolution. The same strategy is expected to occur later this year with Dolby Atmos when tvOS 12 arrives for the public. When this happens, Apple Music will become the first streaming box to support both Dolby Vision high dynamic range picture quality and Dolby Atmos immersive sound.
* First announced in June, tvOS 12 will arrive this fall alongside iOS 12, macOS Mojave, and watchOS 5. In addition to adding Dolby Atmos support, the update includes new screensavers and more.
