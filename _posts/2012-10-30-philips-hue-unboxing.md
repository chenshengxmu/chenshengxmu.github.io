* I know, I’m crazy like that, but I just couldn’t pass up the chance to try something this cool. I bought a Philips Hue Starter Kit for $199.95. That’s more than half the price of an iPad mini for a few lightbulbs. But these aren’t any ordinary lightbulbs, as you read in our post yesterday.
* The Philips Hue starter kit allows you to dynamically change the colors and lighting of a room using a handy iOS app. You can even turn on your lights while away from home all from your iPhone. Needless to say, my curiosity got the best of me, and I simply couldn’t resist the chance to try something like that out. Check out my unboxing inside, and stay tuned for the full review…
* Again, the hue Starter Kit is very pricey at $199.95, but with it you get three bulbs that last 15 years, the bridge that hooks up to your wireless router, and the necessary cables to power and network everything. The Hue iOS app, of course, is free of charge.
* What do you think? Am I just crazy like that?
