* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s leading independent semiconductor foundry, has landed a contract to fabricate Apple’s upcoming A8X mobile processor, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported Wednesday.
* The chip, which leaked on claimed photographs earlier this week, is said to feature faster graphics.
* In addition to an improved GPU, it reportedly incorporates twice as much RAM as its A8 counterpart, which powers the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. As such, the A8X should power Apple’s rumored ‘iPad Pro’ tablet with an ultra high-resolution 12.9-inch screen.
* Citing sources familiar with the situation, DigiTimes said an iPad powered by the A8X is expected to be released in early 2015. The chip should be manufactured on TSMC’s 20-nanometer process technology, just like its A8 counterpart.
* However, due to the A8X’s larger size yield rates may be low, meaning the iPad Pro availability could be severely limited at launch.
* TSMC (along with Samsung) is currently churning out A8 chips for the new iPhones. Interestingly enough, DigiTimes notes that TSMC is building a bunch of peripheral chips for the new iPhones, including Dialog’s power management ICs, Qualcomm’s 4G baseband chips, Synaptics’ LCD driver ICs, InvenSense’s six-axis gyroscopes and AhthenTec’s fingerprint sensors.

* Apple is holding a media event this Thursday, with pundits and reliable analysts alike expecting introductions of the second-generation iPad Air and an improved iPad mini with Retina display, but not the elusive iPad Pro.
