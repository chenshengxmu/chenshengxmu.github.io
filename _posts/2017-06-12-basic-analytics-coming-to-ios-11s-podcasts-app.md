* Like many stock apps in iOS 11, Apple’s Podcasts app has been redesigned around an Apple Music-style appearance with consolidated tabs, bigger thumbnails and more.
* As reported by Recode’s Peter Kafka and Six Colors’ Jason Snell, Apple is also making some notable changes to the way podcast feed works so that both podcast creators and advertisers can see what listeners actually like.
* As for users, they’ll be able to download full seasons of their favorite podcast shows and the Podcasts app will determine if a podcast should be played in chronological order.
* There are other updates focused on making podcast creators’ lives easier as well. According to Apple’s own spec sheet regarding the Podcasts app updates in iOS 11, the updated Apple Podcasts specification now provides the following features:
* Podcasts will be able to define individual seasons and explain whether an episode is a teaser, a full episode or bonus content. Snell explains that these extensions will be read by the Podcasts app and used to present a podcast in a richer way than the current linear approach in iOS 10.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* As explained, Apple is going to share more data with podcast creators and advertisers.
* With basic analytics, podcast creators will have the ability to see when listeners play individual episodes, what part of individual episodes they listen to, which parts they skip over and when they stop listening. To protect your privacy and prevent targeted advertising, Apple will provide aggregated, anonymized performance data that cannot be tracked to individual users.
* Currently, podcast creators can see when someone has downloaded an individual episode, but that’s about it when it comes to analytics.
* How do you like these changes coming to the Podcasts app?
