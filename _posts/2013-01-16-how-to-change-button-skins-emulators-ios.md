* In the comments section of our article on Snes9x EX+’s release, one of our readers asked if there was a way to swap out the overlays for the on-screen buttons. I thought the question was interesting enough to answer in a full tutorial.
* While there isn’t a built-in option for skinning Snes9x EX+, nor are there any themes for the app currently available on Cydia, with a jailbroken iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, it’s not too difficult to manually edit raster graphics used in any app. All you need to do is navigate to Snex9x EX+’s app directory and edit the overlay bitmap…

* Step 1: Access your iOS device’s filesystem from a computer. I’m using iTools, but you can also another iPhone file browser or use any FTP client.
* Step 2: Navigate to /Applications for system apps and open /Snes9xEXPlus.app.
* Step 3: Copy the bitmap you want to edit to your PC. For this guide we’re going to use overlays128.png.
* Step 4: Make a duplicate of the file, in case you ever want to change it back.

* Step 5: Edit overlays128.png to your liking. I’m not a skilled graphic designer, so I’m just going to tint the overlay green. You can change the overlay however you want, so long as you use the original file as a template for the size and spacing.
* Step 6: Copy the bitmap back to the Snes9xEXPlus.app folder and replace the original file.
* Step 7: Launch Snes9X EX+ and enjoy your custom control overlay.
* This guide should also work with Robert Broglia’s other emulators, such as GBA.emu. Just navigate to the appropriate app folder.
* If you have any questions or suggestions for other guides, share your thoughts in the comments below.
