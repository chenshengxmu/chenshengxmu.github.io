* In a recent study by PC Mag, AT&T’s LTE network was found to be the fastest among the top 4 carriers. But Verizon was found to be the most reliable. That’s because Big Red has 4G coverage in nearly 200 more markets than AT&T does.
* But it’s working hard to change that. This morning, the nation’s second largest wireless provider posted a number of press releases announcing that it has rolled out LTE to new markets, and expanded coverage in several existing markets…
* As for the new markets, AT&T has activated LTE in the following areas:
* And as for the expanded areas:
* AT&T says that its LTE network is now live in nearly 300 markets, and over 90% of its mobile data traffic now runs over enhanced backhaul that supports both HSPA+ and 4G LTE. And it expects to cover 300 million people with LTE by 2014.
* LTE coverage is becoming increasingly important for users, as more and more mobile devices take advantage of the technology. Verizon has a commanding lead in this space, AT&T is in second, and both Sprint and T-Mobile are way behind.
