* It filed one such dispute claim over the iPhone5.com domain (and won) and also forced a guy in Poland to relinquish ownership of aplestore.com and a bunch of other misspelled domain names.
* Also interesting, Cupertino applied for the .apple top-level domain with
* So, what’s in a name?
* A lot, obviously.
