* WeeRoll is an unreleased jailbreak tweak that lends the ability to add over a dozen animations to iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* It’s very similar to the Flowtation tweak we covered a while back, except that there’s a lot more animation options bundled with WeeRoll.
* I asked the developer why his tweak had so many animations, and he replied: “That’s just how WeeRoll”. Okay, I admit that was bad, really bad.
* To make up for it, enjoy this special video preview of WeeRoll in action…
* As of now, WeeRoll features the following animations:
* Since the tweak has yet to be released, some of its features are of course subject to change, but I think this gives you a good indication of what to expect “out of the box” so to speak.
* WeeRoll should be available soon on Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $0.99. Until then, check out our walkthrough of Flowtation if you enjoyed what you saw with WeeRoll.
* What do you think?
