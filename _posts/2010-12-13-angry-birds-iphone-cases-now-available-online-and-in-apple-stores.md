* It’s no secret that we here at iDB love Angry Birds. One of the most universally recognized games in the App Store, Angry Birds has made quite the name for itself with press and merchandise. You can already get your very own Angry Birds plush toy, and now you can have an Angry Birds iPhone case.
* About a month ago, we reported on the rumor that Angry Birds iPhone cases were only in development for a UK carrier. This does not seem to be the case, as official Angry Birds cases have been made available for purchase by Gear4 in partnership with the makers of Angry Birds…
* There are three different cases available for the iPhone 4; a red one with the classic bird, a yellow one with the specialized yellow bird, and a green one with a king pig on it.
* You can now order your own Angry Birds case online right now at the Gear4 website for $24.95 each. There have been reports that these cases have started surfacing at Apple Stores all around the world, so you may be able to just walk into your local Apple Store and pick one of these cases up.
* I personally think these cases look a little childish. I’m also skeptical of their build quality and if they actually make good cases for the iPhone 4.
* Do these cases interest you? Will you be buying one? If you get to try one out, let us know what you think.
