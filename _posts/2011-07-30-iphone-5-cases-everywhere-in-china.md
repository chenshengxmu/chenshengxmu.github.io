* Yet again, we bring you news of iPhone 5 cases. According to MIC Gadget, iPhone 5 cases are “now everywhere” in China. The site has another gallery of the new designs, and these appear to be no different than any of the other cases we have showed you.
* Chinese manufacturers appear to be confident that this is the design for the iPhone 5, as they have started mass producing them already. There is a huge incentive for these companies to have cases ready when the product comes out…
* In fact, three people were sentenced to prison in china for leaking iPad 2 case designs before its launch. These leaks have turned out to be surprisingly accurate. The iPhone 3G as well as 5th and 6th generation iPod Nano cases turned out to be real.
* As we approach the upcoming launch date, it seems that we have a pretty good idea of the iPhone 5 design.
* What do you think?
