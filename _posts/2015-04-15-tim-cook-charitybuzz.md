* For the third year in a row, Apple CEO Tim Cook is participating in a charity auction organized by the fundraising service CharityBuzz. You can now bid on the opportunity to have lunch with Cook on the Apple campus in Cupertino, California, and to be his guest at an Apple keynote event. In fact, the highest bidder will win not one but two VIP passes to an Apple keynote.
* Similar to previous auctions, this years auction is valued at $100,000 with bidding starting at $10,000. The auction launched this morning at 9am with already $25,000 in bids.
* Cook, who was recently ranked #1 on Fortune magazine’s 2015 list of the World’s Greatest Leaders, and in 2014 was named Person of the Year by the Financial Times, participated in the previous two annual events organized by CharityBuzz.
* Back in 2013, the Apple CEO helped raise a cool $610,000 while in 2012 the fundraiser brought in an impressive $310,000 for Cook’s charity pick, the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights campaign.
* Unlike his predecessor who stayed away from corporate charity donations, one of the first moves Cook made after being named CEO was starting a program at Apple to match employee donations. He is also encouraging co-workers to give to charitable organizations in their community.
* Other Apple executives like Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, and Beats Music’s Ian Rogers, have participated in charity fundraisers through CharityBuzz.
* The bidding began today and will last through May 6, after which the winners will be announced. Winning bidder and guests will be subject to security screening.
* VIP passes to an Apple event are valid for two people. The experience will be approximately one hour. As for lunch with Cook, to be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon date, cost of the meal is included in the prize, which can’t be resold or re-auctioned.
* Travel and accommodations are not included.
