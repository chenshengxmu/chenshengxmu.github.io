* Google’s Chrome has beaten Microsoft’s market-leading Internet Explorer to become the world’s leading web browser, according to research firm StatCounter.
* Chrome has been on the rise since its September 2, 2008 release, steadily chipping away market share from Microsoft’s product which has been losing ground for years now.
* For the week ended May 13, 2012, Google’s product has managed to match Internet Explorer on a global scale for the first time…
* A week later, Chrome climbed to a 32.66 percent web usage share while Internet Explorer nosedived to a 30.44 percent share. Firefox marginally improved its #3 ranking and currently has 25.8 percent share.
* Here is a snapshot of browser usage stats by StatCounter.

* As you can see, Apple’s Safari has seen a spike in usage recently, grabbing an 8.33 percent web usage share between May 21-27.
* Chrome owes its lead to strong gains in India, Europe and South America. Internet Explorer is still #1 elsewhere, including Japan, China and the United States, where Microsoft’s browser enjoys a 37 percent share versus 26 percent for Chrome.
* Last year Chrome beat out Internet Explorer, becoming the world’s top browser for a day. It’s been chasing Microsoft’s browser ever since.
* Macquarie analyst Ben Schacter thinks Google is working with Apple to bring Chrome to iOS devices. If true, Chrome for iOS should help Google own virtually all the searches.
* A beta version of Chrome hit Android devices running Ice Cream Sandwich in February.
* Whichever way you look at it, Chrome beating out Microsoft’s darling is a pretty major accomplishment – in just three years.
* And if Chrome comes to iOS, I have no doubt in my mind that its market-leading status will include mobile.
* Would you prefer Chrome for iOS over Apple’s stock Safari browser?
