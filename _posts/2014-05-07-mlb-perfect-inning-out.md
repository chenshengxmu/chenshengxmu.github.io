* Baseball fans looking for a good sim on iOS will be happy to hear that one just landed in the App Store. It’s called ‘MLB Perfect Inning,’ by Gamevil, and it’s a console-quality simulator that’s been fully-licensed by Major League Baseball.

* From the App Store description:
* The developers of MLB Perfect Inning have proudly designed their player models by mirroring their real life counterparts as accurately as possible. A resulting 215 MLB Player Modeling System along with detailed 150 MLB Player motion capturing of 75 pitchers and 75 batters raise the standard of authenticity. 
* And some of the game’s top features:
* And here’s your gameplay video:
* In my brief time with the game, I found it to be very impressive. It has a number of features, and the graphics are very sharp and life-like. The controls, though, will take some getting used to, and the menu system could be more intuitive.
* Overall I think this is a solid title, worth checking out if you’re a baseball fan. You can find MLB Perfect Inning in the App Store, for both iPhone and iPad, for free. There are some IAPs, but I didn’t notice them much in initial gameplay.
