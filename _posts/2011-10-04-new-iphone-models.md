* Things are just getting wrapped up at Apple’s iPhone event. After giving the audience a rundown of its new flagship handset, the iPhone 4S, Phil Schiller (Apple’s senior vice president of marketing) started naming off prices.
* The new iPhone will remain the same price as previous models. The iPhone 4S starts at $199 for the 16GB, and you’ll put down another $100 for the 32GB. And both models are available (of course) in black and white. But that’s not all…
* The rumors are true, Apple unveiled a third iPhone model — the 64GB, but it’ll cost you. The top-of-the-line iPhone 4S costs a cool $399, which is just $100 less than an iPad 2. But the iPhone 4S won’t be the only smartphone in Apple’s lineup.
* The Cupertino company is keeping its two previous iPhone models around, offering the 8GB 3GS for free, and an 8GB iPhone 4 for $99. As usual, all pricing above is with a two-year contract with your carrier. Talk about covering all the bases.
