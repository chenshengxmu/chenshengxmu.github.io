* After weeks of expectation, we can finally tell you for sure when the GreenPois0n jailbreak for iPhone will be released. According to P0sixninja, the new jailbreak tool will be released on Sunday, October 10 at 10.10 am GMT.
* This is some good news for those of you who’ve been on 4.1 for a while. At this time, there is no indication if GreenPois0n will be the actual name of the tool. There is also no indication whether or not it will be tethered and for what device and iOS version it will work…

* Chpwn calmed everyone down by saying this was just an ETA, and by nature, it is just an estimate. At any rates, this is very exciting.
* There is still no information about an unlock at the time being, though I’m sure the Dev Team is actively working on it.
* [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
