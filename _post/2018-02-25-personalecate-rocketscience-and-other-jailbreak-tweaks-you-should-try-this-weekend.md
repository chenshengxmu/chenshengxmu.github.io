* It shouldn’t be too much longer before the public gets a proper jailbreak on iOS 11, but in the meantime, developers continue to release jailbreak tweaks for iOS 10 devices that have been pwned with Yalu or G0blin.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the new tweaks released throughout the past week. As always, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorites and wrap things up by outlining the rest afterward.

* PersonalEcate is a fun and quirky release that lets you customize the charging text from your iPhone’s Lock screen.
* You can replace the text string with anything you want, including Emojis. The most obvious reasons to use this tweak is to apply funny messages that add character to your device.
* You can learn more about PersonalEcate and how to use it in our full review post.

* RocketScience is a tiny tweak for iOS, but after using it for about a week, I’ve learned just how necessary it is for consistency.
* The tweak adds both an icon and label above the App Switcher’s Home Screen card so it matches the aesthetic of all recently-used apps that you would typically swipe through.
* We know, first world problems, but seriously… give it a try.
* You can read our full review of RocketScience to learn more about why it’s a great tweak for jailbroken devices.

* SB3DTouchColor is a simple tweak that colorizes your Quick Action menus to match the dominant color of their respective app.
* Anyone who uses these menus frequently to access app shortcuts will enjoy the extra splash of color that the tweak has to offer. Even if you don’t like having the automatic color picker enabled, you can configure a static color option of your own that appears for every app.
* You can learn more about SB3DTouchColor in our full review.
* BatteryLifeFullScreen: Makes the Battery Life application into a full-screen app (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* HideCydiaPackages: Hides all of your installed packages in the Cydia app (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* SwipeUpAndDown: Brings new swipe gesture options to the App Switcher (free via BigBoss repository)

* Many developers are prepping their tweaks for iOS 11 considering the state of the Electra jailbreak for iOS 11.0-11.1.2. Furthermore, Saurik is working on an official update for Cydia and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11 that should help tie everything together when the time comes.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks to try, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special.
