* NCFold is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows users to group together sections of Notification Center into a folder-like structure. The purpose of the tweak, as stated in its Cydia description, is to make Notification Center more simple and efficient.
* For the most part, the Cydia description rings true. NCFold does allow for a simplified Notification Center view, yet you can easily expand the folded sections that it creates with just a tap. Check out our walkthrough of NCFold after the break.
* As you can see from our video walkthrough, grouped sections aren’t just limited to incoming notifications, but they work with the content found on Notification Center’s Today View as well. Tapping a section allows you to toggle between folded mode and expanded mode.
* After installing NCFold, you’ll need to venture to the Settings app to enable the tweak; it is disabled by default after installation. In NCFold’s preferences, you’ll find a few toggles geared towards altering the look of the folders found in Notification Center.

* Users can choose to enable a split line feature to further define the Notification Center’s folded areas, and a message number toggle to show a running count of all messages appearing within a folder. There’s also a multi-line message preview option, and a toggle to enable unlimited recent items.
* Users are not required to initiate a respring in order to make any of the preference changes take effect. Simply toggle the desired feature, and the changes will happen on the fly.
* NCFold is available for purchase on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.00. Would you consider using it? Let me know what you think down below in the comments section.
