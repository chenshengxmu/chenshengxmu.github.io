* About 4 months ago, Apple made the headlines for surpassing Microsoft in terms of market value. Today, Apple is making the headlines again, this time for becoming the world’s second largest company by market value.
* Apple’s stock went as high as $292.76 today, passing PetroChina to become the second largest stock in the world, right behind Exxon Mobil…
* I’m so glad I invested in some of these stocks. My advice to you, get on them too!
