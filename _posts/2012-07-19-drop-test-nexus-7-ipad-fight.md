* Google unveiled the Nexus 7 last month to much fanfare. And although its price and screen size don’t really line up with the latest iPad, many reviewers are still using Apple’s tablet as a point of reference.
* You’ve probably already seen all of the speed and performance comparisons between the two slates, but what about durability? That’s right it’s drop test time. Nexus 7 versus the iPad, round one, fight!
* The folks at SquareTrade have done it again. They’ve pitted two competing products against each other in a series of completely non-scientific drop tests to see which one proves more durable. And the winner?
* It would appear that the Nexus 7 comes out on top, thanks to its size, weight, and rubberized backing. Surprisingly, the tablet managed to survive a number of falls without suffering any major screen damage.
* It’s also impressive that the touch screens on both the Nexus 7 and iPad continued to work after being completely submerged in water. I’ve always found that severe water damage results in immediate malfunction.
* As we said before, these tests hold zero scientific value. And in the end, it’s probably a good idea to put a case on either tablet. But still, we have to admit, it’s always fun watching people intentionally break things.
* What’s your take on the drop test?
