title: Apple suing Samsung over autocorrect patent
---
* The battle between Apple and Samsung over patents has been going on for quite a while, and it seems there are new lawsuits every week. Yesterday, PaidContent reported that Apple has once again sued Samsung in a U.S District Court in San Jose, for two patents it was granted in December, adding to the mass of lawsuits already happening between the two companies.

* The first patent pertains to Apple’s famous autocorrect…
* One aspect of the invention involves a method that includes: in a first area of the touch screen, displaying a current character string being input by a user with the keyboard; in a second area of the touch screen, displaying the current character string or a portion thereof and a suggested replacement for the current character string […]
* The second patent Apple is suing Samsung over is “universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system.”
* Both Samsung and Apple have lawsuits occurring right now in over 10 countries. Both companies have tried to get injunctions for each other’s products, including in both the United States and Europe.
* Most recently in December, a California judge rejected Apple’s attempt to get an injunction on Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1. Apple has recently appealed the ruling.
* In other recent lawsuit news, Apple also sued Motorola over Qualcomm licenses today.
* The war between Samsung and Apple looks to be far from over. It’s pretty funny actually, seeing as Samsung manufactures the A5 chip for Apple’s iPhone 4S and iPad 2. It’s not clear if Samsung will be manufacturing the iPad 3’s rumored quad-core processor.
* Is Apple becoming a patent troll?
