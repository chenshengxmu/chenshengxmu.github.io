* Clockify is a recently released jailbreak tweak that takes the fundamentals of Live Clock, and gives it a modern iOS 5 update. With Clockify you can add a live functioning clock on your Home screen, along with adding world clocks to the Lock screen and Notification Center.
* There’s a fairly impressive amount of customization to be had with Clockify, as you’ll no doubt notice in our hands-on video walkthrough inside…
* Clockify brings the ability to add different clock faces to the Clock app icon on your Home screen, and will even dynamically change the color of the clock depending on the time of day. The Lock screen and Notification Center world clock capabilities are just extra icing on the cake.
* If you’re interested, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download it today for $1.00. Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
