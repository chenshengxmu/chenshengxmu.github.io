* Chris Lattner, a former star Apple engineer who built early versions of Apple’s Swift programming language in 2010 before a team was formed to further the project, has joined Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) team, according to his announcement on Twitter on Monday.
* He said he would start next week at Google Brain, the search giant’s research unit.
* Bloomberg reported today that Lattner will be working in some capacity on TensorFlow, Google’s system designed to simplify the programming steps for AI.
* Google released TensorFlow for free last year.
* I'm super excited to join Google Brain next week: AI can't democratize itself (yet?) so I'll help make it more accessible to everyone!

* In May, the search company unveiled a specialized chip designed for TensorFlow, called TPU, that it rents through its cloud-computing service.
* Lattner left Apple in January to join Tesla because the opportunity to head the Tesla Autopilot team as a Vice President was “irresistible.” He only lasted six months there, having left the electric car maker in June.
* “Chris just wasn’t the right fit for Tesla,” the car maker said at the time.
* “In the end, Elon and I agreed that he and I did not work well together and that I should leave, so I did,” Lattner wrote in an update to his resume.
