* In addition to Reminders, Calendar is another stock app on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad designed to help users organize their daily, weekly and yearly schedule and be more productive.
* With 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, it’s easier to accomplish things with fewer taps.
* Though not as developed as in other stock apps, Calendar’s 3D Touch implementation permits you to add an event from the Home screen and glimpse what’s coming up next on your schedule. In this tutorial, you will learn about 3D Touch shortcuts and Peek and Pop gestures in iOS 9’s Calendar app on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* Press Calendar’s Home screen icon and select Add Event in the 3D Touch shortcut menu, which will take you to the New Event screen within Calendar. The shortcut menu does not provide any other option nor does it surface any of your upcoming events or those that you have edited most recently.

* In weekly, daily or list view (shown below), press any event lightly to preview it with 3D Touch. While peeking, slide the finger upward to reveal the Delete Event option to quickly remove and delete the selected event from your calendar.

* Press a little harder to see your event full screen complete with a map of its location, if any, and other details. To edit the event, tap the Edit button.

* Tip: To quickly access your weekly calendar, just rotate your device sideways. 3D Touch works in landscape mode so you can press an event to take a peek at it, and swipe up to access additional options.

* Though it isn’t possible to preview a single past, current or upcoming event in yearly or monthly calendar view, you can glimpse your schedule for any given day in monthly and list views, as explained further below.

* To quickly see a day’s events with 3D Touch, press a date in monthly calendar view to peek at that day’s schedule. You cannot swipe up while peeking at an event to show actions but press a little deeper and the event list opens full screen.
