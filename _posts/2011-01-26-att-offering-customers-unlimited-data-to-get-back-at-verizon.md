* Reports are surfacing that AT&T is quietly offering certain customers the opportunity to switch back to unlimited data. This comes right on the heels of the revelation that Verizon will be offering $30 unlimited data for a limited time to early iPhone 4 adopters.
* If you can remember, it was back in June of 2010 when AT&T eliminated its unlimited data plans in favor of a tiered data package, and needless to say there was quite an outrage over the change.
* Now that Verizon has come on the scene, AT&T is feeling the heat and pulling out the stops in order to retain disgruntled customers…
* Customers who were originally on unlimited data plans were given the option to retain their plan, or switch to a lower priced, but limited data plan. Those who decided to switch were instructed that they would not be able to switch back to unlimited data, rendering the change permanent.
* Now, it looks like AT&T is backtracking on the pronouncement of the change’s permanence, by offering select customers who were originally on unlimited data the opportunity to switch back.
* We wonder if those ‘select’ customers are ones threatening to jump ship? That might be worth a shot if you want your unlimited back. No official comment from AT&T thus far.
* Have you been offered unlimited data, or did you never give it up to begin with?
