* iOS 8.1.2 met its end today, as Apple pulled the plug on its signing status. This means that iOS 8.1.2 can no longer be installed on a device, and as such, you can no longer jailbreak if you restore your device. Jailbreakers will need to stay where they are on iOS 8.1.2 if they want to keep their jailbreaks.
* As we outlined in a previous post, you can visit IPSW.me to check the signing status of any firmware. For example, if you wish to check out the status of iOS 8.1.2, just visit IPSW.me/8.1.2.
* The latest public firmware, iOS 8.1.3, breaks the current jailbreak, and we’ve heard little from the TaiG or Pangu teams about the release of a new jailbreak. Those of you who are currently jailbroken will need to stay satisfied with their current jailbroken device, and those who are not will have to wait patiently for a new jailbreak to arrive.
* That all said, the prospects of a new jailbreak are much better now than they have been in the past. The Chinese teams behind the last few jailbreaks have been pretty quick to get something out to the public, even if it’s still being worked on.
* What is your current jailbreak situation? Share down below in the comments.
