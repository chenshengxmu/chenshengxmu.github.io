* Following an unprecedented interest surrounding Apple’s upcoming developers conference this summer, with tickets selling out in under two minutes, the company is trying to make it easier for the folks who won’t be able to make it to WWDC this June 10-14. This past weekend, Apple via its portal for developers announced that Tech Talks are coming this Fall to a number of cities…
* “We’ll also be hitting the road this fall with Tech Talks in a city near you,” Apple wrote on its portal for developers.
* In October 2011, Tech Talk made its way to Berlin, London, Rome, Beijing, Seoul, Sao Paolo, New York City, Seattle and Austin. The events allowed developers to mingle with Apple engineers, with highly technical sessions focusing on the then new iOS 5 software.
* Apple is giving away 150 free WWDC tickets to young developers at its own discretion, as part of its WWDC 2013 Student Scholarship initiative. The company will be also offering WWDC session videos right during the conference.
* In addition to Apple’s official WWDC and Tech Talks events, an unofficial event called #AltWWDC will take place June 10-14, 2013 at the San Francisco State University’s Downtown Campus at 845 Market Street, only a block from the Moscone building.
