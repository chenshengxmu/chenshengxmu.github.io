* If you recently purchased an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, and are in the market for a minimalist case, this post is for you. We’ve rounded up some of our favorite minimalist cases for Apple’s new handset based on price, personal experience and customer reviews.
* So what qualifies as a “minimalist” case? Obviously the term is a bit subjective, but to us this means it has a subtle, unassuming design free of complex patterns and unsightly branding. They’re typically thinner, made of a single material, and solid in color.

* I like the Speck Presidio a lot, and it’s currently the one I’m using on my iPhone 7 Plus. These cases are going to run on the more expensive side, but I think you really get what you pay for here. This is the Presidio Clear, and it features a frosted see-through design so you can still see your iPhone. It’s been drop-tested to survive 8 foot falls, and it has raised bezel guards for added screen protection.
* You can buy the Speck Presidio Clear for your iPhone 7 for $39.95 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $44.95.

* For me, Incipio sits in a similar category as Speck. It’s a well-known brand that makes great-looking products using premium materials. This particular case is the NGP Pure. It’s made of a thin, flexible polymer material, it’s textured for added grip, and it’s semi-transparent. The Incipio logo is bigger than I like, but it’s not so big that it’s gaudy.
* You can buy the Incipio NGP Pure case for iPhone 7 for $19.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $19.99.
* I’m including the Totallee Scarf in this list, even though it was in our ultra-thin case roundup. The Scarf is the epitome of minimalism, featuring a solid-color design with no branding—or any graphics for that matter. It’s made of durable polypropylene plastic and measures just 0.02 inches thick. I had one of these on my iPhone 6 Plus and it feels more like a skin than a case.
* You can buy the Totallee Scarf case for iPhone 7 for $14.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $14.99.

* We like Spigen because of their ability to get affordable and well-designed cases to market quickly after new iPhones launch. This is their Air Cushion case, which features a clear, see-through back and TPU bumper for added grip. It also has raised bezels to protect your screen, pronounced buttons, and extra large port cutouts.
* You can buy this Spigen Air Cushion case for iPhone 7 for $11.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $13.99.

* Here’s another Incipio case for your consideration: the Feather. It features a rigid polycarbonate frame with scratch resistant coating, and a thin, snap-on design. I also really like that the top of the case is closed, keeping those edges protected during drops, but the bottom is completely open for easy access to your ports, speakers and mics. Available in several colors.
* You can buy the Incipio Feather case for your iPhone 7 for $24.99 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $24.99.
