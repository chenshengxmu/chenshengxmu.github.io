* It’s not known for sure whether Apple will unveil its smaller tablet during next week’s event, or at a separate gig in October. But according to a long line of reports from credible sources, it’s coming.
* And as the anticipated launch inches closer, more and more claimed parts have begun to surface. Tonight, we’ve come across photos of what is believed to be a legitimate iPad mini shell…
* Nowhereelse.fr reposts the pictures, which were originally published by NetEase, a Chinese news site. They show, in fairly great detail, the interior and exterior of a rear shell supposedly belonging to an iPad mini. The component was allegedly leaked from an equipment manufacturer in Shenzhen, China.

* Now, we’ve seen enough fakes and knockoffs in our day to maintain a high level of skepticism regarding purported Apple parts like this. But on the off chance that it’s real, it does offer up some intel.
* For starters, it has an opening for the smaller dock connector that Apple is expected to use in all future iOS devices, starting with the iPhone 5. There’s also a hole for a rear-facing camera — another presumed feature. Oddly enough, though, there’s no sign of a headphone jack at the bottom of this shell.
* Previous reports suggest that the iPad mini will house a 7.85-inch display, and will be about as thin as an iPod touch. But outside of that, and a rumored $200 price tag, very little is known about the device.
* Hopefully we’ll find out more in the coming weeks.
* What do you think about the claimed iPad mini shell in the above photos? Is it real, fake?
