* Bloomberg’s piece covering Apple’s renewed focus on software quality is full of unexpected tidbits related to some of the new features and enhancements in iOS 12 and macOS 10.14.
* One of the new features in iOS 12, according to Bloomberg News author Mark Gurman, includes “a redesigned interface used to import photos into an iPad on the go.”
* The report is short on details, but seems to refer to the interface that appears when importing photos directly from a USB source via Apple’s Lightning to USB Camera Adapter.
* It’s unclear why the story paints importing photos as an iPad-only feature.
* With iOS 9.2 and later, customers can actually take advantage of Apple’s adapter in order to import their DSLR photographs and other images stored on an SD card, a USB camera or other USB source into any Lightning-equipped iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* It’s entirely possible this overhauled UI has nothing to do with importing photos from a USB source, in which case it’s possible Apple might be planning to improve the photo-import process by enhancing existing features, like AirDrop, the “Open In” prompt and more.
* Other enhancements in iOS 12 apparently include an enhanced Do Not Disturb mode that will auto-reject phone calls and silence notifications, deeper Siri integration into iOS’s search view, Animoji improvements such as FaceTime and iPad support and other perks.
* What do you make of the report?
