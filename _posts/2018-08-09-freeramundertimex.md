* The iPhone X’s notch compelled Apple’s to redesign the handset’s Status Bar to make the best use possible of the free space available. The result doesn’t look that bad, but software tinkerers in the jailbreak community always find ways to improve trivial things of this nature.
* A prime example is a new free jailbreak tweak called FreeRAMUnderTimeX by iOS developer i4M1k0SU. Just as the name suggests, this tweak displays the amount of free RAM you have right under the time indicator in the iPhone X’s Status Bar.
* iOS automatically regulates your RAM usage for the best performance among your recently-used apps, and with a gracious 3GB of onboard RAM, the iPhone X almost never chokes up in daily usage. Nevertheless, it never hurts to see how much of your RAM isn’t be utilized.
* The free RAM indicator appears right beneath the Status Bar’s time indicator where iOS’ breadcrumb links typically appear. As you can see, it even plays nicely with Status Bar icons, such as the Location Services indicator.
* While not everyone enjoys seeing live hardware information on the face of their iPhone, it can be a great addition for more advanced users that like seeing what’s happening behind the scenes. Additionally, it may provide pointers as to why your device runs sluggish at times.
* With no options to configure, all you need to do is install FreeRAMUnderTimeX from Cydia and you’re all set. You’ll have to uninstall the tweak from Cydia if you ever want to disable it.
* If you’re interested in trying FreeRAMUnderTimeX, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Please note that the tweak is intended for jailbroken iPhone X handsets only, as it depends on Status Bar design specific to this device.
