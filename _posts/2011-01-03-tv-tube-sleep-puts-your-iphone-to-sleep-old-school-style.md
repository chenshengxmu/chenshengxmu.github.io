title: 'TV Tube Sleep' Puts Your iPhone to Sleep Old School Style

* This has to be one of the coolest jailbreak tweaks I’ve seen, from a purely eye-pleasing perspective: it puts your iPhone to sleep in the style of an old TV tube.
* I’ve always thought that the iPhone’s sleep animation (can I even call it that?) was pretty boring, so any tweak that adds some spice in this area is a welcome addition if you ask me…
* TV Tube Sleep features no app icon, or setting option; it starts working as soon as it’s installed. A press of the sleep button will invoke the TV tube animation from anywhere except the lock screen.
* I’m usually not really into tweaks that make visual changes to your iPhone, especially if they cost money, but TV Tube Sleep is a definite exception.
* For $0.99 cents on Cydia, I think it’s well worth the money for such a cool looking effect; a true throwback to yesteryear.
* What do you think?
