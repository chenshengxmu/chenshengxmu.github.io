* Apple has named the retro-futuristic 3D shooter ‘Space Qube‘ its App of the Week for this week. This means that you’ll be able to pick up the title for both your iPhone and iPad, for free through next Thursday—a solid savings of $2.99.
* In Space Qube, players are tasked with helping Space Jack in his campaign to save the universe. They are given the opportunity to build their own custom spaceship, and then must blast their way through levels of dangerous monsters.
* With Space Qube’s in-game Voxel editor you can create anything and take it for a spin in the space! There are tons of models already created and more is coming in – fast. Take control of a space ship, a flying toilet, a flying cow or anything else, shoot as many aliens as you can and get the highest score to climb up the ranks. Some serious unique bosses are waiting for you on your quest!
* And you can do more than virtually fly your custom spaceship. You can also share it online with other players, and download their creations to play with. You can even send your craft to a 3D printer, so you can play with the ship in person.
* The game plays like a futuristic 3D cousin of Asteroids, and is enjoyable in short bursts, but you will run into in-app purchases. At any rate, Space Qube is worth putting in your Purchases tab while it’s free. You can find it in the App Store.
