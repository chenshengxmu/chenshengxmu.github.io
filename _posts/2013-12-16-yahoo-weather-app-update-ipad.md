* Yahoo posted a significant update for its weather app this weekend, bringing the software to version 1.5. The update includes the ability to share the weather via Mail, Messages and social media, as well as iPad support.
* That’s right. Folks who really like the beautiful design, layout, and interactions of the iPhone Yahoo Weather app—things that made it one of the most popular weather apps of 2013—can now experience it on their tablet…
* Here’s your 1.5 change log:
* Yahoo Weather – now for iPad! – The design, layout, and interactions you love optimized for the larger screen – Experience stunning, interactive animations as you scroll through the forecast
* Share the weather – On iPhone, share a screenshot via Mail, Messages, Facebook, or Twitter by selecting “Share” in the sidebar – On iPad, share by selecting the share icon on the home screen or “Share” in the sidebar
* And another iPad screenshot:

* There’s really not much else to say here. While it lacks some of the more advanced features, Yahoo Weather is one of the best-looking Weather apps available. So if you don’t need all of the extra fluff, it’s worth checking out.
* If you’re interested, you can find the now universal Yahoo Weather app in the App Store for free.
