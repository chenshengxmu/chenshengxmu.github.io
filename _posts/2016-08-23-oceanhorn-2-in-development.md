* Inspired by Nintendo’s wildly popular Legend of Zelda console game series, Oceanhorn by Cornfox & Bros is one of the best-looking, most satisfying RPG-based action adventure games “for the rest of us” that I’ve had a blast playing on my iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.
* Ever since completing the game, I’ve been rooting for Oceanhorn’s developers to make a sequel and now, GameMob points us to the official confirmation that it’s indeed being worked on as we speak.
* Titled Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm, the game’s mechanics are based on a third-person camera angle versus the original game’s isometric view. The storyline revolves around a new hero—a grown-up boy who is training to become a Knight of Arcadia.
* For starters, it should be noted that Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm is set in another time period on the Oceanhorn timeline.
* The sequel should guarantee superb audio experience just like in Oceanhorn because Kalle Ylitalo, who composed the original soundtrack, is back to create some catchy fantasy tunes for Oceanhorn 2. Sound designer and foley artist Tapio Liukkonen is also in charge of the sequel’s audio experience.
* Before we go any further, watch the promotional video for the sequel.
* And now, read the developers’ pitch for Oceanhorn 2:
* The game is played from a third person camera angle that will take players right into the heat of action and allows them to explore even the smallest details of Arcadia. Our battle system consists of sword fighting, utilizing powerful spells and finding creative ways to use various items that Hero discovers on his travels.
* Caster, a gun in Oceanhorn 2 that shoots magical projectiles, will have many uses in the game, from puzzle solving to luring enemies and casting directed spells.

* Ocenhorn 2 has trademark elements that have made the original game popular:
* Oceanhorn 2 will be built upon the same elements that were the heart and soul of the first Oceanhorn game: exploring a colorful world, a deep backstory with secrets and twists, amazing music, and most importantly—classic Action RPG gameplay with items, puzzles, battles, and badass bosses!
* So far so good!
* Oceanhorn 2’s vast world map consists of fields, forests, mountains and water, acting as a hub between levels, dungeons and towns. The game has been in development for little over a year and the core development team has now grown to five people.

* “For us, Oceanhorn 2 is the fulfillment of a JRPG dream,” developers concluded.
* Oceanhorn 2 should release in the upcoming months, with more updates coming from the developers as we inch closer to launch. On a related note, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas will be available on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 7.
* Oceanhorn is $8.99 on the App Store.
* That’s actually a steal for such a high-quality premium release. There are no In-App Purchases in Oceanhorn, the quality of graphics and visuals in this game is top notch, the storyline grasps you in no time and the execution is superb.
* If you’re a fan of Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda game series, Oceanhorn is the closest thing to The Legend of Zelda you’ll play on iOS.
