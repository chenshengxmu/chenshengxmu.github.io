* SiriBoard is a simple jailbreak tweak that places a shortcut to Siri directly on your iPhone’s SpringBoard.
* This will allow you to launch Siri from any Home screen page, or even place the shortcut into your dock or in a folder.
* Personally, I think holding the Home button is the most efficient way to launch Siri, but perhaps you feel otherwise?
* If so, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download FreeManRepo’s creation for free.
* You will of course need Siri enabled on your jailbroken device, which means you have an iPhone 4S, or you use Spire on an older device.
* Let us know what your feelings are on SiriBoard below.
