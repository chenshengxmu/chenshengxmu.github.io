* One of the nice luxury features that Apple includes with its premium Keynote presentation software is the ability to use the mobile app on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad as a remote for giving presentations from Keynote on your Mac.
* It’s a great tool for educators and students to use in the classroom, but such abilities also work great in various work environments unrelated to educational institutions, such as business meetings at work.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to use Apple’s mobile Keynote app as a remote for controlling a presentation from Keynote on your Mac.
* Apple seems to have phased out the older separate Keynote Remote app for iOS; you really don’t even need it anymore, because Apple has integrated the functionality right into the mobile version of the Keynote presentation software for iOS, which for many is a free download after buying a new iOS device.
* Whenever you want to give a presentation from the Keynote app from your Mac, it will probably be easier for you to use your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad as a remote than to walk up to your computer to strike a key or tap a trackpad every time you’re ready to move to the next slide.
* To use the mobile Keynote app as a remote for the desktop app on your Mac, you can follow these steps:
* 1) Download and install the Keynote app on both your iOS device and your Mac. If you bought your Mac and iOS device from Apple recently, both should be a free download; otherwise, it’s $19.99 for the desktop app and $9.99 for the mobile app.
* 2) Make sure that your iOS device and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network, or that both have Bluetooth enabled, then Launch the Keynote app on both your iOS device and Mac.
* 3) From the Mac Keynote app, launch a presentation file that you wish to control remotely.
* 4) From the iOS app, tap on the Remote button in the top left of the navigation bar.

* And that’s all there is to it!
* Not only can you control your Keynote presentation by swiping to move from slide to slide, but you can also annotate, and do all sorts of other fun stuff while you’re connected to your Keynote app from your iOS device.

* Because Keynote is compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint files, you can bet your sweet bippie that this method works for presenting PowerPoint files too, so even if you’re not presenting a Keynote file, as long as you open your PowerPoint file in Keynote on your Mac, you can use this method to share it with your audience from a remote distance from your Mac.
* Additionally, Keynote on the iPhone supports an Apple Watch app, which means you can also use your Apple Watch to move back and forth between slides on your Mac.

* It’s super convenient to use your iOS device as a remote for when you’re giving presentations from Keynote on your Mac, but it also lets your devices collaborate with one another to create a very seamless presentation experience for you and your audience.
* With the PowerPoint compatibility, ability to annotate, and even the Apple Watch support, this is a great way to stay away from your Mac while you’re trying to communicate with your audience and to have really good control over your presentation from a remote distance.
