* Following the release of iOS 12 GM earlier today, Apple has also pushed out developer software updates for Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. 
* The new software updates released today for registered developers include:
* Given that Apple didn’t announce any new Mac products at today’s “Gather round” event, it’s not a surprise that it didn’t announce a GM version of macOS Mojave. That should be coming soon, however, since Apple plans on releasing macOS Mojave to the public on Monday, Sept. 24.
* Registered developers can find these software updates through Apple’s regular software channels.
* If we find anything new with any of these software updates, we’ll let you know by updating this post.
