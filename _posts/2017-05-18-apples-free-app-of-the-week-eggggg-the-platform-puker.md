* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Eggggg – The Platform Puker. For the next 7 days you can pick up the popular platformer for free on both iPhone and iPad — a solid savings of $3.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* A severe allergy to eggs isn’t funny—unless it hatches a fantastic voyage through a world of golden nuggets, homicidal chickens, and puke. So. Much. Puke. The controls in this bizarrely clever platformer are spot on, but sometimes we’re giggling so hard at our barf-propelled hero that we slip up and die laughing. It truly is an Eggggg-cellent adventure.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Again, Eggggg – The Platform Puker is available in the App Store for free.
