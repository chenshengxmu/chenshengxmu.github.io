* Apple’s iPhone event is now less than a day away, and anticipation couldn’t be higher. Two redesigned iPhones with larger displays and NFC, a new mobile payment service, and the iWatch, Apple’s first major product unveiling since the iPad, are just a few things on the menu.
* Apple has said that it will be streaming the festivities to its website and various iOS devices, but for those who won’t be able to watch the keynote live, iDB has you covered. We will be here all day, providing coverage of all announcements made before, during and after the event.
* Expect to see the website updated frequently throughout the day tomorrow, as we attempt to deliver the news as quickly and as accurately as possible. We will be covering Apple’s keynote live, and will be providing commentary on all major announcements and subsequent reports.
* So what time does it all go down tomorrow? The event itself is slated to begin at 10 a.m. PST (Pacific Standard Time). That’s 11 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, 12 p.m. Central Time, and 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. And for all our overseas readers, look for the event to begin at:
* The event is being held at De Anza College’s Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California. It says something that the building seats around 2,400 people—several times the amount of typical venues—and Apple has even erected a mysterious 2-story structure adjacent to it.
* Apple says you’ll be able to watch the event live via its website using Safari on OS X and iOS, and we’ll likely see the usual ‘Apple Events’ channel pop up on the Apple TV in the morning. For folks who can’t watch it live, keynotes are typically uploaded to YouTube by the end of the day.
* As aforementioned, the consensus is that we’re going to see two new iPhones tomorrow: a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch model, as well as an all-new mobile payment service, and the long-awaited iWatch. For a complete rundown of what we expect to see at the event, checkout our roundup here.
* Some folks have speculated that this is going to be Apple’s biggest keynote since the original iPhone, and looking at all of the evidence—the larger venue, the website countdown timer, etc.—it’s hard to disagree. Make sure you tune into iDB tomorrow, this is one event you don’t want to miss.
