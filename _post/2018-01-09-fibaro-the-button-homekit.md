* Smart home accessory manufacturer Fibaro has launched their latest product here at CES 2018, dubbed The Button, which lets you perform any number of tasks by the press of… a button. It will even support Apple’s HomeKit platform, though not at launch.
* The tiny accessory is a battery-powered control which can perform endless automation tasks. As a few examples, you could configure it to order a pizza, turn on the lights, alert someone when you need assistance and much more.
* If you go the HomeKit route, your options are slightly more limited to working with HomeKit accessories, but there’s still much to do. This is very much similar to the other smart buttons we saw before, like Logitech’s Pop button and Elgato’s Eve Button.
* Aside from HomeKit, it also supports Z-Wave accessories.

* You are not limited to a sole function with The Button.
* In fact, you can set up to six different commands. For example, you could set it up so that lights come on for a single press, garage door closes for two presses and blinds open for three presses.
* The Button will go on sale in the first quarter of 2018 in Red, Black and White for $59.99, with additional color options to be made available later in the year.
