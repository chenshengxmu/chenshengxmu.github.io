* It’s been nearly 10 years since the first Beats by Dr. Dre headphones were first produced. To celebrate this anniversary, Apple has revealed a new Beats “Decade Collection,” which goes on sale on Friday, June 1. 
* The collection adds a special “Defiant Black-Red” color scheme to five products in the Beats lineup, including the Studio3 Wireless, Solo3 Wireless, Powerbeats3 Wireless, BeatsX Wireless, and urBeats3. This color scheme features black with prominent red accents that highlight the Beats logo, driver housings, and cabling.
* Some of the products also include extra markings. For example, the Studio3 Wireless consists of a debossed “EST 08” on the left earpad, while the included clamshell carrying case reads “TEN YRS.”
* Though limited, each product in the collection is available for the same price as the regular models:

* Founded in 2006 by rapper Dr. Dre and record industry mogul Jimmy Iovine, Beats initially sold audio products through a partnership with Monster Cable. The first Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones arrived in 2008. Three years later, HTC paid $309 million for a 51 percent stake in the company.
* Not long before Apple acquired Beats in 2014, Dr. Dre and Iovine had repurchased control of the company. Cupertino ended up paying $3 billion for Beats, making both owners billionaires. Since then, the Beats product line has continued to grow and could soon include the first Beats-branded Siri-controlled smart speaker.
* If you’re interested in making a purchase from the Decade Collection, you should consider visiting Best Buy. At the time of this writing, the Studio3 Wireless, Solo3 Wireless, and Powerbeats3 models are on sale, most likely for a limited time. You can find more tech specials through our Daily Deals.
