* We know, you’re getting sick of the iPhone rumors, too. However, bear with us for a second.
* The above photo of delicious sushi was taken on an iPhone 5. Not only that, but the photo in question was taken from inside Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino…
* PocketNow has what appears to be the first publicly leaked photo taken on an iPhone 5. The shot was taken on an 8 megapixel camera, and there’s more evidence in the EXIF data:
* “This (very attractive) photo claims to have been taken by an iPhone 4, but the rest of its EXIF data tells a different story: although the image has been cropped to 2235×2291 (5.12 megapixels), the original picture was a much larger 3264×2448 — or just shy of eight megapixels. What’s more, the lens was recorded as a 4.3mm f/2.4, which is closer to that of a point-and-shoot than the iPhone 4′s actual 3.85mm f/2.8.”
* It’s been a long-standing rumor that the next flagship iPhone model will sport a 8 megapixel camera. The image resolution is larger than what the iPhone 4’s sensor can capture, and case leaks have indicated that the iPhone 5 will be slightly larger than the iPhone 4, while remaining thinner in width.
* 9to5Mac notes the location data of this photo:

* MacRumors has discovered the photo’s original origin on Flickr. The photo was posted by an iOS engineer working on Safari and WebKit at Apple. Presumably, he was enjoying a nice lunch when this picture was taken.
* The iPhone 5 is very real, folks. And soon you’ll be able to take pictures of your sushi with its fancy 8 megapixel camera, too!
