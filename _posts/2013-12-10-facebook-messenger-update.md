* Last month, Facebook released version 3.0 of its popular Messenger app. The update was significant because it featured an all-new UI design for the app, bringing its aesthetics more in line with those introduced by Apple in iOS 7.
* Today, the client received another update, bringing it to version 3.1. This time Facebook added a few new convenience features that will allow you to access a person’s Timeline or call them (toll-free) by simply tapping on their picture…
* From the App Store description page:
* – Get to your messages without opening Facebook. – Bring your conversations to life with stickers. – Send photos privately. – Have group conversations and make plans on the go. – Text your phone contacts, even if you’re not Facebook friends. – Share your location so people know when you’re nearby. – Record voice messages. – Make free calls, even to friends in other countries. 
* – Tap on someone’s profile picture in any conversation to view their Timeline or call for free. – Bug fixes, including improved Japanese translations. 
* Facebook’s Messenger continues to run into stiff competition from other apps like WhatsApp and SnapChat. But the recent iOS 7 redesign has been well-received, and the app is currently ranked #4 in the US App Store’s Top Charts for free apps.
* You can download the latest version of Facebook Messenger from the App Store for free.
