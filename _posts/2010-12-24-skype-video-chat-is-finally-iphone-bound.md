* Either the guys at Skype got the memo, or this was in the works all along, and they’re just a bit slow going about their business. Better late than never, right?
* Just as Apple is gaining steam with its relatively new FaceTime video chat, here comes the blue elephant in the room. While I didn’t hesitate to give Skype a needed shellacking in a previous article, one thing’s for sure, if they get on the ball with mobile video chat, it could be a hard ball to stop.
* Even with FaceTime continuing to gain footprint in various other areas with the upcoming iPad, and the recent desktop Beta release; all it would take is for Skype to release a decent competitor to make things interesting…
* The cool thing with Skype is that it’s platform independent, meaning it’ll run on Android, Windows Mobile, iOS, your toaster, whatever. If Skype releases a competent product across all of those platforms, it would instantly be the reigning king in the mobile video chat arena.
* Sounds great, and it’s nice to see that even iPhone 3GS owners are shown some love here. No firm news on a release date yet, but CES is just a couple of weeks away… take that for what it’s worth.
* Do you think this news spells doom for FaceTime?
