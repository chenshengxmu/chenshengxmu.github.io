* French publication NowhereElse.fr today published a purported video which seemingly shows off an alleged rear shell thought to be for the bigger iPhone 6 model, giving fans a good look at how the rumored 5.5-inch handset might feel in one’s hand.
* The publication adds that the bigger iPhone has inherited the ‘Air’ moniker, first used in respect to iOS devices with the release of the iPad Air.
* The iPhone maker is expected to announce the iPhone 6 alongside a wearable device at a media event scheduled for Tuesday, September 9, at Cupertino’s Flint Center for the Performing Arts.
* Here, check out the video.
* Like a flurry of leaked components of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, this alleged rear shell exhibits the same design features spotted on the 4.7-incher.
* Specifically, these includes a rounder all-metal appearance, the elongated volume buttons, a cutout for the Apple logo, a circular hole for a redesigned True Tone flash and, of course, the famous antenna breaks across the top and bottom.
* According a Google Translate version of the report filed by NowhereElse.fr editor Steve Hemmerstoffer, the 5.5-inch handset should be marketed under the ‘iPhone Air’ moniker.
* This would fall in line with Apple’s iPad naming scheme, where the full-size edition of the tablet goes under the iPad Air moniker, as opposed to its smaller 7.9-inch counterpart, the iPad mini.
* The 5.5-inch iPhone 6 is rumored to be entering production in September.
* The rumor-mill speculates that even though Apple will show off both 4.7 and 5.5-inch versions of the handset, only the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will go on sale later in September, with the larger model ostensibly scheduled to arrive later in the year.
