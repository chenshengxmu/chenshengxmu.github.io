* Apple is suffering harsh criticism over its in-house mapping solution in iOS 6 which has for better or worse effectively replaced a Google Maps-backend. Apple Maps have been called a disaster waiting to happen and even pundit John Gruber called the system a downgrade. With more than 65 percent of the world’s population left with no transit directions, traffic data and street-level imagery, Apple Maps understandably drew ire from users around the world.
* No wonder nearly 85 percent of our readers think Google should write a native Maps app for iOS, just as it’s done with the excellent YouTube iOS app. Commenting on the situation, Google UK Marketing Director Dan Cobley asserted that a standalone app could be released soon…
* Dan Cobley told Bloomberg TV today:
* iPhone 5 users can still use Google Maps just by download them or going to the Google Maps website.
* That’s an unusual way of putting it.
* Last time I checked, there was no standalone Google Maps app to download from the App Store and I doubt he meant the Google Earth app.
* Cobley probably wanted to urge people to add maps.google.com to their home screen because the web-version of Google Maps supports transit, directions and other features.
* By the way, whatever happened to ridiculing web apps?
* SearchEngineLand pressed Google on the matter, but only got this prepared statement:
* We believe Google Maps are the most comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use maps in the world. Our goal is to make Google Maps available to everyone who wants to use it, regardless of device, browser, or operating system.
* According to both TheUnderstatement.com and Apple’s own website, 51 countries have no access to Transit data in iOS 6 Maps, 24 countries lost traffic data, 41 countries are without access to Street View and 20 countries don’t support turn-by-turn navigation and 3D Flyovers.
* For more horror stories on iOS 6 Maps, I advise checking out this TechCrunch post.
* Also, Garmin is looking to fill the void by updating its navigation apps with public transit, Street View and other much-needed features though convincing iOS 6 users to pay for these capabilities could prove a challenge.
* 9to5Mac has put together a nice list of third-party apps that help you get back some of the missing or lacking functionality in Apple Maps.
* Is Apple’s mapping solution in iOS 6 a dud?
