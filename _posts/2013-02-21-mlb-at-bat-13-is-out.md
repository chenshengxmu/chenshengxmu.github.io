* Good news sports fans! Spring Training for Major League Baseball teams officially started yesterday. This means that all players who are not participating in the World Baseball Classic next month have begun preparing for the 2013 season.
* This also means that the next several weeks will be chock-full with pre-season games and commentary, and news and updates on your favorite teams and players. And what better way to keep up with it all, than the MLB At Bat 13 app…
* MLB.com’s At Bat app for iOS is one of the most highly-regarded sports titles on Apple’s platform. It offers in-game audio, live video streams, highlights, news and more for the entire MLB season, from Spring Training to the World Series.
* And it’s just been updated for the 2013 season:
* The app will see more content and features added when the actual MLB season begins next month.
* For those who aren’t familiar with the At Bat service, let me break it down. You’ll need to purchase a subscription plan to take advantage of most of its features. And the options are $19.99 for the full 2013 MLB season, or $2.99 per month.
* The app itself, however, is free. And as usual, you can find it in the App Store.
