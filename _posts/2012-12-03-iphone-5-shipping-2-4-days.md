* In another display of Apple catching up to iPhone demand, the company’s online store in New Zealand is now quoting 2-4 business days for deliveries. It was only a week ago that the New Zealand store indicated shipping times were improving to one week. Prior to that, it took Apple about a month following the iPhone 5 launch to improve delivery times for online orders from 2-3 weeks to one week. The online US store gave us a one-week shipping estimate at press time but we’re expecting international stores to follow suit and update estimates later in the day…
* Analyst Gene Munster in October warned that iPhone 5 supply was “extremely limited”. Mid-November, fellow watcher Sterne Agee’ Shawn Wu reported the iPhone 5 supply crunch had “much improved”.
* Wu predicted Apple would sell 46.5 million smartphones during the December quarter, just below Munster’s forecast of 49 million units.
* What are you seeing?
* Has iPhone availability in your country’s online Apple store improved to 2-4 business days yet?
