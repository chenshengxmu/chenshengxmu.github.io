* Apple briefly talked about a new version of AirPods at its presentation today at the Steve Jobs Theater, mentioning that an improved set of earbuds come with a case that supports wireless charging via industry-standard Qi wireless charger.
* In fact, Apple is prepping its own wireless charging pad, due for release in 2018, that supports multiple devices. You will simply rest your iPhone X, the new Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods on the accessory and all of them will be charged wirelessly, and simultaneously.
