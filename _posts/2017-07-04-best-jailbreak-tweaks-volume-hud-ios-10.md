* Perhaps one of the worst experiences in iOS out of the box is the volume HUD; it’s clunky and appears right in the middle of the screen as you try to get things done.
* Since it gets in the way so much, jailbreak developers have been creating alternative solutions for years, and in this roundup, we’ll be talking about the best volume HUD-based jailbreak tweaks that work great with the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10.
* 1. ByeByeHUD

* ByeByeHUD is a volume HUD replacement that offers three different options to pick from. All of the styles, illustrated above, keep the volume HUD out of the center of the screen for your convenience.
* All the styles serve the purpose of making the volume HUD footprint smaller, but each also comes with their own pros and cons, functionally and aesthetically.
* To learn more about what ByeByeHUD has to offer, we recommend reading our full review.
* 2. HUDPlayer

* HUDPlayer directly addresses the problem with the volume HUD being in the center of the screen by converting the volume HUD into a banner notification-style interface. It also integrates metadata information about Now Playing media. If you aren’t playing anything, a ringer icon is displayed instead, so it’s versatile enough for any scenario.
* Because HUDPlayer appears at the top of the screen, it isn’t as intrusive as the stock volume HUD is and you can continue to see things and touch the screen even while it’s showing.
* To learn more about why HUDPlayer is a must-have, read our full review.
* 3. PulseHUD

* PulseHUD is one of the most creative volume HUDs I’ve ever seen. It’s unique because rather than showing a slider or progress far to display your volume changes, it makes the screen pulse every time you press a volume button.
* Unlike traditional volume HUD tweaks PulseHUD doesn’t actually display any information about your volume level; instead, it just indicates when a button is pressed. With that in mind, it can make discerning your volume level more difficult unless you adjust by sound.
* PulseHUD works best as a complementary tweak to go alongside another volume HUD tweak, but some might like using it the way it comes without fuss.
* To learn more about what makes PulseHUD unique, read our full review.
* 4. Sonus

* Sonus is a volume HUD alternative that comes with a toolbox full of customization options to get the look and feel you’ve always wanted.
* It starts by moving everything up towards the top of the display, a huge step forward from being smack in the middle of the screen. You can also configure various elements of the interface, such as appearance, animations, size, and position, among other things.
* To learn more about Sonus and all of the options it comes with, read our full review.
* 5. StatusbarVolume

* About as simple as it comes, StatusbarVolume compressed the otherwise bulky and unnecessarily-large stock volume HUD into a space no taller than your Status Bar. The background of the new volume HUD is white, while the filler bar is black.
* You can also slide on the bar with your finger to adjust your volume or use your volume buttons (whichever is more convenient for you). The tweak can even be configured to work with media only, ringer only, or both.

* 6. StatusHUD 2

* StatusHUD 2 is a great option for fixing the audacity of the stock volume HUD. While it’s not a new tweak by any means, it didn’t feel right to make a volume HUD jailbreak tweak roundup without at least mentioning this classic.
* It works perfectly on iOS 10 despite not saying so in Cydia, and because it moves the volume HUD into the Status Bar, it keeps your volume information out of your way no matter what you’re doing.
* There are only a few options to configure, such as choosing the shape of the volume dots in the Status Bar, but apart from that, it’s essentially what it looks like at face value.
* You can read our full review of the original StatusHUD to learn more about why it withstands the test of time.
* 7. WAStatusVolume

* WAStatusVolume is perhaps one of my favorite volume HUD replacements as of late because of just how minimalist it is.
* This tweak takes a WhatsApp-inspired approach to fixing the volume HUD problem in iOS by putting a little volume indicator on your screen that can be placed anywhere you want it to be. Moreover, its size means it really never gets in the way of anything.
* You can customize a range of elements regarding the tweak, from color, to alpha level, to how long it stays on the screen.
* To learn more about what makes WAStatusVolume different from the rest, we recommend reading our full review.
* 8. YouTubeVolume

* Video consumption is one of the things you can do in iOS where the stock volume HUD gets in the way a lot, and YouTube was quick to create their own in-app volume HUD that appears at the top of the screen, out of the way of video content.
* YouTubeVolume is a tweak that takes the ingenious volume HUD design from the YouTube app and applies it on a system-wide scale so the volume HUD stays out of the way no matter what you’re doing in any app.
* You can learn more about YouTubeVolume in our full review.
