* The unlimited data plan, for all intents and purposes, is dead on two of America’s largest wireless carriers. Both AT&T and Verizon recently switched to Shared data plans, and they’re not looking back.
* But while other operators are eradicating the unlimited plan, T-Mobile is embracing it. The carrier just announced that it is going to start offering new unlimited, unthrottled data plans next month…
* From the press release:
* “T-Mobile USA, Inc., today announced an industry first — a truly Unlimited Nationwide 4G Data plan. Featuring no data caps, speed limits or bill shock, as well as fast, dependable nationwide 4G coverage. T-Mobile’s new Unlimited Nationwide 4G Data plan offers the ultimate worry-free experience.”
* The new Unlimited 4G Data plan will cost just $20 per month when added to a Value voice and text plan, or $30 per month when added to a Classic voice and text plan. It will be available starting September 5.
* And now the big question: will T-Mobile finally land the iPhone this fall? Probably not. Apple’s smartphone is usually costly for carriers, especially up front. And for T-Mobile, who’s struggling to stay afloat financially as it is, it doesn’t seem likely it could pull off an iPhone deal and these new unlimited plans.
* That being said, the carrier has announced that it is going to be rolling out iPhone-friendly network enhancements this fall. So even if it’s not an official partner, you could still activate an unlocked device.
* It’ll be interesting to see how this strategy plays out for T-Mobile. The only other major nationwide carrier that offers unlimited data plans is Sprint. And it’s maintained that that could change at anytime.
