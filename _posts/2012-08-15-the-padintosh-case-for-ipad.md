* In the overcrowded world of iPad cases, an accessory manufacturer has to make its covers extremely unique to stand out. Well it doesn’t get much more unique than this.
* Meet the Padintosh Case for iPad. The cover promises to bring out the Macintosh geek in you with its nostalgic 1984 Mac design, while still protecting your 2012 tablet…
* The Padintosh Case looks great, and the details are spot on. Notice the loaded floppy disk drive, and the beveling around the monitor. And yes, that’s MacPaint on the display.
* But the Padintosh isn’t all show. The hard casing is precision cut for a tight fit and maximum protection. It’s also only 2mm thick, and is compatible with Smart Covers.
* The case works with both second and third generation iPads, and is surprisingly inexpensive. If you’re interested, you can find the Padintosh over at ThinkGeek for just $24.99.
* What do you think of the Padintosh Case?
