* Apple has released the sixth Developer Preview of its new OS X Yosemite operating system this morning. The update comes exactly two weeks after Preview 5, and over two months after Apple first announced Yosemite during its Developer Conference in June.
* The update is labeled as build preview 6 1.0 and can be downloaded via the Mac App Store, or as a full download from Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s recently-launched public Yosemite Beta Seed program yet…
* The previous beta brought about just a handful of tiny changes, including tweaked Volume and Brightness HUD icons, a new option in Safari to show a website’s full URL, and a more translucent UI for Calculator . There were also a few tweaks to the Settings app.
* We’re currently installing Developer Preview 6 ourselves, and will be reporting back with any changes, so make sure you keep checking back with us throughout the day. If you find something not mentioned here, feel free to e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
* – Redesigned icons in System Preferences
* – New option to send Apple your diagnostics and usage data, similar to iOS
* – New Image Capture and External drive icons
* – New MacBook charging icon in status bar
* – Do Not Disturb is back in Notification Center
* – New wallpapers
* – New dashboard display options
