* Hot on the heels of releasing iOS 10.3 with Find My AirPods and other improvements and watchOS 3.2 for Apple Watch with Theater Mode and Siri in apps, Apple also today posted the fourth major update to its desktop operating system powering Macs. The software update is now rolling out via Mac App Store’s Updates tab.

* You can access Night Shift for Mac in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri.
* A dedicated preference pane makes it easy to quickly adjust when a Mac’s display should start gradually shifting from blue to yellow in order to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is said to cause sleeping problems.
