* China Mobile is the world’s largest wireless carrier with 600+ million subscribers, and it doesn’t have the iPhone yet. While we’ve heard a lot of speculation that Apple will soon be joining forces with the provider, we haven’t really known when to expect a done deal.
* We recently heard rumors that the two companies had agreed on a TD-LTE smartphone, but that’s not likely until sometime next year. So will Apple tap China Mobile’s enormous customer base before then? RBC Capital Markets’ Mike Abramsky seems to think so…
* The analyst cited a report from Chinese news site ccidcom.com yesterday, claiming that China Mobile has entered an agreement with Apple to sell the iPhone 4 by the end of October. Why would Apple launch a smartphone that’s over a year old in a gadget-hungry country like China?
* This could be another indication that Apple is planning on releasing a cheaper version of the iPhone 4 this Fall. We’ve been hearing rumors recently that the Cupertino company would go after the prepaid market with a retooled version of its current smartphone.
* Keep in mind that prepaid plans far outnumber the postpaid folks in places like Asia and Latin America. Obviously price is a major factor in these markets because the phones aren’t subsidized, so Apple would have to make the iPhone substantially less expensive to compete.
* Combine this information with the above report that China Mobile has inked a deal for the iPhone 4 this year, and I’m starting to think this iPhone 4 Lite business might have some truth to it.
* What do you think?
