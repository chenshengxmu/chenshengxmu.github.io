* Electronic Arts-owned studio PopCap released the highly anticipated sequel to its popular Plants vs. Zombies game on the 16th of August, and it only took them two weeks to rack up a staggering 25 million downloads.
* As you can imagine, this played out very well for Apple, as the game has been and still is an iOS-exclusive. And according to a report, the Cupertino company paid EA a ‘truckload’ of money to make that happen…
* Giant Bomb has the story, which spawned from comments made by EA’s Frank Gibeu at a company town hall meeting.
* “Apple gave us a truckload of money to delay the Android version [of Plants vs Zombies 2],” said Frank Gibeau, head of EA Labels.
* Giant Bomb confirmed the quote with several sources who watched the presentation today. 
* It is unclear what a “truckload of money” means, and we have no further details on the apparent agreement between Apple and EA. Apple has not yet responded to my requests for comment. “
* Both Apple and EA have commented on the report, with an Apple spokesperson saying that ‘no money was exchanged,’ and Electronic Arts issuing a statement saying that Gibeu’s comments were taken out of context:
* “A comment from an internal meeting taken out of context has created an unfortunate misunderstanding. Reports of a paid relationship between Apple and EA are factually inaccurate, and we apologise for any confusion.”
* Giant Bomb speculates that the deal between EA and Apple probably didn’t include a briefcase full of cash as Gibeu’s comments suggest. It was more likely a marketing deal, giving it prominent App Store placement.
* Either way, this is the first time we’ve ever heard of Apple being involved in a deal like this, and it suggests the company is taking the gaming space more seriously. It also just added support for game controllers in iOS 7.
* What do you make of all of this?
