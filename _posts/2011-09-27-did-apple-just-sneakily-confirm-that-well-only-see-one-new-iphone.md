title: Did Apple Just Sneakily Confirm That We'll Only See One New iPhone?

* Today Apple sent out invites for its October 4th media event where the curtain will be lifted on all things iPhone.
* Interestingly, the image that Apple used on the invites may provide a clue as to what we can see come October 4th at 10:00am PST.
* The image contains the Apple 1 Infinite Loop campus in the Maps app (where the event will be held), the correct date (Calendar app), the correct time (Clock app), and one more little interesting tidbit…
* Did your eagle eyes catch it? That’s right, a one (1) notification badge on the Phone app. Now of course, this could just be a coincidence, but seeing as everything else coincides with a real world fact, I think it’s highly probable that Apple just confirmed that we’ll only see one iPhone on October 4th.
* Not to mention that fact that the message says “Let’s talk iPhone.” Singular.
* Apple may have also just hinted at the super secret “Assistant” feature that was detailed yesterday.
* This could also be Apple’s method of easily letting down any ridiculously high expectations for next Tuesday’s event.
* What do you think?
