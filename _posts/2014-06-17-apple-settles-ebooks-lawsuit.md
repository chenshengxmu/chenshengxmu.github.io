* Apple has settled with U.S. states and consumers that were seeking damages for alleged price fixing on e-books, protecting itself from a trial where it could have faced up to $840 million in claims. Bloomberg was first to report on the news, claiming that a trial had been set for July after Apple was found to be conspiring with book publishers to raise e-book prices as part of an illegal scheme… 
* Apple has avoided that trial, which resulted from it working with book publishers to raise e-book prices to fight against Amazon’s often below-cost prices. “Steve Berman, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said by phone that all the U.S. attorneys general and consumers settled the case,” the report claims. “Berman said he filed a memorandum of understanding with the court under seal, which prevents him from describing the agreement.”

* Apple has been accused of e-books price fixing for over two years. In April 2012, the Department of Justice found Apple and the five biggest book publishers to be conspiring to raise the prices of e-books. Apple was found guilty of price fixing in July 2013 and given a separate trial for damages. In February, Apple was hit with this new $840 million lawsuit that it has now resolved outside of the courtroom.
* Essentially, Apple had been conspiring with book publishers to raise prices, which in turn would benefit the iPhone maker because of its 30% cut on revenue from the iBookstore. The move was also intended to thwart Amazon, which had been selling many best-selling e-books for only $9.99, which was likely below cost. Amazon has always offered affordable media to push its Kindle lineup of devices.
* Here is our coverage of the lawsuit over the last two-plus years.
* Apple still plans to appeal a decision handed down by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who ruled against the Cupertino-based company in a non-jury trial.
