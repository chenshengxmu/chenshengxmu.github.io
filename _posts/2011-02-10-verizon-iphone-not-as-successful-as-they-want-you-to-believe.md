title: Verizon iPhone Not as Successful as They Want You to Believe
---
* Last week, Verizon started taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4 and issued a press release later on, highlighting how this pre-order day was the best day ever in terms of sales for Verizon. Because the press release didn’t mention any number of units sold, I called BS on it and speculated that sales were probably much smaller than expected.
* Today is the big day for Verizon. It’s the first day where anyone and everyone can walk in a store (Apple, Verizon, Walmart, etc) and go home with a brand new Verizon iPhone. So I decided to jump in my car and go to the Apple Store and Verizon Store near me to see how they were doing. I expected 10 people or less at each store, but it seems I was too optimistic…
* This first image is from my local Apple Store and was taken at about 7.50 am. As you can tell, there isn’t much activity in there. As a matter of fact, there was 0 activity in there. Not one customer.

* This is my local Verizon Store, at about 7.55 am. There was much more customers in this store than at Apple’s. Actually, I counted 3 customers in there who were only here for the iPhone. I tried to get in to have a little chat with the 15+ bored Verizon employees standing in there, but they wouldn’t let me in because I wasn’t here to buy an iPhone 4. Ok!
* The funny part is that, as you can see, they blocked parking spaces in order to form a line. No need to say they didn’t have to do that.

* While Verizon can easily hide the truth about sales amount in a press release, it’s going to be tough to pretend their stores were packed today. The iPhone 4 is an eight-month old product. It doesn’t take a marketing expert to figure out it’s not going to generate as much infatuation as the iPhone can get on launch day.
* We’ll see what Verizon has to say about it as I’m sure they’ll come up with some well crafted press release touting the “incredible enthusiasm” the iPhone 4 generated for them.
* For what it’s worth, these were only two stores in my city and are definitely not representative of the general sales trend. But I do remember AT&T and Apple Stores being packed for days when the iPhone 4 came out 8 months ago, which gives us a starting point of comparison.
