* Apple today launched a redesigned Photos web app at iCloud.com/#photos following a period of testing when the software was available to beta testers via beta.icloud.com. The app runs in a web browser and sports several improvements to make it behave more like its desktop counterpart, such as a brand new sidebar on the left and a handy thumbnail scrubber when viewing an image.
* The new sidebar, seen below, gives you one-click access to all your albums and folders. Previously, Photos on iCloud.com put albums in a tab bar at the top. If you’re using iCloud Photo Library, all the images you take on your iOS device are pushed to iCloud and then to all your other devices, as well as to Photos at iCloud.com.

* The thumbnail scrubber can be seen top of post.
* It appears when you click an image to view it, like in Photos for iOS and Photos for Mac, allowing you to quickly select another image without needing to get back to the grid of photo thumbnails. Other enhancements include new action buttons for adding, uploading, adding, downloading, sharing and deleting albums and photos.
* Advanced desktop features like facial, object and scene recognition, Memories, shared albums and more are currently unavailable through Photos on iCloud.com.
