* We reported a few days ago on a developing story about the Verizon iPad 2. It seemed as though some iPad models, with the Verizon 3G service built in, have been having issues connecting to Verizon’s network.
* If you are one of the ones suffering from the problematic tablet, perk up. Popular tech site BGR has gotten their hands on the latest version of iOS, and has some great news for Verizon iPad users.
* One of our Apple sources has just let us know that Apple’s iOS 4.3.2, due within the next week or so, will fix the issues we’ve been hearing about with some Verizon iPad 2 models.
* The site goes on to say that the new update should also fix a couple of FaceTime and WebKit vulnerabilities. But the good news is, it sounds like a fix is on the way for all of the folks struggling with 3G connectivity woes.
* What I’m wondering is if an iPad 2 jailbreak is on the way, will Comex and participating parties wait until after 4.3.2 goes live before releasing anything?
* If you remember Comex had previously found an exploit for the iPad 2, but the glitch was patched by Apple in the iOS 4.3.1 update. We will let you know as soon as we have more information.
* Hopefully this doesn’t delay the iPad 2 jailbreak anymore than it already is, what do you think?
