* Well, it didn’t take long for Google to remove its new Gmail app for iOS from the App Store. Just about 3 hours after it was first available, it is now nowhere to be found.
* If you try to download the app right now, you’ll be greeted with an error message telling you the item you requested is not currently available in the US Store. If you’ve already downloaded and tried to use the Gmail app, it probably doesn’t come as a surprise to you that Google already took it down…
* Let’s be honest. The app is a disgrace. The first thing you see upon launching the app is an error message, then once you get passed that, you basically have nothing more than the Gmail web app wrapped in a decent-looking UI. No push notifications, no support for multiple accounts, etc.
* You’d think that Google would know better by now. They know that every Apple blog out there is waiting for them, yet they decide to release a half-baked product.
* Google will probably “fix” some of the issues of the app and resubmit to Apple soon, but realistically, what they should do is throw it all out and start again from scratch.
