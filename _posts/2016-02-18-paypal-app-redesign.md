* The PayPal app for iOS, which has been long over-due for an update, has finally received its much-needed update on Thursday that adds official support for the retina HD displays of Apple’s 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets.
* The app, which is still a free download from the App Store, has been completely redesigned with a slew of changes to make using the app not only feel better, but look better.
* Anyone who follows me on Twitter knows that I have been ranting for well over a year for retina HD support for the PayPal app. It’s the only app I had left that still looked all balloony and fuzzy as if the app belonged on a Nintendo 64, so today’s update (version 6.0.0), which officially adds retina HD display support, is a big step in my opinion in bringing PayPal’s mobile app up to speed with modern times.
* The redesigned app is a completely different experience for users. Rather than seeing a black and white list of transactions of both your outgoing and incoming payments, the app is now far more colorful and provides a brand-new home page with easy-to-access options right at your fingertips.
* The shortcuts from the home page allow you to quickly perform the most common functions from the PayPal app; these include:
* When looking at your recent PayPal activity, you will also notice that the PayPal app now supports profile pictures. The pictures are rounded like they are throughout iOS, and anyone who sets an image for their PayPal account that you’ve done any business with will now appear to the left of their names in your payments.

* It’s also useful that there are two easy buttons for sorting your transactions between money in, and money out, which will help you filter through where your money is going and where it’s coming from. Notably, the mobile app’s account activity screen is now able to show you up to three years of your payment history as of today’s update.
* When you tap on your PayPal balance, you get shortcuts to adding money to your PayPal account, and transferring money to any of your linked bank accounts.
* Yes PayPal users, this is the app update we’ve been waiting for. If you’re already using the app, you just need to head over to the Updates tab in the App Store and you can start downloading the update immediately. Otherwise, you can head over to the App Store to download the app for free.
