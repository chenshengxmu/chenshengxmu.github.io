* The PwnageTool jailbreak for iPhone iOS 4.1 is out and available for download! It was supposed to be released last Sunday but it didn’t for unknown reasons. This new version of PwnageTool will jailbreak the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and iPhone 4. PwnageTool will also work for the iPod Touch 3G and 4G. Additionally, it will work with the iPad and the new Apple TV.
* LimeRa1n and GreenPois0n have been released over a week ago. The difference between these jailbreaks and PwnageTool is that PwnageTool will preserve your baseband. This is crucial for iPhone owners who want to unlock…
* PwnageTool is Mac only. It will allow you to cook a custom firmware to restore your iPhone to. You can download PwnageTool from our download section.
* A PwnageTool tutorial is now available.
