* It looks like a lot of our forecasts are materializing today, including the iPad 2 sticking around. We figured we’d see Apple continue to sell last year’s tablet after today, with a bit of a price drop to appeal to a wider audience.
* And that’s exactly what it’s doing. Apple just announced that it will be keeping the iPad 2 around for folks that aren’t impressed with the new slate’s features starting at just $399…
* Apple has dropped the entry-level price on its iPad 2 from $499 to $399. That’s for the 16GB Wi-Fi only model. And it looks like it is going to continue selling the Wi-Fi + 3G version as well for $529 — which is also a $100 cheaper that before.
* The strategy makes since considering the success Apple has seen with selling its iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S side-by-side to cover more of the market. The $399 price point will appeal to a lot of folks, including schools who are looking to take advantage of Apple’s new digital textbooks.
* The price could also entice consumers who are on the fence between a cheaper tablet, like Amazon’s Kindle Fire, and the iPad, as the difference between the two is now less than $200.
