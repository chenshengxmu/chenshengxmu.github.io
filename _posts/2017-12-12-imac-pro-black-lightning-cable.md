* Apple is on track to launch this Thursday the fastest Mac they’ve built to date, the all-new $4,999 iMac Pro, and already hands-on YouTube videos are popping up all over the place.
* Popular YouTuber Marques Brownlee noted in his initial hands-on with the new iMac Pro that the all-in-one desktop computer ships with a special black-clad USB-A to Lightning cable from Apple for charging lithium-ion batteries powering the wireless keyboard, trackpad and mouse.
* This is a nice touch considering that the computer’s unibody enclosure and the enclosures of the included Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad 2 and Magic Mouse 2 are for the first time in Space Gray rather than in Apple’s standard Silver aluminum finish for Macs.
* You don’t need me to tell you that Apple Lightning cables have always been white.
* As you know, Apple has never offered a black-clad Lightning cable on its website.
* What I’d like to know is if that’s an exclusive perk limited to iMac Pro customers or whether the company might be actually planning to make that cable available to purchase standalone.
* I always purchase my iOS devices in either Black or Space Gray finish. Like many folks, I’ve always hated that iPhones ship with a white Lightning cable no matter the finish (black Lightning cables are, of course, readily available from third-party manufacturers).

* Imagine finding a color-matched Lightning cable in the iOS device box: if you buy an iPhone X in Silver, you get a white Lightning cable; or, opt for a Space Gray handset and the phone arrives with an all-black cable in the box.
* For now, if you really, really need a black Lightning cable from Apple to sync and charge your iOS devices and Magic accessories, you’ll need to buy a $5,000 iMac Pro.
* Should Apple offer black Lighting cables separately for sale?
* Sound off in the comments!
