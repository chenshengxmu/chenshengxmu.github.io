* Apple tried to give users at least some photo and video editing tools for use on the mobile platform, but even those options built into the Photos app that let you fiddle with cropping, resizing, rotation, and colorization are limited and leave a lot to be desired. Not to mention, the features that Apple does give you are difficult to use with precision and are even cumbersome to use at times.
* With an app called Desqueeze, you can resize photos and videos in bulk with ease, and not only that, the application gives you incredible precision for doing it. A step up from what Apple calls built-in editing features in iOS, Desqueeze is a great option for those looking to make their photos and/or videos smaller in file size, change their format, and more. In this tutorial, we’ll be showing you how you can use the application to resize your photos and videos.
* In this tutorial, we’ll focus on resizing images.

* To begin resizing photos in Desqueeze, you’ll want to follow these steps:
* Step 1: Download Desqueeze for free, launch the app, and tap on the photo(s) in your Camera Roll you want to work with to select it.
* Step 2: Select the scaling ratio you want to use for your photo(s) by tapping on it.
* Step 3: Once you’ve chosen all the photo(s) you want to work with, tap on the editing button at the bottom left of the app.
* Note: You will now be greeted with all your editing options. Any changes you make here will be applied to all of the photos you selected when you apply them, even if you chose more than one photo.

* Step 4: Tap on the dimensions box as outlined above and you’ll get a dimension input box where you can choose your own custom dimensions for scaling.

* Step 5: Type in the custom width and height you want and then tap “OK.”
* Step 6: Tap “OK” again in the next interface you see.
* Step 7: Now that your dimensional settings are saved, tap on the paw button at the bottom of the application to initiate the changes.

* Step 8: A new interface appears, showing you a history of all your resized photos that have been added to your Camera Roll.

* Note: From here, you can select one or more of your results and you can share or delete them. The share button is found at the top, right-hand corner of the app, and the delete button is found at the bottom, left-hand corner of the app. All results that show up in this window are already present in your Camera Roll because the application automatically saves a copy of the edited photo to your Camera Roll when you apply the changes.

* Picking up where Step 3 left off above, you can also pick from image resizing presets rather than inserting your own numbers, which is especially useful if you’re not very photo editing-savvy and want the device to do the scaling math for you so that your image doesn’t come out scaled weird by way of poor scaling numbers. To do this, follow these steps after Step 3 above:
* Step 1: Swipe to the left on the editing options interface and you’ll be provided with all of the above scaling presets.
* Step 2: Tap on one of the desired presets and then tap on the “OK” button to save it.
* Step 3: Tap “OK” again in the editing options interface after verifying that the dimensions are the same as the ones you chose.
* Step 4: Tap on the paw button at the bottom of the application, just like you would have in Step 7 above, and your scaled image will be saved to the Camera Roll.

* Just like photos, Desqueeze comes with the same options for videos in your Camera Roll, although you’ll find that there are new file types to choose from and a few other different parameters, considering that video files are different than image files.
* We’ll keep this simple. Here are the steps for resizing your videos from your Camera Roll:
* Step 1: Launch Desqueeze and select the video(s) from your Camera Roll that you want to work with.
* Step 2: After selecting, tap on the editing button at the bottom right of the app.
* Step 3: Enter your own manual dimensions, or swipe to the left to choose a preset, then pick the ratio you want.
* Step 4: Tap “OK” twice.
* Step 5: If you’re satisfied with the dimension and scaling settings, tap on the paw button at the bottom of the app to save the resized video(s) to your Camera Roll.

* Desqueeze is a free download from the App Store and it comes with numerous tools in its compact interface. The app will let you select one or more photo(s) from your Camera Roll, and then you can begin choosing from all of the editing options you want to use that are provided by the app.
* Although Desqueeze will resize photos and videos in your Camera Roll, it doesn’t modify the original media, it just makes a copy. You’ll want to either make quick use of the new smaller file before removing it or remove the original after you’re satisfied with the resizing because otherwise you’ll have two copies of the same media taking up valuable storage space on your iOS device.
* You can select photos and videos whether they’re in portrait or landscape orientation, and the application is smart enough to automatically resize the media in the proper orientation. For example – if you choose 1024 x 768 when selecting photos of different orientations, landscape photos will be scaled to 1024 pixels wide by 768 pixels long, and portrait photos will be scaled to 768 pixels wide by 1024 pixels long.
* What’s more is the app also includes various tools for converting file types. For images, .png, .jpg, and .tiff are available for converting to, while for videos, .mp4, .mov, and .m4v are available for converting to. These options give you a good way to prepare images for printer, web, or digital viewing use, and ensure that video is always in the highest quality that you demand.
* One of the biggest benefits you’ll find in resizing your media to smaller dimensions is that you’ll reduce the file sizes. This means increasing the amount of media that can be stored on your device, making internet uploads faster on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites, and even making sharing photos via iMessage or SMS faster.
* With cloud storage often being limited and additional space often costing the user more money, conserving space is always a great benefit, and when photos are so pixel-plentiful with today’s high-megapixel cameras, it doesn’t really hurt to scale them down at times.
* When Apple’s settings aren’t fine-tuned enough, the free-to-download Desqueeze app offers a great way to break down the actual numbers and get the dimensions that you truly want. iOS’ built-in photo editing options are made to be simple to use and what you get is a dumbed-down interface with fewer fine-grained controls. With Desqueeze, you’ll fill the void that Apple didn’t fill when they launched some of these features in the Photos app.
