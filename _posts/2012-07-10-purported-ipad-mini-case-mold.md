* Hot on the heels of the iPhone 5 engineering samples we saw earlier today, comes new photos showing what is claimed to be a case mold for Apple’s rumored iPad Mini.
* The images surface in the midst of tons of ongoing speculation that the Cupertino company is set to unveil a smaller iPad this year, to help it expand its popular tablet line..

* The images come from GottaBeMobile, who also happens to be responsible for the earlier iPhone report.
* “Exclusive photos of an iPad Mini engineering sample provide a first look at the iPad Mini design and hints at possible iPad Mini features. The new iPad will be the thinnest Apple tablet yet, as one of the photos shows.
* Photos of the iPad Mini engineering sample come from a trust source inside the Apple supply chain.”
* Interestingly enough, the case mold in these images falls in line with a number of previous reports regarding the rumored device. Last week, Macotakara reported that Apple was preparing production of a smaller iPad that is “almost as thin as an iPod touch.”
* Also of note is the fact that the hole for the dock connector in the mold appears to be the revamped 19-pin dock connector that is expected to turn up in this year’s iPhone. It makes sense that Apple would want to implement the new port across all future devices.
* Obviously, there’s no way for us to confirm the legitimacy of the above photos. But we have to admit, they are interesting, given the amount of recent iPad Mini chatter.
* Thoughts?
