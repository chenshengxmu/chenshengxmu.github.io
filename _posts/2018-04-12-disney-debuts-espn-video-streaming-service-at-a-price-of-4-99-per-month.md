* The entertainment conglomerate Disney today launched ESPN+, its new video-streaming service with 10,000 live sporting events in its first year, including more than 180 Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games.
* The service rolled out at a price of $4.99 per month, with annual subscriptions available for $44.99 per year. Aside from live events, ESPN+ provides an on-demand library of content and exclusive programming unavailable on the network’s linear channels.
* Videos are streamed in high definition at a silky smooth sixty frames per second.
* Subscribers get “a differentiated advertising experience” without display ads and no pre-roll ads within videos. Limited advertising remains in the natural ad breaks of live sports content.
* There are also thousands of college sports events, ranging from 20 different athletic conferences across the country and other live sports include rugby, cricket, boxing, tennis and golf. There’s also built-in DVR function so fans can record sporting events to watch later.
