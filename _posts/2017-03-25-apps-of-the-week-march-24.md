* Looking to pass the time this weekend with some new apps and games? iDB has you covered. The latest edition of our Apps of the Week roundup includes a message scheduler, a dating app with a twist, an app for discovering fun stuff to do around you, and of course some new games for you to check out.

* Never forget to stay in touch with the people that matter to you, with Scheduled. The app allows you to schedule messages and set reminders, and it’s compatible with iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter and Calling. How does it work? Well you just schedule your message, the app sends you an alert to remind you of the message, and then it sends it. I’m sure there are similar apps out there, but I like the UI design and third-party app support. Scheduled is available for free.

* Looking to add a little mystery and competition to your dating life? Splish turns dating into a fun, fast and phenomenally addicting game. Playing is simple: Choose questions from the Question Bank. Watch contestants from the Dating Pool join your game. And when someone posts the perfect answers to your questions, chat and connect using one of Splish’s witty icebreakers. Play the perfect game, and you just might meet your perfect match. Splish is available for free.

* Tired of the same old boring routine? Looking for something new and fun to do? Meet Yaknak. This app allows you to quickly discover popular places and deals within a short walk of where you are, simply by swiping. See only popular, fun things within a 15 minute walk of your current location, swipe left on the ones you don’t like, swipe right when you find one you do. Again, I believe there are already apps like this available, but this one definitely seems worth checking out. Yaknak is available for free.

* Paper Wings is a fast-paced arcade game about catching falling balls mid-air to keep your bird alive. As you gain points, you advance through the stages in the game. In each stage, new challenges are introduced to make the game harder and more fun. Simply guide your origami bird in the air, collect as many coins as possible and avoid the hazards. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is addicting. Paper Wings is available for free.

You move through the deck as a stealthy thief, sneaking in the shadows, extinguishing torches, pickpocket guards and steal valuable treasures without getting caught. The game offers an accessible core gameplay with a deep layer of tactical planning and various risk reward mechanics on top. In 4 different heists, you can test your skills against various enemy and trap types. Card Thief is available for $1.99.
