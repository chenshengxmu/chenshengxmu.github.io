* Prolific leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer today posted claimed images of a purported case for Apple’s unreleased iPhone 7 on Twitter.
* While not the first iPhone 7 case, this one is pretty interesting as it seemingly corroborates that the handset will in fact ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack while adopting a dual-camera setup on the back and stereo speakers.
* Apple is expected to formally announce the iPhone 7, the next major upgrade to its smartphone lineup, in September.
* It should be noted that case vendors sometimes base their accessories on rumors alone in an effort to be first out of the gate with a case when the new handset arrives. As such, these leaks should be taken with a grain of salt.
* If these photographs represent a genuine iPhone 7 case, Apple’s next smartphone should have a similar rounded design with a flat back like the current iPhone 6/6s series. The two speaker grilles at the bottom suggest that the iPhone 7 will have stereo speakers, as previously suspected.
* As you can see for yourself, there’s no hole for the headphone jack as the iPhone 7 is said to drop the standard 3.5mm audio connector in favor of wired Lightning-enabled headphones and wireless Bluetooth headsets.
* The size of the hole for the rear camera suggests that this particular case maker is buying into the rumor that the iPhone 7 will feature a dual-camera setup on the back. On the other hand, it could be a design choice on part of the case maker as the hole could accommodate standard rear lens along with a LED flash module.

* The reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara reiterated recently that the iPhone 7 will include a thinner Lightning port, stereo speakers, a rear camera that’s flush with the housing and no antenna bands on the back.
