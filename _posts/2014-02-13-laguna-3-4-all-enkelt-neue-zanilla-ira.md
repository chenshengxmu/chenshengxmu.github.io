* Welcome to the third edition of our Theme Thursday roundup, which highlights some of the best theme releases for Winterboard each week. While this column is primarily focused on iPhone and iPod touch themes, many of them are also compatible with the iPad. We also often mention some worthwhile alternatives to consider looking into. The themes featured this week are: Laguna, 3 4 All, Enkelt Neue, Zanilla 2.1 and iRa. I’m also using ClassicDock and Iconomatic throughout. Take a look…

* It is not often that I come across a theme that is as close to perfection as Laguna 3 by minhtrimatrix. The theme features custom icons that are designed with incredible detail, and the overall color palette is bright and refreshing. Additionally, the theme customizes the Status Bar, Lock screen and Phone app keypads, system toggle switches and some other minor elements. We’ve been stressing the challenges that iOS 7 presents for designers, and this theme is proof that designers are beginning to get past those hurdles. Laguna 3 is $2.99 on the Cydia Store for iPhone and iPad.

* The third installment in a popular theme series, 3 4 All provides well-designed custom icon masks for all stock and many third-party apps. The theme, designed by Luke Voysey (Sk37ch), has a darker color scheme consisting of various black, grey and navy blue shades. As you could guess, that means most non-themed icons do not contrast well with this theme. As such, you will have to hold out for future updates or create your own using the designer’s upcoming PSD guide. 3 4 All is free on Cydia in the ModMyi repo for iPhone and iPad.

* Simpler and better. It’s the tagline for Enkelt Neue, a new theme that features over 200 custom icons, a new Lock screen camera icon, full compatibility with FlipControlCenter and custom message skins. What I like best about this theme is that the icons are more consistent than Apple’s stock set, with countered edges for added depth. The chat bubbles in Messages and biteSMS are given a more squared off appearance. Enkelt Neue, designed by Marc Bouchenoire, is $2.99 on the Cydia Store.

* We previously covered Zanilla in our roundup of the best Winterboard themes, but it has since received an update that merits attention. The 90-plus custom icons now have a rounder appearance, while retaining drop shadows, and look much improved overall. Better yet, designer Kogulan Sivaneshan has added Zanilla 2.1 to Cydia in the default BigBoss repository. Free and iPhone only.

* iRa is supposed to be a play on the words innovation and era. Looking past nomenclature, we’ve got quite a nice theme here. iRa includes over 100 custom icons with a flat appearance, and designer ihkltc is taking requests for more. You also get a custom Status Bar and a few other tweaked elements. iRa is available now for 99 cents on Cydia in the MacCiti repository.
* Thank you to the readers that recommended some of the themes shown above.
