* As noted by some of our readers, Apple has quietly posted a new video to its iPhone 5 page entitled “The Launch Day video.” The two-minute compilation clip, as you might have guessed, shows scenes from Apple Stores around the globe during last month’s iPhone 5 launch day events…
* You can find the video on Apple’s iPhone 5 page by clicking here, as it’s yet to add it to its YouTube channel. However, several ripped versions have appeared online. So here you go:
* It doesn’t look like Apple intended this to be an advertisement, though it would certainly make a great one. It really conveys the type of power Apple and its products have with consumers.
* The company has actually been scoffed at over these types of exuberant events, but they seem to be working. Apple sold a record-breaking 5 million iPhone 5s in its opening weekend.
* Apple launched the iPhone 5 in 9 countries, and it’s now in more than 30. It plans to add to that on November 2nd, and should have the handset in more than 100 countries by December.
* Anyway, what’d you think of the compilation clip?
