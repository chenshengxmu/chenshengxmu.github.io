* Thus far, we’ve heard conflicting rumors regarding the next iPhone’s speaker setup, with some sources being adamant that the handset would arrive outfitted with stereo speakers and others shaking their head in disagreement, suggesting the iPhone 7 would have the plain old single-speaker setup, like prior models.
* Well, how about four speakers?
* Prolific leaker Steven Hemmerstoffer today posted on his French-language blog NowhereElse.fr a set images of images of an alleged iPhone 7 prototype case which shows not one, not two, not three but four speakers, two at the top top and an additional two at the bottom.
* The image top of post was apparently taken from a promotional video made by an Italian case maker which obtained this prototype case in anticipation of the upcoming iPhone 7 refresh. The wider camera lens hole, notably decreased protrusion and no horizontal antenna lines are all consistent with recent leaks.
* As you can see for yourself, the rear case also shows a stacked camera and LED flash package setup, now pretty oddly aligned across the vertical axis in the upper left corner as opposed to horizontal alignment like on all current iPhones.
* There’s no telling with certainty if this prototype case is the real deal.
* Other iPhone 7 rumors have suggested that the handset may ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack, sportthe iPad Pro’s Smart Connector and have a widely-rumored dual-lens camera setup for improved low light performance, better light sensitivity and the ability to adjust focus after the image has been taken, among other rumored features.
* What do you make of these images?
* Would the iPhone 7 benefit from a four-speaker setup, do you think?
* Chime in with your observations in the comment section.
