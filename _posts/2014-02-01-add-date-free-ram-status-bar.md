* How many times have you asked yourself “how can I add today’s date as well as free RAM info in my Status Bar?” If you’re anything like me, it would be about zero time. But let’s me honest, we aren’t all looking for the exact same things, and chances are you may be looking for such a tweak.
* If that is the case, then let me introduce you to StatusModifier, a jailbreak tweak by Firemoon777 that was released earlier last month on Cydia. The tweak, as the name suggests, lets you modify parts of your Status Bar by hiding items, but also by letting you add the date and free RAM info…
* I came across StatusModifier a couple of weeks ago as I was looking for a tweak to hide the carrier info from my Status Bar. As it turns out, StatusModifier can do that, and much more.
* While not as thorough as Springtomize 3, StatusModifier still lets you hide a bunch of items from your Status Bar such as the time, signal bars, carrier, etc… This is what I initially used StatusModifier for, but those of you who like to take their tweaking one notch up might like to have the freedom to add custom date and free RAM available in the Status Bar as well.
* StatusModifier comes with a date format builder that allows you to add info to the Status Bar on the fly. You can easily add seconds, the day of the week, the month, the year and free RAM info from an easy to use builder, straight from the Settings app. A slider is also available to let you adjust the refresh rate of the available memory info.

* StatusModifier is a fairly solid tweak if that is what you’re looking for. I particularly appreciated that no respring was necessary when adding items to the Status Bar (although you must respring if you want to hide items such as carrier name). I also liked the fact that I was able to display the date in the format of my choice, thanks to the handy builder.
* StatusModifier is completely free on the ModMyI repo. If that’s something you’d be interested in, make sure to give it a try. Note that another app named StatusTime+ was recently released in Cydia. While I didn’t try it, it appears to me it only lets you customize the time.
