* Apple CEO Tim Cook will open the annual All Things Digital technology conference, which takes place from May 29-31, 2012 at the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
* Apple’s chief executive will kickstart the technology conference that celebrates its tenth year. As in years past, this year D10 will host a bunch of Silicon Valley luminaries, including Oracle founder and CEO Larry Ellison, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek and Skype CEO Tony Bates…
* The news has been confirmed by Kara Swisher over at the AllThingsD blog, which is run by the Wall Street Journal network that also organizes the D10 conference.
* Walt Mossberg and I could not be more thrilled to announce that Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, will be the opening-night speaker at our 10th D: All Things Digital conference.
* It will be Cook’s first appearance at the D conference and his first time onstage at a non-Apple event.
* Other Silicon Valley executives and VIPs have also been confirmed as speakers, including Oracle founder and CEO Larry Ellison, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek, Skype CEO Tony Bates, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios president Dr. Ed Catmull, LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffman, Federal Trade Commission chairman Jon Leibowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mary Meeker, Intellectual Ventures founder and CEO Nathan Myhrvold, Visa president John Partridge and Zynga founder and CEO Mark Pincus.
* iDownloadBlog will be providing remote live coverage of the D10 conference to bring you related news as it happens.
* Produced each year by the Wall Street Journal technology columnist Walt Mossberg and his sidekick Kara Swisher, the D conference “brings together the people who are shaping the way we work, play, communicate and live”.
* Steve Jobs sat for a fireside chat with Swisher and Mossberg at the D8 conference in 2010 to talk Flash, iPad and Apple’s growing rivalry with Google. Here’s a quick segment where Jobs talks Apple’s war on Flash.
* I think this particular segment is especially telling today as Adobe recently dropped Flash support for mobile to concentrate on HTML5. From today’s perspective, that’s exactly how Jobs hinted things would play out (he called Flash a technology in its descendancy).
* The full Jobs video is available as a free iTunes podcast.
* Jobs also appeared alongside Microsoft’s Bill Gates at the D5 conference in 2007 (free podcast here).
* Are you “thrilled” as well that Cook will be headlining D10? Surely it’s an honor that they chose Apple’s boss to kickstart the conference.
