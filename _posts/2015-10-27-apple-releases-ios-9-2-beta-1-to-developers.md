* Apple has released the first beta for iOS 9.2. The beta, which is accessible via Apple’s developer center, comes in at build 13C5055d.
* Unlike some of Apple’s more recent beta releases, iOS 9.2 beta 1 includes iOS SDK Release Notes! This beta release is focused primarily on the new iOS 9 technology, Safari View Controller, making it more like standalone Safari. Check out the rest of this post to see what the new beta includes.
* Safari View Controller is the new technology in iOS 9 that allows apps to invoke an in-app browser based on Safari, instead of forcing developers to deploy their own custom browsers whenever an app needs to invoke a web view.
* For the end user, Safari View Controller brings about numerous benefits, including being able to access already saved logins, access iCloud Keychain, and autofill items. It’s basically a mini-Safari browser that you can call directly from any app that supports it.
* In iOS 9.2 beta 1, Safari View Controller is now more closely aligned with Safari proper. It can now access the reload menu to reload pages without content blockers, and request the desktop version of websites. Perhaps even more important, is the new ability to access 3rd party extensions via Safari View Controller web pages.
* This is a great update that will have a real impact on user’s workflows. Unfortunately I’m not able to test it out right now, because I’m away from the office, but I look forward to demonstrating it for you soon.
