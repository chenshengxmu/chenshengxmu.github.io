* Depending on the type of iPhone or iPad you have, you might be able to change your Camera app’s video settings to support better picture quality or to conserve storage space when recording. But sadly, Apple makes the process more convoluted than it needs to be.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called TapVideoConfig by iOS developer SpicaT simplifies the process by letting you change your iPhone’s video recording quality from directly within the stock Camera app itself.
* The tweak transforms the video recording quality indicator at the top right of the Camera app into a functional button. After tapping on it, video recording quality selection menu appears front and center, as shown above.
* In this case, the handset supports recording 4K video at 30FPS, 720p video at 30FPS, and 1080p video at 30FPS, but your results may vary depending on the device you have. Just tapping on any of the options changes the video recording quality on the fly.
* TapVideoConfig replaces Apple’s convoluted process of navigating to Settings → Photos & Camera → Record Video to choose a different video recording quality, and it makes much quicker work of this task.
* If you happen to record a lot of video from your iPhone and suffer from limited storage space or experiment with video quality frequently, then you may want to consider trying TapVideoConfig for your needs.
* The tweak is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices.
* Do you think TapVideoConfig makes the process of changing your video recording quality easier? Discuss below!
