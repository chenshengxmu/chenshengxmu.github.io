* AT&T’s big announcement got lost somewhere in the cracks of the onslaught of WWDC news yesterday. The carrier launched a new iPhone app this weekend that brings enhanced push-to-talk (EPTT) to the popular handset.
* The app, which is aptly named AT&T Enhanced Push-To-Talk, allows iPhone 4S and 5 users to communicate quickly using next-generation VoIP technology to deliver one-to-one or group calls over AT&T’s 3G and 4G networks…
* From the App Store description:
* Key features of Enhanced PTT include: * Fast call setup times and low latency * Advanced push-to-talk features including real-time presence, Instant Personal Alerts, free/busy status and Supervisory Override * Scalable to support large contact lists and talk groups * Organizations can use a Corporate Admin Tool for easy management of users and groups
* Previously, AT&T offered a PTT App for Android, but it only worked on a few devices. But with Sprint on the verge of closing down its Nextel network, which offers a similar feature, AT&T figured they’d go after iPhone users too.
* Of course, third party apps like Voxer have been doing PTT on the iPhone for quite some time now. But AT&T says that it’s the first carrier to offer the service on the handset, and it believes its features and integration will set it apart.
* For what it’s worth, I played around in the app for a bit and didn’t notice anything special. But if you’re looking for an iPhone PTT solution, it’s worth checking out. You can find AT&T Enhanced Push-To-Talk in the App Store for free.
