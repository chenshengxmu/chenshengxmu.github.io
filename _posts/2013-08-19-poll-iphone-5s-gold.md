* Everyone is complaining about Apple’s rumored iPhone 5S allegedly being offered in gold / champagne color, but something tells me it’s going to be hugely popular with guys who like to show off and the types who were offended by Samsung’s ads and now want to let the world know they have a new iPhone.
* But what about the others? Can you stomach the very though of the gold/champagne iPhone 5S?
* Undecided people are probably keeping their fingers crossed that leaked images don’t look nearly as good as the real thing. Can you picture a gold iPhone variant at all in your mind? More importantly, if the iPhone 5S will be indeed offered in several color choices, will you be buying the gold/champagne model?

* Poll: are you going to buy your iPhone 5S in gold/champagne color? I’m not decided yet. I’ll have to see the other colors first before making up my mind.
* Generally speaking, I’d have no problem wearing a Kardashian iPhone on my person. Speaking of which, the gold/champagne iPhone 5S should be a huge hit with women – it has a certain unmistakable supermodel quality to it, no?
