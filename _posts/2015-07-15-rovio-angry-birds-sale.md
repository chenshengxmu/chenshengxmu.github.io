* Do you still care about Angry Birds? I myself think the series has run its course but am nonetheless eager to fling a few birds every now and then as I continue to find these physics-based games pretty darn addictive and charming. Developer Rovio has now put a number of Angry Birds titles on sale in the App Store and some of them have gone free for the first time in a long time.
* Grab them all now and your kids will thank you later!
* Angry Birds Space, Angry Birds Space HD, Angry Birds Birds HD and Angry Birds Star Wars HD have dropped to their lowest prices we’ve seen in quite a while.
* Here are the download links:
* If you grab all five games now, you’ll spend just three bucks versus a combined value of thirteen bucks before the discount.
* Angry Birds Space for iPhone is particularly interesting as it’s gone free for the first time on the App Store since a brief one-day free deal in May of 2013.
* Featuring more than 300 levels with a low gravity twist to them, in addition to hidden levels, daily missions, a bunch of colorful playable characters and other perks, Angry Birds Space for iPhone is a no brainer.
* If you can’t stand Angry Birds any longer, check out Apple’s Free App of the Week, Card Wars – Adventure Time Card Game by Cartoon Networks.
* IGN is also offering Bloons Tower Defense 5 at no charge, a tower defense game which otherwise costs a total of eight bucks for separate iPhone and iPad editions.
* Not interested in games?
* Then pick up Pixelmator for iOS for just 99 cents, the first time we’ve seen this powerful image editing app for the iPhone and iPad receive such a deep discount.
