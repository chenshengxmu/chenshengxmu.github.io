* The Indian government last week announced a 50% tax hike on imported smartphones in a bid to boost domestic manufacturing. As a result, Apple has now increased the price of every iPhone model it sells in the country except the locally made iPhone SE.
* Reuters reported Monday that the latest iPhone X is now priced at 105,720 rupees for a 256-gigabyte variant (an average increase of 3.6 percent), which works out to approximately $1,646. Apple’s India website also lists a 256-gigabyte variant of the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 with a 3.6 percent higher price point at 79,420 rupees, or about $1,237.

* By comparison, the full price of the 64GB iPhone X in the United States is $999, with the 256GB variant costing $1,149. The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 with 256 gigabytes of storage cost $849.
* The price of Apple’s locally-assembled iPhone SE model has remained intact.
* Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government last week raised the customs duty on phones from 10% to 15%. This new hike price probably won’t bode well for Apple’s smartphone market share in the populous country that currently sits at about three percent.
