* Sebastien reviewed the Mobile Cloth last year, and he was right in calling it a “no-brainer” for iPhone and iPad users. The Mobile Cloth is the most effective and affordable screen cleaning cloth out there, and we at iDB use Mobile Cloths to clean our own tech.
* The folks at Mobile Cloth have launched their latest cleaning weapon for the iPhone and iPad, and it’s called the MC Nano. It works exactly like the Mobile Cloth classic, but the MC Nano is a smaller cloth that easily fits in your pocket, backpack, or iPad case.
* Guess what? We’re giving away 25 MC Nano packs!

* That’s right, 25 lucky iDB readers will receive their very own MC Nano 2pack!! That means you’ll actually get two MC Nano cloths in one package.
* “MOBiLE CLOTH is made of a unique high tech material consisting of microfibers 100 times thinner than a human hair! It is woven into a special pattern which we call “nubs”. Each nub acts like hundreds of tiny suction cups to pull fingerprints smudges, and all kinds of other junk away from the surface of your device and into the cloth with one or two swipes. No water or cleaning solution is needed.”
* The MC Nano will clean your iPhone or iPad’s screen just like its bigger brother, but the MC Nano’s 4 x 4 dimensions make it a much more portable utility. The Mobile Cloth is made of a special material that makes it incredibly efficient at cleaning smudges and dirt off a device’s screen, and we at iDB have been using Mobile Cloths on all our tech (iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.) for months. Once you go Mobile Cloth, you don’t go back.
* We’ll be contacting the 25 MC Nano giveaway winners in the next couple days via Twitter direct message. Again, you must have ‘liked’ us on Facebook and followed us on Twitter to be considered. Winners will be selected randomly. However, you can increase your chances of winning by leaving a funny/witty comment below with why you need the MC Nano in your life. Make sure to include your Twitter handle.
* Also, this giveaway is open to all of our international readers! It doesn’t matter where you are in the world— enter to see if you win!
* Good luck! And a big thanks to John and the guys at Mobile Cloth for sponsoring this giveaway.
* UPDATE: Winners have been selected and contacted.
