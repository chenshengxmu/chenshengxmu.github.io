* When iOS 5.1 launched alongside Apple’s new iPad earlier this month, we saw three different jailbreak methods quickly surface. But it seems like the trail has since gone cold, as we haven’t heard any news on the jailbreak front in the past couple of weeks.
* That, however, changed this morning, as infamous iOS hacker pod2g finally gave us an update regarding the status of the iOS 5.1 jailbreak. And just as we expected, it looks like it’s going to be a while before we see a public release…
* About 5.1 jailbreak for A5+ devices : it’s not out and I have no clue when it’ll happen. I’m working some hours per week on finding vulns.

* But right now we (cdev) have some pieces of a userland jailbreak, but we miss some, and even if we had them all, there’s weeks of work…

* … to put them all together in a public ready tool.

* Keep in mind that this news only pertains to the iOS 5.1 jailbreak for A5+ devices. Other users may not have to wait quite that long. The A4 processor, as always, is susceptible to GeoHot’s Limera1n bootrom exploit. So it’s really just a matter of creating an untether for those devices.
* Regardless, if you haven’t updated to iOS 5.1 yet, we recommend that you stay away from it for now. Especially if you want to keep your [untethered] jailbreak. There just simply aren’t enough new features in 5.1 to justify losing all of your favorite tweaks and themes.
* Any questions?
