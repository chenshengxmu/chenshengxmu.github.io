* Siri has picked up the ability to instantly stream an appropriate daily news brief podcast when asked about what’s making news.
* Originally added to the iOS 11.2.5 beta, this useful new feature has since rolled out to non-beta users in the US, UK and Australia. Supported news sources include ABC, SBS and Seven Network in the US and BBC News in the UK, among others.
* To hear the latest news, say something like, “Hey Siri, play some news”, “Hey Siri, give me the news”, “Hey Siri, what’s the news today” or some such. This will stream a daily news podcast from NPR in the US and BBC News in the UK in the Podcast app, available free on App Store.

* If you don’t have the app installed, Siri will play whatever you were last listening to.
* You can ask for generic news from specific news sources, too—“Hey Siri, play some news from The Washington Post”—or for more specific business, sports or music news.
* To try out this feature, you must be running iOS 11.2, the iOS 11.2.5 beta or the current stable version of iOS, which is iOS 11.2.2.
* As mentioned, it doesn’t work when Siri is invoked manually by holding the Home or Side button because doing so will serve up your standard textual news headlines from Apple News or third-party web sources if Apple News is unavailable or not installed on the device.
* This capability is going to be supported on the upcoming HomePod speaker as well.
* Thanks, Carlos!
