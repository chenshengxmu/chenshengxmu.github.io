title: Pandora Update Includes Retina Display for iPhone
---
* For those of you who are like myself in the regard of not checking the App Store daily, the streaming sensation Pandora has updated its iPhone app.

* The largest feature implemented is the support for Retina Display. It does look nice.
* What’s New In This Version:
* I thought my usage of Pandora would greatly increase with the background capabilities, but I was mistaken. Perhaps it’s the lack of 3G in my area, which makes it’s functionality nearly unusable. Nevertheless, the update makes it look cleaner on my home-screen.
* How often do you use Pandora?
