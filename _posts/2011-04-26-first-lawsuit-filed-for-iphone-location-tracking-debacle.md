* I had a feeling this was coming. The very first lawsuit has been filed against Apple for the highly controversial tracking of location data from the iPhone and iPad.
* According to Bloomberg, a lawsuit was filed against Apple on April 22nd in Tampa, Florida, at a federal court by iPhone user, Vikram Ajjampur, and iPad user, William Devito. The two iDevice users claim that Apple has been surreptitiously tracking the location of iPhone and iPad owners.
* They claim to have filed the lawsuit in an effort to stop the alleged data collection by Apple. 
* “The complaint cited a report last week by two computer programmers claiming that Apple’s iOS4 operating system is logging latitude-longitude coordinates along with the time a spot is visited. The programmers said Apple devices are collecting about a year’s worth of location data. Apple hasn’t commented on the matter since the April 20 report was released.
* “We take issue specifically with the notion that Apple is now basically tracking people everywhere they go,” Aaron Mayer, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said today in a telephone interview. “If you are a federal marshal, you have to have a warrant to do this kind of thing, and Apple is doing it without one.”
* While Apple CEO Steve Jobs debunked the circulating rumors regarding the tracking of data, and experts on the issue call the location database non-threatening, legal, and probably a simple mistake on Apple’s end, could this really be that serious?
* Are you concerned about this issue, or is this whole privacy issue overblown like antennagate?
* What say you?
