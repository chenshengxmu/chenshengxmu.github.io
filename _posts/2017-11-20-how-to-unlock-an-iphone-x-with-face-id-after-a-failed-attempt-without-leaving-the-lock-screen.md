* Face ID is Appleâ€™s latest attempt to revolutionize mobile device authentication, and it is magical when it works as intended. However, if you have spent a significant amount of time with the iPhone X and Face ID, you are likely to be familiar with a few semi-frequent incidents of Face ID failures. When the system fails to authenticate you, an annoying situation arises in which it is not clear as to how to trigger another attempt by Face ID to recognize your face without swiping up to trigger a second attempt and subsequently sending you to your Home Screen or last used app. If the user simply wants to unlock the iPhone X to view notifications on the Lock screen, there initially does not seem to be a simple way to do this.
* It may seem as if your only option is to lock and then wake your screen to trigger another Face ID attempt. While this works, it can be tedious and annoying if Face ID fails often for you. Luckily, there is an unmentioned, yet far more convenient way to trigger this second Face ID attempt.
* After a failed attempt, you can trigger a second attempt by attempting a gesture that may seem somewhat difficult at first. On the Lock screen after a failed authentication, slide slightly up and then down on the Home Bar at the bottom of the screen. This may seem difficult on your first few tries, but once you successfully complete it the gesture begins to feel natural. If after completing this gesture you successfully unlock your phone with Face ID, your notifications will unlock and be available for viewing.
* It is unclear if this is a feature included intentionally, but regardless it is a more convenient option than locking and waking your screen to activate a second unlock attempt.
* That is all there is to it! If you have any questions or comments, let us know down in the comments below.
