* Apple started taking pre-orders for the iPhone 5 last Friday at 12:01 am. And it wasn’t 45 minutes after that, that people started seeing estimated shipping times drop from one to two weeks.
* The Cupertino company would later announce that it sold 2 million iPhone 5s during the first 24 hours of availability. And apparently it’s having trouble keeping up with the high demand…
* As noted by MacRumors, iPhone 5 shipping times on Apple’s (US) website have slipped to 3-4 weeks for all storage sizes, colors, and carrier models. And the same goes for Canada and Australia.
* For what it’s worth, Verizon’s website is claiming its iPhone 5 orders will ship by October 5th, as is Sprint’s. But AT&T is still showing shipping estimates between 14 and 21 business days.
* Regardless, it sounds like your best bet to score an iPhone 5 in the near future is to visit your local retailer this Friday. Apple Stores will probably be the most busy, but they will also likely have the most stock on hand.
