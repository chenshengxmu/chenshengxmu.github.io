title: Dash now available on Cydia
---
* Dash — the app switcher enhancing jailbreak tweak from SBCoders — is now available for public download on Cydia.
* As we previewed a little over a week ago, Dash allows you to replace iOS’ stock app switcher for a full screen switcher reminiscent of WebOS.
* The tweak works on both the iPhone and the iPad, and features a variety of interesting animations that can be easily switched using the Settings app. Dash can be purchased for $1.99 on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. If you decide to take it for a spin, be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comment section.
