* BlackBerry users on T-Mobile who want to upgrade to a new device will now receive $250 towards the purchase of any BlackBerry phone, or $200 toward any other smartphone. The deal follows backlash from both BB loyalists and CEO John Chen regarding a recent promo offer.
* For those that missed it, T-Mobile sent out an email to its BlackBerry-using customers suggesting they switch to an iPhone 5s. Loyal BB users took to Twitter to voice their outrage at the insulting offer and BlackBerry’s Chen penned a blog post calling the whole thing “inappropriate.”
* And here’s how T-Mobile has decided to respond…
* First, an excerpt from a counter blog post by T-Mobile’s CMO Mike Sievert:
* Wow. Mind blown. 
* The passion we’ve seen from the BlackBerry Loyal over the past couple days has been pretty amazing. I want you to know we’ve heard you.
* Yesterday BlackBerry CEO John Chen posted a blog criticizing T-Mobile’s marketing to BlackBerry users.  The premise of his article was that it’s best for customers if we restrict the free flow of information and limit consumer choice.  At T-Mobile we totally reject that premise. We believe the best wireless service gives customers complete freedom and choice, and that’s what we are doing with a new offer for BlackBerry users we are announcing today.
* The way they’re handling this is actually kind of ingenious:
* Starting this Friday, we’re offering $200 credit toward a new device when you trade in your current BlackBerry and upgrade to one of the latest, greatest devices.  Purchase any device we offer at T-Mobile.  It’s that simple. Bring in your old, working BlackBerry and we’ll give you $200 toward a new BlackBerry or any of our other state-of-the-art smartphones.i  In addition, for those existing T-Mobile BlackBerry customers trading-in and choosing a new BlackBerry Q10 or Z10, we’re offering an ADDITIONAL $50 off the purchase price of that new BlackBerry. These offers will be available for a limited time. 
* This seems like less of a ‘we’re sorry’ offer and more of a subtle, clever jab at the folks in Waterloo. Sure, upset BlackBerry owners get a $250 credit for a new one, but they also get $200 to choose something else. It’s like a social experiment: how many customers will take the extra $50?
* You know CEO Johne Leger is loving this:
* If you want to stay on #blackberry, our offer is the best out there. Feel free to call me next time, Chen! 😉

* It’s simple. We give options to the 2/3 of #BlackBerry users who switch to a different OS when they upgrade. #fact #uncarrier

* I am just curious…. Pls retweet with what device you use…

* In the end, though, current BlackBerry users on T-Mobile are getting a heck of a deal—regardless of which new device they decide to go with. So if you fall in that category, I recommend taking advantage of it before it’s gone. It’s not every day you get $200 to $250 off a full retail smartphone.
* What are your thoughts on all of this?
