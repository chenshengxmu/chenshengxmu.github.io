* Twitter has many user-focused tools for curbing offensive or abusive content on the service. If you prefer using the micro-blogging service in your web browser, you may want to enable a pair of toggles in settings to prevent unwanted content from cluttering your search results.
* You can tell Twitter to prevent sensitive content as well as tweets from blocked and muted accounts from polluting your search results on Twitter.com, here’s how.
* Your search results show a combination of tweets, photos, accounts and more.
* These filters exclude content that Twitter has deemed potentially sensitive, along with accounts you have muted or blocked, from your search results on the web. You have the option to turn the safe search filter on the web off, or back on, at any time.
* To use these features, be sure to search on twitter.com as a logged-in user.
* 1) Using your desktop browser, log in to twitter.com.
* 2) Type your search query into the box at the top of the page.
