* In late 2012, Apple began work on a major 39-acre campus in Austin, Texas. According to its development agreement, the grounds will house more than 1 million square feet of office space for various operations including human resources, finance and the like.
* After completing phase one of the construction earlier this year, the campus held its opening celebration today. CEO Tim Cook was on hand for the event, offering up a recap of WWDC announcements and teasing that “exciting” new products are on the way…

* 9to5Mac reports that Eddy Cue was also in attendance, and spoke to employees about Apple’s recent high-profile acquisition of Beats Electronics. He also joined Cook in hyping up the company’s future product announcements—a common practice for the pair.
* The Austin campus looks very similar to Apple’s current Cupertino headquarters, with massive office buildings and other facilities scattered across a trove of manicured lawns and cement. It was projected to be finished in 2021, but they are a year ahead of schedule.
