* If you’re looking to customize Siri on your jailbroken iDevice, then there are already a few options available on Cydia.
* AssistantExtensions, and SiriToggles are perhaps two of the best examples of Siri customization on a jailbroken device, but there’s one in the works that’s looking like a winner as well.
* Indeed, MySiri — an upcoming Siri tweak — promises to add a ridiculous amount of end-user control to the Siri interface.
* Co-developers Andrea Oliva & Akhil Tolani provided us with a sneak peak of the upcoming tweak. Check inside as we give it the full video preview…
* MySiri includes the ability to execute Activator actions using your voice, create your own conversations, enable or disable toggles, perform commands like respring, restart, reboot, and create your own custom background.
* The nice thing about MySiri is that virtually every aspect is customizable in a sense that you can create your own predefined voice commands.
* Of course the tweak is still in development, and I wasn’t personally able to have success with all facets. The good news is that by the time it is released, all aspects should be working seamlessly.
* If your iPhone 4S is jailbroken, or you’re running Spire on your pre-4S device, then MySiri should definitely be on your radar. It’ll be available for $0.99 on the BigBoss repo once released.
* What do you think?
* UPDATE: This tweak is now called ‘MyAssistant’.
