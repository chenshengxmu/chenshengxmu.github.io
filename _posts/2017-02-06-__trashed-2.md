* Apple on Monday seeded to its registered developers second betas of what would become iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 software updates. iOS 10.3 beta 2 (build 14E5239e), watchOS 3.2 beta 2 (build 14V5214d) and tvOS 10.2 beta 2 (build 14W5231d) can now be deployed on devices with a prior beta and an appropriate configuration profile.
* The latest betas arrived two weeks after iOS 10.3 launched for developer testing and a week following the first beta of watchOS 3.2. tvOS 10.2 beta 1 arrived on January 24.
* iOS 10.3 includes a bunch of new features and under-the-hood tweaks, including one that lets owners of AirPods to locate their misplaced earbud. Additionally, a one-handed floating iPad keyboard was discovered in iOS 10.3 code, but there’s no telling whether the software update will enable it for everyone when it launches publicly.
* It’s been discovered that iOS 10.3 will permit third-party apps to update their icon on the Home screen dynamically without requiring an update. This feature should allow apps to convey various states through the Home screen icon. For instance, an app’s icon could change when you upgrade to the full version via the In-App Purchase mechanism.
