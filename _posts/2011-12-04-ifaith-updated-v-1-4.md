* Infamous iOS hacker and Sn0wBreeze creator iH8sn0w just released a major update for his iFaith application. Like TinyUmbrella, iFaith allows you to save your device’s SHSH blobs, which are needed to preserve your ability to downgrade firmware in the future.
* The update supports iOS versions up to 5.0.1, but isn’t yet compatible with A5 iDevices. There also doesn’t seem to be a Mac version available. But if you own an A4 device and have access to a Windows computer, we highly recommend you download the new iFaith…
* Most of you are probably aware by now that downgrading firmware in iOS 5 is nearly impossible. Apple has started signing SHSH blobs differently in iOS 5 than it did in previous versions, disabling users from replaying them during a firmware restore.
* But iFaith doesn’t just save your SHSH blobs, it also saves the accompanying AP ticket, making downgrading theoretically possible (to a custom IPSW). Watch:
* iFaith’s update also brings about some major bug fixes, and iH8sn0w says that blob-dumping is now much faster. If you happen to fit the criteria for the software, we strongly suggest downloading it. You can grab the new iFaith from our Downloads page.
