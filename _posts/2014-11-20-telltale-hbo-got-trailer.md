* After dropping some details regarding its upcoming ‘Game of Thrones’ game last week, Telltale Games today released its first trailer. The video sets the stage for what could be Telltale’s biggest releases, given how popular HBO’s GOT franchise has become.
* The game will tell the story of the House Forrester, a noble family from the north of Westerns, loyal to the Starks Winterfell. Players will take on the role of different members of the Forrester household, and determine their fates. Here’s the new trailer.
* This new story tells of House Forrester, a noble family from the north of Westeros, loyal to the Starks of Winterfell. Caught up in the events surrounding the War of the Five Kings, they are thrown into a maelstrom of bloody warfare, revenge, intrigue, and horror as they fight to survive while the seven kingdoms tear themselves apart.
* You will take on the role of different members of the Forrester household, and determine their fate through the choices you make; your actions and decisions will change the story around you.
* Similar to Telltale’s other hits, Game of Thrones will be an episodic thriller, with a storyline that’s based on the decisions you make throughout. And of course it’ll be littered with interactive characters and familiar locations like King’s Landing and The Wall.
* There’s no word on when the game will become available, but given the recent ramp up in PR and promotions, it seems like it’s going to be sooner than later. Telltale is also working on another new title, Tales from the Borderlands, expected early next year.
