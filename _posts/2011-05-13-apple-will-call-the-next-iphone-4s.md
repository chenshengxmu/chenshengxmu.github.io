* We’ve heard iPhone 5, 4G, 4GS, and 4S as possible names for Apple’s next gen iPhone. Recently, select develepors started receiving iPhone ‘4S’ prototypes for testing purposes. There’s even been some leaked images of what is an alleged iPhone 4S with a slightly larger screen than the iPhone 4.
* Following other hints that the next iPhone will be called the “4S,” an industry analyst from Jefferies has reported that Apple will indeed call the device the iPhone 4S.
* BusinessInsider,
* “Apple’s next iPhone will be called the iPhone 4S, not the iPhone 5, according to “industry checks” by Jefferies analyst Peter Misek.
* Misek put out a note on the next iPhone today, and said, it will “include minor cosmetic changes, better cameras, A5 dual-core processor, and HSPA+ support.”
* So there you have it, folks; an iPhone 4S with better cameras (we suspect 8MP Sony sensors), the dual-core A5 chip, and support for 4G data speeds. All of these specs have been heard before, but it seems like it’s almost a given for the changes listed in this new report.
* We’ve talked about the possibility of 4G/LTE coming to the next iPhone, and it was believed that the chips Apple needed to implement HSPA+ support simply weren’t available in time for a release this September. According to this analyst, we’ll actually see HSPA+ support from Apple’s next gen iPhone.
* This report also confirms the news that the next iPhone will be a ‘global device‘ capable of running on all carriers. It’s still possible that Apple could release two iPhone models this September, but we have yet to hear anymore confirmation.
* Do you like the sound of the “iPhone 4S?”
