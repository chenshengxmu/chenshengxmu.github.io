* The official movie trailer launched for Star Wars: The Last Jedi thisÂ week at Star Wars Celebration. The two-minute teaser trailer already answers some questions from The Force Awakens and only stirs more unanswered rumors in the Star Wars universe. Star Wars Celebration is concluding today, but if you want to dive into the convention, just download the official mobile app.
* Inside the Wallpapers of the Week post, you will find seven iPhone wallpapers captured directly from the movie trailer. Make sure to scroll all the way down, for links to previous Star Wars wallpaper collections! Get hyped for the upcoming movie, by downloading these wallpapers for your devices.
* The following images were edited shots directly from the official Star Wars: The Last Jedi teaser trailer. Consequently, I was able to scale the images for iPhone 6/s/7, but they are not that great for Plus-sized devices. Moreover, the image quality is high, but not actual photo quality. The trailer itself is a little gritty, which naturally translates in the wallpapers. As photo quality images of the film are actually released, you can assume we will be posting new wallpapers, when marketing for the film begins to increase.
* If you are able to grab some similar shots and edit them for iPhone sized devices, submit them in the comments below, or catch up with me via @jim_gresham. As always, if you find incredible wallpapers shoot them my way, regardless of topic!
* Hat tip to @k33rg and @laughingquoll, for sending some my way.
