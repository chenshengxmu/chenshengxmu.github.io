* Good news for folks who stuck around on iOS 6.1.3/4 in hopes of scoring an early jailbreak, developer winocm has confirmed that a public release for his late-version iOS 6 hack will be available in the next few months.
* Winocm has been working on an iOS 6.1.3/4 jailbreak for a few months now. He’s shown it off on video, and even let our very own Jeff take it for a spin. And today he answered the oft-asked ETA question: ‘before 2014.’
* Here’s the series of tweets we’re referring to:
* Thanks to everyone who are dumping iPad kernels. It helps a lot.
* — winocm (@winocm) October 7, 2013
* It speeds things up with the 6.1.3/.4 jailbreak. (A lot).
* — winocm (@winocm) October 7, 2013
* A definite ETA is before 2014.
* — winocm (@winocm) October 7, 2013
* The developer completes the announcement by asking folks to “Please be patient,” saying “we are all trying to get things done as soon as possible.” And he has since retweeted a couple of users telling him to take his time.
* And it’s a good thing winocm is making sure they get things right. Any Restore-inducing flaw in his hack would essentially be jailbreak-fatal, as users would be forced to update to iOS 7 and there’s no way to downgrade.
* On that note, the evad3rs have said that they are making progress on the iOS 7 jailbreak, but no ETA (or estimated time of arrival) has been given on that front. Stay tuned.
