* On Thursday, March 10, Apple sent invitations for their media event, “Let us loop you in,” to be held on Monday, March 21. The event is said to reveal a completely new handset, dubbed the iPhone SE. In addition, a refresh of the iPad Air is expected to bring the device more in-line with iPad Pro. Finally, there is a potential for new Apple Watch accessories, specifically bands, and updates to the operating systems for OS X, iOS, and Watch OS.
* The invitation, which always includes an image, will no doubt send the blogosphere reeling with guesses about hidden images that are allegedly included. At iDownloadBlog, we simply like to enjoy the invitation designs and celebrate them with a collection of wallpapers. Inside you will find Apple media event wallpapers for iPhone and Apple Watch.
* If you have images you would like to submit for our Wallpapers of the Week, make sure to connect with me on Twitter via @jim_gresham. It would be great if we were able to include an iPad version as well!
* The following wallpapers are courtesy of our friend @AR72014.
