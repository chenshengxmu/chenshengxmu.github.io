* What was once “Apple Store Fifth Avenue” is now just “Apple Fifth Avenue” as the Cupertino firm starts dropping “Store” branding from its retail locations and online. The change is live on the Apple Retail website as brick-and-mortar locations no longer have “Store” titling, as first discovered by MacRumors.
* That’s part of Apple’s planned simplification of Apple Store branding under the leadership of retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Recent press releases announcing Apple’s first Brooklyn store and a new World Trade Center outlet refer to these locations simply as “Apple Williamsburg” and “Apple World Trade Center,” but the change may have started rolling out with the launch of the Union Square location in San Francisco as the firm’s always referred to that store as just “Apple Union Square”.
* MacRumors says Apple recently sent out a memo to its retail army to let them know that the “Store” branding is gradually being dropped from both retail locations and online.
* “While Apple told employees the change will be gradual and will start with new stores, pages for almost all stores have been updated to remove the ‘Store’ titling,” the publication explains.
