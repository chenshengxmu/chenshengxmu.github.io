* The news just fell that LimeRa1n has been released. If you follow the major iPhone hackers on Twitter you probably got a good feel of what to expect from LimeRa1n: a buggy and untested jailbreak.
* So really, the question is: should you use LimeRa1n? Should you put your iPhone in jeopardy? Or should you wait for GreenPois0n or PwnageTool?
* To be honest, if I were you, I would stay away from LimeRa1n, at least for the time being. It might be the best and ost stable jailbreak in the world, but chances are itâ€™s all the opposite.
* When I see what the Dev Team and Chronic Dev say about LimeRa1n, I just want to stay away from it. Bottomline is, you do what you want with your iPhone. Let us know what you decide to do and why.
