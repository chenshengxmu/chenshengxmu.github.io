* CCVertically is an interesting new jailbreak tweak that puts a vertical spin on Control Center.
* You’re probably used to seeing everything horizontally, so the vertical view might take some getting used to, but it really doesn’t look that bad overall.
* It comes with a few options to configure so you can choose what pages the effects work on and whether or not text appears, but the default settings are pretty good just how they come.
* You can read our full review of CCVertically to learn more about how it works.
* MusicMoreColumns – FREE

* Admittedly, I’m not a fan of the most recent changes to the Music app, and the UI feels way too under-detailed to me.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called MusicMoreColumns helps with the issue a little bit by adding a third column of music to the Music app. This means you can see more at a glance without having to do as much scrolling.
* While it’s a minor adjustment, it really has a positive influence on the usage of the app, so I would recommend this to all jailbreakers who use the Music app to listen to songs.
* You can read our full review of MusicMoreColumns to find out why the tweak is a beneficial addition to any device.
* WAStatusVolume – $0.99

* WAStatusVolume is a new jailbreak tweak that brings a WhatsApp-styled volume HUD to iOS.
* This replaces the system-wide volume HUD that everyone loathes and it’s a better solution because it gets the point across and doesn’t take up much of the display.
* You can customize where on the screen it appears and you can even tinker with the colors and such.
