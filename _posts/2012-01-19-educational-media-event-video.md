* Were you one of the one’s that didn’t enjoy standing in the freezing cold in NYC waiting to be let into Apple’s Media event? If so, then you were likely relegated to taking in one of many “live blogging” sessions posted by various online tech blogs.
* For those of you wishing to consume the full media event as it was meant to be seen, then Apple has posted the entire one hour video online for your convenience. Be warned, it’s not the best quality, but it will do until a higher quality version is made available.
* Head over to there to download the video directly from iTunes.
* If you missed our coverage concerning iBooks 2, or iBooks Author, hit the respective links for more details. We’ve also tried both iBooks 2 and iBooks Author for ourselves, and captured it on video.
