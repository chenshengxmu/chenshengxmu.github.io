* Among a flurry of yesterday’s announcements at the Google I/O developer conference, the Internet giant launched Google Photos, its brand spanking new photography service available across iOS, Android and on the web. It offers unlimited storage (with a  few caveats) and has many other compelling features that give Apple’s iCloud Photo Library a fairly good run for its money.
* To name but a few: world-class facial recognition that understands aging, sleek design, fast performance, unmatched search and machine intelligence, the ability to create a movie, collage or animated GIF in seconds and more.
* The question is, will you be turning to Google Photos as a backup solution for the media you’ve amassed on your iOS device? Or, perhaps you’ll be sticking with Apple’s iCloud Photo Library even though it offers a meager five gigabytes of free cloud storage? Planning on using Google Photos alongside iCloud Photo Library, are we? Not a big fan of either service, you say?
* Tell us in today’s poll!
* Before you vote and jump straight to comments, consider the following caveats.
* Apple gives each iCloud account five gigabytes of free cloud storage that can be used to back up your photo library using Photos for iOS and OS X and iCloud Photo Library.
* Apple’s service always stores your photos and videos in the cloud in their full resolution, with an option to push media in device-optimized resolution to your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad to preserve storage space.
* Google Photos offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos, but downscales image to sixteen megapixels and re-encodes videos to 1080p. So, if you have DSLR photos larger than 16MP, or shoot video in 4K, Google will keep them in the cloud in a reduced resolution.
* The benefit: your photos will still look good in print but take up less space.
* The downside: if you want to upload your media to Google Photos exactly as you captured it—without compression artifacts due to downscaling—you’ll have to do with just fifteen gigabytes of free storage.
* Cast your vote below.
* How does Google Photos compare to Apple’s Photos app and iCloud Photo Library?
* Of course, both Google and Apple offer paid storage upgrades.
* With iCloud, you can purchase storage tiers in 20GB/200GB/500GB/1TB increments for $0.99/$3.99/$9.99/$19.99 per month, respectively.
* Google sells 100GB/1TB storage upgrades for $1.99/$9.99 per month, with additional 10TB/20TB/30TB tiers costing $99/$199.99/$299.99 per month, respectively.
* Google Photos for iPhone and iPad is free in the App Store.
* Which service do you use to back up your photos in the cloud?
* We’re especially eager to hear from readers who swear by Dropbox, Flickr or OneDrive to preserve their memories. What’s your experience with these services been so far?
* Tell us in comments.
