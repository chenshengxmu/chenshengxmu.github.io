* Looking for a quick and easy way to add tint to the stock iOS chrome, but don’t feel like bothering with WinterBoard? If so, then an upcoming tweak from @winocm may be of interest to you.
* The tweak is called Accentify, and it allows you to select from eight different and highly vibrant tints to accentuate iOS. The tint applies to multiple areas, and its vibrant colors allow for a very distinct, almost candy-like look. Take a look inside for more information.
* Status bar tint, too

* One thing that isn’t showcased on the GIF animation above, is Accentify’s ability to tint the status bar along with the rest of the chrome elements. See the image above for an example of what I mean.
* Select from eight different tints

* Accentify works with many of the stock iOS apps such as Mail, Settings, Safari, Videos, and more. Although it’s still in development, I can assure you that this will be a beautiful tweak once it’s completed. The colors pop so much for a vivid remix of the stock iOS Chrome, and I love it.
* This is how Mail looks with Accentify
