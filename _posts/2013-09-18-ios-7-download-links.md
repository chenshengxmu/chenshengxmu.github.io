* Apple’s just let iOS 7 out of the cage (what, you haven’t heard?). Although the firm initially released the software as an over-the-air update weighing in at 1+ gigabyte, some folks like yours truly prefer starting afresh with each major new iOS release.
* There are plenty of reasons to do that, from getting rid of the junk amassed from previous updates for maximum speed to rethinking which apps to install and how you want your devices set up. If you’re going to do a clean install, you’re going to need direct download links for iOS 7 that I’ve included for your pleasure right after the break…
* You can grab a firmware update for your device from the iDB Download page.
* Please know that download links for the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c are for the iOS 7.0.1 version, not iOS 7.0. People who are jailbroken should steer away from iOS 7 until we receive more information on the state of the iOS 7 jailbreak.
* The iDB Download page also contains links to past iOS firmwares, in addition to indispensable jailbreak tools and much more so give it a thorough read.
* If you’re going to do a clean install of iOS 7, you’ll need the appropriate firmware file and the latest iTunes version 11.1 with support for iOS 7 installations and syncing.
* Cody has a couple advices for those looking to upgrade their iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices to iOS 7, like saving your SHSH blobs and checking device compatibility. Performing a clean install requires backing up your device beforehand so do check out my guide on installing iOS 7 to ensure a hassle-free experience.

* Furthermore, Sebastien’s done a nice write-up listing every new feature and improvement in iOS 7, big and small alike, and Cody is busy adding notable third-party apps to our running list of major iOS 7 app updates.
* Finally, Apple on its part posted the official iPod touch and iPad User Guide for iOS 7 in the form of free electronic books on the iBookstore.
