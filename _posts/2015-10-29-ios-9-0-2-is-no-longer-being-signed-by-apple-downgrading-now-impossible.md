title: iOS 9.0.2 is no longer being signed by Apple, downgrading now impossible
---
* Apple has stopped signing all versions of iOS 9.0.2 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch this afternoon.Â As always, the closing of this signing window makes downgrading to this software version impossible.
* Users who jailbreak their devices are the ones to get most likely affected by this situation. With downgrading now impossible, jailbreak users must be careful to not accidentally update to iOS 9.1 and lose their jailbreak in the process.
