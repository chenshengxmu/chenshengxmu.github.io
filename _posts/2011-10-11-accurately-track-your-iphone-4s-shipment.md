* Needless to say, the last few days have been both frustrating and exciting. Exciting because I was among the first to order my iPhone 4S on Friday morning; frustrating because Apple’s order status page still reads “Preparing for Shipment”.
* This wouldn’t be so annoying if it weren’t for the fact that most of the iDB staff received shipment notifications a while ago.
* I know, first world problems indeed, but a problem it was. Thankfully, there’s a quick and easy way to gather accurate results about the whereabouts of your new iPhone 4S. I show you how in this video tutorial…
* As you can see from the video, UPS’ and FedEx’s track by reference is a great tool to have, not just for the iPhone 4S, but for any item that you’re anxiously awaiting.
* Using this method, you can instead use referential material in a way that allows you to pin down the location of your new iPhone.
* And Apple, I understand that your servers are bogged down from your 1 million plus pre-orders, but you just can’t play with a man’s heart like this.
* I can’t guarantee this will work, especially if your item hasn’t actually shipped, but it did work for me.
* Did track by reference help you? If so, let me know in the comments below!
* Note: A reader points out that it’s also handy to click “Request Status Updates” on the UPS page, to get text alerts about the whereabouts of your iPhone 4S. I did this, and indeed, it’s a great way to keep tabs on your device, without visiting the website every five minutes. Thanks Christopher!
