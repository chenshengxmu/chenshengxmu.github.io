title: How to repost Instagram photos and videos on iPhone
---
* The Instagram app lacks the option to repost Instagram photos and videos natively, so people usually screenshot photos to post them as their own. This works fine as a workaround but requires extra steps, such as cropping the screenshot. Maybe more importantly, it generates photos of poor quality.
* Reposting, also known as regramming, is quite a common practice, even though the Instagram application doesn’t provide a way to easily do that. As a result, you must use third-party applications. In this post, we will show you how to repost Instagram photos and videos from your iPhone using an app called Regrammer.
* 1) In the Instagram app, find the photo or video you want to repost. When you have found it, tap on the ” … ” icon above it. This will bring up several options. Select Copy Link. Note that if the profile is set to private, you will not be able to copy the link.

* 2) Download and launch the Regrammer app on your iPhone. The app should paste the link automatically. If it doesn’t, paste the link manually into the text field. Then hit Preview.

* 3) Tap on the Repost icon.
* 4) From the menu that opens, select Instagram. This will effectively copy the photo to Instagram for you to edit and repost. Note that you will be asked to grant the app access to your photos the first time you use it. This is a necessary step which you will encounter only the first time.
* As an alternative, you can also share the photo or video to Facebook, Twitter. Furthermore, you can also choose the More option to share the photo to any other app on your iPhone, or even save it to your photo library.

* 5) From there, you can choose whether you want to post the photo to your Story or to your feed, select a filter, write a caption, and repost the photo to your Instagram account.

* Before signing off, let me just briefly mention a few noteworthy things regarding reposting other people’s photos and videos on Instagram.
* As per Instagram’s Terms of Use, those who repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights run the risk of having their Instagram account terminated. Users on Instagram may not post copyrighted content to the service unless they own it or have permission to post it.
* Reposting someone else’s Instagrams through your own account without properly crediting them is a clear violation of Instagram’s Terms of Use. “Remember to post authentic content, and don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post,” the terms of service read.
* The best way to avoid any problems is to credit the original Instagramer:
* Instagram clearly states that the photos posted on the service belong to the original photographer. If you repost someone else’s work without properly crediting them, your account may get banned. Depending on where you live, posting or reposting copyrighted content without permission may be a violation of the law.
