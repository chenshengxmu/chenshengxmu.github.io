* While we’re all getting so uptight about whether the incoming iPhone will be of the 4S or 5 designation, and thus, whether it will receive a new design or not, MacRumors is there to bring us all back to reality.
* The site’s founder, Arnold Kim, has sought to remind us all that, while all the glitz and glamor of possible redesign is tempting, we’re forgetting about the specs that will actually power the device.  lt’s obvious that the next iPhone will feature Apple’s impressive A5 chip architecture — the chip that currently powers the iPad 2.
* That fact alone means we’ll have a significantly faster iPhone to buy. Check out the impressive benchmark breakdown inside…

* Citing some existing research by Anandetech, Kim points to a graph which shows graphics performance for some of the most popular smartphones and tablets on the planet, including the iPhone 4. Sitting at the top of that pile is Apple’s iPad 2 which houses, you guessed it, the A5 processor – the very processor we all universally believe will be at the heart of whichever iPhone Apple sees fit to announce during tomorrow’s event.
* A word of caution: just because the iPhone 4S/5 will receive the same CPU and GPU combination as the iPad 2, that doesn’t mean that performance will be entirely comparable. We wouldn’t be at all surprised if Apple has to underclock the whole shebang in order to make it play nicely with the iPhone’s smaller battery. Remember, that iPad 2 you’re using is mainly glass and battery. Lots of battery.
* The most exciting thing now is that we don’t have long to wait until all the rumors come to an end. In a little over 24 hours we’ll know just what Apple’s next iPhone is and, fingers crossed, we’ll be hitting refresh on Apple’s online store trying to order one!
