* After literally years of waiting, Facebook’s iOS app was recently re-written from scratch with performance in mind. That said, it goes without saying that we’re positively shocked to see Zuck & Co. just push out a timely update to Facebook’s official iOS client.
* It adds full support for iOS 6, just 24 hours following its public release. The new version also mentions iPhone 5 support, but Facebook stopped short of detailing what that means. We have a huch it’s got to do something with taking advantage of that taller display. Here’s your changelog…
* Official notes still list enhancements from the previous versions. These include “faster than ever” scrolling through your news feed and twice as fast opening and closing of photos using downward swipe.
* Also from the previous version: performance tweaks, bug fixes, faster access to notifications and a new banner that you can tap to quickly see more stories without having to manually refresh.
* Here, your iTunes release notes concerning Facebook for iOS version 5.0.1:
* We’ve rebuilt the app so it’s faster and easier to use.
* • scrolling through news feed is faster than ever • new banner lets you tap to quickly see more stories – no need to refresh • photos open fast and close with one downward swipe • instant access to your notifications • Support for iOS 6 and iPhone 5 (new in version 5.0.1) • bug fixes
* Facebook is a free universal binary download right from the App Store.
* If you use Android, Facebook announced that its Messenger for Android app was updated today with a revamped conversation view and the ability to send text messaging on certain HTC, Samsung and LG phones.
* Facebook Messenger for Android version 2.0.1 is available now via Google’s Play Store.

* The company says that an update to Messenger for iOS “will be available soon”.
* Also new in Messenger for Android: a button in upper right of News Feed to show chat availability, an online status indicator and all-new chat view design featuring swipeable pane.
* Another popular program, Tweetbot for iPad, was just updated with full iOS 6 support. Note that the app is currently on sale (just $0.99), but not for much longer.
