* Apple’s boss Tim Cook went to China to meet with a top Chinese government official in Beijing amid allegations of government-backed phishing attempts on users’ iCloud accounts, according to a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency, relayed by Reuters Wednesday.
* The meeting coincides with reports by GreatFire.org, a Chinese web monitoring group, alleging that the Chinese government sponsored man-in-the-middle attacks that redirected local users to a fake iCloud.com login page in an effort to harvest Apple ID user names and passwords.
* Cook and Vice Premier Ma Kai reportedly exchanged views on “protection of users’ information” as well as ”strengthening cooperation and in information and communication fields,” Xinhua reported.
* Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, told the media yesterday that the government was “resolutely opposed” to hacking. It’s worth remembering that the government operates a nationwide firewall allowing it to arbitrarily block traffic to and from certain websites, thereby limiting what the Chinese users can do online.
* Greatfire is said to have told Reuters that Apple appeared to have rerouted user data on Tuesday in order to circumvent the hack.
* Responding to the attacks, Apple issued a support document yesterday outlining browser security. Users in China predominantly use the popular Chinese browser Qihoo, which lacks anti-phishing measures and does not warn users that they’re visiting a spoofed page.
* The firm underscored that the attempted attacks did not affect iCloud sign-in on mobile and Macs that are running the most up to date version of OS X.
* “We’re aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates to obtain user information, and we take this very seriously,” reads the support document.
