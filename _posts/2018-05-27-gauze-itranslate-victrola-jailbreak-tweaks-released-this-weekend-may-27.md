* It’s Sunday again, and that means it’s time for another jailbreak tweak roundup.
* This roundup post will encompass all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from May 21st until May 27th. As usual, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorites and then outline the rest of them afterward.

* Apple’s modern App Switcher requires a lot of scrolling back and forth to get to the app(s) you want. That said, why not make things slightly easier with a new jailbreak tweak called Gauze?
* Gauze provides users with a grid-style App Switcher, allowing them to perform more actions at a glance. The tweak automatically scales the size of the app preview screenshots to fit the grid, and automatically fills the gaps as you force-close apps.
* You can learn more about Gauze and why it offers improvements over the stock App Switcher in our full review.

* iTranslate adds a convenient ‘Translate’ button directly to your iPhone’s native web browser: Safari. You can access it by highlighting text on any web page and tapping on the Translate button that appears inside of the Copy/Paste menu.
* Upon tapping on the Translate button, iTranslate launches a Google Translate page and translates any text you may have had highlighted. Easy peasy!
* You can learn more about iTranslate and why it’s a must-have tweak in our full review.

* If you have an iPhone 5s or earlier running iOS 10.2 or later, then you won’t see contact avatars at the top of the Messages app as you would on larger handsets like the iPhone 6 and newer.
* Navatar changes that by compelling iOS to display the contact avatar in your navigation bar. You will see either a contact photo or the contact’s first and last initials, depending on whether you’ve configured a contact photo for the recipient or not.
* You can learn more about Navatar and how it get in our full review.

* Victrola is a new take on the appearance of your Lock screen’s Now Playing music controls. It does away with the bland square look and feel and replaces it with one that seems more modern.
* One of the most striking differences is the shape of the album artwork, but you’ll also notice how the progress indicator wraps around the circular artwork display.
* Victrola is in its early stages as of this writing, but the developer teases numerous features that should come in a future update. You can learn more about them in our full review.
