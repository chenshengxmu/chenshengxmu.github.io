* Find My iPhone is a great way to secure your iPhone in case it is lost or stolen, but it doesn’t do much to protect your SIM card. Indeed, without a PIN enabled on your SIM, anyone with access to your SIM card can use it to make phone calls, send messages, and use cellular data.
* This is of course a worst case scenario that I am describing here, but securing your SIM card with a Personal Identification Number is a great way to add another level of security to your phone and make sure that even if the device itself becomes compromised, your cellular plan can remain somewhat protected.
* 1) Open the Settings app, and go to Phone > SIM PIN, then enable the SIM PIN toggle.
* 2) If this is your first time setting up a SIM PIN, you will be required to create a new PIN containing 4 to 8 numbers. If you previously had a PIN enabled, you will have to re-enter that PIN to enable SIM protection.
* 1) Launch the Settings app, and go to Phone > SIM PIN, then disable the SIM PIN toggle.
* 2) Enter your PIN code in order to validate your request to disable SIM PIN, then tap Done.
* Every time you reboot your iPhone, or if you insert the SIM card in a different phone, you will have to enter your SIM PIN to unlock the SIM card. As mentioned above, this is a great way to secure your SIM card and make sure that in the event someone stole your iPhone, they wouldn’t be able to re-use that SIM card in a different phone.
* Be very careful not to forget that SIM PIN though, or else your SIM card will be locked and you will have to get in touch with your carrier to obtain a PUK code in order to unlock the locked SIM card.
