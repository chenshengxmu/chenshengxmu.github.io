* If you want to quickly close all of the open Safari tabs on your iPhone running iOS 9, then there’s a new jailbreak tweak that you might be interested in. The properly named Safari Close All Tabs is a jailbreak tweak that makes it easy to quickly close all open Safari tabs.
* But there’s more to Safari Close All Tabs than first meets the eye. The tweak also lends the ability to whitelist specific tabs that you wish to keep open.
* After installing Safari Close All Tabs, it’s just a matter of opening Safari and tapping the tab button in the bottom right-hand corner. Inside the tab interface, you’ll see a new ‘x’ button dedicated to closing all tabs in one fell swoop. You’ll receive a confirmation dialogue before all tabs are closed to prevent accidental closures.
* To whitelist a tab to prevent it from closing, press and hold the tab with two fingers until the lock icon indicator in the top left-hand corner of the tab lights up. Locked tabs will stay open, even after confirming a close-all action.
* There are no options or settings to configure to begin using Safari Close All Tabs. It’s a great tweak that makes quickly closing out of multiple Safari tabs a pain free process.
* What do you think?
