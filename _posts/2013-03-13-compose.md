* Looking for a quick and easy way to compose new messages and emails via Notification Center? Then perhaps Compose — a new jailbreak tweak that places shortcuts to each respective app in Notification Center — will suit your fancy.
* Compose follows the same visual template that Apple created with its Facebook and Twitter Notification Center shortcuts, but it doesn’t work exactly the same. Instead of opening up a small pop-up box to type in any content you wish to share, Compose works more like a shortcut to each respective app. More details inside…
* In the case of text messaging, Compose will close out of Notification Center, and go into the app switching animation when switching over to the Messages app. When it comes to composing a new mail, the new mail composition window pops up within the Notification Center, yet it still opens in a full screen window.
* For those of you looking for a style similar to the stock Twitter and Facebook sharing buttons, you may come away a bit disappointed. If all you’re looking for is a simple shortcut to each respective app, then I’d imagine you’d be satisfied.
* Compose is available free of charge on Cydia’s ModMyi repo, be sure to share your thoughts about it below.
