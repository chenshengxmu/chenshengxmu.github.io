* We love Spotify here at iDB as much as the next guy. Personally speaking, I rarely buy music files these days from iTunes and instead choose to pay ten bucks a month to stream my music. And with approximately twenty million songs available for streaming, Spotify pretty much has me covered.
* With today’s update, the popular Swedish music startup has become more useful, especially should you happen to listen to music while driving (who doesn’t?) and own a Ford vehicle supporting the company’s SYNC AppLink solution. Just like BMW’s ConnectedDrive Apps platform, the AppLink platform from Ford allows iPhone, Android and BlackBerry devices to run approved applications using the car’s steering wheel buttons, radio or voice commands…
* Spotify 0.6.2, now available as a free iOS download from the App Store, lets you listen to Spotify music in your car with the Ford SYNC AppLink platform.
* “Log into your Premium account on your iOS device and connect it to SYNC AppLink,” per release notes. “Enjoy voice-controlled access to all your favourite music, playlists and radio.”

* With Spotify now available on select vehicles equipped with available SYNC with SYNC AppLink, it’s easier than ever to find the right music for every road trip. Just log into your Spotify Premium account and connect your device to SYNC AppLink.
* With simple voice commands, you’ll have easy, hands-free access to all your music, playlists and Spotify Radio stations. Say “play starred” to access the songs you can’t get enough of and even launch playlists sent by friends just by saying “yes” to play.
* Needless to say, you can stream songs using your iPhone’s or iPad’s cellular connection or opt to mark any number of individual tracks for offline listening.
* This Spotify update also fixes a bug which prevented viewing of your friends’ top tracks.
