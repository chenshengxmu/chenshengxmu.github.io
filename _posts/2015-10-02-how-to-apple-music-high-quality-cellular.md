* Enabling hight bit rates ensures that songs you stream or download for offline listening are delivered at the highest quality at all times, whether on Wi-Fi or cellular.
* Apple doesn’t disclose exact Apple Music bitrates, but reports claimed audio streams max out at 256kbps in the AAC format.
* Higher bit rates consume more cellular data and songs may take longer to start playing. You might want to disable the aforesaid options in order to limit Apple Music to Wi-Fi connections only, which ensures that streaming won’t eat up into your mobile data.
