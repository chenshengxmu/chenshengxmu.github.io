* DigiTimes is out with a new report today claiming that it has learned that Apple is looking to adopt in-cell touch panels for future iPhones — possibly even this year’s model. As usual, the information in the report is attributed to supply chain chatter.
* Why is this a big deal? Well, if it’s true, it could make future iPhones significantly thinner. Unlike on-cell panels, which Apple uses in its current handsets, in-cell panels combine touch sensors and color filters into one layer, making the touch panel much thinner…
* “Apple’s new iPhone, which is expected to be released in the third quarter of 2012, is likely to adopt in-cell touch panels rolled out by Sharp and Toshiba Mobile Display (TMD), according to sources in Apple’s supply chain.
* An improvement in yield rates of the in-cell touch panels at Sharp and TMD has persuaded Apple to choose to cooperate with Japan-based panel makers, the sources noted.”
* It’s worth pointing out that DigiTimes has a shaky track record when it comes to Apple news. That being said, it’s not hard to believe that Apple would go with a cheaper, thinner touch panel for future handsets.
* Not to mention, if it’s going to fit things like LTE and [hopefully] a bigger battery in its upcoming iPhone, it’s going to have to shave space somewhere.
