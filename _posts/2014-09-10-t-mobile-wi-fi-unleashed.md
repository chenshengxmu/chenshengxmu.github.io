* During its 7.0 Un-carrier event today, T-Mobile announced plans for its new ‘Wi-Fi Unleashed’ initiative. As part of the campaign, the carrier says that it will support Wi-Fi calling and texting on all new smartphones, including the just-announced iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
* This allows users to send and receive both calls and text messages over a Wi-Fi network, and is a highly sought after feature for folks in areas with poor cell service. T-Mobile says the feature will be free, and is offering upgrades to customers that don’t have Wi-Fi devices.
* Additionally, the company announced a new product for subscribers in poor service areas called the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot. It’s essentially a Wi-Fi router, which can be used alongside or in place of a traditional router, made to prioritize bandwidth for HD voice calls.
* The CellSpot features 802.11ac support, USB 3.0, and covers an area of 3,000 sq. feet. It launches September 17th, and can either be leased for free, or purchased outright for $99. T-Mobile also said it has struck a deal with Gogo, which will give its users free in-flight Wi-Fi.

* It’s been an interesting few months for T-Mobile and its outspoken CEO John Legere, following the failed acquisition by Sprint. Legere said onstage today that his company is stealing subscribers from competitors at a rapid pace, thanks largely to Uncarrier initiatives like this.
* Both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus support Wi-Fi calling, and they will be available for purchase starting September 19th.
