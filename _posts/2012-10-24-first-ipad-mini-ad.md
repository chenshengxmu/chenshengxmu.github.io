* Remember that cool TV spot Apple played during its media event yesterday? The one that featured a full-sized iPad and an iPad mini playing a duet in piano apps? Well it hit YouTube just a little bit ago, and is now available for your viewing pleasure…
* The ad, developed by TBWA\ Media Arts Lab, is classic Apple (at least in the iOS era). There’s no commentary, just two iPads, one 9.7-inch and one 7.9-inch. And the message seems pretty clear: the iPad mini is just as capable as its larger sibling.
* Apple unveiled the smaller tablet yesterday after years of rumors and speculation about its existence. The iPad mini comes in both Wi-Fi only and + cellular models with LTE chips, and starts at $329. Pre-orders begin this Friday, October 26.
* What did you think of the ad?
