* Apple released iOS 5 Beta 6 yesterday to developers. What we hadn’t confirmed, until now, is the expiration date of the latest beta release.
* As you may know, all iOS beta versions that Apple releases have an expiration date, and past this expiration date, devices that haven’t been updated will be disabled, that is, at least until they’re updated to a newer version…
* iOS hacker iH8Sn0w announced yesterday on Twitter that iOS 5 Beta 6 will expire on September 29, at 8pm.
* Of course, by that time, Apple will have already released the 7th version, or maybe the GM release. Who knows, maybe the official iOS 5 release will be out by then. We certainly hope so.
* Questions? Comments?
