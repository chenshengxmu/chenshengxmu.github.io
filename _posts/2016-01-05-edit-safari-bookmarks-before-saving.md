* I’ve always found it to be a bit odd that you have to save a bookmark before you’re able to edit its URL. It’s odd to me because the URL is displayed as you’re adding the bookmark, so it’s not like you’d have to jump through extra steps to edit the URL like you might on the desktop version of Safari.
* FirstEditBookmark is a new jailbreak tweak that solves this issue. It allows you to edit the URL of a bookmark prior to saving it to your favorites.
* FirstEditBookmark is a simple enough tweak, and contains no options or settings to configure. After installation, you’ll notice the the URL field is now editable, where it wasn’t before.

* You can now edit URLs before saving the bookmark
* With the evolution of iOS and the adoption of share and action extensions, editing bookmarks isn’t as popular as it once was on iOS. Still, it’s nice to be able to modify the URL of our bookmarks before saving. It eliminates an extra step in the event that you do wish to edit a bookmark in mobile Safari.
* What do you think?
