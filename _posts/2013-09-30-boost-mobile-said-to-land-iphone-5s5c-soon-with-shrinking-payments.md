* Not to be outdone by fellow prepaid telco Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile is said to soon start carrying Apple’s iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c handsets. According to EVLeaks, the Irvine, California headquartered Boost Mobile should start selling both new iPhones soon on its no-contract unlimited monthly plan with Shrinking Payments.
* Again, Boost is a prepaid carrier so they’ll be likely selling full-price, unsubsidized handsets with plans probably starting at around $50 per month, decreasing every six months until the plan pricing hits $35…
* EVLeaks tweeted out the press image top of post, accompanied by the “they’re coming” message. The teaser image does not indicate whether or not Boost Mobile has plans to offer the iPhone 4s as well.
* Boost Mobile has 4G network and is a Sprint property, so expect those iPhone 5s/5c units to be CDMA devices. Note that EVLeaks is a very reliable source which leaks information pertaining to the upcoming devices.
* Now, Boost Mobile was supposed to start carrying prepaid iPhone 5 last year, but the rumor never came true. EVLeaks in April 2013 hinted that the iPhone will be going prepaid on Boost Mobile “later this year”.
* The carrier’s $50 a month plan includes unlimited talk, text and data and comes with Shrinking Payments, allowing folks to pay their bills on time in order to reduce their monthly costs each month.
* According to today’s rumor, Shrinking Payments will work with the new iPhones.

* Last week, nine regional United States wireless carriers announced October 1 iPhone 5s/5c availability as Tim Cook & Co. work around the clock to bring the new handsets to as many carriers as quickly as possible.
* Fellow prepaid wireless provider, Virgin Mobile – also owned by Sprint – was quick to tease contract-free iPhone 5s/5c on its website. Not only will Boost Mobile be competing with Virgin Mobile, but other prepaid carriers that have been carrying iPhones for quite some time, including Cricket and Walmart’s Straight Talk.
* The nation’s #2 telco AT&T this summer acquired Cricket’s parent, Leap Wireless for $1.2 billion.
