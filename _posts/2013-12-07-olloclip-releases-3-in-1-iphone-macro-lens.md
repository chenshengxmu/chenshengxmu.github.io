* Olloclip just released a new 3-in-1 Macro Lens for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s.
* While the lenses themselves are made of coated glass multi-element optics, the barrels are made of anodized aircraft grade aluminum. As with its other lens kits, these macro lenses connect to the iPhone thanks to soft plastic material that will ensure a secure fit while preventing any damage to your iPhone.
* These lenses offer three magnifications in one, allowing you to take close-up shots. The three included lenses are 7x, 14x and 21x macros…
* Maybe the most interesting feature of this 3-in-1 lens is the InstaFocus Hood made from a translucent plastic designed to diffuse the light and get the exact focusing distance with every use. If you’ve taken macro photos with your iPhone before, you know how focus can be tricky. This InstaFocus Hood should make it a bit easier.
* As always, the Olloclip 3-in-1 Macro Lens doesn’t come cheap, but iPhoneography enthusiasts shouldn’t rebuke. The 3-in-1 iPhone Macro Lens is available for pre-order from the Olloclip website for $69.99. We were told by the folks at Olloclip that pre-orders are expected to ship on December 15th.
* The Olloclip 3-in-1 Macro Lens works with iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, and also includes an adapter to fit the fifth generation iPod touch.
* Get it from Olloclip today.
