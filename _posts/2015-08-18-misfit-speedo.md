* Misfit, the maker of wearable activity trackers, and swimwear company Speedo today announced they partnered up to create a new Shine activity tracker designed to count swim laps, because step counting is so 2014.
* The all-new ‘Speedo Shine’ is basically a special version of the company’s ‘Shine’ fitness tracking wearable which caters to swimmers. Waterproofed to 50 meters, the device uses proprietary lap counting algorithms with “industry-leading accuracy” and launches on September 1 exclusively through Apple Stores.
* Designed like a smartwatch with a circular face, the Misfit Speedo Shine sits on your wrist and employs a range of sensors and clever algorithms to count laps for all stroke types. Its built-in battery provides up to six months of run time, Misfit claims.

* Made from aluminum, the gadget works with Misfit’s iOS app which gives you deep insight into your swimming performance, including laps and distance swam, calories burned and more. Data that the device records is synced with the iOS app via Bluetooth.
* “The new Speedo Shine also allows swimmers to take this information and seamlessly add it to their wider fitness data, providing an accurate and complete view of their total health and fitness regime,” explains Jamie Cornforth, Speedo’s VP of product and marketing.

* In addition to Misfit iOS app syncing, the gadget will soon gain the ability to sync with the Speedo Fit app.
* In addition to counting laps, the new accessory also counts steps taken, tracks your sleep and a range of other activities and exercises. The accuracy and reliability of tracking swimming activity has been tested at Speedo’s Aqualab, the companies assure.
* The new Misfit Speedo Shine will be available beginning September 1 through Apple’s retail stores, on Misfit’s website and on Speedo’s webstore. The device is available in a new anodized Pure Silver color option and will ship with both a black and white band and clasp.
* The included Action Clip allows you to wear the Speedo Shine like a regular watch, or you can use it as a clip-on wearable device.
* The Speedo Shine is priced at $79.99.
* Earlier this summer, Misfit launched an inexpensive $20 Flash Link activity tracker, rolled out a new Link iOS app and refreshed its main iOS app with new features.
