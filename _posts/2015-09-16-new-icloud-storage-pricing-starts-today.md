* Despite an earlier report coming from Reddit that Apple’s new iCloud Storage pricing would go live on September 25th, the same day of the iPhone 6s launch, Apple has launched its updated iCloud storage pricing plans today.
* In my opinion, this makes more sense, as iCloud is more aligned with the software, and iOS 9 just went live as well. Apple has updated its iCloud storage pricing page with the updated prices for its three cloud storage tiers, and has also introduced new international pricing for iCloud storage.
*  
* Along with the new prices, Apple has simplified its iCloud pricing strategy. Now there are just three tiers, and they are as follows:
* 50 GB: $0.99 200 GB: $2.99 1 TB: $9.99
* The cheapest tier, the $0.99 tier, now receives over 50% more storage than before. Apple dropped the 500 GB tier, and lowered the price of its 200GB and 1TB tier. The 200GB tier used to go for $3.99 a month and the 1TB tier used to run $19.99.
* iCloud storage is now much more affordable, which is great news for those of you upgrading to higher pixel density iPhone 6s’ capable of shooting 6+ MB/s 4K videos.
* What if you purchased a monthly iCloud storage plan before the update? Here’s what Apple has to say about the matter:
* If you purchased a monthly plan before September 16, 2015, your account was upgraded automatically. If you’re currently on an annual plan, you’ll continue to renew annually at that rate. If you select a new monthly plan, your annual plan won’t be available to you.
* International users outside of the U.S. should also check Apple’s updated page for iCloud storage pricing. Apple including pricing for multiple regions, including North America, South America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.
* The new plans appear to be rolling out now for most users. Which plan are you expecting to use?
