* Taking a cue from the jailbreak community, Apple has added the ability to update your social networking accounts from directly within iOS 6‘s Notification Center.
* Using two new buttons in NC, users will be able to post new status updates to Facebook, and new tweets to Twitter, all without ever leaving the drop-down menu…
* This is great news, for both Twitter and Facebook users, who previously had to perform a tedious routine to post updates — launch the application, open the Update dialogue box and type their text.
* Of course, jailbroken users have had a number of options for posting updates to Facebook and Twitter from anywhere in iOS for quite some time now. Tweaks like Twitkafly, Activator, and Fusion all come to mind.
