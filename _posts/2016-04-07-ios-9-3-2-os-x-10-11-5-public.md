* Apple today seed the first betas of upcoming iOS and OS X updates to public testers. Folks in the Beta Software Program can now install iOS 9.3.2 via OTA on their iOS devices, and OS X 10.11.5 via the App Store Software Update mechanism.
* These are the same betas that Apple pushed out to developers yesterday, along with updates for watchOS and tvOS. They arrive two weeks after the public releases of iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4, which brought about several user-facing changes.
* Looking at the release notes for the first betas, 9.3.2 and 10.11.5 are expected to be more minor updates, with more under-the-hood changes such as bug fixes and performance improvements. We’ll update this post if any other changes are found.
