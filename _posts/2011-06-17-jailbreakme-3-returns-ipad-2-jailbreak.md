* After Comex teased that the iPad 2 jailbreak is “almost ready,” a rumor has started circulating that the famed jailbreak site, JailbreakMe.com, will return today with the long-awaited jailbreak for the iPad 2.
* According to Nexus404, the above image briefly appeared on Comex’s Twitter account last night, but the image link was almost immediately pulled. Comex has been working on an iPad 2 jailbreak for quite some time, and this image could be a teaser he created and published prematurely…
* An iFans forum poster tells the story of finding this image,
* “I was on comex’s Twitter about an hour ago when he posted a single image link. I was surprised to see it was what appears to be a flyer for his new jailbreak? When I reloaded the Twitter page it was gone completely. I still had the image in another tab, though, so I saved it to my computer. Perhaps this wasn’t intended to get out yet or maybe there was a delay? I don’t know, I’m just looking at the image unsure if he’s really intending to release it tomorrow or not. This is certainly weird.”
* Before we speculate any farther, it’s important to remember that this teaser could be entirely fake. It’s a little suspicious that no one was able to grab a screenshot of Comex’s tweet with this link before it was pulled.
* Comex has been known to tease his projects, as is evidenced by the current image that recently displayed when you visited www.jailbreakme.com.

* We already told you how that image means that Comex has found a PDF exploit for what we believe to be the iPad 2. Interestingly, this image has been pulled from www.jailbreakme.com. Instead, the FAQ for JailbreakMe 2.0 is now displayed on the site’s homepage. Comex is obviously gearing up for a new release.
* The tiny line of text under the date in the teaser image reads, “iPad2jailbrokenforlife.” If that is true, our previous speculation is correct that Comex’s jailbreak is at the hardware level – making it impossible for Apple to patch the exploit in iOS 5.
* As AppAdvice points out, the QR code at the bottom right links back to Comex’s Twitter account, and the iPad 2 image on the left corner clearly states what device this jailbreak is for. JailbreakMe 3.0 will be a userland jailbreak, meaning that you’ll be able to jailbreak the iPad 2 straight from Mobile Safari, without needing to plug into a desktop computer.
* If this rumor is to be believed, a userland jailbreak for the iPad 2 will be made available today at 6:17:11 PM GMT.
* We don’t have any inside information on this news, and we have to remain skeptical. If an iPad 2 jailbreak is released tonight, today will be a huge day for the jailbreak community. As always, stay tuned to iDB for the latest, breaking news on this story.
* Do you guys think this teaser is a hoax?
* UPDATE: When something looks too good to be true, it usually is. This teaser image has been proved fake. For more information, check here.
* Sorry for posting misleading information.
