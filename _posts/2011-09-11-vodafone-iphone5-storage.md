* An interesting little tidbit this Sunday morning, and as is so often the case recently, it’s more iPhone 5 news. This particular story comes courtesy of one of the UK’s largest carriers, Vodafone.
* A product listing on Vodafone UK’s website appears to have dropped the bombshell that the iPhone 5 will come in 16GB and 32GB flavors only, meaning no 64GB storage bump this time around…
* The product in question is Vodafone’s Sure Signal unit, which is built to extend Vodafone’s coverage in more signal areas. The product’s web page has a list of compatible products, and there you would have found listings for the iPhone 5 in 16GB and 32GB models, and in black and white. We say would, because if you hit the page now, all mention of the iPhone 5 has been removed. A smoking gun, perhaps?
* Also worth noting is the inclusion of both colors, meaning none of the crazy delays just for a spot of white paint this time around.
* None of this really means anything of course, with Apple expected to hold an announcement event sooner rather than later, and an early-October release date very much looking on the cards.
* Just a couple more weeks of rumors, hopefully!
