* Apple tonight posted two new TV commercials to its YouTube channel showcasing the recently-launched iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The spots are entitled ‘Gamers’ and ‘Reservations,’ and the first demonstrates the gaming power of the new A8 processor, while the latter shows off the new Continuity feature in iOS 8.
* Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and recording artist Justin Timberlake return for both adverts, which are shot in a similar fashion to recent iPhone 6 ads. The camera zooms in on a pair of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets, and the duo provide comedic voiceovers as they demonstrate various phone and iOS features.

* The game in the ‘Gamers’ ad is Vainglory, a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) title that Apple used to showcase its new A8 processor and Metal technology at its September iPhone event. And in the second ad, the duo demonstrate how to make phone calls from non-iPhone devices using Continuity.
* What do you think of the new commercials?
