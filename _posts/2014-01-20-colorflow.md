* ColorFlow is a recently released jailbreak tweak that colorizes the look of the stock Music app. The colors impact nearly every facet of the stock Music app, from the buttons, to the sliders; even the backgrounds aren’t spared.
* The colors are inspired and derived from the currently playing album artwork. ColorFlow is a gorgeous looking tweak that’s a must try for iOS 7 jailbreakers. Have a look at our full video walkthrough after the jump.
* The thing that I like about ColorFlow is that it just works when you install it. There are no options or settings to configure; just install it, and start playing your favorite songs via the stock Music app.
* The effect is best seen with album artwork that features vivid colors, but I think that the stock Music app benefits greatly regardless. If you want to try ColorFlow, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it can be had for $1.99.
* Developer, David Goldman, did a fine job putting this tweak together. Let me know what you think in the comment section below.
