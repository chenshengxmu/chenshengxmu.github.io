* Pangu for iOS 8 caught us all by surprise, but it shouldn’t be a shock that the talented Chinese jailbreak team pulled off a jailbreak in such a short period of time since iOS 8’s release. While the Pangu tool for iOS 8 isn’t exactly ideal as far as a consumer jailbreak goes—it doesn’t come bundled with Cydia, it’s in Chinese, and it’s Windows only—it’s certainly better than nothing.
* In this video tutorial, we will show you how to jailbreak iOS 8.1 using Pangu 1.0.1 with a Windows machine. It’s an extremely easy and simple process, as long as you follow the steps exactly. This tool can jailbreak the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and any other device capable of running iOS 8.x. Check out our full video tutorial for the details.
* Note, this jailbreak does not install Cydia yet. Check back for the Cydia tutorial.
* Step 1: Perform a fresh restore of iOS 8.1 on your device with iTunes

* Step 4: Install iTunes on your Windows machine, and ensure that iTunes recognizes your iOS device when you connect it to your computer. This is vital.
