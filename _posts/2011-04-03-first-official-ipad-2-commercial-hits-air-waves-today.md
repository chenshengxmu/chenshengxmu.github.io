title: First Official iPad 2 Commercial Hits Air Waves
---
* Although we’ve brought you iPad 2 videos before, they were obviously pokes at the famous Cupertino commercials and not the real deal. Apple’s marketing team has been relatively quiet about the iPad 2, until now. Yesterday, the first official iPad 2 commercial hit the air waves.
* In typical Apple fashion it was simple, elegant, and to the point. The 30 second spot showed off some popular iPad 2 apps like Garage Band and iBooks, but what really stood out was the commentary.
* In what appears to be a nod to puzzled competitors, the voice over vaguely reveals Apple’s secret to the iPad’s success.
* “Faster, thinner, lighter, those are all good things. But when technology gets out of the way, everything becomes more delightful, even magical. That’s when you leap forward.”
* While other companies are worried about the technical specs, Apple is after the best end user experience. This explains why tablets such as the Motorola Xoom are experiencing dismal sales.
* If you market your product with buzz words like dual core and megapixels, you are pitching to a small audience that actually cares about hardware specs. That’s why Apple uses magical in their commercials, it appeals to more people.
* Check the commercial out below. What do you think?
