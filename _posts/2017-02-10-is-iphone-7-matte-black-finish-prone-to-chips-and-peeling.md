* Has the anodized finish on your matte black iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus started to chip or peel off? You’re probably not alone. As evidenced by user posts in a multi-page thread on Apple’s support forum, a growing number of people are complaining that their matte black Apple smartphone is showing paint chips around its edges, even with the use of a case.
* Does this feel like ScuffGate all over again?
* It would seem that iPhone 7 Plus model are more prone to scuffs, nicks and scratches than their smaller non-Plus counterparts, which may or may not be explained by their larger surface area. Several users wrote that Apple Support was unable to help them or replace their device, dismissing the issue as an uncovered cosmetic flaw.
* “I’ve bought my iPhone 7 Plus and after 3 weeks the paint started peeling near the right speakers,” one poster wrote. “I have contacted Apple care and they asked to send a few images of the problem and after 12 days they told me it is not covered under warranty since it is under cosmetic damage.”
* “I was at an Apple Store complaining about it but they didn’t know how to classify my case so I didn’t get a new phone for free,” wrote another user, adding that the photos of the phone he sent to the support hotline were passed to the engineers in California.
* “I’m waiting for feedback,” he wrote.
* While some posters reported chips on the back portion near the Apple logo, it appears that the area around the speaker grille at the device bottom, as well as the corners of the volume button, are most susceptible to chipping. That’s a bit strange because the speaker grille is one of the least used surface areas of the device.

* Although the Cupertino company does caution that glossy Jet Black iPhone 7 devices may be prone to fine micro-abrasions with use, even advising that customers use a case, it’s interesting that Apple did not provide a similar disclaimer about mate black iPhone 7 models or other iPhone 7 colorways.
* This problem is likely occurring with other iPhone 7 colors though the handset’s natural silver color exposed due to chipping is most visible on black-clad devices.
* It’s unclear how widespread the issue is. I’m hoping Apple will recognize the matter as soon as possible and offer a solution, but am not optimistic since cosmetic flaws and defects stemming from daily use are not covered by Apple’s standard 1-year warranty.
* Recall, if you will, how the Internet exploded in 2012 with reports of scratches, dings and nicks occurring on Black and Slate iPhone 5 models, with disgruntled users reporting chipping and scuffing issues mere days after purchasing the handset.
* The media blew the problem out of proportion, prompting Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller to respond by saying that any aluminum product might scratch or chip with use.
* “That is normal,” he said.
* ScuffGate was put to rest after a fresh batch of devices shipping a few weeks later were no longer plagued by the issue. It is generally thought that bubbles built up in the anodized finish of early-launch Black and Slate iPhone 5 models due to rushed production, causing the paint to break and develop visible cracks.
* Do these reports of matte black iPhone 7 models being allegedly prone to chips and peeling feel to you as one of these recurring things with no real issue?
* Sound off in the comments.
