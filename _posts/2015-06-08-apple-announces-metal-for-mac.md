* Among the many improvements Apple’s Craig Federighi announced for OS X El Capitan, is the addition of Metal. Launched on iOS 8 last year, Metal provides the lowest-overhead access to the GPU, enabling you to maximize the graphics and compute potential of apps and games.
* With a streamlined API, precompiled shaders, and support for multi-threading, Metal has up to 40% greater rendering efficiency than standalone OpenGL. “Metal combines the compute power of OpenCL and the graphics power of OpenGL in a high-performance API that does both.”
* Federighi adds that Adobe has agreed to adopt Metal in its creativity suite of apps, where it will provide a 10x improvement in draw call performance and 8x improvement in AfterEffects. Epic was also brought up to the stage to demonstrate what Metal can do for future games.
* Metal debuts in OS X El Capitan, which will be available later today to developers and this fall to the general public.
