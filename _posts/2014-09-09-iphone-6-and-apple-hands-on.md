* So you’ve watched Apple’s keynote, and you’ve been keeping up with the news today, but thus far you’ve only seen the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch from either afar or in marketing materials. Sure, the products look good in rendered photos, but what do they look like up close and personal?
* Select journalists were given the chance to go hands on with the aforementioned products after the event today, and have posted videos of their initial reactions. So naturally, we’ve rounded up some of those clips of folks trying out the iPhone 6, Apple Pay and Apple Watch for you below.

* Obviously these are just initial impressions, gleaned from a short amount of time with each product in a very controlled environment, so opinions could change in the coming weeks. Real world usage is a whole different ballgame—particularly for items like the Apple Pay service and Apple Watch.
* The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus go on sale next week, and you can learn more about them here. Apple says it plans to launch Apple Pay by mid October here in the US; more on the service here. And finally, Apple Watch won’t be available until early 2015, but you can read more about it here.
