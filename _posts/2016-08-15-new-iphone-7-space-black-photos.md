* Dummies produced by third parties previously hinted at what an Apple Watch Space Black-like colorway reportedly in tow for the next iPhone might look like. Such photos are as fine as plasticky dummies go, but there’s nothing quite like seeing the real aluminum unibody construction with Apple fit and finish.
* Leaked out of China and discovered by Dutch blog TechTastic.nl, the latest batch of photographs presumably taken inside a Foxconn factory give us our best look yet at the rumored Space Black finish for the iPhone 7.
* It’s unclear if these new photographs were leaked out by the same source who snapped up images of an alleged iPhone 7 Plus aluminum casing inside a Foxconn factory, seen below, but they certainly look like it judging from a person’s fingernails.

* Are you guys excited about the Space Black-like (or Deep Blue?) color option replacing the existing Space Gray colorway in the iPhone 7 lineup?
