* If you prefer watching news footage over reading articles, don’t pass on a brand new app from Reuters, a global news-gathering organization owned by Thomson Reuters.
* Their free Reuters TV for iOS app just went live in the App Store, bringing you personalized video news when you want it, straight from the source and made to fit your day.
* Offering both on-demand and live news programming and reportage from over 2,500 journalists in 200 countries, Reuters TV is personalized (swipe to skip the stories that don’t interest you), highly customizable (you can set your preferred show length) and relevant (news is tailored to your location).
* The app is broken down into two distinct sections: Reuters Now and Live Feeds. A customized stream of relevant reportage, Reuters Now offers insightful coverage of national and international news.
* Live Feeds, on the other hand, is your window into the world events as they unfold, in the form of live footage “with beautifully unfiltered coverage” and custom notifications for the stories that interest you.
* Some videos contain short and unobtrusive ads.
* Reuters Now has offline support, is tailored to your interests and location and even permits you to set the preferred length of your news show, ranging from five to thirty minutes.
* Live Feeds is a subscription-based service starting at $2 per month via Apple’s In-App Purchase mechanism.
