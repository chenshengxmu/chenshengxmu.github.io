* Apple has shared some cumulative end-of-the-year lists for best performing iOS apps of 2014. The lists, which have been posted in the App Store, include top paid apps for iPhone and iPad, top free apps for iPhone and iPad, and the top grossing apps for iPhone and iPad.
* There aren’t too many surprises here, with familiar names like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat ranking high. Still, it’s interesting to see which titles had major success this year, and which ones didn’t. Below you’ll find the top 10 apps from each of the categories.

* In addition the above collections, Apple also published lists of its favorite apps, games and other content from iTunes earlier this month. It’s also hosting a gigantic sale in iTunes right now, significantly discounting a number of high profile apps, movies and music albums.
