* Google’s YouTube app provides many obvious shortcuts and not-so-obvious ones that are hidden from plain sight. For example, you can stop “Up Next” videos from autoplaying or skip forward and back ten seconds to catch something you missed by double-tapping on either side of the video player.
* In today’s brief tutorial, you’ll learn how to browse other clips in YouTube’s fullscreen mode without interrupting the currently playing video.
* 1) Make sure that a copy of the YouTube app on your device has a version number 12.06.11 or later. You can see the app’s version number by tapping your profile icon, then choose Settings from the list.

* The current version number can be found next to Version at the bottom of the screen.
* 2) Tap on any video to begin playback, then enter fullscreen mode by hitting the icon in the lower-right corner of the video player. Alternatively, turn the device upside down to enter fullscreen mode (if that doesn’t work, toggle Orientation Lock in Control Center).
* 3) Simply swipe up in fullscreen mode to pull up thumbnails of recommended videos from the channel you’re currently watching and other channels you’re subscribed to.

* You can scroll the thumbnails horizontally while the current clip is playing, swipe down to hide the carousel or tap outside to make both it and other controls go away.
* And that’s it, you now know how to browse other videos in YouTube’s fullscreen mode.
* Unfortunately, the most useful YouTube features like background play and offline support are available only to those who would subscribe to YouTube Red, a $10 a month value.
