* An alleged employee writes on Reddit that Amazon’s Prime Video app for the fourth-generation Apple TV and the new Apple TV 4K is launching Thursday, October 26.
* Here’s the Reddit post in its entirety:
* Some of you will remember my post a little while back, in which I warned that Amazon would not launch until at least October 26. We’re now just about two weeks from the 26th, and the app is still on track to launch that day. In my time at this job, I have never once seen a release slip this close to a scheduled launch. I am very confident in saying that the 26th is finally the day.
* Two weeks ago, the poster used the same throwaway account named “AmazonVideoEngineer” to report that “the app is done, and has been done for months already.”
* “There are a lot of politics going on beyond my pay grade that are pushing the launch back,” the message said. “And just to clarify, October 26 is the earliest I would expect it.”
* He added that the launch could be pushed “well into November.”
* Take this report with a grain of salt.
* The listing for the new Apple TV 4K that appeared briefly on amazon.com was soon taken down. Apple announced back in June that Prime Video would be coming to its set-top box.
