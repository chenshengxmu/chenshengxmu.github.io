* Apple could be holding an Apple TV-related media event next month, according to Jeffries analyst Peter Misek. Despite the mounting rumors that Apple is working on a standalone television set, channel checks led the analyst to believe that the assumed event will serve as a launchpad for a software development kit allowing programmers to write third-party applications for Apple’s $99 set-top box, something a lot of people have been clamoring for…
* By the way, you should know that the well-connected Jim Dalrymple of The Loop shot down the March event analyst prediction with a proverbial “nope”.
* Misek wrote in a note to clients, obtained by MacRumors:
* Channel checks indicate Apple has a product event in March that is Apple-TV related (possibly an iTV SDK introduction). We think a Sep/Oct iTV launch is being targeted.
* Coincidentally or not, the ‘Apple TV3,2’ string discovered in iOS 6.1 seem to point to a tweaked Apple TV being on its way.
* Apple commented by saying that “we sometimes make component changes which require an updated model number for regulatory approval”.
* The component changes we made don’t affect product features and Apple TV customers will continue to have the same great user experience.
* In that regard, the next Apple TV could easily sport a faster processor and graphics in order to run full-screen 1080p apps and games.
* As fort the iTV, Misek anticipates that Apple will offer the product in screen sizes ranging betweet 42 and 55 inches, with prices starting around $1,500.
* Misek also wrote in his note today that supply chain sources told him that iPhone 5 sales are decelerating as Apple has apparently cut its build orders to thirty million iPhones, down from forty million units.
* Misek thinks that’s a sign of a seasonal drop off in iPhone demand as suppliers are “prepping for iPhone 5S builds to start in March.”
