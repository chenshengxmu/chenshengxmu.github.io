* In a somewhat bizarre move, Apple supplier LG Display may have inadvertently leaked Apple’s unannounced iMac whopping an 8K Retina screen, writing on its website last week that, I’m quoting, “Apple has also announced that they will release the ‘iMac 8K’ with a super-high resolution display later this year”.
* Apple, of course, has not publicly announced plans for a new iMac update. LG Display is Apple’s important supplier of desktop and mobile screens and the Cupertino company is known to have cut off suppliers who pre-announced its products. Neither LG nor Apple commented on the matter at post time.
* LG’s document explains that its new 8K panel dubbed “Quad Ultra-High Definition” is the future of display technology, noting that it’s “become clear” that Japan is planning to launch an 8K SHV test broadcast and then “promptly restructure” its UHD service.
* “Korea is also preparing to offer an 8K service demonstration at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,” said LG.

* “LG Display displayed a new beacon of the 8K era by revealing their 98-inch 8K Color Prime Ultra HDTV at CES 2015,” reads the document. The TV uses IPS, a premium display technology for wide viewing angles and boasts a screen brightness of 500nit by adding a white pixel to the existing RGB sub-pixel structure.
* An iMac with an 8K screen would max out at a whopping 7,680-by4,320 pixel resolution. Compared to a 4K resolution of 3,840-by-2,160 pixels, LG’s Quad Ultra-High Definition panel has two times the 4K screen resolution, or four times the number of pixels.
* Apple’s 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display debuted last fall, featuring an LCD IPS screen with a display resolution of 5,120‑by‑2,880 pixels, good for 14.7 million pixels.
