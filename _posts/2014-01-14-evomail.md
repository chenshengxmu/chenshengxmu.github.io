title: Evomail+ launches as a brand new app and it’s free
---
* Last May, we took a look at Evomail for the iPad. At its launch, the app was pretty clean and worked well, but lacked features, wasn’t available for anything other than Gmail, and carried a three dollar price tag.

* The app saw a lot of updates, including support for the iPhone, additional mail client integration, and a price drop to free. However, things were still not totally solid with the user interface.
* Today, the company has completely redesigned the app with a better user interface, customizable gestures, and cloud-based sharing options. The app is so different that, instead of making it an update, the company has re-launched it as Evomail+…
* Evomail+ now features a one-button control option, which lets users reply and forward emails with one central button. It adapts to fit with the situation to allow users to faster navigate inbox and messages.

* The app also now comes with EvoCloud, which improves push notification and cleans out the bugs from the previous app. EvoCloud checks for new messages automatically, in real-time.
* If you are sending stored files, you can easily access documents from Dropbox or Box.net right from within your email draft.
* Customizable gestures allow you set the parameters of your movements. Swipe to the right to read or swipe to the left to delete. It’s up to you what your actions do.
* When you are on the go, Evomail+ makes it easy to keep your inbox clean by giving you access to archive, trash, and labels. Move your email to its designated area wherever you are so that it stays clean, even when you are away from your desktop.
* You can also “Snooze” your emails by temporarily sending them away until you are free to read them later. Use the built-in full access Gmail search to find new and archived Gmail messages for quick access to old conversations.

* Dynamic Evomail+ also supports background syncing, external keyboard support, and text so you can customize your email experience from top to bottom.
* Unlike Evomail, this app is launching only on the iPhone. Presumably, iPad support will be available in the future. The app supports Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, and IMAP email accounts.
* Evomail+ is available for free. Download it in the App Store today.
* Are you excited about the new version of Evomail? Will you download it?
