* Just as was predicted earlier this month, Apple rolled out its latest handset to several new countries today. Even though the company didn’t make an official announcement in advance, its website now reflects the additional regions.
* The iPhone 4S launched here in the states back in October, along with a handful of other countries. Since then, Apple has been speedily rolling out the popular device to new areas on a month by month basis. So who got it today?
* According to MacRumors, the iPhone 4S just launched in: Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Peru, the Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.
* In Brazil, the new iPhone starts at R$2599 (about $1410 US). And in Russia, the entry-level 4S costs RUB$43,154 (about $1131 US). Compare that to just $199 here in the states.
* Pricing aside, this is Apple’s fastest product rollouts we’ve ever seen. Which is a good thing considering they’re looking to sell in upwards of 30 million handsets this quarter. It’ll be interesting to see where the company is at when the dust settles.
