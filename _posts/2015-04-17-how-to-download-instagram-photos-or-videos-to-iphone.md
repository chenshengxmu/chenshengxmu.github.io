title: How to download Instagram photos or videos to iPhone
---
* Instagram has a fantastic community of photographers, with some of them more gifted than others. Every once in a while, I’ll see a photo or video on Instagram that I want to save to my iPhone for later viewing, or simply because I find it interesting.
* The problem is Instagram doesn’t let you save photos or videos from within the app. I’m not completely sure why this isn’t an option, but I’d argue that copyright laws may have something to do with that, along with the fact that Instagram wants you to use the app rather than download photos directly to your iPhone.
* With that said, there are of course ways you can download Instagram videos or photos to your iPhone. While using jailbreak tweaks is an option, we’ll focus on an App Store app that allows you to save content from Instagram to your iPhone.
* There are literally dozens of apps in the App Store that let you save photos and videos from Instagram to your iPhone. The good news is most of them are free. The bad news is they usually contain in-app purchases, tons of ads, and aren’t always the best looking apps. But whatever works…
* I’ve gone through several of them, and I keep coming back to the same one as it seems to offer the best experience. In this post, I will show you how to save photos and videos from Instagram using Regrammer.
* Step 1: Download Regrammer for free.
* Step 2: In the Instagram app, find the photo or video you want to download, then tap on the Share icon that looks like ” … ” above the photo, and select Copy Link.

* Step 3: Launch the Regrammer app and paste the link you just copied into the box, then hit Preview.

* Step 4: Tap on the Repost button.
* Step 5: Tap on the More option. This will open the Share sheet. From there you can select Save Image to save the photo or video to your Camera Roll.

* As I mentioned above, there is a plethora of apps to save content from Instagram, and they’re not all really pretty, or even updated for the larger screen iPhones, but they do get the job done.
* Most of these apps operate on a coin-based system to let you download content, where it costs one coin to download one photo or video. When you first download the app, you are given four free coins, but if you want more, you will have to watch ads to earn them. Regrammer doesn’t work like this and is entirely free to use although it is ad-supported.
* If your iPhone is jailbroken, there are different tweaks you can download from Cydia to let you save pictures and videos from Instagram to your iPhone. InstaBetter, InstaEnhancer, Instagram++, and InstaTools are just a few of the many options available.
