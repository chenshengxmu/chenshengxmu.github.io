* Steve Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson is considering adding more content to his already-released book on Apple’s late co-founder and former CEO.
* The book originally went on sale not long after the iconic Jobs’ death, but with so many questions left unanswered and some pundits suggesting that the book misses important events from the man’s life, Isaacson has admitted that he may well need to add more content to his already-lengthy book.
* In fact, during an interview with Fortune, Isaacson went so far as to call the best-seller a “first draft,” which we are sure will no doubt not please everyone who spent their hard-earned money on it.
* “One possibility is doing an extensively annotated version. Another is writing an addendum that addresses the period surrounding Jobs’ death. Fleshing out the details seems like a logical next step, since Isaacson believes the Apple CEO’s story will be told for decades or a century to come. “This is the first or second draft,” he said, referring to his book’s role in documenting Jobs’ life. “It’s not the final draft.”
* For a first draft the book did exceedingly well, becoming Amazon’s best-selling print book of 2011 as well as being the online retailer’s best-selling new release of the year when print and digital sales are combined. Hopefully those of us with Kindle editions will get the book updated free of charge, but what about everyone who bought the paper version?
* With Steve Jobs being such a celebrity in tech circles, it is entirely possible people would buy the book all over again if it meant learning more about a man that almost single handedly saved Apple in the late 1990s, turning it into the giant that it is today.
