* The Nest Learning Thermostat is one of those products that makes it finally feel like we’re living in the future that we envisioned as children. One step below Jetsons level tech, the Nest harbors contemporary tech in a pseudo-retro styled metal and plastic body that’s a bit unassuming, if not altogether ironic.
* When you sit and contemplate about what the Nest is doing, it doesn’t seem all that groundbreaking, especially considering some of the advancements in technology that we’ve witnessed over the last decade. The wow factor comes from the fact that the creators of Nest found an industry that didn’t dare veer far from the status quo, and essentially turned it upside down…
* Give credit to former Apple engineer and iPod creator, Tony Fadell, who leads the team at Nest. It’s no coincidence that Fadell headed up the creation of the iconic iPod while tenured at Apple, and it shows in nearly every facet of the Nest experience. From the packaging and unboxing, to the build quality, to the click wheel — this is the thermostat that Cupertino would have created if they were into that sort of thing.

* Thankfully someone was into that sort of thing, because walls worldwide have been begging to get these ugly contraptions off of them for decades. Up until now, even if you wanted to have something a bit more functional than your average rock, you were just left wanting. Now we have a choice, and as you will no doubt see, having a choice is a wonderful thing.
* At this point if you were to ask for my recommendation, I’d say walk, no, run to your nearest computer and order a device if you can afford to do so. The Nest isn’t something you need by any means of the imagination, but it’s so much better looking than thermostats of yesteryear, and so much more functional, that I don’t see how anyone could regret the price even at $249.

* I’ll be back with a more in-depth look at the Nest’s free iOS app, the lauded learning capability, and more, once I’ve had some adequate time to put the Nest through its paces. I also plan on completing my installation by patching up a few of the holes left over by my old thermostat. Until then, check out our unboxing video, and let us know if you’d consider dropping $249 to bless your walls with this incredibly functional work of art.
