* Amazon is exploring the creation of a live, streaming television service, reports Bloomberg. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says the online retailer has reached out to major media companies including CBS and Comcast’s NBCUniversal to discuss carrying their channels.
* The talks are assumed to be in the preliminary stages. Analyst Dan Rayburn wrote on Tuesday “those I have spoken with haven’t disclosed how far along Amazon is with regards to a live OTT service.” He added that it’s possible Amazon is simply examining the economics of the business.
* Amazon of course already offers an on-demand video service, similar to those from Netflix and Hulu, and the company is quickly becoming a force in the content creation space with several original TV series. In fact, its popular show Transparent took home five Emmy Awards last month.
* All of this being said, live TV is a completely different animal. Not only is the cable TV provider space extremely crowded, but offering OTT live television service has thus far proven challenging from a technological and licensing standpoint. Just ask Dish Network’s Sling TV group and Apple.
