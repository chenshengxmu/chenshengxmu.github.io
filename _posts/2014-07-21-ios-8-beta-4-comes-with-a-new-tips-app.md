* Released earlier today, iOS 8 beta 4 came with a new stock application called Tips, which as its name suggests, is here to share tips about new features to iOS users. So far, the app offers 6 different tips but it does invite users to check back later as apparently it will be updated every week.
* As iOS is becoming a more complex operating system, the addition of this app will definitely be welcome by users that are not necessarily tech savvy. While the average iDB reader probably already knows about these tips, most users don’t. This is a good way to ensure that all users are aware of what they can do with their device, brought in a very simple and elegant manner.
* Below are the tips shared in this first edition:
* Quickly respond to a notification

* Notify when there’s a reply

* While browsing the tips, you are able to “Like” them, which apparently doesn’t do anything. Tips can also be shared via Message, mail, Twitter, or Facebook.
* Tips for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch can also be found on the web.
