title: How to show the full website address in Safari for Mac
---
* Safari has undergone some big changes beginning with OS X Yosemite, but none are perhaps as controversial as the way that website addresses are displayed in the Search bar. By default, only the domain name and TLD (e.g. idownloadblog.com) of the website address is shown. The remaining portion of the address is hidden in an effort to, as best I can guess, promote a clean looking Search bar like that of Safari on iOS.
* If cleanliness and closer look to the iOS version of Safari was indeed the motivation behind the change, then there’s no doubt that Safari’s engineers succeeded in their goal. I personally think that the Search bar looks better by hiding the full website address.
* But there’s no denying that you are giving up something by hiding the full address, and I can definitely understand why people would be upset at this. The full address can still be viewed, but it requires that you click in the Search bar to do so.
* With that in mind, Safari’s engineers have made it possible to get the full website address back into the Search bar at all times in just a simple few steps.
* To get the full website address back, do the following:
* Step 1: Open Safari
* Step 2: Click the Safari Menu → Preferences
* Step 3: Click the Advanced tab and click Show Full Website Addresses

* The full website address should now be back in the Search bar full time.
* True, you give up some of the simplicity that defines macOS’ makeover, but it’s a fine balance between simplicity and usability, and many believe that Safari crossed the line in this regard.
* What about you? Which way do you prefer?
