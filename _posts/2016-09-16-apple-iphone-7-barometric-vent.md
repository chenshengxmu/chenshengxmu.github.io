* Yesterday, we speculated that a faux speaker grille at the bottom of the iPhone 7 created by the removal of the headphone jack is for visual symmetry, based on drawings on Apple’s website and a quote from John Gruber’s iPhone 7 review. Today’s teardowns from iFixit and Chipworks hint at a new component where the headphone jack would’ve been, suspected to channel sound from outside the phone into the mic.
* Putting an end to speculation, Apple itself has gone on the record to confirm that the faux speaker grille acts as a “barometric vent.” According to the company, it’s needed after all the waterproofing to help built-in barometer sensor measure altitude accurately.
* That hunk of plastic you see top of post is the barometric vent.
* The Verge writes:
* Apparently adding all the waterproofing to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus meant that it was more of a sealed box, and so to be able to have an accurate and working barometer, Apple used that space. The barometer is the thing that allows a phone to measure altitude, and Apple points out that on the iPhone 7 it can measure even minor changes like climbing a flight of stairs.
* At least we know know for sure what the true purpose of the iPhone 7’s faux speaker grille is. Just to be sure, it also contains a second microphone, which on prior iPhones used to be a single hole to the left of the Lightning connector.
