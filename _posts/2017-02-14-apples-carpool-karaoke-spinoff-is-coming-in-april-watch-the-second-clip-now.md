* Apple wants original content and its SVP Eddy Cue is in charge of making that happen. Cue sat down last night for an interview with Peter Kafka of Recode, discussing a range of topics at the publication’s Code Media conference.
* Ben Winston, one of the producers of Apple’s upcoming Carpool Karaoke spinoff, appeared onstage as a surprise guest and played a new promotional clip for the show—just 24 hours after Apple released the first Carpool Karaoke trailer on YouTube.
* Based on the segment on “The Late Late Show” with James Corden, Apple’s version of Carpool Karaoke will have a different host every episode and feature sixteen celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing various tunes.
* Watch the new Carpool Karaoke clip below.
* Some of the celebrities confirmed for the show includes such names as Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal and others.
