* With football season over and baseball season still a month away, the US sports world has turned its attention to basketball. The regular NBA season is winding down and a lengthy stretch of playoff games is about to begin.
* With that in mind, it’s nice to see that the League continues to better its Game Time app. Following a big iOS 7 makeover and All-Star weekend refresh, the app has been updated today with videos of classic games and highlights…
* Here are the release notes for version 5.2.3:
* “Only NBA Game Time from Sprint brings you FREE unlimited live coverage of every NBA game. Sprint customers get free access to NBA Game Time Plus with live radio broadcasts, game video alerts and more. All FREE with an Unlimited data plan from Sprint.
* Classic Games – Addition of carefully selected classic games and historical videos from past seasons. New videos will be added periodically throughout the season. These are available free for all Sprint users, and users who have purchased Game Time Plus or League Pass.”
* Like the NFL app and Verizon, the NBA Game Time app has many features that are exclusive to Sprint or folks with subscriptions to Game Time Plus or League Pass. Unfortunately, that includes the new videos that were added today.
* That being said, the app still offers up non-subscribing NBA fans a lot of content and is easily the best way to track how your favorite team is doing as we head into the playoffs. NBA Game Time, for iPhone/iPad, is free in the App Store.
