* With Panorama photography mode, you can capture a 240-degree image in one shot, simply by panning your device around. By default, panoramas always start on the left so you must pan to the right. Since iOS 6, you have been able to change the direction you take panoramas in the Camera app.
* In this tutorial, I’ll demonstrate how you can quickly change the Panorama direction from the default left-to-right to right-to-left, and vice versa.
* Step 1: Launch Camera on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Swipe to the left to switch to Panorama mode.

* Step 3: To switch directions you take panoramic photos, tap the arrow button. Hit it again to revert to default left-to-right panning.

* iOS takes panoramic images through software, by capturing a series of images and smartly stitching them together to form a single high-resolution panoramic shot.
* Taking panoramic images is not supported in landscape mode, though you can kinda make a vertical panorama by turning your device upside down. Then, pan it up and down after tapping the capture button. Whatever the orientation, make sure that the arrow stays on the line as you pan around to avoid skewing the horizon.
* Panoramas are supported, in up to 43 megapixels, on the 5th and 6th-en iPod touch, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro and on any iPhone model from the iPhone 4s onward. On the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, panoramic shots are taken in up to 63 megapixels.
