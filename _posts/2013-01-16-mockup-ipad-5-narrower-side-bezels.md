* Remember ahead of last September’s iPad mini introduction, when a great deal of shabby renderings tried to depict what the device might look like?
* It wasn’t until designer Martin uit Utrecht set out to create some beautiful mockups that we started believing that the iPad mini would indeed become a smash hit for the Cupertino, California firm.
* Also behind some pretty darn accurate renderings of the then-unreleased iPhone 5, Martin’s now back at it with a bunch of new renderings done in Rhinoceros 3D, depicting what a full-size iPad 5 with the reportedly skinnier side bezels might look like. Go right past the fold for some more beautiful mockups…
* He explains that the latest iPad 5 mockup is based on his previous accurate iPad mini model, but with the iPad’s bigger 9.7-inch display in mind.

* The designer had the following rumored iPad 5 specifications in mind when creating these gorgeous renderings:
* • height: 4mm less • width: 17mm less • thickness: 2mm less
* My colleague Ed passed along earlier this morning a note by the previously-accurate KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who basically writes that the fifth iteration of the full-size iPad is due this fall with the iPad mini-like narrower side bezels. Retaining the same 9.7-inch display, the device will be “significantly lighter and slimmer” than the current-generation iPad 4, his note reads.

* If you’re a 3D artist, Martin is selling over at 3DExport this fully UV-mapped model complete with detailed bump-maps and even maps to simulate dust and fingerprints.
* For reference, this was his iPad mini mockup from last year.

* Clearly, this guy knows his trade inside out.
* And this for the iPhone 5.

* Pretty darn close, no?
* You can check out his entire portfolio on Flickr.
* And your take?
* Is the next full-size iPad gonna look anything like Martin’s concept?
