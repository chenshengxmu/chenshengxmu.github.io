* Friday, March 16, Apple sent invitations to the media and k-12 staff for an upcoming event hosted at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago. The event will be held on Tuesday, March 27 at 10:00AM local time.
* It will be a time to “hear creative new ideas for teachers and students,” according to the invitation, which exclaims “let’s take a field trip.” A calligraphy Apple logo adorns the simplistic invitation design. No doubt, there will be plenty of conversation about Apple famously existing at the crossroads of technology and liberal arts, as heralded by Steve Jobs.
* Below is a collection of Apple invitation-inspired wallpapers by iDB fan favorite @AR72104. If you aren’t following him by now, you are doing yourself a disservice. We even have a full gallery on our site, curating his work alone.
* The Wallpaper of the Week section is posted every Sunday. I scour the Internet looking for photo quality images for our favorite devices. If you have any tips, tricks, or actual images, please connect with me via @jim_gresham, where I engage the community. You can also get previews of upcoming posts and get downloads mid-week!
