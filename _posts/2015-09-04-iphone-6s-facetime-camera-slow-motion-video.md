* Earlier in the week, 9to5Mac corroborated analyst and supply chain reports that Apple’s upcoming ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ smartphones will also bring major improvements to the front-facing FaceTime camera which should go from a paltry 1.3 megapixels on current iPhones to five megapixels.
* Today, the blog said that the FaceTime camera on upcoming iPhones will feature support for selfie panoramas and slow-motion video capture. The report added that Apple is working on a keyboard accessory for an ‘iPad Pro’ and offered a few more tidbits regarding Apple’s announcements come this Wednesday.
* In addition to a substantial set of improvements on the rear-facing shooter that include a jump from eight to twelve megapixels, a sixth lens, wider aperture, better low-light sensitivity and 4K video capture, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will improve upon the front-facing FaceTime camera with these enhancements:
* Author Mark Gurman went on to explain that the device’s Force Touch screen can determine the difference between a tap, a standard press and a deep press, “adding a third level of sensitivity over the Apple Watch screen and MacBook trackpad.”
* Surprisingly, Gurman states that Fource Touch will be paired with haptic feedback to provide physical feedback to an iPhone user, with the consistency of the feedback being described as “nice.”
* As for other rumored product introductions, a next-gen $149 Apple TV will be controlled by Siri and the voice assistant will be “pegged as the premier feature” of the new device, while the current $69 box will stick around and in the future gain Apple’s upcoming cable replacement service.
* Of the mythical 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Gurman learned that this is the actual moniker of the device. “It literally looks like a big iPad,” a source told Gurman. An Apple-built stylus, bundled with the iPad Pro in box, will “not look like a traditional” one.
* The integration with the Force Touch screen will “allow the stylus and the iPad Pro to work differently based on the levels of pressure applied by the stylus to the iPad’s display.”
* Apple will also offer Smart Covers and Smart Cases for the iPad Pro and the device has been reportedly designed with “wider support for Bluetooth keyboard.” Apple is apparently reading a keyboard accessory of its own for the iPad Pro, reads the report.
* “Apple has also been working on a new multi-user mode for a future version of the iPad operating system, but it is unclear if that addition is ready to go for the iPad Pro this fall,” said Gurman.
* Are you excited about next Wednesday?
