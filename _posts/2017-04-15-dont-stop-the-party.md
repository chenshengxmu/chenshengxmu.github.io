* One of my pet peeves in terms of having a jailbroken device is how any music I’m listening to while installing tweaks on my device gets silenced with every respring. Anyone who peruses Cydia and installs tweaks a lot will find this to be a buzzkill.
* Fortunately, a new jailbreak tweak called Don’t Stop the Party! by iOS developers David Goldman and Wizages helps fix the problem once and for all by letting the music play straight through the respring process.
* After installation, you can be listen to media from any of your music apps, such as Apple Music, Pandora or Spotify, and if you respring your device, the music won’t exhibit even the slightest hiccup.
* Illustrated in the GIF example above, the music is still playing after the device comes back online after a respring. This is made evident by the fact that the play/pause button is displaying the “pause” option, which indicates that the music is already playing.
* For what it’s worth, Don’t Stop the Party! works best with apps that store music locally since apps that stream music rely on an internet connection. With that in mind, radio services like Beats 1 may experience a slight pause in playback during a respring whereas local songs in the stock Music app and cached songs in the Spotify app will not.
* This tweak is a must-have for jailbreakers in my opinion because I’ve been in these shoes so many times before, but that’s certainly subjective to the fact of whether or not you use your jailbroken device to listen to music frequently and whether or not the convenience is worth installing another tweak.
* With no options to configure and a simple goal in mind, Don’t Stop the Party! is a quick and easy fix for a problem that has existed in the jailbreak community for years, and from my testing, it works very well. I also found that it’s a much cleaner solution than a recently-released tweak called MusicMark, which only saved your place in the Music app after the respring rather than continuing the playback throughout the respring.
* If you’re interested in trying it, Don’t Stop the Party! is available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $2.00 and works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices.
* Note: A free release dubbed Don’t Stop the Party Lite is also available from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. At the cost of being free, this tweak only works with the Apple Music app and not with third-party music apps like the paid version showcased in this review does.
