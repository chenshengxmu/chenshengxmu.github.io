* Pokémon GO set an App Store record for most downloads during its first week of availability, reports The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple. This should come as no surprise to folks who have been following the craze surrounding the hit game, which has sat atop the App Store’s Top Free and Top Grossing lists since it launched earlier this month.
* With all of the press it’s received in the past couple of weeks, it will come as no surprise that Pokemon Go has been a huge success. In fact, Apple told me today that the game has set a new App Store record with more downloads in its first week than any other app in history. That is impressive.
* Apple also said that they have paid out $50 billion to developers. Again impressive, and it’s hard to even put that number into perspective.
* Debuting in the US on July 6, Pokémon GO is an augmented reality game that tasks players with tracking down Pokémon in the real world. Today’s news is just the latest in a string of achievements for the massively popular title, which has already been dubbed the “biggest mobile game in US history,” and doubled Nintendo’s market value.
