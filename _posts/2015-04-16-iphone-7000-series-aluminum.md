* Taiwan’s Economic Daily News reported Thursday that Apple will adopt 7000 Series aluminum for the next iPhone, a custom alloy the company developed for the Apple Watch Sport.
* The iPhone maker says that the 7000 Series aluminum used to make the entry-level Watch is sixty percent stronger than standard alloys but just as light, meaning the chassis of the upcoming iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus could be significantly more durable than that of the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models.
* It’s also one-third the density of stainless steel, with a special anodizing process creating a hard, clear outer layer that helps protect against scratches and corrosion. Apple has put together a nice video outlining the manufacturing process that goes into the Apple Watch Sport’s aluminum casing.

* According to Apple’s website, 7000 Series aluminum created for the Apple Watch Sport has “a bright, lustrous color and a uniform structure free of defects and impurities.”
* Each Apple Watch Sport case is machined and polished, then blasted with microscopic zirconia beads to achieve a consistent, satin texture.
* Raise hands who’s excited about the next iPhone’s materials.
