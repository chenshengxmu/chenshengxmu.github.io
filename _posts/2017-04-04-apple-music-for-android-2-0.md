* Apple today pushed a major update to the Apple Music client for Android. Available on Google’s Play Store for free, the app has been bumped from version 1.2.1 to 2.0 and now features a refreshed user interface that mimics iOS 10 styling that should bring greater clarity and simplicity.
* Aside from the facelift, the software comes with half a dozen new features including the consolidated For You, Library, Browse and Radio sections, a Now Playing screen with integrated lyrics, and more.
* Featuring bold headings, a comprehensive Library view, iOS typography, a Now Playing screen redesigned top to bottom with iOS 10-style cards and other perks, you’d be hard-pressed to distinguish it from its iPhone counterpart.
* The two things that give it away: Android’s status bar and the hamburger menu.
* The app is rated three and a half stars based on feedback from nearly 150,000 users.
* Here’s the full changelog:
* The app requires Android 4.3 and up and has seen 10-50 million installs on Android.
* New members can try Apple Music for 30 days without having their credit card charged.
* Grab Apple Music for Android free of charge on Play Store.
