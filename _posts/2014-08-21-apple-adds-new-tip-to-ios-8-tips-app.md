* Apple just updated the Tips app that is present in iOS 8, explaining users how to quickly access their favorite contacts. The update, which happened over the air, is the first such update to the Tips app since it was introduced in iOS 8 beta 4.
* This new tip explains how to take advantage of a new feature that made its way to iOS 8, with which a user can quickly access favorite and recent contacts from the App Switcher by double clicking the Home button. A list of previous Tips can be found here.
* Inside the Tips app, Apple invites people to check back for new tips every week, but this is the first new tip since the app was introduced. Hopefully this update will set a precedent and Apple will now stick to its once a week schedule.
* Thanks Matthew
