title: Apple just doubled iPhone SE storage without raising prices
---
* As part of announcing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition in a new vibrant red aluminum finish, Apple this morning said that iPhone SE, its most affordable handset ever, is now available with double the storage at the same starting price of $399 in the United States.

* The new 32 and 128-gigabyte capacities have replaced the previous 16GB and 64GB models of iPhone SE which are no longer sold. The new 32/128 GB iPhone SE models will be available beginning Friday, March 24 from apple.com and Apple Stores.
* To be perfectly clear, the new 128-gigabyte edition of iPhone SE actually brings the top-tier back to $499 because the 64-gigabyte edition it is replacing was dropped to $449 after iPhone 7 launch.
* iPhone SE features a four-inch 1,136-by-640 pixel resolution 326 ppi Retina display and largely identical design to iPhone 5s, but runs iPhone 6s-like hardware in the form of the A9 chip that also powers the new 9.7-inch iPad model, an embedded M9 motion coprocessor, NFC support for Apple Pay, the same twelve-megapixel 1.22µ pixel rear-facing camera as iPhone 6s and more. Unlike iPhone 6s, iPhone SE has a front-facing camera at just 1.2 megapixels that, however, benefits from the improved image signal processor in the A9 chip and supports the software Retina Flash feature.
* Reviewers have praised iPhone SE’s compact form factor and long battery life.
* As is its wont, Apple will treat every customer who buys iPhone SE or iPhone 7/Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Editio at one of the company’s retail stores to the free Personal Setup service to help them customize their device by setting up email, showing them new apps from App Store and more.
