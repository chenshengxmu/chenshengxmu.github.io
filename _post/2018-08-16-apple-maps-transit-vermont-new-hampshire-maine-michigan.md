* Apple Maps has expanded availability of transit directions to include select areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Michigan, according to the iOS Feature Availability webpage.
* As noted by MacRumors, Apple before today’s expansion used to offer transit directions in the city of Detroit, but now the feature has expanded across the state.
* “Transit directions are new in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine,” notes the publication. “Full transit lines are not yet being displayed in the Maps app, but the transit directions are active.”
* The Cupertino technology giant has been working hard to bring transit directions to major cities across the United States and around the world. In February 2018, transit directions expanded to South Carolina’s metropolitan areas Columbia, Charleston and Greenville.
