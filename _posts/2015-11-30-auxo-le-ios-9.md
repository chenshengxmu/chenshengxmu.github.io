* Good news for those of you who are fans of Auxo—Auxo Legacy Edition, the jailbreak tweak created via a collaboration of Ryan Petrich and Sentry, has been updated for iOS 9. As you might remember, Auxo LE was a release that was built in the image of the original version of Auxo, which was a legendary jailbreak tweak that brought a new multitasking interface to iOS.
* No new features can be expected with this latest update, but if you’re running an iOS 9 jailbreak, you’ll be happy to hear that Auxo LE should play nice with your jailbroken iPhone.
* If you’re new to Auxo, then just know that it’s one of the most popular jailbreak tweaks to ever launch on Cydia. Auxo Legacy Edition was made as a direct follow-up to the original, but it does incorporate some of the things learned from Auxo 2 and its sequel, Auxo 3.

* Auxo LE is available for $1.99 if you’re completely new to Auxo. If you own either Auxo 2 or Auxo 3, then Legacy Edition can be had for an upgrade price of only $0.99.
* Have you installed Auxo LE on your iOS 9 device? If so, what’s your experience been like thus far?
