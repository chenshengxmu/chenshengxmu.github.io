* Photos appeared on Instagram Tuesday afternoon, offering what could be the first look at the packaging of the Apple Watch. Instagram user Jeremy Gan uploaded the images, first spotted by MacRumors, to the social network showing off the Watch’s box.
* It’s impossible to confirm the validity of these photos, as they could depict elaborate concepts, unofficial packaging or may just be flat out fake. But the device shown in the images looks like the larger stainless steel Apple Watch with Milanese Loop, and box details seem to be in line with Apple’s style.

* Since publishing the photos, Jeremy Gan has now set his Instagram account to private.
* The Apple Watch will go up for pre-order on Friday, but it won’t start shipping to customers until it becomes officially available on April 24. The highly anticipated wearable has a starting price of $349, for the entry-level aluminum sport model, with top-end 18K models costing as much as $17,000.
