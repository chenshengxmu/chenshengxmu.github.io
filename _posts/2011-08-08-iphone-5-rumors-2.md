* It seems like the rumors and speculation for Apple’s upcoming smartphone have been non-stop over the last couple of months. To make things even more confusing, a lot of the information is completely contradictory.
* Is it going to be a modest upgrade or will Apple give it a major overhaul? Will it launch in September or October? How are we supposed to keep up with all of it? Luckily, the folks over at The Next Web were kind enough to help put everything in perspective with this infographic…
* The hard work was done by the Infographic Labs team. Their image not only lists several of the iPhone 5 rumors we’ve heard over the last few months, but it also predicts the likelihood of the gossip materializing this Fall.

* I think you’ll agree with most of the predictions on here, save for the 60% chance it gives iCloud integration. We’ve already seen several instances of iCloud embedded into iOS 5, which will likely ship with the new hardware.
* Which predictions do you agree/disagree with?
