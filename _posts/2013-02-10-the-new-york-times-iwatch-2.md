* Hot on the heels of the popular ‘iWatch’ speculation piece from former Apple employee Bruce Tognazzini, comes a report from The New York Times that claims that such a product is actually in the works.
* Citing sources ‘familiar with the matter,’ The Times is reporting (for the second time in the last three years) that Apple is currently in the process of developing a smartwatch that utilizes curved glass…
* From The NYT’s Nick Bilton:
* “In its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple is experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass, according to people familiar with the company’s explorations, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they are not allowed to publicly discuss unreleased products. Such a watch would operate Apple’s iOS platform, two people said, and stand apart from competitors based on the company’s understanding of how such glass can curve around the human body.”
* Again, this isn’t the first time that the outlet has claimed that Apple is working on a wrist-bound iOS device. Back in December 2011, Bilton reported that the company was looking at making curved-glass iPods.
* Additionally, a rumor surfaced this past December, alleging that Apple was working with Intel on a Bluetooth smartwatch with a 1.5-inch display that would debut sometime in 2013. Yes, it was crazy, but still relevant.
* The point is, industry watchers obviously believe the smartwatch space is ripe for the taking. And Bilton argues that Apple has both the technology—with patents on curved glass displays, etc.—and the interest to do it.
* “Mr. Cook is clearly interested in wearables. In the past he has been seen sporting a Nike FuelBand, which tracks a user’s daily exertion. The FuelBand data is shared wirelessly with an iPhone app.
* Bob Mansfield, Apple’s senior vice president for technologies, who previously ran hardware engineering, has also been particularly interested in wearables, an Apple employee said. Mr. Mansfield is engrossed by devices that connect to the iPhone, through Bluetooth, sharing information back-and-forth from the human body to the phone, including the Nike FuelBand and Jawbone Up.”
* Obviously, none of this guarantees that we’ll see an actual iWatch hit the market anytime soon. Just look at the long-rumored Apple TV set. That being said, with three years between the first iPhone and first iPad, and the iPad now reaching 3 years old, I don’t think we’ll have to wait long to see Apple unveil an all-new product. The question is, what will it be?
* What do you think?
