* Apple just unveiled an interesting little enhancement to the stock Phone app that in iOS 6 includes a number of new features, such as canned responses, a brand new Do Not Disturb setting, FaceTime video calls over cellular networks and the unification of your phone number and Apple ID (say goodbye to the dreaded iMessage conundrum), to name a few…
* Apple’s iOS boss Scott Forstall said during the WWDC keynote:
* You probably have been in a meeting where you can’t take a call, but you want to text back, or remind yourself to call them later. Now there’s a new tool in the phone app where you can.
* Now when a phone call comes in, you can choose to reply with a message, use one of the canned responses or choose to be reminded later.
* iOS 6 adds new calling features to your iPhone. Now when you decline an incoming call, you can instantly reply with a text message or set a callback reminder. And when things are just too hectic, turn on Do Not Disturb and you won’t be bothered by anyone — except can’t-miss contacts like your boss or your better half.
* Reply:
* When a call comes in that you can’t answer right away, swipe up to reveal options. Quickly reply with an iMessage or SMS. Use a preset message or write a custom one.
* Remind:
* When a call comes in that you can’t answer right away, swipe up to reveal options. Set up a time- or location-based callback reminder. Get an alert in an hour or when you leave your current location, arrive at home, or get to work.
* Do Not Disturb:
* Turn on Do Not Disturb to suppress all incoming calls and notifications. Enable it manually or schedule a recurring time, like after 10:00 p.m. on weeknights. Or allow calls from your favorites or specific contact groups.

* The Do Not Disturb feature goes even further than that so you can choose to be reminded in an hour or get a reminder when you leave. This, of course, sets up a geofence around your current location so your device will remind you when you leave.
* Apple has also unified your phone number and Apple ID so if someone calls you on your phone number for Facetime, you can answer it on your iPad or Mac. Plus, they’re doing the same thing with iMessage.

* As for making phone calls, finder controls are available letting you choose which phone calls you can receive. You can also do groups and set up repeated calls: that is, if someone calls a second time in three minutes, their call is probably very important so it’ll come through.
