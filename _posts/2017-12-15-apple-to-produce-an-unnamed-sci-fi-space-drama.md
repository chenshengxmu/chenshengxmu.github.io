* Apple has picked up an unnamed sci-fi space drama from a Star Trek veteran.
* The untitled series explores what would’ve happened if the global space race had never ended.
* According to Deadline, the project will be led by Ronald D. Moore, who is the showrunner for “Outlander” on Starz and previously worked on “Star Trek” and the “Battlestar Galactica” reboot.
* The project hails from Sony Pictures Television and Moore’s studio-based Tall Ship Productions. It was created and written by Moore, along with Fargo co-executive producers Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi. All three will also executive produce along with Maril Davis of Moore’s Tall Ship Productions.
* This is is the third original scripted series ordered by the Cupertino firm.
* It has also ordered a reboot of “Amazing Stories” from Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Television and executive producer Bryan Fuller, as well as a morning show drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.
* Apple has been doubling down on its original content strategy this year by building a worldwide video team led by Sony Television hires Jamie Ehrlicht and Zack Van Amburg.
