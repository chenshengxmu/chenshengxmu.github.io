* After being announced at CES 2018, Netgear has followed through with adding HomeKit support to their Arlo Baby HD camera.
* Lucky for existing owners, the new functionality arrives via an update through the app, similar to what we saw with the Logitech Circle 2.
* Version 2.4.6 of the Arlo app, brings one notable feature – “Apple Homekit support for Arlo Baby”.
* After the update, Arlo will allow you to add the HD baby cam to Apple’s Home app. You can then view the feed there, on your Apple Watch/TV, or with other HomeKit apps like Homecam.
* While the cameras will still continue to work through the Arlo app, the Home app allows to watch live, use two-way talk, view a snapshot of the last motion, and more.
* Unlike other HomeKit cameras, Arlo Baby does not expose the motion sensor to HomeKit.
* The Arlo Baby actually captures the temperature and humidity of the room, detects motion, and has a multi-colored night-light. All of these could have been added to HomeKit alongside the live feed, but Netgear has left those out.
* It is completely plausible that these could be added in the future, but it seems a missed opportunity at the moment.
* I am also excited to see Netgear jumping on the HomeKit bandwagon, as we hopefully could see support come to the other increasingly popular Arlo cameras.
* The Arlo Baby is available on Amazon for $199. The price is higher than other cameras, but the bevy of other features helps make up for that price. Also, they are pretty cute.
