* The long-rumored BlackBerry Messenger is finally launching on iOS and Android before the end of summer (so before September 22). It looks like the software is coming along nicely as Canada’s embattled smartphone maker has started rolling out invites to a small number of users on its Beta Zone website, asking them to test out the Android and iOS versions of the software…
* As reported by BlackBerryOS.com, the program is not yet available for everyone.
* Some users with a BlackBerry ID reported receiving an email invitation seen top of post. The first BBM beta is available under the Eligible Programs section.
* The beta app requires an iOS 6 or Android Ice Cream Sandwich device. BBM for iOS and Android is slated for worldwide release later this summer, the email notice reads.
* MobileSyrup previously said the free cross-platform app will initially include basic messaging and group chatting features. Advanced capabilities such as voice, screen sharing and the BBM Channels will be added via future updates.
* I fear it may be too late for BBM now. The IM landscape is a pretty crowded space divided between Apple’s iMessage, Google’s new Hangouts app, Whats App and Viber.
* Will you be giving BBM on your iPhone a try once it goes public?
