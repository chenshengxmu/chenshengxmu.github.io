* For those of you that love Google Maps more than iOS’ built-in Maps app, Google Maps has a wonderful feature built into it that lets you download maps from specific regions for offline use.
* This feature is perfect for when you need a map and you know you won’t have any cellular coverage or you don’t want to waste your precious capped data on navigation tasks.
* Right before a big road trip, you can follow this tutorial we’re about to walk you through so you can download any region on Google Maps for your offline viewing pleasure. So let’s get started!
* With Google Maps, you can download regions or areas for use even when you’re offline. For those who are unaware, offline refers to when your internet connection is absent or too slow to be used.
* This feature comes in handy in a pinch whenever you suddenly find yourself plagued with lack of coverage, or you don’t want to eat through your limited data plan on a day you feel like going for a road trip.
* Google notes that you can download up to 120,000 square kilometers of map space at a time and that downloads can sometimes be in excess of 1,725 megabytes. The region that you wish to download is adjustable, so of course, you don’t have to download the full 120,000 square kilometers if you don’t wish to.
* Also keep in mind that offline maps have expiration dates, so you may have to re-download them if you downloaded offline maps too long ago and try to access them again in the future.
* Without further ado, let’s get to showing you how you can download regions of Google Maps for offline navigation. Here are the steps:
* 1) Launch the Google Maps app on your iOS device and search for a location you want to save for offline navigation. We’ll use New York, NY for our example.

* 2) After loading the area, tap on the white banner at the bottom of the Google Maps app to reveal more information about the location.
* 3) Tap on the Download button to download the selected region for offline use.
* 4) In the next interface, tap on the Download button again.
* 5) Now you’ll be asked to name the offline area. Give it a name, and then tap on the Save button.

* 6) Your download will begin, and you’ll be returned to the Google Maps interface when the download completes.
* Congratulations, you’ve just downloaded an offline region that can be used for navigation even when you don’t have internet access!
* After you’ve saved a few maps for offline use, you’d better believe there’s a way to manage them. We’ll show you how below:
* 1) Launch the Google Maps app on your iOS device, and then tap on the three lines on the left side of the app’s search bar.

* 2) Tap on the Offline areas button that appears in the Google Maps sidebar.
* 3) This will open your Offline areas manager. Tap on the location that you wish to manage. In our case, it’s New York, NY.
* 4) Now you’ll see the expiration date for the offline map download, and you can even manually delete the offline map, or you can renew it.
