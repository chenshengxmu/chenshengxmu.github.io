* One of the things Apple included on devices with the 3D Touch display is the ability to use a firm press gesture on an app icon to reveal a bevy of app shortcuts right from the Home screen. While this is useful, the menus have always looked pretty bland.
* A jailbreak tweak called 3DColorChanger10 by gilsharhar7 fixes this problem by offering a myriad of comprehensive customization options that dwarf any tweak in its department.
* When you install 3DColorChanger10, you’ll find a new preferences pane in the Settings app that arms you with an arsenal of colorization options:

* All of the options at your fingertips include the following:
* For those who don’t like to spend a lot of time configuring settings, the auto detect color method might be the best choice, because this lets the tweak decide the color for you. Those who like going all out with a custom look and feel, on the other hand, are going to feel right at home with all of the custom options, which will apply to every one of your menus, no matter the app.
* It’s worth noting that all of the settings are applied on the fly without the need to respring, which means you save time and can easily check your results.
* It’s also worth noting that if you don’t have to have a 3D Touch device, you can still use this tweak by installing a gesture simulator tweak like Peek-a-Boo. This will let you tap and hold on your app icons to bring up these menus, rather than using a firm press, and you’ll still get the colorization effects from 3DColorChanger10.

* If you’re interested in trying 3DColorChanger10, you can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is intended to work on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
