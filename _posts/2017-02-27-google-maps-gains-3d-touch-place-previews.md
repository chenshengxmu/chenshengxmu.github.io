* Last week, I whined about Google dragging its feet when it comes to implementing support for important iOS features, like 3D Touch, in apps such as Gmail. Other iPhone and iPad apps from Google have been more aggressive in adopting 3D Touch features, including Maps. In the latest update, Google Maps was bumped to version 4.28 and now allows users who have an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus to press places on the map to get quicker access to popular actions.
* Previewing a place within Google Maps with 3D Touch pulls up an overlay with shortcuts to actions like getting directions, calling a place, opening its homepage in a browser and a Share Location action that brings up iOS’s multi-purpose share sheet.
