* Late last year, we reported that Apple was preparing to give iTunes its first major overhaul in 10 years. The update would come in the form of iTunes 11, and feature a revamped UI and deeper iCloud integration.
* Since then, the report has been independently confirmed by both TechCrunch and 9to5Mac, who are also hearing that such a change is on the way. And tonight, a major news outlet adds its weight to the story…
* Bloomberg reports:
* “Apple Inc. (AAPL) plans an overhaul of iTunes that would mark one of the largest changes to the world’s biggest music store since its 2003 debut, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
* Apple will unveil the changes by year’s end, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. The company will more closely integrate its iCloud file-store service with iTunes so users can more seamlessly access and manage their music, videos and downloaded software apps across different Apple gadgets, the people said. Apple also plans new features for sharing music, the people said.”
* The sharing aspect of the report is particular interesting, because word is that Apple is looking to get rid of its Ping service, as it makes way for more popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter — both of which are now deeply integrated into iOS. We have to admit, it’d be nice to be able to quickly share what song you’re listening to from iTunes, the Music app in iOS, etc.
* Other than that, Bloomberg doesn’t offer much in the way of new information. Further iCloud integration seems like a given at this point, and we still don’t know much about what UI changes we’ll see in iTunes 11. But our fingers are crossed for a complete redesign.
* Nevertheless, it certainly looks like a new iTunes is coming. And it sounds like we could see it as early as October — right around the time Apple is expected to unveil its next-generation iPhone. Yep, fall is looking more interesting by the day.
* What are you hoping to see in iTunes 11?
