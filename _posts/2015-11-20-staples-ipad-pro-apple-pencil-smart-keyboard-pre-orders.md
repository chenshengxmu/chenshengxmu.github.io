* If you missed out on Best Buy’s earlier sale of the Apple Pencil, then I have some good news for you. Staples is now accepting pre-orders for both the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro.
* If you act now, you can expect both items to ship on November 25th, which is next Wednesday. If you choose 1-day shipping, chances are you could receive both items by next Friday. That’s a whole lot better than Apple’s end-of-December estimates, but you better act fast…
* Both products, which are currently very difficult to come by, are generally sold out at Apple physical retail locations, and online. If you’d prefer to try to snag one from your local Apple Store, you should use Apple’s online chat feature to try to verify local inventory before hand.
* Here’s hoping that supplies become more widely available soon. Until then, we’ll do our best to keep our ear to the street and keep you in the know.
