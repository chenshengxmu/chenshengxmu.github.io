* The Dev Team has pushed a new update for their flagship jailbreak tool, RedSn0w. RedSn0w 0.9.9 beta 6 brings several bug fixes, both functional and cosmetic.
* RedSn0w 0.9.9 beta 6 is a jailbreak for iOS 5, which now brings Windows compatibility to the mix. It also fixes the network crash that iPhone 3GS owners with 06.15.00 basebands might have encountered when using Location Services…
* From the Dev Team blog:
* “For iPhone3GS owners with the 06.15 baseband, this redsn0w eliminates the network crash you saw when using Location Services in iOS5 (in fact, you don’t even need to disable Location Services anymore during the initial setup). The cosmetic fix is to the visual countdown you see when going into DFU mode.
* It’s okay to re-run this redsn0w over an existing device jailbroken at iOS5. Just choose “Jailbreak” again and de-select Cydia (in other words, all the checkboxes will be unchecked). If you are lucky enough to have an old-bootrom iPhone3GS, please pre-select the IPSW first (redsn0w can’t yet auto-detect the FW version of your old-bootrom 3GS if it’s already been jailbroken).”
* For those asking, yes, RedSn0w 0.9.9 beta 6 is still a tethered jailbreak, except for iPhone 3GS old bootrom devices.
* You can download RedSn0w from our download section, and see our RedSn0w jailbreak page for more details and tutorials on how to use this jailbreak tool.
