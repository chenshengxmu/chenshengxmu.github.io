* Front man for the Chronic Dev Team, Joshua Hill (also known as p0sixninja), has announced a landmark number of crash reports that have already been submitted to his team. The Chronic Dev Team recently released an app that collects iOS crash reports in iTunes and sends them to the team’s private servers to help find exploits for the future iOS 5 untethered jailbreak.
* After only one week, the team of hackers has collected over 10 million crash reports from jailbreak supporters worldwide. Joshua and the rest of the Chronic Dev Team are working to parse the crash report data to help create a stable untethered jailbreak for Apple’s iOS 5.
* In a recent tweet, Joshua Hill announced that 10,071,868 crash reports have been uploaded to the Chronic Dev Team’s servers since the tool for collecting the data was released last Sunday. We’ve told you how to use the Chronic Dev Crash Reporter app to help the team find exploits for future jailbreaks.
* The Chronic Dev Team is using Google’s MapReduce software to compute the massive amount of report data that is being sent in by jailbreakers around the world. According to Joshua, MapReduce allows his team to “run tests that would take days normally in only seconds.”
* There’s still no ETA on an official untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 and the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, but this incredible number of submitted crash reports is a testament to how committed the jailbreak community is to making the Chronic Dev Team’s jailbreak a reality. The team’s hackers have already found important iOS 5 exploits, but Joshua has said that they remain “highly guarded until the right time.”
