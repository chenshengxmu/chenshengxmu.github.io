* As you may have heard, Apple is beginning to get petty with their fight against the jailbreak community.
* The latest strategy taken on by Apple is to prevent you from reading the books you purchased on iBooks if it detects a jailbroken iPhone.
* @Comex responded first with his hilariously named “Hunnypot” solution, and now the Chronic Dev team has followed suit with the release of GreenPois0n RC 6.1…

* Hot off the heels of the release GreenPois0n RC 6 comes a small incremental update that puts the iBooks issues to bed.
* As you’re no doubt already aware of, GreenPois0n is a tool for iPhone users that allows you to perform an untethered jailbreak on iOS 4.2.1.
* Now we can reboot our iPhone’s away from home, and read the books we paid our hard earned money for. Good deal.
* You can download GreenPois0n RC 6.1 here for both Windows and Mac.
* Are you surprised that the jailbreak community has responded with a fix so quickly?
