* Best Buy has a tempting offer this holiday season, selling Apple’s entry-level iPhone 6s with sixteen gigabytes of storage for just one buck, normally $199 on-contract.
* The catch? You have to sign up for a new two-year contract with Verizon or Sprint. Despite the requirement to commit your soul to Verizon or Sprint for the next 24 months, you’re still getting a fair deal on Apple’s latest handset, which starts from $649 off-contract on the Apple Online Store.
* Unfortunately, the electronics retailer does not offer this deal for the 64GB and 128GB editions of the iPhone 6s, nor is it available for the iPhone 6s Plus models.
* As a bonus, if you own a used iPhone 5 in working condition and want to trade it in, Best But will treat you to a $200 gift card. The iPhone 6s is also on sale at Verizon and Sprint, now available for $99 for Verizon and $199 for Sprint.
* In addition, Best Buy has discounted the Apple Watch to just $249 and is offering a cool deals on iPads: the iPad Air 2 is $125 off and all iPad mini 4 models are $100 off.
