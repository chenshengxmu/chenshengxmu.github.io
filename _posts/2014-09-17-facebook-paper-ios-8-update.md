* The social networking behemoth Facebook has just updated its popular Paper app for the iPhone with iOS 8 compatibility following the release of Apple’s mobile operating system this morning.
* Facebook Paper version 1.2.2, a maintenance update, also enables high-definition video uploading. Previously, you could only upload photos in high-definition so this is going to be a nice upgrade for users who tend to post lots of video clips to the social network on the go.
* Check out the full list of new features and improvements below.
* Paper 1.2.2 changelog:
* The 53.3-megabyte download runs natively on the iPhone and iPod touch and requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
