* Folks looking to test out the just-launched Apple Pay service, but don’t have the option to try it in-store, can download the latest version of the Apple Store app. Apple just posted an update for the digital storefront that adds support for the new one-touch mobile payment service.
* Folks who have a compatible Apple Pay device, who have updated to iOS 8.1, can set it up either through the Passbook app or in Settings. Once you have a card on file, apps updated with support for the service will offer Apple Pay as a payment option during the checkout process.
* It looks like for now, only the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus support Apple Pay both in-store and in-app. The Apple Watch will support the service when it launches, and the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 will also have limited support, but for now it seems that older devices have been left out.
* Announced in September, Apple Pay will allow users with compatible devices to pay for goods and services both online and in-store by simply tapping their Touch ID Home button. Expect several other apps to be updated with support, but for now, you can grab Apple Store for free.
