* We’ve been telling you about a variety of accessories for the iPhone 6 throughout the year. Our goal is to let you know the different options available so you can make a well-informed decision when choosing what to buy.
* Below is an accessory round up for what we believe are some of the best ultrathin cases for the iPhone 6. You may recall our previous minimalist case list and wonder what the difference is. It’s subtle, and sometimes they overlap, but minimalist cases focus on design, while ultra thin cases are all about being nearly invisible. If you don’t see your favorite ultra thin case on our list, feel free to add it in the comments section.

* This ultrathin, ultra clear case is practically invisible. It is form fitted and made from polycarbonate with a urethane coating designed to dissuade yellowing that often occurs with transparent cases. It is rigid, but has a soft coating, which helps with the grip factor. There are cutaways and holes for ports and the back-facing camera. The buttons are covered for dust protection. It does not have a protruding lip to protect the screen from scratches, and it does not protect the back-facing camera lens, but most ultrathin cases don’t. It is available on Amazon for $13. There is a version for the iPhone 6 Plus in multiple colors for between $15 and $18.

* Sebastien’s favorite, the Scarf is the perfect combination of ultrathin design with a choice of material that makes it more secure to hold and grip in your hand. At 0.35 mm thin and 5.5 grams, you likely won’t be able to tell the case is on your phone to begin with. Like all other ultrathin cases, it does offer minimal protection from drops, but will definitely protect your device from day to day scratches. The Scarf is available on Amazon for $15 for the iPhone 6, and $16 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

* Weighing in at only 0.3 ounces, this case measures in at 0.4mm thick, which isn’t the thinnest you can buy, but it comes close. It is made from flexible thermoplastic polyurethane and wraps around your iPhone 6 like a skin. It has cutaways for ports, buttons, and the back-facing camera. It does not have a protruding lip to protect the screen from scratches, and it does not protect the back-facing camera lens. It is available on Amazon for between $8 and $9, depending on your color preference. There is a version for the iPhone 6 Plus for $7.

* Even thinner than its predecessors, the Veil measures just 0.35mm thick. It is made from rigid polypropylene, which has a level of flexibility that makes it possible to be so thin while still being able to snap around the iPhone 6. It has cutaways for ports and buttons. It does not have a protruding lip to protect the screen from scratches. However, one special feature on this case is that it does have a .7mm ridge near the back-facing camera to protect it. It is available on Amazon for $15. There is also a version for the iPhone 6 Plus for $16.

* This case is not nearly as thin as the other ultrathin cases, but it stands out because it offers a minimal amount of drop protection. You may want to keep the bulk away, but know you have slippery fingers. It won’t do a lot, but due to its double layer protection of high-density carbonate and ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, it gives more protection than others in its class. It does not have a protruding lip to protect the screen from scratches. However, it is thick enough to extend past the back-facing camera lens for some protection. It is available on Amazon for $10. There is also a version for the iPhone 6 Plus for $14.

* As for the thinnest case you can get on the market so far, this 0.3mm one fits the criteria. It is so thin you can barely even see it when it is covering your iPhone 6. Plus, it only weighs 0.3 ounces, so you can barely even feel it, either. There are cutaways for the ports and camera, and the buttons are covered for dust protection. It does not have a protruding lip to protect the screen from scratches, and it does not protect the back-facing camera lens. It is available on Amazon for $7, which is the least expensive of this lot, too.
