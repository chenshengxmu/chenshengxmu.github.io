* With less than 24 hours until the annual App Store holiday freeze, developers are pushing out last-minute app updates like crazy.
* But more importantly, ’tis the season when not-to-be-missed promotions and discounts become available as an early Christmas present.
* Cody yesterday covered a bunch of notable iOS games discounts from the likes of Disney, Warner Bros and others and today a brand new holiday deal on iPhone and iPad apps goes live to help your wallet.
* App Santa, a collaborative effort by high-profile developers, is offering deep discounts on fifteen popular iPhone and iPad applications, including 1Password, Tweetbot 3, Launch Center Pro, Screens, Clear+ and more. You can grab these fine apps with as much as 60 percent discount. Your download links are right after the break…
* From App Santa:
* Naughty or nice, App Santa brings you the best deals on apps from some of the most popular developers on the App Store!
* I’ve been very naughty this year!
* Anyways, here are your discounted apps, in no particular order:
* Any of these is admittedly an excellent piece of software in its own right.
* Folks who’ve been on the fence of buying one of these apps should take action.
* If I had to pick my favorite, it’d be 1Password.
* By the way, AgileBits is celebrating that 1Password made it on MacWorld’s and Apple’s Mac App Store Best of 2013 list so they’re discounting the Mac edition by 30 percent.
* You can pick up 1Password for Mac from the Mac App Store for $34.99 for a limited time, normally a $49.99 value.
* And, there really is no reason not to pick up the new Tweetbot now.
* This promotion will only last for the holidays.
* Do you see any personal favorites of yours on App Santa’s list?
