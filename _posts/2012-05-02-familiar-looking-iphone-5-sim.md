* For the second time in the last two weeks, a parts vendor has leaked a purported ‘iPhone 5’ component. Last Tuesday we saw some Home buttons surface that reportedly belonged to Apple’s next-generation handset, and now we’ve come across a SIM card tray.
* As noted by MacRumors, SW-BOX.com has posted some information on a claimed ‘iPhone 5’ SIM card tray that it’s apparently just obtained from one of its parts suppliers. And, as the site points out, it looks nearly identical to its iPhone 4/4S counterpart…
* “The tray appears essentially identical to the SIM card tray found in the iPhone 4S and 4, and if the part is indeed legitimate it suggests that Apple may retain a similar flat-edged form factor for the forthcoming device. Such a design would be opposed to a tapered or rounded-edge design that would likely require a somewhat curved exterior surface for the tray or at least a thinner tray profile as was seen in earlier iPhone models…”
* This is somewhat bad news for folks, including us, who are hoping that Apple will unveil a completely revamped iPhone this fall. The new handset is a matter of months away, and we’ve yet to see any evidence that suggests it’ll look much different than last year’s model.
* Obviously, there’s nothing to say that this SIM tray doesn’t just belong to an iPhone 4/4S. But still, we can’t help but feel a little bit of deja vu.
