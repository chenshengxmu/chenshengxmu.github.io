* The default Cydia repos hold the majority of the awesome jailbreak apps and tweaks that we all know and love, but from time to time, you’ll need to use a third-party source for certain Cydia packages. Some third-party repos, like Ryan Petrich’s beta repo, are one of the first things I add after jailbreaking my iPhone. Other repos aren’t nearly as necessary, but still nice to have available.
* In this post, I’ll share with you 10 different third-party Cydia sources that you can add to Cydia to gain access to additional apps, tweaks, and themes. I’ll also showcase one tweak from each repo that makes it worth consideration.
* Note that this is a highly curated list, and I’m purposely omitting repos that house pirated tweaks and apps. I also avoid things like myrepospace, as it doesn’t have the best reputation. So while 10 repos isn’t as much as 50 repos, chances are, you’ll find at least one quality release on each repo that I recommend that you’ll derive benefits from.
* Keep in mind that most of the listed repos contain other compelling packages, and most are updated from time to time to upgrade existing packages and add new downloads.
* If you’re going to add this many third-party repos, I definitely recommend using CSources2 in order to manage them. This jailbreak tool makes managing repos infinitely easier than going about it solo.
* What’s your favorite repo on this list? Are there any repos that you think should definitely be listed here that I omitted? Drop me a line in the comment section and let me know.
