* Contradicting a recent report, Japanese outlet Nikkei Asian Review wrote Wednesday that Apple’s rumored 5.8-inch iPhone will have a display based on active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) technology that’s slightly curved on the sides, but not as curved as Samsung’s Galaxy series.
* A source familiar with the handset’s design said the curve of the iPhone 8 screen will be “gentler” than the screen curvature of Samsung’s Edge handsets because of the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens.
* The sleek AMOLED display will be supplied by Samsung Display and is said to offer clearer pictures and allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches, with the previously rumored function area with tappable shortcuts positioned at the bottom where the Home button and the Touch ID sensor are located on current iPhones.
* China’s Biel Crystal and Lens Technology will supply the glass backs for 2017 iPhones.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted iPhone 8 would adopt an all-glass design to support wireless charging. Together with key iPhone assembler Foxconn, Biel Crystal and Lens Technology will also provide the front glass covers.
* Here are other advantages of OLED and AMOLED screens over LCD ones:
* The report argues that because AMOLED screens have been adopted by most Android smartphones Apple may be unable to offer any game-changing functions with iPhone 8’s curved screens.
* “Some reports suggest in recent days that Apple will only give the premium handset a flat display, but the source said that would not be using OLED optimally,” reads the report. For what it’s worth, Nikkei’s source stated that iPhone 8’s design has not been finalized and could still change.
* iPhone 8 may not release in September alongside the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates due to manufacturing issues related to mass production of the handset’s enhanced 3D Touch module.

* Last week, IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam and Display expert Raymond Soneira of DisplayMate predicted that iPhone 8 might end up using a flat rather than curved screen, using the existing 2.5D glass design much like the iPhone 6/6s/7 series.
* According to Soneira, flat AMOLED screens based on a glass substrate “cost considerably less” and are available in “much higher production volumes” than curved screens based on flexible plastic substrates.
