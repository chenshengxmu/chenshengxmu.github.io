* Secure instant messaging service Telegram today launched voice calls in its desktop app for Mac, Windows and Linux nearly two months after implementing the voice-calling feature in Telegram Messenger for iPhone and iPad.
* To make sure Telegram calls are the best in terms of quality, speed and security, the app uses artificial intelligence to update its neural network after each call about things such as network speed, ping times, packet loss percentage and other factors that influence the quality of your VoIP calls.
* Based on gathered data, the app optimizes dozens of parameters to improve the quality of future calls on the given device and network. By default, Telegram calls are lightweight.
* Telegram Calls are now available on DESKTOPS. E2E encrypted, crystal clear, constantly improved by machine learning https://t.co/9coPjh9Ac3 pic.twitter.com/AXinba2B9b

* If there’s a change in your connection during the call, the app will make necessary adjustments.
* For instance, Telegram may boost your sound quality on stable Wi-Fi connection or use less data if your Wi-Fi or cellular coverage is spotty at best.
* Whenever possible, your calls will go over a peer-to-peer connection using the best audio codecs to save traffic while providing “crystal-clear quality.” When a peer-to-peer connection cannot be established, the app will use the closest server to you.
* Telegram has its own distributed infrastructure all over the world to ensure the fastest possible delivery of your texts and seamless voice calling experience. As mentioned, VoIP calls on Telegram use end-to-end encryption, just like the app’s Secret Chats feature, to prevent eavesdropping.
* For voice calls, however, they’ve improved the key exchange mechanism. “To make sure your call is 100 percent secure, you and your recipient just need to compare four emoji”, said the team.
* Bottom line: the quality of Telegram calls will further improve as you and others use them, thanks to the built-in machine learning. And with group calling, video calling and screen sharing apparently on the team’s to-do list, Telegram is bound to become a capable Skype alternative.
* As soon as VoIP calls are enabled for your country, a phone icon will appear on every profile page in Telegram Desktop.
* Telegram for iOS is available free via App Store.
* Telegram Desktop can be downloaded from Mac App Store or through the official website.
