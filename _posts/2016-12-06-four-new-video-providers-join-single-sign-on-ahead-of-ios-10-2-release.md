* Single Sign-On, a feature that allows supported video apps to use your saved cable credentials, is launching some time next week alongside iOS 10.2 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and tvOS 10.1 for the fourth-generation Apple TV. Ahead of these software updates, an additional four providers have pledged to support Single Sign-On at launch.
* The following Single Sign-On providers have been added:
* AT&T’s DirecTV service was added as a Single-Sign On option in iOS 10.2 beta 3 last month. Interestingly, Apple appears to have removed GVTC Communications which was previously listed as a Single Sign-on option.
* Customers will only need to save their cable credentials once and the system will automatically use that information to authorize them in compatible video apps.

* Single Sign-On apps can be managed on iOS 10.2 devices in Settings → TV Provider. On tvOS 10.1, the feature can be found in Settings → Accounts → TV Provider.
* Barring any unforeseen removals or additions, Single Sign-On should include support for eight cable providers at launch—DirecTV, Dish, Hotwire, Sling TV, CenturyLink Prism, Hawaiian Telecom, MetroCast and GTA—with more to follow at a later stage.
* The App Store’s dedicated page will highlight Single Sign-On-compatible apps when the feature releases for public consumption.
* Thanks, Carlos!
