* Facebook yesterday unveiled another Snapchat-like feature in the mobile Messenger app for iPhone and iPad.
* As messaging is now more visual than ever and Messenger has gained the ability to send high-resolution photos, Facebook is introducing a visual messaging feature called World Effects.
* Not unlike Snapchat, this lets you drop 3D objects into your surroundings to capture and share fun moments with your family and friends. One of the effects has you adding a three-dimensional heart that floats over someone’s head. Another one allows you to add a virtual arrow to point to an exact object or location in a panorama. Yet another one involves a celebratory robot which plays three different kinds of music.
* Watch a quick video demonstration of World Effects below.
* Aside from the heart, arrow and robot, other new camera effects include a unicorn and word bubbles like “love,” “bae,” “heart” and “miss you.” To add a World Effect to your Messenger conversation, tap the camera icon inside your chat and then scroll to pick an effect to add to your image. Additional filters will be added to Messenger over time.
* World Effects are rolling out now to everyone.
* Let us know what you think of Messenger’s World Effects down below in the comments!
* Facebook Messenger is available for free on App Store.
