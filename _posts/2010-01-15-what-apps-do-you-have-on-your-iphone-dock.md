* Tell me what you have on your dock and I’ll tell you who you are…
* The apps you have on your dock can tell a lot about your iPhone usage. As you can see, my dock is pretty standard. I have the mail app, Tweetie 2, Byline and Safari. These are the apps I use the most.
* You’ll notice that my phone.app is not even there. That’s because I rarely make calls. I’ve come to realize that what I like the most about my iPhone, it’s the ” i “, not so much the “phone“.
* What apps do you have in your dock? Why did you choose these?
