* Apple during June’s WWDC updated its MacBook Air lineup with the latest-generation Intel chips and related hardware bumps, leaving the rest of the Mac lineup intact. Today, the company has refreshed its iMac all-in-one lineup via a simple press release, clearing the stage for October iPads.
* The upgraded internals include faster fourth-generation Intel Haswell platform sporting power-efficient quad-core CPU. Also new: better graphics, next generation Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options.
* Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* The faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also known as Gigabit Wi-Fi) paves the way for up to three times faster wireless data transfers compared to the previous generation. Apple of course recently updated its AirPort wireless appliances with 802.11ac compatibility.
* Due to the new PCIe-based flash storage (also found in the mid-2013 MacBook Air), Apple says the iMac’s optional Fusion Drive (a HDD + SDD combo) is now up to 50 percent faster than the previous generation.

* You can now configure your iMac with up to 1TB of all-flash storage and choose between a 1TB or 3TB Fusion Drive. All iMac models come standard with 8GB of memory (expandable to 32GB of RAM) and a 1TB hard drive, as well as two Thunderbolt and four USB 3.0 ports on the back.
* A media release quotes marketing chief Phil Schiller as saying:
* iMac continues to be the example that proves how beautiful, fast and fun a desktop computer can be. Inside its ultra-thin aluminum enclosure, the new iMac has the latest Intel processors, faster graphics, next generation 802.11ac Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage.
* There are three basic configurations to choose from.
* The entry-level $1,299 iMac with a 21.5-inch screen, a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.2 GHz and integrated Intel Iris Pro graphics that AnandTech says offers “substantial power savings” in non-gaming apps and decent speed.

* The flagship 27-inch model is available in two configurations: a $1,799 variant with a 3.2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.6 GHz and Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 755M GPU and a $1,999 model with a bit faster 3.4 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.8 GHz and the same Nvidia graphics as its lower-priced counterpart.
* In case you were wondering, the GeForce 700 series graphics features twice the video memory and up to 40 percent faster performance than the previous generation. Build-to-order options include a quad-core Intel Core i7 processors clocked at up to 3.5GHz and Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 780M series graphics with up to 4GB of video memory.

* The new iMacs should be available via the online Apple Store starting today, as well as through Apple’s retail stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
* More information on the new iMacs is available on Apple’s website.
* Next month, Apple is slated to release OS X Mavericks. Also, the rumor-mill thinks new iPads are up for an announcement on October 15 and we heard whispers of an impending new Apple TV hardware.
* More on Apple’s agenda: November availability of the new Mac Pro and likely updates to the rest of the Mac lineup, including a Haswell-upgrade for the Mac mini and Retina MacBook Pros.
