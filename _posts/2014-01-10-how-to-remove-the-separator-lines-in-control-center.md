* As you might imagine, CC Deseparator is an extremely simple tweak. In fact, the tweak features no settings, options, or other means of configuration; it’s an install and go affair. We’ve shot a video showcasing how CC Deseparator works in action. Take a look inside for the full scoop…
* If you’re still at a loss as to what CC Deseparator actually accomplishes, then the comparison screenshot below should make it clear for you.
