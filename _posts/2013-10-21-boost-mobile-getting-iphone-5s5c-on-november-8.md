* EV Leaks, the credible source of carrier and device rumors, recently claimed that prepaid U.S. telco Boost Mobile would soon start offering the new iPhones with its Shrinking Payments plan. Sure enough, the Sprint-owned prepaid carrier on Monday announced that it will start carrying both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c on Friday, November 8. The full reveal is right after the break…
* According to Boost:
* Boost Mobile, a leader in the no-contract wireless industry with its exclusive Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinking Payments, today announced it will offer iPhone 5s, the most forward-thinking smartphone in the world, and iPhone 5c, the most colorful iPhone yet, to customers beginning on November 8.
* The web pages describing the devices and plans are now live on the Boost website.
* The Irvine, California-based company offers a $55 a month plan with unlimited talk, text and data (2.5GB capped). Their Shrinking Payments option (see below) lets you reduce your monthly bill by $5 for every six on-time monthly payments, bringing the payments down to $40 per month, all with no annual contracts.

* The other plan Boost offers, the $3 a day Daily Unlimited, provides a day’s worth of unlimited talk, text and data for those who only need those services on the Boost network on an occasional basis.
* Note that because Boost Mobile (which has a 4G network) is a Sprint property, we’re talking about CDMA devices here. Sprint’s other prepaid brand, Virgin Boost, has been offering the new iPhones contract-free for three weeks now.
* Boost can be found at Sprint’s own retail stores and at about 20,000 major retail locations ranging from Best Buy and Target to Walmart and RadioShack. They also sell wireless devices and services on HSN, a leading TV home shopping network.
* Other prepaid U.S. telcos have started selling the new handsets earlier this month.
* Additionally, US Cellular last week said it would add the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c to its lineup on November 8, while Cricket promised to start carrying the devices beginning Friday, October 25.
