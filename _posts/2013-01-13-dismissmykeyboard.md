* DismissMyKeyboard is a recently released jailbreak tweak for jailbroken iPhones that allows you to easily dismiss the software keyboard. While the iPad already benefits from such a feature due to the device’s larger area of real estate, the iPhone’s keyboard has no room for a dedicated dismiss keyboard button like you see on its larger brethren.
* DismissMyKeyboard solves this issue by allowing you to perform a swipe gesture right on the keyboard in order to dismiss it. Take a look at our video walkthrough inside to see how it functions.
* Once the tweak is installed, simply swipe on the space bar towards the Return button to successfully dismiss the keyboard. There are no options or anything else to configure to get it working, just install it and that’s it.
* Available free of charge via Cydia’s BigBoss repo, DismissMyKeyboard is a great way to recover the space taken up by the iPhone’s software keyboard. Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
