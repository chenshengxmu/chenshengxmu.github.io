* Facebook has just rolled out its would-be Snapchat killer, but Snapchat is unfazed. In fact, after introducing a photo sharing feature called My Story earlier in the year, today the startup rolled out a similarly conceived Our Story feature for groups of people.
* In a nutshell, Our Story uses your location to allow fellow Snapchatters who are at the same event location to contribute snaps to the same Story.
* Whereas Our Story is for communal snap at events, My Story is still available when you and only you want to add multiple images to a single album, without other people contributing to it…
* “If you can’t make it to an event, watching Our Story makes you feel like you’re right there,” noted the startup in a blog post Tuesday.
* The feature does not require an app update. The promotional video showcasing Our Story follows below.
* They’re making it available for the first time at Electric Daisy Carnival this weekend.
* If you’re at Electric Daisy Carnival, simply add a Snap to “Our EDC Story” that appears in your “Send to…” page.
* You’ll need to turn on location services to let Snapchat know that you’re actually at the event. We don’t store your location.
* Those who can’t make it to Electric Daisy Carnival can still add EDCLive on Snapchat to check out the event live, through a series of snaps.
* The soundtrack: a song called “Last Train” by Tiësto & Firebeatz, available on iTunes.
* Note that although snaps, chats and stories get deleted from Snapchat’s servers after they expire, recipients can always screenshot your naked images and explicit chats
* Download Snapchat free in the App Store (needs iOS 7.0 or later).
