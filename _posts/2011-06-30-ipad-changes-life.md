* While some folks mock Apple’s use of words like “delightful” and “magical” in their commercials, others are firm believers in the empowering abilities of the products. Take Mrs. Bligh for example.
* Fiona Bligh’s daughter has Albinism. The genetic condition not only affects skin pigment, but also causes eye problems. Holly Bligh has been struggling in school for years with her poor eyesight and inability to fit in. Then one day, Holly’s mom decided to get her daughter an iPad…
* Now, instead of straining to make out words through an unsightly magnifying glass, Holly can pinch and zoom her way through her textbooks.
* “Holly’s enthusiasm to read has grown so much, and it’s definitely increased her independence,” Fiona said after purchasing her daughter the Apple tablet. She estimates that “visual fatigue” now takes twice as long to set in.
* The iPad has also affected Holly’s social life. The new tablet has made the girl quite popular amongst her classmates.
* Fiona was so impressed with her daughter’s quick turnaround, that she emailed Steve Jobs himself to thank him for the device. “I know a lot of people think it’s just a great gadget, but it’s completely changed Holly’s life.”
* Touched by her story, the Apple CEO quickly responded:
* ” Thanks for sharing your experience with me. Do you mind if I read your email to a group of our top 100 leaders at Apple? Thanks, Steve”
* Jobs finished the email with a request for a photo of Holly with her iPad.
* This isn’t the first time I’ve heard an iPad success story like this. The device is being researched as a learning tool for other disabled children, such as kids with autism. Its simple design and large 10″ display combine to make the perfect sidekick for kids with special needs. I’d say that’s magical.
* Thoughts?
