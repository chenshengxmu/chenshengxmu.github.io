* To celebrate the countdown to Christmas TheJailbreakBusters are running 25 continuous days of giveaways, with prizes consisting of tweaks and themes offered up by various developers and designers within the community.
* Currently on Day 7, the iOS advent calendar event has already given away hundreds of freebies, ranging from theme packs such as Splendore by rauseothemes, to the alarm-clock customisation tweak Sleeper by /u/CoBrA2168.
* Today’s prize is the tweak QuickCenter from noted group iOSCreatix, and entering is as easy as pie.
* The simplest way to make an entry is to head over to the jailbreaking subreddit and look for the post each day; today’s post is on the front page. Simply comment on the post with your Cydia ID for a chance to win. If you’re more of a Twitter user however, you can also tweet your Cydia ID, using #25DayJBGiveaway, and remembering to tag @jailbreakbuster. If you’ve already entered on Reddit this will also give you an extra chance to win, but is entirely optional.

* I snagged a copy of the Splendore theme on Day 1, and look forward to seeing what other prizes are revealed as the month goes on. Prizes are announced at 10am EST daily, and winners announced at 10pm. For more details of the countdown, and to see the complete list of previous prizes, visit the JailbreakBusters events website.
