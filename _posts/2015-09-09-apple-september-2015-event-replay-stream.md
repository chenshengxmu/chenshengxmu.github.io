* If you didn’t follow a live-stream of Apple’s keynote presentation this morning, you can now enjoy the event anyway as Apple has just posted the full replay stream of the event on its website. The press conference was packed with several announcements, including the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil, the new Apple TV and more.
* The presentation can be streamed by visiting the Apple Events webpage here.
* The live stream requires Safari 4 or later on OS X 10.6 or later; Safari on iOS 4.2 or later; or QuickTime 7 on Windows. You can also stream this video through your second or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.
* A YouTube version of the keynote video should be made available shortly.
* Apple typically posts its keynotes as downloadable high-definition video podcasts on iTunes within a few hours so we’ll inform you as soon as these go live.
* In addition to the replay stream, Apple’s YouTube channel got refreshed with a selection of accompanying product videos that we embedded into this article.
