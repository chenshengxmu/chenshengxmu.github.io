* Following a series of meetings with tech executives a government leaders this week, President Obama held a press conference this morning to describe his plan to assuage concerns among Americans and foreigners regarding the legality of US surveillance activities.
* During his speech, the President said that the surveillance programs in use by government agencies right now are “operating in a way that prevents abuse.” But the question for his administration, he posed, is how does it make “American people more comfortable?”
* So he outlined the following four initiatives…
* As transcribed by CNET:
* These initiatives—particularly the third one—should appease Apple and a number of other tech companies, who formed an alliance last month in an effort to push for greater government transparency on its surveillance strategies and the information it’s collected.

* In fact, today’s press conference comes after the President reportedly met with Tim Cook and several other high level executives for a closed-door meeting on Thursday to discuss surveillance and related topics. So it’s likely they were able to weigh in on the approach.
* iDB has followed this situation with great interest over the past three months because Apple was named as one of the 9 companies that are allegedly participating in a program that gives the government unrestricted access to private user information without a warrant.
* Apple has denied the claims, and has promised to be more open in the future about the information requests it receives. And Obama’s plan should help them with that.
* What do you think of Obama’s 4 initiatives? Do they make you feel any better about the whole surveillance thing?
