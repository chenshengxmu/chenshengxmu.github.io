* I give credit where credit is due, and I’d have to say Twitter’s official app is a solid way to use Twitter on the iOS platform. Nonetheless, there are still a few ways it could be enhanced, and jailbreak developers are continuously exploring ways to do just that.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak entitled HapticTwitter by iOS developer Squ1dd13, you can introduce a bevy of new haptic feedback triggers to the official Twitter app.
* While I was dubious from the start because I believed that I might get irritated from all the buzzing, the tweak made me realize that it’s possible to integrate haptic feedback into the Twitter app unobtrusively to postulate a delightful user experience.
* It doesn’t go overboard with the buzzing; instead, HapticTwitter only gives you a slight bit of feedback when performing specific actions in the Twitter app, such as:
* HapticTwitter gives you a rapid buzz, almost like what you’d expect from the Haptic Keyboard app that we showed you back in May. That said, the tweak isn’t annoying, and you shouldn’t notice a dramatic drain on battery life.
* Notably, HapticTwitter works best on the iPhone 6s and later because of Apple’s Taptic Engine, but it should also work on older devices with legacy vibrator motors inside of them after a future update hits the Cydia Store.
* For what seems like such a trivial change, I’d have to say that this is one of my all-time favorite mods for the Twitter app, and I’m sure you’ll like it too after trying it.
* If you’re interested in giving HapticTwiter a whirl, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak doesn’t have any options to configure, and it works on all jailbroken devices running iOS 10. Additionally, HapticTwitter requires the official Twitter app for iOS, which you can download for free from the App Store if you’re not already using it.
