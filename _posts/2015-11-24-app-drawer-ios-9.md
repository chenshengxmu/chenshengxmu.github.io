* App Drawer is a new jailbreak tweak that adds an Android-inspired application drawer to jailbroken iPhones. This is a good tool for those of you who want to view all of your installed iOS applications in one place, not scattered amongst multiple Home screen pages or within folders.
* The iPhone-only jailbreak tweak is compatible with iOS 8 and iOS 9, and isn’t yet compatible with jailbroken iPads, though support for the iPad is said to be in the cards. Have a look as we break down the features that App Drawer brings to the table.

* Once installed, you’ll find a new app icon in the Home screen for App Drawer. The app icon is simply labeled “Apps” and serves as a launcher interface for opening any of the apps that you have installed on your device.
* The nice thing about having a central app drawer icon is that it can be moved and relocated anywhere on your device’s Home screen. That means that you can easily move the App Drawer to your dock for easy access to your apps from anywhere.
* Of course, App Drawer allows you to customize the apps that appear in the launcher, and a quick visit to the tweak’s settings in the stock Settings app will reveal that. Users can select hidden applications and favorite applications using simple toggle switches in the preferences.

* I like the idea of App Drawer, but upon using it, there is one glaring flaw that I feel needs to be addressed: the lack of swipe gestures between the Applications and Favorites sections. As it stands now, you have to tap on each header to switch between favorites and standard applications, and that isn’t nearly as intuitive as using a swipe gesture.
* App Drawer’s developer, Guillermo Moran, promises that additional features like iPad support and a customizable Home screen app icon are coming soon. App Drawer is a solid tweak for those of you looking for this type of functionality on iOS 9, but it definitely needs to add a swipe gesture between the two sections within the launcher.
* You can find App Drawer for $1.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you decide to take it for a spin, let us know how you enjoyed it down below in the comments section.
