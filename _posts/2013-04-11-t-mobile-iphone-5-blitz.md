* A well-informed publication has published some interesting details regarding T-Mobile’s upcoming iPhone launch due on Friday, April 12. The Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier is said to be pulling out all the stops with a massively aggressive advertising blitz as plugged-in sources claim that  T-Mobile made a major ad buy between 8:35 and 8:40 local time tomorrow evening.
* And internal documents suggest that the carrier is dispersing at least 240,000 iPhone 5 units to company owned-retail stores for Friday morning. The carrier also confirmed the HTC One will be “coming soon” for $99 down payment and confirmed May 1 availability of the Galaxy S4 on May 1, but Apple watchers will no doubt be focused on first-day iPhone sales…
* TmoNews has more details on iPhone availability:
* As for availability overall, existing customers can buy one iPhone device per phone number in a 14 day period, regardless of full price or with EIP. Non T-Mobile customers can buy iPhones at the “Phone Only price” and are limited to two iPhone 5 devices per transaction.
* Looking at several pages of internal documents the publication posted, T-Mobile’s iPhone 5 variant will support both HSPA+ and LTE on the AWS bandwidths.

* Moreover, demo units should arrive today. Earlier in the week, the telco started rolling out a carrier bundle which enables network-specific features on the unlocked AT&T iPhones already hosted on its network, such as Visual Voicemail, HD Voice, LTE and more.
* The 16GB iPhone 5 will be available in both colors in all retail and branded locations, but 32GB/64GB versions will be available online only or via direct shipping, at least initially.
* Here’s a handy network compatibility list of T-Mobile’s iPhone 5 variant versus the existing AT&T model.

* As indicated before, T-Mobile will be encouraging people to buy the iPhone 5 by leveraging its device trade-in program on the iPhone 4/4S to offset out-of-pocket costs.
* The iPhone 5 will set you back $99.99 down and $20 per month over the next 24 months. The 32GB/64GB versions are $199/$299 down. The iPhone 4S is $70 down plus $20 per month for 24 months and the iPhone 4 costs $15 down and $15 per month over the next 24 months.
* T-Mobile has also stepped up the game with a new Simple Choice Plan which offers unlimited talk, text and web, with upgrades including unlimited data (an extra $20), a second line (an extra $30, or $10 a month for each additional line) and more.
* So, who’s standing in line tomorrow?
