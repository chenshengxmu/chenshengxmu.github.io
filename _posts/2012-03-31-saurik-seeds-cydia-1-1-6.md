* Those of you that appreciate a good prank might not want to install the new Cydia update. Saurik just announced that he has pushed out Cydia 1.1.6 to remove last year’s Twitter-inspired “dickbar” April Fools’ Day joke.
* For those of you unfamiliar with the holiday, April Fools’ Day falls on the first day of April and is celebrated around the world with good-natured pranks and hoaxes. But apparently not everyone has a sense of humor…
* Saurik explains:
* “For April Fools’ 2011, I did a Twitter-inspired “dickbar” in Cydia; I apparently never removed the code and it just checks for “April 1″. 🙁 As many users just get confused and angry regarding Cydia’s April Fools’ jokes, I have pushed Cydia 1.1.6 (which removes the obsolete code).”
* The move makes sense given that not everyone enjoys a practical joke as much as the next person. In fact, that’s the exact sentiment that keeps us from doing any kind of April Fools’ day posts here on iDB.
* The bottom line here is that if you don’t install the new update, you’ll likely see an annoying scrolling ad-like banner in Cydia starting tomorrow. But it will disappear the following day.
