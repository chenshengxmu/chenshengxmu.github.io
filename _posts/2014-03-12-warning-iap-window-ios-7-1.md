* Apple released iOS 7.1 earlier this week, and among its many other changes is a new warning message for users regarding the 15-minute in-app purchase window. The window allows you to buy IAPs on an iOS device for 15 minutes after a password is entered without authorization.
* The move is likely part of Apple’s efforts to make good on its settlement with the FTC regarding a lawsuit over IAPs. The company told the commission that it would issue refunds to those affected, and modify its in-app billing system to make the whole process more clear for users…
* As noted by AppleInsider, the pop-up gives users a direct link to the Settings application where they can apply restrictions for in-app purchases. They can choose to leave the 15-minute buy window alone, require a password for every purchase, or turn off in-app purchasing altogether.
* For its lawsuit settlement made with the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) in January, Apple agreed to refund over $30 million to those affected by ‘unauthorized purchases.’ It also agreed to make necessary changes to its App Store checkout and billing processes by the end of March.
* In addition to the FTC suit, Apple has faced a handful of class-action lawsuits from parents over its IAP policies. It’s also had to issue individual refunds to parents of up to $6000. It’ll be interesting to see if the changes it’s made in iOS 7.1 will finally put an end to this expensive headache.
