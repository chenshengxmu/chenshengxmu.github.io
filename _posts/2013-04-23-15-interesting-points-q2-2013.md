* Apple just announced its earnings for its first quarter of 2013, second fiscal quarter, and despite all of the lead-in ‘doom’ talk, the numbers are actually very impressive. The company beat Wall Street projections in nearly every metric.
* We’re just finishing up the conference call, where Tim Cook and company have made several announcements and dropped a number of impressive statistics. And as usual, we’ve rounded up the 15 most interesting points for you…
* The gist of the call is that Apple had a solid Q2 is seeing strong growth in iPad sales, and its ecosystem. Initially, the company’s stock was up several points in after hours trading, but it has since fall back down due to Cook’s comments.
* It sounds—again, going strictly off of Cook’s comments on the conference call—like Apple will not be releasing any new products until the fall of this year. Perhaps the company is going for another ‘all-at-once’ product release again this year.
