* Apple on Thursday kicked off its Hello Again event by announcing a new app it’s simply calling ‘TV.’ Tim Cook claimed that his team believes it will “completely change how you watch TV on your Apple TV as well as your iPhone and iPad.”
* The app, as rumored, is essentially a super TV guide that surfaces shows and movies from all of your apps. “The new TV app is the first place I go when I use my Apple TV.” Selecting a title within the TV app kicks you into its respective app.

* When you install a new app on your Apple TV, it’ll instantly sign you in with your cable single-sign on, and it’ll populate Watch Now with content. Unfortunately it looks like the rumors were true that Netflix hasn’t agreed to be part of the program.
* Fan of live sports? All you need to do is tell Siri to “turn on the game.” Siri knows which app has the game and takes you straight to the action. You can either request a specific game, like “the Cubs game,” or view a list all available streaming games.

* To be honest, this looks awesome. Can’t wait to try it out when it becomes available in December.
