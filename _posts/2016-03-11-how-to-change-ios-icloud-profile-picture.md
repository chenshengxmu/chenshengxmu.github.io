* Have you customized your iCloud profile photo yet? If not, you really should. Providing a custom image file as your iCloud profile photo will enhance your experience on Apple’s platforms.
* An iCloud profile photo appears as your account photo on iCloud.com in your browser.
* It’s also shown in iCloud preferences on iOS and macOS devices and in a number of places like Messages, Contacts and Mail and other apps that use profile pictures.
* In this quick tutorial, you’ll learn how to upload your profile photo to iCloud using the web interface, System Preferences on your Mac or the Settings app on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* Your iCloud profile photo appears in the following places:
* Additionally, the iCloud profile photo is pushed to other places, including apps that take advantage of profile photos. For instance, your iCloud profile photo makes it easier for Family Sharing members to identify your account in their list of family members.
* On the iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, your iCloud profile photograph can be uploaded via Settings → [YourAccount] or by updating the profile image on your own contact card.
* 1) Go to Settings → [YourAccount] on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap your iCloud account name at the top and provide your Apple ID password, if asked to.
* 3) Tap Edit below your profile picture.
* 4) Tap Take Photo if you wish to take a profile picture with your iOS’s device iSight or Face Time camera or hit Choose Photo to select an image from your photo library.
* 5) Using the pinch-zoom gesture, zoom in the image and drag it around to crop the shot perfectly. Tap Choose to accept the photo.
* 6) Tap Done in the upper right corner to save the changes.
* Your new profile picture should be now visible in the Settings interface. You cannot delete your iCloud profile picture through Settings.
* 1) Open Contacts on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap your contact card at the very top of the Contacts screen.
* 3) Tap the Edit button in the upper right corner and then tap Edit below the profile image on your contact card.

* 5) Select an action:
* 6) Tap Done to confirm the changes.
* Tip: To edit or delete the contact’s profile image, tap the picture and choose Edit Photo or Delete Photo in the pop-up menu.
* You can update your iCloud profile image on the Mac through the iCloud preference pane, in the Photo Booth app and by updating your contact card in Contacts.
* The profile picture for your macOS user account is adjustable separately of, and has nothing to do with your iCloud profile image. Images for Mac user accounts identify macOS users on the login and boot screen, in the Fast User Switching menu and the System Preferences → User & Groups preference pane.
* 1) Go to System Preferences → iCloud

* I’m going to select a photo in my iCloud Photo Library of myself wearing shades that I took recently on my iPhone 6s.
* 3) Using the slider at the bottom of the image, resize and reposition the photo to achieve that perfect crop.

* Now, that’s much better.
* Unfortunately, you cannot remove your profile picture through this interface.
* You can also update your profile picture and apply some cool effects through the stock Photo Booth app. In Photo Booth, first snap a photo of yourself with your Mac’s FaceTime camera, then click the Share button and choose Change Profile Picture.

* Now select if you wish to use this image as the profile photo on your social media accounts like Twitter and Facebook. We’re focusing on the two options at the bottom for deciding whether to use the image as your Messages buddy picture, your OS X user account’s profile image and on your contact card in Contacts.

* Telling Photo Booth to update the picture on your contact card will immediately set it as your new iCloud profile photo everywhere. Sadly, you cannot update your contact card/iCloud photo separately of the user picture for your user account on macOS.
* Tip: To show profile pictures in Mail, select “Show contact photos in the message list” in Mail → Preferences → Viewing. Your profile photo doesn’t go out with your emails, it’s only displayed on your Mac.
* To update your iCloud profile photo through your contact card: launch Contacts, select Card → Go To My Card, double-click the preview image and select an option:

* Tip: Or, drag an image file from the Finder and drop it on the Contacts window.
* Updating your contact card image automatically updates your iCloud profile picture on other iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac devices that use the same iCloud account. On the Mac, the maximum size of a contact photo is 224 KB. OS X supports the following file types for a contact photo: JPEG, BMP, PNG and GIF.
* 1) In a web browser, log in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID user name and password.
* 2) Click your profile name in the upper right corner of the window and select iCloud Settings in the pop-up menu.
* 3) Now click the image preview next to your Apple ID name and click Choose Photo, then select an image file on your computer to use as the new iCloud profile photo.

* Tip: You can also drag a file from the Finder containing a new photo and drop it into the photo editing pane.
* 4) Resize the photo by dragging the slider below the image, crop it by dragging the preview image to bring a different part into the frame or rotate the photo by clicking the arrow in its upper right corner.
