* One feature I really miss from iOS 6 is the Share Widget that would let you to add “Tap to Tweet” and “Tap to Post” buttons to Notification Center, allowing you to quickly send a tweet or post to Facebook.
* When the first iOS 7 beta versions were released, we all thought the widgets would make their way to the final release, but they didn’t. Today, we’re going to show you a workaround that allows you to quickly send a tweet or post to Facebook in iOS 7…
* First, I’d like to address the disappearance of the Share Widget in iOS 7. In iOS 6, you would find the Share Widget under Settings > Notifications. If you had the Share Widget on, and assuming you had signed in both Twitter and Facebook, you were able to quickly post to these two social networks by simply pulling down Notification Center from anywhere.
* When you think about it, it never really made sense for the Share Widget to be in Notification Center to begin with. Sharing to Twitter or Facebook has nothing to do with a notification. It simply was not at the right place there.
* A better place for the Share Widget would be Control Center. Just like you can quickly launch the Clock or Calculator apps from Control Center, it would definitely make more sense to have the Share Widget there than in Notification Center.
* At this point, I’m not sure whether Apple will ever bring the widget back or not. One thing’s for sure, it is greatly missed.
* To date, there is no way to quickly share to Facebook or Twitter from anywhere on your iOS device, but as often, there is a nice little workaround that will do the trick.
* The trick is to download a free application called MySocial Post. The app gives you a very basic, yet elegant way to quickly share to Facebook or Twitter using the built-in share sheets.
* Launch the app and let it connect to your Facebook and Twitter account, and you’re good to go. Either tap “Post” or “Tweet” to select what social network you want to update, type in some text and hit the “Post” button. At this point, you cannot send an update to both networks at the same time.
* From now on, should you want to share something really quick on Facebook or Twitter, you can simply launch this app and quickly get to the point without any distraction.
* I can already hear the angry mob complaining about how this is far from being as convenient as the original Share Widget or how it’s just as fast to simply launch the Twitter or Facebook app and update from there directly. As mentioned above, this is just a workaround. This is as good as it gets (and looks) when quickly sharing on iOS without having to launch the full Twitter/Facebook app.
* Now I’m wondering if it’d be possible for the developer to create a dummy notification that would stick to the “All” tab of Notification Center. This way, you’d be able to pull down Notification Center from anywhere, tap the dummy notification and launch MySocial Post. It doesn’t sound like too much asking, does it?
* If that’s something you could use, download MySocial Post in the App Store for free. Of course, if you use Launcher Center Pro, you can easily add shortcuts to quickly post to Twitter and Facebook from there.
