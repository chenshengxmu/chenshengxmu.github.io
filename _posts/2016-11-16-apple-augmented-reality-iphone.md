* Apple is integrating augmented reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app, reports Business Insider. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says the initiative involves teams from several acquired startups, and will serve as a stop-gap until its digital glasses are ready for market.
* By adding AR technology into the iPhone’s camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognized, according to the person familiar with the matter. That would require creating or licensing a database of 3D objects.
* Another early feature for Apple’s AR integration into the camera app could be to recognize and manipulate people’s faces. Apple integrated facial recognition technology into the photos app in the most recent version of its iOS software, and purchased FaceShift, a company with similar technology in 2015. 
* Eventually, the person said, after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers, like it did with its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. At that point, Apple will become a competitor to companies like Vuforia and Blippar. 
* Rounding out the report, BI adds on to Bloomberg’s claims regarding Apple’s digital glasses project. Pointing to the recent hiring of John Border, who describes himself as an expert in head-worn displays, camera systems and sensors, the site believes the glasses have moved beyond the exploration stage.
