* Apple last evening posted a new video to its official YouTube channel, offering a rare behind the scenes look at how the Portrait Lighting effects on iPhone X were created.
* Apple studied the art of portraiture photography, from paintings to photographs, so you don’t have to. They also worked with global image makers and the world’s best photographers to make the Portrait Lighting effects on iPhone X as close to the real thing as humanly possible.
* Combining timeless lighting principles with advanced machine learning, the power of the A11 Bionic chip and depth mapping is what ultimately makes this shooting mode possible.
* “Take a look behind the iPhone X and discover the process we went through to create Portrait Lighting,” reads the video’s description. “Combining timeless lighting principles with advanced machine learning, we created an iPhone that takes studio-quality portraits without the studio.”
