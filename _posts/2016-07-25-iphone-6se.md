* German blog Apfelpage.de has learned from sources in China who claim to have seen the next iPhone’s packaging that the forthcoming handset will be marketed under the ‘iPhone 6SE’ moniker rather than be called ‘iPhone 7’. Although the report is somewhat sketchy, such a move may not be without its merits.
* For starters, Apple is rumored to be switching to a three-year iPhone refresh cycle and, more importantly, the next iPhone seems to sport iterative enhancements and be very similar in appearance to the existing iPhone 6/6s lineup.
* The publication has additionally learned from sources its own that some of the Chinese accessory vendors may have already created product packaging with ‘iPhone 6SE’ label. For what it’s worth, the ‘iPhone 6SE’ moniker has reportedly been confirmed for a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model only.
* I don’t believe the next iPhone will be called ‘iPhone 6SE’ because the name could confuse would-be shoppers as it implies an iterative refresh to the iPhone SE rather than a brand new iPhone model, but who knows…
