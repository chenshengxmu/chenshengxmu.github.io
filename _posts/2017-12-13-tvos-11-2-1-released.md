* Apple followed up on today’s release of iOS 11.2.1 with the tvOS 11.2.1 update for Apple TV.
* The over-the-air update is available in Settings → System → Software Update on your fourth-generation Apple TV and Apple TV 4K. If you have optionally enabled automatic software updates in the Settings, your set-top box will be upgraded to tvOS 11.2.1 automatically.
* Like iOS 11.2.1, tvOS 11.2.1 restores remote access to HomeKit accessories for shared users. Apple TV had to be updated as well because the set-top box doubles as a hub for remote control of HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories from the Home app for iOS.

* HomeKit suffered from a vulnerability that permitted unauthorized access to HomeKit devices, such as smart locks, blinds and more. Although Apple fixed the bug server-side last week, it temporarily disabled remote HomeKit access.
* tvOS 11.2.1 has now restored that functionality.
