* Apple at Monday’s WWDC 2013 keynote briefly mentioned its refreshed AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule wireless appliances which now support Gigabit Wi-Fi, also known as 802.11ac, for three times throughput of 802.11an. In unveiling the sixth-generation AirPort Extreme, Apple’s marketing honcho Phil Schiller somewhat cryptically alluded that the redesigned base station might accept internal storage.
* “There’s also room in there for a hard drive,” he quipped. Sure enough, teardown wizards over at iFixit bought a brand spanking new unit and tore it apart, finding 3.5 inches of empty space inside…
* While the AirPort Extreme doesn’t come equipped with storage, this could potentially allow DIYers to slip in a standard 3.5 inch SATA hard drive and basically turn their AirPort Extreme into a Time Capsule. Unfortunately, iFixit couldn’t find any connectors to plug in the hard drive, only empty spaces on the logic board.

* As suggested by 9to5Mac, DIYers could “use the USB port and wire a bus-powered 2.5 inch hard drive (up to 2TB currently) or SSD around inside the case”.
* I’m sure the aftermarket is already busy solving the Extreme’s lack of the SATA/Power connectors on the board as we speak.
* Here’s a look at the top.

* Notice how the six antenna cables – three for the 2.4GHz band and three for the 5GHz band – run under the supposed hard drive slot into that big, shiny plate at the top, which also doubles as the antenna.
* By elevating the antennas, the new Extreme is able to optimize range and signal strength. The vertical design also allows for 64 percent smaller footprint at 4 inches square than its predecessor.

* On the back it has three Gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a Gigabit Ethernet WAN port and one USB 2.0 I/O.
* Apple’s AirPort Extreme web page doesn’t mention anything about internal storage upgrades apart from explaining that the USB port can be used to hook up a printer or an external USB hard drive for wireless sharing across your Wi-Fi network.
* I own the previous-generation Time Capsule and Airport Extreme, in addition to three AirPort Express base stations.
* I ran into tons of issues with other base stations, but none of Apple’s wireless appliances have ever failed me – th gadgets are reliable, stylish, work as advertised and are easy to set up using Mountain Lion’s built-in AirPort Utility or the free iOS app.
