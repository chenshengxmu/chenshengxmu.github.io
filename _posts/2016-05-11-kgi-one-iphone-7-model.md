* In somewhat surprising news, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo—arguably the most reliable Apple analyst out there—says there’ll be one, not two iPhone 7 Plus models. Previous rumors have pointed to three different configurations: a regular 4.7-inch ‘iPhone 7’, a larger-screened 5.5-inch ‘iPhone 7 Plus’ and a so-called ‘iPhone 7 Pro’ with premium hardware features.
* According to Kuo’s note to clients, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, Apple plans to produce a single iPhone 7 Plus model. That ‘Plus’ edition should be the ‘Pro’ iPhone you’ve been waiting for: it’ll come outfitted with a dual-lens camera system and have three gigabytes of RAM versus two gigabytes of RAM on the iPhone 6s generation.
* The analyst explains that more RAM will be needed in order to compensate for the increased image processing demands stemming from dual-lens cameras.
* “In a previous report, we said the new 5.5-inch iPhone model (referred to as iPhone 7 Plus), to be launched in the second half of 2016, may come in two versions: one with rear single-camera and the other with rear dual-camera,” reads the research note.
* “However”, Kuo writes, “we now believe Apple will only roll out the dual-camera version in the second half of this year, with 3GB RAM to meet image processing requirements.”
* He predicted new iPhone shipments at 20-30 million units in fiscal 2016.
