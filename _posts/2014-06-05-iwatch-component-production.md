* Cantor Fitzgerald’s Brian White reports that several components for the so-called iWatch are going into mass production this month. The analyst believes that Apple is planning to unveil the long-rumored smartwatch in September, perhaps alongside the iPhone 6.
* White bases his report on his recent tour of Computex, Asia’s largest technology show, where wearables were by far the most talked-about products. There, sources from supply chain companies told him iWatch component production would soon begin ramping up…
* MacRumors shares White’s note to investors:
* With the theme around wearable technology at Computex this year, our research has uncovered more data points as it relates to Apple’s “iWatch.” Our meeting with a tech supply chain company highlighted that initial production of certain “iWatch” components is scheduled to begin later this month and there are plans for a sharp acceleration into fall. 
* Given the trajectory of this ramp and our experience analyzing other product ramps at Apple, we expect the “iWatch” to be unveiled with the iPhone 6 in September. Since our research suggests the first iteration of the “iWatch” is more of a companion device, and thus requires a connection to an iPhone, we believe unveiling the two new devices at the same time makes sense.
* White says that the iWatch will be offered at several price points, similar to the iPhone and iPad, with an entry level model as low as $199. While that seems cheap compared to previous reports, that would allow it to better compete with the likes of Pebble and Samsung.
* We know very little about Apple’s smartwatch thus far, other than rumors have said it will come in two sizes: 1.3 and 1.5-inches and have a round face. It should also pair nicely with the newly-introduced iOS 8 ‘Health’ app, which will likely also be released in September.
