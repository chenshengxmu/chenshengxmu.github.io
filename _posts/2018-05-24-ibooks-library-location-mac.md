* You can use the iBooks app to read iBooks titles, iBooks Author books and PDF files.
* In addition to storing iBooks you’ve purchased, the app can also manage and sync PDFs so they are accessible across all your devices. If you use iCloud Drive with iBooks, any PDFs that you add to the app on your iOS device will automatically appear in iBooks on Mac and all of your other Apple devices, and vice versa.

* It might be a good idea to make backups of your iBooks by copying the files to a custom folder on your Mac and ensure that it’s included in your backup scheme.
