* Ferrari is one of the three CarPlay launch partners (along with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz) so we’re not shocked that a Ferrari sports vehicle has been spotted inside the Moscone West building and right in front of the keynote line.
* With CarPlay in iOS 8 allegedly gaining support for wireless connections between the vehicle and your iOS device – and who knows what else – this could signal Apple’s desire to take CarPlay mainstream and perhaps announce during the keynote additional CarPlay features/partners, expanded CarPlay availability, in-dash aftermarket solutions and what not…

* If I had to guess, I’d say we’re in for some more CarPlay news in the form of additional lineup of vehicles/car vendors supporting Apple’s automotive platform.
