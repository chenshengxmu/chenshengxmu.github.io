* Horns. They’re underrated little things, aren’t they? Design firm en&is clearly agrees, which is why it has come up with the MegaPhone, a horn-type affair which promises to improve the clarity and volume of whatever is coming out of your iPhone’s speakers.
* Yes, we’re serious…
* The description, translated from Italian by Google, explains the concept:
* “Amplifier passive ceramic iphone. The form is designed to amplify and optimize the best sound output. The amplifier is based on a thin wooden structure that allows the object to float off the table. This is to increase the vibration of the object being used and to optimize the emission of sound. Designed for the iPhone is perfect for listening to music without headphones, for audio conference to hear the person on the phone as if he were talking in the same room.”
* Now granted, the idea may seem a little weird, but few could argue that the MegaPhone isn’t one sexy piece of kit. The hand-made ceramic horn is a thing of beauty, and if this video is a real representation, the audio results aren’t too bad either.
* No word on pricing yet, but we can’t help but think it’s going to be a bit on the high side!
