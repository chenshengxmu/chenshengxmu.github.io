* Yesterday, Apple quietly announced the brand new (PRODUCT)RED colorway for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. In fact, Apple quietly announced quite a few updates to several different lines, including a small spec bump for the “iPad,” which is the new way to refer to the older “iPad Air” lineup. Updates aside, we can’t get our hands on any of it today, but we can celebrate with a (PRODUCT)RED wallpaper!
* The Wallpapers of the Week section via iDB is enhanced by our avid readers. Thanks so much to avid iDB reader @Axinen for the fast work and the iDB exclusive! To submit wallpapers, just catch up with me via @jim_gresham.

* Download these for iPhone, iPad, and desktop with the Apple logo Download these for iPhone, iPad, and desktop without the Apple logo
* For best rendering on iPhone Lock screen, we suggest choosing the “Still” option and zooming out on the image when first setting up this wallpaper. This will prevent the date and time from covering parts of the Apple logo.
* If you missed all of the hype from the new announcements, check out our round up video!
