* Apple on Monday released iOS 10.1.1, a minor update for all iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads with bug fixes.
* According to the Software Update page, iOS 10.1.1 simply fixes a problem where Health data would become unviewable for some users while trying to access it.
* You can upgrade to the new firmware over the air (OTA) via Settings → General → Software Update from the device itself or through iTunes as the update rolls out. The firmware is also available via our downloads page as always.
* iOS 10.1.1 comes one week after the public release of iOS 10.1, which brought the Portrait Mode photography feature to the iPhone 7 Plus, as well other improvements and bug fixes across the board for Apple’s lineup of iPhones and iPads.
* By the looks of things, the Health data bug wasn’t very common, but it was a problem nevertheless. Were you one of the ones affected by the bug?
