* Folks excited to checkout all of the new features in OS X Yosemite will be happy to hear that a developer preview will be available today, for free [obviously]. It sounds like it’s going to be available for all registered developers at first, and eventually hit Apple’s recently launched public beta program. As usual, we’ll let you know as soon as the download is available.
