* OS X 10.11 El Capitan is launching tomorrow and Apple just issued a reminder in the form of a media release alerting customers of the impending update.
* “Apple today announced that OS X El Capitan, the latest major release of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, will be available on Wednesday, September 30 as a free update for Mac users,” reads the press release.
* Will you be taking the plunge?
* The free of charge software update will be distributed exclusively through the Mac App Store. El Capitan supports all Macs introduced in 2009 and later, and some models introduced in 2007 and 2008.
* “People love using their Macs, and one of the biggest reasons is the power and ease-of-use of OS X,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering.
* “El Capitan refines the Mac experience and improves performance in a lot of little ways that make a very big difference. Feedback from our OS X beta program has been incredibly positive and we think customers are going to love their Macs even more with El Capitan.”
* He’s right about the feedback.
* Though I normally hold off until the first service update becomes available for any  major OS X releases, I’ll be making an exception this time around as El Capitan betas run smoothly and without major hiccups on my 2013 MacBook Air.
* In the meantime, here are some resources you might find useful:
* Keep your eyes peeled, as we’ll be posting a number of how-tos covering upgrading to El Capitan and other tutorials to get you up to speed with Apple’s latest and greatest desktop operating system.
