* We know, we know, the wait is killing us, but all we have to relieve the tension is a few tweets from the “Dream Team” of iOS hackers working on the jailbreak for A5 devices, namely the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2.
* The latest update is a tweet from planetbeing revealing that the A5 jailbreak is out of the sandbox, which means we should see the jailbreak released very soon…
* And we’re out of the sandbox with @saurik‘s invaluable help! (well, at least there’s a PoC) 😀 Turning out more complex than X-Gold 618.

* The “X-Gold 618” mention is a reference to the iPhone 4 baseband chip that planetbeing helped crack with MuscleNerd.
* Separately, Joshua Hill (or p0sixninja) of the Chronic Dev Team has informed iDB that “All blocking issues have been solved. We just need to integrate things now.” He noted that this is a “very complicated jailbreak with lots of interworking parts.”
* While older devices like the iPhone 4 and original iPad already have an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1, the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2 have proven more difficult to hack. It’s just a matter of time now.
