* Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, the third and final installment in the “Night at the Museum” movie series, is premiering later this month and an official tie-in iOS game is now available for download in the App Store.
* Night at the Museum: Hidden Treasures for the iPhone and iPad is a hidden object adventure game that puts you in the shoes of Larry, a night guard from the movie who gets to explore the museum’s hidden secrets, exhibits from Camelot, ancient Egypt, imperial China and more.
* In his quest, Larry will team up with some of the most significant figures in human history such as Teddy Roosevelt, Atilla the Hun and Joan of Arc. If you’re a fan of the movie, this tie-in game should be a no-brainer.
* For those who haven’t watched “Night at the Museum” movies, the series follows adventures of Larry Daley (Ben Stiller), a divorced father who works as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History where an ancient curse has caused the museum’s “inhabitants” to come to life.
* The game looks pretty nice and appealing, especially in terms of cinematic graphics with colorful backdrops, fun dialogue between characters and challenging search boards.
