* Apple on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is today, announced its Everyone Can Code curriculum is expanding to 8 schools serving deaf, blind or visually impaired students.
* “Apple is celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day by making coding more inclusive for students across the country,” CEO Tim Cook tweeted out this morning. “Because when we say Everyone Can Code, we mean everyone.”
* Accessible coding is coming to select schools beginning this fall:
* Assistive technologies like VoiceOver permit vision-impaired students to use Swift Playgrounds without needing to see the screen. Students with physical motor limitations can use Swift Playgrounds through Apple’s built-in Switch Control, which enables switches, joysticks and other adaptive devices to control what is on your screen.
* Tim Cook said that all students deserve an opportunity to learn the language of technology. “We hope to bring Everyone Can Code to even more schools around the world serving students with disabilities,” he was quote as saying.

* The company will be providing additional tools and resources to schools and students, such as tactile maps to enhance the understanding of coding environments for non-visual learners.
* Global Accessibility Awareness Day, the 3rd Thursday each May, promotes digital accessibility and inclusion for people with all disabilities. In its celebration, Apple today showcased the key accessibility features in its products through a dedicated webpage.
