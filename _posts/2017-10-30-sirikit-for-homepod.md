* Apple announced today that iOS 11.2 introduces SiriKit for HomePod, allowing developers to extend the wireless speaker’s natural voice interaction through custom features.
* With SiriKit for HomePod, users can conveniently access SiriKit-compatible iPhone and iPad apps that support voice interactions for domains like Messaging, Lists and Notes.
* In other words, you’ll be able to tell your HomePod to text someone using Messages or send a message via WeChat or another compatible app, add an item to your shopping list or create a quick note that says “hi” in Evernote, for example.
* According to Apple, Siri recognizes SiriKit requests made on HomePod and sends those requests to the user’s iOS device for processing. To test their custom commands, developers can use Siri through headphones on an iPhone or iPad with the iOS 11.2 beta.
* “Siri handles all of the user interaction, including the voice and natural language recognition, and works with your extension to get information and handle user requests,” added Apple.
* Apple today also updated the HomePod firmware. While we couldn’t verify this at post time, support for SiriKit on HomePod is likely included in the new HomePod firmware.
* SiriKit on HomePod is “coming soon.”
