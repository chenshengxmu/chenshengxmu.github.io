* Upcoming iPhone software could take GPS data and information from the internet to provide location and situation-aware calendar events and notifications, if a recently released patent application from Apple ever comes to fruition.
* Discovered by AppleInsider, and entitled “Dynamic Alerts for Calendar Events” the patent was first applied for back in 2009 but Apple haven’t put it to any useful use. Yet…

* One of the many uses for such a technology would include the notification of when a user could expect to arrive at a venue specified in a calendar event. GPS data, as well as information such as weather conditions and traffic could be plugged into the service to achieve an accurate estimation of how long a journey could take, with the results expressed by a pop-up notification on an iOS device.
* Imagine a notification telling you that due to a traffic accident you might want to set off for your dentist appointment 15 minutes early. Oh, and you might want to take a different route – iOS has one to recommend thanks to its new and improved maps feature previously mentioned by Apple.
* Apple’s system would rely on a variety of available data to ensure that users arrive at their meeting on time, taking into consideration weather, changing road conditions, or public transportation schedules.
* Those new maps could take into consideration crowd-sourced traffic feedback, with millions of iOS devices providing anonymised data on where they are and how long it’s taken them to travel a given distance. Given the recent furor over the way our smart-phones keep tabs on us though, this could well be scuppered.
* Could we possibly see something like this put in an appearance when Apple shows off iOS 5 at WWDC next week?
