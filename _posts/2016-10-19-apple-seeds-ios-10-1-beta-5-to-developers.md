* Apple on Wednesday morning released a fifth beta of iOS 10.1 for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus only. The latest beta came out two days after the release of iOS 10.1 beta 4 on Monday.
* iOS 10.1 beta 5 is available as an over-the-air download on an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with a prior beta. Today’s iPhone 7-focused release likely contains a cellular connectivity bug that Apple patched with an emergency update on October 17. macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 5 also released today.
* iOS 10.1 beta 5 (build “14B72c”) does not contain any new user-facing options aside from a Portrait mode in the stock Camera app on dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus models and a new setting to allow Messages animations when Reduce Motion has been enabled, both of which debuted in prior betas.
* The developer-only release is available to members of the Apple Developer Program. A standalone installer is available on Apple’s portal for developers. A public beta for those enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program is also available.
* A Portrait feature debuted in the first iOS 10.1 beta. When iOS 10.1 releases for public consumption, iPhone 7 Plus owners will be able to capture DSLR-like depth of field photographs like the one seen top of post.

* iOS 10.1 also includes a switch for enabling the Reduce Motion feature while retaining the new iMessage screen and bubble effects. This lets you turn off parallax and other UI effects while keeping animations in Messages.
* We’ll be updating this post with any potential changes as we encounter them.
