* Facebook may be bringing its popular messaging app to the desktop, according to a blurry photo obtained by TechCrunch which appears to show a native application being tested on a Mac notebook by an employee.
* Facebook currently provides the Messenger app for a number of mobile platforms, in addition to a dedicated web interface at messenger.com and built-in messaging functionality available through its desktop UI at facebook.com.
* “TechCrunch has obtained photographic evidence and an eyewitness report that Facebook has built an as-yet-unreleased Facebook Messenger For Mac desktop app,” reads the report.
* The blurry photo top of post apparently shows a Facebook employee using the pre-release software. The app reportedly includes Messenger branding in both the app icon in the Dock and in the menu bar. There’s also a navigation tab bar in the bottom left that matches options in the official iOS app, such as Recent, Groups, People and Settings.
* I, for one, would love to use the official Messenger app on my Mac. When I’m on a computer, I prefer not to reach out for my iPhone just to send messages to people.
* Apple’s Messages app is available on the Mac, as is Viber which provides a desktop app. With a native Messenger app, Mac users should experience much smoother performance that doesn’t require a browser. On top of that, a native Mac app should be a good citizen on OS X and support features like Split View multitasking, native full-screen support, Notification Center integration and more.
* How do you feel about this rumored Messenger for Mac app? Is this something that you envision using on your Mac on a regular basis?
