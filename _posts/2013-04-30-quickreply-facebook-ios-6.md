* Good news today for jailbreakers who frequently use Facebook’s Messenger application. Moeseth has updated his popular QuickReply tweak for the social network’s messaging service to be compatible with devices running iOS 6+.
* Much like its older sibling, TwitkaFly, QuickReply for Messenger allows users to quickly reply to Facebook messages by tapping on incoming notifications from either the Home screen, Lock screen, or within open applications…
* There’s not much to the tweak itself. Once installed, you can access its options from within the Settings app. These options include attaching your Facebook account, enabling or disabling the tweak, and choosing an icon/delivery sound.

* With the package enabled, you’ll see the above interface every time you tap on Facebook Messenger banner notifications. From here, you can quickly reply to the message, or select the ‘Open’ option to read the full message in the app.
* Again, there’s nothing groundbreaking here. But if you liked the tweak for iOS 5, you’ll definitely want to grab it for iOS 6. You can find QuickReply for Messenger in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for $1.99 (there is a free 3-day trial).
