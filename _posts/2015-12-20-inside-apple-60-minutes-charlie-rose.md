* CBS has posted video of its Inside Apple interview conducted by 60 Minutes’ Charlie Rose. The interview encompasses a wide range of subjects such as Apple’s design studio activity, following Steve Jobs, the success of the Apple Watch, China, and much more.
* True, most of the content consists of softball questions, and there’s really nothing new to be gleaned here that we didn’t already know. Still, it’s a highly-calculated, yet nevertheless interesting, look inside Ive’s design studio, Apple management meetings, and other behind-the-scenes clips. In other words, if you’re a fan of Apple, it’s basically must-see TV.
* What’s nice is that 60 Minute’s website includes the full transcript of the interview. Here are a few of the talking points that I found interesting:
* Charlie Rose: Is there danger of one product cannibalizing the other product?
* Phil Schiller: It’s not a danger, it’s almost by design. You need each of these products to try to fight for their space, their time with you. The iPhone has to become so great that you don’t know why you want an iPad. The iPad has to be so great that you don’t know why you why you want a notebook. The notebook has to be so great, you don’t know why you want a desktop. Each one’s job is to compete with the other ones.

* To Rose’s credit, he did try hard to draw Tim out about the current state of Apple Watch:
* Charlie Rose: You think it’s a product that needs improvement?
* Tim Cook: I think all products are–going to be–
* Charlie Rose: I know that. Of course I know that.
* Tim Cook: Yeah. And– I think the watch is no exception to that, is we’re– we’re gonna–continue to fine tune–
* Charlie Rose: So you’re disappointed–in some of the things.
* Tim Cook: I’m not disappointed in it. It’s every par–
* Charlie Rose: But you saw room to improve it?
* Tim Cook: Charlie, when we launch a product, we’re already working on the next one. And possibly even the next, next one. And so yes, we always see things we can do.

* Executive team 9:00AM meeting
* Be sure to head over to 60 Minutes’ web site to watch the full two-part series. Although no major new insight is gained, it’s still very interesting to see behind walls that most people never get to see. It’s also fascinating just to witness the key members of the executive team all gathering together for their 9:00 AM daily meeting.

* Newly appointed COO, Jeff Williams, gets some screen time
* Unfortunately, 60 Minutes is still stuck in the past, and as such, the video is only available with Flash installed. We’re not going to even bother embedding the video, as it won’t work on iOS devices. Instead, just visit this link when you’re on a desktop browser with Flash enabled in order to watch. Or you can wait until it inevitably shows up on YouTube.
* What are your thoughts on this look inside Apple’s secretive walls?
