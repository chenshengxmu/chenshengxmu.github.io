* Just in time for the all-important holiday shopping seasons, Apple appears to have now mostly solved its supply chain issues that have plagued availability of the new iPhone X.
* Following last weeks improvement to 2-3 weeks, most iPhone X models are now able to be shipped out within 1-2 weeks., according to Apple’s online stores in the United States and around the world.
* Those who have ordered their iPhone X are also seeing improvements over the original estimates. This comes at the perfect time as well approach the holiday season.
* Apple no doubts wants to sell as many iPhone Xs as possible, especially to make up for the fact the HomePod was delayed until early 2018.
