* Yesterday, iDB reported that T-Mobile’s iPhone 5 is actually a factory tweaked version of the existing AT&T model A1428 device, with support for T-Mobile’s LTE AWS bandwidths. As a result, existing AT&T customers cannot use their iPhone 5 to take full advantage of T-Mobile’s LTE speeds until after the Deutsche Telekom-owned telco launches its iPhone 5 on April 12, at which point Apple will replace the existing A1428 hardware with this re-tooled version.
* But a hack has come along claiming to make AT&T’s A1428 iPhone 5 – jailbroken and unlocked (officially or unofficially) – work on T-Mobile’s LTE on the 1700MHz band. It accomplishes this by using a custom carrier firmware that enables support for T-Mobile’s LTE AWS bandwidths. However, it won’t make your AT&T device compatible with T-Mobile’s speedy 3G DC-HSDPA on the 1700MHz band nor will your Verizon iPhone be fooled into accepting T-Mobile’s LTE bands…
* LEI Mobile takes us through the process of enabling T-Mobile LTE support on your AT&T iPhone 5 hardware.

* It involves adding a new repository to Cydia, editing some strings and loading a custom carrier file.
* Judging by the comments on the LEI Mobile post, the trick indeed works.
* The method could save some money to AT&T users looking to jump ship come April 12 as they won’t necessarily have to purchase an iPhone 5 from T-Mobile to enjoy T-Mobile’s LTE.
* Again, the trick won’t make your AT&T iPhone work on T-Mobile’s speedy 3G DC-HSDPA 42Mbps network.
* Why’s that important?
* Because with initially scarce availability of T-Mobile’s LTE (Baltimore, Houston, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Jose, and Washington DC), you’d want to be able to fall back to DC-HSDPA whenever you find yourself outside T-Mobile’s LTE coverage. T-Mobile plans to roll out LTE to a hundred million customers by mid-2013 and 200 million people nationwide by year’s end.
* Moreover, the hack supports neither T-Mobile’s slower 21Mbps HSPA+ network nor the twice as fast 42Mbps DC-HSDPA one.
* On the flip side, MacWorld was able to confirm with Apple that customers using a CDMA iPhone 5 (model A1429) from Verizon, Sprint and other regional CDMA carriers can use T-Mobile’s 21Mbps HSPA+ network, though not its DC-HSDPA or LTE networks.
* If these shortcomings sound annoying, you should definitely employ a waiting tactics and buy your device from T-Mobile come April 12.
* “If you want to purchase an unlocked iPhone 5 that can work fully on either AT&T or T-Mobile, your best bet is to wait a couple weeks until the newest iPhone 5 arrives,” MacWorld cautions.
* T-Mobile’s tweaked A1428 iPhone 5 supports both its 4G LTE and 3G DC-HSPA+ on AWS bandwidths, allowing the handset to fallback fast when you detach from LTE in a T-Mobile market where both networks are available.
* Apple officially confirmed to Engadget that it will be phasing out the existing A1428 model iPhone to replace it with the tweaked A1428 model which supports both AT&T and T-Mobile.
* An Apple spokesperson told the publication that the company cannot just roll out a software update to existing A1428 iPhone owners because the necessary firmware tweak has to be applied at the factory.
* “Apple affirmed to us that it’s not something that can be enabled via a simple software update for A1428 iPhone units already in circulation,” per Engadget.
* So, what do you make of all this?
