* Circlet, a new stylish Status Bar indicators tweak we recently previewed in now available in Cydia.
* Developed by Julian Weiss, this jailbreak tweak allows you to theme your Status Bar signal, Wi-Fi and battery indicator without the use of WinterBoard. Weiss notes in the description of the tweak that it is very lightweight, as “every “circlet” is generated as needed, without any assets saved,” and no respring is necessary.
* Jeff had a first look at Circlet a few days ago, and this is what he had to say about it:
* Circlet is available in the BigBoss repo for $0.99. If you decide to give Circlet a download, please let us know what you think about it in the comments section.
