* Pandora on Wednesday launched an application for the new Apple TV. You can find it by navigating to the App Store in tvOS, and scrolling through the Featured page where Apple currently has the app highlighted in the ‘Best New Apps’ category.
* The new tvOS client is obviously somewhat limited compared to its iOS counterpart, but it will allow you to sign into your Pandora account and listen to your customized Radio stations. You can also access tabs like Create Station and Now Playing.

* As you can see in the above screenshots, the Pandora Apple TV app features a very light, minimal design that is dominated by artwork. Unfortunately, you still have to use the stock tvOS keyboard to do things like login to your account and perform searches.
* Pandora is one of the most popular streaming services in the world, with nearly 80 million monthly users, and a proper Apple TV app has long been a wish list item for users. In November, the company announced its acquisition of Rdio assets for $75 million.
