* Premium (and Apple-exclusive) accessory maker Twelve South has announced a new charging stand made from metal and compatible with Apple’s iOS devices outfitted with Lightning I/O, such as the iPad mini, iPhone 5, fifth-generation iPod touch and the latest iPod nano.
* The desktop stand secures your device in place while providing an adjustable angle for a nice visual match with your iMac, MacBook or Thunderbolt Display. Oh, and it’s made from brushed metal to complement your other Apple devices perfectly. Jump past the fold for the full reveal and gorgeous hires shots…
* The accessory maker touts the HiRise in a blog post:
* Voice calls, Skype and even music sound crystal clear because, unlike other docks, HiRise does not block or interfere with the downward-firing speakers at all.
* While working at your desk, HiRise keeps favorite apps front-and-center, displaying news, weather and sports alerts as they happen. HiRise fits in great in the office and anywhere else you park your iPhone, like a bedside table or kitchen counter.
* The iPad mini + the HiRise stand = winning combo (especially when paired with an Apple Wireless Keyboard).

* The metal pedestal parks and elevates your device for FaceTime/Skype video chats, hands-free calls, desktop charging, viewing apps and streaming music without blocking iPhone’s speakers, mic or headphone port. You can adjust the device forward and back when docked in order to accommodate the different thicknesses of various cases and shells.

* Speaking of cases, the HiRise is compatible “with most cases”, thanks to an adjustable post, including those with recessed connections. The stand comes with three different adjustable clips and positions the Lightning connector at a raised height to seamlessly connect and charge your device.
* It’s the ultimate stand and I want to put it on my kitchen counter!
* The HiRise for the iPhone 5/ iPad mini is available now for $34.99 from the Twelve South webstore.
