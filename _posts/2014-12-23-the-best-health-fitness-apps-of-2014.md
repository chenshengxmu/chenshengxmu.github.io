* Even if you are not big on exercising, you have to admit that, with the launch of HealthKit and the Health app, people got a little more excited about their morning jog than they used to. Plus, with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus M8 motion coprocessor barometer feature, you can now track your stair climbing, too.
* We tracked down the best health and fitness apps to launch on iOS in 2014 so you don’t have to do as much work. Then, we drew straws to see who got to choose the winner. The resulting top health and fitness app, plus the runner-ups, and the best fitness app of all time, are listed for your reading enjoyment below.

* Carrot is my favorite personal assistant. She wakes you up in the morning, makes sure you get your chores completed, and can even motivate you to work out. This particular app includes the popular 7-minute workout regimen, which Carrot will politely remind you that you are not fit enough to complete. Log your weight every day to keep track of your progress. The seven-minute workout session features 12 30-second exercises with 10 seconds of rest in between. When you complete workouts and loose weight, Carrot will reward you by unlocking items like upgrades. Carrot does sync with the Health App, so you can send the data stored to other health and fitness services. This app is available for $2.99.

* Just because you want to get fit, doesn’t mean your fitness tracker has to be a sweaty mess. The makers of Runkeeper launched a walking app that looks as good as it works. Track your movements over the week and see just how much exercise you get. The app will then analyze the data and assign you a spirit animal. You can set goals to slowly get you into the habit of walking more. If you aren’t meeting those goals, you’ll receive a notification. If you already use RunKeeper, the data from Breeze will automatically be sent to it so you can track both your high-impact activity, and your leisurely strolls through the park. This app is available for free.

* For insight into your daily activities, you can give Lark access to your Health app, as well as the motion data stored on your M chip. The app analysis your information, like how many steps you’ve walked or ran, your sleep cycle, and calorie intake. Then, gives you a gentle nudge by telling you how your health and fitness compares to that of the average Lark user. You can tell the app what your goals are – to lose weight, stay healthy, or get fit – and chart your progress in the daily activity section. You walking and running actions are also charted by the time of day, so you can see when you are most active and adjust your exercises accordingly. This app is available for free.

* No matter what new-fangled technology comes out regarding health and fitness in the App Store, there is always going to be one particular app that makes us feel like we could climb any mountain. MyFitnessPal is an all-in-one calorie counter, fitness tracker, and food watcher. Access the huge food database to calculate the number of calories per meal you’ve taken in. Or, submit your own food item by adding detailed information about fat, carbs, protein, and more. Get workout advice by browsing through hundreds of exercises in both cardio and strength training. Customize your daily intake goals based on what results you wish to see. Data can be shared in the Health App so you can combine information with other services. This app is available for free.
