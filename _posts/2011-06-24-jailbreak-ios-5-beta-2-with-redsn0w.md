* Apple just dropped iOS 5 Beta 2, and, of course, one of the first questions that comes to mind is: can we jailbreak it?
* The answer came from Dev Team frontman MuscleNerd who confirmed that it is still possible to jailbreak iOS 5 Beta 2 using the latest version of RedSn0w, the same that was released a couple weeks ago to jailbreak iOS 5 Beta 1â€¦
* Of course, a lot of things are going to be broken so developers only should take the jailbreak road for iOS 5 Beta 2 so far, but if you like adventures, feel free to go ahead.
* In order to jailbreak iOS 5 Beta 2, you will have to use RedSn0w and point it to iOS 5 Beta 1. As usual, you can read our complete step-by-step RedSn0w guide. Note that, for legal reasons, we cannot post links to the beta downloads.
* This is still a tethered jailbreak, which means you will have to plug your iPhone in every time you reboot.
* Have you done it yet? Let us know by leaving a comment below.
