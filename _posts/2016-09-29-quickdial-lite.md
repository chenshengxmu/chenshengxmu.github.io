* QuickDial Lite is a new free jailbreak tweak intended for iPhones that allows you to quickly dial up to 9 of your favorite phone numbers in fewer keystrokes.
* With this tweak, you can assign certain phone numbers to individual number keys on the keypad in the Phone app. Afterwards, you will be able to tap and hold on any of those assigned keys to automatically initiate a phone call to the number assigned to the key you held down.
* QuickDial Lite will add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can assign your 9 favorite phone numbers by typing them in:

* It’s not mandatory to fill all 9 phone number text fields. You can have anywhere from 1-9 numbers assigned and the tweak will still work as expected.
* In our example, if we tap and hold on the #1 key in the Phone app’s keypad, QuickDial Lite is going to automatically begin calling the phone number 1-800-644-3825, as we have it assigned in the settings shown above.
* This tweak works wonders for support hotlines, such as for AppleCare or for your car insurance. These numbers aren’t quite personal enough that everyone wants them in their Contacts app, but they are something lots of people need in a jiffy. This tweak gives you a way to store and use those numbers without cluttering your Contacts app.
* To give QuickDial Lite a try, you can head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repository and pick up the tweak for free.
* Do you think you could put QuickDial Lite to good use on your jailbroken iPhone? Let us know in the comments.
