* Konami today announced that its popular card trading game, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links, will be launching on the iPhone and iPad this winter.
* Based on both the manga Yu-Gi-Oh!, which was serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1996, and the fifth iteration of the Yu-Gi-Oh!, the game promises to kindle the spirit of Yami Yugi, Seto Kaiba and other famous characters from the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise in competitive card battle action.
* The game packs in digital counterparts of more than 700 authentic Yu-Gi-Oh! cards so you can construct your ultimate deck and challenge other players in real-time duels.
* “The essence of Yu-Gi-Oh! is re-imagined for mobile as players can battle Duelists from all over the world by Summoning monsters, Traps and Spells in an effort to reduce their opponent’s life points toward victory,” promises Konami.
* Here’s the game’s teaser trailer.
* As you encounter new challenges, you’ll unlock additional characters. The game includes voiceover by familiar actors that lent their voice acting talent to the Yu-Gi-Oh! animated series in the United States.
