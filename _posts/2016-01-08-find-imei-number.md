* There are many scenarios where you will need your iPhone’s IMEI number. One of the most common is when you want to purchase a third-party carrier unlock so that you can use your iPhone with another carrier other than the one it’s programmed to work with from the factory. In this tutorial, we’ll show you three different ways that you can find your IMEI number with ease. 
* If you’re wondering how to find your iPhone’s IMEI number, it’s not necessary to install any fancy software to find it; in fact, it’s not even necessary to plug your iPhone into a computer. You can simply follow the following steps to find it:
* Step 1: Open the Settings application on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Tap on the General cell.
* Step 3: Tap on the About cell.

* If either of the above methods don’t match your style, you can also use the Phone application on your iPhone and simply dial a specific sequence. To do this, you must:
* Step 1: Launch the Phone application on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Go to the “Keypad” tab so you can enter the sequence.
* Step 3: Dial *#06#.
* Step 3: An interface will appear with your IMEI number. Unfortunately you can’t easily copy it from there.
* Now that you’ve found your IMEI number using one of the above three methods, you can give a third-party unlock service your IMEI number and they’ll be able to unlock your iPhone for use with another carrier, typically within just a few days.
