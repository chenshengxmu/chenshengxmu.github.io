* The Japanese business site Nikkei is reporting that Apple is in discussions with chipmaker Renesas Electronics concerning taking over their division that builds mobile display chips, Renesas SP Drivers.
* The deal should enable Tim Cook & Co. to bring another technological piece under their roof and help Apple’s engineers “improve image sharpness and battery life” on iPhones.
* Renesas Electronics is included on the official list of Apple’s suppliers. Apple is known for investing in its partners and suppliers when it makes sense. For instance, the company holds a ten percent stake in UK’s fabless semiconductor maker Imagination Technologies which provides blueprints for GPUs used in iOS devices…
* Nikkei has the story:
* Apple has its eye on Renesas SP Drivers, a Renesas joint venture with Sharp and Taiwan’s Powerchip. Apple is said to be seeking Renesas’ entire 55 percent stake for an estimated 50 billion yen ($479 million).
* The Tokyo company appears to have logged a profit of six billion yen on sales of some 60 billion yen in the fiscal year ended Monday.
* Apple aims to complete the acquisition by summer.
* The company is thought to retain most of the unit’s 240 employees in Japan for in-house development of the Renesas SP chips. Nikkei reminds us that Apple gets all of its iPhone liquid crystal display chips from Renesas SP.
* According to the official Renesas SP Drivers website, the firm specializes in building LCD drivers for small and mid-sized LCD panels. LCD drivers affect a display’s quality and performance and are said to account for around ten percent of battery usage.

* An interesting rumor dated February 1, 2014 claimed Renesas was withdrawing from the LCD chip business by selling off its LCD driver chip subsidiary.
* Responding to the rumor, the firm issued a non-denial saying the reports couldn’t be confirmed or regarded as fact. It’s interesting that Sony, another Apple supplier, reportedly wanted to devour Renesas last year.
* Not only do we now know that the rumor was true after all, it would now appear that a mystery buyer was actually Apple.
* I hope this means the next iPhone is going to have a longer battery life.
