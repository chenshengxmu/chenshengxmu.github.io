* Don’t you hate it when it’s late at night, and you forget to turn on silent mode before plugging your iPhone in to charge? The audible alert that results seems loud enough to wake up the whole residence!
* Sadly there’s no native way to totally disable the charging alerts, but don’t fret, the jailbreak community has your back.
* PowerSoundDisabler is a jailbreak tweak that disables the charging sound and vibration notification whenever you plug your iPhone or other iOS device into a power source.
* Once installed, there’s nothing to configure or setup, it starts working immediately. Go ahead, try it; plug in your iPhone and you won’t hear or feel a thing.
* PowerSoundDisabler can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Do you have plans to use this tweak?
