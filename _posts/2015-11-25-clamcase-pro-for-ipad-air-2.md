* ClamCase has come a long way since its first-generation iPad case. It is now ultra thin, has a better hinge system, and has arguably the best typing experience you can get on a tablet.
* The ClamCase Pro is designed specifically for the iPad Air 2 and has new features that make it even better than its predecessors. It also now comes in three different colors to match your style.
* The ClamCase is known for its 360-degree hinge system. You can open the case to use it in a traditional laptop position with the keyboard in front. Or, flip it over so that the keyboard lays flat underneath and your iPad Air 2 can be used for watching movies in landscape mode. Lay the device flat against the backside of the shell to use it in tablet position with the keys on the backside. Donâ€™t worry, the keyboard automatically shuts off when the hinge flips backward.
* It is made from an aluminum interior enclosure with a polycarbonate shell and soft, rubberized hinge.
* It has island style keys, similar to that on the MacBook Air and features a number of special media keys designed specifically for the iPad Air 2, like a Home screen key, volume controls, access to Siri, and even cut/paste shortcut keys.
* The ClamCase comes in silver, black, or gold and is available for $150 on Amazon. The price is a little steep, but ClamCase is known for providing the most natural typing experience on an iPad and it might just be worth the extra money if you need to use your tablet for productivity activities a lot.
