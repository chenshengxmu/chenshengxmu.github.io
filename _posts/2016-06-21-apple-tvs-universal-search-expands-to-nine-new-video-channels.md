* After adding support for video content from Bravo, E!, Syfy and USA channels ten days ago, tvOS’s universal search feature was refreshed earlier today with official support for nine additional channels. The full up-to-date list of universal search providers can be found in Apple’s support document.
* As first reported by MacRumors, A&E, Cooking Channel, DIY, Food Network, FYI, HGTV, History, Lifetime and Travel Channel now surface their content in search results when using the Apple TV’s universal search feature.
* Owners of the fourth-generation Apple TV who have installed one of these apps on their device can use their Siri Remote or the Search app to find shows from these newly added sources, which will be surfaced in their search results.
* After today’s expansion, the following content providers are currently supported by tvOS’s universal search feature:
* tvOS 10, which is currently available as a developer-only beta, has built-in support for searching YouTube with Siri. To search for YouTube content, use Siri and include the word “YouTube” in your search.
* The Search app doesn’t search YouTube.
* tvOS 10 will release for public consumption this fall as a free over-the-air update for the fourth-generation Apple TV.
