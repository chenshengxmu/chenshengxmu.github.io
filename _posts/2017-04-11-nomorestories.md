* Facebook has made a lot of unwanted changes to the mobile app in the last few weeks; unfortunately, because they refuse to list anything new in the App Store change logs, everyone who uses Facebook gets duped into installing the changes whether they want them or not.
* One of the latest unpopular additions to the Facebook app is the Snapchat-like Stories feature, which appears at the top. If you don’t like Facebook’s new Stories feature, you can use a new free jailbreak tweak called NoMoreStories by iKilledAppl3 to get rid of it once and for all.
* As you can see above, the tweak eliminates the unwanted feature from the app, helping to clean it up a bit so you can look at more of what you care about and less of what you don’t.
* After installation, NoMoreStories adds a preferences pane to the Settings app for toggling Stories on or off and hiding or showing the live video tab in the toolbar at the bottom of the app:

* Both settings require a respring to take effect, so you’ll find a complimentary “Apply Changes” button at the bottom of the preferences pane for saving the settings you choose.
* If you’re interested in downloading NoMoreStories, the tweak is available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken devices that can run the latest version of the Facebook app, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store if you don’t have it installed already.
