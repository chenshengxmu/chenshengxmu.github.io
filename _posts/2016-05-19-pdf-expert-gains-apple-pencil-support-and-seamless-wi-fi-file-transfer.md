* Now you can take the most from your Apple Pencil and iPad Pro with a new version of Readdle’s PDF Expert for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, which was pushed to the App Store this morning.
* In addition to swiping with your finger and sketching with Apple Pencil, the application now permits you to transfer PDF documents from your Mac to the iPad, or vice versa, with a single tap, courtesy of Readdle’s all-new Transfer technology.
* “We’ve seen many requests to add more Apple Pencil support, and we understand how inconvenient and sometimes not obvious it was to get your stylus to work,” said Readdle. “Well, that’s already in past, and some day you’re gonna long those good old days.”
* The app supports pressure sensitivity via Apple Pencil, too.
* As for the new Readdle Transfer technology, it’s a proprietary solution that doesn’t rely on Apple’s Handoff, which PDF Expert for iOS and OS X already support. In order for Readdle Transfer to work, devices running the app must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
