* Although the jailbreak community is still eagerly awaiting a public jailbreak for iOS 11.3.1 amid Ian Beer’s latest exploit releases, there have been some rather interesting jailbreak tweak releases that may hold you over in the meantime.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia this week. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites and then outline the rest of them afterward.

* BetterCCXI makes the iOS 11 Control Center interface more accessible by providing users with resizing options for two of the most popular modules: connectivity and music.
* The resizing options allow you to display more controls at a glance and space things out so you’re not always tapping the wrong things. As a bonus, Control Center’s look and feel are each vastly improved by the new aesthetic.
* You can learn more about BetterCCXI and why it’s a great addition to jailbroken iOS 11 devices in our full review.

* Anyone who misses how notifications used to look in iOS 9 will feel right at home with a new release called Nine.
* This tweak is designed to replace the iOS 11 notification aesthetic with one similar to that of iOS 9. It replaces the modular Lock screen and Notification Center notifications with a list of notifications, and it even impacts the banners you see throughout iOS.
* You can learn more about Nine and how it invokes iOS 9-related nostalgia in our full review.

* Depending on how much of a Pokémon fan you are, PokeCall is a new jailbreak tweak that might be worth checking out.
* This tweak replaces the incoming call interface with one that looks and feels like the classic handheld Pokémon games. As you might come to expect, the developer ported all the options to answer, decline, or respond to calls with a message instead.
* You can read more about PokeCall and how it transforms the incoming call interface in our full review.
