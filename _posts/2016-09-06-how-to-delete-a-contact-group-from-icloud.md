* Contact groups can be useful, but as your list of contacts changes over time, you may outgrow the need for some you already have, or develop a need to make more. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can delete a contact group from iCloud.com.
* Spring-cleaning your contact group list helps reduce clutter in the Contacts app and makes it easier to find the contacts you want right when you need them.
* Fortunately, it’s really easy to remove an unwanted contact group, all you really need to do is follow these steps:
* 1) Visit the iCloud.com website in your favorite web browser and log in.
