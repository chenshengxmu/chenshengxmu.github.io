* pod2g has handed over the keys to his iOS 5 untethered jailbreak for A4 devices (which includes the iPhone 4) to the Chronic Dev Team. In doing so, he hopes to focus primarily on the A5 jailbreak, which covers the iPhone 4S and iPad 2.
* Since the untethered jailbreak for pre-A5 chip devices is basically finished, this will allow pod2g to get the iPhone 4S jailbreak back up to speed. This is very good news for owners of both A4 and A5 devices, because that means that both are being heavily worked on simultaneously…
* Here is the latest from pod2g:
* I need to focus on A5 and hope I can find a path quick, and I have the feeling that chronic-dev could help me.
* In essence, pod2g plans to hand over the details of his A4 jailbreak to the Chronic Dev Team for packaging, bug fixes, and final deployment to the masses:
* I gave all the details to the chronic dev team so that they can finish, test, integrate and release the A4 jb ASAP.
* This will allow him to focus on the iPhone 4S, as he alludes to below:
* I’ll put all my energy from now on on the A5
* This is very good news for both iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 owners. With this refocused game plan, there is sure to be a wiser use of resources to get both completed as quickly as possible.
* Which one are you looking forward to most? An iPhone 4 (iOS 5.x) or an iPhone 4S untethered jailbreak?
