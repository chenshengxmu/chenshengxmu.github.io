* Apple on Friday posted three new commercials as part of its ongoing Shot on iPhone advertising campaign. In line with Apple’s focus on regional media campaigns, the videos celebrate Children’s Day in Turkey and are now available for streaming through the company’s Turkish channel on YouTube.
* Each clip runs fifteen seconds long and highlights iPhone’s Slo-Mo video capture capability and other photography features.
* All three videos have been captured by 11-year old children.
* Here are the ads.
* National Sovereignty and Children’s Day is one of the public holidays in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. It’s held on April 23 each year, when children take seats in the Turkish Parliament and symbolically govern the country for one day, even signing executive orders.
* How do you like Apple’s new advertisements?
