* With less than a week until the highly anticipated June 10 keynote at Apple’s summer conference for developers, first banners are now going up at Moscone Center in San Francisco. Judging by the looks of it, WWDC 2013 will focus on a major iOS redesign that Tim Cook officially confirmed last week during his D11 segment. As more of these photos surface in the next hours, we’ll be adding them to this post throughout the day…
* The top image, courtesy of Appleholic on Instagram, most likely depicts the new icons in iOS 7 which suggest a flat user interface revamp that Apple’s design guru Jony Ive has been working on.
* And here’s a really blurry shot via appleiphonetechuk on Twitter.

* The one above tells us the official WWDC 2013 tagline: “Where a whole new world is developing”.
* According to Apple’s boss, the teams amped up their innovation and collaboration.
* “We recognized that Jony had contributed significantly to the look and feel of Apple over many many years, and he could do that for our software as well,” he said.
* We’re not expecting new iPhones or iPads at the conference, though upgraded Mac notebooks remain a possibility with Intel’s official announcement of the fourth-generation Haswell processors earlier today.
* For what it’s worth, Apple’s media release confirms the firm will “get new versions of iOS and OS X” into the hands of its registered developers. Just yesterday, Apple released the official WWDC 2013 app that will stream sessions videos as soon as they go live.

* It also sports Passbook support, offers access to an archive of previous sessions and employs a curiously flattened appearance that gets rid of the gloss and shiny elements, probably foreshadowing the new iOS 7 look.
* For comparison’s sake, check out the 2011 vs. 2012 app design.

* Conveniently enough, the company just released OS X 10.8.4 before WWDC next week.
* The operating system update features Wi-Fi and Microsoft Exchange improvements, along with a host of obligatory fixes.
* By the way, if you happen to be around Moscone West, do us a favor and take a few photos of these banners and we’ll feature them here.
* So, who’s excited about iOS 7 and WWDC?
