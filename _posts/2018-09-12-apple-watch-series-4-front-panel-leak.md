* Apple’s prematurely published (but now pulled) sitemap brought us all sorts of goodies this morning, including a tidbit which strongly indicates that Apple Watch Series 4 will indeed come in new 40mm and 44mm sizes. And now, an alleged front panel for the unreleased wearable device has leaked out, all but confirming the new Series 4 hardware sizes.
* As seen on Slashleaks this morning, this leak comes from a source with an established track record. There’s not much to decipher from the image: it’s a transparent piece of plastic that allegedly represents the front panel belonging to the new Series 4 watches.
* There are no measurements provided. The image seems to support the main thesis that Apple Watch Series 4 would bring a 15 percent larger display than the previous models. Apple could enlarge the display by increasing the case size slightly whilst reducing the bezels.
* The current 38mm Apple Watch models are 33.3mm wide and the 42mm ones are 35.9mm wide. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier that the new Series 4 models would be about 39.9mm and 45.2mm wide in terms of case size. It’s this increase in case size, coupled with the skinnier bezels, that should result in an approximately fifteen percent larger display.

* The leaked Apple Watch Series 4 image depicts a busy watch face with nine simultaneous complications so this gives you an idea what the larger display sizes will accomplish.
* The watchOS 5 beta indicates that the 44mm Series 4 version might feature a resolution of 384-by-480 pixels—higher than the original iPhone and a significant increase over the 312-by-390 screens in the current 42mm models.
* The new Apple Watch Series 4 models are thought to sport other improvements, like a ceramic back and advanced electrocardiography (EKG) capabilities letting you take accurate readings of the electrical activity of your heart over a period of time.
* Apple has scheduled its “Gather round” event at 10 am PDT.
* iDownloadBlog will be providing remote live coverage before, during and after the event. To find out how to live stream the press conference, visit our special page created for this purpose.
