* After months of beta testing, Apple released iOS 5 to the masses on October 12th. The update was one of the biggest ever for Apple’s mobile operating system, bringing in over 200 new features. But unfortunately, they didn’t come without a price.
* Almost immediately after the new software was released, users began complaining of poor battery performance. Apple responded to the complaints with iOS 5.0.1, an update that was supposed to fix the highly-publicized battery bugs…
* Over the last few hours, however, iOS 5 battery complaints have continued to pour in, even from users that installed the latest update. It appears that not all of the battery bugs were worked out of iOS, and according to AllThingsD, Apple itself has just confirmed that.
* Here’s a statement from the company:
* “The recent iOS software update addressed many of the battery issues that some customers experienced on their iOS 5 devices. We continue to investigate a few remaining issues.”
* It looks like those who haven’t upgraded to iOS 5.0.1 should hold off until all of the battery issues are solved. If you plan on jailbreaking, you shouldn’t have updated in the first place. We’ll keep you updated on Apple’s progress.
