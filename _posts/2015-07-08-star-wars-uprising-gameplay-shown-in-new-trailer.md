* As Cody told you a month ago, there’s a new Star Wars mobile game in the works. It’s called Star Wars: Uprising and set between the events of Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi and the forthcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens film.
* Wednesday, publisher Kablam shared a new video giving us a good overview of Uprising’s mechanics and overall gameplay.
* Basically an action role-playing game, Uprising  should release in a few weeks as a free-to-play download.
* Star Wars: Uprising, a dungeon crawler-esque game with RPG elements, will connect the events of Return of the Jedi and the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens film. Specifically, the game is taking place after the death of the Emperor and Darth Vader between Episodes 6 and 7.
* Some of the locations in Uprising will include the Anoat Sector, Hoth and Cloud City.
* In the days following the Battle of Endor and the fall of the Emperor, The Anoat sector has been locked down by the Empire, developers explain.
* “With the Rebel Alliance on the other side of the Iron Blockade, it falls to the sector’s smugglers, freedom fighters, bounty hunters and gangsters to join forces and form an uprising,” reads the blurb.
* You’ll be able to create a Rebel character of your own and boost their stats, go on raid missions, enjoy single-player missions, battle the Empire in the real-time co-operative gameplay mode and more.
* Kalam has assembled a star team to work on Uprising, including staff veterans from EA’s Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Clone Wars series, with LucasFilm helping write the backstory.
* The release date of Star Wars: Uprising is set for September.
* Learn more about the game at the official website and pre-register to receive select in-game items ahead of Uprising’s worldwide release.
* I’m a Star Wars fan and also love free games so Uprising will be for me.
