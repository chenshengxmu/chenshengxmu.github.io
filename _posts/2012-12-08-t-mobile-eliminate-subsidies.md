* On Thursday, Deutsche Telekom announced that T-Mobile USA had entered into an agreement with Apple to bring products to market next year. CEO John Legere confirmed the news while speaking at a conference this week, saying that T-Mobile will indeed be carrying the iPhone in 2013, and it will be offering it in a “different” way…
* What does he mean by different? Well assumedly, it has something to do with the fact that T-Mobile also recently announced that it will be eliminating handset subsidies by the end of the year. That means that instead of paying $99 or $199, customers will likely be paying full price — so more like $600 — for the iPhone and other devices.
* GigaOM has more on Legere’s comments:
* “What was missing? A certain number of customers wouldn’t come to the store if we didn’t have the iPhone,” Legere said. “We worked very, very hard for a deal that made sense for us…
* …When this device rolls out I can only tell you it will be a dramatically different experience, and I can only tell you that of all the reports that have been written about what’s going to happen when it comes out, they’re all wrong.”
* Traditionally, carriers factor handset subsidies into their plans and other monthly fees. That’s why you sign a contract to get the lower price on a phone, and why there’s an early termination fee if you cancel — they have to make sure they make their money back on the device. T-Mobile, however, is moving to a completely different model.
* The carrier will shift entirely to its unsubsidized Value Plans, which offer customers far cheaper monthly rates for voice and, particularly, data plans. With its new Value program, T-Mobile is keeping the contract, but passing the money it saves from not subsidizing handsets onto its subscribers. It’s an interesting strategy, but will it work?
* It’s hard to tell at this point. But regardless, finally cementing an iPhone deal can’t hurt. T-Mobile will be the last of the four major carriers in the US to offer Apple’s popular handset — a device that it blamed for much of its recent loss of some half a million subscribers.
* What do you think, would you pay more for an iPhone up front if it meant cheaper monthly fees?
