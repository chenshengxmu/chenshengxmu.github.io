* As promised recently, Snapchat’s mobile application was refreshed on App Store this morning with an updated look and a brand new universal search feature. Snapchat 10.0 for iOS, a free download from App Store, puts a universal search bar at the top of the interface. Other aspects of Snapchat’s experience have been refined as well. The refreshed look was available to Android users for some time now as the company said it would reach iPhone users soon, and now it’s made good on that promise.
* With the new search bar, users can now find friends, groups, Discover publishers and Our Stories just by typing a few letters. In addition, tapping the search bar reveals an overlay with options to access friends’ messages or stories through Quick Chat suggestions. You can even connect with your group chats, flip through a list of new friends, add others or find friends in your contacts, all from the search bar.

* If you tap the Bitmoji icon to the left of the search bar, you’ll immediately land on your own profile which now includes your frequent contacts underneath the Best Friends heading.
* To see someone else’s profile, tap and hold their card.
* Submitting your own snaps to Snapchat’s Our Story feature is now easier than before: simply tick the box next to Our Story to let Snapchat know they can use your posts in any Our Story they see fit.
* Snapchat’s gesture-heavy interface can be quite intimidating to novice users. Even though today’s update has not changed much in terms of navigation and using swipes and gestures, it’s a welcome albeit long overdue change that could help widen Snapchat’s user base.
* Grab Snapchat for iOS for free from App Store.
