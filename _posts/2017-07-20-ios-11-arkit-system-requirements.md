* iOS 11 introduced ARKit, a new framework for developers designed to shorten development times in terms of building augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad.
* Because ARKit does most of the heavy lifting in terms of plane detection, super accurate tracking, lighting estimation and more, apps powered by it are unsupported on older devices.
* Will your iPhone or iPad support ARKit-driven augmented reality experiences?
* According to Apple’s official ARKit resources for developers, ARKit requires high-performance hardware—apps built on it run on the Apple A9 and A10 processors.
* The following devices use these processors:
* “These processors deliver breakthrough performance that enables fast scene understanding and lets you build detailed and compelling virtual content on top of real-world scenes,” notes the company.
* If you own one of the aforementioned supported devices, you can run ARKit-powered apps on your iPhone and iPad. If not, you’re out of luck unless you buy a supported iOS device.
* ARKit does its magic by analyzing the scene presented by the camera view.
* It also uses data from onboard sensors. Fusing live camera sensor data with CoreMotion data allows sophisticated algorithms to detect horizontal planes in a room like tables and floors.
* ARKit can also track and place objects on smaller feature points and estimate the total amount of light available in a scene to apply the correct amount of lighting to virtual objects.
