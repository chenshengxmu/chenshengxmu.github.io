* Kicking off the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week, Twitch and Gameloft have announced that they are teaming up to provide the first ever mobile streaming game experience. To start with, they two say they’ve integrated Twitch into Asphalt 8: Airborne.
* Once the feature goes live, gamers will be given the ability to stream their gameplay to a Twitch channel. Additionally, they’ll also be able to stream their voice and image using their iOS device’s microphone and front-facing camera, and monitor chat from their stream followers…
* “This first-ever mobile game integration with Twitch opens the door for gamers to broadcast and share game play experiences like never before,” said Gameloft’s Baudouin Corman in the company’s press release. “As one of our most popular games, Asphalt 8: Airborne made perfect sense to integrate the Twitch mobile SDK, and we can’t wait to see the excitement it brings to our users.”

* Gameloft will be demonstrating Asphalt 8’s new broadcasting capabilities this week with a 24-hour live stream event on its Twitch channel. The demo will feature a walk-through of all the streaming options, interviews with the development team, giveaways and a Q&A session.
* The new Twitch feature will be available in an upcoming update for Asphalt 8, which will also add new events, new cars, and a new UI section. It’s worth noting, however, that the video streaming functionality is only optimized for the iPhone 5s, the iPad Air and the Retina iPad mini.
* There’s no word yet on if Twitch and Gameloft have plans to bring live streaming to other mobile titles.
* You can download Gameloft’s Asphalt 8: Airborne, for both the iPhone and iPad, from the App Store for free.
