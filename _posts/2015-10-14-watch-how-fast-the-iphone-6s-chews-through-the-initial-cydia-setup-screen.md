* When you first launch Cydia after a successful jailbreak, you’re met with a message that says something like this: Preparing Filesystem. Cydia will exit when complete.
* That’s a very familiar screen to us jailbreakers, and it’s something that we’ve grown accustomed to waiting on for extended periods of time…unless you own an iPhone 6s, that is.
* Whereas older devices can take up to a couple of minutes to get through this part of the jailbreak journey, the iPhone 6s tears through it like a pack of ravenous wolves. Watch our video and see for yourself.
* We always knew that the iPhone 6s was a specs beast, but as jailbreakers, this really makes the speed difference hit home.
* What do you think about the speed of the iPhone 6s? Are you impressed?
