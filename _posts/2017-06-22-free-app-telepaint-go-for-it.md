* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Telepaint. For the next 7 days, you can snag the paint-themed puzzler for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $3.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* You’ll need to think through all the steps—and fast—if you want to help a friendly bucket splash his way through Telepaint’s obstacle-filled conundrums. By linking the right portals, you can pick up keys, unlock rooms, and send the bucket jogging in the right direction. But beware: the friendly bucket is always on the move—even when that means a long drop into a sharp spike pit. Telepaint is dripping with style: traversing each portal results in a delightful splatter of paint, and the picture waves and flickers like an old analog TV.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Telepaint is available in the App Store for free.
