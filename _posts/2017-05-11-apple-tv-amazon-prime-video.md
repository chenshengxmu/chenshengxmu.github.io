* Amazon Prime Video is finally coming to Apple TV, reports BuzzFeed. Citing sources familiar with the plans, the outlet says that Apple will make the announcement next month at their World Wide Developers Conference.
* The move signals that the two companies have reached an agreement to end their years-long feud, which not only kept Amazon’s video app off of Apple’s set-top box, but also removed the Apple TV from Amazon’s storefronts.
* BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowksi, who has an excellent track record reporting on Apple’s future plans, says that the app is expected to go live this summer. Also, as part of the deal, Amazon will resume Apple TV sales at some point.
* If true, this will be a significant win for Amazon Prime customers using Apple TV. Currently, there is no way to natively access Amazon Prime Video on tvOS. WWDC will take place in San Jose, California and begin on June 5.
