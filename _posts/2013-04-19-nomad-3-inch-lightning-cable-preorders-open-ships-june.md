* The three-inch Nomad Lightning cable made waves when it was announced back in November 2012. This handy little USB-to-Lighting accessory fits your key ring and comes to the rescue when you find yourself out and about with a dying iPhone and no charger in sight.
* Originally a Kickstarter project, creators Kegan & Roberto developed the Nomad according to Apple’s strict requirements in order to earn the sought-after Lightning accessory certification. The Nomad cable is available for pre-order now, priced at $24.99 a pop (no shipments expected until June)…
* The team bills the Nomad as a three-inch Apple certified lightning USB cable for your key ring with sync and charge capability.
* The Nomad cable is perfect for use at work, in the car, at home, or anywhere on the go – it’s there when you need it!
* The USB side plugs into a cap that has a key ring hole.
* I’ll just outright admit: given the state of today’s mobile battery technology, the Nomad indeed is a must-have accessory.
* The promo clip is quite nice, have a look.
* You can pre-order yours at their web store.
* To learn more about the product, point your browser to the official web site.
