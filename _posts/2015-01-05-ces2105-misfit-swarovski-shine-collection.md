* With its fashionable Watch, Apple has officially entered the jewelry business. As one might imagine, the development has now captured the attention of the wearable industry which appears to be racing to add some shine and glamour to their accessories.
* At the CES 2015 in Las Vegas, Misfit has announced a partnership with the crystal jewelry maker Swarovski to produce a range of fitness and sleep-monitoring sensors outfitted with a Swarovski crystal.
* The Swarovski Shine Collection, as it’s called, is basically a range of fully waterproof accessories which includes new wireless activity and sleep monitors and nine matching accessories for all Shine devices.
* Both the Swarovski Shine Activity Tracking Crystal and a violet Swarovski Shine activity and sleep monitor are adorned with a cut Swarovski crystal. The latter uses a patented “energy crystal” technology, which is a fancy marketing name for a solar power technology.

* By utilizing an energy harvesting technology, the violet Swarovski Shine can power itself and doesn’t require charging. “Simply expose the violet Swarovski Shine to light to keep it charged,” Misfit boasted.
* The clear version of the Swarovski Shine Activity Tracking Crystal uses a standard replaceable battery. Both editions of the Swarovski Shine activity tracker are waterproof and compatible with Misfit’s free iOS app for food and weight logging.

* Matching accessories include bracelets, wristbands and pendants.
* The clear version of the Shine comes in three sets, each with two matching accessories. The Swarovski Shine Collection is now available for pre-order in the United States through the Misfit online store.
* With most fitness trackers designed to blend in, the Swarovski Shine Collection will definitely make your Misfit wearable stand out.
