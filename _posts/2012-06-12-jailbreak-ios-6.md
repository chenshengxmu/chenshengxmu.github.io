* It’s true, MuscleNerd has successfully jailbroken iOS 6 on an iPod Touch 4th generation device. Unfortunately, that jailbreak isn’t publicly available, and in its current form it’s hardly what we’d expect anyway. While it’s been technically jailbroken by the defacto leader of the iPhone Dev Team, essential items like Cydia still lack functionality, and it’s just a tethered jailbreak.
* Hence, it’ll probably be a while before we see an official iOS 6 beta jailbreak from the Dev Team. It’s just nice to know that they’ve already started tinkering around with the possibilities…
* Here’s ioreg of my tethered-JB ipt4g 6.0: is.gd/1qOwvW ..MANY things including Cydia are broken, don’t expect beta JB for a while!

* What do you think? You can’t tell me you’re surprised that they did it this fast, can you?
