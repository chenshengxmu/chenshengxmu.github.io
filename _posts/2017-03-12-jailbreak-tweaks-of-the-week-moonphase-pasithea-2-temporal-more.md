* It’s been a nice breath of fresh air for the last few weeks as the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10 has helped keep the jailbreak community afloat. While the relentless releases of jailbreak tweaks have been a lot to keep up with, no one here at iDB has anything bad to say about that!
* In this roundup, we’ll go over all the jailbreak tweaks that are new in Cydia as of this week, starting with our favorites and then moving on to everything else afterwards.
* MoonPhase – $0.99

* MoonPhase is a cool new tweak that puts the current phase of the Moon in your Status Bar, just to the right of the clock.
* The tweak is very reminiscent of the feature that comes standard on the Apple Watch and lets you keep track of the full and new Moon cycle.

* Pasithea 2 (iOS 10) is one of the best ways to manage your iPhone’s pasteboard without having to go through the cumbersome copy and paste methods that you typically experience on a stock device.
* This tweak puts all of your pasteboard contents into a specialized dedicated keyboard that can be accessed from the globe key. Tapping on items from the keyboard inputs it into any text field your cursor is waiting in.
* The menu is fully manageable, letting you favorite and remove pasteboard history items. You can also customize how your menu works with a bevy of options.
* You can read our full review Pasithea 2 (iOS 10) to learn more about how it works and why it improves the workflow of chronic typists.
* Temporal – $1.15

* People who consistently deal with people in other time zones will love a new tweak called Temporal because it puts time zone information from your world clock selections right on the Lock screen.
* The tweak sources your wold clock selections from the stock Clocks app. By swiping left and right on your Lock screen clock, you pan through the various time zones you’ve saved.
* Each world clock shows details about the location and how the time differs from your own, so the next time you need to know what time it is in another state or country before you send a message to someone, you might find this tweak to be an invaluable tool.
* You can read our full review of Temporal to learn more about it and how purchasing it can help to fight neuroblastoma.
