title: Apple will actually replace the battery of your iPhone 6 and later regardless of its condition

* Last week, and following the iPhone performance throttling fiasco, Apple announced it would replace batteries of iPhone 6 and newer devices for a discounted $29. At the time, it was understood that to qualify for the battery replacement, your iPhone had to go through a battery diagnostic. That diagnostic would then dictate whether your battery was bad enough for Apple to replace it.
* According to iGen which obtained an internal note from Apple on Tuesday, all Apple customers that request a battery replacement will get one, regardless of of the results of the battery diagnosis run on the device.
* Prior to the policy change, a diagnostic would have to be run, and the battery had to hold 80% or less of its charge to be eligible for a replacement. Apple will now apparently replace any battery from qualifying devices without running that test.
* Of course, this only applies to the same class of devices as before, specifically, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE.
* With this move, Apple is obviously trying to do good by disgruntled users, a move that will likely play in the company’s favor in the dozen or so class action lawsuits that were brought forward last week.
* The battery replacement has already started, and if you have one of these older devices and want a new battery, you can get in touch with Apple today to initiate the process.
