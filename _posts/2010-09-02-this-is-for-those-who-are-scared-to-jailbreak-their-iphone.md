title: This is For Those Who Are Scared to Jailbreak Their iPhone

* After weeks of self debate and bugging Sebastien about the possibilities of jailbreaking my iPhone 4, I took the leap of faith Wednesday night and cracked opened my device. I must say that the whole process was unbelievably painless and took no more than 5 minutes to perform the hack and update the Cydia packages.
* I used JailbreakMe to perform the procedure and I will vouch for the website any day. After 2 or 3 minutes of loading, the device was jailbroken and ready to be used. Perhaps it was the Apple aroma in the air after their event, but nevertheless having jailbroken my iPhone 4 makes it feel like launch day all over again…
* The last device I jailbroke was my iPhone 3G over a year ago. You may ask, “Why now Ethan”? Since I never updated to 4.0.2 I figured that if something went horrifically wrong I could always just download the update and start from square one.
* Had I known how pain-free the experiment was going to go, I probably would have gone through with the ordeal a long time ago. I don’t know what the policy is for recommending others to go ahead and jailbreak their devices, but I will say that if you’re hearing horror stories of JailbreakMe I would seriously consider your source. It was literally as fast as backing up a device in iTunes.
* So there you have it, friends. I am now once again among the community of the open sourced brigade. Any of you who took a previous article of mine as condemning the process should be thoroughly confused.
* Now who’s got some suggestions as to where I should start my 3rd party downloading?
