* When Apple initially launched the iPhone 4S last week, the handset was only available in 7 countries. Apple typically does this with its major product rollouts to help guard against stock constraints and to minimize the impact of early issues that may arise.
* Well after a week of selling the iPhone 4S, it seems like Apple is confident that the product is ready for prime time. Next week, the company’s latest handset will go on sale in 22 more countries around the globe. And apparently, pre-orders have just begun…

* If you aren’t located in one of the 7 lucky countries that the iPhone 4S originally launched in, you may want to pay attention. MacStories is reporting that Apple has opened up a new preorder page on its website available to these 22 countries:
* Apple pre-sold over 1 million iPhone 4S’ last week, so it’ll be interesting to see how this round goes. The international shipping dates are still showing 1-2 weeks, so make sure to plan accordingly.
* Are you pre-ordering an iPhone 4S today?
