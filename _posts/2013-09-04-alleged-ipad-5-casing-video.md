* With Apple’s September 10 event now less than a week away, all of the tech world’s attention has turned to the next generation iPhones. It’s believed that we’ll see two of them next week: an updated iPhone 5S, and an all-new budget iPhone 5C.
* But let’s not forget that these aren’t the only new products in Apple’s pipeline. The company also has updated iPads in the wings, which are expected to be unveiled in October. And one of them, said to be the iPad 5, was just caught on tape…
* The video above comes from Lewis Hilsenteger of the YouTube channel Unbox Therapy (via AppleInsider), who believes he has a rear shell and digitizer belonging to the iPad 5. If the parts are legit, the clip offers a unique look at the upcoming tablet.
* The first thing you notice is the size difference between the next-gen iPad and its predecessor. As we’ve heard several times before, the new 9.7-inch tablet’s design looks very similar to that of the iPad mini, with smaller bezels and rounded edges.

* Now, don’t underestimate the significance of this redesign. The fact that the iPad 5 is thinner, lighter and has a smaller footprint will make a big difference to consumers who avoided previous generation models due to size and lack of portability.
* Unfortunately, outside of its form factor, we can’t gather much from the video. And we haven’t heard much regarding the tablet’s internals, but we assume it’ll run some variation of Apple’s new A7 processor, and feature a few other spec bumps.
* Again, we’re not expecting to see the redesigned iPad, or the second-gen iPad mini at Apple’s event next week. Instead, pundits are calling for a separate October event, like last year, where we’ll see new tablets, new Macs, and who knows what else.
