* About a month ago, we brought you Apple’s first official TV ad for their latest tablet. Although the new iPad certainly hasn’t needed any assistance from their marketing team, the commercial was really well done. It basically laid out the Cupertino company’s formula for making electronic products for the masses, which is focusing on the user experience and not so much on the technology behind it.
* It looks like Apple’s ad agencies have done it again. In their follow up 30 second spot for the iPad 2, Apple repeatedly completes the sentence, “If you asked…” The two most interesting lines come at the end of the commercial when the voiceover reads, “If you asked a child, she might call it magic. And if you asked us, we’d say it’s just getting started.”
* Although I’m not sure that there’s anyone in the world capable of imagining what Apple will come up with next, the last line of the advertisement certainly makes you think. The iPad is still very early in its life, imagine what it will look like in 5 years. Just look at the current iPod line and how much it has changed since Steve Jobs unveiled the original model back in 2001.
* What do you think the iPad will look like in 5 years?
