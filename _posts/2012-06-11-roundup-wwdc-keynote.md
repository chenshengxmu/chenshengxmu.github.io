* If you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed with the influx of Apple announcements that took over your Twitter stream today — don’t worry, iDB has you covered. Here’s a quick overview of what was introduced today…
* Sure, Apple showed off some cool features in their new desktop software. But for iDB, the star of the show today was iOS 6. This is the platform’s largest update since October of last year, and not only does it include a fresh coat of paint, but it also brings about several new features.
* These are just the few of the new iOS 6 features that made it into Apple’s announcements today. We’re expecting to see a lot more surface in the coming months.
* Despite early predictions that there would be a couple on hand, Apple unveiled a single new iOS application this morning. It’s showing up pre-installed in the iOS 6 beta, but it’s still unknown at this point if it will be available to non-iOS 6 devices via the App Store in the fall.
* Even though this announcement kind of flew under the radar today, we’re certainly keeping our eye on it. Apple has opened the app’s API up to businesses and developers, so it’s really be up to them how successful it is.
* Aside from software announcements, Apple also refreshed their entire MacBook lineup today. Both the Air and Pro models received considerable performance upgrades, but the show-stopper was definitely the all-new Retina display variant.
* The ‘Next-Generation MacBook Pro’ features a stunning 2880-by-1800 display, which equates to a staggering 220ppi (pixels per inch) or more than five million pixels. That’s 3 million more than an HDTV (iPad 3 has a million more than an HD TV).
* Is your head still swimming from all of the information? Perhaps you just need to watch the keynote for yourself. Otherwise, if you’re ready, we tons more iOS 6 coverage up including hands-on photos and video demonstrations.
* iOS 6 beta 1 is currently only available to developers. But Apple says that we can expect a public release this fall.
* Thanks for hanging with us all day. We hope you had as much fun as we did!
