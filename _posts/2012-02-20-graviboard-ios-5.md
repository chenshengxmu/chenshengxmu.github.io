* Graviboard is one of the most famous jailbreak tweaks of all time, so I was shocked that we had never covered it on video before.
* Today, the legendary tweak was updated with iOS 5 support. What better way to celebrate than to give it a thorough video walkthrough?
* Graviboard works flawlessly on iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads. If you’ve yet to check it out, be sure to have a look at our prior coverage of Graviboard.
* For existing users of Graviboard, version 2 is a free update. All other users can head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo to purchase it for $2.99.
* Are you a longtime Graviboard user? Let us know your thoughts about the latest update in the comments section.
