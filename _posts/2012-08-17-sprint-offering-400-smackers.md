* Sprint must really, really want you to become a subscriber, because on the heels of its $50 iPhone discount and $100 American Express Reward card offer, another promotion has been spotted.
* According to a new report, the country’s #3 carrier will soon start offering $400 of in-store credit to new customers if they switch their service over to Sprint and sign a two-year contract…
* PhoneArena has the scoop:
* “For activating three or more lines on an Everything Data Share or Simply Everything Data plan, Sprint will give you $400 of in-store credit that can be used towards the purchase of “qualifying devices”, such as new phones. Your signature under a 2-year contract is required too, and the lines must be active for at least 60 days.”
* New customers must be porting their lines over from a non-Sprint affiliated carrier (which means Boost and Virgin Mobile customers are out) to qualify for the offer, and the credit must be used in full at the time of purchase.
* The offer begins this weekend, on August 19th, and will run through September 15th. So if you’re looking to jump on Sprint’s unlimited data plans, or score some new iPhones next month, this might be worth looking into.
* What do you think, would you switch to Sprint for $400?
