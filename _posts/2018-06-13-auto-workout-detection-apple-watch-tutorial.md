* Your Apple Watch can remind you to start the correct workout or end the session, if you forget.
* The wearable device utilizes the built-in accelerometer and heart rate sensors to identify motion and increased heart rate, both tell-tale signs that you might be working out.
* It’s especially cool that auto-workout detection supports retroactive tracking to the beginning of your activity, letting you get credited for the exercises you’ve already finished should you get distracted when cooling down and forget to end your session manually.
* Auto-workout detection supports any Apple Watch model with watchOS 5 or newer.
* You can elect to receive a notification on your wrist reminding you to start the correct workout or get nudged to end your current workout session. The Apple Watch software supports this handy feature for the most popular workout types, like running, cycling and swimming.
* You can toggle on/off your start/end workout reminders individually.

* Start reminders are supported for the following workout types:
* End reminders apply to all workout types except “Other”.
* Are you a forgetful person? If so, auto-workout detection will ensure your progress is tracked if you’ve started training but forgotten to manually initiate a session in the Workout app.
* Fitness buffs and normals alike who depend on their Apple Watch to track workouts on a regular basis probably won’t have much use for these handy alerts.

* But if you don’t need to be reminded to start or end your workout sessions, disabling this Apple Watch feature should help prolong battery life a little bit.
* Here’s how to disable auto-workout detection.
* Auto-workout detection is on by default.
* To disable auto-workout detection for your Apple Watch, use either the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone or the Settings app on the watch itself.
* To disable auto-workout reminders from your wrist, do the following.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your watch.
* 2) Tap General in the list.
* 3) Tap Workout.
* 4) Toggle off the buttons labeled Start Workout Reminder and End Workout Reminder.

* Going forward, your Apple Watch will no longer alert you to start the correct workout based on detected motion and increased heart rate. Likewise, you will no longer be pinged to end the workout session following a period of inactivity.
* Do the following on your paired iPhone:
* 1) Open the companion Watch app on your iPhone with iOS 12 or later.
* 2) Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom.
* 3) Tap Workout.
* 4) Toggle off the buttons Start Workout Reminder and End Workout Reminder.

* You can also turn off your start reminder whilst leaving the other option on. Doing so will stop those start reminders while ensuring you’ll still get alerted if you forget to end the session.
