* The Pangu Team has released an update  to their iOS 8 jailbreak tool which was released out of the blue earlier today. Although no clear changelog is available, Pangu v1.0.1 brings a few bug fixes, including one that might have caused users who successfully jailbroke their device with the initial version to lose their photos.
* Although promising, Pangu v1.0.1 is still more of a tool for developers rather than end users. As we noted earlier today, the current version of Pangu doesn’t install Cydia, which hasn’t been updated to bring compatibility for iOS 8. It simply allows developers to test out their tweaks and update them for iOS 8.
* Saurik is currently working on an update for Cydia, with no ETA available at this time.
* Pangu v1.0.1 is still in Chinese and compatible with Windows only. Although it is safe to assume an English and Mac version of the tool will be available at some point, there is currently no time estimate for such releases.
* We reiterate what we said this morning regarding the usability of Pangu. At this time, we do not recommend casual users install Pangu on their device, mostly because there is no point so far. Once Cydia has been updated and packaged with an updated version of Pangu, we will of course recommend to go ahead with the jailbreak.
* In the release notes of their tool, Pangu Team said this morning that it is recommended to update or restore to iOS 8.1 via iTunes, as the tool could cause issues for devices that were updated over the air.
