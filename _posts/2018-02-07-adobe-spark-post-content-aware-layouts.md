* Adobe’s free Spark Post app lets you make eye-catching graphics and photo collages on your iPhone and iPad, and now it’s even better as the software just received a few new features.
* Content-aware layouts are now available when creating a collage in the app.
* Using machine learning, Spark Post will now generate and recommend layouts on the fly that better fit your selected photos. As an example, if you have one tall and two wide images, the app will suggest layouts with one tall vertical cell and two wide horizontal cells.
* Spark Post is all about create stunning graphics for all occasions that can be shared quickly on social media. The most recent update has brought out support for Instagram’s portrait and landscape sizes, as well as Spark’s own Video Slide sizes.

* When creating border and cell sliders for collages in the Layout tab, tap a new locking button to match and lock your current border and cell values, making it easier to adjust them together.
* Text resizing behavior has been improved as well to prevent unintentional line breaks when resizing a text box. A new list of curated color-pair swatches now appears when you’re applying colors to text boxes with backing shapes.
* Of course, you can easily customize these color swatches to your liking.
* Grab Adobe Spark Post for free from App Store.
