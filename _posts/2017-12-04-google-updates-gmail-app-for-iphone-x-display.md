* Another major app has been updated to support the big beautiful display on the iPhone X. Google has updated the official Gmail app (as well as the Google Opinion Rewards app) to support the larger screen.
* Like any app that hasn’t been updated, the previous version was letter-boxed with black bars on the top and bottom.
* Another major change in the update is the ability to add non-Google email accounts to the app.
* • You can now add non-Google email accounts to the Gmail app via IMAP.
* Gmail is available for free on the App Store for those who have yet to download it.
