* It is no secret that T-Mobile CEO John Legere is not one to mince words or back down from competition. Thus far, he’s delivered. The Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier, the fourth largest in the United States, has taken aim at rivals once again by unleashing the latest three-phase initiative that solves another customer pain point.
* The new Uncarrier moves started yesterday with the announcement of a new Simple Starter Plan that includes unlimited talk and text with 500MB of 4G LTE data with no overage fees, for just $40 per month.
* Thursday, T-Mobile made another huge announcement. For a limited time only, the carrier is offering 4G LTE tablets at Wi-Fi-only prices, with its interest-free financing that requires no downpayment and spreads the retail price of the device across 24 monthly installments.
* Knowing Apple’s cellular-capable iPads cost $130 more versus their comparable Wi-Fi-only models, that’s a not-to-be-missed $130 savings right off the bat. Also, if you add a tablet to your voice plan, T-Mobile will treat you to up to sixteen gigabytes of free high-speed 4G LTE data through the end of the year…
* Starting April 12, you’ll pay the Wi-Fi price of $499 for the 4G LTE-enabled iPad Air instead of Apple’s asking price of $630.
* Who says you can only surf inside a 50-foot “Wi-Fi zone” in some coffee shop? Your tablet should work where you are, like in the car or at a park. Weren’t tablets meant to set us free? We think so.
* And if you already own a Wi-Fi-only tablet, T-Mobile will take it and give you a credit that can be redeemed towards a brand new 4G LTE iPad. If your hardware is under contract with another carrier, T-Mobile will pay your and your whole family’s early termination fee to jump ship. 
* You’ll be paying for your hardware in 24 monthly payments, with zero down. Of course, the remaining balance on tablet becomes due should you cancel your wireless service with T-Mobile.
* The company says tablets from non-Apple vendors are eligible for this promotion, too, as long as customers activate a postpaid plan with 1GB of monthly data or more.
* The outspoken CEO was quoted in a media release:
* With this announcement, T-Mobile’s launching a full-on assault against the restrictions and pain points that keep tablet owners from experiencing life beyond the Wi-Fi zone.
* The Un-carrier is all about solving pain points, and today we’re eliminating every reason to be stuck on an unconnected Wi-Fi-only tablet. There’s no longer any need to limit the use of your tablet because you’re intimidated by Big Blue, Bad Red or Bumbling Yellow.
* T-Mobile has also been treating tablet buyers to 200MB of free cellular data each month (for as long as you own your tablet) ever since landing the iPad last October.
* Being stuck on Wi-Fi is stupid. Being with another carrier is stupid. Adding a 4G #LTE tablet to your @TMobile voice plan is smart! Be smart

* And starting April 12, voice customers who add a tablet to their plan will get up to sixteen gigabytes of free 4G LTE data through the end of 2014.
* Combined with the aforementioned free 200MB of data each month, that’s nearly 1.2GB of 4G LTE data, free of charge, every month through the end of 2014, no strings attached.
* As a bonus, existing voice customers can get T-Mobile’s 1GB plan free after a $10 credit.
* “If you love living beyond the Wi-Fi zone – and want to keep enjoying that tablet freedom beyond 2014 – you can get it starting at just $10 a month with voice service next year,” said the carrier.
* Cue competitions’ answer to #OperationTabletFreedom! Wait, nearly 1.2 GB of free 4G LTE data every month?! They can’t match it! #NotHappenin

* Again, T-Mobile is treating you to an additional 1GB of free tablet data for the rest of the year (on top of 200MB of free data), is selling 4G LTE tablets for the same model’s Wi-Fi price for a limited time, lets you trade in your Wi-Fi tablet to buy a new one for nothing down and will pay your ETF with device trade in.
* To learn more about the offer, check out T-Mobile’s Operation Tablet Freedom page and Jonh Legere’s blog post.
* T-Mobile’s third Uncarrier announcement is due tomorrow.
