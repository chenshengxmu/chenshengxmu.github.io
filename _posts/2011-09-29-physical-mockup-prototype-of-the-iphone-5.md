* At this point, there are few things we know for sure about the iPhone 5. But what we can assume from the recent rumors and leaked info is that the device might very well be thinner, and sport a larger screen.
* Confident that those rumored specs were likely to make it to the iPhone 5, MacRumors made some very convincing renderings of the future device awhile back. Today, German site Giga.de pushes it farther, with a physical mockup prototype of the iPhone 5…

* “Based on CAD designs, hardware components, several leaked hints, cases and recent, believable mockups we created a three-dimensional computer model. This virtual model was then used to build a very detailed, true prototype that you can hold in your own two hands.
* The process to create this prototype is the same that’s used to create the iPad. The back was machined from a sold block of aluminium, which was later treated with glass pearls to get the same slightly rough touch that we already know from the iPad.”
* We don’t know what the iPhone 5 will look like for sure until next Tuesday, but this prototype sure looks good.
