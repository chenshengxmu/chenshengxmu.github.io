* Like Griffin, Belkin and other iOS accessory powerhouses, Incipio turned up at CES this week to unveil a wide range of new products. Among them are a dual iPhone 5 car charger, and an iPhone case with a built-in tape measure.
* Perhaps most interesting, though, is its new Cashwrap iPhone case. The thin case not only protects the handset from drops and other accidents, but it also gives it the ability to make NFC transactions using the Isis platform…
* 9to5Mac has more details from Incipio’s official press release:
* “Less is more with the CASHWRAP™ Mobile Wallet Case, which allows users to forgo the traditional wallet and use the technology of the ISIS Mobile Wallet™ App to pay compliant merchants via NFC. Precision engineered with a co-molded Plextonium™ frame, the case provides sleek, low-profile protection for your iPhone 4/4S. The Isis Mobile Wallet™ App stores the consumer’s personal credit, debit and loyalty card information and organizes offers and coupons, making payment quick and simple.”
* For those unfamiliar with it, Isis is a new(ish) mobile payment service based on near field communications technology. It’s backed by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, and is currently only available in a handful of areas in the US.
* But if you live near an Isis area and carry an iPhone, this seems like a no-brainer. The case will be launching this spring with a price tag between $59 and $69, and unfortunately will only initially be available for the iPhone 4 and 4S.
