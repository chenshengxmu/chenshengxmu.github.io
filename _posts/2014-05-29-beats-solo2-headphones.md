* Less than 24 hours into Apple’s announcement that it is buying Beats for $3 billion, Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre’s startup has announced a refreshed version of its best-selling headphones model, the Solo². Of course, this has nothing to do with Apple as the accessory has been in the making for months.
* The new on-ear headphones offer a more dynamic, wider range of sound and a clarity that will “bring you closer to what the artist intended”. The design has been revised for a better custom-fit feeling…
* Beats explains:
* The earcups have been ergonomically angled to complete this natural fit, with pivots for optimal comfort and sound delivery. Finally, the earcups’ premium material helps dissipate heat and minimize sound leakage.
* The design is unmistakably Dr. Dre.

* Check out the official promo video.
* The soundtrack is Ed Sheeran’s upcoming track, titled ‘Don’t’.
* Yup, that’s him featured in the ad.

* Engadget spent some hands-on time with the product and noted that the headphones sound way better than that feel.
* Beats headphones are usually criticized for their heavy bass sound so the company has toned down the bass slightly to cater to a more mainstream audience.
* Here’s an excerpt from Engadget’s review:
* Well, the best way I can describe the sound here is “more balanced.” Don’t get me wrong: There’s still plenty of bass when tunes call for it, but you can also clearly pick up other elements — things like hi-hats, snares and others all seem to stand out more when compared to previous releases.
* The Wall Street Journal praised the improved design that fits more comfortably on your head, higher quality materials and improved acoustics.
* “The ear cups now sit at an angle that’s far more comfortable on your ears—especially after hours of wear,” noted WSJ. “The new ear-cup design also blocks out more background noise.”
* You can preorder the $199.95 Solo² over at the Beats store.
