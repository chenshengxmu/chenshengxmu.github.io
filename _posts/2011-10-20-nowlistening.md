* NowListening is a jailbreak tweak for iOS 5 that makes it so you can receive banner notifications whenever your iPod app begins playing a new song.
* Unfortunately, there is no default option to enable this function on a stock iOS 5 installation, so you must have a jailbroken iPhone to enable music banner notifications.
* If you meet this criteria, then take a look inside for a video walkthrough of NowListening…
* If there’s one negative thing to say about NowListening, it’s that it doesn’t support more than just the plain old iPod app. If this were able to work with Pandora, Spotify, Rdio, and others, it would be truly great.
* Even still, with iTunes Match on the horizon, NowListening is a great way to be grab a quick glimpse of what song just began playing.
* You can pick it up for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. What do you think?
