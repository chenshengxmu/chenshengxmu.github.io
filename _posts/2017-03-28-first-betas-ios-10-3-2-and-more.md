* Apple on Tuesday seeded the first betas of iOS 10.3.2, tvOS 10.2.1, watchOS 3.2.2 and macOS 10.12.5 to developers. Registered developers can update to the new betas via each platform’s respective OTA mechanism, or via the developer portal.
* Todays releases come just 24 hours after Apple launched public versions of iOS 10.3 with Find My AirPods and new Apple File System, tvOS 10.2 with faster scrolling, watchOS 3.2 with Theater Mode and macOS Sierra 10.2.4 with Night Shift.
* We don’t know yet what new features have been added in today’s betas. Apple’s release notes do say that SiriKit has been fixed in iOS 10.3.2, and SiriKit car commands should now work as expected. We’ll let you know if we discover anything else.
