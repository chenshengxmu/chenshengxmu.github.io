* This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that there will be a larger screen on the iPhone 5. Some recent iPhone 5 renderings also point to an edge-to-edge screen.
* An edge-to-edge glass screen could help reduce the device’s thickness and weight. A larger screen could also easily allow for the more advanced multitouch gestures found in iOS 4.3.
