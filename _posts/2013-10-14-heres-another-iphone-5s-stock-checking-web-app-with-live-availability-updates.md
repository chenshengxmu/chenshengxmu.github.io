* Jeff recently told you about a nice little web app which lets you quickly check iPhone 5s stock and now word comes of another stock-tracking software. Found at www.stock5s.com, this one monitors the handset’s availability from online vendors across the world, including the online Apple Store and a number of carrier stores. It’s updated live and offers an insight into what iPhone 5s models people in specific markets are searching for the most…
* The screenshot top of post represents availability of the off-contract iPhone 5S models on the online Apple Store in the United Kingdom. Users can also check the handset’s availability across the online web shops of UK’s O2 and Three carriers.
* The same goes for any other supported market
* I also love how the web app converts local prices prices to US dollars, based on the 16GB entry-level model. For example, users in Germany pay an equivalent of $948 for the unlocked 16GB iPhone 5s versus $649 in the United States.
* Live updates with e-mail alerts are available on a per-country basis for a handful of supported markets like the United States, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong and Singapore, with more to be added in due time.
* The gold iPhone 5s is nowhere to be seen over at AT&T.

* For U.S. users, the web app offers availability and pricing information from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Apple. At the time of this writing, the entry-level 16GB iPhone 5s was unavailable across the three carriers, with higher-capacity 16/32GB white and space grey models in-stock at AT&T.
* The gold model is by far the most searched-for handset with in-store pickup. As for capacity, more than half of the searches were for the entry-level 16GB model, followed by 32 and 64GB variants – again, assuming the in-store pickup option.
* This past weekend, the online Apple Store was updated with a new shipping estimate of 2-3 weeks for online iPhone 5s orders. Both new iPhones are slated to hit an additional 50+ new markets by November 1, according to the company.
