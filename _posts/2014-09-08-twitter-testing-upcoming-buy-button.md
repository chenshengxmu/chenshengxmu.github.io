* Twitter, the popular micro-blogging service, on Monday said it started testing a new Buy button with a small percentage of its users in the United States.
* The company said the feature, which allows users to buy products directly from the tweet, is part of a broader effort to make shopping from mobile devices “convenient and easy, hopefully even fun”.
* Launch partners include Fancy, Gumroad, Musictoday, Stripe and many more. Users will get access to offers and merchandise “they can’t get anywhere else,” with the ability to buy stuff directly in Twitter’s mobile apps for iOS and Android.
* Twitter does not share your credit card with the seller without your permission, as detailed in a FAQ related to Twitter’s security and privacy policies.
* In addition to retail partners, Twitter is also teaming up with artists, brands and nonprofits on this initiative, including Beartooth, Brad Paisley, Burberry, Dan+Shay, Death From Above 1979, Demi Lovato, DonorsChoose, Eminem, GLAAD, GLIDE, Global Citizen, The Home Depot, Hunter Hayes, Kiesza, Keith Urban, The Nature Conservancy, Megadeth, Mike Stud, Panic! At The Disco, Pharrell, Paramore, (RED), Ryan Adams, Soundgarden, The New Pornographers, twenty one pilots, Wiz Khalifa and 9/11 Day.
* Yes, Megadeath!
* Twitter argues that a purchase can be completed in just a few taps.
* Here’s a promotional video.
* “After tapping the Buy button, you will get additional product details and be prompted to enter your shipping and payment information,” notes the firm. “Once that’s entered and confirmed, your order information is sent to the merchant for delivery.”
* The new options in Twitter.com settings menu for buying on Twitter can be seen below.

* Twitter’s iOS and Mac apps are available free in the App Store and Mac App Store.
* What do you think about buying products directly from the tweet?
