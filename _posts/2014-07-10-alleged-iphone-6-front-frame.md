* Continuing on with the barrage of iPhone 6 part leaks we’ve seen over the past few weeks, Apple.club.tw today shares a new photo of what is believed to be the front LCD frame of the handset. It looks to be complete with metal shielding, and Home button bracket.
* In a complete iPhone, this component would sit in between the front panel and the rear shell, both of which we’ve seen in other leaks.   It also contains the all-important LCD panel, and helps sandwich in the battery, logic board, and various other internal pieces…
* Apple.Club claims that the part belongs to the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 6. It’s impossible to confirm its legitimacy, but using the hand in the above photo as a reference, it certainly looks larger than the current iPhone. It also appears to match up with previous leaks.

* A 5.5-inch version of the iPhone 6 is also expected this year, but physical evidence for that model has been far more scarce. This could be explained, though, by reports claiming that mass production on the larger device is expected to begin after the 4.7-inch model.
* In addition to larger displays, the iPhone 6 is expected to feature an A8 processor, enhanced camera and other improvements. The consensus is that Apple is planning a media event to unveil the new handsets in mid-September, with a launch following shortly after.
