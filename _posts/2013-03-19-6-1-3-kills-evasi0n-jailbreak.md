* It was fun while it lasted, but it appears that Apple has finally put an end to evasi0n. Earlier today, the company released iOS 6.1.3 to the masses, and as expected, it contains patches for multiple exploits used in the popular iOS 6.x jailbreak.
* MuscleNerd confirmed our fears on Twitter just a few moments ago, pointing out that Apple has credited the evad3rs with the discovery of 4 of the 6 security flaws that were patched in today’s update. So jailbreakers should stay far away…
* Here’s one of the exploits mentioned in the security briefing:
* Kernel Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later Impact: A local user may be able to determine the address of structures in the kernel Description: An information disclosure issue existed in the ARM prefetch abort handler. This issue was addressed by panicking if the prefetch abort handler is not being called from an abort context. CVE-ID CVE-2013-0978 : evad3rs
* Remember, as planetbeing explained in an interview last month, the evasi0n jailbreak relies on a number of exploits. So it’s not clear what this means exactly for the jailbreak community in the near future. But we’re guessing it’s not good news.
* As for the distant future, though, the evad3rs have said that they still have several ‘major’ exploits in reserve, outside of what evasi0n used, so rest assured that we will see another jailbreak come around again. We’re just not sure when.
* The evasi0n jailbreak tool was created by the evad3rs team—made up of MuscleNerd, pod2g, planetbeing, and pimskeks. It landed on February 4 of this year, and withstood two iOS software updates.
* To ensure you keep your current jailbreak intact, you’ll want to stay away from today’s update (iOS 6.1.3), and follow these 3 steps outlined in our ‘How to protect your jailbreak’ guide. Save your SHSH blobs, use Safe mode, and stay tuned to iDB.
