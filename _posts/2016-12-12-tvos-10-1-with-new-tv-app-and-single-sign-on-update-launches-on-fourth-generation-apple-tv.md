* Alongside releasing the feature-packed iOS 10.2 software update for iPhone and iPad and watchOS 3.1.1 for Apple Watch owners, Apple also this morning launched tvOS 10.1, the first major update to the operating system powering the fourth-generation Apple TV following tvOS 10.0’s debut in September.
* tvOS 10.1 (build number 14U593) is not as feature-packed as iOS 10.2. It contains bug fixes, performance improvements, Apple’s new channel-guide app and support for the new Single Sign-On feature, among other items.
* Apple also today released Apple TV software 8.4.2 for the third-generation Apple TV.
* To update your Apple TV to tvOS 10.1, go to Settings → System → Software Updates → Update Software, then choose Download and Install or Update Later.
