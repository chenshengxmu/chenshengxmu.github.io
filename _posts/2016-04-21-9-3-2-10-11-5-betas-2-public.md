* Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS and OS X updates to public testers. Folks in the Beta Software Program can now install iOS 9.3.2 via OTA on their iOS devices, and OS X 10.11.5 via the App Store Software Update mechanism.
* These are the same betas that Apple pushed out to developers yesterday, along with updates for watchOS and tvOS. They arrive about a month after the public releases of iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4, which brought about several user-facing changes.
* iOS 9.3.2 and 10.11.5, however, are expected to be more tame updates, with a focus on under-the-hood improvements. Somewhat noteworthy, the second 9.3.2 developer beta brings back the ability to use Night Shift and Low Power mode simultaneously.
* Weâ€™ll update this post if any new changes are found.
