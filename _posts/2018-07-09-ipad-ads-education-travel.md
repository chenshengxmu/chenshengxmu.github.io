* Apple on Monday released four new videos through its official YouTube channels in local markets, highlighting the education and travel-focused features of the iPad tablet series.
* The four new ads are available in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and the United Kingdom, suggesting they’re tailored to the local markets. The videos are based on the latest sixth-generation “education” iPad that released in March in the US, priced at $329.
* “With iPad, you can be more flexible, making travel a little less painful.”
* “With iPad, you can keep your typed or handwritten notes neat and organized, even if you’re not.”
* “With iPad, you can pack a bag with all your stuff, minus the stuff.”
* “With iPad you can mark up and edit all your paperwork, without the paper.”
* The new commercials arrive less than 24 hours after the Cupertino firm, via its official US YouTube channel, put out a polished, humorous 100-second iPhone X ad based on an imaginary game show that showcases unlocking saved passwords with Face ID.
* Which of these new short videos is your favorite, and why?
