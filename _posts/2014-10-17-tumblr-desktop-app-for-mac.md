* Tumblr today released a new desktop application for OS X Yosemite in the Mac App Store. Complementing the micro-blogging site’s iOS client, the new app allows users to browse Tumblr, post to their own blogs, and perform various other actions.
* The UI is very minimalistic, and goes great with the new design language in Yosemite. The app also takes advantage of a few OS X features such as Full Screen mode, and the Share button—you can post to Tumblr from almost anywhere on your Mac.

* Other than that, there’s not much to the application. Sure, full-screen browsing is nice, as is the ability to quickly post things like images, videos and web links. But beyond those two things, it’s essentially a repackaged version of the Tumblr web app.
* That won’t be enough to draw in casual users, however, folks who frequent the website will likely benefit from the added capabilities. If you’re interested, you can grab the new Tumblr app from the Mac App Store (requires OS X Yosemite) for free.
