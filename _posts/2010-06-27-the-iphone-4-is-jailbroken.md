title: The iPhone 4 is Jailbroken
---
* Ladies and gentlemen, there is a jailbreak for iPhone 4. iPhone hackers PlanetBeing and Chpwn have managed to get root access (jailbreak) the iPhone 4, by using a variation of the Spirit jailbreak by Comex.
* A few hours ago, PlanetBeing posted the following on Twitter:
* Think I’m the first one I know about to get a root shell (and SSH) on iPhone 4, using poor @comex’s code (since he has no iPhone 4)
* This was later confirmed by MuscleNerd who posted a tweet containing this retina display image of Cydia on an iPhone 4.

* And now for the bad news… iPhone hacker p0sixninja confirmed on Twitter that this version of Spirit used to jailbreak the iPhone 4 cannot be released at the time being because it contains parts of Apple’s proprietary code, which is obviously illegal.
* This bad news was also confirmed by PlanetBeing which insisted on the fact that Spirit is nowhere ready for a release. What does that mean? Well, it means it might take a few more days, maybe weeks, until Spirit can officially be released to jailbreak the iPhone 4.
