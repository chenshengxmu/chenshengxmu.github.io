* No matter if you’re designing a newsletter in Pages, putting together a mockup of your blog in Pixelmator, editing a video project in Final Cut Pro X, creating a 3D scene and so forth, at some point you’ll want to move things around with pixel precision.
* Thankfully, macOS provides a very useful Accessibility feature that allows you to move the mouse pointer in all directions and replicate clicks using just the keyboard.
* In this quick tutorial, we’ll show you how to turn on a life-saving Mouse Keys feature and take advantage of it to move the mouse pointer and press the mouse button with your Mac’s keyboard or numeric keypad.
* 1) Bring up the Accessibility Options overlay by pressing the Option + Command + F5 key combo. Older macOS editions may require you to visit Accessibility settings in System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse & Trackpad.

* Tip: If you own a Touch Bar-outfitted Mac, triple-press the Touch ID button to pull up Accessibility Options.
* 2) In the Accessibility Options overlay, tick the box next to Enable Mouse Keys located underneath the Mouse & Trackpad heading to turn Mouse Keys on.

* 3) Click Done to close the overlay and save the changes.
* 4) There are additional options for adjusting how this feature behaves that you can change to your liking in System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse & Trackpad. First select Mouse & Trackpad in the lefthand column, then click Options next to the Enable Mouse Keys checkbox.

* 5) Click OK to exit this screen, then close out System Preferences.
* When Mouse Keys is on, you cannot use the keyboard or numeric keypad to type letters, numbers or symbols as your keyboard now controls the mouse pointer. To bring back regular typing, turn Mouse Keys off.

* With Mouse Keys enabled, you can control the mouse pointer using your Mac’s keyboard.
* Most people will use this convenient feature on an ad-hoc basis—for example, in situations when they’re working on a project which requires moving the pointer with pixel accuracy.
* Aside from moving the pointer left, right, up, down and in all directions diagonally, the keys on your Mac’s keyboard also simulate actions like clicking, releasing or holding the mouse button.

* And that’s all when it comes to using the Mouse Keys feature.
* I find Mouse Keys a convenient way of moving the pointer whenever high precision is required. I normally use this feature in conjunction with image editors like Pixelmator and Adobe Photoshop when standard alignment guides become a nuisance but I’m sure you’ll find your own uses for Mouse Keys.

* If you like this handy macOS capability, I recommend enabling the option to turn Mouse Keys on and off by pressing the Option key five times in a rapid succession (you’ll hear an audible confirmation when the feature is toggled).

* Were you aware that this feature existed? And will you be using it, do you think?
