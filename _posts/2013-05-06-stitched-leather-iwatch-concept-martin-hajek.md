* I’m a big fan of 3D artist Martin Hajek and his work. In case you’re unfamiliar with Hajek, he’s the brains behind the often gorgeous renderings of rumored Apple products and is renowned for his 3D modeling skills, as evident in his exquisite renderings. Back in March, Hajek created a more traditional concept of the rumored iWatch for the MacUser magazine.
* He’s back at it again, having created a fresh batch of alleged Apple smartphone mockups for the April 2013 issue of the magazine…
* Here are a few more renderings.

* If you’re a 3D artist yourself, download the highly detailed 3D model over at Turbosquid.
* Also check out Hajek’s blog for a few additional renderings not included here.
* Here’s a thing: I’m not a huge fan of that stitched leather band – you could say I detest it. Moreover, I’m having a really hard time imagining Apple throwing its proverbial brand behind such an old-school design.
* But if the iWatch project in fact exists, two cents say Apple will offer its own straps and leave third parties to fill in the blanks.

* As the likes of Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and LG get allegedly busy developing their smartwatch products, traditional makers are turning to outlandish designs because accuracy and workmanship are no longer enough to keep customers happy, per The Wall Street Journal.
* I personally can’t recall the last time I slapped a watch on my wrist. For the past six years, my iPhone has been on my person at all times so time readings have always been a glance away.
* The only reason mechanical watches exist is “because they are works of art,” MB&F founder Maximilian Büsser tells the Journal and I couldn’t agree more.

* Who knows what happens when the next-generation of smart watches arrive.
* While I don’t think the traditional time piece will cease to exist, its wrist watch variant could easily get relegated to a niche market of filthy rich collectors and Wall Street investors who are happy to pay tens of thousands of dollars for high-end watches.
* As depicted in the chart above, ChangeWave Research found that one in five respondents would by an iWatch, matching the level of pre-launch interest for the iPad in the run-up to its official announcement.
* Our own mini-survey found that six out of each ten respondents would carry an iWatch on their person versus nearly three out of each ten opting for Google’s Glass augmented-reality eyewear.
* One in ten would carry neither iWatch nor Glass.
* Would you wear an Apple smartwatch designed by Jony Ive?
