* We’ve been talking quite a bit about Google Voice on the blog the last few days because Apple apparently started telling developers it was ok to submit Google Voice applications again in the App Store.
* Although he was getting everybody’s attention, developer Sean Kovacs is not the only one working on Google Voice applications, and someone actually came up with a Google Voice app before him…
* Developer Andreas Amann had his Google Voice application GV Connect [download link] approved in the App Store just minutes ago and it is currently selling for $2.99.
* To be honest with you, I’m waiting for Kovacs’ app GV Mobile+. I’ll be passing on GV Connect but if you try this application, I’d like to hear what you think about it. Let us know.
