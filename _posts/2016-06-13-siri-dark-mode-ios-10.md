* Go ahead, pull an iPhone out of your pocket right now, press and hold the Home button and tell Siri to please “turn on dark mode”.
* Much to your surprise, instead of responding with a “I didn’t quite get that”, “I don’t understand” or some such, she’ll inform you that “I’m not able to change that setting”.
* As noted by AppleInsider, the wording is unusual given that iOS currently contains no reference to any kind of dark mode. Is Apple trolling us ahead of the keynote?
* The very idea of a Mac-like dark mode in iOS 10 has already given birth to a pair of concepts, one imagining dark mode on an iPhone 7 and the other sporting detailed mockups depicting what Apple’s most popular stock apps would look like with a dark interface.

* As evidenced by your own WWDC 2016 wish list in response to our pre-WWDC roundup, a significant subset of our readers are rooting for dark mode in iOS 10.
* WWDC 2016 kicks off with a keynote today at 10am Pacific.
