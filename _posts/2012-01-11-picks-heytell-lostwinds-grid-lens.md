* Every week we bring you a few App Store apps that we find particularly useful or awesome. The App Store is full of mediocre stuff, but iDB tries to find the gems for your downloading consideration.

* HeyTell’s purpose is dead simple: to send quick voice messages quickly. Think of it has a walkie talkie without the beeping and annoying button-holding. The app uses low amounts of data and its cross-platform nature allows you to communicate between an iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad. As long as you have an internet connection, you can send and receive voice messages from the free, universal iOS app.
* A really neat feature of HeyTell is its ability to send you push notifications right when you receive a new message. If you’re into the idea of a digital walkie talkie, HeyTell is the perfect app. In-app purchases can be used to set alert tones, send group messages, and much, much more. HeyTell is available for free in the App Store.

* LostWinds is a new game from Frontier for iOS. It’s a beautiful, fresh take on platform gameplay in the App Store.
* Guide and protect Toku, a young boy and the only one who can help you release the curse placed upon the enchanting world of Mistralis and its people by evil Balasar.
* LostWinds is absorbing, beautiful and fun – an essential experience on iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. Put the power of the Wind at the tips of your fingers today!

* Like Diptic, Grid Lens allows you to create and stitch together multiple photos on your iPhone. The functionality and charm of Grid Lens makes it a step above Diptic with its ability to take photos inside the live frame.
* You can edit your collages with Instagram-like filters and share your creations on all of the popular social networks (including Instagram) in-app. Grid Lens is fast, pretty, and effective at creating multi-short photo collections on the iPhone. You can get the app for 50% off right now ($0.99) in the App Store.
* That’s it for this week’s picks! Let us know that you think of these apps in the comments.
