* As noted by MacRumors, iOS 8.4 has brought another change to the table that’s remotely related to the Music app. Audiobooks—a feature that was found in the Music app for firmware prior to iOS 8.4—has been relocated to the iBooks app.
* When you download or sync an audiobook to your iPhone, it’ll automatically appear in the Audiobooks section of the iBooks app if running iOS 8.4. Audio books feature a small headphone icon to indicate that it’s an audio book and not a normal book.

* When you tap on an audio book cover, the book will pick up immediately where you left off. You can swipe left or right on the book cover to skip ahead or go back. If you swipe and hold, the progression will continue incrementally. You can alter the amount of skip forward and skip back time via the iBooks preference panel in the stock Settings app.

* Again, this is a smart move, and it’s where audio books should have been from the get go. I’ve always thought it was weird that I had to go to the Music app to listen to audio books instead of the iBooks app. iOS 8.4 remedies this issue.
* What do you think?
