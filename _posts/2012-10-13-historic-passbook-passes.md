* This is kind of cool: the folks over at Flon Solutions, a digital ticketing company that specializes in Passbook, has created a number of custom passes from historic events.
* These events include things like the infamous Titanic voyage, the Beatles rooftop concert, and more. And you can download these passes and add them right into Passbook….
* Here are some of the different type of event passes available:
* You can add these free passes to your Passbook app by visiting Flon Solutions’ website on your mobile phone or desktop computer, and clicking the ‘Add to Passbook’ button.
* What’s really cool is that the passes are interactive. Tapping the ‘Info’ icon in the bottom righthand corner of a pass will reveal links, videos and other info about the event.
* Apple unveiled Passbook during its WWDC iOS 6 keynote this summer. It’s essentially a digital wallet for all of your gift cards, event tickets, and boarding passes. To find real Passbook passes, simply open your Passbook application, and tap ‘App Store.’
