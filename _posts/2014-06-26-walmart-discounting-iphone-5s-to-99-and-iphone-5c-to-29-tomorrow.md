* If you are planning on purchasing a new iPhone, you will be happy to hear that Walmart is discounting the 16 GB iPhone 5s to $99 (down from $149) and 16 GB iPhone 5c to $29 (down from $49) when activated on a two-year service agreement. The new prices are effective tomorrow, making this one of the better iPhone deals available in-store in the United States… 
* Walmart previously held a sales promotion that brought the two iPhone models down to similar prices before, but this time the move will be permanent. According to Engadget, the deal should be available from 9 AM local time at Walmart locations across the United States. The deal will not be available online, although there is a better deal on the web anyways.
* As we reported last night, wholesale chain Costco has began reselling iPhones and iPads for up to 70% off through its online store. The retailer is selling the 16 GB iPhone 5s for just $77.99 with a new two-year contract through AT&T, Verizon or Sprint, which is $21 cheaper than Walmart. The deal is only available online, however, whereas Walmart is selling handsets in stores.
* Whether you purchase your iPhone through Walmart or Costco, the savings are still significant compared to Apple. The 16 GB iPhone 5s retails for $199 through the Apple Store, while the cheaper iPhone 5c is $99 for the baseline model. Walmart could be looking to start clearing inventory ahead of the oft-rumored iPhone 6, which is expected to launch in three months.
* Walmart is also discounting 32 GB models, but pricing remains unknown.
* Will you take advantage of this deal?
