* Last night, iMore published a report claiming that Apple was going to unveil its new iPhone, and other products, at a media event on September 12th. The note also said that the handset would be released the following week.
* While a September launch seems a bit early, considering last year’s timeframe, evidence is really piling up in its favor. In fact, a new report is out this afternoon reaffirming the date…
* AllThingsD‘s John Paczkowski reports:
* “iMore was first to report that the company has scheduled a special event for Wednesday, September 12, and now we’ve confirmed it as well. Sources tell AllThingsD that Apple is currently planning an event for that week. And while we haven’t yet confirmed its focus, history suggests it will indeed be the new iPhone. One thing’s for certain, though: Apple is ramping up for a big fall product cycle.”
* Paczkowski’s sources have been extremely accurate in the past. AllThingsD has correctly reported on a number of Apple rumors this year including the iPad event date, and Apple’s all-new Maps application in iOS 6.
* With two accurate, but separate, sources pointing to a September 12 event, we have no reason to believe otherwise. Of course, Apple could change the date between now and then. But for right now, all systems seem to be a go.
* In addition to an all new iPhone, Apple is widely expected to unveil a smaller iPad and some new iPod products this fall. Whether those will all happen at the September event, or a separate one at a later date, still remains to be seen.
* Update: for what it’s worth, The Verge is reporting that its sources have also confirmed the September 12 event date.
* Update 2: The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple has added his weight to the proposed September event date with his usual confirming “Yep.” Jim was Macworld’s editor at large for several years and is known to have sources deep inside Apple. We suggest you mark your calendars.
