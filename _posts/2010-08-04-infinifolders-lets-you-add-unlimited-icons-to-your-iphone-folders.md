title: InfiniFolders Lets You Add Unlimited Icons to Your iPhone Folders
---
* InfiniFolders is a new application that lets you add unlimited icons to your folders. Currently you are limited to 12 apps per folder but InfiniFolders will lift this restriction and allow you to have unlimited icons in each folder.
* Very similar to InfiniBoard, you can access your apps inside folders through a flick up and down.
* InfiniFolders is available in Cydia for $1.99. It was developed by Chpwn, one of my favorite jailbreak app developer, who previously brought us InfiniBoard and InfiniDock.
* Let us know how you like InfiniFolders if you choose to download it.
