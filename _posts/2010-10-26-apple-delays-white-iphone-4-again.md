* So much for the good surprise we had this morning when the white iPhone 4 appeared in Apple’s own Apple Store application. If you thought the white iPhone 4 was just around the corner, then think again, as a spokesperson told Reuters the long awaited white model won’t be available until next Spring.
* The white iPhone 4 has been officially delayed several times now (1, 2, 3), and this is getting a little ridiculous…
* “We’re sorry to disappoint customers waiting for the white iPhone again,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. When asked why the white phone would again be delayed, Muller declined to comment.
* I don’t know about you but when “next Spring” comes, I won’t be waiting for the white iPhone 4, instead, I’ll patiently be waiting for the iPhone 5.
* Thoughts?
