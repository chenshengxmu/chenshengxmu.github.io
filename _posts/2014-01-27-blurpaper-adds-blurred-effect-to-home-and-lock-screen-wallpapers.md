* Translucency is at the heart of iOS 7 design, with blurred elements throughout the mobile platform. Often times it can be hard to find a wallpaper that looks nice with the all-new user interface, and a new jailbreak tweak called Blurpaper helps make that process easier.
* The tweak takes your current Home screen and Lock screen wallpapers — here’s some nice ones — and overlays a blurred effect on them automatically, with no respring necessary. If you want, give it a test with the wallpaper I’m using in the screenshots above. The package has a number of options to configure… 
* There are over eight different blur effects that can enabled selectively through the Blurpaper menu in the Settings app, with toggle switches for enabling or disabling blur on the Lock screen and Home screen. The blur styles included range in opacity from bright to dark: Ultra Light, Light, Adaptive Light, Semi Light, Default, Blur, Dark, Dark Zoom, Ultra Dark and Black and White. The left screenshots in this article show blur fully disabled, while the right ones have default blur enabled.

* Last are two toggles for disabling the dock tray background and separator, in addition to another for toggling Parallax wallpaper support. If you disable Parallax, your wallpaper will no longer appear to move when you tilt your device. Overall, this is an interesting tweak that gives users yet another option to customize the iOS 7 experience and make it their own.

* Blurpaper is developed by pNre, the maker of StatusBarFix2, and is available on his private repository by adding repo.pnre.co.vu to your Cydia sources. If for whatever reason the blur is not working for you, either fully or partially, the official package description recommends turning off Increase Contrast in Accessibility in the Settings app. You’ll need an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 7 or later to give this tweak a spin.
* Let us know how Blurpaper works for you in the comments.
