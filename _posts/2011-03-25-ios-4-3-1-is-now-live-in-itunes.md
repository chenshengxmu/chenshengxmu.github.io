* It appears that the latest version of iOS has been posted to iTunes today. Loading up iTunes with your iDevice plugged in may cause it to automatically update to the newest firmware. Those who are jailbroken on 4.2.1 should hold off for the official 4.3.1 jailbreak to be released before updating.
* The good news is that hackers i0n1c and Comex have been holding out on releasing their jailbreak software for 4.3.1 to be released. Now that it is, it should just be a matter of testing their exploit with 4.3.1 and making sure everything is stable.
* MacRumors is reporting that the update fixes some bugs with the iPod touch and Apple TV. They also mention it relieves the ‘Cannot Activate Cellular Network’ glitch that has been plaguing iPhone users since 4.2.1 was released.
* While the minor bug fixes would never entice me to update, the fact that an untethered jailbreak would be available for iOS 4.3.x has me foaming at the mouth. I want to take advantage of the new AirPlay enhancements that were released in 4.3 and I won’t update until an official jailbreak is released.
* Stay tuned to ziPadblog for the latest in iPad jailbreaking news.
* Has anyone updated to iOS 4.3.1? Notice any differences? Tell us below.
