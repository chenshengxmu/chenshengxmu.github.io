* India has become Apple’s test bed for emerging markets, with the company rolling out a series of discounts and payment plans in order to entice purchases and improve its market standing in the 1.24 billion people market.
* These efforts are paying off as iPhone sales have risen 400 percent over the past four months.
* That’s a dramatic increase over prior iPhone numbers in India, where sales only reached a meager 70,000 to 80,000 handsets a month. The key to such a notable jump: Apple has “figured out” the Indian market, which until now has viewed the iPhone as out of the reach of most of that nation’s consumers…
* India’s Economic Times writes:
* The Cupertino-based company has managed to dramatically push up its sales by figuring out trends of consumer demand and changing the iPhone’s perception from being a high-end product to an affordable one.
* Apple’s iPhone now has around three percent of India’s smartphone market, estimates investment firm Credit Suisse. Among the tactics Apple employed in enticing a market accustomed to purchasing inexpensive feature phones: heightened advertising, time payment plans and handset discounts.
* An installment plan allows India consumers to purchase an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S using a down payment then paying the rest over the next six or twelve months, similar to T-Mobile’s Uncarrier strategy with the iPhone 5.
* And in April, Apple announced an 18 percent discount on the iPhone 4, creating an “effective discount of 23 to 27 percent, making the handset more attractive for first-time smartphone buyers,”  writes AppleInsider.
* Earlier this month, the company also unveiled rebates on trade-ins. For instance, students could get a $134 rebate off some iPhones.
* Today’s Credit Suisse report echos a February IDC announcement estimating Apple sales to India shot up by 400 percent.
* The bigger question to ask is whether these new sales tactics are a sign of things to come from Tim Cook’s Apple or is the company merely responding to the onslaught of Android cheapos.
* Whatever the case, the results prove that price is the key factor in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and China, where the firm is widely rumored to launch a less-pricey iPhone model.
