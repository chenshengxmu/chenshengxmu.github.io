* Ahead of its earnings call pertaining to calendar 2012 fourth-quarter results scheduled for January 24, carrier AT&T just announced, reporting ‘best-ever’ sales of Apple and Android smartphones. The Dallas, Texas wireless company sold a record ten million smartphones powered by Apple’s and Google’s platform during the holiday quarter of 2012 as Android and iPhone sales hit all-time highs. The figure beats the year-ago quarter when AT&T moved 9.4 million smartphones, 7.6 million of them being iPhones.
* The “best-ever quarterly sales of Android and Apple smartphones”, according to AT&T Mobility President and Chief Executive Officer Ralph de la Vega, came down to an average of 110,000 smartphone sales each day. “These are the industry’s most valuable postpaid subscribers with average revenues twice that of non-smartphone subscribers”, he noted…
* The more than ten million smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2012 included “best-ever quarterly sales of Android and Apple smartphones”, the company confirmed.
* A media release the carrier put out this morning also quotes the executive, who said that “customers flocked” to AT&T’s portfolio of the latest Android, Apple and Windows devices.
* “Combine that with the nation’s largest 4G network and lightning-fast LTE network that now reaches more than 170 million people and you’ll understand why customers continue to choose AT&T in record numbers”, he said.
* The company stopped short of detailing smartphone sales and we don’t know how many iPhones they moved during the holiday quarter, but all should be revealed on January 24 when AT&T is scheduled to report quarterly earnings.
* Earlier this week, the company said at its annual Developers Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada that AT&T is now the world’s leading seller of Windows Phone devices.
