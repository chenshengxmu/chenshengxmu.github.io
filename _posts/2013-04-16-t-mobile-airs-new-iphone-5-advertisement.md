* T-Mobile is wasting no time touting the fact that they finally have access to the world’s best smartphone. Can you blame them? This latest creative compares T-Mobile’s contract-less plans with the competition.
* The spot features two iPhone 5’s: one surrounded by a series of mouse traps to represent being trapped within a competitor’s contract, and another, free of traps, representing T-Mobile’s new contract-free strategy.

* As you would expect, this marketing strategy isn’t about showing off the features of the iPhone 5, because everyone knows what those are by now. Instead, T-Mobile wants potential customers to know why signing up for “Big Magenta” can prove to be advantageous. What do you think about the spot?
