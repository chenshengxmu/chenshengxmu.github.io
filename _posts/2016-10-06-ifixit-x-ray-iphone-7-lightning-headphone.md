* Repair wizards over at iFixit along with their pals at Creative Electron gave Apple’s new $9 iPhone 7 Lightning headphone adapter a thorough X-ray treatment. The analysis has revealed a surprising amount of circuitry inside of the dongle.
* Most notably, it packs in a pretty unique integrated circuit that’s most likely a built-in digital-to-analog (DAC) converter. There’s actually a lot going on in the diminutive adapter aside from the DAC, writes iFixit, including things like an integrated amplifier and an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC).
* “We’re surprised how much electronics Apple was able to include inside this little cable,” said Creative Electron, which builds X-ray inspection systems for electronics.
* Prior iPhones handled both DAC and ADC functions internally via a custom Apple/Cirrus Logic chip on the logic board. The X-ray analysis of Apple’s headphone dongle reveales integrated circuitry marked “338S00140 A0SM1624 TW”.
* iFixit and Creative Electron think it’s most likely some sort of a DAC chip.
* The dongle connects legacy 3.55mm headphones to the iPhone 7, with one end providing a standard female 3.5mm port while the other is a male Lightning connector.

* Here’s a visual comparison of the CirrusLogic audio chip on the iPhone 7’s logic board next to the exposed DAC/ADC/amplifier chip in the new Lightning headphone adapter.

* The larger iPhone 7 chip “handles more than just DAC/ADC,” explains iFixit, as it also integrates a media codec. It’s not believed to contain an amplifier because there are three dedicated amplifier chips located elsewhere on the iPhone 7 logic board.
* As for audio quality:
* The takeaway seems to be that in some areas, the sound quality does measure a bit worse from the adapter than we might be accustomed to. For instance, when playing an uncompressed 16-bit audio file on the iPhone 6s, the dynamic range dropped from 99.1 dB at the headphone jack to 97.3 dB at the adapter.
* Though keep in mind, this slightly lower measurement is still higher than the theoretical maximum you get from a compact disc (which is 96 dB). So, is it a difference you are likely to notice? If you sit in a quiet room with a really, really good pair of headphones … and you’re a canine, the answer is: maybe.
* Ultimately, it appears Apple’s engineers “did their job” because, as iFixit writes, the tiny adapter seems to perform “better than most people expected or even thought possible”.
* Here are the results of a barrage of sound quality tests conducted last month by hi-fi enthusiasts at German computer tech magazine, called c’t.

* Because the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus lack the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth headsets or wired Lightning-based ones, Apple’s dongle requires DAC circuitry to convert the ones and zeros from the all-digital Lightning connector to analog signals that audio accessories like 3.5mm headphones need to work.
* By the same logic, the adapter also needs ADC circuitry to convert analog signals from a headphone’s embedded microphone into ones and zeros that are fed to the handset via the Lightning port.
* However, both new iPhone 7 models still pack in the CirrusLogic chip in order to drive their built-in loudspeakers and microphones, all of which use analog signals.
* Later this month, Apple will release its new wireless earphones, called AirPods.
* The earphones integrate a custom-designed Apple W1 chip that extends battery life over standard Bluetooth connections while supporting advanced features like zero-configuration automatic pairing, seamless switching between devices without re-pairing and more.
