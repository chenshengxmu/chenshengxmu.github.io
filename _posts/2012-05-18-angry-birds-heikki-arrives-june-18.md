* Angry Birds maker Rovio announced an unusual move today: they will release a web-only game called Angry Birds Heikki on June 18.
* While the Angry Birds series has been available on both Facebook as Chrome Web Store for some time, this is the first time they’re releasing a webgame under the Angry Birds brand name.
* What’s this one about? According to The Next Web, Angry Birds Heikki is born out of Rovio’s tie-up with Finnish Formula 1 racing driver Heikki Kovalainen – hence “Heikki” in the game’s title.
* A mini-site has just gone live, announcing Angry Birds Heikki for June 18.
* According to a post over at the official Heikki Kovalainen website, Angry Birds Heikki will feature ‘fun Angry Birds game levels with a racing theme in addition to other bespoke content”.
* The racing driver, a Finn, is “happy to be backing a Finnish company on a global platform”.
* In addition to this co-branding webgame, Rovio will soon release a brand new puzzler called Amazing Alex, a result of their acquisition of all IP rights to Casey’s Contraptions, a charming puzzle game by Snappy Touch and Mystery Coconut.
* What do you think?
* Is Rovio milking the Angry Birds franchise for all its worth with the games, merchandise and licensing deals?
