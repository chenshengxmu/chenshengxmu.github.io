* Multiplexer, the six-in-one multitasking jailbreak tweak that we previewed back in August, is now available for purchase on Cydia.
* Multiplexer brings six different jailbreak tweaks together as one, and each tweak could rightfully stand on its own as a separate download. In the package, you’ll find Aura, Empoleon, Mission Control, Quick Access, Swipe Over, and the already well-know jailbreak tweak, Reach App.
* All six of the tweaks join together to form one insanely deep package for multitasking on a jailbroken iPhone. Watch our video inside to get a preview of what to expect.
* In my hands-on with Multiplexer, I noted that it was so deep that it was a little overwhelming. I also found the tweak to be a bit slow and laggy in some areas, but again, that was just a beta version, so it’s really not fair to judge the tweak on that version.
* I’ll be back with more coverage of Multiplexer in the coming days. In the meantime, major props to developers Elijah Frederickson and Andrew Abosh for being able to pull off what is arguably the deepest tweak ever to hit Cydia.
* Multiplexer can be had for $3.99 on the BigBoss repo. Do you plan on trying it?
