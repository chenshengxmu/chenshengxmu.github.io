* Ahead of Apple Music launch tomorrow following its three-month trial period, Google at today’s event announced that its own subscription-music service, called Google Play Music, will offer a new family plan later this year.
* Like Apple Music, Google’s service costs $9.99 per month. As you know, Apple Music also offers a $14.99 per month subscription for families up to six. While Google has yet to reveal a precise timeframe for upcoming family tiers, it did confirm the pricing.
* As you might have guessed already, up to six people will be able to use one Google Play Music account in exchange for a shared fee of $14.99 a month.
* Google has multiple music offerings that need consolidating.
* In addition to Google Play Music with scan-and-match capability and free radio stations, the company also operates Google Play Music All Access and YouTube.
* As if that weren’t enough, last November they unveiled YouTube Music Key, a monthly subscription service tied to YouTube which provides background play, offline viewing, ad-free experience and other perks for $9.99 per month.

* Making matters even more confusing, it appears that YouTube will be using ad-free video viewing to sell its music service.
* According to Peter Kafka of Re/code, YouTube intends to bundle two different services into one offering:
* Video industry sources said Google intends to charge $10 a month for the combined offering, which should launch near the end of October.
* Count us confused.
