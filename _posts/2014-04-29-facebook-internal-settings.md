* Feeling a little sneaky? Want to access Facebook’s internal settings for its iOS app? If you’re jailbroken, it’s extremely easy to gain access by means of a handy new jailbreak tweak.
* The aptly entitled Facebook Internal Settings is a brand new jailbreak tweak that just landed on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. This free tweak makes accessing the super-secret (and super-confusing) internal settings a walk in the park. Have a look at our video walkthrough for more information.
* To use Facebook Internal Settings, simply install the tweak and get going. You’ll obviously need to have the official Facebook app installed on your device and you’ll need to be logged into Facebook as well, but you probably already came to that logical conclusion.
* Once you’ve met all of the aforementioned criteria, it’s time to get to the settings. Tap the More button in the bottom right-hand corner of the Facebook app interface, and then scroll all the way down to the bottom of your list of settings.
* Sitting unassumingly at the bottom of the settings rests the Internal Settings button. Tap this button, and you’ll gain access to a plethora of information that you probably have no idea what to do with. Congratulations.
* How, and more importantly why are you using Facebook’s internal settings? Sound off down below and let me know.
