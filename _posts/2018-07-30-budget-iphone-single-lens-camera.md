* Smartphone leakster Benjamin Geskin yesterday tweeted out images of alleged iPhone dummies depicting size difference between Apple’s rumored 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus and a new budget model, suggesting two major tradeoffs for the latter: the lack of a dual-lens camera in addition to the use of power-hungrier LCD screen technology.
* We would usually see real parts leak out of Asian supply chains by this time of year, but Apple seems to have clamped down on factory leaks. With new iPhones looming on the horizon and barely two months away now, we’re now at least starting to see some dummies.
* The supposed dummy units that Geskin kindly shared on Twitter might or might not be based on chassis design schematics sourced from the Chinese supply chain.

* Note the important distinction here—these are not your actual upcoming iPhones.
* Just to be clear, you’re looking at dummy units (probably 3D printed by Chinese shops based on rumor-mill reporting) that anyone can purchase online to create their own hands-on video.
* What do you make of this “leak”?
* Would you pick an iPhone X Plus (it should be the same size as iPhone 7 Plus, but with a massive 6.5-inch display) over a more affordable budget iPhone with a 6.1-inch LCD screen?
* Let us know by leaving a comment below.
