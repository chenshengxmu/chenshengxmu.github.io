* iOS 9 has brought out a new feature for iPads called easy text selection which lets you slide two fingers on the screen to turn the keyboard into a trackpad of sorts. While in this mode, you can control cursor movement and select chunks of text with precision.
* Thanks to 3D Touch, you can bring up this trackpad-esque functionality on Apple’s new iPhone 7 in order to easily select and manipulate text with great precision, here’s how.
* Step 1: Launch any app on your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and tap on the text entry field to bring up the software keyboard.
* Step 2: Simply press firmly on the keyboard to enable the software trackpad mode.
* Tip: If you want, you can control 3D Touch sensitivity to either require less or more pressure on the screen.
* While in this mode, you can do the following:
* This is yet another example why 3D Touch is not the new right-click or long-tap. Without the ability to sense varying degrees of pressure it would have been impossible to toggle between cursor movement and text selection without lifting your finger off the screen.
* Pressing the keyboard to make it behave just like a trackpad works within stock apps such as Notes, Mail and Messages, in addition to third-party apps that support standard text entry.
