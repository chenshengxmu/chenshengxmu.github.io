* Good news this afternoon for Elevation Dock owners. The company behind the Kickstarter phenomenon, Elevation Labs, has released an official Lightning adapter for the dock allowing you to use it with your shiny new iPhone 5…

* From Elevation Labs’ website (via MacRumors):
* “Use your iPhone 5 with our bolt-in swappable adapter.  Mounts your Lightning cord safely and securely at a comfortable 9.5° back angle. Works with cases. Super strong, 5-axis CNC machined from solid aluminum, tumble polished, bright red anodized. Apple cord is not included. Made in USA.”
* The adapter is just $15. And if you don’t already have an Elevation Dock, you can actually purchase one with built-in Lightning plug support directly from Elevation Lab for $89. It comes in four finishes, and ships in three weeks.
* At the moment, this looks to be one of the only docks available for the iPhone 5. Belkin’s Charge + Sync Dock, the only other Lightning-compatible cradle we’ve seen, isn’t expected to start shipping until the end of November.
