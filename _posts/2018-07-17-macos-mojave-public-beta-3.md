* Apple Beta Software Program members can now download macOS Mojave public beta 3. The update arrives just a day after the latest macOS developer beta launched.
* You can download the newest beta by visiting System Preferences and using the Software Update option on your Mac. You’ll need a previous beta version of macOS Mojave already installed to get the newest update.
* Announced in June, macOS Mojave is a much more significant release than macOS High Sierra before it. The update includes all-new features such as Stacks, Dark Mode, and a Dynamic Desktop. The update also contains Mac versions of popular iOS apps including News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home.
* The first official macOS Mojave update should arrive this fall alongside updated versions of tvOS, iOS, and watchOS.
