* The updated version of Abode’s Iota is baking in lots of smarts. We went hands-on with the smart camera that includes support for HomeKit, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and Abode RF.
* Abode had the new Iota on display at the 2018 Consumer Electronic Show and was able to give us some demonstrations.

* Aside from HomeKit, my favorite features of the Iota is that it has a built-in backup battery and supports LTE SIM cards. That means if you should ever lose power, the camera is still capable of streaming.
* What do you think of the Iota? Let us know in the comments.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
