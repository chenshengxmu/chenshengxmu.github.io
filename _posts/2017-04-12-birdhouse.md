* When you don’t have any unread notifications waiting to be acknowledged, you typically see the “No Notifications” text string in the middle of Notification Center. Not only isn’t this aesthetically pleasing, but it wastes potentially useful space.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak called Birdhouse by candoizo, you can make use of this space by replacing the generalized “No Notifications” text with a Tweet from your favorite Twitter account.
* Birdhouse not only makes this section of Notification Center nicer to look at, but it also provides somewhat of a live feed of the selected Twitter account. It always shows the latest Tweet from the account, so if you choose a news page like @iDownloadBlog, you’ll see the latest post that was shared.
* The tweak uses the official Twitter API, so you don’t have to have any Twitter-based apps installed on your device to use it, nor do you need to be following the account you chose with your own Twitter account to see Tweets from it in Notification Center.
* When you get a notification, the Tweet disappears and Notification Center displays notifications as they would normally appear until they’re dismissed. Once you dismiss it, you’ll begin seeing the Tweets once again.
* Birdhouse adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can input the Twitter account you want to see Tweets from:

* Once it’s typed in, no respring is necessary; simply leave the Settings app and then put Notification Center through a couple of open/close cycles and you’ll see the full tweet as it was intended to be seen.
* Birdhouse is definitely an interesting tweak to say the least, but it won’t be for everybody. Not everyone likes Twitter or follows a Twitter account all that closely. On the other hand, for those who do, Birdhouse might be a welcomed addition to get rid of that stock text and make something good out of it.
* If you’re interested in trying Birdhouse, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
