* The versatile media player Infuse by aTV Flash Black developer Firecore was updated this week with several new features and enhancements, including the ability to play DVD videos saved as VIDEO_TS, .dvdmedia or ISO/IMG archives.
* Other new features in Infuse 5.2 for iOS and tvOS include Library and folder search, the ability to stream media from NFS-formatted network shares, sort your media by release date and more.
* DVD file support has been one of the top feature requests since Infuse for Apple TV debuted in late 2015. If you have a pile of old DVDs, you can now convert them into the VIDEO_TS, .dvdmedia or ISO/IMG file format using a free of charge app like Handbrake.

* Then, simply store those ripped DVDs on a network share that’s connected to Infuse and let the app work its magic to turn them into the makings of a great movie night. On the downside, DVD menus are not currently supported.
* Infuse creator James Abeler says that  it’s not entirely clear if actual menus will be an option in the future but ensured he’s  working to improve the accessibly of the various titles found on a DVD.
* “This might end up being something like displaying them in the lower shelf area when viewing the details page for a particular ISO file,” he said. For now, various titles can be accessed through the playback menu (swipe down while a video is playing).
* If you see an error message while trying to play DVD ISO or VOB files, ensure that your VIDEO_TS folders are placed in another folder with the movie name as this is the folder that Infuse will recognize (i.e. Movies/Inception/VIDEO_TS/files).
* Infuse for Apple TV gained Library search in December 2016.
* With Infuse 5.2, the search feature is now available on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Simply tap the three dots in the upper right corner to search for videos in a particular folder. OR, start a search from the main menu to have the app look through everything.

* Infuse 5.2 packs in support for more video types.
* The app can now stream media from NFS-formatted network shares and will buffer content faster than before, which results in a better playback experience—especially on Apple TV. Speaking of which, Infuse for Apple TV has gained a “Newest” Library browsing filter, the ability to sort titles by release date and a new Video section in the playback menu where you can quickly select a chapter or adjust your zoom options.
* A complete list of what’s new in Infuse 5.2 can be found on Firecore’s website.

* Other enhancements being considered for future Infuse releases include these items:
* The team is toying with the idea of a macOS version, but they wouldn’t commit to a release date. For what it’s worth, Abeler told me on several occasions that Infuse for Mac might be in the works, so there’s that.
* Infuse works especially great with NAS devices like Synology accessories [review].
* Infuse 5 for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV is a free download from the App Store with optional Pro features available as a $6.49 per year subscription through the In-App Purchase mechanism (a free one-month trial of Infuse Pro is available)
