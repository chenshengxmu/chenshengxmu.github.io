* Here, you can:
* HapLock is simple by design, and so it’s not flooded with excessive configuration options. What you see here is the bare minimum for what you’d need to great the ideal setup. Furthermore, you don’t need to respring your device to save any settings you change.
* Another thing worth noting is that HapLock works on all 64-bit devices whether they sport taptic engines or classic vibrator motors. But while both work just fine, the best user experience will be had on devices with the newer taptic engine because of its added versatility.
* If you’re interested in trying HapLock, then you can download the tweak for free from Cydia’s Packix repository. The tweak appears to support jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices, but keep in mind that 32-bit devices aren’t supported.
