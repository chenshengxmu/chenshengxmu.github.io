* Earlier today, during Apple’s WWDC 2015 media event, the Cupertino company announced software updates to iOS, OS X, and watchOS. As with previous software updates, Apple always highlights a new title wallpaper for the announcement.
* The iOS 9 wallpaper, showed several times during the presentation, pictures the inner curl of a beautifully blue wave. Naturally, we already received requests for the image. Step inside for your reward.
* [updated 6/9/15 11:45PM PDT] The actual image was finally extracted from the iOS 9.0 beta and we located it via Reddit user geepolkgee. Click here to download this massive iOS wallpaper for both iPhone and iPad at 2712 x 2706.
* The image download contained herein is not the actual image from iOS 9. It has not been extracted from the root files. Instead, this is a near representation created by graphic artist @AR72014.

* Undoubtedly, more images will surface and they too will be collected by me via @jim_gresham. I anticipate multiple comments about a native iPhone 6 Plus version, iPad option, and an OS X desktop image. They aren’t included here, because I am yet to find them. Stay tuned for updates.
