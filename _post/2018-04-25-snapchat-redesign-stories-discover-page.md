* Snapchat may be planning to revert one of the biggest changes in its recent redesign.
* As Recode said yesterday, the company is rolling out a redesign to the recent app redesign for a small group of users. It basically puts friend content and professional content back on the Discover page, similar to how it was before the controversial redesign was rolled out.
* Before the Snapchat mobile app redesign late last year, user-generated Stories coexisted on the Discover page alongside Stories from brands, celebrities and publishers.
* “We are always listening to our community and will continue to test updates that we hope will give Snapchatters the best possible experience on our platform,” the company said. It probably found people were creating fewer Stories following user backlash over the redesigned app.
* The company has even responded to a Change.org petition asking Snapchat to roll things back to the way they were. Snapchat says it will “continue to test updates” so watch this space to learn when this redesign that’s currently being tested might be rolling to everyone.
