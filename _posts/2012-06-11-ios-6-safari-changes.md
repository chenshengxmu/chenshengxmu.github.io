* While it isn’t necessarily the complete rebuild we were hoping for, Apple announced today that mobile Safari is going to be getting some improvements and a few new features with iOS 6.
* The headlining new addition is iCloud Tabs, which will sync all of your open tabs from the desktop Safari app with iOS. Don’t use desktop Safari? Don’t worry, there’s more…
* Also new to Safari in iOS 6 is Offline Reading List. This will enable users to save entire webpages — not just links — in Reading List, so you can take your favorite articles with you.
* Users will also now be able to upload photos from their device’s Camera Roll to sites like Craigslist and eBay from within the new Safari, and browse the web full-screen (in landscape mode).
* Still not sold on the new mobile Safari? Stay tuned for our hands-on coverage of iOS 6.
