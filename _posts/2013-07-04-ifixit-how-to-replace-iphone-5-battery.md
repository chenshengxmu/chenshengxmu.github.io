* Teardown experts over at iFixit know a thing or two about repairing consumer electronics and just yesterday they posted a nice video walkthrough explaining the process of replacing your iPhone 5’s battery. So, if your battery died on you and you’re eager to bring life back yourself to the device with a new one, block out your next hour, grab your screwdrivers and prying tools and arm yourself with patience and a steady hand…
* The process starts with removing the front panel assembly from the rear case, which requires removing the two 3.6 mm Pentalobe screws next to the Lightning connector prior to pressing a suction cup onto the screen.
* I’ll just let the video do the talking.

* The step-by-step guide is available on the iFixit website.
* Everything you need – a Pentalobe screwdriver, a Phillips #01 screwdriver, a suction cup, and some tiny tools to detach the screen and battery connections – is included in iFixit’s $100 Liberation Kit (and then some more).
* Speaking of which, iFixit is currently offering some notable savings on the iPhone Liberation Kits (currently over $30 off) as part of its Liberation Week, which ends tomorrow, July 5.
* You may also want to get an iPhone 5 or the iPhone 4/4S Liberation Kit (includes a Pentalobe screwdriver and replacement screws), now available for $0 (normally a $19.95 value) with free shipping, while supplies last.
* iFixit how-to videos on replacing your iPhone 5’s Home button and display assembly are also available. By the way, a replacement battery for the iPhone 5 can be found for a few bucks on eBay and elsewhere.
* Should you not feel confident enough to go through the process yourself, remember that Apple’s standard one-year iPhone warranty includes a free replacement for a battery that no longer holds enough energy to power your device.
* Specifically, Apple will replace your battery if it drops below 50 percent of its original capacity during the plan’s coverage period. If it’s out of warranty, the company will happily sell you a battery replacement for $79, plus $6.95 shipping, subject to local tax.
