* Inbox fans needn’t put up with those ugly black bars at the top and bottom of their iPhone X display anymore because Google has finally updated the beloved gesture-driven email client with full support for the edge-to-edge Super Retina OLED panel on the flagship smartphone.
* The update brings the app up to version 1.3.180617.
* Even though Inbox is one of the highest-rated Google apps, the Internet giant took more than eight months to update it. To give you some context, iPhone X came out in November 2017.
* In hindsight, building iPhone X support into Gmail and Inbox proved tricky as Google’s been busy working on a major redesign for Gmail’s web interface. Gmail’s interface got optimized for the iPhone X display in December 2017 a month after the flagship handset went on sale.
* The Inbox app, however, took a lot longer to update than Google expected because the team did a bunch of crazy one-off interface stuff that the handset’s taller screen totally broke.
* On a related note, Gmail for iPhone and iPad got updated today, too.
* “You can now stay focused without interruption by turning on high priority notifications for your important messages,” as per release notes for the version 5.0.180617 download.
* Inbox for iOS can be downloaded at no charge via App Store.
* Gmail is also available free from App Store.
