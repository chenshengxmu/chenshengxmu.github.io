* Apple may not be ready to introduce its TV set at today’s iPad event, but the project does appear to be nearing completion. This according to comments made by Advanced Research’s Masahiko Ishino, in a recent interview with Bloomberg.
* Citing anonymous sources, the Tokyo-based analyst tells the news outlet that the Cupertino company is preparing to begin selling ultra-high definition televisions next year. The TV will come in 55″ and 65″ flavors, with a frameless design…
* Here’s Bloomberg:
* “Apple Inc. (AAPL) will probably start selling ultra-high definition televisions with 65- and 55-inch screens during the fourth quarter of next year, according to a Tokyo-based analyst at Advanced Research Japan Co.
* The Cupertino, California-based company is deciding on specifications, and the models likely will have a frameless design, Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Advanced Research, said in an interview Oct. 18. Ishino declined to identify the people who gave him the information.”
* Ishino goes on to say that Apple’s TV is expected to be priced between $1,500 to $2,500, and LG, Samsung, and Corning will be among its suppliers. LG will make the displays, Samsung the GPUs, Corning the glass, and Foxconn will assemble.

* While we’re not very familiar with this particular analyst’s track record for Apple intel, his predictions do line up with a number of reports we’ve heard in recent months. Here’s one from August regarding Foxconn, and one from July on LG.
* It’s worth noting that there are currently a handful of 4K TVs on the market, but most of them are priced out of reach of the average consumer. And like the early days of HDTV, there’s still not a lot of content available in ultra-high definition.
* But Apple, with its legendary supply chain command and arsenal of iTunes content, certainly has the power to overcome these obstacles. The question is, will it be ready by next fall? I’m still on the fence about this one. What do you think?
