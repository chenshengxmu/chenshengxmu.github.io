* The wallpaper is one of the first things you notice every time you use your device, whether you’re glancing at the Lock screen to view the time, or accessing the Home screen to launch an app. With that in mind, shouldn’t your wallpaper captivate your interest?
* It can be challenging to choose a single wallpaper to use all the time, but with a new free jailbreak tweak called UnsplashWalls by iOS developer ipad_kid, you won’t have to. It can keep things exciting by randomizing your iPhone’s wallpaper on demand.
* As the name implies, UnsplashWalls sources new wallpapers from Unsplash, a popular website for free stock images. Fortunately, the tweak automatically maintains the appropriate resolution upon setting images as your wallpaper, so they should never look distorted or stretched.
* To start using the tweak after installation, you should visit the preference pane to configure its settings:

* Here, you can decide whether wallpaper images get saved to the Camera Roll or not, and you can assign Activator gestures to any of the following actions:

* Once satisfied with your Activator gesture selections, you can invoke one whenever you’re ready. Within a few moments, your wallpaper should change to an entirely random image taken from Unsplash.
* If you happen to come across a wallpaper that you don’t like, use the Activator gesture once more to update it yet again. Notably, there seems to be a delay that prevents your wallpaper from being changed too many times consecutively. If you encounter this, then merely wait a few moments and try again; it should work after some persistence.
* Anyone interested in trying UnsplashWalls can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 7-10 devices, and you’ll require Activator to configure the wallpaper-changing gestures.
* Note: You can implement a similar wallpaper-changing experience on your Mac with Irvue. Check out our full post about it to learn how it’s used.
