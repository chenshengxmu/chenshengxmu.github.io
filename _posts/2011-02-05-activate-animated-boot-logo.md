* A few days ago, we reported about the “big surprise” that was going to be included in the latest release of GreenPois0n: custom animated boot logos. Now that GreenPois0n is out, you can fairly easily add a boot logo.
* All you need is a jailbroken iPhone, basic SSH knowledge, and about 5 minutes of your time. Without further ado, here are instructions on how to add an animated boot logo to your iPhone…
* Step 1: Jailbreak your iPhone with GreenPois0n.
* Step 2: Download this file.
* Step 3: SSH into your iPhone and copy the file you downloaded in the previous step in /usr/bin/.
* Step 4: Change the permission of this file to 755.
* Step 5: Reboot your iPhone. You’re done!
* If you don’t like this animated logo, you can always remove it by deleting the file in /usr/bin/.
* According to JayWalker, you will soon be able to install custom boot logos directly from Cydia so if you don’t want to deal with SSH, just wait until tomorrow.
