* There are only a few movies over several years that make a lasting impression on the viewer. Movies are created, launched, watched, and forgotten. However this season’s Interstellar continues to grip audiences worldwide. The three-hour space odyssey piques the imagination and is arguably one of the most well written blockbuster movies in many years.
* To fully enjoy the experience, I went to see the film in IMAX. The stunning visuals were all wallpaper worthy shots. I try not to toss around this word lightly, but Interstellar was epic, from the story and character development to the cinematography.
* To capture some of the beauty from the IMAX screen to your iOS device screen, four Interstellar wallpapers are included below. I am particularly excited about the two wallpapers from the flooded planet, which was the crew’s first stop in the exploration.
