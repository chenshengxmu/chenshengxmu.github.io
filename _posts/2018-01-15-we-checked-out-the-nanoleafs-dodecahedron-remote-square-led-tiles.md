* The Nanoleaf Aurora is one of my favorite HomeKit accessories. At CES 2018, they’ve announced a pair of new products, that are both seriously cool. The 12-sided HomeKit remote, as well as the touch-sensitive square LED tiles.
* The dodecahedron remote is one of my new favorites, allowing you to not only control your lights, but any HomeKit scenes. This is way more powerful than your usual HomeKit button with 2-4 different options.
* They’ve also announced their newest light, the touch-sensitive square tiles that can be activated by pressing on the panels.
* Check out both in our hands-on video before they are released later this year.

* Also of note, the touch-sensitive panels seen in the latest square tiles will be coming to their flagship triangle tiles on the Aurora.
* Let us know what you think of the new HomeKit products down in the comments.
* Stay up to date with all our other CES coverage.
