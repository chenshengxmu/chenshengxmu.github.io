* So, today is officially V-day, a.k.a. Verizon day. To celebrate, everyone’s invited, and I do mean, everyone.
* Walmart is the latest retailer to get their grubby hands on the Verizon iPhone 4 at launch, making it apparent that Apple wants to move the iPhone 4 into commodity status.
* Not that the iPhone 4 was some rare luxury device to begin with or anything, but c’mon, it’s Walmart…
* “We’re excited to bring iPhone 4 on the Verizon Wireless network, one the most anticipated mobile phone launches in recent history, to Walmart customers,” noted Gary Severson, senior vice president of Home Entertainment for Walmart.
* So that makes Apple, Verizon, Best Buy, and now Walmart, places where you can theoretically walk in and score an iPhone 4 today.
* Either Apple has made a boatload of these things, or there’s going to be some awfully disappointed would-be adopters.
* We’re sending out our iPhone army of ants to scope the scene, ensuring we have first hand reports of today’s antics. Stay safe out there.
* Ya’ll going to Walmart?
