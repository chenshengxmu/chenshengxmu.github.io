* There’s certainly no shortage of impressive demos of awesome augmented reality apps made possible by Apple’s new ARKit framework in iOS 11, but this new proof-of-concept app from independent game developer Duncan Walker certainly takes things up a notch.
* Using ARKit and the Unity 3D graphics engine, Walker basically created a film experiment that puts virtual robot commanders on the street side by side with real humans.
* To accomplish this, he first captured footage of real-life humans walking down the street with his iPhone 7.
* As The Next Web notes, he then rendered the Unity-modeled virtual robots directly into the video, syncing the virtual objects almost perfectly to the shaky hand-held camera dynamics.
* The end result looks almost too real to be believed, and here it is.

* I was particularly impressed with the dynamic grounding shadows, even if they’re not perfect. Walker noted that his next experiment will put directional lights in the scene.
* How do you like this new ARKit demo?
