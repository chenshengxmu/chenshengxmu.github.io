* John Paczowski of BuzzFeed reports Apple plans to show the rumored, redesigned, Apple TV this June at the World Wide Developers Conference, notably featuring an App Store and Siri.
* The report echoes previous rumors, and Paczowski says Apple is finally ready to take the Apple TV from a “hobby” to a serious device through a significant overhaul to make it ready to take on the rest of the cluttered set-top box market.
* Past new software, the new Apple TV box itself will feature an updated, slimmer design. Inside the device, the report says you’ll find Apple’s latest A8 system-on-chip (or at least a variant of it) and an increase in storage to house the upgraded operating system and app downloads from an App Store.
* At WWDC, Apple will show off a new software kit that will allow developers to populate the Apple TV’s App Store with apps.

* Apple’s plans for the television have been becoming more clear over the past few days, as the Wall Street Journal detailed Apple’s plans for a web TV service that will work on the Apple TV. Apple is said to unveil this new $30 to $40 per month service at WWDC in June and launch it in September.
* Apple first hinted plans it’s doing something with the Apple TV line when it cut the price from $99 to just $69 at a recent media event and announced a new partnership with HBO.
* Previously, Mark Gurman of 9to5mac reported Apple has a redesigned Apple TV in the works with a slimmer design and App Store.
