* According to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Wired, the rumors were in fact true as the next iPhone is reportedly going to have a Near-Field Communication (NFC) circuitry and feature an Apple-branded payment platform.
* Apple’s contactless mobile payment solution is being described in the report as “one of the hallmark features” of the iPhone 6 when the device is unveiled on September 9 (alongside a rumored Apple wearable device).
* “We’re told the solution will involve NFC,” reads the report.
* For what it’s worth, the reliable John Paczkowski of Re/code has “been hearing the same” about the NFC-enabled iPhone 6.
* Recent leaks of purported iPhone 6 components have indicated that the forthcoming smartphone could indeed be outfitted with an NFC chip by a semiconductor company called NXP, which currently supplies the M7 motion coprocessor for the latest iOS devices.
* Earlier this month and back in June, VentureBeat learned from a source that the next iPhone has a socket reserved for an NFC chip that will “make the new phones able to do mobile payments” (Morgan Stanley approves this message).
* According to the publication, the NXP chip’s element and radio reserve enough memory to “encrypt, decrypt, and sign data packets coming from financial applications” on the iPhone 6.
* According to the Wired article, an Apple-branded mobile wallet will tap the more than 800 million iTunes accounts with credit cards on file.
* Conventional wisdom has it that any such solution would rely heavily on Touch ID for approving payments and maybe involve Passbook, an iOS application/service which stores users’ tickets, loyalty cards, coupons and other digital items.
* It’s worth mentioning that Apple owns several patents pertaining to a mobile payment solution, including this massive iWallet invention.
* Combing through Apple’s patent filings, the solutions proposed by the firm involve using short-range NFC and Bluetooth networking to establish a secure connection between the payment terminal and an iOS device to complete transactions.

* Any sensitive data such as the transaction itself or a user’s credit card information would be of course encrypted and stored inside a “secure element” in the device’s hardware.
* The Information previously corroborated [subscription required] that Apple’s solution would store sensitive financial information in a “so-called secure element, adding that Apple discussed its payment service with a number of payment companies.
* Last but not least, Apple has been hiring engineers left and right with expertise in “building a business around the hundreds of millions of credit cards it already has on file.”
* Currently, the Secure Enclave segment on the A7 chip is isolated from the rest of the system and is used to store a user’s algorithmic representation of fingerprint data rather than actual fingerprint scans.
* Several industry players have jumped on the NFC bandwagon.
* In addition to Google and its own Google Wallet service available from select carrier partners and on compatible NFC-enabled Android devices, U.S. carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon back in 2010 formed a joint mobile payment venture, called Isis.
* On the downside, these contactless payment systems have yet to see rapid-fire adoption worldwide and some watchers have suggested that Apple is in the best position to mainstream paying with our mobile phones.
* Would you use an iPhone 6 as your wallet?
