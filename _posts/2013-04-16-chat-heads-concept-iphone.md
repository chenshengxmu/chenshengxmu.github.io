* This is admittedly, a very rough demo, but it does give us a rough idea as to how Chat Heads might look on iOS. I’d say it’s only a matter of time before a jailbreak developer implements Facebook’s Chat Heads in some way, shape, or form throughout iOS.
* What do you think? Perhaps it could be an extension of biteSMS, or maybe it could be a standalone feature? Whatever the case may be, I believe that the only variable here is time.
* What do you think? Would you like to see Chat Heads throughout the entirety of iOS? Or do you think it should be a feature that’s only found within the Facebook app? Share your thoughts below. Special thanks to @iPhoneman2K for the link.
