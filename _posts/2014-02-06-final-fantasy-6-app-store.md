* Great news this morning for all of you Final Fantasy fans. Square Enix’s mobile version of the series’ classic sixth episode is now available in the App Store and can be downloaded for both the iPhone and the iPad.
* Final Fantasy VI first debuted in 1994, and is highly regarded as one of the best titles in the franchise. And for its iOS debut, the game has been completely rebuilt with easy touch controls and enhanced graphics…

* From the App Store description:
* The War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.
* But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic–a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire’s clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.
* And a few of the game’s top features:
* – Game data saved with iCloud can now be shared across devices! At home or away, on your iPhone or iPad, pick the play style that’s best for you. – All graphics have been painstakingly recreated, bringing the world of FINAL FANTASY VI to your mobile device for the very first time! Kazuko Shibuya, one of the graphics designers involved in the FINAL FANTASY series from the very start, personally worked on the main characters and supervised the recreation of the game’s graphics. – Square Enix’s vast experience in A-list smartphone RPG titles has been harnessed in implementing intuitive user-friendly controls that make the game easy to play on touch screens. The battle interface has received particular attention, with a complete overhaul for use on your smartphone. – This smartphone release includes the new magicites and events that were introduced in the 2006 remake.
* And finally a gameplay clip via TouchArcade:
* I’m not familiar enough with the FF games to draw a comparison between this and the original. But what I can say is that this is a legitimate console game—no freemium nonsense here—so fans can jump in, worry-free.
* If nothing else, FF6 seems at least on par with the other FF iOS titles, which have all been very well-reviewed. Unfortunately, they also share the same price tag. You can find Final Fantasy VI in the App Store for $16.
