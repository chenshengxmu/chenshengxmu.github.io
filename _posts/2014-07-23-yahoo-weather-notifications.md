* Yahoo’s excellent Weather app for the iPhone and iPad is among the best weather apps on our 2013 list. Today, the app has received a new feature allowing you to take advantage of notifications based on your favorite locations.
* You can customize the new Daily Notifications and elect to receive them for specific locations and Yahoo will deliver your weather updates in the form of notifications twice per day – once in the morning to prepare for the coming day and once in the evening with the next day’s weather…
* You can dive into the app’s settings to choose the times of day when your morning and evening notifications get delivered, as well as enable notifications for specific locations.
* Push Notifications must be enabled for Yahoo Weather for Daily Notifications to be activated.
* Release notes for Yahoo Weather 1.5.6:
* Twice daily customizable notifications for your favorite locations: Once in the morning to prepare for the coming day, and once in the evening with the next day’s weather.
* I’m liking this update.
* There are many great weather apps in the App Store, but Yahoo is among the prettiest – if not most gorgeous – apps available to track your weather forecast.
* The ability to get customizable weather notifications delivered twice per day to my device as native notifications will surely allow me to better plan for the day ahead.
* Although Yahoo already uses Weather Channel for data, Apple’s iOS 8 is retrieving weather data directly from the Weather Channel (here’s why), with the stock iOS 8 Weather app now providing 10-day forecast as a bonus.
* Snapshots of weather are also available via Yahoo’s recently updated Mail for iPad and inside its main iOS app, along with snapshots of stocks, sports, popular photos, videos and more.
* Download Yahoo Weather free in the App Store.
* The app is universal and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
