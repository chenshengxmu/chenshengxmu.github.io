* The iPhone’s browser, Safari, is considered to be one of the fastest and most stable mobile browsers out there. But since Google released their new Chrome for Android mobile browser last week (currently in beta), does Safari still defend its title?
* The folks over at the popular Android blog, Android Central, took it in their hands to compare the two browsers…
* So both Chrome on Android and Safari on the iPhone 4S score 100 out of 100 on the Acid3 test, which checks to see if the browser complies with various web standards. Good to see. SunSpider benchmarks how a browser handles Javascript tasks. Chrome on Android has consistently edged out Safari, in our testing.
* In their testing, Android Central found that Chrome for Android beats the iPhone 4S in handling Javascript tasks. Both browsers scored a perfect 100 on the Acid3 test, which measures a browser’s ability to compile various web standards.
* When it comes to smoothness, Safari was much better with scrolling, zooming, and panning than Chrome for Android. It’s worth noting that Chrome for Android is still a beta product, but Safari looks to have Chrome beat for now.
* Which browser do you think is better?
