* AT&T just pushed out a press release announcing that it will be carrying the iPhone 5. As Apple announced, customers will be able to pre-order it on September 14, or purchase it on the 21st.
* But far more interesting is the fact that AT&T also mentioned in the press release that customers that still have unlimited data plans, will be able to keep using them with the new iPhone…
* 9to5Mac points to the release, which indicates that customers who have had their unlimited plan since the original iPhone will be able to keep it and still buy an iPhone 5 at the subsidized price.
* ““We are thrilled to offer iPhone 5 on the nation’s largest 4G network. We’ve worked with Apple since the original in 2007 and this is hands-down their best phone yet,” said Ralph de la Vega, president & CEO, AT&T Mobility. “We offer customers the flexibility to keep the iPhone data plans they already have or choose any of our individual or new Mobile Share plans.”
* This is great news for AT&T customers, as users with unlimited plans were expecting to lose them upon upgrading to the iPhone 5. Verizon, for example, will be forcing upgraders to switch to a new data plan.
* Keep in mind, however, that customers won’t be able to make FaceTime calls over cellular on their unlimited plans. And we’re not sure if they’ll be able to utilize AT&T’s LTE network. But hey, at least it’s something.
