* It’s that time of the week again, and while things really haven’t been that exciting for the jailbreak community these last couple of weeks, some jailbreak tweak developers have still been cranking out their fair share of modifications you can install to trick out your jailbroken iOS devices.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released in Cydia this week, starting with the ones we consider our favorites, and then moving on to the rest afterwards.
* Noctis9 – $2.00

* Noctis9 is a great new jailbreak tweak release that brings a dark mode-like aesthetic to your jailbroken iPhone or iPad.
* Its effects are seen throughout the transparent interfaces of iOS, including 3D Touch menus, application folders, Control Center, the dock, and the volume HUD.
* While the tweak doesn’t include night mode-like features for the rest of iOS, it goes along nicely with a more fully-featured tweak like Eclipse or Nightmode9, which bring darker interfaces to even your apps.
* Noctis9 offers a number of settings that can be configured to your liking, so to learn more about it, check out our full review.
* ReachBoard – FREE

* ReachBoard is a super cool jailbreak tweak release that lets you see the contents of your iOS clipboard inside the Reachability view of your iPhone.
* Because the Reachability view is usually wasted space that never gets used, this tweak takes advantage of that. It supports text, tappable URLs, and even pictures that might be stored in your clipboard.
* It’s nice that the URLs are interactive, because sometimes you might save a link for later and intend to click on it when you’re ready. It’s also nice to see text and pictures that might be in your clipboard, as you can easily compare them to another interface with this tweak.
* You can read our full review of ReachBoard to learn more about how it works.
* DarkNumberBadge: Makes the number badge notifications on your apps dark instead of light (free)
* Heart Throb: Adds a double-tap gesture to the Photos app for favoriting photos (free – review)
* LargeCCKnobs: Makes the Control Center slider knobs on iOS 9 bigger, like in iOS 10 (free – review)
* Pyro: Brings new useful features for power users to the Tinder app for iOS (free)
* While that wraps it up for this week, you can bet next week will be sure to introduce even more jailbreak tweaks to the Cydia store. At iDB, we’ll be keeping you updated on all of the latest jailbreak news, add-ons, and the best jailbreak tutorials to keep you going.
* In the meantime, if you’re looking for more jailbreak tweaks right now, we’d suggest checking out last week’s roundup to ensure you haven’t missed anything special.
