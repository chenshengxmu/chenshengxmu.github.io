* Target announced an in-house mobile payments system today, called Wallet, which is making its debut within the company’s official shopping app for iPhone and iPad.
* The Wallet feature lets you pay at Target stores using your REDcard and save with Cartwheel. For those wondering, REDcards are Target-branded credit or debit cards with special offers.
* Any savings are automatically applied to your Target REDcard with a single scan of your iPhone at checkout, provided you’ve scanned your coupon barcodes beforehand.
* According to Target itself:
* One big benefit is faster in-store checkout—up to four times faster than other payment types, in fact. (We timed it!) Another perk? Wallet combines digital savings—Cartwheel offers and Weekly Ad coupons—with the 5 percent REDcard discount.
* This new feature is also available in Target’s mobile app for Android. Or, if you’re unimpressed, you can continue using Apple Pay with the Target app on iOS as a payment option.
* They will be adding more features in the future, including the ability for guests to also store and redeem Target GiftCards with Wallet.
* Download Target’s shopping app for free in App Store.
