* Looking for a unique way to spice up that jailbroken device of yours? Then look no further than a new jailbreak tweak called Vision by veteran iOS developer Elias Limneos.
* Vision gives your Home screen icons a three-dimensional makeover and makes them responsive to movement. Best of all, the effects provided by the tweak are fully customizable.
* As you can see in our examples above, Vision has a slew of different three-dimensional shapes you can choose from; six in total. To respond to movement, Vision takes advantage of your device’s accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, like so:

* Your app icons have the freedom to rotate a full 360º, so your wrist is the only thing limiting their range of movement.
* Vision also adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak:

* Here, you can do all the following:
* All options you configure will take effect without respringing your device; that said, you can check out the changes you make immediately to ensure you like what you see.
* Because Vision is GPU-heavy, it won’t run as well on older devices. Limneos says that the tweak works on iPhone 5 and later, but I personally wouldn’t run it on anything slower than an iPhone 6,. If you experience unwanted slowness, try disabling things like light reflection and motion blur to reduce the strain on system resources.
* Obviously, the tweak isn’t for everyone. If you’re heavily invested in the world of cosmetic customization, or themes, then you might be more interested in Vision than the guy who only jailbreaks to add new functional features to iOS.
* Overall, Vision is a fun and quirky tweak to make any jailbroken iOS 8-10 device stand out from the rest, and if you’re interested in trying it out, you can download the tweak from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $2.99.
