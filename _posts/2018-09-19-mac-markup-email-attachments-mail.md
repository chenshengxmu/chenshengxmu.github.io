* Whether you want to annotate an image for work, mark up a photo for fun, or add your signature to a PDF, it’s easy to do with the Mac Mail Markup tool. You have all the basics you need to add shapes, text, signatures, drawings, and more to your email attachments. And, here’s how to use this cool feature.
* With your Mail app open and the window to compose a new email, just follow these steps:
* 1) Insert your image or PDF file. You can do this by using the buttons in the compose mail toolbar, dragging and dropping the file from your computer, or clicking File from the main menu and selecting Attach Files.
* 2) Click the attachment in your message and access the Markup tool. If you have the Markup button in your compose mail toolbar, click it. Otherwise, you can click the arrow on the top right of the file and select Markup.

* 3) Your attachment will then display in the Markup window where you can begin annotating it.
