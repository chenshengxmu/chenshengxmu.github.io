* As first noted by 9to5Mac, Apple’s seventh-generation iPod nano has just received a software update to version 1.0.4.
* The free-of-charge software update can be applied by connecting your iPod nano with a Lightning cable to a Mac or Windows PC and firing up iTunes.
* The firmware update “does not appear to change any major functionality with the small touchscreen device” nor does it add support for Apple Music.
* As such, it’s most likely a maintenance or bug-fix release. We’ll post the full changelog as soon as Apple publishes details about this update.
* Apparently, a bug in the current beta release of OS X El Capitan can cause iTunes to crash right before the update is about to begin installing.
* The seventh-generation iPod nano was announced on September 12, 2012.
* It introduced Bluetooth 4.0 support for compatible wireless headsets and heart-rate monitors. Billed as the “thinnest iPod nano yet,” it’s 38 percent thinner at 5.4 mm than its predecessor, which measured 8.78 mm in depth.
* This summer, Apple released a sixth-generation iPod touch while adding new color options to the iPod nano. Other than the new colors, Apple did not make any hardware changes to the device’s internals, like increased internal storage which still maxes out at sixteen gigabytes.
