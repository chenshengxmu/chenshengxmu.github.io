title: How to Fix iOS 4 Exchange Sync Problems
---
* After updating to iOS 4, you might have encountered issues when syncing your Microsoft Exchange account. I know I did. Immediately after setting up Google Sync on my iPhone iOS 4, the sync took forever to complete. I ended up deleting and adding the account several times but it didnâ€™t really fix the issue as it would still take forever to sync new contacts or new events in the calendar.

* According to this Apple Support ticket, I am not the only one. Here are the symptoms: immediately after updating to iOS 4, some users may notice that Exchange ActiveSync Mail, Contacts, or Calendars do not sync, or sync very slowly. In addition, some Exchange Server administrators may notice their servers running slowly.
* Here is the fix offered by Apple:
* To work around this issue, users should install a configuration profile from Apple that increases the amount of time the iOS 4 device will wait for the Exchange Server to respond to its sync requests. For best results, the profile should be installed on as many iOS 4 devices at your company as possible.
* To install the profile:
* After installation, the profile will be listed under Settings > General > Profile.
* Have you had this issue? If so, did this fix work for you?
