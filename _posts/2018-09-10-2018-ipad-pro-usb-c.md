* Introduced in September 2012 to replace the aging 30-pin dock connector, Apple’s proprietary Lightning port featured on iOS devices might be replaced on this year’s iPad Pro models in favor of USB-C, the latest industry standard in connectivity.
* That’s according to Ming-Chi Kuo, a revered analyst who in April departed KGI Securities, Taiwan’s second-largest securities firm, but continues to cover Apple. In his research note issued to clients Monday, obtained by MacRumors, the analyst predicts Apple would phase out Lightning I/O on 2018’s iPad Pros before potentially bringing USB-C to the iPhone line.
* It’s unclear if Lightning-based accessories would work without hiccups on the new tablets, if some sort of an adapter might be needed or whether Apple plans to include one in the box.

* “In addition to Face ID support, we expect the new iPad Pro models’ main upgrade to include replacing Lightning with a USB-C interface and bundling with a new unibody design 18W power adapter,” according to Kuo’s most recent research note.

* The new adapter would support the fast charge feature, which on iPhone X, iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus charges the battery from zero to fifty percent in thirty minutes thanks to the USB Power Delivery standard, as supported by Apple’s own USB power adapters for iPad and Mac.
* Kuo believes the USB-C upgrade will enhance the charging and data transmission speeds. The main beneficiaries of the move to USB-C would be suppliers Lucshare ICT and Cypress, the latter pegged as a maker of Power Delivery-compliant chips for 2018 iPad Pros.
* As for 2018 iPhones, they’ll continue using the Lightning interface and bundle the current tiny five-watt power adapter, according to the revered analyst.
* What do you make of this, guys?
