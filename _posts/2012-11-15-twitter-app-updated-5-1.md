* Hot on the heels of Facebook issuing an update to its mobile apps, Twitter has done the same for its official iOS clients. The update brings the Twitter app to version 5.1, and includes some nice enhancements like an improved search and Discovery tab, and new account management features…
* From the release notes:
* The fact that photos now show up at the top of search queries is particularly interesting. A few weeks ago, reports surfaced that Twitter was looking to up its photo sharing offerings with Instagram-like filters and other improvements.
* If you’re interested in checking out the new Twitter, you can find it in the App Store, for free.
