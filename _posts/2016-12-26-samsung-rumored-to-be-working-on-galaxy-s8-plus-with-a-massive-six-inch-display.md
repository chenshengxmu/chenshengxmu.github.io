* Samsung’s next Galaxy update should include a brand new Plus model thought to incorporate a huge six-inch display, putting the device in the phablet territory usually dominated by Note-branded devices, according to a sketchy report from Korea. If true, it’s likely a response to the disastrous Note 7 launch that led to a global Note 7 recall and discontinuation.
* By comparison, Note 7 had a 5.7-inch 1440p Super AMOLED display. The current Galaxy S7 smartphone has a display size of 5.1 inches while its Edge variant rocks a 5.5-inch wraparound display.
* Samsung is likely to release a new Note model next year alongside multiple Galaxy S8 handsets. That’s because, as the report states, the South Korean conglomerate originally wanted to engineer 2017 Galaxies with S Pen in mind but ultimately decided against shipping them with a stylus.
* The six-inch Galaxy S8 is likely to be costlier for customers due to pricier components.
* Previous reports alleged that 2017 Galaxies will run Samsung’s new assistant based on advanced AI technology it recently acquired, drop the 3.5mm headphone jack, adopt USB-C and get rid of the physical Home button in favor of an in-screen button.
* The Plus model may also feature dual cameras and a 4K screen resolution.
* Apple, too, is expected to add a brand new handset model to the iPhone family next year in the form of iPhone 8. It’s expected to feature an AMOLED display curved along the wide sides of the screen with an active display area measuring between 5.1 and 5.2 inches, according to well-informed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities.
* The current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus series is expected to continue with 2017 LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus refreshes. For more Galaxy S8-related news and rumors, see our archive.
