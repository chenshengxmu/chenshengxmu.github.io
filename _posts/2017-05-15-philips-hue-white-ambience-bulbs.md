* The candle bulb joins the company’s existing White Ambience family of lights, which includes the A19 bulb, GU10 spot light and BR30 downlight.

* The Fair fixture is available in flushmount, semi-flushmount and suspension styles for attaching to a ceiling.
* Hue smart lights were designed to provide the white light needed to help you wake up and energize, concentrate, read, relax and go to sleep naturally.
* Mark Cieri, Vice President and General Manager for Home Systems with Philips Lighting US, said:
* To put it simply, consumers can have one light to support all of their daily activities. Think about all of the moments you enjoy in your kitchen. Select a cool daylight scene for your morning coffee to energize for the day ahead.
* Help your child focus on their homework with a bright white light. Then, create a cozy ambiance for dinner under a warm light to wind down. With Philips Hue White Ambiance, you can personalize your lighting and truly feel at home.
* Using HomeKit, Siri and the accompanying iOS app, users can create various hues of white light that can be dimmed or brightened throughout the day.
* You can pre-order the new products via the Philips web store ahead of their arrival next month.
* The new $30 candle bulb will be available for pre-order in June and launch in July.
