* PullOver is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you pin an app to your screen for easy access from anywhere in iOS.
* With a minimal UI and animations that look and feel appealing, and flexible configuration to get to any app you need to, PullOver is an elegant new multitasking shortcut any jailbreaker could benefit from.
* PullOver can be opened or closed with a simple Activator action that you get to configure. When you invoke it, you’ll see a small slider at the edge of your screen; invoking the action again hides the slider from view.
* While the slider is on your screen, you can pull on it to bring up a windowed interface of your selected app. In the windowed mode, you can still interact with the app like you normally would, doing things like tapping on buttons and scrolling around.
* Notably, the app doesn’t take the foreground on your device, so when you bring it up, you can easily swipe back out of it and you’ll be right back where you started, whether it’s in another app or your Home screen:

* What’s more is you don’t even have to assign a single favorite app. Instead, you could set up a second Activator action for assigning PullOver to the app you’re already in, so you can use PullOver more dynamically if you wish to do so.
* To configure the tweak, you’ll go to the Settings app after installation and open the PullOver preferences pane:

* Here, you can enable or disable the tweak on demand, customize the appearance of the slider, configure your Activator action, and choose the app you want to pin to PullOver.
* In terms of appearance, you can fiddle with the size of the grabber and change background or arrow color, all of which can help you achieve the aesthetic you’re looking for (particularly important for themers).
* Depending on what you’re doing on your device, there are many multitasking instances where this kind of windowed multitasking view is nice to have.
* One instance where I could see myself using a tweak like this is if I needed to do some quick math. In this case, the pinned app would be my calculator app, and I could easily reveal it to do my math and then hide it to get back to the app I was already in beforehand.
* That example aside, you can configure PullOver in any creative way you can think of, so even if you’re not using it for math, we’re sure you can find a different way to put it to use.
* If you’re interested in giving PullOver a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now. All versions of iOS 9 are supported, but you will need to make sure you have AppList installed as a dependency before you try using the tweak since Cydia doesn’t install it for you automatically.
