* Cable providers can complain all they want about Apple’s “hard-nosed” negotiation tactics when it comes to digital entertainment, but some of them seem to be enjoying unexpected success after introducing over-the-top subscription packages specifically aimed at cord cutters.
* Take as an example CBS and its All Access and Showtime Anytime video-streaming services, which have now surpassed two million subscribers, with user bases evenly split between the two, as revealed by CBS’s CEO on a quarterly results conference call with analysts and investors.
* “CBS All Access and Showtime OTT have surpassed two million subscribers, about evenly split,” Moonves said during the results call on Thursday. “That’s well ahead of where we’d thought we’d be this early in the game.” The subscription revenue from these services has helped the company exceed estimates for its quarterly earnings.

* CBS All Access costs $5.99 per month, and there is no contract so you can cancel any time. It offers a 1-week free trial and is available on the Apple TV, too, so you can try it at no risk. Since debuting in October 2014, it’s remained limited to U.S. viewership.
* Showtime Anytime, CBS’s critically acclaimed premium network, is available across the Apple TV and iOS device, bringing you award-winning series, Hollywood blockbusters and exclusive sports programs in exchange for $10.99 per month.
* Both services are available without a cable or satellite subscription.
* All Access was the first online-only video-subscription service to launch from one of the major networks, followed HBO’s NOW service that released soon after. CBS recently confirmed that All Access subscribers will enjoy the new Star Trek TV series starting in January 2017, after the premiere airs on conventional broadcast channels.
