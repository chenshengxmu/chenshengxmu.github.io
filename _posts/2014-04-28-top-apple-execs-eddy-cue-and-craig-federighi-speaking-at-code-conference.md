* Top Apple executives Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi will headline the second night of Recode’s Code Conference in May, joining an already high profile lineup including General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Hollywood mogul Ryan Seacrest.
* Apple executives rarely make an appearance at events outside of those officially held by Apple, however, Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, formerly of the D Conference, obviously have a secret to doing it. The two have interviewed Apple co-founder Steve Jobs several times, including once alongside Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and most recently interviewed CEO Tim Cook. 
* It should make for an interesting talk, given Cue and Federighi have been some of the most important figures within Apple in recent years. Cue has been at Apple for 25 years and is SVP of Internet Software and Services, reporting to Cook. Federighi is the SVP of Software Engineering, also reporting to Cook.
* An agenda hasn’t been set for the talk, however Recode is promising “to talk about a range of things about the company that remains at the center of the action, especially in the important mobile sector.” Cue and Federighi are certainly the right guys for that, in charge of leading iOS, OS X, and iCloud developments.
* It’s not clear why Cook isn’t also speaking at the event. At any rate, it will give us a sneak peek at Apple’s 2014 thinking ahead of WWDC in early-June.
* The Code Conference is already sold out, taking place on May 27 – May 29.
