* Apple just released iTunes 10.2 which will be required to install iOS 4.3 which will be released next week. Not much has been added to this new version. iTunes 10.2 is needed to allow you to sync your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 4.3.
* iTunes 10.2 also brings improved Home Sharing. It will let you browse and play from your iTunes libraries with Home Sharing on any iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 4.3…
* I download iTunes 10.2 and I can confirm it is safe for jailbreakers and unlockers.
* iTunes 10.2. can be downloaded from Apple’s website.
