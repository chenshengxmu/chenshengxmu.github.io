* In addition to Bluetooth, the Apple Watch also relies on Wi-Fi to communicate with its paired iPhone. In fact, the device can provide a number of useful features over Wi-Fi when iPhone isn’t in Bluetooth range such as Messages, Siri and more.
* It also automatically connects to known Wi-Fi networks that your iPhone, while connected to the Apple Watch over Bluetooth, has connected to before.
* However, the Apple Watch won’t connect to a 5GHz Wi-Fi network, even if its paired iPhone has previously connected to it, as first noted by French blog iGen.fr.
* I own a Time Capsule which supports dual-channel Wi-Fi networking.
* I have set up two wireless networks on the device: one is 5GHz for devices that support fast wireless networking, and the other on the much slower 2.4GHz band for devices like the Apple Watch.
* Then, I made sure to connect at least once to the 2.4GHz network on my iPhone when it was paired with my Apple Watch so that the watch would remember login credentials.

* In addition to 5GHz networks and those your iPhone’s never connected to, the Apple Watch also cannot connect to public networks requiring logins, subscriptions or profiles.
* This is a software limitation because connecting to a password-protected public Wi-Fi without an iPhone at hand would require a software keyboard to input login credentials, which the Watch OS doesn’t support.
* An Apple support document details when the Apple Watch will fall back to Wi-Fi.
* “If Bluetooth isn’t available, Apple Watch will try to use Wi-Fi. For example, if compatible Wi-Fi is available and your iPhone isn’t in Bluetooth range, Apple Watch uses Wi-Fi,” Apple explains.
* When both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are available, your Apple Watch will maintain connection with its paired iPhone over Bluetooth to conserve power.
* “To enjoy every feature on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your paired iPhone,” reads the document.
* To enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your iPhone, just toggle the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switches in the Control Center.
