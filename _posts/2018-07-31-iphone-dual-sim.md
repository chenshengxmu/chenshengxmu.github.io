* The iOS 12 beta 5 update released earlier this week has offered further proof Apple plans on providing a dual-SIM on this year’s so-called iPhone X Plus. This same news was first teased by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in November 2017. The latest details were first discovered by 9to5Mac. 
* With a dual-SIM, users of the larger 2018 iPhone would be able to switch between different carrier plans without having to swap out SIM cards. The feature will likely be most important to European and Asians users, although dual-SIMs are also popular in countries like Nigeria, Brazil, and Egypt too. Usage is uncommon in some of the larger iPhone markets including the United States, Australia, and Canada.
* Of the discovery found in the latest iOS 12 beta, 9to5Mac explains:
* With iOS 12 developer beta 5, we’ve found evidence that dual-SIM support is indeed coming to iPhone, at least at the software level…
* A component of the system responsible for the generation of diagnostic reports includes new references to “second SIM status” and a “second SIM tray status”. Another component references a “dual sim device”. Those references are clearly an indication that iOS is being updated to run in a future device with support for two SIM cards, as seen in the screenshot below. The mention of a “second sim tray” indicates it would in fact have two physical SIM cards instead of a regular one and an e-SIM as the second.
* The newest iOS 12 beta has been full of exciting finds. Earlier today, language was found that seems to confirm calling features are coming to the HomePod smart speaker this fall. The update also includes images of the long-delayed wireless charging case for AirPods.
* Apple’s expected to reveal its 2018 iPhone lineup in September. This year, the company is likely to announce a second-generation 5.8-inch OLED iPhone X, all-new 6.5-inch OLED iPhone X Plus, and 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.
