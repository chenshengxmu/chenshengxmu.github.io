* Apple’s first developer beta of watchOS 4.1 that dropped today brings untethered music streaming to the wrist.
* With watchOS 4.1, owners of the new Series 3 watch can stream Apple Music, Beats 1 radio, other radio stations on Apple Music and even their own matched songs in iCloud Music Library via cellular networks, no iPhone required.
* Don’t worry, these new built-in streaming capabilities are not exclusive to Series 3—they work over Wi-Fi or through a paired iPhone on older watch models just as well.

* So, what do you guys think of the new watchOS 4.1 enhancements?
* Paired with an LTE watch, this makes for some awesome use cases on the go. I mean, we can now summon Siri and ask for any of the 40 million songs on Apple Music to listen to using our AirPods—all wirelessly, all without a phone nearby.
* Some futuristic stuff, eh?
* As usual, sound of in the comments.
