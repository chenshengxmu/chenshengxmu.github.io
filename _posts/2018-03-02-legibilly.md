* One of the primary reasons we jailbreak our devices is to customize how the operating system looks, and a new free jailbreak tweak called LegiBilly by iOS developer i0s_tweak3r holds true to those roots.
* LegiBilly lets you add a splash of color to virtually any label or text color throughout iOS, including what you might find on the Home screen, Lock screen, and Status Bar, among others.
* In the screenshot examples shown above, you can discern precisely how LegiBilly works. You’ll notice custom colors taking over various aspects of the Home screen and Spotlight page, which have all been implemented by the tweak. These include app icon labels, headers, search bar text, and more.
* LegiBilly adds a lengthy preference pane to the Settings app where you can set up your custom colors and options to your liking:

* Among the things you can configure here are:
* The options are quite extensive and can give your iPhone or iPad an entirely new look. Worthy of note, the tweak uses a color picker for configuration, which provides you with a limitless selection to choose from. That said, you don’t need to rely on a pre-set list of colors and can pick anything in between standard colors if you wanted.
* For what it is, LegiBilly seems to be a great way to give your jailbroken iPhone or iPad a fresh new look and feel. Admittedly, not everyone is into aesthetic customizations, but it should meet the needs of those who are.
* You can download LegiBilly for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository, and it works on all jailbroken devices running iOS 7-11.
