* Yesterday we reported that Apple had released iOS 4.4.1 for the Apple TV. Unfortunately, minutes after pushing the update, many users reported that the new software was actually “bricking” their device, which let Apple to pull the plug and stop the release of 4.4.1.
* It seems that Apple has fixed the issue and has started pushing iOS 4.4.1 for Apple TV again late last night…
* You can now safely update your Apple TV to iOS 4.4.1 via the Software Update menu of your Apple TV.
