* GN ReSound, a company that’s been working with Apple to take the stigma out of wearing an aid, today formally launched the world’s first ‘Made for iPhone’ hearing aid, the LiNX. The accessory is designed for the hearing impaired users and offers direct streaming of sound from the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, without the need for an additional remote control, accessory or pendant.
* It marries power-efficient Bluetooth Smart to third-generation 2.4 GHz wireless networking based on the all-new SmartRange chipset while offering some advanced features. Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* The LiNX can be used to talk on the phone and listen to music, with a custom app offering features like adjusting volume levels, changing accessory settings, using geofencing to assign and adjust to the acoustics of frequently visited places like home, work, favorite restaurants and more, as per ReSound’s media release.

* Despite its small footprint – the LiNX files as the smallest wireless receiver-in-the-ear hearing aid – it can address 90 percent of all hearing losses, the company said.

* According to Reuters, there’s a good reason to use the 2.4GHz band:
* Apple went to all manufacturers and said it wanted to have a direct link from hearing aids to its phones using 2.4 GHz and, because GN was already on its second generation of such products, an instant pairing was made. Frequent visits followed between California and Copenhagen to build up the protocol and improve power-efficiency.
* That it helps take the stigma out of wearing an aid by eliminating the need for a separate transmitter, which is typically worn round the neck, is a nice bonus.

* A ‘Find My Hearing Aid’ function should come to the rescue when your accessory gets misplaced or lost. The LiNX will be available through a global network of hearing care professionals and via Beltone First, the sister brand of ReSound.
