title: FastFeed for Tumblr makes multi-tab reading a snap for your Tumblr feed
---
* Do you Tumblr? A 16-year-old asked me that once. I guess Tumblr is the new Blogger. Since the social networking post-making site is growing in popularity, it is no wonder that app makers are starting to pay attention to it.

* FastFeed for Tumblr is a Tumblr client that lets you view your feed with a multi-tap experience so that you can navigate faster and easier and keep the flow going…
* The biggest feature of this app is its multi-tab web browsing capability. Instead of tapping on a Tumblr post and then having to hit the back button every time you want to go back to your dashboard, this app creates new tabs every time you select a link or visit a page or go to another Tumblr feed.
* Every new feed you visit will create a new tab. However, the multi-tab bar is smart. If you already have a feed in the bar, you won’t get a double tab of the same feed. It will simply redirect you to the existing tab.
* The multi-tab bar is easily hidden out of view when you don’t need it. When you scroll down to view a feed, the tab bar will disappear. To call it back up, tap the tiny arrows at the bottom right side of the screen.

* The multi-tab bar also lets you follow or unfollow a Tumblr feed, close the current tab, close all other tabs, and see your browsing history. If you want to discover new Tumblr feeds, tap the search icon to call up featured tags. You can find feeds dedicated to animals, crafts, music, and more. View information regarding your own Tumblr feed in the menu section on the left side of the screen. When you call up the menu screen, you can view posts that you’ve “liked,” see which feeds you are following and view your personal Tumblr posts.

* You can also create new posts with this app. You can upload photos, videos, quotes, chats, links, and text with just a few simple taps. You can also “Like,” repost, or share other Tumblr posts. You can easily share a link to a funny GIF on Tumblr through Facebook, Twitter, email, or text message.
* FastFeed for Tumblr is available for the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch for free. Download it in the App Store today.
