* If you’ve got nostalgia for older skeuomorphic versions of iOS, or you’re just looking for a different look and feel for your device altogether, then a new jailbreak tweak called ClassicFolders 2 just might tickle your fancy.
* This tweak gives your folders a throwback to the days of iOS 6 and earlier by giving them a page break-style instead of the full-screen effect that’s been around since iOS 7.
* Shown above, the tweak makes a stark change to your folders right out of the box. The new look and feel is designed to be reminiscent of the iOS 6 days, all while giving you the option of keeping a modern look and feel.
* Of course, if you don’t want a modern look and feel, rather your nostalgia gets the best of you and you want your folders to look how they did in iOS 6 and earlier, then you might opt to apply one of the bundled themes rather than the default settings:

* From left to right in the examples above, you’re seeing: iOS 6 theme, Mavericks theme, and iOS 4 theme. Since everyone has their own opinions, having the selection above is nice for those who prefer one style over another.
* ClassicFolders 2 puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Among the things you can do here are:
* Most of the settings take effect immediately after choosing them, but if you use the classic icon setting, you need to respring your device for it to be saved. Fortunately, there’s a respring button at the bottom of the pane for your convenience.
* Going back in time to an era when iOS looked completely different won’t be everyone’s forte, but the nice thing is that ClassicFolders 2 has tons of options. Even if you don’t want your iPhone to look like it just came out of the digital stone age, you can opt for the modern-looking folder with the older page break style of yore.
* We did notice the tweak causes a cringe-worthy lag when flipping through Home screen pages. This is an aesthetic bug rather than a critical one and perhaps it will be fixed in a future update; nevertheless it’s worth noting because it might be enough to turn some users away at first sight.
* If you’re interested in giving ClassicFolders 2 a try, you can download it for $1.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
