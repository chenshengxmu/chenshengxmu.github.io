* Twitter, a 140-character messaging service and a social platform, today said that it’s supersizing photos in mobile apps for the iPhone and Android.
* Bigger photos should make browsing profiles on Twitter for iPhone “even more fun” while allowing for more visual impact, according to a tweet issued Wednesday.
* The visual types are going to have a field day seeing full-bleed images in their timeline. Suffice it to say, this is a cool improvement compared to small thumbnails that needed to be tapped on to enlarge.
* Twitter for iPhone and iPad is available free in the App Store.
* Twitter isn’t  saying whether this is just a backend update or if an app refresh will be necessary. At the time of this writing, the company was yet to issue an accompanying blog post.
* The iPhone client had not been updated at post time, but this is likely due to the App Store and other iTunes/iCloud services experiencing widespread outage. If I were a betting man, I’d say it’s a silent backend update so no app refresh should be needed.
* Be that as it may, revamped profile pages and more prominent images debuted on twitter.com in April 2014 and now bigger photos are finally available on the iPhone, just 24 hours after the micro-blogging startup announced an updated Android app with a new profile layout sporting bigger photos, bios and more.
* We're rolling out new profiles on Twitter for Android: it's now easier to view bios, Tweets and photos.https://t.co/MMnvuuHaxh

* Back in January, Twitter implemented native sharing of 30-second videos that you can embed in your own blog posts and on websites. Having dipped its toes into video sharing, the company has now reportedly set its sights on live video streaming.

* Monday, The Wall Street Journal said Twitter had quietly purchased the live video streaming app Periscope, paying a reported $100 million for the software, which is still in beta testing and has not been released for public consumption.
* News of Twitter’s deal with Periscope arrived just as another live video streaming app started blowing up. Meerkat, which our own Lory Gil reviewed yesterday, lets Twitter users display live video from their phones.
* In the eight days since the free app launched on the App Store, Meerkat has managed to attract 60,000 users, according to founder Ben Rubin.
