* It was just a little over a year ago that FiftyThree launched Paper for the iPad. But during its short existence, the sketch app has amassed quite a few accomplishments, including winning an Apple Design award.
* Last night, Paper received its first major update since its original debut. And the release, which brings the app to version 1.3.1, offers a few improvements, including the highly-requested pinch-to-zoom feature…
* Here’s the full change log:
* EXPLORE. SEE WHAT THE WORLD IS MAKING.
* • MADE WITH PAPER—Find inspiration in this feed of fresh ideas from creative minds around the world. • ZOOM—Get closer to your ideas. Pinch to bring up zoom without losing your place. • INK UPGRADE―Our Expressive Ink Engine™ is now built on OpenGL for faster rendering.
* The new zoom feature is particularly cool. Where most apps will zoom in on an entire page with the pinch gesture, Paper’s zoom focuses in on just a small circle of content, allowing you to examine details in context.
* I also really like the new ‘Made with Paper’ stream. Like the Tumblr of the same name, it showcases some of the cool stuff people have made using Paper. The gallery is located next to all of your notebooks inside the app.
* If you haven’t played with Paper by FiftyThree yet, I recommend it. The UI is gorgeous, and its utensils almost seem to make you a better artist. You can find it in the App Store for free, with a handful of in-app purchases.
