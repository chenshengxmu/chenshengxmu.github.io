* If you regularly use the emoji keyboard on iOS, then you’ve no doubt experienced the issue that causes your keyboard to revert to another input method.
* This problem generally arrises when doing one of two things: after tapping send in a chat app like the Messages app, and on first keyboard activation when the current input mode is emoji.
* If you’re unfamiliar with the issue, it’s a little difficult to describe without actually showing you. Check out our video demonstrations, which shows you how LockEmoji—a free new jailbreak tweak released on Cydia—tackles this issue.

* After installing LockEmoji, there are no options or settings to configure or wrangle with. You should notice the effects of LockEmoji immediately.
* For example, try launching the Message app, and switch to the Emoji keyboard. Now, close the Messages app, reopen it, and watch what happens to the keyboard.
* You’ll notice that the keyboard stays locked on the Emoji keyboard, and doesn’t revert to another input method. Without LockEmoji, as demonstrated in the Vine video above, this doesn’t happen.

* I think this before and after comparison aptly showcases why LockEmoji is beneficial to heavy users of the Emoji keyboard on iOS 8.
* What do you think? Do you value this tweak?
