* Handoff is one of the flagship features for both iOS and OS X. It allows you to seamlessly continue working where you left off on another device.
* In this video tutorial, I’ll walk you through making sure that Handoff is enabled for your device, and show you how it can be used. Step inside to learn more.
* To use Handoff, both your Mac and iOS devices should be connected to the same iCloud account and have Bluetooth on. You’ll also need to enable Handoff in System Preferences → General on the Mac, and Settings → General → Handoff & Suggested Apps on iOS.
* Open a supported app on your iOS device, such as Safari, Mail, or Messages, and you should see the Handoff app appear to the left of the Finder app in your Mac’s Dock. Click the Handoff app to launch the app on your Mac and pick up where you left off.
* To pick up Mac apps from your iOS device, open the iOS App Switcher, and swipe to the left-most card. You can also access Handoff apps from the iOS Lock Screen.
