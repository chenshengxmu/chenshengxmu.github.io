* Those who have tried Apple Pay can attest that paying with your iPhone couldn’t be simpler. You just hold your device near the contactless reader with your finger on Touch ID to pay for the goods or services you bought.
* But wouldn’t it be great if you could choose any provisioned card from your Apple Pay account on the Lock screen, without having to unlock your iPhone?
* You can now make your purchases by double-clicking the Home button to access Wallet without unlocking your iPhone, a feature partially borrowed from the Apple Watch. You then simply choose a card and authenticate your purchase via Touch ID.
* Here’s how you can enable Wallet access right from the iPhone’s Lock screen with just a few taps.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 9.
* Step 2: Tap on Wallet & Apple Pay.
* Step 3: Toggle the Double-Click Home Button switch to enable or disable this feature (it’s on by default).

* “Get cards or passes ready from the Lock screen by double-clicking the Home button,” reads the feature’s description.
* Step 4: You will also need to enable Wallet access from the Lock screen: go to Settings → Touch ID & Passcode, punch in your device passcode and flip the Wallet switch in the Allow Access When Lock subsection to the ON position.

* That’s it, you can now access Apple Pay without unlocking your iPhone and access your non-default credit, debit and loyalty cards in Wallet at checkout, without unlocking the device and opening the Wallet app.
* Summing up, having direct access to Wallet from the Lock screen lets you prepare an upcoming payment even faster:
* If you disable Wallet access on the Lock screen, you can still make purchases with Apple Pay but you won’t be able to choose your default card at checkout unless you change it within the Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay section.

* iOS 9 ditched the old Passbook app and replaces it with the all-new Wallet program. Wallet does everything Passbook was capable of, and then some more.
* In addition to storing boarding passes, tickets, rewards cards and other Passbook items, Wallets also stores your credit cards, debit cards and store credit cards, and keeps track of the most recent Apple Pay purchase for your convenience.
* If you’re adding the credit or debit card to Wallet that’s already tied to your iTunes account, you will only need to enter the card security code. To add more cards to your Wallet, open Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay, tap the plus sign (or “Add Credit or Debit Card”) and follow the onscreen instructions.
* Apple has promised customers will soon be able to use store credit cards, like Kohl’s Charge or JCPenney Credit Card, and add rewards cards, such a Dunkin’ Donuts DD Perks, Walgreens Balance Rewards and MyPanera, to the Wallet app and receive and redeem rewards when using Apple Pay.
