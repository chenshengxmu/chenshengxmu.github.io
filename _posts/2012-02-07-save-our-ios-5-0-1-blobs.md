* Are you enjoying your newly jailbroken devices as much as we are? If so, you may want to make sure that you have saved your iOS 5.0.1 SHSH blobs. If not, you could risk losing the ability to jailbreak in the future.
* It’s been over a month since Apple released iOS 5.1 beta 3, so it wouldn’t surprise us to see a public release sometime in the near future. And from what we’ve heard, the new software will patch the Corona exploit…
* TinyUmbrella developer, notcom, just posted this brief message on his blog:
* “With the quiet time between jailbreak and iOS version, make sure you get your SHSHs saved. I’ve been working on the TinyUmbrella rewrite (albeit sparingly due to real life demands). It’s important to make sure you have your 5.0.1 SHSHs tucked away safe. There is no guarantee that we’ll have things this good again.”
* Although Cydia can store your SHSH blobs, we recommend using a utility like iFaith or TinyUmbrella as well. If you’re not sure how to use these applications, we have step-by-step tutorials and other resources on our Downgrade page.
* Any questions?
