* Over the course of the years, iOS has brought out some important keyboard enhancements aimed at boosting your typing efficiency and productivity on iPads. In addition, the look and feel of the keyboard has been refreshed with a new typeface and lowercase keys commonly found on Android keyboards.
* Lowercase keys not only affect Apple’s stock QuickType keyboard, but other keyboards that use a Shift key to switch between uppercase and lowercase letters. Should you, for any reason, dislike lowercase keys and would like to switch back to all-uppercase design, you can do so easily with just a few taps.
* Step 1: Open the Settings app on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* Step 1: Navigate to the General > Accessibility > Keyboard section.
* Step 1: Now flip the switch next to Show Lowercase Keys to the OFF position.

* ”This affects keyboards that use a Shift key to switch between uppercase and lowercase letters,” reads the feature’s description.
* When this is turned off, letters on the keyboard will be uppercase regardless of whether the Shift or Caps Lock keys are active. With Show Lowercase Keys enabled, letters on the keyboard will be lowercase until you press the Shift or Caps Lock key, at which point the keyboard switches from uppercase to lowercase keys.
* I find this behavior more logical because it makes it that much easier to distinguish between the two states of iOS’s incredibly confusing Shift key.
* If you find the pre-iOS 9 uppercase keyboard look distracting, you can always switch back to the new lowercase keys by toggling Show Lowercase Keys on in Settings.
