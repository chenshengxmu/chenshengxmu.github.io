* If you’re a jailbreaker, then you realize how important OpenSSH is to the jailbreak community and you likely use it often.
* But if you’re new to the world of jailbreaking, you might not see the benefit right off hand.
* This video tutorial not only shows you how to install OpenSSH onto your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, but why it’s beneficial as well…
* As you can discern from the video, the main benefit to OpenSSH is to be able to transfer files to and fro on your iOS device.
* This is nice in itself, but it also opens up a wealth of other possibilities. Stay tuned for future tutorials that will use the file transfer capabilities that OpenSSH brings into play.
* Are you an OpenSSH user?
