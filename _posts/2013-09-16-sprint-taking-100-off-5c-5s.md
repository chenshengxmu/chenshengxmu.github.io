* With both new iPhones coming to Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile this week, expect to see providers put in a little extra effort to lure in new customers. After all, this is the first time ever that Apple’s popular handset will launch on all 4 major US carriers.
* Sprint, for example, announced today that it will be offering a $100 instant credit to folks porting in their number to their network from another carrier. And that credit can be used toward the purchase price of the iPhone 5c or 5s, essentially knocking $100 off…
* From Sprint’s website (via 9to5Mac):
* “Get up to $100 off any phone when you bring your number to Sprint. Save up to $100 on any phone when you switch your number to Sprint. That’s right, save an extra $100 on your favorite devices. Close this window to start shopping. All prices reflect the Bring Your Number Savings. Upgrades are not eligible for Bring Your Number Savings. The final price of your phone will be reflected on the device details page and in your cart.”
* Keep in mind that this offer does require you to port in an existing, active cell or landline number from another provider, and it can’t be a Sprint entity, like Boost Mobile. You’ll also have to sign a two-year contract with Sprint and pay a $36 activation fee per line.
* Still, for those that qualify, the deal can mean big savings on the new iPhone models. For instance, instead of paying $99 for the 16GB iPhone 5c, you could get one for free. Or you could pay just $99 for the entry-level iPhone 5s model and $199 for the 32GB.
* As we reported earlier, Sprint, along with several other carriers and retailers, will be opening at 8am on Friday morning to start selling the new iPhones. But if you’d rather not wait in line, Apple is taking 5c pre-orders right now and will start taking 5s orders Friday.
