* Right as the United States retailing giant Target announced a significant sale by taking a cool $100 off of the original iPad mini’s $299 price tag, rival Best Buy is mirroring the deal now in the run-up to Father’s Day.
* That’s right, you can now pick up an entry-level Wi-Fi-only iPad mini with sixteen gigabytes of storage for just $199 versus Apple’s asking price of $299. LTE variants have been discount, too. The deal is available in select retail locations and does not extend to Best Buy’s online store…
* If you’re planning on buying an LTE-capable iPad mini model (Verizon or AT&T only), Best Buy is offering an even deeper discount of $130 (regular price: $429).
* Here are the links:
* • $199 16GB Wi-Fi iPad mini, White/Silver • $199 16GB Wi-Fi iPad mini, Space Gray • $299 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad mini, White/Silver, Verizon • $299 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad mini, White/Silver (AT&T)
* For what it’s worth, these are by far the lowest price we’ve ever seen so we therefore expect this inventory to run out quickly.
* After introducing the $399 iPad mini with Retina display last Fall, the original iPad mini was slashed from its original November 2012 $329 price point down to $299.
* What do you think of Target’s and Best Buy’s respective promotion? Does a $199 iPad mini sound tempting to you?
