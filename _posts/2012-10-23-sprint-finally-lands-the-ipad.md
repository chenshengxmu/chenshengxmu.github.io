* Apple made a number of big announcements at its media event this morning, including some new computers, and of course the iPad mini. But one revelation that seems to have flown under the radar is a new carrier deal.
* Sprint is now (finally) an official iPad partner. The company just pushed out a press release a few moments ago stating that in the coming weeks, it will be offering LTE versions of the 4th gen iPad, and the iPad mini…
* From the presser:
* “OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (BUSINESS WIRE), October 23, 2012 – Sprint (NYSE: S) today announced that in the coming weeks it will offer iPad mini and fourth generation iPad. Sprint will offer these new iPads with a range of attractive data plans that will allow customers to connect to its 4G LTE network.”
* The new partnership comes just three months after Sprint launched its LTE network. The carrier’s updated 4G network is currently only in about 15 markets, but it plans to add it to hundreds of cities in the coming months.
* The timing is also interesting as Sprint has just been recently acquired, on paper, by Japan’s Softbank, and consequently is looking to take control over its wireless broadband partner Clearwire. Obviously, all parties concerned will be pleased with the tablet deal.
* Apple unveiled the fourth generation iPad and new iPad mini at a media event in San Jose, California this morning.  And for more information on both of those tablets, you can click here (for iPad 4) and here (for the iPad mini).
