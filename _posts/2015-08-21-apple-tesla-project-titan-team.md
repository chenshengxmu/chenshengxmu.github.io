* Apple has hired a senior engineer from electric car maker Tesla Motors, according to a new report from Reuters. The outlet points to the LinkedIn profile of former Tesla Autopilot Firmware Manager Jamie Carlson, who now works at Apple on “Special Projects.”
* Carlson’s profile doesn’t go into details regarding his previous position, but the fact that he worked in the autonomous firmware division of one of the industry’s most technologically advanced companies, is fueling speculation that Apple is building an electric car.

* In addition to Carlson, Reuters mentions other previously unknown Apple hires from the automotive space. There is Megan McClain, a former engineer at VW, graduate researcher Vinay Palakkode, and Xianqiao Tong, who worked on driver systems at NVIDIA.
* The report is just the latest in a stack of mounting evidence that Apple is working on a car. It’s believed the company has a team of more than 200 employees toiling away on an electric vehicle in a secret Sunnyvale, California lab, under the codename Project Titan.
* Earlier this month, The Guardian obtained documents showing Apple’s interest in touring a test track for autonomous vehicles. And we’ve heard multiple reports that Apple executives have recently traveled to BMW’s Leipzig factory, where it produces the electric i3.
