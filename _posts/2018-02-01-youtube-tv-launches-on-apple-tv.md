* As promised earlier today, Google’s over-the-top video streaming app YouTube TV is now available on your fourth-generation Apple TV and Apple TV 4K.
* Perviously, customers who were using YouTube TV for iPhone and iPad could only stream live television from this app through Apple’s AirPlay feature.
* Available with a $35 per month subscription, YouTube TV brings more than 40 US broadcast channels, including local sports and news networks, to your set-top box—just in time for the big game, the Winter Olympics, the Oscars and everything else.
* Supported features include unlimited cloud-based DVR functionality, personalized recommendations, a full grid-style program guide, the ability to watch live TV while browsing the program guide and more.
* Cloud DVR comes with storage limits: each recording will be stored in the cloud for 9 months.
* Hey @AppleTV users, check the app store.

* Here are some of the channels and locals included in the subscription package: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, AMC, ESPN, the Disney Channel, Fox News and Bravo. You can get Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus add-ons for an extra fee, as well as access YouTube Red content.
* Google also brought YouTube TV to Roku hardware earlier today.
* The app is available as a single download covering iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. If you already have YouTube TV installed on your iOS device, find it in tvOS App Store → Purchased → Not on This Apple TV, or ask Siri to “Download YouTube TV from App Store”.
* It’s good to have options and YouTube TV gives you yet another alternative to traditional cable television. YouTube TV is available in more than 80 markets nationwide, covering 80 percent of the US population. For the complete list, see tv.youtube.com/tv/availability.
* Like its competitors, YouTube TV offers a free trial for new subscribers.
* PSA: If you sign up for the 14-day free trial now, you’re good for the “Big Game” and about half of the Olympics before they start charging. Pay the first month’s $35 and you get all of the Olympics (ends Feb 25) and the Oscars (Mar 4). https://t.co/dFXyHtFeCl

* You can have six accounts per household, each with its own login, recommendations and DVR functionality. There are no commitments: you can cancel the service anytime you want.
* The app requires iOS 9.1 or later.
* YouTube TV is a free download from App Store.
