* US carrier T-Mobile wants you to know that it’s landed iPhone X so they’ve created a pretty awesome ad for the latest Apple smartphone featuring—why not?—Animoji.
* The 30-second commercial features a dude who sends iMessages to his girlfriend with custom Animoji recordings before realizing he was messaging a group chat.
* It’s a pretty funny ad, give it a quick watch right below.
* Song: “Can’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe” by Barry White
* They’ve even made a Spanish version of the video, which carriers often do for the US market.
* With Animoji, you can use the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone X to create and share custom characters that use your voice and mirror your facial expressions. Anyone using an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.0 or later can receive iMessages with Animoji in them.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* However, you do need an iPhone X to create Animoji.
* How do you like this T-Mobile ad?

* Hat tip to The Loop’s Dave Mark for bringing this to our attention
