* Aside from a video showing the Face ID setup process on an iPhone X, another seemingly Apple-sanctioned clip popped up on YouTube last weekend documenting device unboxing.
* Mexican YouTube channel Gotcha yesterday shared an iPhone X unboxing video, shown below.
* My Spanish is a little rusty these days, but the poster is probably involved with Apple because the device itself appears to be for an Apple Store kiosk display, as evidenced by the presence of the dedicated Face ID demo app on the Home screen and the looping animation.
* Aside from the phone itself, the white box it arrives in includes your Lightning-enabled EarPods, a Lightning to USB cable, a 5W USB wall adapter, a Lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter and some printed material laying out the basics of Face ID and new gestures.
* Apple began taking pre-orders for iPhone X last Friday.
* The device is scheduled to hit store shelves this coming Friday, November 3.
