* In addition to Apple Watch talk, Jeff Williams made some other interesting comments at the Code Conference on Wednesday. During his interview with Recode, Apple’s SVP of Operations seemingly confirmed the company’s rumored interest in cars.
* “The car is the ultimate mobile device,” Williams nonchalantly noted, in response to a question regarding what the Cupertino firm will do with its staggering cash hoard beyond returning money to investors. “We are exploring a lot of different markets.”
* Williams’ remark will likely rekindle talk of an Apple-branded electric car. Earlier this year, major news outlets, including Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, reported the iPad-maker was a year into a top-secret car project, aiming for a 2020 launch.
* But just because it’s working on a car, doesn’t mean we’ll ever see it. The company is said to have recently shelved a decade-long TV project. Williams said Apple chooses new businesses based on whether or not it thinks it can “make a huge amount of difference.”
* For now, though, Apple seems content with working alongside current car-makers on features like Siri Eyes Free and CarPlay. Launched last Spring, CarPlay allows users to pair their iPhones with compatible vehicles and head units for convenient in-car use.
