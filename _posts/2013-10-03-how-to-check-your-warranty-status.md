* When new operating systems and devices come out, it starts to get our brains-a-whirling about warranties, tech support, and consumer protections against faulty equipment.
* If you can’t remember the exact date that you purchased your iPhone, or don’t recall whether you added AppleCare for the extended warranty on your iPad, or Mac, there is an easy way to find out the warranty status of your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and more without having to dig through that shoebox of old receipts.
* Checking the status of your warranty is surprisingly simple. All you need is the device’s serial number or IMEI and a link to the warranty agreement search. I’ll get to that in a minute. First, let’s talk serial numbers and IMEI. Do you know where yours is? If not, don’t worry. There are a number of ways to find it.
* Note that by following the directions below, you can find out about warranty and support status for all your Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and Mac.
* Once you know your device’s serial number or IMEI, you can find out if you are still covered under Apple’s warranty.
* Step 1: Visit Apple’s warranty check page.
* Step 2: Enter your device’s serial number or IMEI. Also enter the captcha code.
* Step 3: Click “Continue.”

* You will then be directed to your device’s current service and support coverage, including the validity of your purchase date, eligibility for telephone support status and its estimated expiration date, and eligibility for repairs and service coverage and their estimated expiration date.
* Now you know how to quickly check your warranty information on your iOS device or your Mac. If you want to upgrade to AppleCare before it is too late, maybe you should check your status today.
* Have you used Apple’s technical support for any of your devices? How was your experience?
