* On Thursday, the Unicode Consortium added three characters to its list of 2019 emoji candidates. New characters now being considered for Unicode 12 include a service dog, mixed-race couple, and deaf people.
* In announcing the additions, Unicode president Mark Davis explains::
* Leading up to July, we’d already decided on the bulk of the candidates for 2019. We had a special focus on accessibility, and were working out how to do a last few accessibility emoji and how to handle mixed-skin-tone groups. In July, we further solidified the draft specification for Emoji 12.0, and added to the candidate list two new accessibility emoji and the 55 mixed-skin-tone couples.
* First teased in June, the candidates for 2019 also include a sloth, onion, beverage box, yo-yo, and more. 
* The final Emoji Version 12.0 list is planned for release in March 2019. Until then, the announced characters are only candidates, and subject to change.
* Among the other new emojis possibly coming next year are:
* Flamingo and White Heart are two of the emojis most requested by Emojipedia users in 2018. Both are shortlisted for the 2019 release of Emoji 12.0.
* Draft candidates for 2019 also include a diving mask, ax, waffle, Diya lamp and a Hindu temple.
* Unicode 11.0 launched and June is part of the upcoming iOS 12 and macOS Mojave releases. Among the 62 new emoji released this year are a softball, kangaroo, llama, partying face, parrot, lobster, and others.
