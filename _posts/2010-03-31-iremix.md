title: iRemix Considerably Improves Your iPod App
---
* Do you feel that the features of the iPod app of your iPhone or iTouch are limited? You’re not alone. The other day as I was miserably stuck in a bus between Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in Vietnam, I was playing with my iPod and building an on-the-go playlist. I found it absolutely ridiculous that I couldn’t add songs to the on-the-go playlist while playing the songs.

* After doing a bit of research online (all this over the amazing Vietnamese 3G), I came across iRemix, a jailbreak app that aims at enhancing your iPod experience. iRemix is more a mod than an app per say. It integrates seamlessly with your iPod app, making it much better.
* I was excited about iRemix because it was supposedly able to do what I wanted: easily add songs being played to the on-the-go playlist. But it also has other badass features:
* In the first image below, you can see the bookmarking feature, the “i” for information search, and the FFW/REW feature. Note that I added all of them for this screenshot but the screen doesn’t normally look so busy. In the second image, you can see the “add to on-the-go” and “add to favorites” features.

* These sounds like very simple features, don’t they? Well, they are very basic but very powerful. So powerful that I suspect we will see some of them in iPhone OS 4.0.
* iRemix is available from Cydia for $2.99 and comes with a 5-day trial period. This app is a no brainer for anyone looking to make enhance the iPod feature.
* You might have already heard or even tried iRemix since it’s not so new. If so, what do you think about this app?
