* A major redesign of Skype’s desktop app, previewed in mid-August, is rolling out today.
* According to Microsoft, Skype for Mac includes themes with customizable colors, the ability to organize your chats by time, unread or status, pin people or groups, standard/compact view, cloud-based media sharing (up to 300 MB per file) and cross-device functionality.
* From the Skype blog:
* With the new Skype, you can get more done on your PC. We know that changing devices interrupts your flow—no one wants to switch from their computer to their phone just to have a better conversation experience. Now you can send and receive Skype messages in real-time, answer calls directly from your PC and share your screen to present your latest ideas to colleagues.
* Other features in this release include reactions for messages and video calls, @mentions, status updates (with mood messages), chat bots and more.

* Desktop Skype now includes a bell icon that you can click to reveal an all-new notification panel (this is where you’ll also see reactions to your messages, @mentions in group conversations or if someone quoted you). With a new chat media gallery, all your shared content like media, links and files is available in one central place, and you can even sort items by type.
* Lastly, Microsoft announced that Skype add-ins are now available now to Skype Insiders.

* “It’s now easier than ever to complete everyday tasks in Skype. From sending a Giphy, scheduling an event or sending money to pulling up the latest in the news—our add-ins help you get more done within Skype,” notes the firm.
* The Windows maker revamped its mobile Skype apps for iPhone and iPad in June 2017 which, among other enhancements, brought a Snapchat-like Highlights feature that allows users to share auto-vanishing photos and videos that can be decorated with emoji and text.
* Highlights is not part of today’s update to the desktop app.
* Skype for Mac can be downloaded from skype.com/download.
