* Apple late Wednesday night posted a new commercial to its YouTube channel titled “Explore the All-New Apple Music.” The ad showcases the company’s revamped streaming music service, spotlighting several of its features.
* It works essentially as an overview of the iOS 10 Music app, demonstrating how you can build your own personal music library based on custom recommendations and new content discovered via Apple’s Beats 1 Radio station.
* Apple Music is $4.99/month for students, $9.99/month for non-student individuals and $14.99/month for families up to 6. During its September iPhone 7 event, Apple announced that the service had surpassed 17 million paid users.
* It also offers a 3-month free trial. Check it out here.
