* The mobile version has several improvements over the original game, like the ability to save your progress at any point in the game and compete with the world for high scores.
* The second game in the Sonic franchise, Sega says this re-release represents the most complete version of the game to date, complete with widescreen support, silky-smooth action at 60 frames per second and a completely remastered soundtrack.
