* The nation’s second-largest carrier, AT&T, said on Friday that it will be increasing monthly data allotments for two of its Mobile Share Value plans.
* Beginning Sunday, November 2, Mobile Share Value customers will get three gigabytes of high-speed 4G LTE data for $40 a month instead of two gigabytes.
* In addition, customers on a pricer tier will be treated  to six gigabytes for $70 a month instead of four gigabytes like before.
* Furthermore, all Mobile Share Value plans now get unlimited international messaging for text, picture and video for no additional cost.
* International messaging includes messages sent from the United States, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands to more than 190 countries for text messages and 120 countries for picture and video messages.
* Here’s AT&T’s price comparison chart.

* Keep in mind that pricing excludes device access charges.
* The promotion includes both family and business plans and requires an additional device access fee of $25 per month for each line of service.
* As a nice bonus, the carrier is extending its double data deal on Mobile Share Value plans ranging from 15GB to 50GB until November 15, 2014.
* As we previously explained, this offer gives Mobile Share Value subscribers 30/40/60/80/100GB of LTE data on their smartphone or tablet instead of the 15/20/30/40/50GB buckets, for the same $130/$160/$225/$300/$375 monthly fee.
* Other carriers have followed AT&T’s example by announcing similar double data deals of their own, including the #1 U.S. carrier Verizon and Sprint, the nation’s #3 mobile operator.
