* T-Mobile is holding a media event later today at 2:30PM Eastern / 11:30AM Pacific to announce “our boldest moves yet.” A leaked memo suggests the Deutsche Telekom-owned telco is readying a new unlimited upgrade plan for smartphones. “We’ve upgraded upgrades,” the memo reads. Called Jump, the idea is to allow customers to upgrade when they actually want to instead of waiting the usual two-years until their contract expires. I’ve included more tidbits after the break…
* “Don’t pay more than new customers. Seriously “ reads one bullet point.
* “No annual service contracts. No overages. No brainer,” another one has it.
* I’ll be looking forward to hearing T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere curse during today’s press conference.
* If John Legere doesn’t come on stage with his pants on backwards today, then life has no meaning. Also, too soon? RIP Chris Kelly

* The memo, obtained by The Verge, can be seen top of post.
* TmoNews yesterday speculated Jump would require a “very small” membership fee and that T-Mobile would ask customers to trade-in their existing handset in order to qualify.
* In exchange for this fee, customers would receive insurance on their device as well as the two annual upgrades. The idea of this club is just one of many opportunities T-Mobile’s CEO is considering with their new UNcarrier model.
* Jump could fly in the face of AT&T and Verizon as both carriers recently killed early device upgrades, pushing the waiting period back to 24 months.
* What’s your take?
* Is Jump going to make a difference in the greater scheme of things?
