* Apple today released AirPods software 3.7.2, bringing unspecified improvements and bug fixes to the company’s first Bluetooth earbuds featuring the in-house designed W1 wireless chip.
* According to the German-language publication Macerkopf.de (Google Translate), which first spotted the new firmware, it’s possible that it addresses the reported Bluetooth connectivity issues where AirPods would lost connection with their paired iPhone during phone calls.
* To install the new AirPods firmware, put both earbuds inside their charging case, then close the case and connect it to a charger or a USB port on your computer. Your iPhone must be paired with your AirPods and connected to Wi-Fi in order for the firmware to download and install.
