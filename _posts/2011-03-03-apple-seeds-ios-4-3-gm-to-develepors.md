* Apple has seeded the iOS 4.3 Golden Master to develepors. This timely release paves the way for 4.3’s public release next Friday.
* Whenever a GM version of iOS is released, it means that it is nearly ready for deployment. This version of iOS will be made available for all iDevices, except for the CDMA iPhone 4.
* Next Friday’s release of iOS 4.3 will only be available for the GSM (AT&T) iPhone. The Verizon iPhone runs on a different baseband, and requires its own update that Apple will hopefully push out soon.
* As is the case will all developer builds, this 4.3 GM is intended for registered Apple develepors only. iOS 4.3 brings updates to AirPlay, and also adds Personal Hotspot functionality to the AT&T iPhone.
* Don’t touch 4.3 yet if you jailbreak. There is currently no working jailbreak for iOS 4.3, but we’ll keep you posted on when one becomes available.
