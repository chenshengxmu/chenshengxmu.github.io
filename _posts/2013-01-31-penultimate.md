title: Evernote's Penultimate handwriting app goes free, Hello gains business card scanning
---
* Acquired last year, Evernote’s Penultimate iPad app helps you jot down notes and draw sketches using your finger. It’s like having a Galaxy Note just without, you know, a pen. Penultimate 4.0 was launched this morning and Evernote kindly decided to offer it free of charge (it used to be a paid download). It’s tightly integrated with Evernote and your handwritten notes now sync fully via the cloud with your other Evernote content.
* In fact, you can now open handwritten notes on any device that has the Evernote app. Plus, Evernote search is fully baked in and it’s quite clever, too: the cloud is able to parse your digital ink notes and turn them into easily searchable text. The new version also comes with more sharing options and support for eleven languages. Did I mention that Penultimate now doesn’t cost a dime?
* This version of Penultimate requires iOS 6 and Evernote assures us the iOS 5 support is coming in the next update. Additional paper and pen types are available as in-app purchases.
* A blog post by Evernote explains how searching handwritten notes works:
* Handwriting is processed on the Evernote servers, which means that you need to give Penultimate a few minutes to sync before you can expect results to show up. To make notes even easier to find, we also recommend that you give your notebooks useful titles, which you can do by tapping on the title on the cover of a closed notebook.
* A few screenshots.
