* Apple’s next LCD iPhone could come in multiple bright colors to distinguish it from the two upcoming OLED models. This rumor comes from Rosenblatt’s Jun Zhang and first published by StreetInsider.
* According to the analyst, the so-called “iPhone 8s” could launch in blue, yellow, and pink. They explain:
* Since Apple start to launch three new models every year, we believe the company needs to differentiate the designs of the LCD model from the two high end OLED models.
* One reasonable choice would be to add different colors.
* Looking ahead to 2019, the analyst says Apple might move from a dual-camera setup to a triple-camera one. At the same time, the company might place a 3D sensor in rear of the device.
* This September, Apple’s expected to reveal an iPhone X successor alongside a 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus” model. It’s also likely to announce one low-cost 6.1-inch LCD model. Under this scenario, the iPhone X is probably being discontinued.
* Last week, Japanese blog Mac Otakara said the iPhone X Plus with its 6.5-inch OLED display will be 0.2mm thicker than the current 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus due to the “mounting form” of its vertical dual-lens rear camera.
* By comparison, iPhone 8 Plus is 7.5mm thick and iPhone X measures in at 7.7mm thick. In other words, iPhone X Plus will be no thicker than the current iPhone X model.
* Zhang’s comments about this year’s LCD iPhone sound more like speculation, not something based on supply chain information. Nonetheless, the suggestion does make sense and could be a suitable way for consumers to tell the difference between each new iPhone model.
* Still, this choice does come with some risk. By offering new colors, Apple would be reminding us of the colorful iPhone 5c which launched in a variety of colors in 2013 only to be discontinued a year later.
* What say you? Are you for the return of a blue, yellow, and pink, iPhone? Let us know in the comments below.
