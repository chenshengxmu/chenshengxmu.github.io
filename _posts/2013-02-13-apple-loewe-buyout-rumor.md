title: Apple (again) mentioned in a rumored Loewe takeover bid
---
* In a déjà vu moment, Reuters this morning reported that shares of the German luxury TV maker Loewe surged 33 percent on renewed talk of a possible acquisition by Apple. The news gathering organization quotes a trader who claims Apple supposedly wants to bid 4 euros a share for Loewe, or approximately $5,28 a share, a 40 percent premium above the company’s closing price on Tuesday.
* Loewe’s current market cap sits at 53 million euros, or about $71 million. With its $137 billion cash mountain, Apple could buy Loewe outright without blinking. Nearly one-third of Loewe, or 28 percent, is owned by Sharp, an Apple supplier that was involved in the Apple television rumor last summer…
* Loewe itself holds another fourteen percent and French storage vendor LaCie holds another 11.2 percent.
* Reuters acknowledges that Apple has been long rumored to be working on a standalone television set, reminding us that the company hasn’t launched a major new product in almost three years, apart from the iPad mini.
* Loewe has certainly seen better days:
* Loewe is axing a fifth of its 1,000 jobs after losses almost tripled to 29 million euros in 2012 and it is trying to strengthen its cooperation with Sharp.
* In May 2012, AppleInsider reported that Apple wanted to acquire Loewe and was willing to pay a 48 percent premium for the luxury TV maker, which was established in Berlin in 1923.

* The maker of high-end home entertainment sets, however, debunked the audacious takeover bid rumor, telling the media there was “absolutely nothing to it.”
* We’ll see if things are different this time around.
* If Reuters says a possible takeover bid is on the table, it must be true, no?
* Oh, wait.
