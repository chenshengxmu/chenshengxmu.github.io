* Announced a month ago, Google’s live TV streaming bundle launched today in five U.S. markets. Named YouTube TV, it’s available in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.
* YouTube TV gives you access to live TV streaming from Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC and popular cable networks along with content from 39 other local broadcast networks and channels like ESPN, in exchange for $35 per month.
* DVR, a feature similar services would sell you as an optional add-on, is included in your monthly YouTube TV subscription free of charge. Featuring unlimited cloud storage, DVR lets you record your favorite shows even if they’re on at the same time.
* Google keeps each of your recordings on servers for nine months.
* They released the free YouTube TV app on App Store that puts live TV in the palm of your hand, letting you enjoy the service on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* “When signing up, you’ll need to physically be in your home area, or wherever you’ll most frequently use YouTube TV,” notes Google.
* This is to ensure you get access to the correct local networks.
* You need to live in one of the aforementioned areas to sign up for YouTube TV. Once you’ve signed up, YouTube TV works everywhere in the U.S. If you sign up in a launched area that’s not your home area, you may lose access to YouTube TV.
* If you’re in a location where YouTube TV has launched, you’ll have access to live local networks, national networks and your recordings. Using YouTube TV in a location where the service has yet to launch will limit your experience to national networks and recordings in your library.
* The following channels are included in the basic monthly package:
* Certain sports channels, such as Fox Soccer Plus, and premium networks like Showtime are available for an additional monthly charge. Again, DVR with unlimited storage is included in your subscription at no additional charge.
* As part of your subscription, YouTube TV can be used with up to six accounts in your household without having to share passwords (each member gets his or her own DVR).
* For more information, visit tv.youtube.com/tv/availability.
* You can try YouTube TV free for 30 days by signing up at tv.youtube.com.
* Are you impressed by YouTube TV?
* Is it a better value than Direct TV NOW, Sling TV, Playstation Due, Netflix or HBO NOW?
