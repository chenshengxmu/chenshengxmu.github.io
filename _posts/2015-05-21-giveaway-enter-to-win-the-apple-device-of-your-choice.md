* If you’re an Apple fan, chances are you have at least one of their gadgets on your wish list right now. Which makes us pretty psyched to be the bearers of great news: you now have a chance to get the Apple toy of your choice off your wish list and into your hands. In partnership with StackSocial, The Choose Your Own Apple Toy giveaway is now open at iDownloadBlog Deals and you have until June 17th to enter.
* If you’re the lucky winner, you’ll get your pick of any Apple gadget retailing for up to $700. Snap up the Apple Watch and connect with friends, send and receive email and texts, and track your fitness from your wrist. Or pick up the iPad Air, the best tablet on the market with a stunning display and an impressive suite of apps. Upgrading your phone? Choose the iPhone 6 and get a bigger display, better performance, and the world’s most advance operating system. Or binge-watch your favorite shows, watch live sports, listen to music from the iCloud, and stream content from your iPhone or iPad with the Apple TV. The choice is yours—any Apple product up to $700 qualifies. The bad news: you can only choose one.
* The good news: entering the giveaway couldn’t be easier. Just head over to iDownloadBlog Deals and enter your email address—that’s it. The giveaway is open to users worldwide but you must be age 21+ to enter. Even better news? You can increase your odds of winning by sharing the giveaway on Twitter. The more of your friends and followers enter, the more extra entries you get. And since the giveaway doesn’t end until June 17th, you have weeks to try to get as many entries as possible. Just keep in mind you and your friends need to be 21 to enter.
* Feeling lucky? Get your entry in now — the Apple toy giveaway is now open at iDownloadBlog Deals!
