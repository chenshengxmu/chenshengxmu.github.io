* One of my favorite features about IntelliscreenX is the fact that you can access your notification center from your lock screen. I don’t use the popular tweak anymore, it was too much for me. And that’s really the only element I miss.
* Since I dropped Intelliscreenx, I’ve been looking for a developer to come up with a standalone jailbreak tweak to enable lock screen notification center access. And finally, it’s here. Introducing Bulletin…
* From developer Ma Jun comes Bulletin, a simple utility for enabling iOS 5’s notification center from your lock screen. This way you can access all of your useful notification center widgets without needing to unlock your device.
* The tweak comes with a handful of options, accessible from the Settings application. You can turn lock screen notification center access off and on, and enable/disable window transparency.
* For the most part, Bulletin works as advertised. I’ve noticed that the notification center sticks from time to time, but it’s nothing in comparison with the convenience of having access to my notification center widgets from my lock screen.
* If you want to check out Bulletin, it’s available in the Cydia Store, BigBoss repo, for $0.99.
* Have you tried out Bulletin yet?
