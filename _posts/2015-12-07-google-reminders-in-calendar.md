* Google’s standalone Calendar app was released in the App Store in March of 2105 and today the software is getting some interesting new features: Reminders, 3D Touch support and a cool Star Wars skin for those who have opted to join either the Dark or Light side of the Force at google.com/starwars. Reminders in Google Calendar make it easier to keep track of your to-dos alongside your events—in one place, no need to juggle between different apps.
* In certain situations, reminders can be way more useful than events. While events come and go, reminders “stick with you over time so you can track them until they are actually done,” argues the search monster.
* Due reminders and those that aren’t completed yet appear at the top of your Calendar the next day to ensure you stay on top of things. To mark a reminder as completed, just swipe it away.
* And because this is Google, reminders in the Calendar app gain phone numbers and addresses automatically, based on information from your contacts and Google’s knowledge graph.
* “So if you add a reminder to make call or run an errand, the number or address will be right there when you need it,” writes Google. The best bit: reminders can also be created in Google’s Inbox, Keep and Search apps.
* In the official Google app for iOS, for example, you can say things like “Ok Google, remind me to buy birthday candles” and a new reminder will be created for you and become instantly available across the aforesaid apps.
* And as you tick off reminders, they’re marked as completed across apps and platforms. As mentioned, the just-refreshed Calendar app also lets you create events and reminders using 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus.
* Reminders in Google Calendar will be rolling out this week on iOS and Android, with the updated iOS app already live in the App Store. Reminders will be added to the Google Calendar web interface at a later stage.
* Google Calendar requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
* Grab Google Calendar for free in the App Store.
