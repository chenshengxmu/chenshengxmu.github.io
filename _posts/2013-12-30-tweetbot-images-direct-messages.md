* One of the most-loved Twitter clients for the iPhone and iPad, Tapbots’ Tweetbot, has been updated with the ability to view images included in Direct Messages.
* Available as a free update in the App Store, Tweetbot version 3.2.1 brings various bug fixes and the ability to view images attached to Direct Messages.
* Twitter has enabled image attachments in Direct Messages two weeks ago and Tweetbot is among the first apps to support this neat little feature…
* Unfortunately, you can view but not send images in Direct Messages using Tweetbot.
* Actually, this is true for all third-party Twitter clients because Twitter’s public API currently does not currently support this capability in apps other than Twitter’s own.
* Thus far, only Twitter’s official app for the iPhone and iPad (a free download from the App Store) lets you send images in Direct Messages, a feature they added in mid-December. Don’t worry, the micro-blogging service is said to be allowing image-sending in Direct Messages via its public API soon enough.

* So how’s this important then?
* Basically, if I’m using Twitter’s app to attach a screenshot or a photo to a Direct Message, you’ll be now able to see it if you’re using Tweetbot.
* Release notes accompanying the download make no mention of other improvements besides bug fixes and viewing images in Direct Messages.
* Tweetbot 3 for the iPhone and iPod touch is $4.99 in the App Store.
* The iPad edition is a separate $2.99 download.
* Note that Tweetbot for iPad hasn’t yet been refreshed with the iOS 7 look and feel – hence the lower price.
