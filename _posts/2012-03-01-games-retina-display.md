* A Retina display seems almost confirmed to be featured on the iPad 3, as more rumors and pictures have popped up over the past few weeks. A Retina display on the iPad 3 will be of astonishing quality. Just look at your iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S screen’s quality, and then picture it on the iPad. Just wow.
* The guys over at Pixels on Toast have already started getting their upcoming game Food Run ready for the 2048×1536 resolution. In doing so, they have showed us what a game running on that high quality of screen looks like. And it looks amazing…
* We’re not used to seeing so many pixels on such a large screen, and it should be like the iPhone 4(S)’s screen — where you can’t even see the pixels.
* So when will we officially know if the iPad 3 will feature a Retina display or not? Apple is set to unveil the iPad 3 at an event in San Francisco, California March 7th. The iPad 3 is rumored to pack a Retina display, larger battery, upgraded cameras, LTE, and quad-core processor. There are also rumors that the iPad 3 will not feature a home button, but some have deemed the notion just silly.
* A tablet with such a high quality display will be groundbreaking. Let’s just hope developers are quick to get their games and apps up to Retina quality.
* What do you think of a tablet with such a high-quality display?
