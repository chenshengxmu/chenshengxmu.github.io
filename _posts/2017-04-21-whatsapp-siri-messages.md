* The popular messaging app WhatsApp for iPhone was update yesterday with a few new features, bringing the ability to have Siri read new messages you have received via the service. The Facebook-owned software now supports the Persian language while the Group Info, Contact Info and Calls sections have been revamped to make them easier to use. WhatsApp’s two-factor authentication interface was tweaked as well.
* You can now ask Siri to read aloud new messages you have received on WhatsApp.
* Before you can use this and other SiriKit features within the app, you must first enable Siri support for WhatsApp in Settings → Siri → App Support. Keep in mind that asking Siri to read your latest messages on WhatsApp requires iOS 10.3 or later.

* Like before, you can also ask Siri to call or message people on WhatsApp.
* Another enhancement in this edition of WhatsApp includes a reworked Contact Info screen that’s now more informative than before, as shown on the screenshot below. The Group Info screen and the Calls tab have seen some visual improvements, too.

* For instance, the Voice Call icon has been replaced with a plus symbol that, when tapped, shows a list of contacts that you can call via voice and video. In the My Updates screen, you can now select multiple statuses at once and forward or delete them.
