* If you own an iPhone, then chances are your battery life is important to you. The importance of conserving battery life is probably increased even more when you’re jailbroken and have lots of tweaks running on your device as you use it.
* Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called NoATWAKEUP is here to help, as the developer says it can have a positive impact on your battery life.
* According to the tweak’s Cydia description, the it is designed to prevent a launch daemon (a piece of software that runs in the background) called ATWAKEUP (com.apple.atc.atwakeup) from functioning the moment you turn your device on.
* The daemon has limited uses, and so having it running in the background can be pointless and waste power depending on how you use your device.
* According to the developer on Reddit, it’s related to Bluetooth, allowing the iPhone to send a signal to nearby sleeping Bluetooth devices in a persistent manner to keep it ready for when you want to use it:
* The ATWAKEUP daemon sends a signal approximately every 10-30 seconds to any “sleeping” paired Bluetooth connected media device to wake it up…in the event that you decide to press the “Play” button in either the control center or multitasking view.
* The developer also explains how to tell whether or not you need NoATWAKEUP:
* If you have CrashReporter installed and have never seen a crash report with “atc.atwakeup” or “atwakeup” then chances are you’re one of the lucky ones who won’t need NoATWAKEUP to save the day! If you have DetailedBatteryUsage installed and haven’t seen “atc.atwakeup” show up in the BATTERY USAGE list then you too are most likely ok! If you haven’t had trouble with ATWAKEUP you probably don’t need this tweak, and any battery savings would most likely be negligible…however it won’t hurt anything if you’d like to try it anyway!
* Disabling it doesn’t impact the functionality of your device as you would normally use it throughout the day, unless you rely on these kinds of devices. Even if you do, disabling it would, at the worst, slow down the process of getting music to play on the device, which isn’t a huge trade off for the battery savings.
* So far, the developer says more than 2,100 people have installed the tweak and no one has reported any problems connecting to their Bluetooth devices, so the potential to save power could be worth it if you’re trying to squeeze every last drop of juice out of your iPhone’s battery. You shouldn’t, however, expect any miraculously unrealistic gains, since it’s a minor modification.
* For those interested in downloading NoATWAKEUP to see how it fares, it can be had for free in Cydia’s BigBoss repository. It can be downloaded and installed on iOS 8.0-9.3.3.
* The tweak requires a reboot to fully initialize, and you won’t be prompted to reboot your device after installation, so you must do so manually. If you’re running the Pangu semi-untethered jailbreak, don’t forget to boot semi-untethered with the Pangu loader tool after the device powers back up.
