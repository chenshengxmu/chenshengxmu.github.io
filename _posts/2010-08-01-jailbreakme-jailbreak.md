title: JailbreakMe Jailbreak for All Devices
---
* It’s here folks! The long-awaited jailbreak for iOS 4 is now available and it’s called JailbreakMe. Those of you who’ve been jailbreaking their iPhones for a while will certainly remember JailbreakMe, which is without a doubt the easiest jailbreak ever.

* Simply go to JailbreakMe.com from your iPhone and follow the instructions. Really you can’t go wrong with that.
* Comex has done a great job by reviving JailbreakMe and bringing back the browser-based jailbreak to the iPhone.
* JailbreakMe will work for every iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad starting at iOS 3.1.2. That means that if your iDevice is at 3.1.2 or newer, then you’re good.
* I’m in the desert right now and can’t get JailbreakMe to download so I will report more about it as I get closer to civilization…
* In the meanwhile, please share your experience downloading and installing JailbreakMe on your iPhone.
