* Following multiple complaints that the iOS 9.3.2 software update, which released two days ago, has bricked some 9.7-inch iPad Pro models with ‘Error 56’, Apple today acknowledged that it’s aware of these reports and is “looking” into them.
* Although Apple’s statement to iMore does not make it clear whether the company has pinpointed what might be causing this issue, the company did advise those unable to restore their device through iTunes to contact its support team.
* “We’re looking into a small number of reports that some iPad units are receiving an error when updating the software,” an Apple spokesperson told iMore. “Those unable to restore their device through iTunes should contact Apple support.”

* Some people complained that installing the over-the-air update would brick their device, making it stuck at the ‘Connect to iTunes’ prompt. As per web reports, plugging the tablet into a computer and trying to restore through iTunes wouldn’t resolve the issue.
* If you’re plagued by this issue, your best option is to schedule a trip to the Genius Bar or wait it out until Apple has determined the cause of the bug and issued an emergency fix.
