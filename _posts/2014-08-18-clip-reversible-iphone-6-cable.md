* Along with the many enhancements and improvements expected in the iPhone 6 this fall, the handset is also expected to ship with a new, reversible Lightning to USB cable. We’ve seen multiple photos of the alleged cable, and Apple even holds a patent for such a design.
* Tonight comes more evidence of the theory, with frequent part-leaker Sonny Dickson posting a video showing the new cable in action. It appears to work similar to the Lightning side of the current cable, allowing the user to plug in the USB side, regardless of orientation…
* While the video does seem to show a reversible USB cable, we don’t actually see a connected iPhone. It’s also worth pointing out that there’s no USB logo on the reverse side of the plug, and the box in the clip matches those seen in previous leaks (above), with no Apple logo.
* Last week, the USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced the completion of its USB Type-C specification that “defines the next generation USB connector.” The Type C connector features a new design, faster transfer speeds, reversible plug orientation, and will start shipping next year.
