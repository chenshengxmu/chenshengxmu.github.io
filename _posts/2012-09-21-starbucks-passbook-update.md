* Been wondering when you would be able to take your shiny new iPhone into a Starbucks and use Passbook to pay for your grande skinny vanilla latte? Well, wonder no more.
* We’ve just spied a Twitter update from the company itself in which we learn that an iOS 6 compatible version of the app, complete with Passbook support, will be with us by the end of the month!
* What’s more, Starbucks even added a little bit of geekery to proceedings by signing off with a spot of binary code, just for the lolz…
* Updated to iOS 6? Our Passbook update is coming at the end of this month! 00111010 00101001

* We’ve covered Passbook in detail already, and we’re sure we are not the only ones looking forward to adding Starbucks to our collection of cards. But what about that binary?
* Well, a swift wander over to a binary converter shows us that the code ‘00111010 00101001’ actually equates to a good old smiley face! Aww, how gloriously geeky!
