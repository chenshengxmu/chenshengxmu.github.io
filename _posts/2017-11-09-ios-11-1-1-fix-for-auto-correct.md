* Apple on Thursday released iOS 11.1.1 update for iPhones and iPads. Today’s update comes a little over a week after iOS 11.1 was pushed out to the public, and it fixes two significant bugs that have been impacting a large number of users: Hey Siri randomly stops working and an issue with keyboard auto-correct. 
* Users affected by the auto-correct bug will be glad it’s finally fixed. The bug causes the letter “I” to auto-correct to “A[?],” causing confusion for folks sending text messages and posting on social media. The bug had become so prominent, in fact, that it had begun spawning memes and other jokes online.
* If we spot any other notable changes in today’s update, we’ll let you know. To install 11.1.1 on your own device, navigate to the Settings app > General > Software Update. Apple has also recently begun seeding iOS 11.2 betas to developers and public testers with support for Apple Pay Cash and other new features.
