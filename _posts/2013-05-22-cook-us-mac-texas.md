* Apple CEO Tim Cook, while squirming Tuesday under Congressional questions about the company’s tax-savings tactics, revealed an interesting tidbit: the Lone Star State will build the the tech giant’s made-in-USA Mac. Testifying before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Cook said the Mac would be assembled in Texas, with parts coming from other regions of the country…
* Today speculation centered on Apple’s largest foreign partner playing a hand in the Mac’s creation.
* Here’s what Cook told U.S. senators:
* We’re investing $100 million to build a Mac product line here in the U.S..
* The product will be assembled in Texas, include components made in Illinois and Florida, and rely on equipment produced in Kentucky and Michigan.
* While the cash may come from Apple, the nuts-and-bolts of producing the U.S.-based Mac line could come from one of its largest partners, known more for its roots in China.
* “Foxconn operates plants in Texas and has long handled a lot of Apple hardware production and assembly,” noted John Paczkowski of AllThingsD.
* Perhaps signaling plans to produce some Macs – potentially the Mac Pro, which is way overdue for a refresh – the company recently began increasing its production capacity to accomodate unspecified customer demands.
