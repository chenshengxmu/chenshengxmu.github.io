* Tech sites are buzzing today in response to an interesting tweet this morning by known tech guru Leo Laporte. The former spokesman for Tech T.V. told the Twitter world that he had heard on “good authority” that Apple has hired Tomlinson Holman to head up the company’s audio projects.
* For folks who aren’t familiar with Holman’s work, just check out any THX-certified movie or stereo system. The audio pioneer developed the technology back in the early 1980’s while working at Lucasfilms. He also engineered the world’s first 10.2 surround sound system.
* What could Apple want with an audio specialist of this caliber? One theory is that Apple has brought Tomlinson on board to help work on their rumored TV device. Apple’s motto has always been to make technology easier for the everyday person, what if they were looking to do that with home theatre?
* Imagine a mid-sized T.V. set (24″-37″) with new LED technology and state-of-the art sound. Combine this with current Apple TV amenities like AirPlay and you have a pretty interesting concept.
* Although Apple hasn’t commented on the hiring of the Lucasfilm expert, it wouldn’t be the first time they hired  a high profile employee. Apple recently hired PR executives from Activision and Nintendo, fueling speculation that they are looking to bump up their share of the gaming market. With all of these new talented editions added to their roster, it’ll be interesting to see what the Cupertino company comes up with next.
* What do you think?
