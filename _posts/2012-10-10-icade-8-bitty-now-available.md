* Back in February, the folks over at ThinkGeek unveiled a new wireless game controller for iOS devices called the 8-Bitty. It resembled an NES controller, and was based on the popular iCade platform.
* Today, ThinkGeek has announced that the 8-Bitty controller is now available for purchase. It’s compatible with all iCade games, as well as MAME titles, and it costs a lot less than you might think…
* ThinkGeek describes the 8-Bitty as a retro-styled game controller that fits in your pocket. It has 8 buttons, runs on two triple A batteries, and connects to your iOS (or Android) device via Bluetooth.
* The list of compatible iOS games is surprisingly long thanks to the early success of the iCade. Several app developers have built-in support for the controller, including Atari and Imangi (Temple Run).
* In addition to the 50 or so iOS games, the 8-Bitty is also compatible with the iMAME4all jailbreak app, which is an emulator that allows users to import and play classic video games via MAME ROMs.
* The good news is, the 8-Bitty is now available for purchase from ThinkGeek’s website. And it’s fairly inexpensive compared to other controllers. If you’re interested, you can snag one for just $29.99.
* So, what do you think of the iCade 8-Bitty?
