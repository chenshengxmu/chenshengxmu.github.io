* Apple loaded a number of new features into its third-generation iPad: a faster processor, more RAM, and let’s not forget LTE. The company’s latest tablet also includes a much-needed camera upgrade, bringing the backside sensor to 5MP.
* This finally makes the iPad a viable option for taking photographs and shooting videos while on-the-go. And thanks to the folks over at Manhattan Edit Workshop, it could become the preferred method. Introducing the Padcaster iPad case…
* The Padcaster is a rugged case that allows you to connect a DSLR lens to the iPad’s camera, and mount the tablet on a standing tripod. You can even add a flash and other accessories such as an external microphone or a filter. Mix in the fact that the iPad can run hundreds of photo and video editing applications, and you have the recipe for quite the portable setup.
* The case isn’t cheap though — the Padcaster will run you around $200. And it looks like you’ll have to fork over another $80 for the Lenscaster mount.
* The item is currently on backorder, but you can get availability updates through the company’s Twitter account here.
* What do you think of the Padcaster?
