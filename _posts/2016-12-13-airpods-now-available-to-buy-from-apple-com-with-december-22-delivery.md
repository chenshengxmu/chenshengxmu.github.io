* Following an unexpected delay over manufacturing issues, AirPods are now finally available to purchase from Apple’s online store, with delivery before Christmas. Apple’s first Bluetooth earphones, AirPods feature an in-house designed wireless chip, dubbed W1, which provides reliable wireless connection, extended battery life and a few smart features, such as one-tap Siri integration, seamless zero-configuration pairing via iCloud, the ability for AirPods to automatically turn on when you put them in your ear and more. When used with non-Apple devices, the $159 earphones act as any standard Bluetooth device.
* As seen on the screenshot below, the Apple Online Store in the United States lists AirPods with December 22 delivery. You can order yours at this Apple Store link.

* Apple pundit John Gruber said two days ago that AirPods would launch in time for Christmas. Before him, Apple’s boss Tim Cook last month wrote in an alleged response to a customer email inquiring about AirPods availability that the earphones would begin shipping in a few weeks.
* The $159 accessory ships with the included Lightning to USB cable and the charging case which allows them to be recharged on the go. A built-in battery inside each AirPod provides five hours of listening time on one charge. Apple says that just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening time.
* Thanks to the case that holds multiple additional charges, you can get more than 24 hours of listening time before the case needs recharging via its built-in Lightning port.
* AirPods are compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models with iOS 10 or later, Apple Watch models with watchOS 3 or later and Mac models with macOS Sierra or later. And as mentioned, they work as standard Bluetooth headphones (sans the smarts provided by the W1 chip) on non-Apple devices.
* Will you be purchasing AirPods?
