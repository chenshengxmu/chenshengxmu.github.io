* Hot on the heels of officially announcing the major $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics LCC., and ahead of its SVP Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi’s joint appearance at the Code Conference tonight, Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre’s four months old music service has just sweetened the deal.
* The startup has dropped the price of Beats Music yearly subscription free to $99.99, down from $119.88.
* Additionally, the previous 7-day free trial of Beats Music has now been extended in a “no strings attached” move to fourteen days to all users…
* From iTunes release notes:
* We’re stocked to announce that our no strings attached trial has been extended to 14 days to ensure everyone gets ample time to explore the full Beats Music experience.
* According to a newly refreshed FAQ on the Beats website, user who do not wish to purchase a yearly subscription will continue to pay ten bucks per month.
* Everyone can try Beats Music for free for the first 14 days. After that, you pay $9.99 monthly or $99.99 yearly for unlimited streaming music.
* The monthly subscription is on par with Spotify, the most popular streaming music product which comes with a library of 20 million songs, just like Beats Music.
* The Beats Music app for the iPhone and iPad has been bumped to version 2.1 to reflect the pricing structure changes. Additionally, the new version offers tongs of bug fixes “so the whole experience runs smooth as silk.”
* With today’s Beats buy, Apple now in fact owns an on-demand streaming music service that’s available not only on its own platform, but on rival Android and Windows Phone, too.
* You can download Beats Music free in the App Store.
* The app is universal and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
