* Waze is one of the most popular third-party navigation apps for the iOS platform, but some users find that the interface isn’t without its quirks. For example, the swipe gesture you might use to access the app’s built-in menu could potentially clash with other gestures.
* If you experience this problem yourself, then a new free jailbreak tweak called FarewellGestureWaze by iOS developer CydiaGeek should remedy the problem. After installation, it prevents this gesture from launching the Waze app’s built-in menu.
* There are a couple of possible scenarios where this gesture might not cooperate with your intentions, such as:
* Notably, you can access the very same menu by tapping the search button located in the bottom-left of the Waze app, so the swipe gesture seems redundant right out of the box. That said, FarewellGestureWaze won’t deprive you of functionality you don’t already have access to.
* FarewellGestureWaze does reduce the potential for gesture conflicts, but this depends on how you use your device and will be highly subjective. With that in mind, demand for this tweak will vary significantly from one person to the next, depending on their unique setup and situation.
* If you’re in the same boat as the niche of people who want to disable the Waze app’s menu-based swipe gesture, then FarewellGestureWaze might be something to consider. To get it, you’ll need to add CydiaGeek’s beta repository to Cydia by following these steps:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you can locate and install FarewellGestureWaze by searching Cydia or by checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
* FarewellGestureWaze works with all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices and works with the latest version of the Waze app as of this writing (version 4.33). If you aren’t already using Waze, you can download it for free from the App Store.
