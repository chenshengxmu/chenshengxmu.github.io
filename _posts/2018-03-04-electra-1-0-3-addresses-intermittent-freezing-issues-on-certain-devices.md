* CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 has been updated to version 1.0.3 on Sunday with bug fixes and improvements.
* Citing the official Electra web page, version 1.0.3 brings with it the following changes:
* As it would seem, this update addresses an intermittent freezing problem that was impacting a handful of devices running Electra 1.0.2 or earlier. Installing it should stop these freezes from occurring, assuming it wasn’t being caused by a faulty jailbreak tweak.
* Like the original public release, Electra 1.0.3 includes a patched version of Cydia that lets users install iOS 11-compatible jailbreak tweaks. Saurik continues to work on official iOS 11 updates for Cydia and Mobile Substrate at this time, but it doesn’t seem likely that either will ever be made compatible with Electra (or LiberiOS, for that matter).
* Anyone that might be relying on the Electra jailbreak is advised to download and install the latest version of the tool for stability purposes.
* Electra can be downloaded from CoolStar’s website. For safety and security reasons, you shouldn’t download Electra from anywhere else.
