* Apple published a new video to its website and YouTube channel Sunday, highlighting how some artists use iPad to make music. Featuring recording artist Elliphant, the one minute long video discretely showcases a few apps used by the musician to create music in a radical new way.
* The song, called All or Nothing (Riton iPad Remix Feat. The Gaslamp Killer), is very engaging, to say the least.
