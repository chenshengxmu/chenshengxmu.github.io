* Have you ever shared something to Instagram and then wished you could fix a typo or choice of wording in your caption; or perhaps you’ve shared something and completely forgot to add your caption or hashtags in the first place? You’re not alone.
* Instagram makes it possible for you to edit the captions of your photos and videos after it’s already posted to your profile. In this tutorial, we’ll show you the steps required to do so.
* Caption editing is only available from the mobile Instagram app, which can be downloaded from the App Store for free. Unfortunately, the option to edit media captions isn’t available from the web app.
* Keep in mind that after you edit a caption on Instagram, you can continue to go back and change it over and over again. You’re not limited to editing only once.
* Note that just like on Facebook and many other social networking services, Instagram reveals to other users when a caption was edited. The indicator appears when someone attempts to leave a comment on your media and it’s intended as a common courtesy for your followers in case they notice something inconsistent when viewing your posts.
* Now that you know the circumstances surrounding editing the caption of a post on Instagram, you can follow these steps to move forward with editing your captions:
* 1) Launch the Instagram app from your Home screen.
* 2) Tap on the Profile tab at the bottom of the app.
* 3) Locate and tap on the media that contains the caption you wish you edit.

* You won’t always need to edit your Instagram captions, but it’s good to understand how to do it. After all, sometimes you post things in a rush, which leads to embarrassing typos and mistakes. Being able to quickly nix those mistakes before everyone sees them is a great privilege to have.
