* Finally, the iPad can lay claim to a Clock app of its own. That’s right, with iOS 6, comes a new Clock app built from the ground up with the iPad in mind. The first word that might come to your head after initially laying eyes on the Clock app is “beautiful”, as it’s accented with a level of detail that Apple is famous for.
* Included with the Clock app is a world clock capable of storing up to 24 different locations, along with the obligatory alarm, stop watch, and timer functions. Check out our full video walkthrough of the new Clock app for all of the details. Be sure to comment and let us know what you think about it.
