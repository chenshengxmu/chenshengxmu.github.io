* All eyes are on Apple this week, as the entire tech industry awaits the company’s iPhone 5 announcement. Although Tim Cook and company haven’t officially said anything yet, there’s a lot of evidence piling up that suggests it’s close.
* Besides the new smartphone, there are a few other highly anticipated announcements that Apple is expected to make in the coming weeks. There’s iCloud, Apple’s painless sync and storage service, and of course iOS 5…
* It’s been 18 days since Apple seeded beta 7 of the new software, so we’d be remiss not to expect the next release shortly. MacRumors helped shine some light on the subject last night, by announcing the latest word from Apple to developers:
* “On Thursday, September 22, the iCloud Backup data will be reset. Backing up to iCloud or restoring from an iCloud backup will be unavailable from 9 AM PDT – 5 PM PDT. If you attempt a backup or restore during this time, you will receive an alert that the backup or restore was not successful. After this reset, you will be unable to restore from any backup created prior to September 22. A ful backup will happen automatically the next time your device backs up to iCloud.”
* As Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac points out, the iCloud reset date lines up well with the rumors of an iOS 5 GM seed on September 23rd. Game Center was reset the day before iOS 4.1 was released, so it isn’t crazy to think a GM build isn’t too far off.
* Of course the other part of that rumor suggests that iOS 5 beta 8 would be dropping last Friday (which didn’t happen), so you can’t take that report too seriously. But with the purported iPhone 5 launch date inching closer, expect this to be an exciting week.
