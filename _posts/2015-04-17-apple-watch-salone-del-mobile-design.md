* Apple is showing off the Apple Watch at the Salone Del Mobile Design fair in Milan, Italy, with SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, and industrial designer, Marc Newson, both on hand at the event.
* The device is displayed in rows of glass-topped tables inside the Carlo e Camilla restaurant in Segheria. In addition to using literally the same tables found in its own retail stores, Apple’s replicated the U.S. Apple Store try-on experience at the fair.
* This despite the device not yet being available for pre-order in Italy. Thankfully, Italian blog Macitynet.it and French site iGen.fr have provided several photographs of Schiller and Newson showing off their device and posing for photographs.

* And here’s Jony Ive’s friend, renowned industrial designer Marc Newson, wearing his stainless steel Watch with black Sport band. Apple hired Newson last year on a part-time basis, to help design the Watch and possibly other products.

* The Apple Watch is currently available for pre-order in the following nine markets only: the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
* Italy, along with other European markets, is likely to be included in the yet-to-be-announced second wave of Watch expansion.
