* Apple has given the green light for a second season of Carpool Karaoke, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves announced on Thursday (via THR). During CBS’ earnings conference call with investors, Moonves pointed to the renewal as an example of how the popularity of the network’s late night hosts translated into new projects.
* For those unfamiliar with the show, Apple’s “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” was developed as a spinoff to the popular segment on James Corden’s Late Late Show. It features famous musicians and other celebrities singing along with trendy music while riding in a car, and it’s only available to paid Apple Music subscribers.
* Carpool Karaoke was just Apple’s second foray into original programing, behind Planet of the Apps, but recent reports suggest it has much more on the way. The company is currently working on a basketball drama series with Kevin Durant, a drama with La La Land creator Damien Chapelle, and an extraordinary home docuseries.
