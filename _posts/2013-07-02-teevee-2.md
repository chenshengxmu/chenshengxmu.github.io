* As I tend to repeatedly mention here, I’m a big fan of movies and television shows (wanted to be an actor when I was a kid). Now, most of my premium entertainment is consumed digitally these days so I’m big on apps that help me manage and discover great TV shows and movies.
* For the latter, I use Limelight which lets me organize and manage my movie library in style.
* I’m also a heavy user of ToDo Movies to track upcoming releases and its eye-popping Motion Posters feature has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. You could imagine my excitement discovering TeeVee 2, an elegant and sophisticated iPhone application by Tomas Perzl which helps me keep track of next episodes of my favorite TV shows, when they are airing, the days remaining, the episode title/synopsis and lots more…
* Although it’s built on the idea of the originally TeeVee 1, TeeVee 2 is a brand new app that introduces a host of new features presented via a precise and unobtrusive user interface that’s much cleaner and easier to use than its predecessor.
* The sole purpose of this app is to lay out information about next episodes of your favorite TV shows.
* Tracking your fav show is easy: just type its title into the search box and add it to your watch list. To remove the show from the list, swipe right.
* For the shows added to your list, you can mark them as seen or drill into per-episode details by swiping left. I also like watching episode previews so that’s supported, too.
* Design and typography-wise, this thing is iOS 7-ready.

* You can, of course, easily re-arrange and organize your shows or just marvel at the gorgeous cover artwork.
* I’ll let moving pictures do the talking.
* As seen on the screenies above, TV shows include useful metadata like the upcoming episode’s title, genre, run time, cast, information about other episodes and so forth.
* You can tell TeeVee 2 to send you push alerts every time an upcoming episode is about to be aired in your local time zone.

* I’m liking this app a lot and don’t have any major gripes with it (iCloud syncing is being worked on, in case you’ve been wondering about that).
* One customer complained in iTunes reviews that it misses some older shows like Ray Donovan as well as some new ones. If it’s any consolation, TeeVee 2 includes more than 30,000 TV shows.
* If you follow TV shows on a regular basis and were looking for a way to organize your viewing, TeeVee 2 is highly recommended if you’re willing to drop 99 cents on the app.
