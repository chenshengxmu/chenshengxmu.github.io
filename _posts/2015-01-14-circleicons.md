* Want a way to change up the look of the Settings app icons without WinterBoard? Then you might want to give CircleIcons a try, a new jailbreak tweak that masks the icons in the Settings app with a circle shape sans WinterBoard. CircleIcons is a lightweight and fun tweak to modify the look of the Settings app without taking it to extremes.
* After installing CircleIcons, the tweak should begin working immediately, as it is switched on by default. However, there is a preference panel for the CircleIcons in the Settings app that lets you quickly venture back to the default rounded-square look. There’s also another option that allows you to completely omit the presence of icons altogether.

* The cool thing about CircleIcons, which is demonstrated in the video above, is that the icons will update dynamically when switching between the circle icons and the default icons; no resprings are required. You’ll only need to respring when using the switch that completely disables icons, and you won’t even need to respring when enabling the icons again.

* CircleIcons is a fun tweak that’s free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. I really like the look of having circular icons in iOS’ Settings, and I think you may as well. What do you think?
