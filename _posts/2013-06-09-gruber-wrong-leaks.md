* During this week’s episode of The Talk Show podcast, well known Apple dot connector and author of the popular blog Daring Fireball John Gruber offered up a few tidbits he’s heard about what Apple may unveil at its WWDC keynote tomorrow.
* While he notes that he has heard very little about what Apple has in store for this year, Gruber says that he has heard from somebody who is familiar with the company’s plans that “all of the leaks are wrong” in regards to iOS 7…
* Here’s a rough transcript of Gruber’s comments (via MacRumors):
* “I know almost absolutely nothing. I don’t think I’ve been this ignorant of what’s coming, software-wise, for a keynote since the iPhone 1 back in 2007. Which is great…I’m super excited about it. […]
* The one thing I keep hearing over and over again from friends who would know is…the one word I keep hearing is that some of the stuff they’re going to show is “polarizing”.
* And I also heard from somebody that just “all the leaks are wrong”. Which is interesting. I have no idea what to make of it.”
* This is interesting because all of the reports we’ve heard regarding iOS 7 up to this point have matched up. And they all say that since Apple’s executive shakeup last fall, Jony Ive has been very hands on with iOS 7 and is giving it a much needed makeover.
* The Wall Street Journal first reported this back in March of this year, and it’s been corroborated by several reputable outlets since then including 9to5Mac, Bloomberg, and AllThingsD. Ive is said to be pushing for a ‘very flat design.’
* But after Gruber’s comments, it would seem that all bets are off. Which is funny, because if you take away the stuff we think we know about the UI changes, we know next to nothing about what to expect in iOS 7—save for mention of a few minor features.
* And you know what? I’m ok with that.
* Be sure to join iDB tomorrow for full coverage of Apple’s announcements. The keynote is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. PST.
