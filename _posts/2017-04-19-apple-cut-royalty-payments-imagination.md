* As Apple is winding down its supply deal with UK-based GPU designer Imagination Technologies over the next two years, a new report alleges that the Cupertino firm is about to slash payments to Imagination to just one-third of its current royalty rate.
* Reuters cited UBS analysts as predicting that Imagination could very easily become a loss-making company by fiscal 2019 without any Apple royalty contributions. The British GPU designer may even have to axe jobs and consider other potential cost-cutting moves in order to weather the storm ahead.
* Imagination is currently in talks with Apple on a new shorter-term licensing deal.
* UBS analysts caution that the iPhone maker is likely to ratchet down the royalty rate it currently pays to Imagination of around $0.30 to closer to $0.10 per iPhone unit. This is about the same what Imagination typically charges customers like MediaTek.
* Imagination is among suppliers that depend on Apple for more than half of their revenues.
* Such a drastic royalty rate reduction is a huge blow to Imagination—especially given Apple is Imagination’s biggest customer accounting for more than half of its licensing revenues.

* Imagination recently said Apple would stop using its GPU blueprints within 15 to 24 months.
* The development caused Imagination’s stock to lose nearly two thirds of its value in a single day. Analysts are now unsure if the company can survive the fallout with Apple. The Cupertino firm informed Imagination that it’s been working on a separate, independent graphics design.
* Apple’s explanation for severing ties with Imagination in the next two years: it wants to reduce its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. The UK firm reported revenue of more than £120 million (or approximately $150 million) in the year leading up to April 2016.

* Tim Cook & Co. are not ditching Imagination to save money.
* Licensing cost related to Imagination’s PowerVR GPU blueprints used in Apple’s A-series chips is less than $100 million annually, so there’s that.
* Apple was probably unhappy with Imagination’s roadmap and its tile-based deferred rendering technique so it decided to build its own radically new GPU technology from scratch.
* An Apple-designed GPU could incorporate modern features for photorealistic images, such as ray tracing rendering with real-time shadows, reflections and other effects. Imagination threatened to sue Apple if it proceeds with the development of in-house GPUs.
