title: Watch the new iPad TV ad
---
* Well, the fireworks are over, but the fun stuff is just beginning. Like always, Apple has posted the very first TV spot for their new product on their website, and it promotes the iPad’s most compelling new feature.
* Indeed, the Retina display plays front man in Apple’s new TV spot, as it should; it looks stunning. I think they did a really good job of showing off how incredible the display looks.
* What about you?
