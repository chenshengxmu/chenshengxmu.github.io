* Two-Factor Authentication strengthens the security of your Apple ID by preventing anyone from accessing or using it, even if they know your password. With Two-Factor Authentication, one of your trusted devices generates a one-time code when you make a purchase or sign in to your Apple ID, iCloud, iCloud.com, iMessage, FaceTime or Game Center account on a new device. Two-Factor Authentication is also required for Auto Unlock so you can unlock your Mac by wearing an Apple Watch.
* In this tutorial we’ll show you how to protect your Apple ID with Two-Factor Authentication or, if you’re still using the older and less secure Two-Step Verification, upgrade to Two-Factor Authentication.
* Two-Factor Authentication is the preferred protection system for Apple IDs.
* It replaces Two-Step Verification and is more secure because it’s integrated deeply into the bowels of iOS and macOS. The older, less reliable Two-Step Verification system relies on different methods to trust devices and deliver verification codes.
* With Two-Factor Authentication enabled, a six-digit code is required to verify your identity using one of your devices or another approved method before you can:
* See Apple’s support document for more information about Two-Factor Authentication, including an up-to-date list of countries where this feature is available.
* In order to use Two-Factor Authentication, you must own one of the following devices:
* Logging into your Apple ID on a device that has software earlier than specified above may yield a message saying Two-Factor Authentication is unavailable so make sure your gadgets meet the requirements and run the latest software.
* If your Apple ID is protected with the older Two-Step Verification method, you must first disable it before you can opt in to Two-Factor Authentication, Unfortunately, Apple does not provide a direct upgrade path for Two-Factor Authentication.
* If you already use the newer Two-Step Verification system, skip this section and proceed with the steps outlined in the section titled “Enabling Two-Factor Authentication”.
* 1) Sign in to your Apple ID account page using a desktop web browser.
* 2) Click Edit under the Security heading.
* 3) Click Turn Off Two-Step Verification, then create three new security questions and verify your birth date and phone number when asked.

* You will receive an email from Apple confirming that Two-Step Verification for your Apple ID account has been turned off and the Apple ID account page will reflect the change.

* You must provide three security questions and answers, verify your birth date, add a rescue email and verify a mobile phone number where Apple will send you verification codes when your trusted devices are unavailable.
* If you see a message that some of your devices are incompatible with Two-Factor Authentication, hit Turn On Anyway to continue. Enrolling in Two-Factor Authentication will replace your iCloud Security Code with your device passcode.

* That’s it, your Apple ID account is now protected with Two-Step Verification.
* With Two-Factor Authentication enabled, you’ll verify your identity by entering both your Apple ID password and a six-digit verification code any time you sign in to the Apple ID page or iCloud.com, make an iTunes, iBooks or App Store purchase from a new device or sign in to iMessage, FaceTime or Game Center on a new device.

* You can also manually generate a verification code at any time:
