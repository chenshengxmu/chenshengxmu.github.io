* In iOS 12, the search has been redesigned for the Photos app. For example, you can now find photos by location and events.Â 
* The new For You tab includes featured photos, effect suggestions, and sharing suggestions. For example, Photos can now make recommendations to everyone at an event, for example, to share certain photos with everyone else. When your friend receives a photo, their iPhone will look into their Photos app and see if there are other photos worth sharing to others.
