* Now that Samsung has unveiled its flagship handset for 2013, all eyes are on Apple as the tech world waits to see what it has in store for its next-generation iPhone. The word is it’s going to be an ‘S’ model, meaning it’ll likely only feature internal changes.
* And a new report out of China this morning reaffirms that theory, claiming that components for the iPhone 5S will start shipping in Q3 of this year. It’s believed that the handset will offer an upgraded camera and processor, among other improvements…
* DigiTimes reports:
* “Components for the next-generation iPhone will start shipping at the end of May with the new smartphone to have a chance of showing up in the third quarter, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.
* The sources pointed out that if the components are all shipped smoothly, manufacturers should be able to deliver the new iPhones to retail channels in 1-2 weeks for them to be ready to sell in the third quarter.
* The iPhone 5S is expected to feature a higher-end processor as well as higher-megapixel camera modules, the sources said.”
* While it’s true that DigTimes is notorious for its hit-or-miss track record, it’s worth pointing out that the outlet has also been right on a number of occasions. Besides, today’s report falls in line with pretty much everything we’ve heard about the 5S to this point.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and iMore’s Rene Ritchie—both of whom have been fairly accurate in the past—are both reporting that the 2013 iPhone will land sometime during the summer, featuring an improved camera system and other spec bumps.
* Other reports have suggested that Apple is planning on using its newly acquired AuthenTec technology, adding both NFC and a fingerprint sensor to the new iPhone. And Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty promises the handset will offer at least one “killer feature.”
* In addition to the iPhone 5S, Apple is also said to be working on a sub-$300 handset that’s expected to launch later this year. DigiTimes’ report actually mentions the device, but refers to it as a ‘rumor,’ suggesting it hasn’t seen any supply chain evidence of it yet.
