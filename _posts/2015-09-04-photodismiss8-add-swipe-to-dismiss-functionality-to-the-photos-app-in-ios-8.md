* iOS 9 introduces a whole host of new subtle characteristics to the OS, such as swipe-to-dismiss functionality for photo previews in the Camera app. Today, a developer has released a new tweak that brings a similar swipe-to-dismiss gesture to the stock Photos app in iOS 8.
* Simply entitled PhotoDismiss8, this tweak is now available for download via developer Andrew Wiik’s beta repo. To find out how to add Wiik’s beta repo and try PhotoDismiss8 for yourself, read on.

* Since PhotoDismiss8 isn’t on the stock Cydia repos (yet), you’ll first need to add the third-party repo to your list of Cydia sources. The repo address is as follows:
* http://repo.andrewwiik.me
* Once you add the beta repo, perform a search for PhotoDismiss8, or simply open the repo section directly and find the tweak and install.

* After tweak installation, PhotoDismiss should start working immediately. There are no options to configure or settings to adjust. Just open the stock Photos app, open a photo, and swipe down on it to dismiss it and return to your album.
* One thing that I should mention is that this only appears to work in the Albums tab. I tried the same swipe down gesture under the Photos tab to no avail. I’m not sure if this was intentionally done, or if it’s just a symptom of the tweak being so early in development.
* Whatever the case may be, PhotoDismiss8 is a tweak that I think many of you will enjoy. It’s such a subtle gesture, but every little microsecond of time counts and eventually adds up to something significant.
* What do you think about PhotoDismiss8?
