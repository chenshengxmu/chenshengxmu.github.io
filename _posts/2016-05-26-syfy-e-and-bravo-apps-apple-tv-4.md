* Syfy Now’s lineup includes drama “The Magicians,” thriller “12 Monkeys” and the network’s long-running reality show “Face Off.” The E! Now app features fan-favorite “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and other unscripted fare including “Botched,” “#RichKids of Beverly Hills,” Caitlyn Jenner’s “I Am Cait” with and “WAGS” (available May 27).
