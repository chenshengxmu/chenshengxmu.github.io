* Available on App Store free of charge, Primate Labs’ refreshed Geekbench app now lets you measure the performance of mobile GPUs in iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac devices. Geekbench 4.1 brings a new Compute Benchmark to iOS and macOS. Written using Apple’s new graphics API, Metal, it measures the performance of the GPU at executing common compute tasks such as image processing and computational photography.
* Geekbench 4.1 also packs in improved support for Ryzen processors and fixes memory leaks in OpenCL workloads, a crash that could occur on Skylake-E processors and crashes that could occur when running Compute Benchmarks on low-end GPUs.

* Users can expect a two percent increase in single-core scores, at least a five percent increase in multi-core scores, a 35 percent increase in RenderScript scrores and a five percent increase in OpenCL and CUDA scores due to the following changes to the CPU and compute workloads:
* Developers recommend against comparing Geekbench 4.0 scores with Geekbench 4.1 scores. “While comparing overall scores may provide a rough approximation, comparing individual workload scores is strongly discouraged,” they noted.
* They won’t make any workload changes in future versions of the app so Geekbench 4.1 scores should be comparable against scores from all future releases of Geekbench.
* Download Geekbench 4.1 on App Store.
* Geekbench 4.1 for macOS is a direct download from the Primate Labs website.
