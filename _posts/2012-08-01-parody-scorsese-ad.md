* Last week, Apple started airing a new Siri commercial featuring the popular film director Martin Scorsese. The ad was the fourth in a string of celebrity spots focused on the digital assistant.
* Unsurprisingly, a parody video has just been made to poke fun at the ad. You’ve seen “The Samuel L. Jackson ad you were hoping for.” Now, here’s “Scorsese’s alternate iPhone commercial…”
* Admittedly, this parody isn’t as funny as some of the other ones we’ve seen. But the message is pretty clear: Siri sucks. And this isn’t just being said by amateur mashup clips. It’s also being said by iPhone 4S owners who have filed class-action lawsuits due to their disappoint with digital assistant, and research analysts.
* During WWDC this year, Apple announced that it was going to be rolling out a number of major updates to Siri this fall. Here’s hoping that holds true, as the competition is really starting to heat up.
