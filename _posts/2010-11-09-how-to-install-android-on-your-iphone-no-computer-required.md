* We’ve seen our share of guides on how to install Android on the iPhone before. They’re not terribly complicated, but they’re not that straightforward either. Most importantly, they aren’t as easy as installing an app as they usually require a computer to complete the install process.
* This is now a thing of the past. With the release of Bootlace 2.1, you can now install iDroid on your iPhone without the need of a computer! All you need is a jailbroken iPhone and a couple minutes of your time…
* The downside is that you won’t be able to install Android on any type of iPhone. So far, these are the only supported models
* Additionally,your device has to be jailbroken using one of these 3 jailbreak tools:
* If you fit the prerequisites, then install the following repo http://repo.neonkoala.co.uk and install Bootlace from it. A new icon will be added to your springboard from which you’ll be able to install OpeniBoot and iDroid.
* You’ll then have a dual boot iPhone. I wasn’t able to verify this whole process myself but a couple tipsters told me good things about it. If you do give this a shot, make sure to let us know how it’s working out for you.
