* With Apple’s annual World Wide Developer Conference now just a few weeks away, it’s hard not to get at least a little excited. After all, the Cupertino company is expected to show off new versions of OS X and iOS during its WWDC keynote.
* And it looks like we’ll be seeing that keynote on Monday, June 10. In an unsurprising move this morning, Apple has confirmed that it will be making all of its big announcements on the first day of WWDC at the Moscone Center in San Francisco…
* AllThingsD reports:
* “Apple today said the keynote address for its annual Worldwide Developers Conference will occur on Monday, June 10, at Moscone Center in San Francisco. Not a big surprise, as that is the day the event kicks off.”
* The company han’t revealed who the speakers will be, or their agenda, but it is widely presumed that CEO Tim Cook will take the stage with other members of Apple’s executive team to talk about new versions of their desktop and mobile OSes.
* Of course, with the way things have been going, anything can happen. Apple broke tradition this year by not launching a new product in the spring, so it’s possible it could be showing off new hardware next month as well. iPhone? iWatch? Maybe.
* But even without hardware, this WWDC keynote should prove interesting. We’ve heard a number of reports now that iOS 7 will be receiving quite the overhaul thanks to new leader of Human Interaction, Jony Ive. Apparently, he’s pushing for ‘flat’ design.
* Tickets for WWDC 2013 sold out in two minutes, an all-time record for the event. Previous keynotes have started at 10:00am PST, but the start time for this year’s presser hasn’t been set yet. Obviously, we’ll know more in a few weeks. Stay tuned.
