* 4chan founder Chris Poole’s DrawQuest app landed on the iPad in February 2013, taking DrawSomething believers by surprise.
* Similar to DrawSomething, DrawQuest taps your inner artist by issuing daily drawing challenges where you’re asked to complete incomplete drawings. The catch: you’re only allowed to use the tools provided. Novel concepts like DrawQuest and DrawSomething tend to blow up, fast.
* DrawQuest is no exception – the app’s amassed some pretty ardent following. Needless to say, fans have been clamoring for an iPhone version from day one and today Poole’s little enterprise has finally delivered.
* Yes, DrawQuest for iPhone (and iPod touch) is here and it’s brought with it some new features, including pinch-zooming on your canvas and the ability to create and share your own drawing quests…
* From the blurb:
* We’re pleased to announce that DrawQuest is now available for iPhone and iPod touch devices running iOS 7. We couldn’t be more excited about expanding the DrawQuest community to mobile devices. Drawing, browsing, and everything else has been reimagined for mobile, so be sure to check it out!
* It’s got a charming little app icon.

*  
* Other notable new features: zoomable canvas (use the pinch gesture), custom drawing quests shareable with friends and a new brush called Patty the Paint Can that colors the whole canvas in a cinch. Almost forgot: the app is now a universal binary and optimized for the flat iOS 7 appearance.
* Now, some folks may find the existing color scheme a little uninviting in iOS 7 (see the screenies below). I’d say it’s just a matter of personal taste. If you didn’t find the color choices in the iPad version distracting, you’ll feel right at home in DrawQuest 3.0.
