* Apple has acquired education-technology startup LearnSprout, reports Bloomberg. The outlet has received confirmation of the buyout with the boilerplate statement, “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.”
* Terms of the deal are not known at this time, but we do know that the San Francisco-based LearnSprout has raised more than $4 million from investors. The company specializes in education tracking and analytical software, which it has rolled out to more than 2,500 US schools.
* More specifically, LearnSprout aims to help schools unlock the data held in their legacy Student Information Systems. This allows educators to spot trends in crucial areas for their students such as attendance, college readiness, and even health during flu and other viral outbreaks.

* It’s not hard to imagine why Apple would want LearnSprout’s tech. The company has long shown interest in the education sector with its iPads, and recently committed to taking things to the next level with iOS 9.3. Expect the company to push deeper into this area in the coming years.
