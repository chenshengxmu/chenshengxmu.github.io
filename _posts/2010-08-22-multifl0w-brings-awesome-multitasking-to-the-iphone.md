title: Multifl0w Brings Awesome Multitasking to the iPhone
---
* We’ve talked about Multifl0w before, one the first jailbreak apps to give a multitasking UI to the iPhone. At the time, I wasn’t really a fan because I thought that ProSwitcher was a much better application. Things have changed a lot since then. Apple developed their own multitasking feature, and ProSwitcher was left for dead by its developer who recently said he will not update it.
* Multifl0w is back stronger than ever with a new and improved interface that now brings support for iOS 4 and the iPad. The app now shows up to 9 opened applications on the same screen for easy and quick task switching.
* What’s really nice about it is that Multifl0w can work alongside or completely replace Apple’s app switcher. You decide!
* You can get Multifl0w from Cydia for $4.99. If you download this application, please make sure to share your thoughts about it in the comments.
