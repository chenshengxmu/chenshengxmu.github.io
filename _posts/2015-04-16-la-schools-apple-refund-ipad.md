* The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) told Apple on Wednesday that it will not spend another dollar on the Pearson software installed on its iPads, reports local public radio station KPCC. Additionally, the school district is seeking a multimillion-dollar refund from the Cupertino giant for its failed technology initiative to put a tablet in the hands of each of its 650,000 students.
* “While Apple and Pearson promised a state-of-the-art technological solution for ITI [Instructional Technology Initiative] implementation, they have yet to deliver it,” David Holmquist, LAUSD’s attorney, wrote in a letter to Apple’s general counsel. “As we approach the end of the school year, the vast majority of students are still unable to access the Pearson curriculum on iPads,” he wrote.
* Apple made headlines in 2013 when it announced that it had reached a deal with the second largest school district in the country to distribute iPads to students using Pearson software. The program, however, has received mostly negative publicity since then, with reports of the FBI investigating the merits of the deal and students bypassing tablet security to play games and surf the web.
