* As a former Tweetbot user, there are some things I miss about that app, that I don’t get to have on the stock Twitter app. One of the most glaring omissions is the lack of quick list access directly from the main feed.
* Twitter++ (free on BigBoss) is a new jailbreak tweak that adds easy list access, along with a whole slew of other desirable features. It lets you easily share links and images from tweets, share tweets outside of twitter, share direct messages, download videos, and much, much more.
* If you’re looking to supercharge the stock Twitter app experience on iOS, then look no further than Twitter++.
* I’m just going to list many of the features that Twitter++ brings to the table, because frankly it’s a ridiculous amount of new features.
* And that’s not even the fully exhaustive list of features.

* Once you install Twitter++, the modifications will appear within the Twitter app immediately. Twitter++ doesn’t feature a preference panel in the stock Settings app, but you are able to configure its settings via the Twitter app itself.
* No doubt you’ll find at least a handful of features in Twitter++ that you’ll find useful. As I stated, I really love having quick one-touch access to my lists, and I’m sure I’ll begin to appreciate many of its other features as I get used to having it installed on my iPhone.
* What feature from Twitter++ do you most enjoy?
