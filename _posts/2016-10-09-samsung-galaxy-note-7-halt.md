* Samsung has temporarily halted production of its troubled Galaxy Note 7, reports Korean news agency Yonhap. The move follows decisions made on Sunday by multiple carriers, including AT&T and T-Mobile, to stop offering new units as replacements for those affected by the recall.
* An anonymous source tells the outlet that the suspension in production is in cooperation with consumer safety regulators from South Korea, and various other countries, and that the measure includes a manufacturing plant in Vietnam that is responsible for global Note 7 shipments.
* Samsung Electronics Co. has temporarily suspended production of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, an official at a supplier for Samsung said Monday, amid a series of media reports that some Note 7 replacements have caught fire. 
* The halt is in cooperation with consumer safety regulators from South Korea, the United States and China, the official said on the condition of anonymity.
* Samsung began selling the Galaxy Note 7 in August, but in September it recalled 2.5 million units after a number of users reported their phones were catching fire while charging. Affected consumers were issued replacements, but last week reports surfaced that they too are catching fire.
