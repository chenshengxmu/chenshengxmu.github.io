* Ukrainian developers Readdle today released a significant update to PDF Expert for iOS—in my personal view, the most powerful PDF editor for iPhone and iPad.
* Briefly, PDF Expert 6.3 for iOS brings a real-life book experience with two-page view that’s excellent for reading magazines or bilingual books.

* You can now add cloud documents you access frequently to the app’s Favorites section where they’ll be easier to find. Conveniently, a new thumbnail view is now available for your cloud files so you can see an immediate preview without opening the file.

* With enhanced cloud file management, customers can drag and drop files within their cloud storage to another service. As an example, it is now possible to move that school project presentation you’ve been working on from your Google Drive account to your Dropbox.
* Even better, PDF Expert lets you move cloud files into a local folder on your device.
