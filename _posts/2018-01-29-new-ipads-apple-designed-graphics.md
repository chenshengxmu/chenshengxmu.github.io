* Apple is reportedly working on new iPads for a fall introduction that would feature in-house designed GPUs and custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips also designed by the company.
* Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, said today that a new iPad model, due to be released toward the end of the year, would have an Apple-designed graphics engine and an AI chip.
* “Apple’s move into GPUs crushed the business of Imagination Technologies, which had previously provided the GPUs for iOS devices,“ said the report.
* Last year, Apple designed its first mobile GPU for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X lines.
* The current iPad Pro models are powered by Apple’s A10X Fusion system-on-a-chip, which is a higher-clocked variant of iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion silicon featuring additional CPU cores, Imagination Technologies’ 50% faster PowerVR Series 7XT GT7600 Plus GPU and more.

* Mark’s report probably alludes to a next-generation iPad Pro.
* According to the rumor-mill, the next iPad Pro model is probably going to feature iPhone X-esque design and include advances like a TrueDepth sensor for depth-based capabilities like we saw with iPhone X: the Face ID facial recognition system, Animoji and more.
* For what it’s worth, the iOS 11.3 code references an unreleased “modern iPad.”
* As for the AI chip mentioned in Bloomberg’s report, I suspect Gurman is referring to Apple’s new Neural Engine which is embedded in its A11 Bionic chip powering the latest iPhones, not a separate piece of silicon just for artificial intelligence functions.
* The report also claimed that Apple would release three new Mac computers toward the end of this year that should apparently run its next-generation “T3” desktop coprocessor.
* “Apple is working on at least three updated Mac models with custom coprocessors for release as soon as this year, including updated laptops and a new desktop,” the author wrote.
* What do you make of this report?
