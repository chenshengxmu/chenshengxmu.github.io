* Reachability is a convenient way to make one-handed usage easier on Apple’s larger handsets; regrettably, the interface lacks any exciting characteristics.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called BounceReachability by iOS developer CydiaGeek aims to help with that problem. It applies an impressive new bounce effect to the Reachability interface any time it’s invoked, supplying you with something that’s both fun and quirky to look at.
* Just in case you overlooked what Reachability looked like before installing BounceReachability, the interface basically just slid down to the middle of the display, like so:

* After installing BounceReachability, everything becomes more exhilarating. Once the interface arrives at its furthest point at the bottom of the screen, it accumulates kinetic energy and then bounces back up again, like so:

* Sure, it’s just a cosmetic effect, but anyone who knows me knows that I’ve always liked tweaking iOS animations. Personally, I fancy when my iPhone looks and behaves differently than everyone else’s through everyday use, and this is a tweak that can fill that desire.
* Because I have a Plus-sized handset, this is an animation mod that I’d see whenever trying to accomplish tasks with just one hand, which is mostly every day. That said, anyone who uses Reachability as regularly as I do will get to see the animation frequently.
* If you’re in the same boat as me and pained with the lousy stock animation, then now is a great time to give it some character. BounceReachability is a free download from Cydia, but you’ll have to add a third-party repository to Cydia to get it. These steps will assist you in doing that:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* Once you perform all four steps, you can locate and install BounceReachability by searching Cydia or reviewing the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
* Without any options to configure, the tweak couldn’t be any more straightforward, and it can make any Reachability-enabled device that’s jailbroken on iOS 10 more fun to use.
