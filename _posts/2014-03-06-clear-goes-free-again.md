title: Clear goes free one last time so you can migrate from Clear+ to Clear

* In an attempt to fix the confusing mess surrounding seemingly same versions of its to-do app for the iPhone and iPad, Clear and Clear+, developer Realmac Software last month announced it would make the former app temporarily free so people who previously bought Clear+ could migrate to Clear without having to purchase that app, too.
* Making true on its promise, Realmac on February 27 slashed Clear to $0. As the promotion ran for only 24 hours, not everyone was aware of the price cut. Those who missed their chance to save $4.99 by grabbing this nicely done gesture-driven app for zero bucks needn’t despair – Realmac has again made Clear free for the next 24 hours.
* What are you waiting for, get downloading…
* “Ever since the launch of Clear+, we’ve heard from customers that they are excited to pick up Clear but uncertain which version to buy,” Realmac said.
* Long story short, use Clear and not Clear+.
* Why?
* Because Clear+ is no longer supported, meaning it will no longer receive new updates. A Clear update is already in the works with reminders support so you’ll be missing out on that and other exciting new features if you decide to remain stuck on Clear+.
* I know Realmac’s move comes across confusingly, but it’s a logical workaround for Apple’s rules demanding that programmers eschew from charging additional money for app upgrades.
* If you’re wondering why all the fuss about yet another to-do app, check out Clear’s original launch promo video from two years ago.
* This is your last chance to get this premium app for free because Realmac’s open letter to users clearly states the promo would run “twice in the next few weeks”.
* Grab Clear free in the App Store for a limited time.
* The app normally sells for $4.99.
