* Hot off the heels of a Rollectra/SemiRestore11 update this Labor Day weekend, developer and ex-Electra Team member Pwn20wnd has released another update to the un-jailbreaking tool on Tuesday. The latest update brings the utility’s version number up to 1.1.2.-1.
* In case you’re in need of a refresher, the update that dropped on Labor Day weekend added support for iOS 11.3-11.4.X devices that had been jailbroken with Electra. Furthermore, it added a new option for un-jailbreaking your handset without losing your user data.
* Tuesday’s Rollectra/SemiRestore11 update is a minor follow-up to the update mentioned above that, according to Pwn20wnd, follows the “proper” procedure for restoring the device without losing user data. Furthermore, the process of un-jailbreaking without losing user data should be considered “safer” as of Rollectra/SemiRestore11 version 1.1.2-1.

* You can get Rollectra/SemiRestore11 one of two ways: 1) installing via Cydia, or 2) installing via side-loading. The former method is the most convenient and serves as an excellent option for those experiencing no trouble with their jailbreak. The latter option is considered a ‘jailed’ install and works best for those who are unable to get back into a jailbroken state.
* If you want to get it from Cydia, then you’ll need to add the Chariz/HASHBANG Productions repository to your list of Cydia sources. That repository URL is as follows:
* Alternatively, you can use any of the following download links to obtain and install the ‘jailed’ version of Rollectra/SemiRestore11:
* It shouldn’t matter which version you install, as they’re merely different means of achieving the same result.
* We’ve had some questions about why someone would want to use Rollectra/SemiRestore11, and it really comes down to the following scenarios:
* Keep in mind that Rollectra/SemiRestore11 version 1.1.2-1 does not yet support iOS 11.2.x. Pwn20wnd is working on adding support in the future, so stay tuned, and we’ll update everyone when the time comes.
