* No2Theft is a new jailbreak tweak release that helps you keep your iPhone from getting stolen when you plug it in for a quick charge in unfamiliar places.
* If you’ve ever been away from home and needed a quick charge, then you’ve probably been in this predicament before. You may have needed to plug your iPhone into a power outlet for some juice while you were at your job, at a restaurant, or even at a friend’s house.
* Unfortunately, you can’t always sit there and babysit your device the whole time because you have things to do, but it’s always on your conscience that someone might try to take your device while it’s charging.
* No2Theft is your possible solution to this problem. It lets you designate Wi-Fi networks that you consider “safe” networks, which might include the Wi-Fi network at your house. These are considered “safe” because at no point in time should anyone besides you be trying to disconnect your device from the power outlet when you’re charging in the vicinity of one of these networks.
* Whenever your iPhone isn’t connected to one of these “safe” networks, such as when you’re at someone else’s house or when you’re at work, and it gets disconnected from its power source, No2Theft is going to play a loud alarm that everyone’s going to be able to hear.
* You can probably imagine where it goes from here… you’ve just caught the iPhone lifter red-handed at this point.
* So couldn’t someone just mute the alarm? Well… it’s not really that easy. When the alarm is going off, the tweak will not allow the alarm to be muted with the silent switch and you can’t reduce the volume using the volume buttons.
* The only way to silence the alarm would be to unlock your iPhone and authenticate yourself with your Touch ID sensor or with a special PIN that you configure.
* To configure your safe Wi-Fi networks and set a PIN after installing the tweak, you can go to Settings → No2Theft.

* You can set up to three safe Wi-Fi networks and enable or disable the tweak on demand. You set Wi-Fi networks by simply typing in their network names (SSID). You will need to tap on the blue Apply Changes button any time you make changes here, and that will respring your device.
* Overall, this tweak provides a great potential for catching would-be thieves red-handed. If you’re interested in trying this tweak, you can download it on your jailbroken device for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak will work on iOS 7 through iOS 9.
