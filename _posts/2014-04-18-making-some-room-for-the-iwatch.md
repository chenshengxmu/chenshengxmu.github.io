title: Nike gives up on the FuelBand, making more room for the iWatch
---
* Nick Statt, reporting for CNET:
* Nike is gearing up to shutter its wearable-hardware efforts, and the sportswear company this week fired the majority of the team responsible for the development of its FuelBand fitness tracker, a person familiar with the matter told CNET.
* As early as this fall, Nike planned on releasing another iteration of the FuelBand — an even slimmer version — but cancelled the project, and it appears to have shelved all future physical product projects under the Digital Sport helm, the person familiar with the matter added.
* One might argue it never really made sense for a shoe maker to build hardware. Still, it’s an interesting move, at an interesting time, especially when you know Tim Cook is on Nike’s board.
