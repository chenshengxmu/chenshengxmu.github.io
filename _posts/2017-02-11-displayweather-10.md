* While the Lock screen and Notification Center have each become much more functional and informative in some of the latest versions iOS, it’s still possible to improve on them, and jailbreak developers are taking note of this.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called DisplayWeather 10 by pxcex puts your weather information to the left of the date information in each of these interfaces, letting you dedicate the space that would normally be taken up by the weather widget to other widgets instead.
* DisplayWeather 10 utilizes the information that your iPhone’s stock Weather app receives based on your current location, so to use this tweak, you will need to have Location Services enabled for Weather. This tweak will not work for locations that you’ve set manually.
* When you do have Location Services enabled for Weather, the tweak uses the space that’s normally empty on the left side of the header in the widget interface on both the Lock screen and Notification Center to show you weather information for your location.
* As you can see above, the tweak works in Notification Center, but below, you can also see it working from the Lock screen in the interface that you can access by swiping right:

* The tweak includes the name of your location, the weather conditions outside, and even a large weather illustration for visual purposes.
* The first thing that might come to mind for some of you is, “but iOS already has a weather widget, so why install this?”
* For me, the answer is that I have limited screen space and I want to see as much information as possible. If I can install this tweak and hide the Weather widget, then that leaves more screen space for other widgets that I can see at a glance without scrolling.
* While others may disagree, it’s all in good fun. The point of jailbreaking is to do what you want, how you want, on your own device without Apple’s say-so.
* If you’re interested in downloading and trying DisplayWeather 10 on your jailbroken device, you can do so right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak only works on iOS 10 devices.
