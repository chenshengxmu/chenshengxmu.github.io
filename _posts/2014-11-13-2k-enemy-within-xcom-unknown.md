* 2K games this morning released XCOM: Enemy Within for iOS, an expansion for its popular turn-based military sim XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Fans of the franchise will recognize the title, as it was released to PCs and consoles around this time last year.
* 2K is calling Enemy Within a “standalone expansion” due to the fact that it features the core gameplay of Enemy Unknown, and builds on its storyline, but it’s a completely separate app. You do not need one of the games installed in order to play the other.

* If you’re a fan of the XCOM franchise, or of the turn-based strategy/alien invasion genre, you’re probably going to want to add this game to your get list.  Admittedly, it’s quite a bit more expensive than your average iOS game, but this is clearly not Flappy Bird.
* It looks like 2K has pulled the original XCOM: Enemy Unknown from the App Store, seemingly positioning today’s release as more of a replacement or sequel. If you want to check it out, XCOM: Enemy Within is available for both iPhone and iPad for $12.99.
