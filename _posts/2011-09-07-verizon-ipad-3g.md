* In a new ad by Verizon, the iPad 2’s 3G functionality is showcased. This is very unusual because iPad ads are usually produced by Apple.
* The ad shows a person using their iPad in different environments, from the beach to the forrest. It also showcases Twitter and downloading books on the go…
* Verizon always showcases their Android tablets, but never the iPad.. that is, until now.
* Do you find the 3G iPad to be more useful for you with its constant connectivity, or is the WiFi-only iPad enough?
