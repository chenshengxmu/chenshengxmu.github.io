* Apple has expanded its iTunes Match service to several new European countries this week. Users in Finland, Denmark, Sweden and other areas are reporting that they have been granted access to the music-mirroring service.
* First introduced in late 2011, iTunes Match allows users to match songs from their iTunes libraries to tracks in Apple’s cloud. This way they can access their music from any device, without having to spend hours uploading it…
* MacRumors reports:
* “Apple has recently expanded iTunes Match availability to several Nordic countries, according to both reports on Twitter and tip from a MacRumors reader. iTunes users in Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden now have access to the service, which has a yearly price of 249 kr in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway and €24.99 in Finland. 
* Additionally, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have recently gained access to Music in the Cloud, which allows users to access previously purchased music on any device, and Bulgaria and Portugal now have Movies in the Cloud.
* iTunes Match runs $24.99 per year in the United States, and £21.99 in the U.K. And the fee not only covers the service, but also removes ads in iTunes Radio. For more information about International iTunes Match availability, click here.
