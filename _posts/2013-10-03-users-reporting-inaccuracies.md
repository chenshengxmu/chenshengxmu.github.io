* Heads up iPhone 5s owners: have you noticed that your Compass app readings are a little bit off? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. It seems a number of users are complaining of inaccurate sensors on Apple’s latest handset.
* More specifically, users have noticed that both their compass and inclinometers on their 5s devices are consistently off by a noticeable margin. The latter appears to be incorrect by 2 degrees, while the former is off by 8-10…
* Gizmodo reports:
* “Since the iPhone 5S landed in the hands of new owners a few weeks ago, there have been reports that on-board sensors like the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer haven’t been working properly on some devices. We’ve confirmed the new iPhone’s failings on our own. It’s not just off. It’s embarrassing. 
* We tested two iPhone 5S units running the latest version of iOS 7 against the iPhone 5, as well as against real-world measuring tools to find out if the new iPhone’s sensors are off, and if they are, by how much. In most cases, we used the iPhone’s built-in iOS 7 apps for measurements, working under the assumption that Apple would properly calibrate its hardware to work with the software of its own design. We were wrong.”
* MacRumors adds to the narrative, noting that a twenty-page thread has popped up on its forums full of similar reports claiming that the compass and level are off. And there are also several threads on Apple’s Support website.
* So what next? Well, that depends on if this is a hardware or software issue. If it’s a software issue, then Apple could simply fix things with a future firmware release. But if it’s hardware, that would be significantly harder to correct.
* Either way it’s a problem—and one that doesn’t just affect folks looking to hang a picture or shelf. Think about all of the different apps and games there are that use the iPhone’s accelerometer and some of its other sensors.
* Have you noticed any issues with the sensors on your iPhone 5s?
