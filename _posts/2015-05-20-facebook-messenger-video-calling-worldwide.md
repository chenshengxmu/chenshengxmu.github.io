* Facebook confirmed today that free video calling in its mobile Messenger application has begun rolling out to all users worldwide. The feature launched in select markets on April 27, 2015.
* “Quick update on video calling in Messenger: we’re happy to share we’ve now rolled out the capability globally, with the exception of a few countries we’re still working on improving quality for,” David Marcus, Messaging at Facebook, wrote in a post on Facebook this morning.
* High quality video calling is available in the mobile Messenger app via a dedicated phone icon in the upper right corner of the chat interface, allowing you to easily start a video call right from within an existing Messenger conversation.
* Video calling is cross-platform so Apple users are permitted to engage in face-to-face conversations with their Android friends, and vice versa.
* Last week, Facebook partnered with select publishers and media outlets on fast-loading, iPhone-exclusive Instant Articles in the main mobile client.
