* Samsung’s much-talked-about anti-iPhone campaign dubbed ‘Wall Huggers’ is expanding to select airports, which are among the most trafficked public spots and traditionally the domain of iPhone and MacBook-toting users.
* After poking fun of the iPhone’s appalling battery performance with its controversial 30-second television spot, the South Korean conglomerate is now displaying Galaxy S5 ads at power outlets throughout major airports.
* The posters advertises the Galaxy S5’s Ultra Power Saving mode and features a tagline saying “So you have the power to be anywhere but here” in a not-so-subtle dig at Apple’s iPhone 5s campaign which revolves around the tagline “You’re more powerful than you think”…
* As reported by CNET, Samsung is now trolling iPhone users around power outlets at select airports.
* Samsung tells me that these angst-inducing ads will be gracing John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, , as well as Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway airports. They may also appear at other airports.
* And here’s Samsung’s poster, taken by MacRumors reader Harrison Weinerman in Terminal C at the Newark airport in New Jersey on August 10.

* I think Samsung’s campaign hits a nerve.
* The iPhone can certainly be bashed for its sub-par battery performance, sub-par relative to jumbo-sized Android handsets that have much stronger batteries.
* As a quick reminder, here’s Samsung’s ‘Wall Huggers’ TV spot.

* Perhaps unsurprisingly, an internal research told Apple that early iPhone 5 adopters wanted, first and foremost, a longer-lasting battery. Many other surveys have since corroborated the notion.
* For example, a survey of 1,000 smartphone users conducted by uSell.com and publicized earlier today by BGR has reiterated that a stronger battery life is what iPhone users seem to be craving more than anything else.
* Specifically, 37 percent of respondents (nearly four out of each ten people) wanted an improved iPhone battery versus just 19 percent who said they wanted the iPhone to get a bigger display.
* And, in our own little non-scientific poll focused on the stronger battery vs. bigger screen dilemma, the vast majority of respondents opted for a longer-lasting battery.
* Are you a wall hugger?
* Does your iPhone last through the day or do you need to carry an external battery pack around with you?
