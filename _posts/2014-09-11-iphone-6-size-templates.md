* On its website, Apple says that the iPhone 6 is 5.44 inches (138.1 mm) tall, 2.64 inches wide and 0.27 inches thick. The larger iPhone 6 Plus is 6.22″ x 3.06″ x 0.28″. These numbers are great, but they don’t really give you a good idea of how big these devices actually are, so we decided to try something else.
* Some templates have been floating around the web for the past few days, showing skeleton models of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus using the above dimensions. The idea is for you to print these models out and compare them to other items, and we thought a good point of reference for scale would be the iPhone 5s.
* Here is the iPhone 6 (which has a 4.7-inch display) template compared to an iPhone 5s:
* Admittedly, it’s not the best photo, but it should give you an idea of how the size of an iPhone 6 compares to the 5s. It’s worth noting that I have lined up the very bottom of both devices—not their displays—as I felt that this would give me a more accurate look at the difference in the total footprint of each handset.

* Now, here’s the iPhone 6 Plus (with a 5.5-inch display) template compared to the iPhone 5s:

* Oh yeah, it’s big. You can almost fit the entire body of the iPhone 5s within the display area of the 6 Plus. I’ve heard from people around the web who’ve seen the device up close say that it’s about the size of a checkbook, and that seems about right. It definitely looks like most tasks are going to require 2 hands.
* For those of you who want to try this little experiment out for yourself, you can find the templates for the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. It might just help you make your decision on which one to go with before you pre-order, which begins at 12:01 am tonight, or line up at Apple retail stores next Friday.
* Thanks Chris!
