title: Sony Fires a Shot at the iPhone Gaming Ability
---
* It seems as if someone at Sony feels threatened by the iPhone and its ability as a gaming device. I’m not sure why since it’s quite obvious that the device isn’t the first toy you think of when you hear about “serious gaming”.
* Nevertheless Sony has released a PSP commercial taking shots at what is obviously supposed to be an iPhone game. Kevin Butler (whose supposed iPhone has a game titled ‘Lame Castle’ on its screen) and young Marcus Rivers are featured in what is actually a pretty funny clip. Rivers tells Butler  that his phone is for “texting your grandma and calling your girl” and that it can’t handle “big boy games”.
* Engadget has the full video that informs us that the PSP has games as low as $9.99. It’s an amusing little clip but why Sony feels the need to compare its PSP to the iPhone games is a bit bewildering.
* I don’t know about you but when I play a game on my iPhone, it is usually to just pass time here and there. Never have I considered it to be a gamer’s device of choice. Is this just friendly banter from Sony or a bit of desperation? Give us your opinion in the comments right after you text your grandma.
