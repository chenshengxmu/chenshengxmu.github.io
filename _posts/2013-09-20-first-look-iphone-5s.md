* I was so angry when I woke up this morning, because I woke up late, and I just knew that meant I wasn’t going to get an iPhone 5s. Much to my surprise, my local Verizon store had plenty in stock, albeit, none were gold.
* I was able to walk in, say I wanted an unlocked iPhone 5s, and walked out in less than 15 minutes. It was an overall uneventful experience, despite my tardiness.
* I decided to go ahead and go with the 32GB Space Gray iPhone 5s. While initially I kind of dismissed this color option, it’s not half bad when you see it in person. In fact, I think it’s safe to say that this is the best looking iPhone ever, outside of maybe the Gold model if that’s your thing.
* Of course I’ll have many more videos to follow throughout the day, which will detail the new features, my thoughts, and experiences. In the meantime, share your launch day stories below. Were you able to grab an iPhone 5s? If so, what color and size?
