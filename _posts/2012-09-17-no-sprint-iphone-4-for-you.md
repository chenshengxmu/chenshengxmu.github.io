* When Apple unveiled its new smartphone last week, it also announced some changes to its iPhone lineup. For starters, the 16GB iPhone 4S is going to drop to just $99 with a two year contract.
* In addition, the company is also getting rid of the 3GS, making the iPhone 4 its $0 offering. But according to some new information, it doesn’t look like all providers are going to carry it…
* 9to5Mac reported earlier this evening that Sprint is going to be removing the iPhone 4 from its lineup starting September 21st, the same day that the above-mentioned pricing is to go into effect.
* We can now confirm the information, as iDB has gotten its hands on Sprint’s internal iPhone 5 Launch Guide. In it, the carrier tells its employees that the iPhone 4 will be removed from its Planogram, or pricing catalogue, this week with “more information and instructions” to follow soon.
* There’s a good chance that Sprint is removing the handset because it can’t afford to eat the $500+ subsidy on each one. Remember, Sprint is the last of the big three carriers offering unlimited data.
* Apple did say that the free iPhone 4 would only be available on select carriers. So it’ll be interesting to see how this all shakes down over the next few weeks, at Sprint and at other wireless providers.
