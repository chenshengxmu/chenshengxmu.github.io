* Tim Cook and company just took the wraps off of the next version of its mobile operating system, iOS 7. And as expected, it’s by far the biggest update to the platform since the original iPhone launched back in 2007.
* What’s different? Everything. In line with previous reports and speculation, Apple has completely redesigned the OS from the ground up with an all new user interface and a slew of new features. And honestly, it looks amazing…
* Wow, where to even start here. Obviously, we’ll be going into specific features in more detail in subsequent posts, but I’m going to do my best to give a nice overview of some of the sweeping changes in the new software.

* First, there’s the Lock screen. As you can see, it’s been completely redone with a much more minimalistic design. The ‘slide to unlock’ slider is now transparent, the Camera grabber has been moved to the bottom righthand corner, and it now supports animated backgrounds. Bonus: the Notification Center can now be accessed from the Lock Screen.

* And now the Home screen. Notice how the icons have all been redone (and are remarkably close to the leak we saw last night), and there are now Settings toggles available with a swipe up from the bottom of the screen. The new Home screen looks vibrant, and Apple says it’s added a ton of new features.
* And some more screenshots:
