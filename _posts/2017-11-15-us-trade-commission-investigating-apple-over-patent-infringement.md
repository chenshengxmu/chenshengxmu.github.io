* Reuters reported Tuesday that the US Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into Apple for potential patent infringement.
* So far, information is scarce, but the commission said that the complaint was submitted by Aqua Connect Inc and Strategic Technology Partners of Orange, Ca. That complaint seemed legitimate enough for them to start an investigation into the patent infringement on Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Apple TVs.
