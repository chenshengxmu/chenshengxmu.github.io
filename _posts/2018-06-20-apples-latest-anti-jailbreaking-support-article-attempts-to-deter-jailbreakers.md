* Jailbreaking your iPhone or iPad has long been considered a taboo practice by Apple, the manufacturer of these handsets. And now an updated support page published on the Cupertino-based company’s website discourages jailbreaking in its entirety.
* The page, updated on June 15th, targets a bevy of potential side-effects from jailbreaking your device. These include, but aren’t limited to:
* While the page raises valid points about the potential hazards of jailbreaking iOS devices, the narrative is designed to discourage jailbreak attempts by those who might be considering it for themselves.
* Expectedly, the article makes no attempt to highlight the benefits of jailbreaking. After all, Apple doesn’t want you to do it in the first place.
* At the very end of the article, Apple reiterates how they reserve the right to refuse warranty related services on modified devices that violate your terms of service agreement. Obviously, it’s nothing we haven’t heard from Apple before, as jailbreaking has been around for many years.
* Apple continues to prevent jailbreaking from every angle by building security features such as Kernel Patch Protection (KPP) into modern versions of iOS that make it more challenging for hackers to develop tools. The upcoming iOS 12 release will be no different, although KeenLab has already demonstrated a working jailbreak on the first iOS 12 beta.
* Obviously, this article won’t keep avid jailbreakers from taking control of their own devices, but it’s interesting to see Apple’s renewed interest in kicking the jailbreak community during a time of intensified involvement by experienced security researchers like Ian Beer and renowned jailbreak developers like CoolStar and Jonathan Levin, among others.
