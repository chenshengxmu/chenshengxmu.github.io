* I find Tweetbot to be “over designed,” meaning its user interface it’s too heavy for my eyes. I hear it’s still people’s favorite Twitter app for iPhone though, so they must definitely be doing something right.
* Today, Tweetbot was updated to version 2.0, bringing the following new features:
* You can download Tweetbot from the App Store for $2.99.
* If you ask me, I’ll tell you that I’ll stick to SimplyTweet, which has been my favorite Twitter iPhone app for a while now.
