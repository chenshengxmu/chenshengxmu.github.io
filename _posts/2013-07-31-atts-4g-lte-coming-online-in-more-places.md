* Just a week after adding seven new markets, the nation’s second-largest telco today announced its fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless service is now available in an additional ten U.S. cities.
* With Verizon’s LTE now blanketing 500+ markets, AT&T certainly has some catching up to do. Customers in select cities located in the U.S. states of Oklahoma, Massachusets, Georgia, Arkansas and West Virginia should start experiencing increased download speeds using their LTE-enabled gear…
* The new LTE markets are as follows:
* • Rome and Cedartown, Georgia • Charleston, West Virginia • Ardmore and Ada, Enid, Durant and Ponca City, Oklahoma • Marthas Vineyard, Massachusets • Russellville and Arkadelphia, Arkansas – Russellville coverage now includes parts of Atkins, Damascus, Dardanelle, London, Morrilton, Plumerville, Pottsville and surrounding communities. Arkadelphia coverage includes parts of Caddo Valley, Friendship, Gum Springs, Malvern, Poyen, Saginaw, Social Hill and surrounding communities.
* Here’s what LTE does for you.
* By the way, the telco activated 3.6 million iPhones during the June quarter, which also saw a net addition of  551,000 postpaid subscribers and $32 billion in revenues.
* In other news, Iris – a mobile payment joint venture between AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon –  is set to go nationwide later this year with iPhone support.
* And earlier in the week, the carrier announced a brand new home telephony service that works over its LTE and HSPA networks – and I’m not even mentioning their acquisition of the regional carrier Long Lines Wireless.
