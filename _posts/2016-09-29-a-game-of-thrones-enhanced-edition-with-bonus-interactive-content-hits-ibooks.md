* The first book in George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” fantasy series was published twenty years ago today. Celebrating the anniversary, publisher HarperCollins and Apple released interactive “Game of Thrones” digital books on the iBooks Store today.
* Representing “an amazing next step in the world of books,” The Guardian reports that the enhanced electronic books bring “a world of additional content” such as sigils, family trees and glossaries.
* “Navigate the astounding world of Westerns with the enhanced editions of George R. R. Martin’s magnificent series,” reads a blurb on the iBooks Store.
* “Available only on iBooks, they’re the best way to read this thrilling epic. Interactive maps, author notes, family trees and illustrations add to the adventure, whether you’re new to the books or speak fluent Dothraki,” writes Apple.
* Here are the download links:
* Each of the above books is enhanced with interactive content and includes an extract from the currently unfinished The Winds of Winter book.
* Four more enhanced editions will be released between October 27 and March 2017.
* The enhanced digital edition of the second novel in the series, A Clash of Kings, is scheduled for October 27. The enhanced edition of book three, A Storm of Swords, is due on December 15. The fourth and fifth books, A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons, will follow in February and March 2017.
* Announcing the new enhanced editions, Martin said:
* We’re now entering a new period in the history of publishing. The digital book gives readers the ability to experience all this rich secondary material that had not been possible before.
* These enhanced editions, available only on iBooks, include sigils and family trees and glossaries. Anything that confuses you, anything you want to know more about, it’s right there at your fingertips. It’s an amazing next step in the world of books.
* I’m a big fan of the Game of Thrones series.
* I haven’t read the actual books yet (I know, SHAME on me), but these enhanced editions surely are a terrific idea. I’m all for interactivity and will be buying the whole enhanced series to keep myself entertained in the coming weeks and months.
