title: Music Widget now available on Cydia
---
* Music Widget, the Dashboard X compatible music interface that we previewed a couple of days ago, has now appeared for download on Cydia.
* Music Widget allows you to view your “now playing” album art, along with placing play/pause, skip, and previous buttons conveniently near the bottom of the interface.
* Take a look at our full walkthough, and head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo to download it for free. What do you think?
