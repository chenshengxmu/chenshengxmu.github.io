* Fortune Editor Adam Lashinsky is releasing a book next week entitled Inside Apple. The book is expected to contain several secrets regarding the Mac-making company that aren’t currently considered public knowledge.
* Excerpts from the title have been spilling out onto the web over the last few days. Yesterday, we told you that the book taps iOS executive Scott Forstall as Apple’s next CEO. And today, a story has surfaced regarding Eddy Cue…
* Cue is current a Senior Vice President at Apple, in charge of iTunes, iBooks, the App Store, iCloud, and several other areas. You may recognize him from Apple’s iPhone event last October as the one who introduced the Find My Friends app.
* But according to Inside Apple, Cue’s abilities reach far beyond project management. The book describes Eddy as Apple’s “deal-making executive,” who has handled licensing deals for everything from iTunes to iCloud. He even reportedly led initial iPhone negotiations with AT&T — a task most folks have attributed to Jobs.
* To learn more about Eddy Cue and his role at Apple, you can pick up Inside Apple when it goes on sale January 25th.
