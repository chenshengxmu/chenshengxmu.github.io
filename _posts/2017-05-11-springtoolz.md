* Looking to spice up your Home screen a little bit more? A new free jailbreak tweak called SpringToolz by iOS developer Stoyan Stoyanov lets you change the shape of your Home screen icons, add drop shadows, and much more.
* The tweak comes loaded with a vast number of shape options to choose from and can give your device that distinct appearance you’re looking for to make it stand out from the rest.
* SpringToolz puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure your app icon shape settings to your liking:

* Here, you have three different sections to configure. The first deals with changing the shape of the Home screen icons, the second deals with changing the shape of the Dock icons, and the third deals with adjusting the drop shadow options.

* There are numerous shapes to choose from and because they’re applied as an icon mask, they’ll continue showing off the icon as it was meant to be portrayed without cutting out important details. That said, you won’t have any issues distinguishing one app from another post-installation.
* The drop shadow, love it or hate it, can help make the icons pop against the wallpaper you’re using. If the default black drop shadow doesn’t work well with the wallpaper you’re using, you can choose custom shadow colors to help reduce color conflicts.
* When you’re finished configuring the tweak’s settings, all you need to do is go to the main preferences pane and tap on the Apply button to respring your device.
* If you’re interested in giving SpringToolz a try, you can grab it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
