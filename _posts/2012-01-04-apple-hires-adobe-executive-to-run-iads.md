title: Apple Hires Adobe Executive to Run iAds
---
* Apple reportedly hired Adobe executive Todd Teresi to run the iAds business unit, which had been ran by Eddie Cue since August, when Andy Miller stepped down to join a VC firm:
* Apple has poached Adobe executive Todd Teresi to run its iAds program, Adam Satariano at Bloomberg reports.
* According to LinkedIn, Teresi is a VP and GM of Media Solutions at Adobe. Prior to that he was Chief Revenue Officer at Quantcast. (Before that, he was SVP at Yahoo.)
* We wish him good luck. Given the moderate success of iAds, heâ€™ll certainly need it.
