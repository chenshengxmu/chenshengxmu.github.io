* If you suffer from outdoor or seasonal allergies, then you know how difficult it can be. You need to be prepared for that certain time of year and those high counts in air.
* Having an allergy app on your mobile device can help. You can see what’s coming and what’s happening at the moment. Plus, if your allergies seem to be changing over time, you can see what’s in the air causing your sniffles.
* Here are a few of the things we looked for when creating this list of allergy apps for iOS.

* For a quick and simple view of the allergy counts for the day, Pollen.com’s Allergy Alert is a good choice. You can see the current allergy forecast for the day and upcoming days with counts and small graphs. Right next to that, you can see the weather forecast for the day with highs and lows, precipitation chance, wind, and humidity.
* Pollen.com’s Allergy Alert is a great app for giving you the allergy details you really need at a glance.
