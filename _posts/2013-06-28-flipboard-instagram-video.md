* Flipboard users will be happy to hear that the app has just been updated with support for Instagram’s new video feature. Facebook’s popular video sharing service can now capture and post video clips up to 15-seconds in length.
* And with the latest Flipboard update, which brings the app to version 2.0.4, you can now open and view these videos within the application. The update also includes new ways to share magazines, and the usual array of bug fixes…
* Here’s your full 2.0.4 change log:
* – Reminder: Log in to Google Reader on Flipboard on or before June 30th to save your feeds and folders. – Now you can share to Twitter and Facebook when sharing to your magazines. – Bug fixes and improvements.
* Oddly enough, the added support of Instagram videos isn’t listed in the release notes. But like Josh Ong of The Next Web, I wasn’t seeing any videos from the social network in the app before the update. Now they open and play just fine.
* Also worth noting is the reminder to log in to your Google Reader account on Flipboard to save your feeds and folders. Google is scheduled to shut down the RSS service on Monday, and you’ll lose all of your stuff if you haven’t saved it.
* As usual, you can find Flipboard in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
