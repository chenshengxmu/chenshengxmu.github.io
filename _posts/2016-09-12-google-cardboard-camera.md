* Google today released a brand new camera application on the App Store, allowing iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users to take three-dimensional panoramas in 360-degree freedom. The interactive VR photography app is called Cardboard Camera and in addition to capturing 360-degree images, it also lets you share VR photos online and enjoy them in virtual reality with Google’s Cardboard and similar accessories along with VR photos taken by other people.
* “VR photos let you experience scenery and sound in every direction and in 3D, making near things look near, and far things look far,” says Google. “From vacation travels to family get-togethers, capture the moment with Cardboard Camera and relive it in VR.”
* To take a VR photo, hold the device in portrait orientation, tap the record button and turn around slowly as though you’re taking a panorama in the stock Camera app.
* After the image has been captured, tap the share icon and the app will generate a link that can be emailed, messaged, or posted in apps and on the web. You can even select multiple photos to create a virtual photo album.
* The app originally debuted on Android, with more than five million VR moments having been captured with Cardboard Camera on Android. With today’s release, iOS users can now capture VR photos and “relive those moments as if they were there,” too.
* More information is available at the Google VR website.
* Download Cardboard Camera for free from the App Store.
