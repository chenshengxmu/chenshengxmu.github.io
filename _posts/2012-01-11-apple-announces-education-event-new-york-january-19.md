* Apple has officially announced its upcoming media event for January 19th. The previously-rumored event will focus on education and take place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City.
* It was speculated that Apple’s January event would revolve around education and textbooks, but Apple has only said that the event will be an “education announcement.”
* AllThingsD correctly predicted the date and nature of Apple’s upcoming event:
* If you want to start speculating — of course you do — it’s worth noting that none of the big textbook publishers are working with iBooks and Apple’s iOS ecosystem in any significant way, though Apple and the publishers have had on-and-off conversations for years. Perhaps some of that changes this month, or perhaps Apple pushes into education without working with the traditional players.
* It seems that Apple could be set to introduce a subscription service for textbooks, but there are many possibilities for the 19th’s announcement. Stay tuned to iDB for breaking coverage.
* What do you expect Apple to unveil next Thursday?
