title: Adobe Photoshop Touch video walkthrough
---
* As you may have heard, Adobe’s Photoshop Touch has been released officially for the iPad 2, and we’re happy to report that it looks very promising judging from our initial walkthrough.
* This is definitely one of the, if not the deepest photo editing apps we’ve ever used on a tablet, and I think the majority of Adobe fans and Photoshop users in general will be pleasantly surprised with the interface and design.
* Photoshop Touch is iPad 2 only, and can be purchased from the App Store for $9.99. Take a look and tell us what you think.
