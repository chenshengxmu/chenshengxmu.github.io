* Apple is again rumored to be working on a second-generation iPhone SE model that should release some time in the first half of next year.
* Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported Wednesday (Google Translate) that the smartphone will be assembled exclusively at Wistron’s factory in Bangalore, India.
* Wistron already assembles existing iPhone SE models in India.
* The new iPhone SE 2 will cost about $450 and will be aimed at sales in emerging markets, according to the report, which did not cite sources. Focus Taiwan said in August that a next-generation iPhone SE would be shipping in the first quarter of 2018.
* Prior rumors claimed that the tentatively named iPhone SE 2 will run Apple’s A10 Fusion chip like the iPhone 7 series and include 2GB of RAM, a larger 1,700 mAh battery, 32GB and 128GB storage capacities, a 12-megapixel camera out the back and a five-megapixel selfie shooter.
* The current iPhone SE, now starting at $349, runs Apple’s A9 chip and includes 2GB of RAM, a 12-megapixel rear camera, Touch ID and other features.
