* QuickEmoji is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to quickly access Emoji characters using the stock iOS keyboard. Normally, you’d have to switch to a dedicated Emoji keyboard to use Emoji characters, but this tweak takes on a more practical approach.
* Take a look on the inside, as we show you how to access your precious Emoji characters in a more efficient manner…
* Notice how on both the numeric keyboard, and the symbol keyboard, the row containing . , ? ! ‘ remains the same. Why not use that extra real estate for some alternate keys? That’s exactly what QuickEmoji does — it replaces that row of keys with Emoji icons.

* Notice how the third row of keys remain the same on the stock iPhone.
* That’s pretty much all QuickEmoji does, but it does it well. With that in mind, there are no options to configure in the Settings app, just install and go. As a bonus, if you tap and hold on one of the Emoji keys, a window featuring even more icons will pop up for your usage.
* QuickEmoji is available free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’re a big Emoji user with a jailbroken device, then QuickEmoji should be right up your alley. Although it doesn’t contain the full repertoire of Emoji symbols, there’s enough there to keep most entertained, don’t you think?
