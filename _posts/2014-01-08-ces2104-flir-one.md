* Avid iPhone photography fans are always on the lookout for new ways of improving their snaps and photography skills to give their work an added edge.
* Pitched as the world’s first private thermal imager, the Flir One case slides right onto your iPhone 5 and lets you “see the heat wherever you go”.
* It slides onto your iPhone like an ordinary protective case and displays the infrared world on its screen.
* We’re talking true thermal imaging here, not the kinds of fake infrared effects you see in many photography apps on the App Store…
* The infrared spectrum has a longer wavelength than visible light and the human eyes cannot see it. Like sophisticated security cameras, the Flir One case translates this invisible heat energy into dynamic images.
* Since all living beings emit heat, the case sees these heat signatures and tiny differences in temperature in complete darkness, allowing for interesting uses.
* Example uses: moisture detection (left) and energy efficiency (right).

* The companion Flir One MX app can provide handy temperature readings, save your captured shots to iOS Camera roll and share them on social media channels.
* You’ll be able to apply various effects (B/W, W/B, Rainbow, Contrast, Arctic, Hot/Cold and Iron), add visible spectrum detail to thermal images, get an at-a-glance overview of the case’s battery level and more.
* One caveat: shiny materials won’t play nice with the Flir One because these surfaces reflect their surroundings rather than generate their own heat signature.
* Here’s Flir One in action.

* I wonder if that’s Don Draper narrating…
* The Flir One includes a rechargeable 1,400mA/h battery that extends your iPhone’s battery life by 50 percent while powering the thermal imager for up to two hours.
* The company says consumers can use the case in a variety of ways:
* For example, homeowners and contractors with a Flir One can easily identify heat or cooling leaks in buildings, find studs in walls, or locate water damage.
* An outdoor enthusiast can observe wildlife, day or night, navigate in the dark, determine if the day’s catch is fully cooked, or make sure a campfire is out by using Flir One.
* A family can detect intruders in total darkness, find a lost pet, or see through smoke in an emergency using a Flir One.
* I bet folks will find their own creative uses for the case.
* A nighttime hide-and-seek, anyone?
* Or, how about a thermal scavenger hunt?
* The case will be available globally in Spring 2014 “for less than $350” and will come in grey, white or gold, with Flir One for select Andriod models coming later in 2014.
* A software development kit to develop Flir One apps will launch later this quarter.
* To reserve yours, register your interest at the Flir website.
