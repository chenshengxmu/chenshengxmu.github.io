* If you think back to just before the iPad 2 was officially announced, you’ll probably also remember the unusual way in which the new hardware was being leaked left and right; specifically, leaks that came out of Chinese supply sites.
* Recently, the Chinese police became involved and as a result, three people have been arrested in relation to the leaking of iPad 2 information after a three month investigation, according to The Wall Street Journal….
* “The court announced the decision Tuesday in statements on its official account at Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service in China. It said that Xiao Chengsong, general manager of Shenzhen MacTop Electronics Co., had offered 20,000 yuan, or about $3,000, plus discounts on MacTop products to a former Hon Hai employee named Hou Pengna, for information about the iPad 2. The court said Ms. Hou then paid Lin Kecheng, a Hon Hai research-and-development employee, to get digital images of the device’s back cover from last September, six months before the iPad 2 was publicly announced.”
* The three culprits now find themselves in prison for between 12-18 months, with fines ranging from $4,500 and $23,000.
* Cases made for the yet unreleased iPad 2 began appearing on various websites a whole four months before the hardware’s big reveal, with leaks believed to be coming from Foxconn employees.
* Foxconn is currently one of the largest suppliers of parts for Apple hardware on the planet, and a likely source for any leaks coming out of China.
