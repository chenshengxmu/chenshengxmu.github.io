* The fourth-generation Apple TV set-top box and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablet with Apple Pencil are due to hit retail tories in the first week of November after launching online toward the end of this month, according to reliable sources who spoke to 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman.
* “The revamped Apple TV set top box and iPad Pro will both begin showing up in Apple Retail Stores for sale during the first week of November after going on sale via Apple’s website in late October,” wrote the publication.
* Author Mark Gurman speculated that the first online orders of both products are likely to reach customers in early November.
* Apple has originally said that the iPad Pro and the new Apple TV will go on sale in November, without providing a specific timeframe.
* The new Apple TV will allow fans to download third-party apps and use their voice to search movies and television shows across iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime and HBO.
* In addition, Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed in an interview with BuzzFeed News’s John Paczkowski that the fourth-generation Apple TV will allow apps beyond these launch partners to expose and make their content discoverable and searchable via iOS 9’s universal search feature.

* Last but not least, the Cupertino firm could release next-generation mouse, trackpad and keyboard accessories, if references to “Magic Keyboard,” “Magic Mouse 2,” and “Magic Trackpad 2” discovered in OS X 10.11.1 beta 3 code are an indication.
* An FCC filing two months ago first hinted at the refresh.
* The new accessories should use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and include Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy connectivity. The Magic Keyboard is expected to feature backlit keys like Mac notebook, according to The New York Times newspaper.
