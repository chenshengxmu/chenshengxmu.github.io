* There’s a new iPhone IM client on the block. Verbs, by #include tech software, is a simple and beautiful IM app that looks like it was designed by Apple itself.
* There are a ton of IM apps on the App Store (IM+, BeejiveIM, fring, AIM and Yahoo! Messenger to name a few).  I’ve used many, and honestly, most of them look pretty awful. I was so excited when I saw the Verbs design mockups several months ago, and the app recently received an update in the App Store that makes it definitely worth reviewing.
* While I’m not someone who constantly relies on instant messaging to communicate, I do see the benefit of having a solid IM app on the iPhone for occasionally hopping on Google Talk. The good thing is that Verbs has more to offer than just good looks…

* While the interface design of Verbs is stunning, it also packs some interesting surprises under the hood.
* Verbs supports Google Talk, AIM and MobileMe chat. Once you log into your account(s), you have a clean and simple layout for viewing and communicating with your friends. The AIM chat integration is really nice. You can edit an avatar, set your status message, and add buddies within the app.
* If you have lots of friends in your IM account, you can create “favorites” lists within Verbs to cut down on who you’re viewing at once.

* Chatting with Verbs feels great. Everything is fluid and intuitive. The swipe feature from the popular Twitter (formerly Tweetie) app is also present.
* Verbs handles multiple chats through the card-like interface that browsers normally use on the iPhone. You can switch between and close open chats just like tabs in mobile Safari. Verbs also makes it easy to send and receive media and files in your mobile chat session. You can send and receive photos and video straight from the iPhone’s camera roll as well.

* Verbs goes the extra mile with its CloudApp and Droplr integration. If you use either file sharing service (I highly recommend CloudApp), Verbs makes sharing files in IM sessions a breeze.

* The app also supports push notifications for uploads and new chat messages. As long as Verbs is open in your iOS app switcher, you’ll remain online and get a notification whenever someone pings you.
* Verbs is a great IM companion for the iPhone. It’s definitely my favorite. I haven’t seen another IM app that’s put together in such a nice package.
* Verbs is available for $2.99 in the App Store. The develepors have said that they will be faithfully updating the app with more features and enhancements, so stay tuned for more from this great client!
* What’s your favorite IM app on the iPhone? Do you like Verbs?
