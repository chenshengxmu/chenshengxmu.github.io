* Earlier today we shared the excellent news with you that the first beta version of iOS 5 had already been jailbroken by MuscleNerd. This tethered jailbreak uses the same LimeRa1n exploit that has been used from iOS 4 to 4.3.3.
* However, because it is a tethered jailbreak, the community was hoping that i0n1c’s untether might still work with iOS 5, but unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it…
* In a tweet sent a few hours ago, i0n1c said:
* R.I.P. – I just heard Apple killed the ndrv_setspec() integeroverflow and his friends in iOS 5.0b1 – if this is true the untether is dead
* If that’s the case, iOS 5 might still be jailbreakable but unless someone comes up with a new untether, this jailbreak will be tethered. Because the LimeRa1n exploit is a bootrom exploit, it can’t be patched with a software update, but an iPhone 5 or iPod Touch 5G would probably fix that with hardware.
* Fingers crossed.
