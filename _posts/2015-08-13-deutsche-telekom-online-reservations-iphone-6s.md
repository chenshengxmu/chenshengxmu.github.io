* German wireless carrier and one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, Deutsche Telekom, has opened an online reservations system for customers looking to buy unreleased next-generation iPhones, likely to be marketed under the ‘iPhone 6s’ and ‘iPhone 6s Plus’ monikers.
* German blog Apfelpage.de, which first reported on the news Thursday morning, said customers can register their interest with the carrier promising to expedite delivery as soon as the new iPhones become available, on a first come first served basis.
* For the time being, the webpage only accepts submissions from Deutsche Telekom’s existing customers who would buy a next-generation iPhone by extending their existing contract.
* Submissions are limited to one per customer. The online form is available at reservierungsservice.telekom.de.
* A FAQ offers more details for those interested in purchasing an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus with the carrier, though Deutsche Telekom does not refer to upcoming devices by their name because they have yet to be formally unveiled by Apple.
* The California firm is rumored to hold a media event on Wednesday, September 9.
* The event is thought to serve as a launchpad for new iPhones, iPads and a next-generation Apple TV hardware with Siri voice control, faster hardware, slimmer design, an App Store with downloadable apps and games and a brand new touchpad remote.
* Deutsche Telekom is one of the largest telecommunications operators in Europe. The company owns T-Mobile which operates in a number of European territories, and is a parent company of T-Mobile USA.
