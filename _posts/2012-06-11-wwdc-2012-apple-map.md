* Apple just unveiled the new Maps at WWDC in San Francisco, nuking Google Maps out of the orbit. It’s got everything a mapping app should have, including turn-by-turn GPS, voice commands and spoken directions, detailed traffic layers and of course that rumored three-dimensional view bound to knock your socks off…
* Apple’s new Maps app finally supports turn-by-turn navigation. It’s got Yelp integrate in it and features over a hundred million business listings right off the bat.
* Designed by Apple from the ground up, Maps gives you turn-by-turn spoken directions, interactive 3D views, and the stunning Flyover feature.1 All of which may just make this app the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.
* Here’s turn-by-turn in action.

* But Apple isn’t stopping there. The new Maps features useful incident reports.
* We’re also building a traffic service.
* This is what traffic incidents look like.

* What Apple meant by “building a traffic service” is that they’re collecting anonymous, real-time, crowd-source data on the traffic conditions.
* Coupled with turn-by-turn navigation, you can now be alerted if a faster route is available due to traffic conditions and these alerts can appear even on the lock screen.

* And of course, the new Maps app enables voice features through Siri integration.
* You can ask questions like where can I get gas.
* Uh-oh, goodbye Google Maps.
* As for the new 3D view, it’s called Flyover.

* Forstall noted it’s an eye-candy.
* Now a really fun feature that we’re adding to our app is something called flyover.
* And here it is in action on the iPhone.

* This is all being rendered in real-time, mind you.
* We’ve been building up 3D models of cities around the world.
* If I were Google, I’d be very concerned.
* And this is what the breathtaking Flyover mode in the new Maps looks like on the iPad.

* You can rotate to see sides of buildings, switch between 2D and 3D modes and access the usual satellite imagery.
* Best of all, it looks like the new Maps app will provide directions and local search for countries outside of the United States, and so would Siri.
* Was it everything you hoped for?
