* If every day is a game, then there should be prizes, right? Foursquare’s Swarm app has started offering just that, real-life perks depending on where and how often you check in. Called Swarm Challenges, this is yet another feature that Foursquare has brought back to Swarm from its main mobile application, which is now focused on places reviews while Swarm is all about the check-in game.
* Swarm users in the United States can participate in challenges throughout the summer for their chance to win such perks as trips, photography gear, concert tickets, stellar seats at a baseball game and more.
* Users needn’t do anything special: when Swarm launches a new challenge, everyone on Swarm will get get a notification in their inbox. Simply follow the challenge instructions and check in to certain types of places to participate.
* Once you’ve completed the challenge, you’ll be automatically entered to win.
* The first challenge, called Summer Kickoff, is available starting today and requires you to check into three summer spots like beaches, pools, bars and so forth. If you do that in the next two weeks, you’ll be entered to win $10,000 towards a dream vacation.
* Swarm is a free download from the App Store.
