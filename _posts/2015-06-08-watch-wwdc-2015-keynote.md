* Folks who missed Apple’s WWDC keynote this morning, or would just like to watch it again, will be happy to hear that Apple has posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. Obviously you can read everything you need to know about today’s event right here on iDB, but if you have the time, the video is worth watching.
* This was an interesting keynote, to say the least. Apple kicked off the event with a lengthy celeb-filled comedy sketch, and kept things light throughout the entire presentation. Drake came up and talked about music, Eddy Cue did a little dance, and there was the usual dose of photoshopped images of Apple’s executive team.
* The keynote doesn’t appear to be available on Apple’s YouTube channel yet, so we can’t embed it here, but for those of you who would like to watch the clip, you can find it on Apple’s website by clicking here. Just make sure that the device you’re using has QuickTime installed, or a similar player that supports QuickTime files.
* So, what’d you think of today’s event?
