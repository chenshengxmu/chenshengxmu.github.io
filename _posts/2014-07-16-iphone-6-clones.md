* If the very thought of waiting until September when Apple is expected to formally announce its next iPhone is making you nervous and edgy because you simply need an iPhone 6 now, your best bet is one of the iPhone 6 knock-offs that are now cropping up all over the place in China.
* Granted, it’s easy to make the argument that Apple should send its legal sharks after China’s well-versed knock-off makers and put a stop to them.
* However, these iPhone 6 lookalikes are already here and not really going anywhere, as is limned in a pair of videos embedded right after the break…
* As first reported by 86DIGI [via NowhereElse.fr, Google translate], an Android KitKat device shown off in a video below, dubbed the Wico i6, is trying to pass itself as a non-existent iPhone 6.
* Curiously, it sports a 4.7-inch screen with a screen resolution of 960-by-1,704 pixels. Eagle-eyed readers could note that it’s exactly the same resolution and pixel count that the iPhone 6 is rumored to have.
* The device apparently features a quad-core chip with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of flash storage.
* Soundtrack?
* The Carpenters’ “Top of the World”.
* The other video depicts additional design aspects of the device.
* Most iPhone clones, but not all, couldn’t be farther from the real thing. For example, the videos clearly show an unsightly camera bulge and the pasted Apple logo.
* For better or worse, iPhone clones have been a fact of life ever since the original iPhone’s inception back in 2007. Some Chinese knock-off makers are notorious for producing iPhone clones in the weeks and months leading up to the original product’s launch.
* Case in point: the infamous clone maker Goophone said its Android-driven Goophone i6, based on alleged iPhone 6 leaks, will go on sale on August 1 – conspicuously ahead of Apple’s expected launch in September.
* Goophone’s iPhone 5s clone costs $160.

* Though the vast majority of iPhone clones are rubbish and plasticky, it’d be inane to deny that some are quite sophisticated.
* The GooPhone, for example, has a 4.7-inch LCD IPS screen, is powered by Mediatek’s quad-core MT6582 chip with GB RAM and sports a 13-megapixel camera on the back.
* Fun fact: Goophone has been successfully producing iPhone clones since the launch of the iPhone 4 in the summer of 2010. Its iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s clones beat Apple with time-to-market while giving the old adage “imitation is the highest form of flattery” a whole new meaning.
* Goophone clones HTC and Samsung devices, too, as evidenced by their website.
* Goophone’s shameless iPhone 5s is an elaborate knock-off.

* Anyway, we’ve posted the videos purely for the sake of entertainment so do meet us in comments and chime in with your thoughts and observations.
* Should Apple drag the likes of Goophone to court, do you think?
