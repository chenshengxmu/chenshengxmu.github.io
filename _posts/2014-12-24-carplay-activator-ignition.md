* CarPlay Activator, a tweak that we reviewed in depth a few weeks ago, is now available for download on Cydia as Ignition. The tweak, which is remarkably free of charge, is from well-respected developer Adam Bell. If you’re not interested in dropping north of $500 on a CarPlay head unit with a terrible resistive touch screen, then Ignition may be the answer to your CarPlay desires.
* In the Cydia description, Bell states that Ignition is primarily meant for the iPad, and that iPhones are not really supported. He does, however, acknowledge that the iPhone 6 Plus is a viable candidate for Ignition. In the video walkthrough above, I’m using Ignition on my iPhone 6 Plus, and I find that it works great.
* The next thing you’ll need to do is find a way to mount your iPad or iPhone in your car. That way, you’ll have an awesome CarPlay interface readily available with the great capacitive touch screen to go along with it.
* Why spend extra and endure the headache of having an after market head unit installed when you can use this? Again, Ignition is available free of charge on the BigBoss repo. Check it out, and let me know what you think in the comment section down below.
