* If you were disappointed to hear that Nike was shuttering its FuelBand hardware, never fear, another major sportswear brand is picking up the baton. Adidas has unveiled its latest fitness tracking device, the miCoach Fit Smart, this week.
* Revealed in San Francisco, during the Wearable Technologies Conference 2014, the device is capable of measuring your steps taken, pace, burned calories, heart rate, and more. It’s also durable, lightweight, and sweatproof (not waterproof)…
* Here’s an excerpt from Adidas’ press release:
* Designed for running, training and fitness, FITSMART is unlike many of the activity trackers on the market today as it measures heart rate response to physical activity and then guides the user train at the right intensity for the best results.
* Marrying clean and simple design lines with an intuitive user experience, FIT SMART is engineered in Germany to become an essential piece of any fitness enthusiast’s training gear. Weighing in at 58 grams, FIT SMART offers unparalleled comfort and fit with a soft touch silicon strap.
* The Fit Smart weighs 58 grams (2 ounces) and comes in two colors: black or a translucent, milky white. An LED light array provides at-a-glance information about a user’s workout, and vibration feedback lets them know when a goal is met.
* As you’ve probably figured out by now, this isn’t your run-of-the-mill smartwatch. It does sync up with iPhone and Android apps, but it’s only meant to be worn during workouts—not all day.. This would explain it’s short, 10-hour battery life.
* The wearable market is getting crowded, but there’s certainly still room for Adidas and all of its experience. It’ll be interesting to see how consumers respond to the Fit Smart, when it becomes available for sale on August 15, priced around $200.
* What do you think of the Fit Smart?
