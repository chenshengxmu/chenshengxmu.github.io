* Yesterday the highly anticipated Springtomize 2 was officially released. To celebrate, we’ve partnered with developer Filippo Bigarella to give back to the jailbreak community.
* We’ve got 5 free copies to give away to five fortunate readers. Folks, this is one of, if not the most in-depth jailbreak app available on Cydia, and it can be yours for free. Check inside for the details on how to win…
* Step 1: Tell us how you plan to use Springtomize 2 in a comment below. Be sure to include a method to contact you. Twitter is preferred, but not required.
* On Monday we will find our favorite comments and select five winners. You will need to provide us with your Cydia Account Number in order to participate, so you must have a jailbroken iDevice.
* If you’ve yet to watch our in-depth walkthrough of Springtomize 2, you can watch it below:
