* In an effort to let everyone get a taste of its many features and premium content, lossless music service Tidal will be introducing a free 12-day trial beginning on Christmas Day.
* As The Verge reported Friday, signing up for the 12-day trial will be possible with an email address alone, without requiring that users enter their credit card information.
* There are no strings attached—the free trial will give music lovers unrestricted access to Tidal’s catalog of songs, albums and more than 130,000 music videos in high definition. The premium $19.99/month tier that enables CD-quality lossless streaming will be included in the free trial.

* The trial period will last until January 5.
* “The streaming service says it will release exclusive content on each day of the trial, including four new original content series’, interviews, music videos and documentaries on Rapsody and Trombone Shorty as well as giving away some concert tickets,” said The Verge.
* Tidal has a nice iOS app that takes full advantage of the native iPhone X display resolution. As of recently, Tidal supports CarPlay and just yesterday launched its brand new Apple TV app.
* Tidal is priced at $9.99 per month for standard sound quality, or $19.99 per month for lossless streaming. Other tiers are available, too, like family and student accounts.
* Will you be singing up for Tidal’s 12-day trial on Christmas Day?
