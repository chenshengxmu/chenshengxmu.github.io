* A few days ago we talked about GeoHot and the amazing fact that he seemed to have a jailbreak for iPhone 4. It turns out the picture he gave us was actually a fake. Bummer!
* In an update to his last blog post, the wonder kid destroyed the few credibility he had left. He says:
* Sorry, this post was probably a bad idea. Next time I wonâ€™t say anything. I miss when this blog was actually about technical things(Iâ€™ve been reacting too much to the feedback, which led it to the place itâ€™s in now). I didnâ€™t fully realize most of the current scene donâ€™t care unless they are getting something. Now I do. Itâ€™s late tonight, Iâ€™ll think about what to do about this in the morning.
* The real reason behind no release isnâ€™t technical. Itâ€™s just that it will never stop, after blackra1n, people demand unlock, after blacksn0w, people demand untethered. I miss the days when jailbreaking and unlocking were difficult, it attracted a much higher caliber crowd.
* Also, to the haters, the picture is quite obviously fake ðŸ˜€
* I have a lot of respect for GeoHotâ€™s work. The guy is clearly a genius (let me remind you he was the first to unlock the first iPhone back in 2007), but like everyone notices, heâ€™s just too cocky and egocentric, which is probably why some call him EgoHot.
* So what now for jailbreakers and unlockers? The good news is that the Spirit jailbreak for iPhone 4 will be released soon. In the meantime, the Dev Team is working on an unlock as well.
* The world is not going to stop but itâ€™s just too bad GeoHot wonâ€™t invest himself in what heâ€™s obviously good at. Oh well, after all heâ€™s free to do whatever he wants.
* What do you think?
