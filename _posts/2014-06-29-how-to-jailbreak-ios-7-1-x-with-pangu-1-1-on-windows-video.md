* The highly anticipated Pangu 1.1 update was just today released for both Windows and Mac users. Obviously, the big news here was Mac compatibility, as Mac users were left without a usable version after the initial Windows-only version of Pangu 1.1 was released.
* But Windows users should be happy too, as version 1.1 of Pangu brings with it English text that makes it easier to follow along in the jailbreak process. The update also gets rid of the nefarious checkbox that allowed pirated software to be easily installed on your device.
* Pangu 1.1 is a streamlined version of the original tool. If you’ve been on the fence about using it, then perhaps this latest update will ease your concerns. Check inside to view our step-by-step jailbreak tutorial for Pangu 1.1 on Windows.
* Step 1: Download Pangu 1.1 for Windows from our downloads page
* Step 2: Plug your iOS 7.1.x device in to your computer’s USB port
* Step 3: Open Pangu_v1.1.exe on your Windows machine. You may see a blue error box. If so, click more info and click Run Anyway (see video tutorial for more information). The Pangu app should open.
* Step 4: Once your device is detected by the app, click the Start Jailbreak button
* Step 5: Pangu will ask you to go to Settings > General > Date & Time and disable the Set Automatically toggle. You will then need to set the date to June 2, 2014
* Step 6: Once the date is set, the jailbreak process will begin automatically. After a little while, Pangu will ask you to open the Pangu app icon on the Home screen of your iOS device. Tap the Pangu icon to launch the Pangu app and tap the Continue button
* Step 7: The jailbreak will continue process. You will be asked to unlock your device after it reboots
* Step 8: Once the jailbreak is completed, you should see Cydia on your Home screen
* You now have an untethered jailbreak on iOS 7.1.x using Pangu v 1.1 on your Windows machine.
