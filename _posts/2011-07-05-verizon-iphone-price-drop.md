* Apple didn’t surprise too many people when they didn’t announce a new version of their popular smartphone last month. We’ve known since March that Apple wasn’t planning on unveiling any new hardware at their WWDC conference.
* A majority of the rumor mill points to an early fall release for the next iPhone, and we have a few reasons to believe that’s accurate. It’s been reported that Apple has already dropped supply orders in anticipation for the new model, now we’re getting word of an iPhone 4 price-drop…
* A sign of a product refresh usually means a price drop of the current version. Take cars for example. A 2011 model’s price would drop once a 2012 model becomes available, because why would anyone pay the same amount of money for an older car?
* VZBuzz, also known as the Unofficial Verizon Blog, reported yesterday that the iPhone 4 might see a $50 price drop in the near future. The site posted the above picture as well, which seems to be a screenshot of Verizon’s website offering the iPhone 4 16GB model for $150.99.
* The ad also depicts several Android devices on sale, but that’s about as common as a belly button. Apple on the other hand, rarely allows carriers to discount its products unless they’re refurbished or out of date (see 3GS).
* Whether the discounted price has to do with the impending next-gen launch or not remains to be seen. But if you’re on Big Red’s network and have been thinking about getting the iPhone 4, it might be worth waiting a month or two.
* Anyone looking to snag an iPhone 4 at this price?
