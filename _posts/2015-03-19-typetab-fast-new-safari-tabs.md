* When you open a new tab in Safari, the default behavior is to showcase your favorites. You can then tap a favorite, or you can tap the address bar to manually insert a web address. TypeTab makes it so that the cursor is automatically inserted into the address bar and that the keyboard is exposed. Therefore, it’s quicker to begin typing a web address when opening a new tab.
* After installing TypeTab, there are no settings or options that need to be configured. Once it is installed, open Safari and open a new tab. You should notice that the keyboard opens automatically and the cursor appears directly in the address bar ready to type.

* For what it’s worth, the developer of TypeTab, Andrew Hyatt, states that his tweak works on both the iPad and iPhone versions of Safari. For those of you using physical Bluetooth keyboards with your iOS device, the keyboard shortcut for opening a new tab plays nice with TypeTab as well.
* TypeTab isn’t the type of tweak that will razzle-dazzle you, but it will speed up your workflow in minute increments. What do you think about TypeTab? You can find it free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Sound off with your thoughts below.
