* Following Tuesday’s iPhone X event, Apple has quietly raised prices across Wi-Fi and cellular iPad Pro models with 256GB and 512GB of storage by $50 for seemingly no apparent reason.
* Apple didn’t provide an explanation, but it’s widely speculated that an undersupply of NAND flash memory chips, coupled with a surge in orders for the new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models, has resulted in a pretty dramatic increase in the cost of NAND flash storage.
* Here are the affected iPad Pro models following the price hike:
* Pricing for the baseline iPad Pro models with 64 gigabytes of storage remain the same as when they launched in June: the 10.5-inch 64GB iPad Pro still starts at $649 and its 12.9-inch counterpart at $799. Before the price hike, 10.5-inch iPad Pro pricing was $799/$899/$1099 for the 64/256/512GB Wi-Fi models and 10.5-inch iPad Pro pricing was $649/$749/$949.
* Other than pricing, nothing has changed in terms of hardware, software or design.
* The price hike is seen in other regions, including Europe and Australia. In certain oversea markets, customers are now required to pay even higher prices that the equivalent of $50.
* In the United Kingdom Apple Store, for example, the price of the Wi-Fi-only 10.5-inch iPad Pro model with 256 gigabytes of storage has gone from £709 to £769.
* It’s unclear if the prices will drop to their original levels once NAND flash supply improves. I purchased my 10.5-inch iPad Pro just a few weeks ago, thankfully. If you’re in the market for a new iPad Pro, some retailers are still offering the original pricing.
