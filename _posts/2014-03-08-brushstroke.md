title: Brushstroke turns your pictures into paintings you can mount on your wall
---
* Most of the time, filter apps give you some interesting tints, atmospheric frames, or tilt-shifting blur effects. There are even a few that will turn you into a cartoon or pencil sketch. Sometimes, though a photo effects app will really do something special to your image.

* Brushstroke is one of those effects apps that completely remakes your pictures into a faux painting. Even more interesting, you can buy a mounted canvas print of your image and hang it on your wall…
* Users can transform normal pictures into thick brushstroke paintings that look like they’ve been painted with oil on thick canvas, or with acrylic on wood. Then, they can add their signature and order a physical mounted print for as low as $55.
* Start by adding a photo. You can either select one from your photo library, or take a picture directly from inside the app. The first thing that will happen is that the image will be “painted.” It is really just the app loading the filter. It only takes about two seconds, tops.

* Then, select from 38 different filters, each with a different style of brushstroke. There are seven different brushstroke categories, including “Washed,” “Abstract,” “Frayed,” and more. When you find the brushstroke that works right with the image, move onto the color options.
* There are 35 different color options, including “Tones,” “Shades,” “Saturations,” and more. Different colors will add or remove different shadows and effects of the original image. The next step is to choose a canvas.
* In addition to the five traditional canvas options, you can select from six different paper varieties, and burlap or wood. Each canvas option will add a slight differentiation in the texture.
* You can also manually adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, density, exposure, shadows, highlights, and temperature of the image.

* Once you’ve perfected your faux painting, add your personal signature. Tap the “a” tab and hand-write your autograph. It will automatically shrink down into the lower right corner of the image.
* When you are done you can save the image to your photo library and share it on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. You can also send it directly to someone through email or text message. If you want a physical print of your faux painting, tap the “ship” button to order it directly from CanvasPop.  You can choose the frame style and size. Mounted prints can be as small as 10” x 10,” or as large as 28” x 21.”
* Brushstroke is available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for $2.99. Download it in the App Store today.
