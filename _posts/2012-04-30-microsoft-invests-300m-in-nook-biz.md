* Microsoft just announced this morning plans to invest in Barnes & Noble’s Nook division, in an effort to better compete with the likes of Apple and Amazon in an increasingly competitive market for electronic books.
* The Windows maker will form a yet-to-be-named subsidiary with Barnes & Noble, pouring a cool $300 million of its own money into the new entity. It will encompass all of the Nook biz, it has been confirmed, in addition to educational college content.
* With this investment Microsoft is thinking big, securing a 17.6 percent stake in the new company valued at a whopping $1.7 billion…
* According to a press release, the partnership will also see the release of a Nook app for the upcoming Windows 8 operating system:
* One of the first benefits for customers will be a NOOK application for Windows 8, which will extend the reach of Barnes & Noble’s digital bookstore by providing one of the world’s largest digital catalogues of e-Books, magazines and newspapers to hundreds of millions of Windows customers in the U.S. and internationally.
* Taking a page from Apple’s book, Microsoft clearly is aiming to secure premium e-book content for Windows 8 tablets, correctly recognizing that the tablet market is about ecosystems, not hardware.
* It will be also interesting seeing how this strategic partnership affects the Nook e-reader, which is built on a forked version of Google’s Android platform. It’s too early to tell, but the news could indicate plans to switch future Nooks away from Android and build them around Microsoft’s Windows 8 platform instead.
* Apple, of course, is facing an antitrust lawsuit as the Department of Justice (DoJ) alleges the company convoluted with five major publishers to fix prices in the e-book industry. Though three publishers settled with the government, Apple decided to fight DoJ’s accusations in court.
* Experts think DoJ will lose the case, arguing there’s nothing wrong with the so-called agency model Apple employs for content sales on the iTunes store, which includes electronic books sold on the iBookstore. Apple lets publishers pick their own prices for e-books, taking its standard 30 percent cut on proceeds.
* Contrast this to Amazon’s wholesale model that lets the online retailer set the prices, with publishers having little or no say over how their titles are being priced and promoted.
* However, others point out that Apple is also requiring that publishers do not undercut their iBookstore releases on competing stores, which in itself might validate the government’s antitrust claims.
* What do you think, is Microsoft’s partnership with Barnes & Noble going to change the dynamics of the e-book market?
* For better or worse?
