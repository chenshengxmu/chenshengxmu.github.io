* As promised, software maker Microsoft has just issued an update to Skype for the iPhone and iPod touch adding native display support for the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, the team announced in a blog post Wednesday morning.
* As a result, you’ll see more of your recent chats and messages in conversation view on Apple’s new smartphones because iOS 8 doesn’t have to compensate for the lack of iPhone 6 support by blowing up the interface to fill up the whole screen.
* Skype for iPhone 5.6, available free in the App Store, also adds presence indicators to your Recent list and number of contacts and time zones information on contact profiles.
* Jump past the fold for other features in this maintenance Skype update.
* Skype 5.6 changelog:
* This is Skype’s second iOS 8-focused update following the previous update that enabled support for iOS 8’s Interactive Notifications for incoming calls and messages on the Lock screen, banner alerts and within the Notification Center.
* On the desktop front, yesterday landed a brand new Skype 7.0 for Mac with an overhauled chat experience and other goodies.
* The 65-megabyte download is available free in the App Store. Skype’s iPad edition did not receive a matching refresh today.
