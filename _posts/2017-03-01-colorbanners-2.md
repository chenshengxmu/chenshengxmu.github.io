* When iOS 10 launched, there was quite a bit of gasping at the appearance of the new notification banner style throughout the operating system, including those that appear in apps, on the Lock screen, and in Notification Center.
* Fortunately, a jailbreak tweak called ColorBanners 2 by David Goldman can help you to make your notifications a little easier to look at, as it lets you to colorize them in nearly any way you’d like.
* By default, the tweak is designed to colorize your notification banners based on the dominant color(s) of the app icon of the app that’s giving you the notification:

* On the other hand, if you don’t want to set it up that way, you don’t have to. The tweak adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can configure your banner notifications to be any color you wish:

* In each pane, you can enable or disable the tweak’s effects separately for each interface. You can also:
* Personally, I’m a fan of the way the developer gives you the choice of colorizing your banners manually or via the dominant app icon color. I typically prefer the latter because it’s automatic and requires virtually no customization, but if you’re running a specific kind of theme that’s centered around a certain color, the ability to manually override with a color choice of your own is a good way to stay within uniformity. I’m all for customization, and for that reason, I give this tweak a thumbs up.
* If you’re interested in trying ColorBanners 2, it’s available in Cydia’s BigBoss repository today for $0.99. ColorBanners 2 is compatible only with jailbroken iOS 10 devices, but the original ColorBanners tweak can be installed on iOS 8-9 devices if you happen to have one of those instead.
