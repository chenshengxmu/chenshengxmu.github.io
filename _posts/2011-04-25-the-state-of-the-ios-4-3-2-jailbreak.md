* There are now several ways to jailbreak your iPhone running iOS 4.3.2. RedSn0w, PwnageTool, and Sn0wBreeze will all jailbreak the iPhone on 4.3.2.
* 4.3.2 hasn’t been out for that long, but i0n1c’s untethered exploit has already been implemented into three of the most popular jailbreak tools.
* We have the Dev Team, i0n1c, and iH8Sn0w to thank for pushing out untethered jailbreaks for iOS 4.3.2 so quickly.
* RedSn0w will jailbreak your iPhone on both Windows and Mac OS X. PwnageTool is a Mac-only program. Sn0wBreeze is for Windows users only.
* As always, grab your firmwares and jailbreak tools from our iPhone downloads section.
* Have you jailbroken iOS 4.3.2? Let us know how it went in the comments!
