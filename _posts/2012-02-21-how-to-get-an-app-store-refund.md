* The App Store has over 500,000 applications available for download. That means that your iOS device has access to some of the best mobile software money can buy — and, unfortunately, some of the crappiest.
* Here at iDB, we’ve seen a number of examples of bad software. And no, we’re not talking about the 300+ fart apps out there. We’re talking about apps that you download expecting one thing, and then get another.
* Luckily, there is a way to get your money back on these applications…
* We touched on this process a few years back, but given all of the recent talk about counterfeit apps surfacing in the App Store, we figured it was time to cover it again.
* Step 1. From your web browser, go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com. Login using your Apple ID and password.
* Step 2. Search for the item for which you want to request a refund, then click on “Report a Problem.”

* Step 3. You should now be presented with a list of reasons why you’d want to be refunded. Select the most appropriate reason and give more details, if necessary. Click the Submit button when done.

* That’s all there is to it! Don’t expect a refund or response right away, although Apple is usually pretty quick at taking care of these requests.. Keep in mind that the standard policy for iTunes purchases is ‘All Sales Final.’
* It’s also worth noting that if Apple does refund your money, they expect the developer to refund them. And they still keep their 30% take. So make sure the app is really worth a refund, because the developer loses $0.30 on the dollar.

* Of course, we could avoid all of this nonsense if Apple would just incorporate a trial period for app purchases. Even something short — say 15 minutes — would be enough time to determine if the app worked as advertised.
