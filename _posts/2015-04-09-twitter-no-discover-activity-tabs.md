* Twitter giveth, Twitter taketh away. Twitter first said this morning that iPhone users can now upload and share their gorgeous 120FPS and 240FPS slow-motion videos through its mobile app and now we’re receiving word that the startup will soon axe the Discover and Activity tabs from Twitter for iPhone and iPad.
* The change, apparently a result of lack of interest, will be rolling out to mobile users over the next few days.
* Both the Discover and Activity tabs will be removed as Twitter seeks out new ways to encourage content discovery and trending hashtags on the network.
* As shown above, the new way of displaying hashtags and exploring what’s trending revolves around a redesigned Search interface. There, brief snippets of information regarding trending topics will be offered, such as a description below each trend, how many tweets have been sent, whether viral content is trending upwards or downwards in popularity and more.
* Both Twitter for iOS and Android will be affected by this change. The new trends with descriptions experience is rolling out now in the U.S. in English for users who have tailored trends on iOS and Android.
* “We’re currently experimenting with similar features on web and look forward to expanding this experience to more countries in the future,” noted the startup. No app update will be required as Twitter will remove both tabs via a silent refresh of its backend.
* In addition to announcing support the iPhone’s slow-motion video this morning, Twitter earlier this week rolled out a redesigned ‘Quote Tweet’ feature with comments and earlier refreshed TweetDeck for Mac with group direct messaging feature, inline video, support for animated GIFs and more.
* Twitter is available at no cost in the App Store and Mac App Store.
