* A brand new SKU (Stock-Keeping Unit) in the full-size iPad lineup that one blog obtained from retail sources suggested that Apple’s readying to add a new top-of-the-line fourth-generation iPad model with 128 gigabytes of storage. The development corroborates an earlier finding of code hooks in iTunes 11 and iOS 6.1 that points to the new 128GB full-size iPad model. And now, the same publication that leaked the 128GB SKU claims to have pinpointed the prices for this “Ultimate” iPad model…
* 9to5Mac has amended its post with purported pricing information, as follows:
* The pricing is in line with a higher storage capacity, coming in at around $799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for the Cellular-compatible model in the United States.
* Here are your SKUs the site obtained from a “high-profile U.S. retailer”.

* P101 and P103 denote WiFi and Cellular units. Storage sizes are 16GB (“GOOD”), 32GB (“BETTER”), 64GB (“BEST”) and 128GB (“ULTIMATE”). Additionally, “A” stands for the black model and “B” is the white option.
* The “Ultimate” designation probably indicates just a storage bump rather than any additional features as this new 128GB iPad 4 is expected to look just the same as the 16/32/64GB models.
* The author of the post speculates that Apple might target the 128GB iPad for specific agencies, like universities and government, though that remains to be seen.
