* Following news yesterday that the iPad Air will be heading to regional US providers like Bluegrass Cellular and C Spire Wireless, US Cellular announced that it too would be landing the new tablet.
* The carrier, which is the fifth-largest in the United States, says it plans to launch the Air alongside the iPhone 5s and 5c in November. So subscribers may want to start getting their wallets out now…
* This will be the first time that US Cellular has offered Apple products to its customers. The company was a long-time holdout due to “unacceptable terms,” but it announced in May that it had folded.
* While the other regional carriers were very vague about their launch dates, saying only “in the coming weeks,” US Cellular says it will start offering the Air on November 8— a week after it goes on sale.
* Apple unveiled the redesigned iPad Air earlier this week, alongside a new iPad mini with Retina display. For more information on the two tablets, click here, and for pricing and availability details, click here.
