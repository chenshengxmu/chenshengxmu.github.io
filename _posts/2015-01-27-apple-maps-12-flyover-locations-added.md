* Apple Maps has an impressive feature called Flyover that taps high-resolution aerial photography turned into three-dimensional terrain, landmarks and buildings that can be rotated around in the full 360-degree freedom.
* It’s pretty awesome and also quite expensive to create. Apple basically has to fly a fleet of special aircraft to do terrain mapping in the sky. That’s why, as of this writing, Flyover was available in a little more than a hundred locations around the world.
* As spotted by Dutch website iCulture.nl, a dozen new cities and landmarks across Europe (and some in the U.S.) have received their Flyover treatment in Apple Maps.
* If some of you fellows live in Texas, Puerto Rico, Italy, Germany, France, England, Sweden, Denmark or Czech Republic, feel free to Flyover in the following newly added locations:
* To enjoy Flyover, fire up Apple Maps on your Mac, iPhone or iPad.
* Next, tap the search bar and type in the name of any Flyover-enabled location. Now, hit the little “i” icon in the lower right and choose “Show 3D Map,” and also switch from Standard to Hybrid or Satellite.
* Zoom in far enough until buildings appear in 3D and then drag with two fingers to tilt and rotate the view.
* More on supported Flyover locations can be found on Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage.
