* The folks over at Taptaptap, the creators of Camera+, have posted an interesting set of photo comparisons, showing how the iPhone’s camera has evolved over the years. Included in the set are photos taken using Camera+ on the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, 5s and the new iPhone 6, in various situations.
* One of the more interesting comparisons, for me at least, is in the macro shot. Note that the 2G and 3G iPhones can’t even focus on the strawberry stem, but you start to see major improvements with the iPhone 4 and 4S. The images get better with the 5 and 5s, and details in the iPhone 6 photo look even sharper.

* Another noteworthy comparison is in low light capabilities, which is an area the iPhone 6 really shines in. As noted by Taptaptap’s Lisa Bettany, you can clearly see the decrease in the noise of the iPhone 6 photo vs those from its predecessors—a change that can be attributed to Apple’s newly-altered low light algorithm.

* I encourage you to read Bettany’s full post over at Snapsnapsnap, as it features several other photo comparisons that are interactive—clicking a picture brings up the full-size photo. It offers a great look at how the iPhone’s camera has evolved over the last 7 years, and 8 generations, and how the iPhone 6 stacks up.
* Earlier this month, Taptaptap teased Camera+ 6, which is expected to launch soon. And for more information on the iPhone 6’s camera, click here.
