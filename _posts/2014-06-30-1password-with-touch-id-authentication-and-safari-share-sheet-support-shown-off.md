* A big part of what makes iOS 8 so great is how Apple is finally opening up its mobile operating system to developers, more than ever before.
* Take Touch ID, for example. With a little help from the iOS 8 SDK and the new Local Authentication Framework, third-party apps can tap Touch ID to authenticate a user in a safe manner as fingerprint data is protected and never accessed by iOS or apps.
* Brands such as PayPal have pledged to update their apps with Touch ID authentication when iOS 8 gets released for public consumption this Fall and now a beta tester has posted screenshots and a short video of Touch ID integration in 1Password for iOS, the popular password management program by AgileBits…
* As evidenced by the screenshot top of post, published by French site iGen.fr [Google translate], the upcoming 1Password 4.6 for iOS will bring out support for Touch ID authentication on the iPhone 5s. If you don’t own the handset, you can continue using a custom passcode like before.
* After enabling Touch ID authentication within 1Password’ settings, firing up the app puts the standard Touch ID authentication prompt instead of 1Password’s custom password entry dialog box.
* The very first beta of 1Password for iOS 8 also brings a brand new Safari extension that installs itself in the Safari Share sheet allowing you to use 1Password’s secure password generator to fill web passwords in Safari.
* This is another big change in iOS 8 as apps can now offer their services system-wide by installing custom actions and extensions into the Share sheet.
* In the case of 1Password’s Safari extension, the video above shows a user choosing 1Password from the Share sheet to use 1Password services to retrieve their username and password on Amazon.
