* Apple demoed a completely new Siri experience for iOS 11 at the WWDC 2017 keynote.
* Not only is Did more fluent in the English language than ever before, but now the virtual assistant has been given two revamped female and male voices that speak in much more natural tones, rather than sounding robotic.
* In addition to a new sound, the Siri interface has been revamped to look more aesthetically pleasing and modern.
* Among the new features Siri has to offer is language translation, which will be capable of translating English to other languages and vice-versa, including Chinese, French, and Spanish among others. That said, you can now translate languages with your iPhone without having to download third-party apps from the App Store.
* Siri will also work with seamlessly iCloud. This will allow everything Siri learns about you from your calendar, Frequent Locations, News usage, events, and more to stay synced across all of your devices for improved queries and Siri suggestions.
* The updated Siri interface and all of its new features will come standard in iOS 11, a preview of which is available to developers starting today.
