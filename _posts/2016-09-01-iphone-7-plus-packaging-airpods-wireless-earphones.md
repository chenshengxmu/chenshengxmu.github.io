* Another day, another iPhone 7 leak. A high-resolution photograph of an alleged iPhone 7 Plus packaging that surfaced this morning would have us believe that a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 model could ship with Apple’s new wireless earbuds in the box.
* The info sticker on the back of supposed packaging shows the details for a 32-gigabyte handset model, suggesting the purchase is bundled with an “AirPods Wireless Earphones”. The purported photo was uploaded anonymously and sent to AppleInsider.
* Here’s the claimed photograph.

* Needless to say, such photos can be faked easily with basic Photoshop knowledge.
* But if legitimate, the images “could indicate that Apple plans to expand its iPhone lineup this year to include different configurations with and without new wireless headphones,” as per Apple Insider.
* AirPods should be true wireless in-ear headphones, meaning separate left and right earpieces with no wire between them. The “AirPods” moniker was recently discovered via a regulatory filing published by the Eurasian Economic Commission.
* Coincidentally or not, Apple PR this morning prematurely leaked that “a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled” at the iPhone 7 event on September 7.
* Although this photo differs from prior leaks that showed iPhone 7 boxes with “EarPods with Lightning Connector” inside, it’s possible that only the flagship 5.5-inch handset could ship with Bluetooth-based AirPods while the 4.7-inch models could come with a Lightning-enabled wired edition of existing EarPods (along with a “Lightning to Headphone Jack Adapter” to help with the transition to a 3.55mm headphone jack-less future).
