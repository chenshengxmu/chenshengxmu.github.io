title: New Jailbreak App Adds 3D Transitions Between Your iPhone Pages
---
* According to its developers, Barrel is a jailbreak tweak that adds a 3D “cube” effect to your icon pages. The description surely fits the bill and doesn’t disappoint, but the price may prove to be a stumbling block.
* Take a look inside as I take a video glimpse at this latest Jailbreak App. Then you can decide for yourself if this visual tweak is worth departing with your hard earned cash…
* The first thing you should know is that this tweak is only for iPhones running iOS 4 and up, and I personally wouldn’t recommend it on anything less than an iPhone 3GS. It would probably make the 3G explode due to the graphical nature of the tweak.
* As far as settings go, you’re not going to find much here, but there is a “mode” setting located in the Settings.app that allows you to switch between inverted 3D cube mode and normal mode. Think of it as being “inside the barrel” and “outside the barrel.”
* That being said, $2.99 is an awfully high price to pay for a tweak with so few settings and options. But, if you’re feeling frivolous, and you’d like to add some additional visual flair to your iPhone’s home screen, it just may be what the doctor ordered.
* Barrel can be downloaded via Cydia, but remember your iPhone must be jailbroken in order to do so. What do you think, is it worth the asking price?
