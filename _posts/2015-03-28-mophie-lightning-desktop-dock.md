* If I had to guess, I’d bet that a lot of iPhone users charge their device at night, next to their bed. Doing so serves two purposes. You can charge your iPhone through the night while you sleep, and you can use it as an alarm clock. When docked, it could also serve as a display for relaxation images and late night talk show viewing.
* The Lightning Desktop Dock from Mophie is a stand that is compatible with the iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, and 6. Connect your device to the dock and it will charge all night while you watch movies in portrait mode until you fall asleep.
* The simplistic dock is made from heavyweight materials so it stays in place when you lift your iPhone 6 from the charging port. The Lightning connector is on a pivot, so you can charge your device whether it is in a case or not. However, the company notes that this particular dock is only compatible with “an Apple Leather or Silicone case made for the iPhone 6.”
* It connects via USB, so you don’t have to connect it to a wall plug. If you are charging your iPhone near your computer, you can connect it right to the USB port.

* Because the dock is designed to display your iPhone 6 in an upright position, you can still use it for a number of activities while it charges. Make FaceTime calls, check your email, and listen to music.
* The cord is 3.5 feet long, which isn’t exactly lengthy. However, it is long enough to reach most household plugs from a tabletop or nightstand.
* It is designed to be compatible with the iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, and iPhone 6, so multiple users can take advantage of its convenient charging power, even if they have an older device (at separate times, of course).
* The Mophie Lightning Desktop Dock costs $79.95 on Amazon and is available in black or gold.
