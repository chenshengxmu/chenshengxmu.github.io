* With recent updates to Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS brought with it iCloud Keychain, which keeps track of your various account usernames and passwords for you so that you only have to remember one password, instead of dozens.
* After you set up your iPhone or iPad for the first time, you were probably prompted to set up iCloud Keychain. Perhaps you chose to wait until later. Perhaps you did activate it on your iPhone, but not on any other compatible device. What next?
* We have a short how-to guide to help you set up iCloud Keychain on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac for the first time, as well as how to connect the password keeper across all devices, including Macs running macOS.
* Step 1: Go to Settings, tap on your profile at the top, then tap on iCloud > Keychain. You will most likely be prompted to enter your Apple ID password.
* Step 2: Toggle the switch On.
* Step 3: You will be required to create an iCloud Security Code. You can use the same code as your iPhone passcode, or create a different one. For this tutorial, we will use the same as iPhone passcode. You will need to remember this code, as well as your Apple ID password.

* Step 4: When prompted, type in a phone number that will be able to receive SMS messages when you need to activate a new device. I used my iPhone since I always have it with me.
* You can add your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch to the iCloud Keychain and all of your account and password information will be synced across all devices. You can also set up iCloud Keychain in OS X.
* Adding a device to iCloud Keychain on iOS:
* Step 1: On the other device you want to use iCloud Keychain with, go to Settings > iCloud > Keychain, and enter your Apple ID password.
* Step 2: Toggle the switch On.
* Step 3: Tap “Restore with Security Code” and enter the password you created when setting up iCloud Keychain for the first time (it may be your iPhone password).

* Step 4: An SMS message will be sent to the phone number that you added for activating a new device. When you receive the text, enter the six-digit verification code.

* Note: In my experience, a message automatically popped up on my iPhone when I activated iCloud Keychain on my iPad. The pop up message asked me to approve the device by entering my Apple ID. I did not need to enter the passcode or wait for the six-digit verification code to be sent to my iPhone.
* Adding a device to iCloud Keychain on Mac:
* Step 1: Go to Apple Menu > System Preference > iCloud.
* Step 2: Select Keychain.
* Step 3: Set a password to unlock your screen after sleep or skip this step.
* Step 4: Enter your Apple ID and password.
* Step 5: Enter the passcode you created when setting up iCloud Keychain.

* Step 6: An SMS message will be sent to the phone number that you added for activating a new device. When you receive the text, enter the six-digit verification code.
* Now that all of your devices are using iCloud Keychain, you can start using it with Safari and it will automatically save usernames, passwords, and credit cards info that you enter in various websites. If you’ve been using Safari’s keychain feature all along, all of the passwords you previously saved will now be available on all devices.

* Now your devices, including your Mac, will all be connected and your various passwords will be saved in iOS and macOS so you can have immediate access to everything, including credit card information, from whereever you are.
* Do you use a password keychain app like 1Password? Will you switch now that Apple offers a similar service for free?
