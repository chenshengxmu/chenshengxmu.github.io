* EA Sports, formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts but now a brand that creates and develops sports video games, on Tuesday released FIFA 15 Ultimate Team as a freemium download in the App Store.
* Coming in at a massive 1.06 gigabytes, this iPhone and iPad game features authentic football action backed by Electronic Arts’ massive marketing budget and whiz-bang campaign, with licensed player and team names, motion-captured animations and other goodies.
* You can build and manage your own team, test your management skills in the Quick Simulation mode, participate in a quick match or test your skills in real-world weekly match ups.
* The control scheme is always of major concern in sports games like FIFA, especially on mobile devices. FIFA 15 Ultimate Team features something called a “through pass” feature allowing you to master your kicks, passes, and shots with classic controls.

* If that’s not your cup of tea, choose “Casual Controls” with fewer buttons. The game supports Game Center for rankings and achievements as well as physical ‘Made for iPhone’ game controllers for better accuracy.
