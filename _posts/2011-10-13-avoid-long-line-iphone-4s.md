* Tomorrow, the iPhone 4S will go on sale in stores around the world, and many people will be (and already are) lining up to purchase one.
* One problem people always encounter when Apple releases a new product is long lines. There are a couple of different ways to avoid the lines, which will save you time, and, most importantly, ensure that you get a new iPhone!
* One common mistake people usually make when buying a new iDevice is going to the Apple Store on launch day. This is a bad idea because tons of other people make the same mistake.
* Though Apple Store’s get more product stock to sell, there are also more people and longer lines, and that decreases your chances of getting actually getting the iPhone 4S. The line length also depends on where you live. If you live in San Francisco, for example, the long might be really long, compared to an Apple Store in the middle of Kansas.
* Apple partners with multiple retail outlets to sell its products. Many people forget that a new Apple product can also be purchased from other retailers besides the Apple Store.
* Best Buy, RadioShack, Walmart, Sam’s Club and Target will all be selling the iPhone 4S, too. Depending on the store size, stock will be much more limited than your local Apple Store, but the benefit is that not many people think of going to Target for a product launch.
* It would be wise to call retail chains in your area that you know sell Apple products. Ask them how long they will be open tomorrow, if they expect to sell out quickly, etc. Some retailers will even let you hold an iPhone behind the desk for a limited time.
* With the iPhone 4S now available on Sprint, you have a better opportunity of getting an iPhone 4S this weekend. There are more carrier stores than Apple Stores, so a carrier store would be a good bet for finding an iPhone and avoiding the lines. Carriers will have smaller stock, but their outlets usually outnumber Apple Stores in a particular area.
* The last alternative to going to a store is ordering online. This guarantees you a device, and a specific color and storage option. You are given the same options as buying from the store when buying online. Buying online also gives saves you time, instead of waiting in a long line.
* In the case of the iPhone 4S, buying online will ensure that you don’t get your device shipped for at least another week. Shipping estimates have fallen to 1-2 weeks worldwide for online orders, so that’s something to consider.
* iPhone 4S pre-orders have already sold out on all three US carriers, and there will be limited stock available for launch tomorrow. In most cases, the people in front of the line get the newest product, while those in the back get no such luck.
* If you’re smart, you may just be able to avoid the lines and snag an iPhone 4S tomorrow. Let us know what you decide to do!
