* As promised by Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen yesterday, he has removed the hugely popular game from the App Store, without giving any really convincing reason as to why.
* Nguyen claims that he was fed up with the unwanted attention he was receiving after the unexpected success of Flappy Bird, a game that had been released months ago, but which only recently started getting traction…
* In a series of tweets published yesterday, Nguyen also explained that he had no intention to sell Flappy Bird and that he will continue making games.
* At this time, it’s still very unclear what the real motivations behind the removal of the game are. While it’s very possible that Nguyen was indeed tired of the attention he was getting, that is something a reported revenue of roughly $50,000 per day should have alleviated, at least for most of us.
* Nguyen also claims that his decision was not motivated by legal reasons, but it’s hard to believe Nintendo was ok with Nguyen’s choice of design elements that are greatly inspired from the company’s iconic Mario games.
* If you have already downloaded Flappy Bird, you will of course still be able to play it. But as it stands, it’s now nowhere to be found in the App Store.
* Dong Nguyen has a few other games available in the App Store, somewhat similar to Flappy Bird. If you’re already missing the game, you can download Super Ball Juggling and Shuriken Block. They’re both available for free. And of course, there are already plenty of Flappy Bird knockoffs, including the now #1 free game Ironpants.
