* I think it’s safe to say that the Auxo jailbreak tweak was a resounding success. As you may remember, it initially started out as a concept posted on The Verge forums. Its designer, Sentry, hooked up with a more than capable developer, and eventually the pair made the concept into a successfully reality.
* Well it appears that Sentry is back, this time with a new concept aimed around improving the functionality of Apple’s built in Do Not Disturb feature. While Apple may not think that it needs improvement, judging from the advertisement spot it just released showcasing the feature, Sentry believes that he can improve Do Not Disturb by meshing it with Notification Center.
* The concept basically allows you to enable and disable Do Not Disturb directly from Notification Center. As you can see from the animated GIF above, and the video embed, Do Not Disturb is activated by a simple “pull to refresh” of the Notification Center panel.
* From Sentry’s post on The Verge Forums:
* Sure, one can schedule DND to enable itself at a specific time of day, but that is hardly ideal for everyone, or in every scenario. So as usual, we find ourself going in and out of the Settings app simply to enable an iOS function.
* I wholeheartedly agree. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to venture into the Settings app when I needed to quickly enable Do Not Disturb. Unfortunately, there’s nothing “quick” about doing it this way, and that’s where Sentry’s concept comes into play.
* Although this is just a concept right now, and there’s no guarantee we’ll see it come to fruition, I think that considering the success of Auxo, the chances are quite high.
* What do you think about this concept? Would you use it?
