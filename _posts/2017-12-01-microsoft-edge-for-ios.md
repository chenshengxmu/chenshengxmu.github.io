* Microsoft has released their new Edge browser on iOS after a significant beta testing period. It allows you to easily pick up and leave off from your Windows 10 PC, similar to Apple’s Handoff.
* The Edge browser is an easy way for Windows users to feel more at home on iOS. Aside from being able to sync your browsing between your phone and PC, you also can sync your passwords, favorites, and reading lists.
* It also has a built-in QR code reader, a feature that just came to Apple’s default camera app with iOS 11.
* If voice control is your speed, you can easily browse with your voice.
* Lastly, it features an easy access private mode that won’t save any of your history or data.
* Edge is currently available on the App Store for free, as well as Android.
