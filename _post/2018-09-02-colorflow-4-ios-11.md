* A handful of jailbreak tweaks have been released in recent memory that colorize the Now Playing interface in iOS 11, but one of the newest is ColorFlow 4 (iOS 11) by iOS developer David Goldman.
* With ColorFlow 4 installed, the Now Playing interface adopts new color schemes that match the dominant colors of your album artwork. The animated GIF above depicts a few examples of how the tweak works on both the Lock screen and the native Music app.

* Note: given the simplicity of the preference pane, we haven’t included a screenshot of it here.
* ColorFlow 4 doesn’t change the fundamental functionality of iOS’ music-listening experience; instead, it merely complements it with beautiful colors. If you enjoy tasteful mods on your jailbroken iPhone or iPad, then the tweak could make an excellent addition to your handset.
* If you’re interested in trying ColorFlow 4 for yourself, then you can download it for $1.99 from Cydia’s Chariz/HASHBANG Productions repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices; anyone with iOS 10 or earlier should use ColorFlow 3.
