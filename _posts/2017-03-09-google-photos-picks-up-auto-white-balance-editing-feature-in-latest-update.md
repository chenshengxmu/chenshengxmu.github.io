* Google Photos for iPhone and iPad has picked up a brand new editing feature—auto white balance. Requiring Google Photos for iOS version 2.11, the app’s improved Auto Enhance tool now includes white balance correction that adjusts the white tone of your images to make them pop and given them a more natural look. Launch Google Photos on your device, select a look and the app will now correct not only exposure and saturation, but also automatically correct the white balance of the image.
* The auto white balance feature should come in handy for those times when you take a photo indoors that results in a yellowish tint or snap a scene outdoors on cloudy days, which often makes things look too cold and unnaturally blue.
* Before auto white balance, at left, and with white balance, at right.
