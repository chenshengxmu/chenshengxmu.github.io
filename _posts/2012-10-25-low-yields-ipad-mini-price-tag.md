* With so many people seemingly disappointed that the iPad mini starts at $329 rather than $249 or even $199, we polled you ahead of the announcement on the price and only seven percent thought only Apple could get away with pricing the device at $329. And yesterday, in another poll more than forty percent said they would be getting one (more than half would opt for the entry-level WiFi-only model).
* No question some people will go for a Nexus 7 or Amazon’s Kindle Fire because not everyone can afford a $300+ tablet. But why exactly Apple didn’t make a sub-$300 iPad? According to supply chain sources, low yields for touch screens are to blame…
* Per DigiTimes:
* The $329 price tag for Apple’s iPad mini is largely due to low yield rates for the device’s GF2 (DITO film) touch screen technology, according to industry sources.
* The sources said the DITO film sensor is having mass production issues, which has been a big contributor to why the device is approximately 40-50 percent more expensive compared to other seven-inch tablets that have OGS or G/G structures.
* The report goes on to note that GF2 touch screen modules are only five bucks cheaper than ones for the 9.7-inch iPad.
* It’s also interesting that iPad 2 orders “have a visibility until as late as the first quarter of 2013”, reportedly because the device is maintaining steady sales.
* We’ll see about that when pre-orders for the iPad mini start at midnight tonight.
