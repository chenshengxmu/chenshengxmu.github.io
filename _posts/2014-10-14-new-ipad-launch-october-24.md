* Apple is planning to launch its new iPads on October 24, according to a new report from MacRumors. Citing a reliable source, the outlet claims that the new tablets expected to be unveiled on Thursday will become available for purchase on Friday of the following week.
* The source told the site that Apple was shipping “mass quantities” of a new product to the United States, in preparation for the October 24 launch, although they did not specifically say iPads. That being said, given timing and context, the product is almost certainly tablets. 
* Apple last week invited members of the press to a low-key event at Town Hall on Thursday, October 16. While the day is an unusual one for the company, it does tend to launch newly unveiled products on Friday of the following week, lending credence to MacRumors’ story.
* It’s believed that Apple will use the event to unveil a more powerful iPad Air, with a thinner profile and higher resolution display. It’s also likely that we’ll see a refreshed iPad mini, new iMacs with Retina display, and iPod, Mac mini and Apple TV lines are all due for updates.
* Apple will be live streaming the keynote, and we of course will be covering all of the announcements here on iDB.
