* Evernote today released a new app for scanning various types of documents called Evernote Scannable. The app, which has been in beta for several months, is capable of scanning and managing contracts, receipts, business cards, and virtually any other kind of paper item you can think of.
* Scanning happens quickly and automatically. Simply load up the app and point your device’s camera at the document you want to scan in, and it will capture the image and make adjustments on the fly—such as rotating, cropping, sharpening, etc.—so your scans are clear and easy to read.
* Once an item is scanned in, you can choose to save it or send it. You can send documents to colleagues via email or text, or choose to save them to Evernote or other apps for archiving. You can even turned scanned business cards into contacts and pull information and photos from LinkedIn.

* Rounding out the app’s feature set is the ability to remotely control your desktop scanner. Those that have the Evernote Edition of the ScanSnap scanner can use the new Scannable app to pick what the device captures, and what it does with the scans, so you can drop paper in and walk away.
* While there are a number of scanning titles in the App Store, Evernote’s brand and ecosystem should help push this one to the top. If you’re an Evernote user, or are just curious about it and want to dip your toe in the water, you can find Scannable for iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free.
