* Who types text that is lengthy enough to warrant a character counter in the Notes app? That’s the first thing I thought when trying Characount for Notes, and needless to say I’m still pondering the question.
* That’s literally all this tweak does. It places a character counter, not a word counter mind you, but a character counter at the top of each note you compose.
* Who really needs something like this?
* Maybe one could compose 140 character tweets in the Notes app before copying and pasting them directly into a Twitter client…but that would just be really bizarre.
* If you’re interested, Characount for Notes can be had for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* You’re not honestly going to try it…are you?
