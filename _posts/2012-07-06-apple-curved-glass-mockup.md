* Curved cover glass could be the next big thing for portable devices. Apple reportedly invested in glass-cutting machines last year, fueling rumors that the iPhone 5 may feature a curved display akin to Nokia’s Lumia smartphones. The idea gained credence when Nick Bilton wrote in a New York Times article last December that Cupertino was working on “a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist”.
* We’re not so sure Apple would attach the iPod or iPhone brand to such an unusual gizmo, but if it resembles this exquisite concept, count us very excited…
* Italian designer Federico Ciccarese, who os credited with other awesome renders like this four-inch iPhone 5 mockup, today published absolutely gorgeous and totally intriguing renders depicting what a curved glass device from Apple might look like.

* What’s up with the metallic spidey legs, by the way?
* If that hideous watch band of sorts becomes a new thing ten years from now, I’ll be worried. Can someone give Jonny Ive a buzz?
* We’re eager to hear your impressions down in the comments.
