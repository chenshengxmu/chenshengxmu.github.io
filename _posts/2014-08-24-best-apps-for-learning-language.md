* I’ve learned three languages in addition to my native English over my lifetime. I took three years of Spanish in high school, two semesters of Mandarin in junior college, and four semesters of French in college. Guess what? I forgot everything. If you don’t use it, you lose it. Seriously.
* If you used to know multiple languages but forgot everything, want to brush up on a language you don’t get to use very often, or just want to learn a new one, we’ve got a list of what we think are the best apps for learning a new language.

* This is probably the most popular language-learning app in the App Store. There are still only a handful of languages available, but the lessons are incredibly broad. You will learn new terms every day, starting with basic words and phrases. After the lesson, you’ll be able to take a test to see how you progress. In the Practice section, compete against others to score the highest in the language test. This app is available for free.
