* MOGA has dropped the price of its ‘Ace Power’ iOS 7 gaming controller by 20%, bringing it down to $80 from $100. The move follows similar price drops by both Logitech and Strata on their respective MFi controllers, signaling a trend in the space.
* The Ace Power was the first of the iPhone-compatible game controllers to hit the market when it launched in November, and it features a d-pad, dual analog sticks, 4 action buttons/triggers, and a built-in 1800 mAh battery for recharging your device… From the press release (via MacRumors):
* “We wanted to let you know that as of this morning, the price of MOGA ACE POWER has been lowered to $79.99 MSRP in Apple Stores and most other retailers. These past few months have seen a huge influx of great controller-enabled iOS games onto the App Store, and to-date, MOGAAnywhere.com has curated a list of more than 120 of these games that now work with the MOGA ACE POWER controller.”
* TouchArcade went hands-on with the Ace Power:
* To be honest, this particular controller didn’t get very good initial review, but neither has any of the other MFi controllers we’ve seen thus far. The good news, though is that the list of iOS games compatible with these controllers is growing rather rapidly.
* If you’re interested, you can find the MOGA Ace Power in MOGA’s online store for $80. Apple’s online store also has the controller for sale, but hasn’t dropped the price yet. We’re not sure if this new pricing is permanent, or temporary like the Logitech.
