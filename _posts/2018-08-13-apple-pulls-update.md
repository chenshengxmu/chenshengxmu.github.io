* That was quick. Just hours after releasing the iOS 12 beta 7, Apple has pulled the over-the-air update. The decision came after some users reported having problems with the update. Developers can still download the update using the restore image found on the developer website. 
* If you’ve already installed the update OTA, your best bet is to wait for Apple to issue a fix and issue another update. Otherwise, you could download the restore image and reinstall the update via iTunes.
* In addition to iOS 12 beta 7, Apple on Monday released seventh betas for tvOS 12, watchOS 5, and macOS Mojave. The highlight of these betas is Apple’s decision to remove Group Facetime from iOS 12 and macOS Mojave. The heavily advertised new feature won’t launch under later in the fall.
* The first public releases for these updates should arrive as early as next month.
