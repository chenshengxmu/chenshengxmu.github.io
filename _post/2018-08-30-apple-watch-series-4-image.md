* On a day that already saw the first purported sighting of the 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch iPhone XS comes a new leak apparently showing the fourth generation Apple Watch. Also from 9to5Mac, the image shows Apple’s next wearable device with a larger display and brand new watch face.
* As you can see, the most significant change is the all-new edge-to-edge display found on the wearable device. Previous rumors had suggested Cupertino was increasing the size of the Apple Watch display by 15 percent. The new image seems to confirm this information.
* The watch face shown, however, is new. It appears to include eight complications around the time and within the clock hands. The changes seem to take advantage of the device’s larger display.
* Finally,  there’s a new hole between the modified side button and Digital Crown. 9to5Mac says this is likely an additional microphone.
* Assuming this leak is correct, it’s great to see that Apple is finally tweaking the look of its wearable device after three generations. It’s also nice knowing at least one new watch face could also be incoming. Give us more, Apple.
* As confirmed earlier in the day, Apple’s fall event is Wednesday, Sept. 12 beginning at 10 a.m. PDT. Besides three new iPhones and Apple Watch, the event should also showcase two new iPad Pro models. New Macs could also be announced.
