* Some features of Apple’s operating systems are hardware-dependent, for one reason or another. iOS 10 and macOS Sierra are no exceptions. For example, Raise to Wake on iOS 10 requires devices with Apple’s embedded M9 motion coprocessor, currently found in the iPhone 6s/Plus and iPhone SE.
* Following our preview of Auto Unlock, we noticed that commenters are wondering if this feature requires any special hardware so here are Apple’s official system requirements for Auto Unlock.
* Your devices and Apple ID must meet certain requirements for Auto Unlock.
* Auto Unlock requires the following:
* If your Mac was manufactured before 2013, you won’t be able to use Auto Unlock.
* If you’re unable to activate Auto Unlock, ensure that your Apple ID is protected with the more modern Two-Factor Authentication feature. Apple IDs that use the older and less reliable Two-Step Verification method cannot be used with Auto Unlock.
* TUTORIAL: how to set up and use Auto Unlock
* There’s no direct upgrade path for Two-Factor Authentication so if you’re using the older Two-Step Verification you must disable it before enrolling in Two-Factor Authentication.
* TUTORIAL: how to protect your Apple ID with Two-Factor Authentication
* See our Auto Unlock preview for detailed information about how this feature works, then learn how to set up Auto Unlock on your Mac and Apple Watch.
* You can find more information about Two-Step Verification in Apple’s FAQ.
