* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected today to approve an investigation into so-called patent trolls, according to the New York Times. Results of the investigation could be used as part of a possible antitrust lawsuit.
* FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez has said the technology involved in one smartphone could spur thousands of patents. In 2012, patent trolls – politely referred to as patent-assertion entities – comprised 60 percent of some 4,000 patent lawsuits. In 2011, the number of patent lawsuits were half that amount, the Times reported…
* The likely approval of an FTC probe comes after U.S. President Barack Obama issued a number of executive orders in order to “protect innovators from frivolous litigation.”
* The Patent and Trademark agency, for instance, was told to better disclose who owns a patent. Among the questions the FTC probe is likely to ask is how much of the licensing fees the PAEs return to actual patent holders, the newspaper reports.
* Along with having the power to subpoena companies, the FTC probe could provide ammunition to government investigators looking to file antitrust lawsuits against the trolls, as well as assist Congress.
* Among targets of the likely FTC investigation: both shell companies that simply flood technology firms warning of patent infringement and patent trolls that purchase huge portfolios that then are wielded for profit.
* According to today’s report, companies will be asked whether there is any collusion among patent trolls, a question that could open them to antitrust action.
* The subject of patents is a hot topic in Silicon Valley. A firm’s patent portfolio could be seen both as an attractive property by potential suitors as well as a powerful weapon in court.
* Nortel’s many patents drew the attention of Apple, among other technology giants. Apple also used its considerable library of patents to attack rival Samsung.
* The most recent example of the power of patents and how valuable experts in the field are to patent trolls, Apple’s patent chief – who first alerted Steve Jobs and Tim Cook to Samsung’s alleged infringement – this week joined Technicolor, a French patent troll.
