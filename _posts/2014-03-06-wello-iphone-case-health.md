* Rumor has it that Apple’s so-called iWatch will be capable of reading your blood pressure, heart rate and other vital signs. But you may not have to wait until its release to purchase such a device. Meet the ‘Wello,’ the all-in-one health-tracking iPhone case.
* The Wello has built-in sensors that can give you a picture of your overall health after holding it for just a few seconds. It measures heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and blood oxygen levels—and can even test your lung function via a small attachment…

* Engadget recently went hands-on with a prototype of the device:
* “Designed to be both fast and simple to use, the prototype we tried out this week was ultra-light, and thinner than the Speck case on one of our iPhones. Readings are done with your hands in a comfortable position, and the health tracker was able to return our vital signs as well as a fancy ECG graph of our heart in just a few seconds. Out of the box, you’ll be able to pair it with your Wi-Fi scale and fitness tracker, so you can keep an overall picture of your health in the same place. Over time, additional add-ons could become available for the case to test for other things like glucose. Everything you track can be viewed on a daily, weekly, or monthly scale so you can see at a glance if your health starts to change.”
* The technology being used here is very impressive, and extremely relevant right now. Intel just acquired health-tracking-startup Basis, Samsung is adding heart rate sensors to anything it can, and Apple is hiring doctors, scientists and other medical experts.

* The Wello is currently pending FDA approval, but when it ships it will support the iPhone 4s, 5 and 5s with a price tag of $199. Pre-orders start today in the US, Canada and other countries, and early buyers can earn $10 for each person they can get to pre-order.
