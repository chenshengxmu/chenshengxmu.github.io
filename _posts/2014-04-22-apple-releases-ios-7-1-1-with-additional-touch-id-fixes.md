* Apple has just released iOS 7.1.1 for public consumption. A maintenance update, iOS 7.1.1 contains “improvements, bug fixes and security updates.” Specifically, it makes Touch ID even more reliable than the previous iOS 7.1 update, while fixing a pair of bugs related to keyboard responsiveness and Bluetooth keyboards with VoiceOver enabled.
* It’s arrived just five days after iOS 7.1.1 devices located in and around Apple’s Cupertino campus started exposing themselves in web logs.
* Needless to say, those of you who rock a jailbroken iPhone, iPod touch or iPad are advised to hold off on upgrading to the new software until we’re able to confirm it won’t break your jailbreak…
* Firmware files are available on our Download page.
* According to the official changelog, iOS 7.1.1 – labeled as build 11D201 – contains improvements, bug fixes and security updates, including:
* – Further improvements to Touch ID fingerprint recognition – Fixes a bug that could impact keyboard responsiveness – Fixes an issue when using Bluetooth keyboards with VoiceOver enabled
* You can apply an over-the-air update by visiting iOS Settings > General > Software Update. From there, hit the Download and Install button and follow the instructions. You must be connected to a Wi-Fi network in order to download the update.

* Alternatively, connect your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad via a USB cable to iTunes and apply the update using your Mac or Windows PC.
* For me, the installer comes in at a rather paltry 26MB, but your mileage may vary depending on your device model and the version of iOS installed.
* For detailed info on the security content of this update, check out this support doc.
* A companion Apple TV 6.1.1 update is also available on your set-top box.
* According to early reports on Twitter, Touch ID recognition is now markedly faster than before. You’ll probably need to re-register your fingerprints in order to get Touch ID to recognize them faster than before in iOS 7.1.1.
* Safari now supports new top-level domains like .photo, .camera and more. Also, as a commenter pointed out (and proved me wrong in the process), the App Store in iOS 7.1.1 now appropriately labels items that contain In-App subscriptions.

* I originally assumed this was a backend iTunes update, but subsequent checks have confirmed that IAP labels show up in iOS 7.1.1 but not in iOS 7.1.
* Should you spot other noteworthy improvements, please do share them with the community down in the comments and I’ll update the article accordingly.
