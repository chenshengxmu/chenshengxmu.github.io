* Anyone still rocking a jailbroken iOS 10 device regardless of the possibility of an iOS 11 jailbreak in the not-too-distant future will be happy to know that some developers continue to make jailbreak tweaks for iOS 10.
* One of the latest releases is NotificationsHeaderCustomText by iOS developer CydiaGeek, and as the name implies, this tweak lets you customize Notification Center’s header text string, as shown above.
* In our example, we’ve changed the stock “Missed” text string to “Read These ASAP!” instead. Obviously, you don’t have to use the same text string we did; you can set it to anything you’d prefer.
* To make the changes you desire, you’ll need to visit the NotificationsHeaderCustomText preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you can:
* The developer even includes a Respring button for saving your changes. You should use it every time you modify Notification Center’s header text or change any of the other settings.
* Admittedly, NotificationsHeaderCustomText is a bit trivial because you don’t see Notification Center all the time. Nevertheless, it’s a form of personal customization for your iPhone or iPad, which serves as a testament to the capabilities of jailbreaking that many of us take for granted every day.
* If you’d like to try NotificationsHeaderCustomText for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* What will you change your Notification Center header text to with this tweak? Share in the comments below.
