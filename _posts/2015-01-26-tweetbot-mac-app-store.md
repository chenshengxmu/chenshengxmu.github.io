* Tapbots, the maker of popular third-party Twitter application Tweebot, has brought back the application to the Mac App Store after pulling it over the weekend.
* “We’ve worked with Twitter to resolve Tweetbot for Mac authentication issues,” Tapbots said in a tweet on Monday. “The app should be back on the Mac App Store soon.” 
* Tweetbot was pulled from the App Store after the application was no longer accepting new logins, a tell-tale sign that Tweetbot for Mac had reached its token limit. Users whose account were already authenticated could get past the re-authentication screen be deleting the “force_login=TRUE” text in the URL after entering their Twitter credentials.
* Twitter has been taking a lot of heat since it began limiting the number of tokens issued to third-party clients in August 2012. Some fans interpreted the move as a sign that the micro-blogging startup wants to get rid of Twitter clients in favor of its own official web and mobile app.
* You can download Tweetbot from the Mac App Store for $19.
