* AT&T is at it again. Adding to its list of acquisitions, the company announced today that it will be purchasing regional carrier Long Lines Wireless. The telco has coverage throughout the midwest and owns some valuable spectrum licenses.
* The news comes just a little over two weeks after AT&T announced it would be acquiring prepaid carrier Leap Wireless. And the company says the move is to help it improve its 3G and LTE network coverage in areas within Long Lines’ footprint…
* From the letter LL is sending out to its subscribers posted by TeleGeography (via iClarified):
* “Long Lines is committed to providing the best value and most reliable service in the industry and we are always looking at ways to improve the services we off. Today we announce that Long Lines has agreed to sell its wireless network assets and transfer its Long Lines Wireless subscribers to AT&T Mobility.
* The transaction will give Long Lines Wireless subscribers access to high-quality wireless services access and access to AT&T’s award winning 4G LTE mobile network. We are excited about the opportunities for our subscribers to get better device choices and the latest 4G mobile technologies.”
* Long Lines has been serving the Siouxland area since 1944. It offers both wireless and wired services, including high-speed Internet and TV. The carrier says that the buyout only involves its wireless assets, so it won’t affect its wired business.
* AT&T expects the deal to close in late 2013 or early 2014. At which time, it will gain access to Long Lines’ 700 MHz, PCS and AWS spectrum licenses, which will help it get LTE into a number of areas in Iowa, North/South Dakota and more.
