* The volume HUD in iOS has always left a lot to be desired; it pops up in the center of the screen and then seemingly lingers for an eternity, all while getting in the way of everything, whether you’re watching videos, looking at photos, browsing the web, or doing anything else while trying to change your device’s volume level.
* A new jailbreak tweak called Sonus by ubik is just one of many attempts to make the volume HUD better in iOS, and unlike much of the competition out there, it has a lot of options that you can take advantage of to deck out the tweak and make it look and feel the way you want it to.
* Starting with the obvious, Sonus takes your volume HUD and relocates it to the top of the screen, where your Status Bar normally appears. Here, the volume indicator is out of the way and doesn’t hinder your ability to do anything on your screen.
* As you adjust the volume on your device, a surprisingly fluid volume indicator bar illustrates your current volume level with the following animation:

* It doesn’t stop there, however. Sonus also has the ability to work as a volume adjustment slider whenever the volume HUD appears. When it does, you can opt to have a grabber appear on the indicator that lets you adjust the volume via the touch screen once you’ve already got the HUD open.
* Sonus will provide users with a bevy of options for customizing the way the volume HUD looks and feels, so if you’re not happy with the way it looks out of the box, then you can go ahead and make the tweak look exactly how you want it to. To do that, just go to the tweak’s preferences pane, which can be found in the Settings app after installation:

* As you can probably tell, there are quite a few different settings cells in the Sonus preferences pane. We’ll go through all of the cells with you in the outline below:

* Appearance
* The first preferences pane has to do with the volume HUD’s appearance. This pane gives you options for all of the following:
* Size and Position
* Another preferences pane is dedicated to the sizing and positioning of the volume HUD, and it provides you with the following options:
* Animation
* The next preferences pane has to do with the tweak’s animations, and offers these options to choose from:
* Extras
* The Extra preferences pane offers a variety of miscellaneous options that are find to play with, including:
* Experimental
* The last preferences pane is for experimental options, which work, but may be buggy because they’re still in preliminary development.

* The things you can configure here include:
* At a first glance, the tweak looks and feels a lot like SmartVolumeControl, but it has such a sleeker UI, but with a far more satisfying UI and stronger set of configuration options.
* The idea of changing the volume HUD so that it appears in the Status Bar region rather than smack in the middle of the screen certainly isn’t new, but the deep levels of customization that Sonus has to offer help to make it stand out from a lot of the competition. They help to make the tweak a good fit for anyone, as anyone can form the tweak around their personal desires and needs.
* Sonus is made to work on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices, whether they’re iPhones, iPads, or iPod touches. It’s also worth noting that the tweak supports both landscape and portrait orientations, which not all volume HUD replacement tweaks do.
