* Anyone looking for a quicker way of dismissing unwanted notification badges from their app icons without having to open the app in question might want to turn their attention to a new free jailbreak tweak release called ClearBadges3DTouch10 by HiDaN.
* As the self-explanatory name implies, this tweak is intended to give you a way to remove notification badges from your apps with a 3D Touch gesture.
* The tweak works seamlessly with the rest of your Home screen’s 3D Touch experience. The developer built the tweak into one of Apple’s stock interfaces so that it blends in, making it look and feel just like something Apple themselves added to your device.
* When you use a 3D Touch gesture on one of your apps with a notification badge, you’ll see a new option in the 3D Touch menu (along with any others that existed before) that allows you to clear the badge from the app icon, as shown above. After you tap on it, the badge instantly disappears from the icon.
* Without any options to configure, ClearBadges3DTouch10 is a simple tweak you need only install from Cydia and can start using right out of the box. It doesn’t get much simpler than than folks!
* While it’s designed for devices that have a 3D Touch display, you can still use the tweak on a non-3D Touch device with 3D Touch simulation tweaks like Peek-a-Boo, as they will allow you to access the 3D Touch menus on the Home screen even if you don’t have a 3D Touch display on your device.
* If you’re interested in trying ClearBadges3DTouch10, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. It’s intended to work on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
