* Apple is recruiting experts in automotive technology and vehicle design to work at a new top-secret research lab, Financial Times reported on Friday. Among the new-hires is former president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development Johann Jungwirth.
* Citing several insider sources, the outlet says Apple set up the new research lab late last year at a confidential Silicon Valley location. And it’s believed that the facility is being used by a team, led by experienced iPhone managers, to research new automotive products.
* One theory is that these products include an “advanced software platform” for car-makers that builds on CarPlay. But others feel that the background of the auto-experts being hired and the level of seniority involvement suggest something much bigger is in the works.
* “Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,” a well-informed source told Financial Times’ Tim Bradshaw. “Today I think it’s a car.” The person added that Jony Ive and his design team have been holding meetings with auto execs and engineers in recent months.
* The news comes as rumors of Apple’s interest in the automotive industry are beginning to intensify. Last week a camera-equipped vehicle registered to the firm was spotted driving around San Francisco, followed by reports it’s engaged in a poaching war with Tesla Motors.
