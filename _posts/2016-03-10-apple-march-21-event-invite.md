* Following weeks of speculation, Apple on Thursday sent out invites for a media event later this month that should serve as a launchpad for new iPhone and iPad models, Apple Watch bands and possibly more.
* The press event will be held at Apple’s Cupertino campus on Monday, March 21, 2016, at 10:00am PT, and will be live-streamed using HTTP Live Streaming.
* As you may have guessed, iDownloadBlog will continue covering everything there’s to know about about Apple’s product refreshes.
* BuzzFeed News notes that the event will occur one day prior to Apple’s March 22 showdown with the U.S. government over a motion that would compel it to create a backdoor to hack into an iPhone 5c that was used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.
* The event will be live-streamed via apple.com/apple-events/march-2016.
* Live streaming uses Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology which requires Safari on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later, Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or newer, or the Microsoft Edge browser on Windows 10.
* Streaming via the Apple TV requires a second or third-generation Apple TV with software 6.2 or later or a fourth-generation Apple TV.
* The invite graphics will no doubt prompt Kremlinologists out there to try to decipher which products might get announced at the event.
* Based on the colors and name, iDownloadBlog reader James Baney thinks we might see Gold and Rose Gold Milanese Loops for the Apple Watch.
* And what’s your read of the invite graphics?
* Invite graphics via The Loop.
