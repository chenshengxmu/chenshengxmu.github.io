* An exciting new jailbreak tweak is on the horizon, and it looks extremely promising for those of you who have multiple accounts for service based apps like Instagram. Slices is an upcoming tweak that will allows you to create multiple settings and user bundles for applications, effectively allowing you to have multiple user profiles for any app on a single device.
* Developer Steve Hetelekides has previewed his upcoming tweak on YouTube, and we have the full video inside for you to check out. Trust me, you don’t want to miss this.
* I have to say that after watching that video, I’m uber-excited about Slices. It looks like one of the most promising, innovative, and truly useful jailbreak tweaks we’ve seen in quite some time.

* If you watched the video, you can see that Slices won’t just allow you to have multiple Instagram profiles on the same device, but you can also play games with multiple settings and user bundles. Slices looks to be extremely useful for virtually any application, especially if you could derive some benefit from, what is essentially, running multiple instances of the same app.
* Users will be able to create slices, name their slices, and switch between multiple slices for the same app. Each slice can be managed within the tweak’s preferences. If an app features notifications, notifications will only occur for the current slice you have enabled for any specific application.
* We’ll definitely be keeping our eyes and ears out for more information regarding slices. We’ve reached out to Steve, so hopefully we’ll be able to get a hands-on preview of the tweak and put it through its paces. In the meantime, you can check out Steve’s post on r/jailbreak for more information.
