* Though it isn’t a secret that Apple is planning on launching their rumored “iCloud” service at WWDC next month, it still is just speculation. The Cupertino company has been fairly silent regarding the upcoming project.
* But if you look at the trail of petabyte purchases and music industry leaks, it’s not hard to figure out what’s going on. As more details emerge on Apple’s quest to acquire licenses for their new service, evidence seems stronger than ever that iCloud is WWDC-bound…
* Why’s everyone talking about Apple’s new cloud service? The company’s choice to secure licenses from record labels is expected to give Apple’s service a large advantage over the competitors, not to mention deep iOS integration.
* As Apple continues its talks with major record labels, more information continues to leak from inside the music industry. According to the gossip, the iPhone makers recently reached an agreement with Sony Corp.
* This would leave Apple with just one more major label, the Universal Music Group, to reach an accord with. Word on the street is Apple also has to get permission from the labels’ accompanying publishing partners, but that isn’t expected to be a difficult task.
* Either way it looks like Apple will have everything in order to at least announce the service next month at their developer’s conference. With Google and Amazon already having such a head start, could Apple really afford not to?
* What do you think? Are you excited about Apple’s cloud service?
