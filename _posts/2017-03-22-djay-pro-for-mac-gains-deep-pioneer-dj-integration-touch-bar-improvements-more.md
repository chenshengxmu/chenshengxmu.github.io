* Algoriddim’s Apple Design Award-winning djay Pro for macOS was updated on Mac App Store today with Pioneer DJ integration and other improvements. The app is now officially certified by Pioneer DJ to be used with their high end gear, including CDJ-2000NXS2/Tour setups via plug and play. “To our knowledge, djay Pro is the first third-party app to support Pioneer DJ’s Pro DJ Link technology, which means users connect up to four CDJs with their Pioneer mixer and control djay Pro through a single USB cable (mixer to Mac),” Algoriddim’s Michael Simmons told me in an email message.
* “djay Pro is the most modern way to DJ on your Mac,” said Algoriddim CEO Karim Morsy.
* “This new version adds a host of new features for live performance, music discovery, and preparation. It combines the best of both worlds, content discovery via Spotify and hardware access through Pioneer DJ’s state-of-the-art CDJ setups.”
* The app’s seamless plug-and-play integration with CDJ-2000NXS2 and TOUR1, the worldwide club standard for professional DJs, lets you access Spotify and iTunes playlists directly from the CDJ screens, including displaying colored waveforms, song information and cue points.
* Also notable: the ability to connect multiple CDJs with a single USB cable (LAN Link).
* Using LAN Link, you can connect up to four CDJ-2000NXS2 players with a DJM-900NXS2 mixer via LAN cables. After connect your Mac to the mixer via a single USB cable, everything will syncs seamlessly including your CDJ-TOUR1 players and DJM-TOUR1.

* “Together with the mixer’s built-in audio interface, this means that a single USB connection powers both audio and HID control, resulting in unprecedented simplicity for setup,” said developers.
* Users can also access the full Spotify catalog directly via their CDJ screens, including Spotify’s all-new Browse section with extensive curated content. This lets you mix curated playlists and instantly discover new music by mood, genre and popularity.
* If you happen to own Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro, you’ll be pleased to learn that this edition of djay Pro for Mac comes some nice Touch Bar improvements giving you quick access to the app’s new library and mixer modes, manual deck selection and other commonly-used features.
* Users can now take advantage of the Touch Bar feature to manipulate two decks simultaneously, manually select the active deck and to navigate the library to browse, preview and prepare songs, all with the touch of their finger.
