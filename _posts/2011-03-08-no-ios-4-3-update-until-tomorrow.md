* We reported earlier today that Apple’s iOS 4.3 would be available for download at 10:00 A.M. PST. Well that time has come and gone and MacRumors is reporting that the early release will actually occur tomorrow. They’ve posted  a screen shot (see above) from one of their MacRumors readers, chatting with an Apple representative.
* The screen shot confirms what LoopInsight reported this morning: there is to be no iOS 4.3 release today. But the speculation of iOS coming early still seems to be solid, it’s just been off by a day. We will definitely let you know as soon as the download goes live, or if anything else breaks in this story… 
* Is the suspense killing anyone? Stay tuned!
