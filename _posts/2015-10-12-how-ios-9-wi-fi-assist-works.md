* Wi-Fi Assist, a new feature in iOS 9, was initially met with some skepticism as Apple did a lousy job detailing how it works beyond stating that Wi-Fi Assist automatically uses cellular data when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor.
* “With Wi-Fi Assist, you can stay connected to the Internet even if you have a poor Wi-Fi connection,” the iPhone maker said somewhat critically.
* However, inexperienced users might encounter some unwanted effects when using their devices in areas with low Wi-Fi signal because Wi-Fi Assist will activate their carrier’s mobile data network and therefore possibly lead to increased data consumption and unwanted overage fees on the wireless bill.
* Here’s what Apple is saying how Wi-Fi exactly works.
* “Because you’ll stay connected to the Internet over cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, you might use more cellular data,” cautions the firm.
* “For most users, this should only be a small percentage higher than previous usage,” reads Apple’s support document.
* Most first and third-party apps (but not all, see further below for more info) work with Wi-Fi Assist enabled. Stock apps like Safari, Apple Music, Maps, Mail and more will try to use Wi-Fi Assist if iOS detects very slow or unreliable Wi-Fi connection.
* “For example, if you’re using Safari with a poor Wi-Fi connection and a webpage doesn’t load, Wi-Fi Assist will activate and automatically switch to cellular so that the webpage continues to load,” states the company.
* Yes, Wi-Fi Assist is on by default. As mentioned, those on a metered data plan might want to disable Wi-Fi Assist unless they are OK with their iPhone staying connected to the Internet via mobile data when Wi-Fi is in an extremely weak state.
* Full tutorial: How to enable and disable Wi-Fi Assist
* You can disable Wi-Fi Assist by going to Settings → Cellular (or Settings → Mobile Data and flipping the Wi-Fi Assist button at the bottom to the OFF position.

* Thankfully, Apple’s wisely designed Wi-Fi Assist to ensure that it doesn’t automatically switch to your carrier’s cellular network when you’re data roaming.
* No, and that’s by design. Apple states that the feature only works when you have apps running in the foreground and doesn’t activate with background downloading of content.
* To further optimize cellular data consumption, Wi-Fi Assist won’t kick into action when certain audio and video-streaming apps attempt to use large amounts of data. It will also prevent downloading of attachments in email apps.
* Wi-Fi Assist is supported on any iPhone from the iPhone 5 and onward. On cellular-enabled iPads, Wi-Fi Assist will work on any model with iOS 9 or later except for the cellular-capable iPad 2, third-generation iPad and the original iPad mini.
* As for iPod touches, Apple’s media player lacks cellular connectivity and as such won’t expose the Wi-Fi Assist switch in mobile data settings.
* When Wi-Fi Assist is enabled and iOS detects a poor Wi-Fi signal, the feature is automatically activated. You will know that Wi-Fi Assist has activated when the status bar turns gray before one of the symbols for cellular data appear.
