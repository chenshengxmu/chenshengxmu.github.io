* Apple has aired a new ad tonight for its all-new iPhone 5c handset. The spot is entitled ‘Plastic Perfected,’ and it focuses on the device’s bright colors and the polycarbonate material used to make its outer casing.
* The commercial is a significant departure from Apple’s recent TV adverts, as it features no dialogue or voiceover. All you hear is a catchy song play in the background as you watch liquid morph into the iPhone 5c…

* Apple unveiled the iPhone 5c at a media event in Cupertino last week. Made of plastic, with iPhone 5 innards, the device has received criticism for being priced just $100 less than the company’s flagship phone.
* And that criticism turned into skepticism today, when Apple failed to report any sales numbers for the 5c pre-order weekend. Many believe the missing press release means that the handset isn’t selling very well.
* That theory, however, doesn’t mesh with device inventory, as a number of 5c models are showing shipping delays. It’ll be interesting to see if Apple speaks up this week, or after the launch Friday, about its performance.
* Until then, what’d you think of the new iPhone 5c ad?
