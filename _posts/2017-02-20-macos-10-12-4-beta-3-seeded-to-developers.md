* Aside from watchOS 3.2 beta 3, tvOS 10.2 beta 3 and iOS 10.3 beta 3 with a new name and shame list for legacy apps,  Apple today seeded a third beta of what would become the fourth major update to Sierra since its launch last fall. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 3 (build 16E163f) with Night Shift Mode and other perks is now available to registered developers.
* You can deploy the latest beta over the air on your Mac through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. Today’s release is only for developers but a version aimed at public beta testers should drop in the next 24 hours.
* “The macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac,” according to Apple’s official release notes accompanying the download.
* Night Shift Mode, introduced on iPhone with iOS 9, is coming to your Mac.
* On iOS devices, Night Shift lets you adjust the display’s temperature from cool to warm based on the time of day. On your Mac, Night Shift works pretty much the same way.
* With Night Shift Mode, your Mac’s display gradually shifts from blue to yellow to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is believed to cause sleeping problems.
* You can access Night Shift in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri.
* Aside from Night Shift, the forthcoming software update brings Dictation support for Shanghainese, an updated PDF API that fixed some annoying bugs and iCloud Analytics options.

* Lastly, Siri on macOS Sierra 10.12.4 is able to look up Cricket schedules, scores and rosters for two new cricket leagues.
* Will you be using Night Shift mode on your Mac when 10.12.4 drops?
