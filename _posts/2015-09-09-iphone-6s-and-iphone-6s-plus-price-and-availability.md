* Apple’s just-announced iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available for pre-order on Saturday, September 12th, and ship on September 25th. The iPhone 6s starts at $199 on contract, while the iPhone 6s Plus will be available for $100 more at $299 on contract. Both phones start with 16GB of flash storage space, and as Apple has done for many years now, price increases occur incrementally based on the amount of flash storage.

* But that’s not all, Apple is also well aware of the carrier trend towards installment plans instead of two-year contracts. In a slide, Apple showcased a typical installment payment example for all of the iPhones in its line. With a typical carrier installment plan, a customer with good credit can score an iPhone 6s Plus with 16GB of flash storage for $31 a month.
* Apple is also, for the first time, introducing a new program called the iPhone Upgrade Program. This is a program that’s available to Apple’s U.S. customers, which will allow iPhone owners to upgrade to a new device every year. The iPhone is unlocked, includes AppleCare+ coverage, and starts at $32 a month. We’ll have more details on this plan in a separate post.

* Keep in mind that the on-contract prices mentioned are fully subsidized. The real price for the entry-level 16GB iPhone 6s is $649.99, and the price increases by $100 with each storage space increase. The iPhone 6s Plus starts at $749.99 and also increases by $100 with each storage tier upgrade.

* The current-gen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have be reduced in price by $100 to make room for the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The oldest iPhone in the lineup, the iPhone 5s, will now be Apple’s entry level phone offering overall. As such, it will be available free with a two-year carrier contract.
* There’s not much surprising about the pricing structure for this year’s iPhones. Yes, it’s a bit disappointing that 16GB iPhones still exist, especially with 4K video shooting capabilities, but at least we were expecting this to be the case.
* What do you think about the iPhone’s pricing strategy? Will you be preordering the new iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus on Saturday?
