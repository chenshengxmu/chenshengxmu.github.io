* Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference is a hodgepodge of long lines, major announcements, and free stuff. Those who are lucky enough to attend the event are usually greeted with a bag of promotional goodies.
* This year, in addition to their usual WWDC badges and jackets, attendees are being given a free $25 App Store gift card. It’s in celebration of the Conference’s 25th year anniversary, and the card reads “25 years and coding.”
* Here’s a photo of the card via WWDC 2014 scholarship winner Harrison Weinerman:
