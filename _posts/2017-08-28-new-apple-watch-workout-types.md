* Apple Watch may soon gain the ability to track a variety of new activity types via the Workout app on watchOS 4, including boxing, dancing, kickboxing, lacrosse, pilates, skating and more.
* That’s according to Brazilian outlet iHelp.br which this weekend discovered (Google Translate) the iconography in the latest version of iOS 11 beta for a variety of new workout types, many of which are not currently present in the most recent watchOS 4 beta.
* As the outlet noted, those icons will likely ship as part of iOS 11 so that users could review the new activity types in the companion Watch app on a paired iPhone.
* The publication found icons and code strings for the following activities:
* Some of those activities can be found under the “Other” genre in the Workout app on watchOS 4, where you can tailor a generic workout to your needs and save it as a list of things like tennis, gymnastics and more. However, those are just some labels to help you identify your Other workouts and as such don’t have any impact on the metrics used to track a workout.
* Apple has said that watchOS 4 will expand the available workouts to include auto-sets for pool swim workouts, support for high intensity interval training and more.
* Evidence of the new skiing workout was previously discovered in the HomePod firmware.
