* Slingshot, Facebook’s weird ephemeral messaging app, is actually getting better and more useful with each update.
* After releasing a major 2.0 version rebuilt from the ground up and enriched with such new features as private reactions, photo filters, drawings, emojis and notifications on a per-contact basis.
* Today’s update keeps smoothing out the remaining few rough edges.
* For instance, you can now switch smoothly between your iPhone’s front-facing FaceTime camera for ‘selfies’ and the iSight camera out the back for ‘fronties’ by swiping left and right.
* The team has also enhanced the friend-finding feature and fixed a few unspecified but no doubt annoying bugs. As a reminder, Slingshot doesn’t require a Facebook account though you can log in with Facebook, if you want.
* More importantly, as of 2.0 refresh you are no longer required to sling something back before you can see what a contact originally slung to you.
* Matter of fact, you don’t need to sling anything at all to enjoy some of the most popular slings in the Explore section of the People tab.
* Slingshot 2.0.1 changelog:
* The iPhone-only app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Slingshot free in the App Store.
