* We’ve covered it in the past, but GridTab for Safari was recently updated with iOS 5 compatibility, so we thought it was a great time to bring you a video walkthrough of this exceptional tweak.
* The purpose of GridTab is simple — to improve the tabbed browsing experience in Mobile Safari. Does it achieve its goal in doing so? Check inside for the answer…
* GridTab for Safari greatly improves the multi-browser window experience in Mobile Safari, in fact, I’m sad that Apple hasn’t already adopted a similar style for the stock Safari browser.
* The grid layout adopted by GridTab for Safari makes it much easier to see what you have open when compared to the “cover flow” style that Apple uses by default.
* If you want a better tabbed browsing experience, and your iDevice is jailbroken, you can head over to Cydia and download GridTab for Safari for $1.50. It’s recently been updated for iOS 5 compatibility, so you shouldn’t experience any issues getting it to work on your device.
* Let me know what you think about it in the comment section below.
