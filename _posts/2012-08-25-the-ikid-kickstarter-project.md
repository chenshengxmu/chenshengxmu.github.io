* One of the great things about the iPad is the fact that it’s so easy to use, a toddler could use it. In fact, they do use it. Recent studies show that roughly 40% of children ages 2-4 have used an iPad or similar device.
* But unless you want to put the fate of your $500 tablet in the hands of a two-year old, you better put a case on it. Unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot of choices out there that are kid-friendly. Enter the iKid…
* The iKid is billed as a shock absorbing iPad case built for kids. It’s very durable, and is outlined with four easy-grip handles. It also has an optional home key protector, and an opening for the dock connector.
* The iKid is obviously a Kickstarter project, and is currently sitting at $2,449 of its $7000 goal. The developer, Laura Graham, has already done the leg work and is raising money to start production.
* If you have kids that like to play games or watch videos on your iPad, something like this seems like a no-brainer. The only question mark here seems to be build-quality, but at $30, it’s not much of a gamble.
* What do you think of the iKid, good idea/bad idea?
