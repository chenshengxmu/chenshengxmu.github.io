* Apple on Friday announced that its Apps for Earth campaign has generated more than $8 million in total proceeds. For 10 days in April, the iPhone maker worked with 24 developers to publish interactive and educational content to the App Store, with the proceeds going exclusively to the World Wildlife Fund.
* THANK YOU! $8 million raised through @AppStore‘s #AppsforEarth will advance conservation! https://t.co/zEqygxYJUx

* Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the WWF: “Apps for Earth proved small actions really can equal big change. This campaign boosts our efforts to protect the world’s forests, oceans, fresh water and wildlife, and combat the dual threats of climate change and unsustainable food production. Our work rests on engaging hundreds of millions around the world – to understand our profound reliance on the Earth and to act to protect the natural world that supports all of us. 
* I was blown away by the devotion that Apple and the 24 developers brought to this campaign. Their creativity and heroic effort brought our mission and our work into people’s lives at an enormous scale. It is our hope that Apps for Earth has left a permanent mark on everyone who participated and inspires a new wave of conservationists.”
* For those who don’t recall the promotion, Apple posted an Apps for Earth banner atop its App Store and featured several participating apps like VSCO, Procreate Pocket, Enlight and even Kendall and Kylie. These apps changed their icons to WWF graphics, and donated 100% of select IAP revenue to the cause.
* The World Wildlife Fund was founded in 1961, and its missions are in the field of wilderness preservation, and the reduction of humanity’s footprint on the environment.
