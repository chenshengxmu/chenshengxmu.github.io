* Apple on Monday issued updates for GarageBand on both iOS and Mac, bringing the apps to version 2.1.1 and 10.1.2 respectively. The release notes for the updates mention various bug fixes and other improvements, but Apple points to some bigger changes in a press release.
* Many new Chinese sounds were also added in today’s GarageBand updates, to “celebrate the rich history of Chinese music.” This includes traditional Chinese instruments like the pipa and erhu, percussion instruments like wood blocks and cymbals, and 300 Live Loops.
* GarageBand is the most popular music creation app in the world and we’re excited to introduce these new features that incorporate the rich history of traditional Chinese music,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Product Marketing. “By adding classic Chinese instruments and new Live Loop templates, the new GarageBand app makes it fun and easy to make Chinese-inspired music right on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.”
* “As a musician I’m always looking for ways to take my music in new directions and GarageBand has been such a great tool for me to experiment and add new elements to my songs on-the-go,” said award-winning music artist JJ Lin. “I love how the latest update to GarageBand adds traditional Chinese instruments along with brand new loops so I can play around with mixing traditional and modern sounds to create completely new styles.”
* Amidst dwindling iPhone sales and multiple iTunes Store shutdowns, Apple has ramped up its efforts in China. Last week, the company announced that it had made a $1 billion investment in ride sharing service Didi Chuxing, and Tim Cook is currently on business in the country.
* You can download the latest version of GarageBand in the App Store and Mac App Store, for $4.99.
