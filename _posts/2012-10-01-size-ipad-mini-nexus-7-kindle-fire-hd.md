* With the iPad mini presser all but confirmed (think October 17) and today’s report that Foxconn is now assembling the device at its new facilities in Brazil, a set of handy new images surfaced that help compare the rumored 7.85-inch iPad mini to Amazon’s and Google’s tablets, with size and form factor in mind.
* If a series of side-by-side comparison shots depicting how an unreleased device stacks up against real tablets is to be trusted, the iPad mini should be slightly wider than Google’s and a tad taller than Amazon’s…
* The images (via French blog NowhereElse) depict the 7.85-inch iPad mini next to Google’s Nexus seven-incher and Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD.
* Here’s another image that compares the iPad mini versus the regular iPad, iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S.

* Don’t freak out over the lack of tapered edges on the mini iPad because you’re really looking at a dummy someone in Asia created based on the rumors.
* NowhereElse has 21 images in total so check out the source link if you’re hungry for more.
* What do you think, is this mini iPad going to eat everyone’s lunch?
