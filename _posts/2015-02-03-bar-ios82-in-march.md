* Tuesday, BGR said it’s learned from its own sources that Apple is shooting to release iOS 8.2 around March, ahead of the Apple Watch launch in April. “A trusted source” privy to Apple’s most recent roadmap told the technology blog that Apple isn’t planning to release iOS 8.2 this month.
* In addition to general improvements and fixes, the headline feature of iOS 8.2 is official support for Apple’s wrist-worn device, which in all likelihood entails  a companion iPhone app for installing apps onto the Watch and managing various device settings.
* It’s interesting that BGR also mentions that an upcoming Apple event will serve as a launchpad for the Watch. The company is said to share more details about the device at the event, and “possibly” reveal next-generation MacBook laptops.
* Last week, the iPhone maker issued the iOS 8.1.3 software update containing fixes for a few nagging issues and addressing a major complaint concerning storage requirements to install future updates.
* And yesterday, the company seeded iOS 8 beta 5 (build 12A4345d) to developers with the usual mix of bug fixes coupled with a few expected user-facing tweaks and improvements, such as new Continuity SMS options, new Health privacy settings, spirometry data types in HealthKit, the ability to export data in the Health app and more.
