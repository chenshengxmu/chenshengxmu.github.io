* Apple has been praising the aerospace-grade glass of the new iPhone 4 since it was introduced. According to Cupertino, the new iPhone screen is “chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic”.
* Gdgt editor Ryan Block just posted this picture to his Twitter account. Seems that “30 times harder than plastic” is not scratch-resistant enough though. It looks like this Invisible Shield for iPhone 4 might be a good solution after all…
