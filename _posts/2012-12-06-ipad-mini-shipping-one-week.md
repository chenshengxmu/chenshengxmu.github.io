* Despite what some considered to be an outrageous price tag, demand for the iPad mini continues to outstrip supply. But the good news is, availability of the tablet is finally starting to improve.
* Hot on the heels of Apple’s announcement that the mini will be landing in China on December 14, shoppers have noticed that estimated shipping times on the slate have dropped to one week…
* As noted by AppleInsider, Apple’s web store is now showing ‘Available to ship’ times of one week for the iPad mini. This is the first time we’ve seen mini shipping estimates below 2 weeks since launch.
* As you can see in the above image, the 1 week ship date goes for all models, regardless of color or size. The pic was taken of the US store, but we’re seeing the same thing in Canada and other countries.
* Obviously, Apple has fixed whatever problem it’s been having in its supply chain, as iPhone 5 availability has also recently improved. Shipping times for the popular handset are now between 2-4 days.
* What’s iPad mini availability look like in your neck of the woods?
