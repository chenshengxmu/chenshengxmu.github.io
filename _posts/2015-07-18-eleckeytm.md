* How many times have you been out and about with friends or family when more than one person announces that they need to charge their iPhone while you are making a trip from one place to another? Probably a lot. I know it happens to me all of the time.
* The EleckeyTM car charger will help get you through those tough times with two smart USB ports so you can charge multiple devices at the same time. If you have two power outlet sockets in your car, you can grab an extra Eleckey for quad charging fun.
* This charging device is made from polycarbonate and brushed aluminum. It is slim and low-profile, so it won’t stick out too far past your car’s power socket. It has a blue LED light inside so you can easily see where the USB ports are, even in the dark. There is also an LED light ring around the charger, so even when both ports are being used, you’ll be able to see the device.
* The two smart USB ports identify your device and provide the appropriate amount of juice for up to 2.1 amps each. Charging stops automatically when your battery is full.
* The EleckeyTM comes in black with gray, white with gold, or white with silver. It is available on Amazon for $11. There is also an updated version of the Elekey that provides 3.1 amps and doubles as an emergency hammer because it is made from stainless steel. However, because of its weight, it is recommended to only be used in cars with an upward-facing power socket.
