* If you can’t stand the stock look of your stock Messages app, then maybe it’s time to put that jailbreak to good use.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called BetterMessages by harrywantstodev provides you with a number of new customization options for making your Messages app look unique when compared to everyone else’s.
* Once installed, you can head over to the Settings app where you will find a bevy of options:

* Among the things you can change here are:
* You must tap on the Apply Changes button at the bottom of the preferences pane every time you make changes. This will not respring your device, but it does overwrite your current settings, which is imperative if you want to see your settings come to life.
* Some of the options are more preferable than others, however many are difficult to showcase in screenshots. That said, I would recommend you try the tweak out for yourself to see what options do and don’t fit your personal needs.
* If you aren’t a fan of all the plug-ins and reaction effects that iOS 10 comes bundled with, or you want to make changes to the aesthetics of the of Messages app, then this tweak might have a number of features you could find useful.
* If you’re interested in giving it a spin, BetterMessages is available as a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and is intended to work on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
