* T-Mobile USA, the nation’s fourth-largest wireless company and the sole major U.S. carrier without the iPhone, today announced new unlimited “4G” data plan, as promised last month. The new plan will set you back $20 a month if you’re on T-Mobile’s Value plan or $30 a month for those on the Classic voice and text plan.
* The new plans do away with speed limits or bandwidth throttling, the carrier said. Though T-Mobile continues with its dubious practice of advertising its network and these new plans under the “4G” moniker, in the carrier’s terminology this really means iPhone-compatible high-speed 3G HSPA+ as T-Mobile is way overdue with 4G LTE deployment…
* According to a media release, a single line Value plan with unlimited talk and text combined with unlimited nationwide 4G data will cost $69.99 a month. Likewise, a single line Classic plan with unlimited talk, unlimited text and unlimited nationwide 4G data will cost $89.99 a month.
* Seventy bucks a month for unlimited everything, not bad.
* Existing customers on Classic or Value plans can simply upgrade their service by adding an Unlimited Nationwide 4G Data plan.
* T-Mobile appears to have joined carrier Sprint in offering unlimited data as both Verizon and AT&T have been recently pushing their new shared data plans.

* As for the iPhone, T-Mobile most likely won’t be getting Apple’s sought-after device this year. The carrier allegedly will install unlocked iPhone displays in stores, a part of its “Bring Your Own iPhone” campaign meant to encourage unlockers to try out 3G data on their iPhones and demonstrate its refarmed network.
* It was also reported yesterday that T-Mobile started distributing iPhone-friendly nano SIM kits to retailers in anticipation of the next iPhone launch on September 12.
