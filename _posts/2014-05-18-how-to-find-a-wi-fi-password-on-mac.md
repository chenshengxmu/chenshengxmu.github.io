* I was recently setting up my iPad mini, but could not remember the password for my home Wi-Fi network. After spending a few minutes trying to find it in Network Preferences on my MacBook Pro, I realized that I was looking in the wrong spot.
* Dating back several OS X versions, passwords have been stored in an application called Keychain Access. So if you’re looking for a password that you simply can’t remember, you’re in luck. Read ahead on how to find a Wi-Fi password on Mac… 
* Step 1: Type Keychain Access into Spotlight search () at the top-right menu bar.

* Step 2: In the sidebar, make sure you click on Passwords, then search for the network you want the password for and double click on it.

* Keychain Access also stores your applications, internet and web form passwords, so you’re in luck if you forget one of those too. If password management is something you are not great at, consider looking into 1Password on the Mac App Store. It’s a useful app for keeping track of passwords wherever you use them, especially in light of recent events like the Heartbleed bug.
