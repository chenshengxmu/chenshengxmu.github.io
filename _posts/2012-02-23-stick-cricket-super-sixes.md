title: Stick Cricket Super Sixes app review and giveaway
---
* One of the most famous online cricket games has been available for your iOS devices for a good few months now, and it’s fair to say I have a rather large addiction to the game.

* Unlike the original Stick Cricket – free in the App Store – where the aim was to slog bowlers out of the ground, Stick Cricket Super Sixes now makes you take on a machine, the Bowlomatic 3000, hell bent on wiping you out…
* The slogan for the game is ‘simple to play, difficult to master’ and it’s fair to say that assessment is spot on. There are two buttons: hit left, hit right. That’s the simple part sorted. It’s definitely one of the most frustratingly good games I’ve played in a long time as the various difficulty in levels can trip you up at any given time. And that’s where the difficult part comes in.
* The first levels are fairly easy to surpass but once you get to level 5, the Bowlomatic 3000 starts bringing some dirty tricks from up its sleeve. Watch out for a huge spotlight being shone into your eyes making visibility limited or the incredibly hard invisiball level.
* The HD graphics have been massively improved from the first outing. That along with the longevity of the game make it one of my all time favorite iOS games, which is good considering I’m not really the world’s biggest cricket fan.
* My top score so far is a whopping 855 runs and I have managed to get up to level 19. If you can beat this, I’d love to know about it. Screenshots please!
