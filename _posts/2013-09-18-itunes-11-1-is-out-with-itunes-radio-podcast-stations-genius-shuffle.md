* In another sign that iOS 7 release is imminent, Apple has just posted the iTunes 11.1 update which brings out not only iOS 7 compatibility, but a few new features, including the long-expected, ad-supported iTunes Radio streaming, in addition to Podcast Stations, the new Genius Shuffle capability, support for iOS 7 device sync and more.
* You’re going to love Genius Shuffle, “a magical new way to experience your music library” that plays songs that go great together from iCloud.
* And if you’re into podcasts, iTunes 11.1 lets you create automagically-updated custom stations of your favorite podcasts. I’ve included the full changelog right after the break…
* Here’s the full changelog.
* iTunes Radio – iTunes Radio is a great new way to discover music. Choose from over 250 stations or start a new one from your favorite artist or song. Enjoy iTunes Radio ad-free once you subscribe to iTunes Match.
* Genius Shuffle – Introducing a magical new way to experience your music library. Choose Genius Shuffle and iTunes instantly plays songs that go great together. Click it again to hear something new—enjoying your music has never been this easy.
* Podcast Stations – You can now create custom stations of your favorite podcasts that update automatically with new episodes. Your stations, subscriptions, and current play position sync over iCloud to the Podcasts app.
* Sync with iOS 7 – You can now use iTunes to sync your favorite music, movies, and more to devices with iOS 7. In addition, iTunes now makes it even easier to quickly organize and sync apps to your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
* You can download iTunes 11.1 for Mac and Windows PCs from Apple’s website.
* Alternatively, launch the Mac App Store or grab your update by firing up iTunes on your computer and choosing Check for Updates… from the iTunes menu.
* If the update isn’t live yet for you in iTunes or on Apple’s website, don’t panic – these things usually take time to propagate.
