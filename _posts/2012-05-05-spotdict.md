* Spotlight search is very useful when you actually need to use it, but how many times do you find yourself needing to do so?
* If you’re anything like me, you can probably count on one hand how many times you’ve used Spotlight over the past few months.
* Perhaps this recently released jailbreak tweak will coerce you into using Spotlight a bit more often? It’s called SpotDict, and it allows you to look up words in iOS’ built in dictionary directly from the Spotlight search page…
* SpotDict is a simple tweak with no options to configure. Once you install it, a small dictionary button is placed to the right of your Spotlight search bar.
* Typing a term in the search bar and tapping the dictionary button will invoke iOS’ built in dictionary tool. There you can learn the definitions of various terms, and still use the Spotlight search as it was originally intended to be used.
* It’s not the most exciting tweak on Cydia, but it can be a helpful tool when you need to quickly find the meaning of a particular word.
* Do you think you’d derive benefit from SpotDict?
