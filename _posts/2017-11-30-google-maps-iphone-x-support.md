* Google has finally begun updating its most important apps with support for the new iPhone X display resolution, starting with Google Maps, arguably its most widely-used mobile software.
* The mapping and navigation app now fills that beautiful edge-to-edge OLED display.
* It’s fully embraced the notch with maps rendered behind the current time, connectivity and battery information in both “ears” to the left and right of the TrueDepth camera.
* This is different than Apple Maps which blurs out content as it bleeds into each ear.
* The app also accounts for the notch in landscape, cleverly positioning buttons and other actionable user interface elements inward rather than at the outermost edges of the display.
* Aside from iPhone X support, Google Maps version 4.41 includes unspecified bug fixes.
* Google Maps for iOS is available free from App Store.
