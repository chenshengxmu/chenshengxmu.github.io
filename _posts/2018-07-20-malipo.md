* Whenever your iPhone connects to a power source to charge, whether via Lightning cable or Qi wireless charging, it plays a chime to let you know that the connection succeeded.
* Love it or hate it, Apple provides no way of customizing your iPhone’s stock charging chime. But a new free jailbreak tweak called Malipo by iOS developer iKilledAppl3 does.
* After you install Malipo, you’ll find a new preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you can:
* When you switch the charging chime, or change any of the tweak’s other settings, you’ll want to tap on the respring button at the bottom of the preference pane to save your changes.
* While the developer includes several chime alternatives out of the box, it’s worth noting that you could add more if you really wanted to. All the audio files used by the tweak are stored in /Library/Application Support/Malipo/CustomSounds, which you can access through a filesystem browser like Filza.
* After you set a custom chime and respring your handset, simply connect your iPhone to a power source to have a listen; it’s that easy.
* If you’re interested in giving Malipo a try for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Packix repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices.
* What will you be using as your iPhone’s new charging chime going forward? Share in the comments section below.
