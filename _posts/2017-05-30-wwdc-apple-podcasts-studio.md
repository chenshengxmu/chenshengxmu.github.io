* If you’re a podcaster attending Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week, Apple has a fully featured on-site studio that you can use to record the latest episode of your podcast.
* They’re calling it Apple Podcasts Studio and it’s located inside the McEnery Convention Center.
* Booking studio time is by appointment only. The available slots are limited to one per person for the duration of the conference.
* According to the description on the updated WWDC app, each hour-long recording session can accommodate up to four contributors, with Apple’s experts on hand to provide help if need be.
* Podcasters shall receive a copy of their session for post-production and distribution.
* “You may request a reservation beginning at 7am for that day only,” notes the firm.
* Tapping Request Reservation within the WWDC app takes you to the webpage at developer.apple.com/wwdc/consultations/ where you can reserve studio time:
* In April 2017, Apple rebranded its iTunes Podcasts app as Apple Podcasts.
* Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, said at the February 2017 Code Media conference that Apple’s been working on new features for podcasters. Last year, the Cupertino giant invited top podcasters to its headquarters to hear their complaints.
