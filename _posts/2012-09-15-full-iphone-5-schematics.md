* This is pretty interesting. It looks like Apple has posted up the full schematics for the iPhone 5 on its developer website. Even if you’re not a dev, you can find them in the Resources section.
* Essentially, these are the blueprints for Apple’s new smartphone. And they give accessory and case makers dimensions for everything from the ringer switch to the home button…
* From the diagram’s Note section:
* Apple also says not to block the top and bottom glass windows on the back panel with metal. There’s antennas behind them, which is why the back isn’t completely aluminum.
* The schematics won’t mean much to most folks, but they’re still cool nonetheless.
