* Apple today released the iOS 11.1 developer beta for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* While it doesn’t include the expected Apple Pay Cash, 3D Touch app switcher and Messages in iCloud features, you do get a few noteworthy perks in terms of the stock QuickType keyboard, updated system haptics on iPhones with Apple’s Taptic Engine, new animations and more.
* The stock keyboard now gives you multiple emoji suggestions, which is really nice.

* If you type something in the Messages app and switch to the Emoji keyboard, you’ll now see multiple emoji suggestions. This is similar to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro: you see the word that you wrote along with its suggestion and three emojis.
* Other tidbits include new heart rate design for finished workouts in the Activity app that’s consistent with the Health app, some cool new animations when you scrub to the top of the page or tap a notification banner while in an app, and more.
* iOS 11.1 will go through a few additional betas before releasing publicly.
* Let us know what you guys think of these new features down in the comments section.
