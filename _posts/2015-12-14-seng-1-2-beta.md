* Seng, the popular App Switcher and Control Center replacement created by developer Charlie Hewitt, is now available as a beta download for iOS 9. The beta is only available for users who have purchased the previous version of Seng, so that will unfortunately leave a lot of you out during the beta period.
* If you did purchase the previous version of Seng, however, it’s just a matter of adding Charlie’s beta repo to your list of Cydia sources to begin using the tweak on iOS 9.
* Seng is, for all intents and purposes, an Auxo alternative. Give the backlash that the recent release of Auxo 3 for iOS 9 has endured, it seems that Hewitt is striking while the iron is hot.
* In my hands on with Seng for iOS 8.4, I enjoyed what the tweak had to offer. It is very much an Auxo clone, but it’s a good one. If you’re not feeling the recent Auxo 3 update, then you should check out Seng. In my opinion, it’s more like Auxo 3 for iOS 8 than the most recent Auxo update for iOS 9.
* That’s not to say that Auxo 3 for iOS 9 is bad, it’s just a noticeable departure with the way the Multi-Center is now implemented on that tweak. Auxo’s developer had to make a judgement call as to how to work with iOS 9’s new App Switcher, which means that some will enjoy it and some won’t.
* If you previously purchased Seng, simply add Hewitt’s beta repo to your list of Cydia sources. His repo is as follows: http://chewitt.me/repo
