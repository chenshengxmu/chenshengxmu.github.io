* LG’s latest G6 flagship may have become the first non-Pixel phone to have Google’s new Assistant feature, but the search giant is focused on bringing its new personal assistant to as many other smartphones as humanly possible.
* Keeping true to its promise, the Mountain View firm just started rolling out Assistant to smartphones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow versions.
* With Assistant, you just long press on the Home button or say “Ok Google” to get started. The advanced feature leverages Google’s knowledge graph, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better understand context of your questions.
* Google’s conversational artificial intelligence helper debuted at Google I/O in March 2016 on its Pixel smartphones, the Amazon Echo-like Home speaker, in the cross-platform Allo messaging app and as a built-in feature of the latest version of the Android Wear platform.
* Assistant is rolling out to English-speaking owners of Android Nougat (6.0) and Android Marshmallow (7.0) in the United States, to be followed by English in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as German speakers in Germany.
* Google has said that the feature will automatically come to eligible Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services via a software update.
* They’ll continue to add more languages over the coming year.
