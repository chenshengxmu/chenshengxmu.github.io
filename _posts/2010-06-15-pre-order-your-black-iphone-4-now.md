* You can now pre-order your iPhone 4 now from Apple’s website, or you can reserve it for in-store pick up on June 24th.
* Hopefully you will have more luck than I did. I’ve been trying to pre-order a 32GB iPhone 4 for the last 30 minutes and I keep getting various error messages urging me to choose the in-store pickup option.
* The rumors about the white iPhone missing were spot on. Per Apple’s website, you will not be able to pre-order or get a white iPhone anytime soon. Why? I have no idea.
* Now go for it and let me know how your pre-order went.
