* We recently published an article showing you how to view the metadata of iPhone photos, including EXIF and GPS data. Being able to view the metadata of your iPhone photos is great, but being able to delete that metadata, and maybe more importantly deleting geolocation tags from these photos can actually be even more helpful.
* There are many reasons why you’d want to remove the metadata from your photos but the one that makes the most sense to me is that you’d want to remove GPS geotags to prevent anyone from tracking the exact location where the picture was taken.
* In this post, we will show you how to delete the metadata of your iPhone photos to effectively get rid of any data such as EXIF or geolocation. We’ll be using a free app called Koredoko. Other apps allow you to remove the GPS tags of iPhone photos but we’ll be using the one mentioned here…
* Before we get started, it must be noted that you can prevent your iPhone from automatically tagging your photos with your location in the first place by going into Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Camera > and make sure you choose “Never,” regarding when the Camera app can use your location. This being said, the rest of this post can apply to any photo (not only those taken with an iPhone).
* 1) Download Koredoko from the App Store. If for some reason, you do not want to use this app, we have a list of other apps that can help you delete geolocation data from your photos below.
* 2) Launch the application and allow it to access photos on your iPhone.
* 3) Tap on the List icon in the lower left corner of the screen to access photo library.

* 4) Search for the photo for which you want to remove the GPS data. Tap on the small blue “i” located to the right of the photo.

* 5) This will bring up the photo metadata, including its GPS data. Tap on the Share icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

* 6) Choose the “Share without Metadata” option from the menu you are presented with. You will then have the option to share the photo in several ways, including the ability to save the photo to your Camera roll. If that is the option you choose, the photo will then be saved to your camera roll, and will be stripped of any geolocation data.
* There are probably dozens of applications in the App Store that let you remove geotags from photos, but these are two that I tried myself and would recommend. They aren’t very pretty, but they work just as advertised.
