* Just hours after the Dev Team updated RedSn0w, young iPhone hacker iH8Sn0w updated his own jailbreak tool, Sn0wBreeze, to version 2.6. This new version of Sn0wBreeze uses i0n1c’s untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.2.
* For those of you that are not aware, Sn0wBreeze is a tool very similar to PwnageTool. Sn0wBreeze, a Windows-only jailbreak, allows you to update to the latest iOS while preserving your baseband, which is necessary if you want to unlock your iPhone.
* Sn0wBreeze 2.6 will work for any device that supports iOS 4.3.2, except for the iPad 2…
* Sn0wBreeze is a fairly easy jailbreak to use. If you need directions on how to use Sn0wBreeze, please refer to our latest Sn0wBreeze tutorial. The steps are identical.
* As usual, you can download Sn0wBreeze from our iPhone downloads section.
* If you decide to use Sn0wBreeze to jailbreak your iPhone, please let us know how it went by leaving a comment below.
