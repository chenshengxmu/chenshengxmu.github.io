* Wednesday, Apple announced a whole new collection of Spring-themed Apple Watch straps.
* The Cupertino company says its new Spring 2018 collection includes bands “for every occasion,” ranging from Woven Nylon bands with an updated stripe pattern that alternates white with color for a clean look to exclusive Nike bands color-matched to the latest Nike running shoes to a striking new edge paint color for Apple Watch Hermès bands.
* Here are the new bands for 38mm and 42mm models of Apple Watch:
* The latest Apple Watch Nike+ (GPS + Cellular) will now include Apple’s new 38mm and 42mm Space Gray Aluminum Case with Midnight Fog Nike Sport Loop models.

* This season’s Apple Watch Hermès bands feature an accent color, with the Single Tour Rallye and Double Tour bands now displaying contrasting paint details:
* All new bands will be available to order later this month from Apple.com and for purchase at select Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Resellers and carriers. Check out Apple’s press release for detailed pricing and availability information.
* Those latest striped Nylon bands sure look gorgeous. I wish I had a silver watch case (mine is in Space Gray) because I’d be getting a Nylon band for sure.
* How about you? Which new band is your favorite, and why?
