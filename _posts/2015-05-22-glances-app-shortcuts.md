* Glances are the quick information summaries of apps that are accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the watch face on your Apple Watch. In a previous post we told you all about glances, how to use configure them and how to use them.
* But there’s an additional thing that you should know about glances that is proving to be extremely useful for Apple Watch users. You see, a glance can be used as a direct shortcut to the app that it represents.
* In this post, which is a part of our larger Apple Watch guide, we’ll show you how to use glances as app shortcuts on your Apple Watch.

* Full Twitter Apple Watch app launched from its glance
* Step 1: Swipe up from the bottom of the watch face to open your glances
* Step 2: Swipe to the glance that represents the app that you wish to open
* Step 3: Tap on the glance to launch the full app
* Note that this works with all third-party app glances, and some of the first party glances as well. Obviously, if a glance has multiple parts, such as the Settings glance, or if it’s a special glance like the heart rate or power glance, that rule doesn’t apply.
* I find that using glances as app shortcuts is very helpful for my Apple Watch workflow. In fact, when it comes to some glances, I use them solely as app shortcuts, and ignore the information that they present.
* How do you use glances on your Apple Watch?
