* As we told you, the Pangu Jailbreak tool for iOS 9 was just released a few minutes ago. We’ve taken the liberty to test it out, and can vouch for its legitimacy as far as jailbreaking the iPhone goes. We tested it out with our iPhone 6s and were able to jailbreak and load Cydia successfully. In this post, we’ll show you how to do the same.
* Update: This guide was originally written for iOS 9, iOS 9.0.1, and iOS 9.0.2, but the Pangu Team has recently updated their tool making it possible to also jailbreak iOS 9.1. We suggest you read up about the iOS 9.1 jailbreak limitations first, then make sure you download the latest version of Pangu and follow these instructions to jailbreak your iOS 9.1 device (64-bit device only).
* Note: You must be running iOS 9. This tutorial is for Windows-only, since the Pangu tool is a Windows executable. You can run a Windows virtual machine on your Mac if you wish to jailbreak iOS 9 on a Mac. This jailbreak should work for any iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch capable of running iOS 9. That includes the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* Step 1: Backup your device and connect it to your computer via USB.
* Step 2: Disable Find My iPhone via Settings → iCloud → Find My iPhone.
* Step 3: Disable Passcode and Touch ID via Settings → Touch ID & Passcode.
* Step 4: Enable Airplane mode via Control Center.
* Step 5: Download the Pangu jailbreak tool for iOS 9 from our downloads page and run it.
* Step 6: Start the Pangu jailbreak by clicking the Start button and click Already Backup when prompted.
* Step 7: Your iPhone will reboot and Pangu will ask you to put your iPhone back into Airplane mode. Once you do this, it will continue the jailbreak.
* Step 8: After some time, the Pangu tool will request that you open the Pangu app on the iPhone’s Home screen.
* Step 9: Once the Pangu app is run, it will ask to you to allow access to your Photo Library. Tap the accept button on the Pangu screen to continue.
* Step 10: Tap the OK button on the “Pangu Would Like to Access Your Photos” pop-up box.
* Step 11: Your iPhone will reboot again. Once you reboot, disable Airplane mode, and run the Cydia app.
* Congratulations, your iPhone is jailbroken. What jailbreak tweaks will you install first?
* If you have trouble, be sure to watch our full video walkthrough posted above. In it, I show you step-by-step how to jailbreak the iPhone 6s using Pangu for iOS 9.
