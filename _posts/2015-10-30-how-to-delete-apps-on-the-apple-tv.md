* Along with rearranging apps in a similar manner to how it’s done on iOS, deleting apps on the Apple TV is a familiar exercise as well. Like iOS, there are two ways to delete apps from the Apple TV—from the Home screen and from the Settings app. Check out our video walkthrough that show you both methods in detail.
* Step 1: select the app that you wish to delete and click and hold the Touch surface to enter wiggle mode
* Step 2: press the Play/Pause button on your Apple TV remote
* Step 3: highlight the delete option, and click the Touch surface to confirm app deletion
* Step 1: open the Settings app
* Step 2: click General
* Step 3: click Manage Storage under the Usage heading
* Step 4: click the trash can icon next to the apps that you wish to delete
* Step 5: click Delete to confirm
* That’s all there is to it. Two simple ways to get rid of apps on the new Apple TV. The first way is the easiest, but the second way is by far the most efficient method if you wish to delete more than one app. Which way do you prefer?
