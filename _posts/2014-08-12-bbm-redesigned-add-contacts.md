* Today, BlackBerry pushed an update to its BBM for iPhone application (also known as BlackBerry Messenger) featuring an all-new contact-adding experience.
* In addition to the obligatory bug fixes and performance improvements, BBM version 2.3.0.12 makes it easier to add new contacts by PIN, email, SMS and barcode.
* Among other new features, the revamped software also permits you to search for BBM users, as well as review and accept invites from other people using the cross-platform messaging service…
* Back in June, BlackBerry redesigned BBM’s sign up and friending interface while adding new emoticons and improving experience for adding new contacts by email.
* BBM 2.3.0.12 changelog:
* Download BBM free in the App Store.
* The iPhone and iPod touch-only download needs iOS 6.0+ and comes in at 52.6MB.
