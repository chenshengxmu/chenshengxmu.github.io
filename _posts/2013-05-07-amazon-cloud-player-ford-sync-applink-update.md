* Not to be outdone by the popular Swedish streaming music startup Spotify, which a month ago updated its mobile client with support for Ford’s SYNC AppLink platform, the online retail giant Amazon today issued a similar update to its Cloud Player mobile app.
* The app integrates with AppLink vehicles so you can control music playback using your voice and the steering wheel buttons.
* Other changes new accessibility features via improved support for the iOS VoiceOver features and an “improved experience” when adding songs to a playlist…
* The AppLink platform, available on select Ford vehicles, allows for hands-free music playback control via such connected apps as Spotify and Amazon Cloud Player, by using voice commands and buttons on the steering wheel.
* In addition to streaming songs, albums and playlists from the Amazon cloud, the refreshed Cloud Player software lets you listen to music you already have on your smartphone or tablet.
* You can download Cloud Player free from the App Store.
* Amazon also has a handy iPad app which allows subscribers to Amazon’s $79 a year Prime service to stream or download movies and television shows from Amazon’s vast library of more than 120,000 videos.
