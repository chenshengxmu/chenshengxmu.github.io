* Microsoft today refreshed Bing for iPhone, adding more than half a dozen useful new features and enhancements, beginning with the Private Search Mode which will not remember your search history and sites you have visited.
* Other new features include better management of your search history settings, the ability to launch native iPhone applications right from the search results page, inline previews of clips in Video search and more.
* The new version of Bing features a vastly improved image search experience. You can now scroll or swipe up after you have tapped on an image in Image search to get useful information.
* The new image search is now overlaying the information previously showed below the image. Here’s a video overview of the new Image search experience.
* And after you scroll, Bing will show you (if available) the following:
* Try it out yourself by clicking on any image.
* Additional details on the new search experience can be found at the Bing blog.
* Moreover, Microsoft yesterday introduced new ways to search images faster, without typing, across Bing’s web app on iOS and Android devices in mobile browsers.

* Bing now supports the new emoji characters provided in iOS 8.3.
* “We were happy to see several new emojis in the iOS 8.3 update, since we made it possible for our users to search the web using emojis last year,” noted the Windows maker. “Now you can search using the newly added emojis as well as the old ones.”

* As mentioned before, it’s now possible to launch native iPhone applications right from Bing’s search results page, without having to leave the app. “You can now go beyond web search and find what you need in your favorite apps,” the team said.

* On the example screenshot above, Bing serves up the Open button allowing you to launch Amazon’s IMDb for iPhone app, if installed, when searching for movies. “This is just a beginning, and we’re excited to continue making it simpler for our users to navigate between web and apps with little friction,” said the firm.
