* Cupertino’s latest 4K-enabled Apple TV model has popped up on Amazon.com, suggesting that a tvOS version of the retailer’s Prime Video streaming app could be just around the corner.
* The listing for the 64 GB Apple TV 4K model surfaced recently on Amazon.com though the item was temporarily out of stock at the time of this writing. What’s important here is the fact that this is not some third-party offering, it’s actually Amazon selling the device.
* Apple said recently the tvOS Prime Video app would drop later this year, with one rumor alleging it could hit as soon as this Thursday alongside NFL’s Thursday Night Football games.
* Yesterday, Amazon slashed 4K content prices in the UK following the release of Apple TV 4K.
* iTunes Store now offers 4K content at HD prices ($20 per movie purchase). Apple has even cut deals with Hollywood major allowing it to upgrade customers’ previously-purchased HD movies to 4K at no additional cost, a first in the streaming industry.
* Thanks, Carlos!
