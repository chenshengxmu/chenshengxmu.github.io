* Well, well, well. Look what we found while perusing MuscleNerd’s Twitter account… This could be an indication that prodigy iPhone hacker Geohot might be doing yet another come back, this time with an untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1.
* This tweet was sent by MuscleNerd a couple of days ago in reply to someone telling him, Chpwn and others to stop all the drama. Now this could be MuscleNerd’s way of getting people off his back, or it could very well be the truth…
* At this point I don’t really know what to believe. It’d sure be nice to have an untethered jailbreak other than the painful RedSn0w right now. As usual, only time will tell.
* What do you think? Does Geohot have something up his sleeves? Is this all bs? Your guess is as good as mine. Make sure to share your thoughts in the comments section.
