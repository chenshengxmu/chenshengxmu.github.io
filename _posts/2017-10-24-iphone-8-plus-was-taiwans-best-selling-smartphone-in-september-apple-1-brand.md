* 64GB and 256GB editions of Apple’s iPhone 8 Plus filed as the best-selling smartphones in Taiwan in September, according to a new supply chain report.
* DigiTimes reported Tuesday that strong sales of the iPhone 8 series earned Apple a commanding lead with a 26.1 precent share of the local market in terms of sales volume.
* Apple also was first in terms of sales value, accounting for 52.7 percent of device sales value in the market, a sharp increase from 36.4 percent in August.
* This makes the Cupertino firm Taiwan’s top smartphone brand.
* Galaxy Note 8 was Taiwan’s best-selling Android smartphone in September, replacing the top-selling model in August—the R11 from Oppo.
* Sales of smartphones in the Taiwanese market totaled 587,000 units in September, down 0.3 percent from the previous month and 14.18 percent from a year earlier period.
* According to data compiled by local retail channels, Samsung Electronics ranked second with a 21.1 percent share in sales volume, followed by Asustek Computer (12.6 percent), Oppo (8.2 percent), Sony Mobile Communications (7.5 percent) and HTC (7.2 percent).
* Here’s a list of Taiwan’s top ten best-selling smartphones in September:
* In terms of sales value, Samsung came in second with a 21.7 percent share, up from 18.2 percent in the previous month, followed by Sony Mobile (6.1 percent), Oppo (5.5 percent), Asustek (5.2 percent) and HTC (four percent).
* Customers across Asia generally prefer larger-screened phones so that’s why the Plus variant of iPhone 8 rather than its 4.7-inch counterpart has proved so popular with buyers in Taiwan. Of course, iPhone 8 Plus also offers a dual-lens rear camera that can simulate professional studio lighting with Apple’s new Portrait Lighting shooting mode.
