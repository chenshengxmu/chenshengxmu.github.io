* The popular third-party Twitter client, Twitterrific, today added a host of new features following its recent Mac App Store relaunch, including two most popular feature requests: management for muffles and mutes, plus a setting for keeping timelines scrolled to the top.
* To quickly add usernames, keywords, phrases, hashtags and even whole domains to your list of items to be muffled in the timeline, choose Muffle Tweet from the three-dotted action menu, then select an item from the list to instantly minimize matching tweets.

* “Muffles stay out of the way and let you avoid spoilers or discussions about people or topics,” developers note. You can also click on a muffled tweet to peek at it (it re-collapses automatically when you scroll away).
* If you’ve ever wanted to muffle a word or phrase in the tweet, now you can—simply select that text in the body of the tweet before muffling and Twitterrific will present it as an option.

* You can now manage your muffles or convert them into full mutes from the Muffles panel in preferences, and even muffle tweets by client if you’d like to prevent posts from specific Twitter apps from appearing in your timeline.
* Remember to enable iCloud Drive on your Mac for muffles to sync across devices.
* When “Keep timeline pinned to top” is enabled in preferences, new tweets will automatically scroll into view when you’re at the very top of your timeline. To pause this automatic scrolling behavior, simply scroll the timeline away from the top tweet temporarily.
* Auto scrolling resumes as soon as you return to the top.
* Other tidbits in Twitterrific 5.1 include status indicators on the Dock and menu bar icons for new mentions and direct messages, marking a direct message as read or delete by right-clicking, lighter display fonts (System Light and Avenir Light) and more.
* Here’s everything new, fixed and improved in Twitterrific 5.1 for macOS:
* Muffle and Mutes:
* Automatic scrolling:
* Status indicators for new mentions or messages:
* ¡Demos la bienvenida al Diablo Azul!
* Today’s update is free to existing users of the app.
