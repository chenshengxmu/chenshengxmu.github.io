* Apple has updated its iWork for iCloud apps with a number of improvements today. The web versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote have each received new features with a focus on enhancing the user’s ability to collaborate with others on a document.
* All three apps have been updated to support collaboration with up to 100 people, edit larger documents of up to 1 GB, and support for images of up to 10MB. Additionally, they all now support chart formatting, and allow you to create 2D/interactive charts…

* Other changes include the ability to show and hide slide numbers in Keynote, and select alternating row colors in tables in Numbers. You can also now export Numbers and Pages documents to CSV and ePub, and Pages now offers more options for inline tables.
* In April, Apple updated all three iWork apps across all platforms with Retina support and other improvements. If you want to see today’s changes for yourself, simply visit iCloud.com on your computer or iOS device and sign in with your Apple ID (it’s free).
