* An image of another claimed spec sheet has surfaced on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo, indicating that the iPhone 7 could come with both a Lightning edition of Apple’s wired EarPods and a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box. As a result, the iPhone 7 should provide its owners with an appropriate solution for connecting their existing wired headphones to the handset right out of the box, without requiring them to purchase a standalone adapter.
* Before we get to it, let me just point out that the alleged spec sheet mentions “iPhone 7 Plus,” meaning Apple is likely to market the upcoming handsets under the existing naming scheme. And of course, the “256GB” label is in line with prior rumors that the next iPhone will double the maximum amount of storage from 128GB to 256GB.
* Here’s the image of that purported pamphlet.

* As you can see for yourself, the purported spec sheet indicates that the iPhone 7 box should contain the following items (aside from the handset itself and documentation):
* Anyone with adequate Photoshop skills can fake such pictures so we cannot say that today’s leak is proof that the 3.55mm-to-Lightning adapter will in fact be included in the iPhone 7 box, though we’ll be surprised if it’s not.
* For what it’s worth, The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEC) yesterday issued certificates for “AirPods”, suggesting Apple might also be planning to release wireless in-ear earphones standalone, as an optional accessory.
