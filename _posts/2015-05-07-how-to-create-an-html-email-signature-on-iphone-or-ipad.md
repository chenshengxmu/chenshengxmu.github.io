* One of our Twitter followers recently asked us if there was a way to use HTML signatures in the Mail app on iOS, so instead of replying to his tweet and giving him instructions, I thought it could benefit a larger audience if I posted the solution here. With that said, I’m going to show you how to create an HTML signature to be used in the Mail app on your iPhone or iPad.
* Step 1: The first thing you want to do is to launch your favorite mail app on your desktop, be it the Mail app on your Mac, or even Gmail in the browser. We will use that Mail app to create the HTML part of the signature.
* Step 2: In your favorite mail app on your computer, create a new email to be sent to yourself. In this email, just create the signature you want to use on your iPhone or iPad. The reason why this must be done from the desktop is because the stock Mail app on iOS doesn’t allow you to insert HTML code. The desktop app does.

* As you can see on the screenshot right above, the Mail app on OS X allowed me to insert a link over the name of my various social media accounts. This can be just as easily done in Gmail or any other mail app. Simply type in the word, and insert a link on it.
* Note that you could create that email signature from your iOS device, but as mentioned above, it doesn’t allow you to embed links on top of words. The only links that can be used in the Mail app on iOS are full links, such as iDownloadBlog.com, or http://www.twitter.com.
* Step 3: Once you’re done crafting the perfect email signature, just email it to yourself.
* Step 4: Open the email you just sent to yourself from your iPhone or your iPad, and copy the whole signature, as done on the screenshot below.

* Step 5: On your iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app and go to Mail > Signature.
* Step 6: Depending on your email preferences, you can choose to have the new email signature applied to all your accounts, or have a specific signature for each account. I personally like having one signature for my personal email, and one for my work email.
* Regardless of your preference, paste the HTML signature you copied in step 2 inside the Signature box. You will notice that the HTML code carries over.

* Step 7: You may now test your new HTML email signature by creating a new email. You will see the signature is automatically inserted at the bottom of the email.

* You may repeat the process for all your different emails. Note that you can also change the format by using bold, italic, and colors as well.
