* Along with seeding the fifth iOS 7 beta to its registered developers, Apple has also issued the fourth beta of the upcoming Apple TV 5.4 software update.
* The beta firmware files for the second and third-generation Apple TV model, as well as the tweaked third-gen model (Rev A), are now available to the registered members of Apple’s paid developer program through the iOS Dev Center…
* Release notes for the fourth Apple TV 5.4 beta reiterate “you can now use an iOS 7 device to set up an Apple TV after restoring or resetting all settings”.
* Other than that, I couldn’t find any other changes in the new build.
* You must install the software through iTunes, using a USB to micro-USB cable.
* Make sure to let us know about any noteworthy changes in the Apple TV 5.4 Beta 4 software down in the comments or via tips@idownloadblog.com and I’ll update the post accordingly.
* The previous beta, which was released on July 29, brought a number of under-the-hood improvements, including the ability to purchase iTunes music and another new feature allowing for easy set-top box setup after a full restore or reseting all settings using an iPhone or iPad.
* The latter feature is not supported on the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.
* The first beta of the Apple TV 5.4 software has introduced iTunes Radio, a new Conference Room Display mode, custom subtitles and more.
