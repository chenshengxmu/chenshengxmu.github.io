* Facebook today announced a new live-streaming feature on the mobile Messenger app, dubbed “Instant Video”. Similar to the live-streaming feature built into the mobile Facebook app, Instant Video allows you to start streaming live video with a friend on Messenger by tapping a new button found in chat windows. The video streams in a small window so that you can continue chatting while streaming.
* “We know that every message is unique and personal to you and the person you’re chatting with—so today, we’re excited to launch Instant Video, letting you to put a smile on the faces of those people who matter most in your life,” writes Facebook.

* To use Instant Video, both you and your friend must be viewing an open Messenger conversation. Then, tap a new video icon in the top right corner to start sharing real-time video. Audio is off by default, but you can turn it on at any time. Your friend can watch your video stream and share a video back if they decide.
* A reflection of the ubiquity of video, Instant Video should come in handy for those times you wish to show something to a Messenger friend, share quick moments with them and watch their reactions and what not.
