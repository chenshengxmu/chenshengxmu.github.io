* Looking for a way to enhance your SMS experience, but apps and tweaks like biteSMS or SMSPlus fail to meet your needs? If so, perhaps it’s time to go beyond SMS.
* Indeed, BeyondSMS is a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone that integrates tightly with the stock SMS app, providing things like hidden message capability and live camera wallpaper. Take a look inside for a full video synopsis…
* BeyondSMS provides a healthy dose of features that you simply won’t find using Apple’s bland SMS implementation.
* Along with the items previously mentioned, there’s support for text to Emoji translation, conversation locking and hiding, along with text bubble opacity adjustments.

* You’re obviously not going to find a biteSMS replacement here, or even something that rivals SMSPlus in terms of the sheer number of features. What you will find, are a few nifty features tucked neatly into Apple’s stock application.
* Even better, for a limited time, jailbreakers can download a copy of BeyondSMS on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99.
* Considering its features, would you consider giving BeyondSMS a spin?
