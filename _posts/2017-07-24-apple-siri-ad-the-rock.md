* Apple last evening uploaded on its YouTube channel arguably the best advertisement for Siri yet.
* Featuring Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock and running three minutes and 45 seconds long, the polished commercial is amusing and depicts Johnson using Siri to help him get through his typically action-packed day.
* And here it is.
* “You should never, ever, under any circumstances, underestimate how much Dwayne Johnson can get done in a day with Siri,” reads the video’s description. The closing line invites you to “follow the world’s busiest actor and Siri as they dominate the day” via a special webpage on Apple’s website.
* How do you like this ad?
