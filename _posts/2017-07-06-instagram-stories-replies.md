* Instagram today announced that users of its popular photo-sharing service can now reply to Stories from people they follow with photos and videos. “From selfies to Boomerangs, now you can be even more fun and playful when you respond to friends,” said the company.
* The new feature requires Instagram version 10.28 for iOS.
* To reply to a Story with a photo or a video, hit the new camera button that appears while you’re watching a Story. If you don’t see the icon, the feature has not launched yet in your country.
* Like with regular posts, you can pretty up your reply using Instagram’s creative tools, allowing you to use face filters, stickers and the Rewind feature. “Replies also include a sticker of the Story that you can move around and resize,” said Instagram.
* You’ll get a message via Direct when someone replies to your Story with a photo or a video.

* You can tap the message to view the reply and also see a sticker of the original story that’s only visible to you. As with disappearing media in Direct, your friends will know when you’ve taken a screenshot (Android only) or replayed a reply.
* To learn more about these new features, be sure to check out Instagram’s Help Center.
* Instagram for iPhone and iPad is available free from App Store.
