* Apple is in talks with the National Football League regarding streaming rights, reports Reuters. Citing two sources familiar with the situation, the outlet says the iPhone-maker is among a group of tech firms pursuing the opportunity to live-stream 3 NFL games next season.
* More specifically, the companies are looking to buy the rights to conduct live streams for all three of the NFL games to be played in London next year. Yahoo hosted a live stream of a single London-based game this season, and by most accounts it was a success for both parties.
* It’s unclear if the NFL seeks to sell the rights to all 3 games next season as a package, or individually, or how much it’s asking for the exclusive. The League has also put Thursday night game broadcasts up for bid, but CBS has held them for the past 2 years and is expected to again.
* The three games scheduled to be played in London are the Colts vs. the Jaguars on October 2, Giants-Rams on October 23, and the Redskins-Bengals on October 30. Google is also involved in the bidding, and if it or Apple wins the rights, it would be a first for either company.
