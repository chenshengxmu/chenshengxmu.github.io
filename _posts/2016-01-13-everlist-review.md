* List, lists, lists. I’ve got lists coming out of my ears, at least metaphorically, since my lists are all on digital formats. My point is that I make a lot of lists. I don’t think I could get anything done if I didn’t have them. I’m always looking for ways to make my lists easier to understand and faster to access.
* Everlist is about as close as you can get to making a list with pen and paper. However, it looks much better than a crumpled old note pad and does things that paper just can’t do. We’ve got an app review of Everlist for your reading pleasure right now.
* When it comes to making and keeping track of lists, some people just give up on apps and stick with the simpler action of writing stuff down. I used to be the same way until I learned just how useful (and cleaner) digital lists could be. This app turns list making into the easiest part of your day by making the process simple and with only the minimum of bells and whistles so you don’t feel bogged down by features.
* All of your lists are kept on one screen and displayed in box like folders. Each one has a nice looking picture across the header to remind you to relax. Tap on a chore folder to access the list.
* Each item on your list has an icon next to it. If there is a specific icon available that matches a word in your list, it will appear. For example, if you add “ride the bike for 30 minutes” to your list, a bicycle icon will appear. However, if you add “Review App,” a simple arrow (the default icon) will appear instead.

* To create a new list, tap the menu icon in the upper left corner of the screen and select “Edit Folders.” Then tap the plus button at the bottom of the screen to name it. Name your folders like you would different lists. For example, Chores, Weekend Projects, Groceries, etc.
* Start writing your list out like you would on a piece of paper. Tap the plus button at the bottom of the screen and enter the item. You can add a due date or move the item to a different folder. You can also trigger a repeat function and set reminders. Then, tap OK.
* Once you’ve created all of the lists you need to stay organized, you can check items off by swiping to the right, or taping on the check box. Tapping the check box keeps the item on the list, but with that satisfying slash mark across it. Swiping to the right removes the item entirely.
* If you set a deadline for a task, but didn’t get it done, or know you won’t get it done in time, you can reschedule the due date. Swipe the item to the left and move it to tomorrow, next week, or customize the date.
* You can view your tasks by list folder, or by what is due today or due tomorrow. You can also get an overview of all tasks that are due on all of your lists, displayed in chronological order.

* The point of this app is to make it really easy to create and manage task lists. It does the job really well. I also appreciate the relaxing images instead of the typical brightly colored bars and banners that a lot of newer list managing apps are designed with.
* If I were to complain about anything it would be the lack of features, which I know is what makes this app so good. However, I’d love to be able to add subtasks and set the time I receive notifications.
* Everlist is free and does not have in-app advertising. There is nothing priced better than zero dollars. The app works great for people wanting the easiest way to make a list without using a pen and paper.
* If you find yourself giving up on digital list apps and resorting back to pen and paper, I highly recommend trying Everlist. It is very easy to use and has a simple design. Plus, you won’t accidentally leave it behind when you head out to the grocery store. Download it in the App Store today.
