* After we posted that i0n1c was going to wait until 4.3.1 to release his jailbreak, it seemed as though early iOS 4.3 adopters were left without many options. That situation changed yesterday when Sn0wbreeze 2.3 Beta was released into the wild.
* iPhone hacker, iH8sn0w, decided to give Windows users a jailbreak solution for Apple’s latest 4.3 software. It is important to note that Sn0wbreeze is only available on the Windows platform, and that it is a tethered jailbreak. That means that every time you reboot your iDevice, it needs to be connected to your computer to rerun the jailbreak software…

* For those of you who already upgraded to 4.3 and have a PC, this seems to be your best and only option. If this release gives you the courage to upgrade to 4.3, please understand the dangers of doing so. Also make sure you save your SHSH blobs with either TinyUmbrella, or something similar, in case you need to downgrade for any reason.
* It’s important to mention that the jailbreak is not for the iPad 2, and is still in beta mode. But if you meet the criteria and are the adventurous type (or have no other options), Sn0wbreeze 2.3 Beta can be downloaded here.
* Has anyone upgraded to 4.3 and tried this out? Tell us about it below!
