* It seems like rumors involving Apple’s secret TV project are getting debunked almost as fast as they are surfacing these days.
* Just yesterday we found out that the Cupertino company is not involved in talks to purchase Loewe, a German TV manufacturer. And now Foxconn has deflated a rumor that its CEO confirmed the existence of an Apple TV set…
* In response to recent claims that Foxconn head CEO Terry Gou indicated that it was getting ready to start making Apple-branded TV sets, the Taiwanese manufacturer provided TheNextWeb with the following statement:
* “Gou neither [confirmed] nor [speculated] about Foxconn’s involvement in the production of any product. It’s company policy not to comment on any customers or their products.
* Foxconn is always prepared to meet the manufacturing needs of customers should they determine that they wish to work with Foxconn in the production of any of their products.
* Any reports that Foxconn confirmed that it is preparing to produce a specific product for any customer are not accurate.”
* While the statement doesn’t necessarily prove that Foxconn isn’t working on an Apple TV, it does remove Gou’s comments as evidence — something the ‘iTV’ theory has been lacking since its inception. There is literally 0 proof that such a product exists.
