* Seven of Samsung Display’s sixth-generation manufacturing plants will increase production capacity of OLEDs destined for iPhone 8 by sevenfold from 15,000 panels per month from last year to 105,000 panels per month this year.
* According to a report Friday by ETNews, Samsung Display executives earlier this month finished inspecting the seven production lines that churn out OLED panels for iPhone 8.
* The plants are going to operate on full scale, indicating iPhone 8 may arrive on time and that potential customers should be able to get their hands on the device when it launches.
* A single OLED panel contains enough material to cut several iPhone 8-sized screens. At 105,000 panels per month, the South Korean conglomerate could theoretically produce a total of 130 million units of 5.8-inch OLED screens for iPhone 8 per annum.

* This is Samsung Display’s sixth-generation manufacturing plant, dubbed “A3”, solely dedicated to producing energy-efficient OLED panels for iPhone 8.
* That number is on the high side and assumes a yield rate of 100 percent, which is impossible to achieve. As OLED panels are still challenging to produce in volume, the actual yield on Samsung-made OLEDs for iPhone 8 should hover at or slightly above the 60 percent mark.
* In comparison, Samsung Display’s production yield rate on OLED panels for Samsung Electronics’ devices like the latest Galaxy S8 is about 80 percent.
* At an operation rate of 100 percent and a 60 percent yield, Samsung should be able to produce about 75 million six-inch OLEDs and 79 million 5.8-inch units for iPhone 8, respectively.
* The South Korean conglomerate is also investing big money in converting its existing LCD factories into OLED-making plants to help it fulfill Apple orders.
