* Apple’s been experimenting with installment payments in emerging markets for some time now. For example, installment payments coupled with increased marketing helped quadruple Apple’s single-digit iPhone market share in India. And in China, the online Apple Store offers 1, 3, 6 and 12 payment installment options with no interest, thanks to Apple’s partnership with China Merchants Bank.
* That being said, in what appears to be another effort to improve its standing in the US market, Apple has reportedly partnered with Barclay’s to offer a no-interest option on T-Mobile iPhone 5 sales at Apple Stores…
* Terms of purchase are said to be the same as on T-Mobile, which will sell the iPhone 5 beginning April 12 for $99 down plus $20 per month over the next 24 months. By doing so, the new financing option on T-Mobile iPhone 5 sales at Apple Stores seemingly matches T-Mobile’s deal in terms of cost of ownership, as both hardware costs equal the same $579.
* 9to5Mac has more:
* We’ve learned that Apple has partnered up with Barclays and T-Mobile to offer 24 months no interest when buying a new iPhone on T-Mobile at Apple Stores.
* Barclays will also be crediting customers’ accounts $70, allowing Apple Store customers to finance the T-Mobile iPhone for the same $579 price point as T-Mobile offers through its 24 month plan.
* Other carriers will be no doubt watching closely T-Mobile’s new “Un-carrier” policy.
* Thus far, neither AT&T nor Verizon indicated changes in their respective offerings.
* AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson kind of likes that idea and said his company is ”going to be watching” how installment payments work out for T-Mobile.
* Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam was less enthusiastic: while acknowledging that T-Mobile’s new strategy is “very intriguing,” he wonders if consumers are ready to pay full price.
* At any rate, the ability to spread the cost of hardware across 24 monthly payments without having to commit your soul to a carrier is bound to get more and more popular and I expect other major U.S. telcos to follow suit sooner than later.
* It’s also intriguing that a T-Mobile iPhone 5 is actually cheaper that its $649 unlocked no-contract counterpart sold by the online and brick-and-mortar Apple Stores, Walmart.com and other places, as depicted on the screenie top of post.
