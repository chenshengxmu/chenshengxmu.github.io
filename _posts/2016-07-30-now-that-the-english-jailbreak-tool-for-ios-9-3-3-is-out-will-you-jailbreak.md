* The jailbreak for iOS 9.2-9.3.3 has been out since last weekend, but it wasn’t until Friday that Pangu got to launching an English version of the once Chinese-only jailbreak tool.
* As we know many of you were holding out for an English jailbreak and for a few updates to the tool for stability, we’re curious about whether or not you’ll be making the jump now that the English tool is out.
* The jailbreak tool that was in Chinese worked just as well as the one that’s in English today, but since Cydia would be installed with a tool that you couldn’t even read, it intimidated a lot of people.
* Now that you can jailbreak your device with a method that is purely English, you don’t have to worry about not understanding the jailbreak process.
* With the new jailbreak process released on Pangu on Friday, all you do is open Cydia Impactor on your Mac, Windows PC, or Linux box and side-load a special IPA file onto your device. This IPA file installs the Pangu jailbreak app, allowing you to jailbreak your device and install Cydia.
* The process is a little different than that of the Chinese jailbreak tool that was launched on Windows over the weekend, but it still gets the job done. We have a complete tutorial on how to jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 with the English version of Pangu, which will help guide you through the process if you’re still intimidated.
* For the most part, stability is the only thing still holding people back from jailbreaking iOS 9.3.3 apart from the language.
* As far as stability goes, the jailbreak runs very smoothly, and it doesn’t impact the device’s performance.
* There are only two problems that we face in this jailbreak, and those are: 1) it’s semi-untethered, which means you have to run the jailbreak app on the device every time you reboot your device, and 2) you need to re-sign the IPA every time your certificate expires which can range from 7 days for free Apple ID users to 1 year for subscribed Apple developers.
* The semi-untether process isn’t difficult at all; all you have to do be re-load the jailbreak app every time you reboot your device All of your jailbreak tweaks will stay on your device and your device will still be jailbroken after the process. All of your jailbreak teaks and extensions will remain on your device even after your certificate expires and you renew it.
* No, it’s not as fluent as an untethered jailbreak, but honestly, you can’t expect the best of the best all the time. That would be a very spoiled way of thinking. The jailbreak developers have worked hard to produce what they have, and this is what we have to work with right now. For all we know, they’re saving their untether exploits for iOS 10.
* Not to mention, there was once a time when tethered jailbreaks, which actually required connecting your devices to a computer to reboot, were a real thing, and many people jailbroke despite the burn-backs.
* As far as the re-signing goes, it really only takes 10 minutes of your time every week to do this. If you were lucky enough to get the enterprise certificate before Apple revoked it, then you won’t even have to waste any of your time for an entire year. How great is that?
* With that being said, will you be jailbreaking iOS 9.3.3 now that an English tool is out to make things a little easier?
* Despite all the confusion surrounding the jailbreak, we hope to clear up a lot of the confusion in the posts we make at iDB, so we highly recommend staying tuned and reading all of our tutorials and pieces about the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak so you can get a level-headed understanding of what’s involved and how it works.
