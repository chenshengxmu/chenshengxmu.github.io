* When Samsung introduced its third-generation Galaxy S smartphone earlier this month, folks immediately took to Twitter, opining how the handset was “designed by lawyers” in a nod at Samsung’s ongoing legal feud with Apple over alleged copying of the iPhone’s hardware design and software features.
* Instead, the phone that was “inspired by nature” and “designed for humans”, as the tagline has it, fits in Samsung’s five-year redesign plan and went through hundreds of iterations before they settled on a final design….
* The Verge points us to an iNews24 report based on a chat with Samsung design VP Chang Dong-hoon at the 2012 Seoul Digital Forum.
* No, he argued, the Galaxy S III wasn’t designed by lawyers, as the popular meme has it.
* Fielding questions from reporters, the designer said:
* Our change in smartphone design is part of a five-year plan, not a sudden turn-around.
* Backing up the claim, he pointed out the handset’s smooth overall curvature and, specifically, the curved shape as a proof that the design team conceived a uniquely-shaped product that has nothing to do with the look and feel of Apple’s iPhone.
* Oh, he also said that Samsung has emerged as a market leader in design.
* Back in March, Chang Dong-hoon told Reuters that for Samsung’s design team, Apple’s allegations are personal.
* Samsung’s flagship Galaxy smartphone lineup is “original from the beginning”, he told the news gathering organization, adding:
* As a designer, there’s an issue of dignity. The Galaxy is original from the beginning, and I’m the one who made it. It’s a totally different product with a different design language and different technology infused.
* To be completely honest, there are only that many ways one can design a smartphone and just because Samsung’s new darling has a shiny bezel doesn’t mean they ripped off the iPhone.
* I owned a Galaxy S II (and now have both an iPhone 4S and a Galaxy Nexus).
* In my opinion, the Galaxy S II indeed bears more than a few passing resemblances to Apple’s phone.
* But the Galaxy S III looks different and I guess you could stay it stands out on its own as a distinctively designed smartphone.
* On a final note, the designer is partially right: Samsung has vastly improved the look and feel of its high-end consumer electronics products (Smart TVs need some work, though).
* Personally, I wouldn’t go as far as to call them “a market leader in design”, but they are in fact ahead of most gadget makers in the design department.
* I guess you thought I’d never say that, huh?
* Credit goes where credit is due, folks.
