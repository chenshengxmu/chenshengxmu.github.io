* Some tasks are easy to complete on your own, like washing dishes or feeding the cat. Others are harder and sometimes you need extra help to stick to them, like quitting smoking or exercising everyday. One way to stay on track is to ask your friends and family to hold you accountable to your goals.
* CommitTo3 is a goal creation app that lets you work with teams to complete tasks. Whether it is a group-oriented project, or a personal goal that you need help staying committed to, you can gather your posse and get started.
* You must sign up with a new account in order to use this app. The service is based on sending email notifications when task (or “Commits” as they are called here) are created and completed. That is the only reason your email address is used.

* The idea behind the “Commit to three” program is that people get more done if they only commit to three goals or projects per day, especially if they are written down and then shared with friends and family.
* Once you’ve logged in, you can create an accountability team based on such groups as co-workers, band mates, and family. Then, name each team (for example, my band mates and I could share a Commit under our name, while my family and I could share one under “Chores.”
* Every morning, you start off with three Commits, like “take a 20 minute walk” or “eat vegetables for lunch.” The more precise the goal, the easier it is to know how to accomplish it. Check off each Commit after you complete it. You can watch your team members’ progress as well. When you see that your dieting buddy has just completed all three goals, you might be more likely to get off the couch in order to keep up with him.
* You can also share your Commits on Facebook if you are looking for public accountability. When you complete all three Commits, your progress will post automatically to Facebook, as well.

* The app also features a Notification Center extension, so you can view and check off your three Commits, right from your lock screen.
* Keep in mind that this is not a daily to-do list maker. You can’t push Commits off until tomorrow. It works best with groups of people. You can only add three Commits per day. Instead of trying to fumble through dozens of little tasks, this app asks you to commit to three of your most important goals every day, and then helps you stay accountable by telling your friends and family about it.
* CommitTo3 is available to download for free. When you sign up, you will be able to access the program for free for seven days. After the trial period is over, a yearly subscription costs only $2.99. Download it in the App Store today.
