* Earlier today, Apple unveiled a new iPhoto application for iOS during its iPad 3 event. The app is essentially a mobile version of its popular photo editing and management software for the Mac.
* While we’ve already outlined most of iPhoto’s components, a new discovery has been made regarding one of its features. It appears that the app doesn’t use Google Maps for any of its GPS-related tasks…
* As noted by 9to5Mac, iPhoto uses a new mapping service in place of Google’s for its geotagging feature. And since the service isn’t accredited to anyone, it’s almost certainly coming directly from Apple.
* Why is this so significant? Well, Apple has purchased a handful of mapping companies over the past few years, including Placebase and C3 technologies. But we have yet to see their work integrated into any of Apple’s products.
* This could be the company’s first big step in separating itself from Google. As most of you know, there is growing tension between the two tech giants due to a mixture of competition and lawsuits involving Google’s Android OS.
* This may not look like much at the moment, but it could very well be the start of something major.
