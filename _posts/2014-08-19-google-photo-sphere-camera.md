* Google has released a brand new iPhone photography application in the App Store. Dubbed Photo Sphere Camera, it provides functionality similar to the iOS Panorama shooting mode, and then some more.
* By continuously taking images as you pan your device around, Photo Sphere Camera then stitches the individual photos together to create a nice sphere-like 360-degree image which can be published directly to Google Maps or shared with anyone on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and via email.
* The app is a free download. I’ve included additional tidbits right after the jump…
* The app couldn’t be simpler.
* After tapping the shutter button, a series of blue on-screen dots will appear acting as a virtual representation of your surroundings. Now picture yourself standing inside a huge globe and simply pan the device around until you’ve captured each and every one of these dots.
* The app will stitch the individual images together, creating a single 360-degree view that can be swiped and panned around with your finger (it’s a lot like Street View in Google Maps), geotagged and published to Google Maps or Google’s Views service, shared with others on social media and more.
* To be perfectly clear, photo sphere functionality has been built into Android’s native camera app for the past year.
* From Google’s release notes:
* Create beautiful 360º images and publish them on Google Maps. Photo spheres empower you to look up, down and all around to revisit the amazing places you’ve encountered — and share them with anyone.
* The following how-to video explains how Google’s app can be used to take a series of photos and automatically turn them into a seamless 360-degree panorama that can be published to Google Maps.
* iPhones since iOS 6 have had support for taking high-quality panoramic images with the stock Camera app.
* Check out two more app screenshots below.

* Key features include:
* To learn more, head over to Google’s official Photo Sphere microsite.
* Download Photo Sphere Camera free in the App Store.
* The 18.7-megabyte download requires any iPhone from the iPhone 4s onward and iOS 7.0 or later. The iPhone 4 can’t create photo spheres, cautious the search giant.
