* I can’t even keep count of how many times I’ve landed on a non-English web page and needed to use Google Translate to understand what I was looking at. But it now seems that there’s a more straightforward way.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called iTranslate by iOS developer Teun Strik builds a translation feature directly into the Safari web browser itself, allowing you to translate words, sentences, or entire web pages in what feels like an instant.  
* As depicted in the screenshot examples above, iTranslate adds a new “Translate” option to the copy/paste menu that pops up whenever you highlight text on a web page.
* When you tap on the Translate button, iTranslate promptly launches a new Safari tab and begins loading a Google Translate page along with any text you highlighted. From there, you can see the full translation to your native language.
* Upon tinkering with iTranslate myself, I find the tweak and its implementation to be astonishingly convenient. It takes nearly no effort at all to highlight some curious text on a web page and translate it into a language that I understand.
* Anyone who thinks that instant web page translation would be useful may want to give iTranslate a change. The tweak can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and doesn’t come with any options to configure; more importantly, it only works with jailbroken iOS 10 devices and in the stock Safari web browser.
* Will you be installing iTranslate on your jailbroken iPhone or iPad? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
