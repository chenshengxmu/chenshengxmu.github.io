* With today’s release of iOS 6 and OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2, Apple has updated its Podcasts app with support for iCloud subscription syncing. Just a few minutes later, updates to Apple’s other apps went live in iTunes, including iLife and iWork apps and utils like Find My Friends, Remote, AirPort Utility and more. With so many third-party apps being updated for iOS 6 support as we speak, you may want to prioritize your downloads. Here’s what’s new in Apple’s own updated apps for your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad…
* iBooks version 2.1.1 (free doownload) is a maintenance update weighing in at 42.4MB and addressing an issue which prompted you to sign in with your Apple ID at unexpected times. Apple urges people who experienced this issue to open iBooks after updating.
* Find My Friends version 2.0 (free download) now features location-based alerts, a feature requiring iOS 6 and allowing, say, parents to receive alerts when their kids leave school or when a family member arrives home safely. You can also take advantage of this feature to have Find My Friends notify others about your location. Find My Friends 2.0 also brings friend suggestions and favorites and weighs in at 18MB.
* Find My iPhone versions 2.0 (free download) weighs in at 13.9MB. The program adds the battery charge indicator and lets you (finally!) login forever. On iOS 6, if the account used to log in is the same as the iCloud account configured on the device and the device has passcode enabled on it.
* Last, but not the least, the app has a new feature called Lost Mode, pictured below.

* Available on devices running iOS 6 or later, Lost Mode locks a missing device with a four-digit passcode and can display a contact phone number right on the lock screen. The interesting bit: while in Lost Mode, your device will keep track of where it has been and display its recent location history when you check in with the Find My iPhone app..
* iTunes Movie Trailers 1.2 (free download) weighs in at 3.7MB, adds support for iOS 6.
* iTunes U version 1.3 (free download) weighs in at 18.3MB and adds support for iOS 6, also enabling a new single day view to see all of your posts and assignments due on a particular day and addresses an issue which prevented Closed Captioning from appearing when available.
* iAd Gallery version 1.2 (free download ) is a 1.7MB compatibility update which brings the program up-to-date on iOS 6-enabled devices.
* AirPort Utility version 1.1 (free download) is 4.3MB and adds support for iOS 6.

* Keynote version 1.6.2 ($9.99 download) weighs in at 286MB, it supports iOS 6 and brings out an interesting new ability to open a presentation in another app.
* Pages version 1.6.2 ($9.99 download), just like new versions of Numbers and Keynote, brings iOS 6 support and the ability to open a document in another app. The updated versions is a 231MB download.
* Numbers version 1.6.2 ($9.99 download) weighs in at 255MB. The program supports iOS 6 and can open a spreadsheet in another app.

In addition to supporting iOS 6, this new version lets you create custom ringtones and alerts for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch (requires iOS 6 or later) and import songs from the Music library on your device, play or record with GarageBand in the background while using other apps (requires iPhone 4S, iPad 2 or later).
* iPhoto version 1.4 ($4.99 download) is a 144MB update bringing support for iPod touch, Shared Photo Streams in iOS 6 (Aperture, too), the ability to work with up to 36.5-megapixel images and import full-rez photos via iTunes File Sharing, six new ink effects such as Chalk and Palette Knife, bulk exports, video uploads to Facebook, location and friend tags when sharing images on Facebook and a whole bunch more.
