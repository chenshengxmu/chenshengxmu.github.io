* Transparency is one of those tweaks that allows you to do all sorts of things with respect to the look of your Home screen app icons. As its name suggests, the primary purpose is to make your icons transparent, or in many cases outright invisible.
* Once installed, you’ll receive a new settings panel in the Settings app that allows you to customize your app icons in a very granular way. Take a look at our video walkthrough for the detailed evidence…
* Again, this tweak is far from groundbreaking, but from my experience it is solid. Sure there may be other options out there to accomplish similar results, but the fact of the matter is that Transparency is free, and focused solely on the task at hand.
* For those reasons, you might consider heading over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo and taking it for a test drive.
* Do you plan on trying Transparency?
