* Yes! I was just talking about this in my Samsung Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 5s post, and it’s actually here. As I type this with tears on my keyboard, it’s almost hard to believe that Apple has opened up its SDK with the ability to use third party keyboards.
* This means that you will be able to use third party keyboards like Swype for faster more sensible input for touch screens…

* As in typical Apple fashion, Apple has placed security as a top priority for third party keyboards. For example, keyboards are presented with a warning on the potential repercussions from using them.
* I’m super excited about finally being able to legitimately use Swype on iOS 8. It just makes so much more sense to use gestures on touch screen instead of hunting and pecking like you would with a standard desktop keyboard. What about you?
