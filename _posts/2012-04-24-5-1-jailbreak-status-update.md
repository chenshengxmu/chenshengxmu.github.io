* We’ve had a lot of folks asking us what the status is on the iOS 5.1 jailbreak, so we figured we’d give you guys an update with the latest info. As usual, pod2g has given us some insight into the progress of the hackers via a recent string of tweets.
* The good news is that they have managed to bypass the ASLR (Address Space layout randomization) already. The complicated security measure could’ve taken much longer. The bad news is that a public jailbreak still seems to be a ways out…
* “ETA for 5.1 JB : no clue! We’re going to set pieces of the puzzle together this week. We could have issues… Could be 1 month maybe 2… Maybe never… (!)
* I know 1 month seems long, but it’s short to work on a project like this when it’s a hobby and you’ve other things to do as well.”
* It’s important to remember that most of these guys do have normal day jobs, or at least other projects that they are working on. Releasing free jailbreaks doesn’t exactly pay the bills.
* Also keep in mind that it’s not a good idea to complain about the jailbreak’s progress to pod2g, or any other hackers, on Twitter. All that does is make the jailbreak community look bad.
* Besides, they do a pretty good job of keeping us updated on the latest developments. And of course, you can always count on us to bring you the latest in jailbreak information the moment we get it.
