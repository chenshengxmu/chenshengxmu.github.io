* The Apple Watch Nike+ is available as of yesterday and our resident video editor Andrew O’Hara just published a video showing off its design and features. As we mentioned many times before, the Apple Watch Nike+ is literally the Apple Watch Series 2 with some exclusive features.
* Now, exclusivity comes in the form of unique Nike-inspired bands and Nike-themed watch faces and complications that are not available on regular Series 2 devices. Here’s our hands-on with the watch faces and complications that Nike and Apple jointly designed for the Apple Watch Nike+ edition.

* While the exclusive, Nike-inspired bands for the Apple Watch Nike+ are not available for purchase separately, same great alternatives are available on Amazon that take inspiration from the Nike band design.
* The Apple Watch Nike+ case is made from aluminum. Apple does not offer a stainless steel case for the Nike+ edition of Series 2. As mentioned, the device packs in the same hardware as its Series 2 counterpart: a faster processor with speedier graphics, a brighter screen, built-in GPS for precise activity tracking without an iPhone, swim tracking and water resistance up to 50 meters deep.
