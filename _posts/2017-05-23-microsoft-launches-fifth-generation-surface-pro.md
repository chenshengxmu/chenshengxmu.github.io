* At today’s media event held in Shanghai, China, where it promised to “show the world what’s next,” software giant Microsoft announced a fifth-generation Surface tablet, now called Surface Pro. The tablet/notebook hybrid device is being launched globally on June 15, starting at $799, the same price its predecessor Surface Pro 4 started at.
* Billed as “the most versatile laptop,” the new Surface has 13.5 hours of battery life, Intel’s seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” Core processor (the same chip powering Microsoft’s $999 Surface Laptop), a new Alcantara keyboard and a next-generation Surface Pen.
* As per Microsoft, Surface Pro has up to 50 percent better performance and 50 percent better battery life than it predecessor and 35 percent better battery life than an iPad Pro. Its 12.3-inch PixelSense touch display supports Microsoft’s Surface Dial and the new Surface Pen.
* “Now better than ever, the new Surface Pro combines uncompromising mobility with exceptional power and performance,” says the Windows giant.
* The device looks just like on the recently leaked press shots and includes a few new pen and keyboard colors. It sports a single USB Type-A port and Mini DisplayPort, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack and Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port, but no USB-C.
* The new Surface Pro will be available globally on June 15, starting at $799. Microsoft is offering Type Covers, now known as Signature Type Covers, in four color finishes—Burgundy, Platinum, Graphite Gold and Cobalt Blue—mirroring the colors of its Surface Laptop.
* The improved Surface Pen stylus features increased pressure sensitivity with up to 4,096 pressure points (from 1,024), tilt that adjusts the thickness and texture of your ink granularly, based on the angle of your pen, for artistic shading and true real-time writing.
* “Like putting pen to paper or brush to canvas, the new Surface Pen supports a natural, immersive experience that sets you free to create, learn, and express yourself in completely new ways,” explains Microsoft.
* Lastly, the new Surface will be available in an LTE cellular-enabled variant, which will be arriving this fall at a yet-to-be-disclosed price.
* For the first time, Microsoft will be selling Surface Pen separately for $99.
* Pre-orders for the new Surface Pro and Surface Pro Signature Type Cover begins later today in select markets at Microsoft Store, Microsoft.com, BestBuy.com and JD.com where available.
* The new Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks.
