* As has been the norm as of late, OS X releases of the latest jailbreak tools have lagged behind their Windows counterparts. The TaiG jailbreak, which released to much surprise early this morning is no exception.
* But what if you’re an OS X only user who doesn’t have access to a Windows machine? Are you left out in the cold waiting until TaiG decides to release an OS X version of its tool? Not necessarily.
* Inside, I’ll show you how easy it is to run a Windows virtual machine on OS X absolutely free of charge. Doing so will allow you to jailbreak iOS 8.1.2 even if you only have a Mac. Best of all, it’s absolutely free to do so. Check out our video tutorial after the break for the full how-to.
* Update: this post was originally created for iOS 8.1.1, but you can follow the same steps to jailbreak iOS 8.1.2 using the latest version of TaiG.
* Step 1: Download and install VMWare Fusion, which comes with a free 30-day trial

* Step 4: Launch Windows 7 via VMWare Fusion
* Step 5: Install VMWare Tools and reboot
* Step 6: Open Internet Explorer and download and install iTunes
* Step 7: Download TaiG for iOS 8.1.2 from our download page
* Step 8: Follow the steps outlined in our iOS 8.1.2 jailbreak tutorial to complete the jailbreak process
* Once you have your virtual machine configured, you can find it in ~/Documents/Virtual Machines/
* You can always use your Windows 7 virtual machine for future Windows-only jailbreaks that are sure to come up later on down the line. I highly recommend that you hang on to this virtual machine for future usage. I tend to place the virtual machine file for Windows 7 on a dedicated USB thumb drive.
* What do you use to run Windows? Do you have a dedicated Windows machine, or do you go the virtual machine or bootcamp route?
