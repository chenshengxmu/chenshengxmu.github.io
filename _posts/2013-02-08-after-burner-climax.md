* Originally released as an arcade machine way back in 1987, Sega’s high-adrenaline jet fighter action, After Burner Climax, has made a jump to the iPhone and iPad (it’s also coming soon to Android). The game puts you in the cockpit of the F-14D Super Tomcat, F-15E Strike Eagle or F/A-18E Super Hornet, each customizable with four paint jobs (standard paint, camouflage, special paint and low visibility).
* Load your aircraft with a bunch of high-tech weapons, take off into the skies and barrel through twenty different landscapes – like volcanoes, jungles, ice caps and more. Of course, the game’s really just an excuse for a bunch of orange explosions and total mayhem.
* Nevertheless, fans of some heart-pounding action (gee, I sound like a PR bunny) should consider giving After Burner Climax a try…
* As a nice bonus, you can enjoy Retina action on a big screen TV as After Burner Climax supports both HDMI and AirPlay video.
* The blurb:
* The classic arcade game After Burner has now returned for a new generation of gamers. After Burner Climax is fast and frantic action, putting you in the cockpit of the world’s fastest fighter plane. Dodge planes, rockets and bullets while trying to target multiple on-screen enemy aircraft.
* Built for all skill levels, everyone will be able to take to the air and blaze through a branching storyline and over 20 stages. Unlock achievements along the way to unlock exclusive Avatar Awards using your experience and expertise.
* And your full features list:

* If you don’t mind pretty basic and simple controls, raw arcade feel and the asking price of three bucks, we’ll forgive you for killing time with a mindless shooter that blazes fast.
* Yes, it’s a universal binary supporting all form factor iDevices natively.
* While it’s been a long time since I played a quality jet fighter shooter, I’m gonna stick with Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy.
* As you might have figured out, I’m not a big fan of the 1980-style arcade shooters.
