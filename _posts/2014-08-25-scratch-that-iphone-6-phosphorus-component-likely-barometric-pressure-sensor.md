* An eagle-eyed member of the MacRumors forum says the “Phosporus”component destined for the iPhone 6, leaked on Monday, isn’t a next-generation version of Apple’s M7 co-processor, but instead a barometric pressure sensor. It makes sense given the several rumors that have cropped up in recent months with word Apple plans a barometer used to measure atmospheric pressure in the iPhone 6.
* “The chip pictured has the part number BMP282. I’m 99.99% sure this is a Bosch barometric pressure sensor, similar to this part BMP280,” MacRumors forum member leecbaker writes. “Variants of one part often have slightly different part numbers- if Apple got Bosch to customize the chip for them with different packaging, or a slightly different measurement range, that would explain the difference in part number.”

* Apple has been known to special order parts through manufacturers, custom tailored to its iOS devices. Bosch says the BMP282 is commonly used for: enhancement of GPS navigation, indoor navigation (floor detection, elevator detection), outdoor navigation, leisure and sports applications, weather forecast, health care applications (e.g. spirometry), and vertical velocity indication (e.g. rise/sink speed).
* In June, new APIs found in iOS 8 betas referenced altitude data. One API called “isRelativeAltitudeAvailable” tells apps if a device “supports reporting relative altitude changes” – perfect for a barometer sensor described on Monday. Furthermore Sun Chang Xu, news chief analyst at ESM-China, relayed in March that sources close to the matter have revealed the iPhone 6 will feature pressure, temperature and humidity sensors.
* Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 6 at a media event on September 9. The iPhone 6 is rumored to come in both 4.7- and 5.5-inch form factors, packing a sleeker design and high pixel density.
