* Have you ever noticed that, by default, your iPhone and iPad give you an audible alert when you plug them in, but not when you unplug them? Why is that? It seems like it would serve a similar purpose–letting you know if your device is plugged in or not.
* Well whatever the reason is, it’s not something you have to worry about anymore. At least, not if you’re jailbroken. There’s a new tweak out in Cydia this week called ‘Unpower,’ and its one function in life is to alert you when your device gets unplugged…
* The tweak itself is about as simple as it gets. There’s no settings or anything to configure. Once you’ve downloaded it, it automatically goes to work. And each time you unplug your device, either from the wall or your computer, you’ll hear a brief audible tone.
* Now I know what you’re thinking, “why would I ever need this?” Well, let’s say you have an older USB cable going bad, to the point where you have to fiddle with it to get it to stay plugged into your device. This tweak would alert you if it got bumped or disconnected.
* Of course, not everyone is going to have a problem like this. And chances are, you don’t need to download Unpower. But it’s good at what it does—I tested it at least 20 times—and the price is right. You can find the tweak in Cydia, in the Big Boss repo, for free.
