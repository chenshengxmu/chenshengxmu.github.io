* The Apple TV 6.0 update that Apple pulled over the weekend is now once again available as an over-the-air download. The software features a number of new features, including support for iTunes Radio and more.
* Following the update’s initial release on Friday, there were several reports that the update caused errors for users, forcing them into a full iTunes restore. The newly updated software supposedly fixes those issues…
* As noted by 9to5Mac, the newly-available version of the ATV software carries a build number of 11A502, which is different than the old 11A470e version, indicating that Apple has made some changes to the firmware.
* Per usual, the 6.0 update for your Apple TV can either be installed by visiting the device’s Settings menu and navigating to General > Update Software, or by connecting it to iTunes. Obviously, both require Internet.
* In addition to iTunes Radio support, Apple TV software 6.0 includes a new feature called AirPlay from iCloud, a new iTunes Music Store application that lets you stream previous purchases, and a revamped Podcast app.
