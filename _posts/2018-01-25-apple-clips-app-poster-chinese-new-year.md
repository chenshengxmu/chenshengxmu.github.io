* Clips, Apple’s excellent iPhone and iPad app for creating beautifully animated 360-degree scenes and videos, was updated on App Store today with a few small changes.
* Clips 2.0.2 now includes all-new Apple-designed label and poster for Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in modern China or simply the Lunar New Year.
* Other noteworthy changes in this edition of Clips for iPhone and iPad include improved stability when browsing and recording selfie scenes on your iPhone X and a fix for an issue that caused the Top Secret poster to animate incorrectly during playback.
* As mentioned, this is but a minor update to Clips.
* The last major Clips 2.0 refresh came in November 2017, bringing iPhone X support, Star Wars stickers, the ability to record 360-degree selfie scenes and much, much more.
* Clips is a free download from App Store.
