* Smartphone leakster Benjamin Geskin, who has a solid yet not perfect track record in leaking phone parts, this morning posted images of claimed glass panels for 2018 iPhones.
* The images purport to showcase three differently-sized glass panels for 2018 iPhone models, with the one measuring 5.8 inches almost certainly designed for a second-generation iPhone X model. The other two should fit a rumored Plus-sized iPhone X model at 6.5 inches and a new lower-priced model with an LCD (not OLED) screen measuring 6.1 inches diagonally.
* Here’s a mockup based on the leaked parts.

* The 6.1-inch LCD device should have thicker bezels than the OLED-based phones. For what its’ worth, Samsung—just like Apple—is expected to super-size its smartphone lineup with a trio of new Galaxy S10 models due early next year featuring similar screen sizes.
* What do you make of these images?
* Let us know in the comments!
