* Apple already posted their official iBooks 2 video, now they’ve posted their official video for iBooks Author.
* We’ve covered iBooks Author already in our media event coverage, and via our own hands-on time with the app, and we came away pretty impressed with its easy of use.
* Be sure to check those out, along with Apple’s own video if you’re at all interested about the changing landscape of desktop publishing.
* You can also visit Apple’s official iBooks Author page to watch the video and glean more information about the content creation tool.
* Have you downloaded it yet?
