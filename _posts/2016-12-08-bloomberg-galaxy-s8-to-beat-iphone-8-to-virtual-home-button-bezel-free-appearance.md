* Samsung’s next-generation Galaxy smartphone appears to be poised to beat Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 to the punch now that Bloomberg has corroborated much of SamMobile’s report saying the Galaxy S8 will be a bezel-free device with a wraparound display featuring an in-screen Home button. The phone should be unveiled in February 2018 and launch in March.
* That way, the Samsung device should enjoy a six-month lead over the iPhone 8’s expected fall arrival. However, the Korean giant is considering scrapping plans for a dual-camera on the Galaxy S8 due to “higher manufacturing costs”, one of the sources told the news gathering organization.
* “Samsung will create an all-screen front for the Galaxy S8 smartphones coming out next year and scrap the physical Home button,” people with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. “The bezel-less displays will provide more viewing real estate while a virtual home button will be buried in the glass in the the lower section,” reads the article.
* The S8 will have chassis of a similar size to the preceding model, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and the 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge, sources added. Unlike its predecessors which are available in normal and curved-screen variants, the new Galaxies will only come with wraparound Super AMOLED displays.
* Samsung is by and large the world’s top supplier of AMOLED panels.
* The device will use either Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chips or Samsung’s in-house designed Exynos processors. The article reiterates that Samsung also plans to introduce a souped up version of its digital assistant, S Voice, alongside the updated phones.
* The improvements made to S Voice are likely based on Vivo, an advanced artificial intelligence assistant founded by the developers of Siri that Samsung recently acquired.
* The South Korean company confirmed last month that the Galaxy S8 will come with new artificial intelligence features “significantly differentiated” from those in the market.
* From Bloomberg’s write-up:
* Apple plans to ship at least one iPhone using OLED next year, featuring a new look that extends glass from the display to the device’s back and edges, a person familiar with the plan said last month. It’s also said to plan a virtual Home button.
* Planned March 2017 launch for the Galaxy S8 could be delayed until April because the firm’s adopted “tougher testing procedures” in the wake of the Note 7 debacle.
* Apple may have something special in store for the iPhone’s tenth anniversary in the form of an OLED iPhone 8 model joining LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.
* The OLED iPhone should have an active display area between 5.1 and 5.2 inches diagonally and use the superior AMOLED screen technology for better, higher-resolution images at a fraction of the power required to drive an LCD panel.
* The device should switch from metal to all-glass enclosures and introduce an all-new industrial design based on a seamless edge-to-edge curved-screen. Likely to be called iPhone 8, it’s said to integrate the Home/Touch ID button behind the display, too.
* And if Apple manages to remove the top bezel by putting the earpiece, the front-facing camera and the sensors behind the display, it might engineer a fullscreen iPhone.
