* Super Mario Run, Nintendo’s eagerly awaited platformer optimized for one-handed gameplay, requires a persistent Internet connection to play in order to prevent piracy, Mario’s creator Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed to Mashable. Actually, the security element is one of the reasons Nintendo decided to go with the iOS platform first before releasing Super Mario Run on Android.
* Here’s what he said:
* This is just—based on the current development environment—a requirement that’s been built into the game to support security and the fact that the three different modes are connecting to the network and interacting with one another.
* Unlike our dedicated game devices, the game is not releasing in a limited number of countries. We’re launching in 150 countries and each of those countries has different network environments and things like that. So it was important for us to be able to have it secure for all users.
* As of yesterday, users can test-drive Super Mario Run at Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores ahead of its scheduled December 15 debut on the App Store. Andrew took Mario for a quick spin in his local Apple Store, here’s his brief hands-on video.
* Nintendo did mull the possibility of making World Tour available standalone so it could be played without an Internet connection. However, doing so would have “complicated the connection” back to the Toad Rally and Kingdom modes which are relying on the network save feature.
* “We wanted to be able to leverage that network connection with all three of the Super Mario Run modes to keep all of the modes functioning together and offering the game in a way that keeps the software secure,” said Miyamoto.
* By the way, Toad Rally mode challenges players to collect as many coins as possible while trying to beat the “ghost” of their competition.
* Super Mario Run will be a free download initially with an optional one-time $9.99 In-App Purchase to unlock the game’s three modes. You can sign up via the App Store to be notified when the game launches or download Super Mario Run iMessage sticker pack.
