* In what seems like the first bit of news from the jailbreak scene in quite a while, Chpwn announced today that an update for his popular Infiniboard tweak is now available in Cydia.
* The utility, which allows you to add an unlimited amount of icons to each springboard page, now works with Sakurina’s Iconoclasm and Ryan Petrich’s OverBoard tweak…
* For those unfamiliar with the two apps, Iconoclasm enables you to arrange icons on your device’s springboard in a number of free and premium layouts, and OverBoard is another springboard tweak that shows all of your home pages in a convenient overview. So needless to say, it’s nice that all 3 mods now play nicely together.
* It’s also worth noting that Chwpn recently updated the entire Infini-app suite to support iOS 6. So for those of you that can jailbreak the firmware, all 3 tweaks are now compatible.
* If you want to check out the new Infiniboard, you can find it in Cydia, in the BigBoos repo. The update is obviously free for previous owners, but it will cost new buyers $2.99.
