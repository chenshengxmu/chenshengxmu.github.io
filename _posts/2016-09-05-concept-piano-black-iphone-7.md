* Mac Otakara, a fairly reliable Japanese blog, recently learned that a claimed new Apple Watch-like Space Black color option for the next iPhone it originally described as Deep Blue actually resembles a Darth Vader-like glossy black. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo followed up with a report of its own, describing two new colorways replacing the current Space Gray choice: one called “Dark Black” and the other named “Piano Black”.
* Thanks to a new concept created by Arabic blog called AppleArab.com, we now have a good idea what an iPhone 7 Plus in the new glossy/matte finishes would look like.
* Image top of post is your glossy iPhone 7 Plus. Seen below: a comparison between glossy and matte finishes for the iPhone 7 Plus.

* As mentioned, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted two iPhone 7 case colors: “Dark Black” and “Piano Black”. These new color choices will apparently replace Space Gray which would get removed from the lineup.
* Kuo described Piano Black as giving the iPhone 7 a glossy appearance, but cautioned it could only be offered exclusively on high-capacity iPhone 7 models at launch due to low yields. Dark Black would presumably be a matte version of Piano Black.
* Assuming both Kuo and Mac Otakara are correct, the iPhone 7 lineup will offer five color choices: Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Piano Black and Dark Black.
* How do you like this little concept?
* And while we’re at it, which of the two new rumored iPhone 7 colorways would you pick, Piano Black (glossy) or Dark Black (matte)?
