* Surprise. Only a few hours after iOS 8.4 released, there is a working jailbreak. The tool, entitled PPGhost, is a Windows only jailbreak tool that works for iOS 8.4. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to jailbreak iOS 8.4 on your iPhone or iPad using the PP Jailbreak tool.
* There are some rumblings that PP took the code from TaiG, but we have not confirmed this. As such, you may want to wait for the TaiG tool update to jailbreak iOS 8.4. I personally prefer waiting, as it’s wrong to steal code, if the claims are true, which are difficult to prove. When TaiG releases their updated tool, we’ll post a tutorial, and deprecate this one. In the meantime…
* Note: Make sure that iTunes recognizes your device first. Make sure you have Find My iPhone off, Airplane mode on, and passcode off.
* Step 1: Download PPGhost for iOS 8.4 from our downloads page
* Step 2: Run PPGhost
* Step 3: Click the blue button while keeping the first PP check box checked
* Step 4: On the full PP tool, click the green button to begin the jailbreak. Click the button, and on the second screen click the second button to confirm that you’ve disabled Find My iPhone, etc. This will start the jailbreak
* Step 5: Just wait. Don’t touch anything, even when you see the white screen after the restore.
* Step 6: Once you see the completed message on the PP tool, wait until your iPhone boots to the Lock screen
* Step 7: Unlock and launch Cydia
* Again, TaiG claims that this code is stolen, but no proof has been provided outside of this tweet.
* After the release of iOS8.4, TaiG’s exploit isn’t blocked. BUT PP stole TaiG’s exploit for a jailbreak. The act should be strongly condemned
