* Wondering what’s new in iOS 5 Beta 5? Well, really not that much. At least nothing worth making a note of.
* BGR published the change log of iOS 5 Beta 5, listing everything that is new or that has been fixed in this latest release…
* You can workaround this by implementing the relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: method and checking to see if the writer actually wrote when your file presenter reacquires. You can also use FSEvents to observe file system changes
* These logs can grow large very quickly, so you should remove the profile after you have reproduced the problem and pulled the logs for the bug report.
* If you find anything else, please make sure to let us know.
