* Apparently the Easter Bunny left something else in our baskets last night besides eggs and candy. The notorious iDevice hackers released an update late yesterday to their PwnageTool software to successfully jailbreak 4.3.2 firmware.
* For those who haven’t been paying attention to the recent software updates, Apple pushed out 4.3.2 a few weeks ago to correct the iPad 2 Verizon 3G issues. While most original iPad users haven’t had a reason to upgrade, some have by either accident or design.
* The PwnageTool software has been a staple in the jailbreak community for years, and is usually the most reliable out of all the software options. The Dev Team are well known for not releasing exploits until they’ve worked out all the bugs.
* iPad 2 owners, there’s still no word on the jailbreak for Apple’s latest tablet. Hackers like p0sixninja have tweeted that this is the slowest progressing jailbreak they’ve ever seen.
* For those who are looking to hack their original iPads with 4.3.2 software, sit tight. We will post an easy step by step tutorial on how to jailbreak your original Apple tablet with the latest firmware shortly.
