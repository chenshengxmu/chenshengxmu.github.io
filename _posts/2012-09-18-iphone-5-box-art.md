* Someone sent this to me in an email just a few minutes ago.
* This is, apparently, the box art for the new iPhone 5. How do you think it stacks up to previous box art?
* Be sure to share your comments below. Only a few more days left.
* Shout out to Elad W for the image.
* Note: As many of you have pointed out, this matches the black box available on Apple’s pre-order page for the iPhone 5.

* This lends even more credibility to the image’s authenticity.
