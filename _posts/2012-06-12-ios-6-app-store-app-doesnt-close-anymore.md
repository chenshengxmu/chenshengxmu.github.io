* One major annoyance I had with iOS so far is that anytime you download an application from the App Store, the app would close and take you back to the Home screen. If you want to download a new app, you have to launch the App Store app again, and repeat the process.
* iOS 6 puts an end to this small nonsense and now lets you download as many apps as you want without closing…
* Of course, jailbreakers aren’t stranger to this feature since the StayOpened tweak by @EvilPenguin_ has been doing just that since 2010.
* It might not change your life forever, but it will certainly make it a tad easier.
* Let us know if you find anything else that’s new in iOS 6!
