* NCCards is a recently released jailbreak tweak that ushers in a new interface for the notifications shown in Notification Center. The $2.99 tweak, now available on the BigBoss repo, brings new visual cues to notifications, but retains much of the functionality that iOS users are familiar with.
* Testing out NCCards reveals a promising feature-set with a few notable miscues. Watch our video walkthrough to see the tweak in action.
* Once installed, a new preference panel will appear in the Settings app. From there, it’s possible to configure various features of the tweak like theme, transparency, card collapse settings, and more.
* By default, NCCards is set up to automatically assimilate the color of the app icon pertaining to the notification. That means that if you receive a new Messages app notification, its card will feature a green header just like the Messages app icon itself. NCCards calls this Auto Color, and it’s probably a setting that you’ll want to keep enabled, seeing as its a flagship feature for the tweak.

* One thing that NCCards advertises is its ability to swipe right to dismiss all notifications involving a single app, or to long-press on the top of a card to quickly dismiss all notifications for all apps. The developer showcases this functionality in his teaser video found on Cydia, but I was not able to replicate this function on my device.
* Overall, NCCards is a solid tweak that brings a good-looking collapsible interface to Notification Center notifications. Your mileage may vary, however, when it comes to dismissing notifications.
* Is it worth $2.99? I guess it depends on how often you use Notification Center. I personally rarely use Notification Center so I don’t see it as being worth it for my particular usage habits. What about you?
