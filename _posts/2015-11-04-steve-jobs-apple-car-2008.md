* According to the famous iPod creator, former Apple engineer and Nest founder Tony Fadell, Steve Jobs did consider an idea of Apple building a car as far back as 2008, but ultimately decided not to move forward because he had other projects on his mind.
* In a video interview with Bloomberg, Fadell said that Jobs and himself discussed how a hypothetical Apple car would we build, what features it would have, what a dashboard would be like and so forth.
* “We had a couple of walks,” Fadell said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang. ”If we were to build a car, what would we build? What would a dashboard be? And what would this be? What would seats be? How would you fuel it or power it?”
* “The Detroit auto industry was almost dead,” Fadell said. “It was fun to kick those ideas around.”
* Ultimately, Jobs decided not to move forward at the time because he was busy with other Apple projects in the pipeline.
* “At the end, it was always like, we’re so busy, we’re so constrained… it’d be great to do it, but we can’t,” Fadell said. Jobs probably made a wise choice to shelve the project because battery technology for electric vehicles was in its infancy back in 2008.
* Fadell thinks the hardest part about building a car is on the connectivity front, not the actual car design and manufacture. 
* “A car has batteries; it has a computer; it has a motor; and it has mechanical structure. If you look at an iPhone, it has all the same things. It even has a motor in it,” he said. “But the hard stuff is really on the connectivity and how cars could be self-driving.”
* Tim Cook’s Apple, of course, is now widely rumored to be working on an electric vehicle, internally referred to as Project Titan. An Apple car is actually Silicon Valley’s worst-kept secret, judging by Apple’s numerous high-profile hirings of automobile engineers, electric vehicle experts and more.
