title: Kindle ad praises the iPads Retina display, but...

* Amazon’s advertising strategy took on an interesting twist indeed. Even though this commercial surprisingly praises both tablets, it paints the iPad as an overpriced choice versus the Kindle Fire HD, which starts at $199 for the seven-inch version.
* Both tablets offer “stunning HD”, the commercial proclaims. What Amazon “forgot” to tell viewers is that its 1080p screen is no match for the iPad’s Retina display: the latter has a million more pixels (2,048-by-1,536) than the Kindle Fire HD (1,920-by-1,080). Nothing like the good ol’ fine print, eh?
* And this is Amazon’s YouTube blurb:
* Our newest commercial shows iPad with Retina Display and Kindle Fire HD 8.9″ side-by-side. Both have large, stunning HD screens. In fact, you may not be able to tell the difference… but your wallet definitely can. Meet the new, larger Kindle Fire.
* In case you’re interested in Amazon’s tablet, you can save a cool $50 on the 8.9-inch cellular (4G LTE) Kindle Fire HD version by entering promotional code FIRELOVE at checkout ($30 on the Wi-Fi-only model).
* This offer is valid through February 8, 2013, while supplies last. Only U.S. shoppers can apply and the promotion is limited to one discount per customer.
* I’m being curious: would you rather buy a seven-inch Nexus or Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD?
