* Lee Clow, the Chairman and Global Director of one of the world’s leading ad agencies, TBWA\Worldwide (and also its former Chief Creative Officer) is something of a living legend in advertising circles.
* Advertising Age likened him to “advertising’s art director guru” and he was a personal friend of Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs. This is the guy who co-created Apple’s ‘Think Different’ slogan, the iPod silhouettes ad series and the company’s famous ‘1984’ ad.
* The ‘1984‘, as you know, is now widely regarded as one of the most memorable and successful American television commercials of all time.
* In this video captured at the PTTOW! summit, Clow talks the challenges of branding Apple and reveals interesting tidbits about his productive 30-year relationship with Steve Jobs…
* PTTOW!, an invite-only summit, brings together cultural icons and leaders of the world’s top brands who convene together to showcase the future of advertising.
* The video was discovered by Business Insider and runs nine minutes and 51 seconds long.
* According to the ad man, Jobs was influenced a lot by Sony’s branding strategy.
* The urban legend has it that Jobs, who once worked in an orchard, even in his twenties had dreamed about toppling the Japanese consumer electronics giant and having Apple become a household name akin to Sony.
* TBWA/Media Arts Lab – often referred to as the ‘Apple ad factory’ – collaborates with Apple on ad campaigns in much the same secretive way Cupertino engineers its gadgets.
* According to a Gizmodo profile, select few execs from the two firms hold meetings in a building completely separate from the main TBWA/Chiat/Day headquarters. The facility, called Media Arts Lab, is solely dedicated to brainstorming Apple ideas and even regular Chiat employees aren’t allowed in.
* Not many have seen the inside of the shop, but considering the other, main building is decked out with an old Nissan (they’re a client) on the floor, a meeting room table made of surf boards, a bastketball court in the middle of a sea of cubicles, and a freeway billboard over the lunchroom.
* The creative staff that works on the project has never been connected to any leaked info, and access to the building is probably manned by a guard, 24/7. I do know for a fact that a fingerprint swipe is required for entry.
* TBWA’s most recent Apple work includes the inaugural iPad mini ad, seen above.
