* Yesterday I was telling you the  Dev Team is working hard on an unlock for iPhone 4. Some of you may have wondered why the Dev Team would be working on an unlock when a jailbreak is not even ready yet, right?
* That’s because according to MuscleNerd, a jailbreak for all devices at iOS 4 is already taken care of by the upcoming release of Spirit by Comex.
* Now the question is: when will Spirit for iOS 4 be available? With Apple supposed to release an update to iOS 4 in the upcoming weeks to supposedly fix the antenna issue, I doubt Comex will release Spirit beforehand and give Apple a chance to patch the exploit.
* I bet you can’t wait for Spirit for iOS 4, can you?
