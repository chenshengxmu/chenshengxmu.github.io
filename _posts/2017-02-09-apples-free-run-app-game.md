* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Chameleon Run. This means that for the next 7 days, you’ll be able to grab the popular autorunner for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $2.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, Chameleon Run is a unique, fast-paced runner with a colorful twist. Players must jump and run through expertly crafted levels, all while making sure their color matches that of the platform.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Developer Jan IIavsky came up with the idea for this gorgeous Apple Design Award winner after he’d broken his arm. He started on an infinite runner that could be played one-handed, and since he’s also colorblind, he added a gameplay element about changing between vibrant neon colors. Chameleon Run succeeds beautifully, balancing wicked speed with irresistible, just-one-more-try challenges.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Chameleon Run is available in the App Store for free.
