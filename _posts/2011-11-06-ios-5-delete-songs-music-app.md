* Here’s an iOS 5 tip that we at iDB already knew about, but many seem to have not noticed. iDB reader Brian emailed us and thought it would be a good thing to remind everyone, which I am doing now.
* iOS 5 has introduced a plethora of new features that make it even easier to manage data on your device. One of this new features allows you to delete songs directly from your Music app…
* If you go to the Music app (previously known as the iPod app), and swipe your finger across a song, you will have the option to delete that song. Simply tap “Delete” and the song will be gone from your music library.
* Of course, this does not delete the song on iTunes, and you’ll still be able to get this song back on your iDevice by syncing with iTunes.
* This tip is particularly helpful if you need to make room on your device quickly without access to a computer.
