title: The man who said no to Steve Jobs
---
* In Walter Isaacson’s popular biography of Steve Jobs, it was revealed that the Apple co-founder had apparently “cracked” the code of the Apple television set we’ve been waiting for. While speaking to a Brazilian TV network, Issacson admitted he left out a few details about the TV set from his book, out of respect for Steve Jobs and Apple.

* Of course part of building a TV set of such stature, Apple has to get TV networks on board for streaming. In a news report from Hollywood Report, CBS’s CEO Les Moonves reportedly said no to Steve Jobs over a content streaming partnership…
* Moonves said, while speaking at the UCLA Entertainment Symposium yesterday, that Steve Jobs approached him over a year ago to discuss the deal:
* CBS CEO Leslie Moonves said Saturday that he was approached about a year ago by Steve Jobs to provide content for Apple’s long-rumored television service but he declined to participate…Moonves told a conference audience that he met with Jobs, the late Apple CEO, and heard a pitch for what was billed as a subscription content service, but ultimately he said he wasn’t interested in providing CBS shows or films to the venture.
* Apple’s new TV set (not the set-top box announced last week) is said to be a game changer. And today’s comments out of Moonves, may confirm rumors that Apple has been trying to lock-in television networks for streaming content.
* Along with the rumored Apple TV set, the streaming partnership could have also been implemented into other products, like a streaming service. More than likely, Apple has also talked to other networks like NBC, ESPN, and more over similar deals.
* It’s not clear why Moonves would say no to Jobs. Perhaps it was over revenue concerns.
* “I told Steve, ‘You know more than me about 99 percent of things but I know more about the television business,’ ” Moonves said, citing his concerns about providing content to a service that could disrupt CBS’ existing revenue streams. Moonves said Jobs, in characteristic fashion, strongly disagreed with his assessment.
* We’re pretty sure he’s among the few men that have said no to the late Steve Jobs.
