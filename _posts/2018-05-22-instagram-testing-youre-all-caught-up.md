* It should show up for everyone once it officially launches.
* The company is testing yet another unlaunhred feature, dubbed “Usage Insights”, that was designed to tell customers a bit more—way more—about the time they spend on Instagram.
* “Understanding how time online impacts people is important, and it’s the responsibility of all companies to be honest about this,” Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom said recently.
* He added that the company aims to be part of the solution.
