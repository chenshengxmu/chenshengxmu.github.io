* Apple chose not to provide a live video stream of its iPad education event earlier today, but it has just uploaded a video of the proceeding for the folks who’d like to go back and watch it. The recording, which lasts just over an hour, is available on Apple’s website here.
* For those that missed our coverage, Apple today introduced a new 9.7-inch iPad that supports its Pencil stylus and a host of new apps and app updates for the classroom. If you’d rather watch in iTunes, or on YouTube, we expect copies of the event to be posted there shortly.
