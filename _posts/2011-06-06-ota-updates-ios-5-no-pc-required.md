* Apple just dropped a bombshell. As the rumors correctly predicted, Apple will be bringing over-the-air iOS updates. And instead of having to plug your device into iTunes on a PC to initially register, you will be able to active an iDevice from the device itself- out of box.
* OTA firmware updates and backups will be introduced in iOS 5, and you can now say that you’ve officially “cut the cord.”

* Scott Forstall,
* “So you no longer need to plugin to update your software. And they’re now Delta updates. Instead of downloading the whole OS, you only download what’s changed.”
* Intermittent iOS OTA updates- there you go. No clue how this will affect the jailbreak scene.
