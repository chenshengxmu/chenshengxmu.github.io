title: Loathe iPhone cases? Twelve South's SurfacePad will change your mind
---
* I generally dislike cases because they add bulk to my Apple devices and hide their beautiful design. Twelve South hears your pain: today, the premium accessory maker launched the SurfacePad, a cover for the iPhone 5/4/4S that’s less than 1/10th of an inch thick. It’s made from premium Napa leather and attaches with the same special adhesive used on our SurfacePad for MacBook.
* It has the microfiber lining which helps protect your devices’ glass from scratches and dings, a built-in stand so you can prop up your device for FaceTime, to enjoy videos or to simply turn your iPhone into an alarm clock. The clever design gives you access to all buttons and ports – and you can charge the device with the case on.
* The ultra-thin leather shields your device from dings and scratches and comes in a variety of colors and weighs less than one ounce. Go past the fold for more tidbits and a few nice PR shots…
* But how do you dress up your iPhone in a SurfacePad?
* Easy, it has a sticky back which adheres to the back of your iPhone, but don’t worry- they use the same special adhesive as one for the SurfacePad for MacBook. It’s re-useable and TwelveSouth claims it can be removed and added hundreds of times.
* 9to5Mac editor Seth Weintraub had a chance to try out the SurfacePad at CES and was impressed:
* I had a chance to use the SurfacePad at an event last night and can confirm that it is credit card thin and it feels great in the hand, taking the edge off of the iPhone’s square corners.

* Twelve South in a blog post makes the case for the SurfacePad:
* It’s not designed to withstand a two-story fall or a dip in the pool. SurfacePad shields your iPhone from the keys in your pocket and the concrete countertop at your favorite restaurant, all while letting the beautiful iPhone still look like, well, an iPhone.
* The minimalistic look is jaw-dropping.
* The stitching on the middle? That’s where the built-in stand flexes out

* Now, that’s what I call an iPhone case!
* More awesomeness right below.
* It’s so thin it virtually disappears.
