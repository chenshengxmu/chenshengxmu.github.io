* You know that boring old white flash that appears on your iPhone’s screen when you’re taking a screenshot? Wouldn’t it be nice if there was an option to spruce that up a bit?
* Likely, that’s the exact conversation the developer of Screenshot Picture had with himself as he was conceptualizing it.
* Inside, you’ll find a video walkthrough on this tweak, and learn how to make your screenshot taking experience a tad more interesting…
* Along with doing what its name implies — allowing you to designate a picture for the screenshot flash — the tweak also lends you the ability to set a solid color, or random color for the flash.
* Screenshot Picture is available for $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for jailbroken iDevices.
* If changing the screenshot flash sounds like a fun time, then this is the perfect jailbreak tweak for you, wouldn’t you agree?
