* Nick Bilton of the New York Times is out with a fantastic piece detailing why Google Glass as we know it has been killed off by the Mountain View based company. Born out of the futuristic Google X lab, the headset was not only plagued by problems, but it was receiving attention from the mass-market that Google just wasn’t ready for. 
* Google Glass saw an insane amount of hype – probably the most since the release of the original iPhone. It found itself in magazines, on late night television shows, and other forms of popular culture. But what was essentially a beta device wasn’t meant for that large of hype.
* “The team within Google X knew the product wasn’t even close to ready for prime time,” the Times reported, citing an unnamed former Google employee.
* Some of the hype may have been for the wrong reasons, as well. Google was seeing a ton of press attention for the Glass being banned from bars, driving, and more. The term “Glasshole” was also coined, and Google was having a hard time controlling the public’s perception of the wearable.
* “This wasn’t how Glass was supposed to be introduced. This wasn’t the quiet experiment that Google X engineers had hoped for as they tinkered away. It was like watching someone whisper a secret with a bullhorn,” Bilton wrote in his piece.
* Now Google has put the project under the direction of Ivy Ross, a jewelry designer. Most notably, Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive known as the father of the iPod and the founder of smart-devices maker Nest, is also charged with the device’s future.
* It’s being rumored that Fadell plans to rebuild Google’s wearable efforts from the ground up, having learned from the mistakes of Glass.
* I suggest you read the full New York Times piece for the full back story. It’s a great one.
