* Apple has seeded the first beta of OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite this evening. The update, labeled build 14B17, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Mac Dev Center for all registered developers.
* Today’s release comes nearly three weeks after Apple officially launched OS X Yosemite to the public, which brought about a number of improvements, including a redesigned UI, text message forwarding and more.
