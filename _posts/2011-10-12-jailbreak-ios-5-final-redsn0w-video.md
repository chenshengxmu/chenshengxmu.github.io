* iOS 5 is finally available to the public, and fortunately, it can be jailbroken with only a few simple steps.
* As of now, this is a tethered jailbreak, which means you must perform a tethered boot when rebooting your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad 1.
* Inside, we’ll show you step-by-step how to jailbreak iOS 5 with RedSn0w 0.9.9b3…
* As always, you can head over to our dedicated RedSn0w page for more information.
* Do you plan on jailbreaking iOS 5 now, or waiting until there’s an untethered iOS 5 jailbreak?
* Note: This works with iPod touch G3, and G4, iPad 1, iPhone 4, and iPhone 3GS.
