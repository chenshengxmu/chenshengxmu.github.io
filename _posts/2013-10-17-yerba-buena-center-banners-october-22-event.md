* With less than a week until Apple’s big reveal next Tuesday, October 22, banners are now going up the Yerba Buena Center for Arts building downtown in San Francisco, California.
* Banner design calls for a bunch of colorful leaves we saw on Apple’s invitation, possibly mimicking the iOS 7 color scheme or suggesting colorful iPads.
* Check out the images after the break and let us know what you think down in the comments section…
* Another photo reveals design plan for the banner.

* That’s what the Yerba Buena building will look like completely dressed up.
* And here’s Apple’s invite, for your analyzing pleasure.

* I’m still wondering about those Fall-inspired leaves.
* More shots follow.

* The Yuerba Buena Center for the Arts also served as a launchpad for the original iPad in 2010. And in years past, Apple’d used the venue to host other media events, such as the March 2012 iPad 2 introduction and the iPhone 5 announcement last September.
* The invitation-only presser will begin at 10am PDT / 1pm EDT and the iDB team will bring you the latest news as it happens.
* The iPhone maker will cater to international press unable to attend the San Francisco show by hosting simultaneous satellite streams in Berlin, Tokyo, Beijing and London, the latter beginning at 6pm local time at the Kings Place Hall.

* We’re expecting a fifth-generation full-size iPad with iPad mini-style design.
* Leaked parts have indicated a much thinner and lighter appearance for the iPad 5. As for the innards, an A7X chip – a version of the 64-bit A7 chip that powers the iPhone 5s enhanced with faster graphics and CPU – along with Touch ID fingerprint scanning are to be expected.
* The iPad mini 2 may or may not get the Retina treatment. Depending on whom you ask, it’ll run either an A6X or A7X chip. It also seems both devices will share Apple’s eight-megapixel iSight camera and come in Gold, Silver and Space Grey, just like the iPhone 5s.

* Also likely: OS X Mavericks release, Haswell-based MacBook Pro update and perhaps a next-generation Apple TV hardware. The sleek new Mac Pro, previewed at WWDC, is rumored for a November launch.
* Plea to readers: should you happen to be in San Francisco and don’t mind taking a few photos of the media event decorations, drop them on tips@idownloadblog.com and we’ll update the article accordingly.
