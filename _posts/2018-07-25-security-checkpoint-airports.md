* Traveling has long been a nightmare especially when airports are involved.  New technology could eventually end one of the biggest headaches of this type of travel: having to remove items such as laptops and iPads from our bags during the security check.
* According to American Airlines, it’s testing new 3D scanning technology through a collaboration with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The scanner currently at the Terminal 8 security checkpoint at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) replaces the 2D scanners being used at airports worldwide.
* With 3D scanning, items no longer have to be removed from bags. Instead, the TSA agents can tilt and rotate the scanned image using a tablet to see all the objects in the bag.
* As the airline explains:
* Because CT technology is three dimensional (3-D), this new checkpoint technology has the potential to provide better visibility and allow the operator to rotate the bag’s image 360 degrees to show the contents of carry-on items at every angle. CT provides the capability to virtually see beyond unwanted clutter and greatly enhances the ability to visually inspect the contents of carry-on bags for explosives and other prohibited items.
* Electronic devices aren’t the only items we could someday keep in our bags. With CT technology, airports could eventually allow you to leave liquids, gels, and aerosols, in your carry-on bags at all times.

* Not surprisingly, it could be a while before this type of technology comes to every airport in the United States and the world. A TSA spokesperson told CBS News it could be five years before CT technology goes mainstream.
* TSA expects the new CT technology will begin operation at JFK in late July. CT technology is also being tested at airport security checkpoints in Phoenix and Boston.
