* Apple is expected to unveil the next-generation iPhone during a media event on September 12. And apparently, the handset will become available for pre-order the same day.
* According to a new report, Apple is planning to start accepting pre-orders for the new iPhone on September 12, with its actual release still slated for the following Friday…
* iMore’s Rene Ritchie reports:
* “A couple of weeks ago iMore reported that Apple would be holding their iPhone 5 event on September 12, 2012. We’ve since learned that iPhone 5 pre-orders are currently planned to being that same day, at least in the U.S. Release is still planned for 9 days later, on September 21, 2012. We’ve also learned that the second wave of iPhone launches, the ones in international markets, will begin in the first week of October, likely October 5.”
* The note goes on to point out that this move wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for Apple, as last year, iPhone 4S pre-orders became available the same day as it was unveiled, October 7.
* And there’s no doubt that Ritchie has some quality sources — he was the first to report on the September 12 event date, which has since been confirmed by a number of news outlets.
* In addition to the new smartphone, Apple is expected to introduce a slew of other new products next month including a smaller version of its iPad, and other revamped iOS devices.
