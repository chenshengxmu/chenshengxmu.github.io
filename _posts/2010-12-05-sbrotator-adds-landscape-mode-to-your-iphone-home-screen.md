* Most apps in iOS support both portrait and landscape mode. The iPad even supports portrait and landscape on the home screen. Apple has limited the iPhone’s home screen to portrait mode only, but there is now a jailbreak tweak for adding landscape rotation to your iPhone’s home screen.
* SBRotator changes your home screen to match your iPhone’s orientation, just like most apps will already do in iOS. If you have been dying to have this capability since you saw the iPad’s rotated home screen, you should be very happy with SBRotator…
* SBRotator gives you excellent control over how you want landscape mode to work on your home screen. When you install the app you get a settings tab of customizations for SBRotator. Getting the right landscape mode look can be a little tricky, so it’s nice to have options.
* In the settings pane for SBRotator, you of course have a switch for turning the tweak on and off. SBRotator works with Activator for all kinds of different activation methods.
* You can even turn off portrait mode if landscape is all you want. If you want a full landscape experience, I would also install LSRotator to rotate your lock screen.
* SBSettings even works well with SBRotator. You can use SBSettings the exact way you would in portrait mode.

* An orientation change of your home screen requires an icon layout change as well. I use the iPad-style layout of 4×4 to 3×6 with 16 icons max. I also chose to hide the icon labels and I left the wallpaper mode to zoom rather than stretch. Things will look bad when you first use SBRotator because your icons need to be scaled down in landscape mode. I scaled my icons down to 85%. There’s plenty of size options to play around with.

* SBRotator is a great tweak that works smoothly. I haven’t noticed any bugs or weird side-effects of the icon tweaking. Pick it up for $1.99 in the Cydia store. Make sure to install “SBRotator for 4.x” if you’re on iOS 4 and “SBRotator” if you’re on 3.x firmware.
* What do you think? Have you been wanting landscape mode on your home screen?
