* Rumors of a third-generation iPad mini arriving in 2015 (ahead of another rumored device, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro) rather than alongside the iPad Air 2 as previously suspected may have been greatly exaggerated after all, according to the fairly accurate Japanese blog MacOtakara [Google Translate] which today asserted that the Cupertino firm is in fact going to refresh the smaller device alongside its bigger sibling at this Thursday’s press conference.
* The event should unsurprisingly see the addition of new colors to Apple’s Smart Cover case lineup, said to receive a tweaked design to accommodate the changes in the iPad’s form factor.
* Last month, Taiwanese media claimed that the Retina iPad mini 2 could get delayed to early-2015. That story followed a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said he expected only a minor iPad mini refresh this year centered around Touch ID fingerprint scanning functionality.
* For the sake of balance, Kuo in his note to clients erroneously called for an iPad Air 2 unveiling at Apple’s iPhone 6 event.

* It’s easy to back Kuo’s delay theory by the apparent lack of related component leaks, as opposed to a bunch of claimed iPad Air 2 parts we’ve seen thus far.
* For example, a high-resolution image of a claimed printed circuit board earlier this morning gave us  glimpses of a square chip with the “A8X” branding and 2GB of Elpida-branded RAM, fueling speculation that either an ultra high-resolution screen may be in tow for Apple’s next-generation tablets or the rumored split-screen multitasking functionality (or both).
