* If you worry about your privacy more than most, then you might want to go beyond a simple passcode to protect your iPhone’s valuable data. Fortunately, a new jailbreak tweak called BioProtect X (iOS 11) by iOS developer Limneos can help.
* As the name implies, BioProtect X can protect apps and other important things on your device. The tweak supports various security measures for doing so, including Face ID, Touch ID, or a traditional passcode.
* The name may sound familiar, and that’s because it is. It’s a complete re-write of the popular BioProtect jailbreak tweak, but with iOS 11 in mind. BioProtect X works great with the iPhone X’s proprietary Face ID authentication method, but don’t be fooled; it supports older authentication methods too.
* There are several things you can protect with BioProtect X, such as:

* You’ll also notice that the tweak harnesses Apple’s native Face ID animation when unlocking via Face ID, and this feels like a wonderful touch regarding aesthetics.
* Citing the Cydia description, Face ID and Touch ID scans are nearly instantaneous and shouldn’t hinder the speed of your workflow. On the other hand, you can take advantage of substantially more security by implementing them.
* If you’re interested in trying BioProtect X, then you can download it for $2.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices; other jailbreakers that rely on iOS 7-10 can use BioProtect, the new tweak’s predecessor.
