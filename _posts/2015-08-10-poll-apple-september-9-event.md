* Apple has reportedly scheduled a media event for Wednesday, September 9, to announce not just new iPhones but other product refreshes, too. Well-connected John Paczkowski, Managing Editor for BuzzFeed San Francisco, has it on good authority that the press conference will serve as a launchpad for next-generation iPhones and iPads.
* Moreover, there’s even a brand new Apple TV hardware in tow that should be unveiled during the event. With that in mind, we want to learn what you, our readers, are most excited about for the September 9 event.
* Sources told Paczkowski the event will focus on next-generation iPhones with a pressure-sensitive Force Touch display, an improved camera system and a significantly faster and power-efficient wireless chip.

* Apple should also show off latest iPad upgrades and a long-awaited successor to the $69 Apple TV media-streaming box with Siri voice commands, an App Store for downloadable apps and games, a faster chip, an increase in on-board storage, an all-new touch-enabled remote and a slimmer and lighter design.
* As for a rumored 12.9-inch ‘iPad Pro’, that device “seems to be a wildcard.”
* We’re focusing on three product launches Paczkowski’s sources are expecting to see come September 9: all-new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices with Force Touch, next-generation iPads (likely a fourth-generation iPad mini and a third-generation iPad Air) and an Apple TV hardware refresh.
* With that in mind, cast your vote now.
* What are you most excited about for Apple’s September 9 event?
* Personally, I can’t wait to see what the future holds for the company’s media streamer and am especially excited about the prospect of the Apple TV becoming a game console with a touch remote, downloadable App Store games in full HD resolution and, why not, Kinect-like motion sensing.
* I find it both interesting and peculiar at the same time that Apple would launch new iPads alongside new iPhones at the same event. Traditionally, September used to be for new iPhones and there was another media event in October to announce new iPads.
* This has been going on since 2012 so if Paczkowski’s sources are right we’ll see iPad and iPhone events consolidated into one media presentation, with a few sprinkles of Apple TV magic thrown in for good measure.
* We won’t know for sure, of course, until Apple officially announces and holds its event, but we can still speculate. So don’t be shy, join us in the comment section below to explain your vote in detail and tell us about your expectations for September 9.
