* The Apple Watch, when it starts shipping next year, will require daily charging, suggesting the device’s built-in battery lasts about 24 hours, Re/code journalist John Paczkowski said Wednesday. Apple is reportedly ”not happy“ with the battery life and is working to improve it before the product’s early-2015 debut.
* Regardless, Apple still expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. At no point during the yesterday’s unveiling did Apple specify or mention how long the device’s battery will last.
* Even Apple’s promotional images don’t appear to show the battery indicator on the device’s Home screen.
* Paczkowski learned from Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris that the Cupertino firm is “working on various modifications” ahead of the device’s early-2015 launch that should improve the 24-hour battery life.
* “There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,” Kerris said.
* “We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,” she added.

* The 24-hour battery life is in line with most other smartwatches.
* As for Motorola’s Moto 360, reviewers specifically slammed its battery which they say requires recharging after just a few hours of use.
* The Apple Watch starts at $349 and will be available in early-2015.
* Would you mind charging your Apple Watch overnight?
* And are we unreasonable to expect a strong battery inside such a tiny form factor?
