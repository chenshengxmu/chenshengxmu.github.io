* Fleksy, the powerful iOS 8 keyboard which lets you use gestures, GIFs and emoji, has increased its functionality in the latest update issued today.
* Now the app features an integrated Sticker keyboard in partnership with Imoji, taking visual communication beyond animated GIFs. You can easily browse, search and send Imoji stickers directly in Fleksy: just tap a sticker to copy it, then paste it in a message.
* To add a sticker to your favorites, double tap it from the keyboard. You can access your recently used stickers, browse endless collections of reactions,  check out what’s trending and more.
* To access Imoji stickers, update your copy of Fleksy Keyboard to the latest version. Then, switch to Fleksy in any app, tap the rightmost key at the bottom to access emoticons and you’ll see a new Imoji option in the right corner at the top.
* Tap it and you’ll be taken to the wonderful world of Imoji stickers. Simply browse the collection and tap a sticker to copy it to the clipboard, letting you paste it in apps like Messages, Mail and more. Stickers are inserted as PNG images with transparency.
