title: The Magnus Mini iPad stand is a minimalist obsession

* Ten One Design is mostly known for the Pogo Stylus, which comes in multiple designs. Bumping into the team at CES, I was able to get a glance at the Magnus Mini, their new iPad mini stand. It is one of the most simplistically designed iPad stands I have ever used. With just a small base and a minimal lip, iPad is held at a perfect angle to remain standing with as little effort as possible.
* In comparison to other much more complicated docks or stands, the Magnus Mini is a welcomed change to the otherwise overly dramatic iPad dock arena…
* The secret behind the Magnus Mini’s minimal design is magnets. The age old secret of many devices that require a little extra grip. Inside the small lip on which the iPad rests, is a row of 10 magnets to keep things taut. Although the iPad is quite readily affixed to the stand, a very smooth rubberized surface provides a scratch resistant connection. Magnets keep the iPad affixed, even when moving around the house, but it can be disconnected very simply without much pressure.

* From the front, the iPad keeps a clean profile, due to the thin stand design. When facing iPad directly, there is only 1 or 2mm between the surface and the device, making the Magnus Mini stand almost completely invisible.
* At 19 grams, the Magnus Mini will add no noticeable weight to your device and is a perfect travel companion. My last trip to California included the lightweight Magnus Mini and I did not notice its addition among many other iOS accessories. It is great for using on an airplane tray table or your everyday office desk.

* At $26, there is a little hesitation. I really enjoy the Magnus Mini stand, especially its lightweight and simplistic design. You can even flip iPad over and use the stand for an elevated typing angle. However, I would be a little more comfortable at $19.99.
* The product is high quality, especially with the scratch resistant coating. It easily holds your device with minimal interference and at a reasonable angle. But with the inability to adjust the viewing angle, pick multiple colors, use it with an iPad Air, or adhere it to a surface, there are reasonable expectations that are not met at a $30 suggested retail price.
* Overall, I still say give it a go, but make sure you are truly invested in the purchase.
