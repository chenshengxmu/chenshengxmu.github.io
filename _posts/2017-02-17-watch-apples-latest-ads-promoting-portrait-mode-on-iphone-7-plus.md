title: Watch Apples latest ads promoting Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus
---
* Lately, Apple has been amping up its advertising efforts concerning its flagship dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus model, as part of its broader “Shot in iPhone” campaign. Following its “Creek” and “Soul Mate” ads earlier this month which showcased Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus and prior commercials highlighting the handset’s enhanced low-light photography features, the company yesterday posted two new ads on its YouTube channel, titled “Boyfriend” and “Profile Picture”.

* “When you shoot in Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, it softens the background. That’s the difference between a good picture and your profile picture.”
* “When you shoot in Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, your subject stands out from the background. And just like that, your boyfriend becomes your boyfriend.”
