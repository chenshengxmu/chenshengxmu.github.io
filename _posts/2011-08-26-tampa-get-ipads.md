* iPads find their way into all kinds of places, and they’re going to be an integral part of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ kit when the season begins. The team and its staff got sick of carrying around the old fashioned Yellow Pages-like playbooks of yesteryear. What could they replace them with? Well, iPad 2s of course!
* Now, the 90-strong team will each receive an iPad 2 for referencing plays and NFL video archives…
* Not only will the team be able to dump that boring old paper playbook, but they have also discovered that the iPad 2 has an ace up its sleeve in the form of video.
* The iPads will be used to show video of plays, video of training sessions, and probably even videos of their huge checks hitting their bank accounts if they get their own way!
* Unfortunately, no one at the Buccaneers thought that BlackBerry’s ‘PlayBook’ would be the perfect fit for the job, which perhaps once again proves that RIM’s choice of name was a monumentally bad one!
