* Apple has relaunched the My Support website with an all-new design featuring bolder headings and adaptive layout to match the look of the rest of Apple.com. Available through the new address at mysupport.apple.com, the overhauled site has all the same features like the old one, which debuted back in 2011.
* Upon logging in with your Apple ID, you can register your Apple product by typing in a serial number, which lets you access various support options and do things like track repairs, check on a device’s warranty status and much more.
* You can give products nicknames, reorder them, sort them by device category or coverage status and more. Other options include the ability to browse your repairs within the past 90 days, look up a repair by entering your Repair ID or a product’s serial number and so forth.

* Some of the features of the old site are nowhere to be found on its redesigned counterpart.
* That’s because some of them have been relocated elsewhere or integrated into the redesigned Apple ID or Apple Support webpages, like the ability to edit your contact information.
* While the old site let you add an AppleCare protection plan to hardware, that features is absent on the new site because, as of recently, all of Apple’s AppleCare plans for Macs, iPads and iPhones must be bought alongside a new device or within 60 days of purchase and they’re automatically registered to your Apple ID.

* The site provides a Contact Us link that leads to Apple’s webpage where you can find various support options that are available to you, based on your country and products.
* Like before, you can see a history of your support interactions and AppleCare coverage eligibility, access product manuals, guides, technical specifications and support pages for your products, view previous replacements of products and more.
* Many people were unaware that this site existed in the first place because finding it without remembering the URL was impossible. I remember having to Google “where can I find all my registered Apple products” just to get to that page.
* Even though the Apple ID site shows all your devices, older hardware with no iCloud support isn’t displayed there. At the revamped My Support site, you can easily find all your Apple products, including all your iCloud-authorized devices and any manually registered products.
