* Following a February story by Fast Company saying iPhone 8 would cost more than $1,000, maybe even $1,200 or more, The New York Times is claiming in a new report Thursday that Apple is now looking to sell its highly anticipated OLED phone “for around $999”.
* According to people briefed on 2017 iPhones, Apple’s new premium handset will be priced at around $999. If true, that will almost certainly be the asking price for an entry-level iPhone 8 model. Apple is said to offer iPhone 8 in three storage capacities—64GB, 256GB and 512GB—and if history is anything to go by, each storage increment should cost an additional $100.
* For comparison’s sake, Samsung’s latest Note 8 with a 6.3-inch AMOLED screen, 64 gigabytes of base storage, dual cameras with optical image stabilization and a water-resistant S Pen stylus will retail for $960 at Verizon, $930 at T-Mobile and $950 at AT&T.
* All iPhone 8 devices are expected to feature a dual-lens camera on the back with optical image stabilization on both wide angle and telephoto lenses, as well as three gigabytes of RAM to support processing data from two cameras simultaneously.
* The New York Times report reiterates a few other previously rumored features of Apple’s upcoming tenth anniversary handset, including a 5.8-inch screen based on OLED technology, skinnier side bezels and little or no forehead/chin on the face of the device.
* “Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction,” the sources said.
* The Cupertino company is expected to announce the OLED iPhone, along with iterative updates for the iPhone 7/Plus family, at a media event next month, possibly on September 12.
* We’re expecting invites to go out next week.
