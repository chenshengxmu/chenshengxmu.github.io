* Google yesterday pushed an iPhone X-focused update to its Hangouts for iOS app on App Store.
* Hangouts is a communication platform developed by the search giant itself which includes instant messaging, video chat, SMS and VOIP features.
* If you use the app on your iPhone X to exchange instant messages with your friends and family, update your installed copy of Hangouts to version 21.0 or later.
* The update gets rid of the ugly black bars at the top and bottom of the display which appear when an app has not been optimized to take full advantage of the iPhone X display resolution.
* Aside from iPhone X support, no other changes or fixes were mentioned in release notes.
* The Google-owned Zagat app and Google Trips were refreshed with iPhone X support earlier this week. Just last week, Google updated the Play Music app for iOS with iPhone X support.
* Download Hangouts for free from App Store.
