* Apple has named Mattel’s ‘Whac A Mole’ its App of the Week for this week. This means that from now through next Thursday, you’ll be able to pick up the title for both your iPhone and iPad, for free—which will save you a buck.
* For those unfamiliar with it, Whac A Mole is essentially a touchscreen take on the classic arcade game with the same name. Players are given a mallet and tasked with navigating their way through 60+ levels by…whacking moles.

* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Channelling the manic energy of the old-time arcade game, Whac A Mole hands you a mallet and sends you down a first-person path, dispelling an onslaught of furry foes. Madcap humor and an arsenal of unique hammers keep the action light and entertaining across dozens of colorful 3D levels. 
* Admittedly, the game looks very silly, and Mattel has placed it in the ‘Kids aged 9-11’ category. But it does carry a 4.5 out of 5 star rating in the App Store, and reviewers have praised the app, saying “finally, a retro game done right.”
* If you’re interested, you can find Whac A Mole in the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad for free (for the next 7 days). It’s worth noting that there are a number of in-app purchases within the game, ranging in price from $1 to $20.
