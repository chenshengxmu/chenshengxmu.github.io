* Apple has seeded the first beta of iOS 8.1 to developers this afternoon, with build number 12B401. The release comes just a few days after the company posted iOS 8.0.2, and just a few hours after reports surfaced claiming that multiple iOS 8 updates were in the works.
* We’re currently installing the beta and will be updating this post with any changes we find. If you find any changes from previous versions, be sure to email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a comment below, preferably with a screenshot of the change or addition.
* Larger app icons in Widget Edit mode

* New ‘All Photos’ album, ‘Recently Added’ album is gone. It appears you get an “All Photos” if you activated iCloud Photo Library at some point, although we’re not 100% sure about that.

* Strangely, installing iOS 8.1 beta on another device brought Camera Roll and Photo Stream back. Apparently, you get Camera Roll back if you never activated iCloud Photo Library, although we can’t confirm that at 100%.
