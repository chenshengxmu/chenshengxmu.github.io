* Apple Pay expansion in international markets has accelerated lately, with the mobile payment system launching in France yesterday and now, just 24 hours later, in Hong Kong. According to Apple Pay’s Hong Kong website, the service is supported at launch by all three major credit card companies: Visa, American Express and MasterCard, with cards issued by Hang Seng Bank, Bank of China (Hong Kong), DBS Bank (Hong Kong), HSBC, Standard Chartered and AmEx.
* Bank of East Asia and Tap & Go will support Apple Pay in the near future, Apple confirms. The service can be used to pay for goods and services in compatible apps and at points of sale that accept contactless payments, including a bunch of retailers like 7-Eleven, KFC, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Pacific Coffee, Su-Pa-De-Pa, Taste, ThreeSixty, Uny and more.

* People in Hong Kong can add their eligible credit or debit card to Apple Pay in Apple’s Wallet app on their iPhone, by tapping the Add Credit or Debit Card button. The Wallet app also includes a built-in card-scanning option to avoid typing details manually.
