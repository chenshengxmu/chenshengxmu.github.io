* Apple is opening a pair of new retail stores in Seattle and Palo Alto this Saturday, June 30.
* Both stores now have their respective webpages up, announcing grand openings.
* The new retail outlet at the open air University Village mall in Seattle is scheduled to officially open to the public at 9:30am local time on Saturday, June 30. The new location will replace Apple’s existing store there that it has occupied since 2003.
* According to web reports, the retail outlet will incorporate Apple’s next-generation retail design and occupy about 14,000 square feet of a former parking, of which 8,000 square feet will be a specialized sales floor and areas dedicated to Today at Apple sessions.
* The new store in Palo Alto, California, located on the 340 University Avenue, is scheduled to open its doors to customers at 10am local time on Sunday, June 30.
* The visually stunning store closed for renovations back in May.
* Apple Stores have always served a bigger purpose than just selling. That said, it’s encouraging that the company is continuing to spare no expense investing in its retail expansion.
* Apple now has over 500 retail locations worldwide.
