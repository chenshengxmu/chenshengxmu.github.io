* Apple just announced its financial results for Q4 2012, and is now finishing up its earnings call. As promised, we’ve put together a list of some of the more interesting bits from the call to pass on to you.
* Among that list, is the fact that Apple added $4 billion to its growing cash pile last quarter, bringing its cash total to more than $121 billion. It also sold a stout 44 million iOS devices during that time…
* Again, this wasn’t really a blockbuster quarter for Apple in terms of sales numbers. But that’s more or less because it was a transitioning period for most of the company’s products.
* Apple refreshed nearly every one of its product lines in the last two months, and even unveiled a new tablet. So between that and the holidays coming up, we suspect a strong finish to the calendar year.
