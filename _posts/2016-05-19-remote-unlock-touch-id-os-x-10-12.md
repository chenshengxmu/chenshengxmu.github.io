* Apple engineers are designing a remote unlock function that would allow an iPhone to unlock a Mac when in close proximity, reports MacRumors. The feature would use the handset’s Touch ID hardware, and is slated for the upcoming OS X 10.12 update.
* The site notes that this will use Bluetooth LE frameworks, and will likely work similar to the solution found in the Apple Watch. Passcodes on the Apple Watch can be bypassed by entering your iPhone passcode or using Touch ID on the connected iPhone.
* It’s long been speculated that Apple would bring its fingerprint-scanning technology to its Mac lineups, but a software solution like this seems like it would be much simpler. Plus, there are already a few apps like MacID and Knock that offer similar functionality.
* Apple is expected to reveal OS X 10.12, alongside iOS 10 and other platform updates, at its developer conference in San Francisco next month. It’s been rumored that OS X will be rebranded as “MacOS,” and include long-awaited support for Apple’s Siri assistant.
