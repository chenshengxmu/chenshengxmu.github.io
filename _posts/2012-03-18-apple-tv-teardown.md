title: Apple TV contains 8GB of flash storage and 512MB of RAM
---
* We finally got our hands on the new Apple TV last Thursday and have had the chance to bask in its 1080p glory. While we already knew there was a single-core A5 processor inside, a forum user from XBMC.org has done a teardown of the device to reveal its insides.

* From the teardown, we find that the new Apple TV still has the same 8GB of flash storage like its second-generation brother, but has received a bump to 512MB of RAM…

* You’d think Apple would have upgraded the storage beyond 8GB to handle larger 1080p video files, but Cupertino-based Apple chose to stay with Toshiba’s drive. Since the Apple TV has such a reliance on streaming, file size won’t be that big of a deal. Netflix has already announced that it supports 1080p video streaming to compliment the new Apple TV.
* The 512MB of RAM, from manufacturer Hynix, is an upgrade from the past 256MB of RAM. The RAM boost may make things a bit snappier. Lastly, the third-generation device features a second antenna, but there’s no word on what that antenna’s use is exactly.
