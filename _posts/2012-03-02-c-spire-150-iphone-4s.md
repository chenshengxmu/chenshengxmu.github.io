* Although the iPhone 4S retails for around $650 (16GB model), most folks can pick one up for significantly less than that. Carriers will generally absorb a large amount of the handset’s cost as long as you promise to be a long-term customer.
* Here in the US, all of the major carriers offer the 16GB iPhone 4S for $199 along with a two-year contract. And C-Spire Wireless, a southeastern regional operator, offers the entry-level iPhone 4S for just $149…
* As noted by 9to5Mac, C-Spire just just lowered the price on all of its iPhone 4S models (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB) by $50, making each handset the cheapest we’ve seen to date from any US carrier.
* C-Spire Wireless serves around 1 million customers and although its home network is in southeastern states like Florida and Georgia, the carrier advertises nationwide coverage thanks to roaming partnerships with Verizon and Sprint.
