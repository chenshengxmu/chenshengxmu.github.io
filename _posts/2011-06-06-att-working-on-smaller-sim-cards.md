* In an interview at All Things Digital’s D9 conference, AT&T CEO Ralph de la Vega hinted that the mobile phone carrier is working on a new, smaller SIM card standard for future smartphones just as Apple is already confirmed to be.
* According to AppleInsider, the comment came after All Things Digital’s Ina Fried asked about the possibility of a new embedded SIM card as Apple had been rumored to favor, saving valuable space inside ever-shrinking handsets…
* “We think that making the card smaller and shrinking the size is a no-brainer and we should be able to make that happen.”
* The outspoken AT&T CEO stopped short of confirming the company was working with Apple, saying only that they were “working with the industry.”
* This isn’t the first time a carrier has spoken of moving to a new SIM card standard, even though the micro-SIM currently used in the iPhone 4 and iPad were only recently introduced.
* Back in May, France Telecom CE Stephane Richard said that Apple and carriers had come to an agreement over shrinking the cards, rather than going for a fully embedded solution – a solution that would stop users from swapping cards between phones, something more frequent in Europe than the United States. Richards also claimed the move would mean a ‘smaller and thinner’ iPhone in the future.
* Another loose-lipped insider at France Telecom-owned Orange claims Apple submitted a new requirement for the new form factor to a European standards institute earlier this year, ready for the next iPhone to be released later in 2011.
* During the same interview, de la Vega spoke of AT&T’s disappointment with the low sales of its Windows Phone 7 devices saying the fledgling platform, “hasn’t sold as well as Microsoft or us would want it to.”
* Shocker.
