title: If only this iPad mini parody clip was the real deal
---
* After watching this, I’m beginning to wonder if somebody at Apple should seriously consider hiring Cinesaurus, a Seattle-based creative team “obsessed with telling stories through video and animation”. They’re also behind an excellent Surface parody video that teaches Microsoft how to advertise against the iPad…
* The team describe themselves on Facebook:
* We work with clients nation-wide, both large and small, to create super cool videos with stellar branding.
* Cinesaurus churn out parody clips on a regular basis and let me tell you, their work is remarkably sophisticated.
* Watch this: youtu.be/a21_WMiTAVE because 1) we can do everything in this video and that excites us, 2) you won’t watch TV the same again.

* They for sure nailed that iPad mini parody clip.
* It could almost pass for the real deal if only there was such a thing as an iMac touch.
* But we can keep on dreaming, no?
