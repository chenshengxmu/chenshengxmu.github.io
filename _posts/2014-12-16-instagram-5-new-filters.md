* Instagram, a Facebook-owned mobile photography service, today issued an update adding five new filters to its iOS and Android app.
* In addition, the popular software has gained a couple handy enhancements such as the ability to upload Slo-Mo video content as well as real-time comments, photo perspective adjustments, a customizable filter tray with live previews and more.
* Inspired by the photography, art, fashion and design, the five new subtle filters available in Instagram 6.4 are being marketed as the company’s best yet and include: Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden and Perpetua.
* You’ll find the new filters at the front of your filter tray. “They soften and subtly shift colors to achieve the look and feel you want for your each photo,” said the firm.
* It’s cool that the new filters take advantage of “higher image quality” while still giving you a simple way to capture the mood, tone and feelings of the moment.
* To customize the filter tray, use a new Manage button found at the end of the filter tray, as shown below. Don’t worry, all of your filters are still available, it’s just that you can now personalize them to your liking by adding, hiding and rearranging the ones you see when posting a photo.
* Keep in mind you still can’t personalize video filters.

* The app changes how filters are displayed, too.
* For instance, each filter icon on the bottom now shows a blurred preview of your photo with its effect applied, making it a lot easier to see how your photo will appear with the effect applied.
* As mentioned before, you no longer have to manually refresh the comments as new ones now get delivered in real-time.
* And in addition to uploading your Slow-Mo clips to Instagram, the refreshed app now includes the option to adjust your photo’s perspective using the adjust tool.
* Instagram 6.4 changelog:
* Download Instagram free in the App Store.
