* Apple yesterday seeded first developer-only betas of iOS 11.4, tvOS 11.4 and watchOS 4.3.1, with the iOS and tvOS betas reinstating a pair of missing features that we were promised at WWDC back last summer: AirPlay 2 and Messages in iCloud.
* The first developer beta of what would become a fourth major software update to iOS 11 also brings support for HomePod stereo pairing and Apple’s new ClassKit framework.

* AirPlay 2 brings multi-room and multi-device control. With AirPlay 2, users are able to control audio playback and adjust volume across multiple AirPlay devices at once right from the Control Center on their iPhone or iPad, iTunes or the AirPlay menu on their Apple TV.
* Thanks to AirPlay 2, your Apple TV automatically appears in the Home app.
* AirPlay 2 also brings the ability for HomePod owners to connect two speakers to create a richer sound, requiring a matching HomePod beta software which hasn’t released yet.
