* A little more than a month ago, Yahoo added a slew of nice-to-haves to its native Mail for iOS app, including handy mail filters on the iPad and personalized web features to easily track scores, stocks, weather and more, all without switching apps.
* Today, a new update has surfaced in the App Store featuring welcomed search enhancements to the app’s built-in search feature.
* Now sitting at version 3.2, the refreshed software makes it easy to filter your results by emails, photos or files…
* “Now, when you search for a person’s name, you can easily filter the results by emails, photos or files,” writes Yahoo.
* I wish Apple’s stock Mail app had this feature.
* With an ever-growing avalanche of emails hitting our inbox, we need to be able to quickly distinguish between people and emails if we were to increases our mobile productivity.
* And if you exchange a lot of photos and files via email, the ability to show only photo attachments in your search results should be a nice time saver.
* I’m loving the UI for filtered photo attachments, check it out below.
