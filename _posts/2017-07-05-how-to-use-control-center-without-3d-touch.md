* iOS 11 offers more customization for Control Center than ever, allowing you to make it your own by disabling toggles you rarely use. If puts frequently used controls all on one page, many of which can be expanded to reveal additional options when pressed with 3D Touch.
* For instance, you can press the Home toggle lightly to bring up your HomeKit scenes, press the Now Playing toggle with 3D Touch to expand media controls, press the Apple TV Remote toggle to navigate your Apple TV or type some text into it, and much, much more.
* So far, so great. But what if your device lacks 3D Touch?
* Unlike prior iOS editions that didn’t provide a fallback mechanism for 3D Touch interactions on non-3D Touch devices, iOS 11 allows you to use all of the features the redesigned Control Center has to offer without having to own a 3D Touch device.
* Our resident video editor Andrew O’Hara details how iOS 11’s Control Center works on devices that don’t include 3D Touch features, like iPads and iPhone 6 and older models.

* In Andrew’s example, he long-taps the Brightness toggle to access controls for turning Night Shift on or off. You can long-tap other Control Center items that are expandable. For example, long-tapping the Volume control enlarges the slider as if you pressed it with 3D Touch.
* iPad lacks Taptic Engine so you won’t feel haptic feedback when long-tapping.
