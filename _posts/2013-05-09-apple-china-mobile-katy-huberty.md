* Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty was visiting Hong Kong and Taiwan recently. She is now back from China with some interesting Apple news. Tim Cook & Co., she wrote in her note to clients, may be close to striking an iPhone distribution agreement with China Mobile, the world’s top wireless carrier by revenue and subscribers.
* Specifically, Huberty wrote that “TD-LTE licenses, and related phone launches, are expected by year-end,” in her note to clients. China Mobile debuted small-scale TD-LTE network in 2010 and last year expanded coverage to select large cities. In case you were wondering, TD-LTE is a variant of the fourth-generation Long Term Evolution radio technology, also known as LTE…
* China-only TD-LTE is incompatible with current iPhones so Apple would need to use latest world-mode wireless chips (Qualcomm has one!) in the next iPhone if wants to sell its iPhone to China Mobile customers.
* As Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune notes, the development strongly suggests that a contract with China Mobile could be signed before the end of the year. DigiTimes, the Taiwanese industry publication, separately reported Wednesday that China Mobile will start bidding for 200,000 TD-LTE base stations in a hundred Chinese cities this month.
* China Mobile, by the way, has more than 700 million subscribers. The carrier has promised to carry out LD-LTE trials this year and Apple still continues to court China Mobile.
* As my colleague Ed told you yesterday, Huberty also wrote that production of “multiple new iPhone models” will commence in June or July, in time for a rumored September launch of a new iPhone.
* This echoes recent various reports from various other sources, including KGI Securities which sees Apple’s iOS hardware refreshes around Fall rather than during summer.
* Also noteworthy, Reuters said today that Apple’s contract manufacturer Pegatron, which expects declining second-quarter sales amid slowing demand for iPad mini and other consumer electronics, is now hiring 40,000 workers.
* The bolstering is thought to indicate that Pegatron is getting ready to assemble a rumored inexpensive iPhone model targeted at cash-strapped buyers in emerging markets who mostly buy off-contract unsubsidized devices.
