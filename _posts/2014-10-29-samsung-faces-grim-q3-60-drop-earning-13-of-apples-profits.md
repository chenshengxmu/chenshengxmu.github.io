* The situation for Samsung is a tad grim, as the South Korea-based company reported a 74 percent year-over-year decline in net profit during Q3. This marks Samsung’s fourth consecutive quarterly decline, and marks its lowest profit margin since the second quarter of 2011.
* Profits during the quarter sat at $3.9 billion, right on par with Samsung’s previous guidance. Revenues fell 20 percent to $45 billion when compared to the same quarter last year. As for Samsung’s mobile business, which ships more handsets than Apple, it saw a 60 percent year-over-year decline and only one third of the net profit Apple saw during the same quarter.
* Samsung says the drop in profits came from price cuts of older phones and “declined shipments” of high-end models. Going forward, the company thinks “new smartphone lineups featuring new materials and innovative designs, as well as a series of new mid- to low-end smartphones with strong competitive positioning on both hardware specifications and price,” will help get its business back to where it once was.
* “High-end smartphone sales result was somewhat weak,” said Kim Hyun-joon, senior vice president at Samsung’s mobile communications business. “We will fundamentally reform our product portfolio.”
