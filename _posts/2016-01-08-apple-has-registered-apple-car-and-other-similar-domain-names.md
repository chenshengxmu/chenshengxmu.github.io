* Apple has registered a handful of rather interesting domain names within the last few weeks. As noted by MacRumors, the company purchased three top-level domain names in December including apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto, through sponsored registrar MarkMonitor.
* The acquisitions only posted on Whois this morning, and they aren’t active yet, but given the ongoing chatter regarding Apple’s secret car project, they do arouse curiosity. There’s certainly a precedent of the firm purchasing domain names for rumored projects: iCloud and iPhone 4.
* There are a few theories here. The boring version is that Apple plans to use the domains to market its CarPlay product. Launched in 2014, CarPlay allows auto-makers to embed deep iPhone integration in their infotainment systems. The project has really been picking up steam lately.
* More exciting, though, is that the domains are possibly being set aside for Project Titan. Apple has put together a team of high profile engineers and executives from the auto industry, and rumor has it that they are working on an autonomous, electric car, with plans to launch by 2020.
