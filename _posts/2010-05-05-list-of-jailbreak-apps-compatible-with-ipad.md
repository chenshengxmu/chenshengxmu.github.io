title: List of Jailbreak Apps Compatible with the iPad
---
* Spirit brought us the easiest and fastest jailbreak ever. Great! The only problem is that most of these jailbreak apps aren’t compatible with the iPad just yet.
* Some smart dude got the idea to create an editable list of jailbreak apps that work on the iPad. The list is on Google Docs so anyone can edit it. I’m not sure who started this but it sure is a good idea.
* So far, about 70 apps have been tested, with more to come. You can find the list here. If you have tested a few jailbreak apps on your iPad, try to report the results by adding them to the list.
