* There are lots of reasons why you might invest in a USB Type-C cable for the new Apple TV. One of the most compelling reasons is because a USB Type-C cable allows you to record Apple TV video output. Via QuickTime’s video capturing capabilities, first introduced in OS X Yosemite, it’s possible to record and save direct-feed footage from the Apple TV to your Mac.

* Step 1: Connect your Apple TV to your Mac using a USB Type-C cable
* Step 2: Launch QuickTime
* Step 3: Click File → New Movie Recording
* Step 4: Click the dropdown menu next to the record button and select Apple TV for Camera and for Microphone

* Step 5: Click the Record button to start recording
* Step 6: Once you’re finished recording, click the Stop button
* Step 7: Click File → Save to save your recording
* Keep in mind that you will not be able to record HDCP protected content, which is used on some video streaming apps. You will, however, be able to capture direct-feed footage from games and the Apple TV interface itself.
* I’ve used QuickTime’s video capture capabilities in many of our Apple TV tutorials thus far, and it’s come in really handy.
* Do you own a USB Type-C cable yet? If not, is this enough to convince you to invest in one?
