* It’s a staggered release so you might need to wait a little bit longer if it’s not live on your local App Store yet. Here’s everything new in Pokémon GO 1.27.2 for iOS.
* Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile and a bunch of other Pokémon are now available in the game. All told, you now have the opportunity to catch more than 80 Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region in the Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver games.
* They’ve implemented a bunch of other enhancements, too, including new evolutions, berries and avatars, a new Encounter gameplay mode and an expanded wardrobe.
* Here’s the full changelog:
* Niantic promised to release another update soon bringing some of the missing features that didn’t make it into the initial release, like trading and real-time player battles.
* Pokémon GO is a free download from App Store.
