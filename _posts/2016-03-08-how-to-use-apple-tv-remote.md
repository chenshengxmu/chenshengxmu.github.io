* The Siri Remote is capable of so much more than help you move around the Apple TV’s Home screen.
* Its physical buttons, built-in sensors, mic and Bluetooth networking, along with programmable features accessible through the Settings app, let you control media playback with precision, converse with Siri, restart your set-top box, adjust your TV volume, launch and force-quit apps and much more.
* In this tutorial, you’ll learn not only the basics of using the Siri Remote to navigate apps and settings on your Apple TV, but also the secrets to unlocking its full potential and use it in not-so-obvious ways.
* The Siri Remote has five buttons: Menu, Home, Siri, Play/Pause and Volume Up/Down—and a smooth Touch surface that recognizes swipes and gestures. When you click the Touch surface, it makes a clicking sound and selects the highlighted item.
* At the Touch surface’s top is a hole for the built-in microphone. An additional mic hole is on the back for suppressing background noises so Siri can hear your more clearly.

* On the inside, the remote packs in an infrared transmitter to control the volume of your TV or other home theater devices, Bluetooth 4.0 to talk to your Apple TV and has accelerometer and gyroscope sensors for tilt-based controls in games.
* A Lightning port at the bottom is used to charge a built-in battery.
* Your Siri Remote comes automatically paired to its Apple TV.
* Should you need to manually initiate the pairing process—for instance, if the remote disconnects or you get a replacement unit—point it at the Apple TV’s front and hold the Play/Pause button and the Volume Up button for two seconds.
* An on-screen message appears when the remote is successfully paired.
* To charge the Siri Remote, connect one end of a Lightning cable to the Lightning port on the remote’s bottom and the other end to a USB port on your Mac or power adapter.

* According to Apple, your Siri Remote provides months of use on one charge with typical daily usage. Its 410 mAh lithium-ion battery takes about three hours to fully charge and you can continue using the remote while it charges.
* To remaining battery life is shown after selecting your remote in Settings → Remotes and Devices →  Bluetooth.

* Use soft, lint-free cloth or microfiber cloth to clean the Siri Remote.
* Avoid spraying Windex, rubbing alcohol and other solvents onto the accessory as those chemicals will dissolve the oleophobic coating on the Touch surface and may penetrate the microphone or Lightning port and damage the internals.
* The best way of getting rid of the dirt on the remote is to spray a piece of soft cloth with some water rather than the device itself, which could cause water to run along miniature cracks and work its way into the hardware.
* Avoid using towels with lints, paper towels and bathroom tissue because these materials have pretty rough surfaces that may scratch the remote.
* Your Siri Remote is a great controller in games that support tilt-based controls.
* Thanks to its accelerometer and gyroscope sensor, games respond to movements you make in the air with the remote. Some games require you to hold the remote in either horizontal or vertical orientation while others support both modes of operation.

* If you play a lot of games on your Apple TV, do yourself a favor and buy a Remote Loop to secure the Siri Remote and prevent it from flying across the room.
* You can swipe left, right, up and down on the Siri Remote’s Touch surface to navigate the entirety of the tvOS user interface:

* To make on-screen selections easier to spot, enable tvOS’s high-contrast cursor in General → Accessibility → Increase Contrast → Focus Style.
* By the way, you can adjust sensitivity of the Siri Remote’s Touch surface to your liking in Settings → Remotes and Devices → Touch Surface Tracking.
* Pecking away on the Apple TV’s software keyboard is not fun.
* Whenever the two-line keyboard pops up, swipe with your thumb on the Touch surface to select a letter and click it to type the character. However, you can also tap left/right on the Touch surface to move the selection cursor across the keyboard one character at a time.

* Tip: Entering text on your Apple TV is far easier with the free Remote iOS app
* TV sets, receivers and other home theater devices that support the HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (HDMI-CEC) standard, as well as those stuck with legacy infrared controls, can be controlled with the Volume Up and Down buttons on the Siri Remote.
* If your TV supports HDMI-CEC, go to Settings → Remotes and Devices, select Volume Control under the Home Theater Control heading and then choose the Auto or TV via IR option.
* Non-HDMI-CEC compliant devices must be programed to work with the Siri Remote by going to Settings → Remotes and Devices → Volume Control → Learn New Device and following on-screen instructions.

* After you enable HDMI-CEC integration, or teach your Siri Remote your infrared remote’s tricks, you can adjust the volume levels of your TV and other home theater equipment by clicking the Volume Up and Down buttons on the Siri Remote.
* Make sure there are no obstacles between the remote and your telly or otherwise your TV won’t register volume key presses.

* Your Apple TV can automatically turn on the connected TV set or receiver, and switch to the correct HDMI input, right after it wakes from sleep. To turn on this feature, enable the Turn On Your TV with Your Remote option under the Home Theater Control heading in Settings → Remotes and Devices.
* Now your telly or receiver automatically shuts down after you put the Apple TV to bed, and turns on when you wake the Apple TV from sleep.
* Your Apple TV runs a special version of iOS, called tvOS. Now, the tvOS operating system includes an iPhone-like app switcher which permits you to switch between running apps and force-quit individual apps on a whim.

* You can ask Siri to check the weather and sports scores, search for movies across multiple apps at once, search for songs and albums if you’re subscribed to Apple Music and more. For some results, you can swipe up on the Touch surface to reveal more information. For instance, swiping up may show more detailed weather forecast or sport scores.
* To launch an app using your voice, click and hold the Siri button and speak an app’s name or say “Open [APP NAME]” if you have multiple apps with similar names. If you simply say aloud an app’s name, like “YouTube,” and Siri is unsure which one she should open, you’ll be presented with multiple matches to choose from.
* Other verbal forms are supported, too: you can ask Siri to “Go to Photos”, “Open the App Store”, “Open Settings”, “Watch Hulu” and more, and she’ll do the right thing.
