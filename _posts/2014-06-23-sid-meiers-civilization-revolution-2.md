* Sid Meier’s Civilization Revolution 2, a mobile-exclusive sequel to the original Civilization game, is coming early next month to iOS devices, publishing label 2K Games and developer Fireaxis announced Monday.
* The game has been designed from the ground up for mobile devices, unlike the current Civilization Revolution which is basically an iOS (and console) port of the 2008 PC original.
* Revolution 2 is slated to launch on July 2 and we’ll make sure to tell you all about it as soon as it hits the App Store…
* The game files as the first title in the Civilization franchise to be developed exclusively for mobile platforms, 2K Games said.
* Some of the headline features tout high-impact graphics and new gameplay and controls that capitalize on the mobile technology advancements since the original Revolution launched more than five years ago.
