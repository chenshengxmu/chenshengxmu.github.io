* With presumably a couple months or so until the iPad 3 hits the shelves, I think we are way overdue for some good old rumors about Apple’s upcoming tablet.
* Today’s rumor is brought to you courtesy of BGR, who apparently got their hands on some images from a source claiming to be in possession of an iPad 3. If I haven’t lost you yet, then keep on reading because there seems to be some good sense to all this…
* The photos published by BGR contain data from iBoot, a debug tool used for development. These images show several details about what might very well be the iPad 3.
* First, these J1 and J2 model numbers that DigiTimes uncovered a few weeks ago are showing up again. While DigiTimes assumed they were two different devices, BGR believes it’s actually the same device. One wi-fi only version, and one with GSM/CDMA/LTE.
* Additionally, the leaked screenshots show what could be a quad-core A6 processor, model number S5L8945X. In comparison, A4 model number was S5L8930X, while the A5 was S5L8940X.
* Obviously, and until Apple unveils the iPad 3, these are just rumors and should always be taken with a grain of salt, though all this info uncovered by BGR does make sense to me.
* What do you think?
