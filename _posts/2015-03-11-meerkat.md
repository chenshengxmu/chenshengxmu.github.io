* During Apple’s Spring Forward event, you may have noticed a few tweets that started off with “|LIVE NOW|” followed by a hashtag for “meerkat” and a link. If you haven’t had a chance to experience it yet, the Twitter verse now has a way to live stream video content.
* Meerkat is a video client that allows users to live stream video directly to their followers on Twitter. It is live. If you click on the link after the video has ended, you will miss out.
* After you log in with your Twitter credentials, you can start a live stream immediately or schedule one for a later time. Your followers will be able to watch the live stream in real time, but after the moment has passed, so has their ability to see the video.

* Your followers can re-stream your live feed to their followers. But again, if they miss it, they will not be able to access it again at a later time.
* You can also schedule a live stream. Start by entering text that lets users know you will be live streaming at a specific time. Then, set the time schedule. Your followers will all know that a live stream will take place later and be online and ready to watch.
* Anyone can watch it on the web, too. You don’t have to have Meerkat to experience the live stream event. You do have to allow Meerkat to access your Twitter account in order to view live streaming content, but you don’t have to sign up for anything.
* I watched some of Apple’s Spring Forward event via Meerkat when it first started, which was nice because the official live stream was a bit late getting started.

* You can follow other Meerkat users from within the app and also see which Twitter users you follow or follow you that also use the app.
* Meerkat is available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for free. It requires a Twitter account to send a live stream. Download it in the App Store today.
