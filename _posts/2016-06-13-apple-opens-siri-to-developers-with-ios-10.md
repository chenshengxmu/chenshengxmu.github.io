* iOS 10, which was unveiled at Apple’s WWDC 2016 Keynote on Monday, will provide users with the most in-depth Siri experience of any iOS release in history.
* Apple is officially opening Siri up with an API that will let developers tap into Siri for their App Store apps.
* For the longest time, Siri has been limited to what Apple wanted to allow it to do, but now, users will get a very flexible voice platform that can be extended as far as a developer’s mind can take it.
* With a powerful new API dubbed SiriKit, developers can now integrate features of their app with Siri in the upcoming iOS 10 release, allowing users to make queries related to third-party apps.
* Provided in a Keynote example, Apple’s Craig Federighi showed to the audience how Siri in iOS 10 could be used to send a WeChat message. WeChat obviously won’t be the only app to jump on board with third-party Siri support, but its popularity is worth mentioning.
* Apple’s website also shows off what appears to be integration with Lyft, an app that lets you hitch a ride, and details a future where you could send money to someone through the third-party Square payment app.

* With these new SiriKit APIs, Apple will no longer have to use engineer manpower to build third-party services like Shazam, Wolfram Alpha, and Yelp into Siri, and they can let third-party developers tap into the platform themselves.
* The move opens an infinite number of doors, but there will of course be rules and regulations that will limit app developers to what they can and cannot do.
* With a more flexible platform, users may actually find Siri to be more useful; especially those that like using third-party apps over Apple’s built-in software.
* What apps are you excited to use Siri with when iOS 10 launches this Fall? Share in the comments below!
