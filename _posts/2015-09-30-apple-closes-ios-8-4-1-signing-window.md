* Today’s brisk activity has come to an end with the closure of the iOS 8.4.1 and iOS 9.0 signing window. This means that users can no longer upgrade or downgrade to iOS 8.4.1 or iOS 9.
* This is big news, because an iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak has been rumored to be in the works. If you didn’t heed our advice about updating or downgrading to iOS 8.4.1, then it’s too late to do so now.
* As we always state, it’s a good idea to keep tabs on IPSW.me for the latest info on firmware signing windows. For example, check IPSW.me/9.0.1 to keep an eye on the iOS 9.0.1 window.
* What we can say for sure is that the last vestige of iOS 8 is now a thing of the past. On to iOS 9!
