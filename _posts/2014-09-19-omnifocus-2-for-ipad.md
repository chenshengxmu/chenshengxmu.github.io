* OmniFocus is probably the most comprehensive getting things done (GTD) app available on the iPhone. It makes project management easy and convenient, helps keep you organized and on task, and makes it possible for you to schedule your busy life.
* Finally, OmniFocus 2 is now available on the iPad as a new download. It has a completely redesigned user interface that takes advantage of the larger screen. It combines all of the best features of OmniFocus 2 for Mac and OmniFocus 2 for iPhone into one great app on the iPad.
* The app features productivity widgets that you can see under the “Today” portion of Notification Center. So you can see what needs to be done at a glance without even having to open the app. If you’ve completed a task, you can tap on the item in Notification Center to check it off. It is also compatible with iOS 8 extensions so you can send items to OmniFocus while in another app without having to switch.

* This iPad version is designed with an optimum user interface that is perfect for the larger screen. You can keep your to-do lists in different folders and categorize them by projects. You can assign tasks to different people and even identify location-based items.
* You can customize and edit the estimated time frame for a specific project, adjust the view to see results from your whole database, or just the current window, and add photo and audio attachments that are synced from other devices. Review mode lets you check on the status of a project without taking up too much time.

* With iOS 8, you can ask Siri to perform actions inside the app. If you have your iPad plugged in, you can even activate the “Hey Siri” feature. If you need to remember to pick something up on the way home, set a location based notification with a proximity range so you will remember to take the next exit before passing the store. You can also export items from your iPad to an email as plain text, HTML, and CVS files.
* The Pro version gives you even more features, including Custom Perspectives, which allows you to set what view you’d like to see. You can create multiple custom perspectives and switch between them whenever you like. The Customizable Sidebar lets you reorder projects, modify views, and edit your Custom Perspectives. If you have the Mac version, you can sync your preexisting Custom Perspectives on your iPad.
