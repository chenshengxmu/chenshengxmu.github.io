* Apple is having issues manufacturing the 1.5-inch AMOLED screen for the Apple Watch, and as a result, has cut initial production and shipment targets in half, according to UDN Mobile.
* Citing sources in Apple’s supply chain, the Taiwanese publication says Apple has cut shipments from between 2.5 to 3 million units to between 1.25 and 1.5 million units. 
* The Apple Watch marks the first of Apple’s devices sporting an AMOLED display. It’s used LCD displays for the iPhone line. It may make a bit of sense why Apple is running into issues with AMOLED, as it’s essentially hit the ground running.
* Digital Trends published a nice comparison of AMOLED vs LCD. The main achievement of AMOLED is you’re able to create a screen that is just as bright as normal screens with one third the amount of sub pixels – which makes sense for such a small display.
* While polls and analyst data don’t always prove to be accurate, early data has seen demand for the Apple Watch will be strong. If the production cuts described by UDN Mobile on Monday are indeed true, customers may have trouble ordering the Apple Watch initially.
* All three editions of the Apple Watch will launch on April 24, varying in pricing, with preorders and in-store demos starting on April 10.
