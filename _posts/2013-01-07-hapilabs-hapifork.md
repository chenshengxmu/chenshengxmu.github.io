* We already have smart TVs (Samsung leads the charge), as well as smart ovens, smart laundry and smart vacuum (all coming from LG in 2013). Heck, we’re increasingly wearing app-enabled smart watches around our wrist (we’re looking at you, Apple). It really is no surprise then that gadget makers now expect we’ll monitor our eating habits using a ‘smart’ fork?
* Enter the Hapifork from Hapilabs, an unusual app-enabled accessory coming this Spring to “greatly improve your digestion”, up to the point where “you’ll likely start losing weight”. I’m not entirely convinced science exists to back that claim…
* Okay, so it has in-built sensors that monitor the fork’s movement from plate to mouth to measure how long it took to eat your meal, the amount of so-called ‘fork servings’ taken per minute and intervals between fork servings.
* The pitch basically comes down to this: should you eat your lunch too fast, the gadget will vibrate.
* But what’s too fast, you ask?
* According to the company, if there are fewer than ten seconds between forkfuls, the Hapifork kicks into action.
* Of course Hapiforks come in happy colors, did you think otherwise?

* Now, you’ll be initially required to manually download your dining data to a computer after each meal, but a Bluetooth version is in the works, a spokesperson has confirmed.
* Your data also gets uploaded to an online dashboard and there’s a coaching program designed to help you change your eating behavior.

* Eating too fast is a leading cause of weight gain, says Hapilabs and points out that an accompanying iOS and Android app should help develop healthier eating habits over time.
* Your stomach needs 20 min to tell your brain you’ve eaten enough. Will a “smart” fork help you eat less?on.mktw.net/118Awmc #2013CES

* Would-be slow eaters can check out the Hapifork now over at the Hapilabs web store.
* Here’s a nice hands-on video by The Verge.
* The ultimate gadget for the ultimate epicurean geek retails for a rather pricey hundred bucks and is available in the USB and Bluetooth flavor, the former shipping during Q2 and the latter arriving some time in Q3 2013.
* According to a 2011 study in The Journal of Nutrition, no definite proof exists that people who eat their dinner more slowly also reduce their habit of grabbing a snack shortly after the meal.
* The Hapifork is nice, but what if you like finger food?
