title: 'Plugication' makes its way to Cydia
---
* Plugication — the jailbreak tweak that automatically resumes music upon connecting your headphones to your device — has been officially released to the public.
* Our preview covered Plugication’s main feature, but a version is also in the works that will allow users to disable the “pause on disconnect” feature that happens when you remove headphones.
* Plugication can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s ModMyi repo. Be sure to share your thoughts after giving it a try.
