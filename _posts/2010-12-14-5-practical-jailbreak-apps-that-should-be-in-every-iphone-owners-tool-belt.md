* We here at iDB love us some good jailbreak apps and tweaks, but there are few that stand out when you take into account sheer practicality.
* For example, say you’re trying to find your keys in a dark place, or need to know where to position the jumper cables on your stalled car during the cold the night hours? No sweat, you always have a flashlight with you; thanks to your iPhone and SpringFlash.
* Did your favorite app make the cut? Are you totally prepared for whatever situation may confront you in a dire time of need? Are we making this way too suspenseful? Check inside and find the answer…

* For someone who has been suffering through Proximity Sensor issues, I can’t tell you how much of a blessing CallLock is. No more accidentally hanging up on friends and family, and no longer placing them on hold, while unbeknownst to me, I continue rambling to no one.
* It’s not perfect, but it is a solution, and it does work. So, the next time that recruiter calls you back about a job interview, no worries about hanging up on them in mid conversation. Now how practical is that?
* Price: $0.99

* If you live in a part of the world that experiences treacherous winter weather, then WeatherIcon can be a great tool to have in your iPhone tool belt. Not only does it keep you updated on the latest weather, right on your homescreen, it nicely integrates with the stock weather app.
* This makes WeatherIcon feel like a native iPhone feature, which is quite the compliment. It’s also really handy because it’s always staring at you; there’s no way you’ll forget that pair of gloves this time!
* Price: Free

* If you own an iPhone 4 and SpringFlash, it makes for a great flashlight that’s always with you. Instead of using the screen’s LED backlight, SpringFlash uses the iPhone 4’s LED flash, which makes for a much more practical flashlight.
* There are other jailbreak solutions that offer a flashlight, but SpringFlash is free and it’s easily accessible via an SBSettings toggle, even if your screen is locked.
* Price: Free

* At the drop of a hat, some of the entertainment that sits on your iPhone can be played back on your television thanks to AirPlay. But AirPlay video is restricted to the YouTube app, making it a lot less useful than we would have hoped. Thankfully, AirVideoEnabler allows you to bypass those silly restrictions.
* The result is an incredibly practical jailbreak solution that turns any home with an Apple TV and an iPhone, into a potential night at the movies.
* Price: Free

* Surprise, Surprise, it’s MyWi. Never leave home without it.
* MyWi gives you the ability to create a WiFi hotspot at any time, on a whim. Internet access, for any device, at any time? It’s hard to come up with a more practical app than that, especially if you’re hanging on to an unlimited data plan.
* Price: $19.99 w/Free Trial
* What do you think? Do you have these essential apps in your iPhone tool belt?
