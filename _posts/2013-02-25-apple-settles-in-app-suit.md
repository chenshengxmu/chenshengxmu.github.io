* Apple today has agreed to settle a nearly two year-old lawsuit with a group of parents over unauthorized in-app purchases made by their kids. The parents complained that the process’ lack of password requirement led to massive iTunes bills.
* As part of the preliminary deal, which has yet to be finalized by a judge, Apple will pay eligible class members with a $5 iTunes gift card or the same amount in cash. And for those users who spent more than $30, it’s offering a full refund… 
* Here’s a look back at the original complaint:
* “Garen Meguerian let his 9-year-old daughter download several free games from the App Store. Several weeks later, he discovered his daughter had purchased approximately $200 of virtual currency like Zombie Toxin and City Cash. Meguerian is suing Apple for damages plus attorney fees.”
* Several parents would later join the complaint, including one father whose son racked up a $1200 iTunes bill after purchasing several wagons of ‘virtual smurf berries’ at $99 a pop. This, of course, was before Apple released its iOS 4.3 update.
* Prior to iOS 4.3, the App Store would give users a 15-minute window after password authentication to freely make in-app purchases. It was meant to streamline the experience, but after receiving complaints from angry parents, it changed it.
* For the proposed settlement (via GigaOm), Apple will be required to send notices to more than 23 million iTunes account holders who bought something in-game from one of of the “qualified apps.” But it’s not known how many were actually affected.
* The deal still needs approval from a federal judge. When that occurs, the notification period will begin and Apple will begin accepting claims. After the claims are in, a judge will approve the final settlement and Apple will begin making payments.
