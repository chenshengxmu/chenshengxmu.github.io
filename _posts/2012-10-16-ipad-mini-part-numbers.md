* iDB yesterday informed you about possible price points for the iPad mini discovered in the system of a German retailer. Today, we bring you a full list of alleged iPad mini part numbers, showing 24 different models based on price, color and storage capacity. Most telling of all, it appears Apple will offer the device in WiFi, 3G and 4G LTE configurations…
* These part numbers published by AppleInsider suggest four stock-keeping units (SKU) that likely represent four storage capacities. From the leaked price list mentioned earlier we can safely assume that the iPad mini will come in 8, 16, 32 and 64 gigabyte varieties, labeled as P101, P103, P105 and P107.
* Each storage option will be available in two colors (likely black & slate and satin & silver, just like the iPhone 5), each in WiFi-only and WiFi + Cellular options, amounting to a total of 24 different SKUs.

* Also, this:
* Each of the four different product descriptions also come with three different distinctions: “GOOD,” “BETTER,” and “BEST,” which could signify Wi-Fi-only, 3G, and 4G LTE models, respectively. Each model is also available in “A” and “B” variants, which likely identify color options of black and white.
* Unfortunately, the list reveals nothing in way of possible prices. The blogosphere thinks the entry-level 8GB WiFi iPad mini will start at either $199 or $249, a $50 premium over Google’s 8GB Nexus 7 tablet.
* All will be known next Tuesday, when Apple is believed to be holding a media event to launch the smaller iPad, in addition to new iMacs, Mac minis and a 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. The AppleInsider report states that Apple will begin selling new iMacs a day after the keynote.
* In the meantime, Microsoft has released a teaser ad for its upcoming Surface tablet, scheduled to hit Microsoft Stores on October 26 alongside Windows 8. The Surface should start at $499 for the entry-level model with 32 gigabytes of storage.
* At any rate, October 23 can’t come soon enough.
