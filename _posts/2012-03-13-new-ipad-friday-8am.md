* As expected, the new iPad will be available for sale at your local Apple Store this Friday, at 8am. The confirmation comes from 9to5Mac‘s Mark Gurman who managed to get a photo of one of the marketing materials that will be hanging on the windows of Apple Stores around the country this Friday.
* If the date doesn’t come as a surprise – it was officially announced by Apple last week – the time was kind of an X factor until now…
* For those of you who don’t like to get in line for hours, Apple has made the new iPad available for pre-order since last Wednesday. However, facing huge demand, shipping times are already slipping and if you pre-order your iPad today, you definitely won’t be able to get it by the 16th.
* I am expecting mine to be delivered by FedEx before 3pm on Friday. What about you? Will you be getting the line, or have you already pre-ordered?
