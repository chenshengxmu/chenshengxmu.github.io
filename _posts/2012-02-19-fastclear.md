* Does tapping twice to clear Notification Center notifications get on your nerves? Well, if you haven’t used one of the many already available tweaks to eliminate the issue, perhaps FastClear is what you need?
* FastClear is a simple tweak that makes the “clear” dialogue display on Notification Center instead of the “x”. This enables you to clear all of your notifications with a single tap instead of two…
* As stated, there are tweaks that have been available on Cydia for quite some time that have this functionality; Springtomize 2 comes to mind. But if you’re looking for a singular tweak with a focused purpose that’s free, then it’s hard to do wrong with FastClear — it just works.
* Head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo if your iOS 5 device is jailbroken and you’re anxious to take it for a spin.
* What do you think?
