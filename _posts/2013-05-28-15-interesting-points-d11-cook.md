* Earlier this evening, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook took the stage at AllThingsD’s D11 conference to talk about all things Apple. Cook rarely does interviews, but he looked like a pro fielding questions from tech veterans Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher.
* Over the course of the hour-long talk, the trio discussed a wide range of fascinating topics including iWatch rumors, iOS 7 and Android’s growing marketshare. And as usual, we’ve combed through it all to bring you the 15 most interesting points…
* While Cook didn’t really reveal anything new tonight, he did answer a lot of questions more candidly than I would’ve thought he would. For example, when he confirmed that Jony Ive was working on iOS 7, or gave specific number of acquisitions.
* If nothing else, his comments have increased my anticipation for WWDC next month, and Apple’s expected fall media event(s). The iPad-maker hasn’t announced a new product or service yet this year, so the pre-holiday quarter is shaping up to be huge.
* What are your thoughts on Cook’s interview tonight?
