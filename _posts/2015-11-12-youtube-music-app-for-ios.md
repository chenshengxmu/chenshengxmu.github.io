* YouTube on Thursday released a new mobile app called YouTube Music. The app lets you watch and listen to a nearly endless catalog of music, and you can use it for free, with ads of course. The ads go away and you get more features if you sign up for YouTube’s recently-launched Red service for $10/month.
* So what does it look like? Well searching any video, album or artist in YouTube Music starts a personalized radio station. From there you can check out recommended tracks, trending music, top 40 hits, and up-and-coming artists. There’s also a lot of video content here, such as music videos, concert footage, etc.
* Usher discovers Bieber. Psy breaks a billion. Macklemore goes from the garage to the Grammys. Pentatonix top the charts. Over the past ten years, music on YouTube has been magic. We’ve seen established artists reach new heights and new artists explode on the scene. We’ve seen our fans shake, get happy and let it go. And together, they’ve made YouTube the absolute best place in the world to discover new music.
* […] But we want to do even more to support artists and all the fans who turn to YouTube to discover music, so we’re making the experience even better with a brand new YouTube Music app. With YouTube Music, you’ll get a completely new type of experience, designed to make discovering music on YouTube easier than ever.
* Again, you’ll get access to most of the service for free, but folks with YouTube Red subscriptions will get ad-free videos, offline listening on mobile devices, background audio, and the ability to listen to music without video. The price is $9.99/month (or $12.99/month via the App Store), and there’s a 14-day free trial.
* You can find the new YouTube Music app in the App Store for free.
