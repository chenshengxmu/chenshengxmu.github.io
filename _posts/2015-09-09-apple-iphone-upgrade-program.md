* Alongside its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Apple on Wednesday announced the iPhone Upgrade Program. Itâ€™s an in-house upgrade program, similar to the installment plans carriers offer, which allows you to get a new iPhone every year for a monthly fee.
* The program, which will only be available in US Apple retail stores at launch, will come unlocked, so you can choose your own carrier, and include AppleCare+ support. The price will start at $32 per month, and go up depending on the model you pick.
* As we said in our previous post, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be available for pre-order beginning Saturday, September 12, and will begin shipping and hitting store shelves on Friday, September 25.
