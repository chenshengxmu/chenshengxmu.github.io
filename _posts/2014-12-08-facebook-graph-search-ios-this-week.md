* Facebook on Monday confirmed that it’s at last gearing up to launch Graph Search in its mobile application for the iPhone and iPad this week following what has turned to be an incredibly extensive period of testing.
* Tapping Facebook’s vast database, Graph Search uses natural language queries to surface content information from within a user’s network of friends that would be impractical or impossible using the standard and fairly limited search feature.
* Another way to describe Open Graph: this tremendously powerful tool makes it easy and fun to explore the world through the eyes of your friends.
* “Today we’re updating Facebook Search to make it easier to find the posts that have been shared with you,” said the social networking giant. The featured will roll out this week in US English on the iPhone and desktop, Facebook confirmed.
* It’s pretty straightforward: tap on the search bar in the iOS app, start typing and watch as Graph Search does its magic. To unravel the full potential of the feature, use natural language queries (i.e. “My friends who live in New York) to limit your search to specific friends, lists, locations, timelines and other things.
* Your search results are personalized and unique to you.

* “With a quick search, you can get back to a fun video from your graduation, a news article you’ve been meaning to read, or photos from your friend’s wedding last summer,” boasts Facebook.
* Introduced in January of 2013 on desktop, Graph Search cam resurface old content like posts, status updates, photo captions, Notes, check-ins and more by keywords, using natural language queries.

* Open Graph is powerful, no question about it.
* To think you can crawl all of Facebook’s data and 1.4 billion accounts with queries like “my friends who like Japanese food,” “Posts I commented on,” “Photos posted at LEX,” “Posts about Breaking Bad by my friends,” “Posts by my family about dogs” and more boggles my mind.
* Privacy advocates needn’t worry: your private posts from friends and those you are not allowed to see won’t pop up in search results.

* Bloomberg first caught glimpses of Graph Search on mobile in August.
* The feature was being tested with a limited number of users it would seem and today Facebook confirmed it’s ready for prime time. And it was about the time, if I may add.

* Facebook’s main iOS client has been bumped to version 20.0 earlier this morning to bring your the aforementioned Open Graph goodies and improvements.
* Facebook for iOS is available free in the App Store.
* Are you looking forward to using Graph Search on your iPhone?
