* Sure, Apple may have released Siri without all of the functionality that we’d like. But luckily, for those of us who are jailbroken, Cydia has a plethora of tweaks and add-ons available that make the digital assistant much more capable.
* Such is the case with SiriSports. The new tweak, developed by Evan Coleman, adds the ability to look up sport scores and game times for your favorite professional team in the MLB, NBA, and NHL using Siri-flavored voice commands…
* Once installed, you’ll notice that there aren’t many settings to configure. All you have to do is go into your Settings app, and into the SiriSports pane, and make sure that everything is enabled. The rest is just figuring out what to say.
* For example, “NBA scores help” brings up a list of voice commands for looking up NBA information such as “who’s winning the Mavericks game?” and “did the Bulls win last night?” Obviously the same goes for the MLB and NHL as well.
* I have to say that I’m quite impressed with this tweak. Its list of abilities is extensive and answers are returned quickly and accurately. If you love sports this is a must have. And best of all, it’s free. You can find SiriSports in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think of this Siri tweak?
