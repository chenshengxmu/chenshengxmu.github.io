* Five days ago, iDownloadBlog’s own Andrew O’Hara first wrote about jailbreak developer Andy Wiik‘s discovery of Dark Mode resources buried deep within iOS 10’s Messages app.
* During the weekend, Wiik shared a few new screenshots showing a dark mode for the Settings app, running in iOS Simulator, strongly suggesting that these Dark Mode resources may not have been left within iOS 10 code by accident.
* Although Apple did add a dark interface mode to tvOS 10 for the fourth-generation Apple TV, this sought-after feature remains officially unavailable in iOS 10.
* As I said recently, Apple’s been experimenting with dark iOS interfaces for years now.
* The iBooks app includes an automatic dark mode, for example. Safari’s Reader Mode lets you pick a background color, one of which is black, and the iTunes Store app has had black interfaces for TV Shows and Movies for years now.
* In iOS 10, the Clock app has been given an all-dark treatment, as show below.

* All of this is fueling speculation that Apple is laying the groundwork for Dark Mode that some folks think will officially launch alongside OLED iPhones this or next year.
* In all likelihood, Dark Mode won’t officially debut until iOS 11.
* Because OLED technology lights up individual pixels and doesn’t require backlighting, dark interfaces actually help reduce a display’s power consumption.
* This is why the Apple Watch’s interface is mostly dark.
* With the traditional LCD technology, backlighting is required whether or not the entire screen is all black. As a consequence, a dark interface on an LCD display doesn’t really make sense from an energy standpoint.
