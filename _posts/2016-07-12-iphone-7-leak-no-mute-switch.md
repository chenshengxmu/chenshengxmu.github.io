* The industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack may not be the only widely-used feature that is thought to be on the chopping block for the next iPhone. A new batch of high-resolution photographs that surfaced last evening appear to show off a larger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model that doesn’t seem to have the Mute switch on its side.
* The photos were posted by French bog NowhereElse. The same publication released a set of images yesterday that gave us the clearest look yet at the iPhone 7’s subdued antenna lines.
* The site obtained these new shots from the same trusted Chinese source.
* As you can see for yourself, the photos show what looks like a Smart Connector on the handset’s back, fueling rumors that the flagship iPhone 7 Plus model may include other exclusive features beyond a dual-lens camera.
* The Smart Connector could be used not only for magnetically attaching certain peripherals to the iPhone 7 Plus, but also for wireless charging—another feature said to be exclusive to the 5.5-inch handset.
* These dummy iPhone 7 Plus cases also show a dual-lens camera system on the back, in line with prior rumors. One of the photos appears to show off a fully assembled 4.7-inch device. Note that lack of branding is normal for pre-production parts.

* The Power/Sleep button and Volume Up and Down buttons are still present on the sides of the case. Curiously enough, one of the images clearly depicts a clickable Home button rather than its digital, non-moving variant that the rumor-mill said would presumably lay flush with the front face of the phone.
* What do you make of the possible removal of the Mute Switch from the iPhone 7 Plus?
