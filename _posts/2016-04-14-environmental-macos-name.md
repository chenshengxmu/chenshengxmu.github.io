* More evidence that Apple is planning to rebrand OS X to MacOS in the near future has been discovered on Apple’s environmental webpage. First spotted by 9to5Mac, the recently updated page specifically refers to “MacOS” devices.
* The news follows a March report that pointed to a MacOS reference hidden inside OS X code. And of course the change has long been speculated about, as it would bring the desktop OS branding in line with Apple’s other platforms.
* Here’s the latest reference, which you can find on Apple’s Environment – Answers page, in the “How does Apple conduct its Product Greenhouse Gas Life Cycle Assessment?” section.
* To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. Years of use, which are based on first owners, are assumed to be four years for MacOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.
* While this appears to confirm the impending rebranding, we won’t know for sure until it happens. It does seem likely, though, that if Apple is going to rename OS X to MacOS, we’ll hear about it at the upcoming developer conference in June.
