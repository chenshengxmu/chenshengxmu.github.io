* As promised last week, Strata Networks, a regional U.S. wireless carrier, finally landed the iPhone 5 today. And, in emulating fellow rural telcos, Strata is offering Apple’s device with a $50 discount compared to the asking prices at Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. Specifically, the iPhone 5 is available for $149 for the 16GB model, $249 for the 32GB model and $349 for the high-end model with 64 gigabytes of storage. The iPhone 5 is available in all Strata stores in Utah, Colorado and Wyoming.
* They don’t mention web sales, though Strata did update its web site this morning to reflect the devices’ availability. The carrier is also selling the iPhone 4S for $49 and the iPhone 4 for free, with a qualifying contract. Would-be subscribers should be pleased to know that the iPhone 5 is compatible with Strata’s 4G LTE network that the company started deploying ahead of Christmas 2012…
* I called Strata HQ this morning and they confirmed the iPhone 5 is now available in their stores.
* The Roosevelt, Utah telco has 50,000 customers and operates a CDMA network so buyers will require an LTE SIM. Strata’s LTE covers local markets in Colorado and Idaho, including several counties in Utah and the Uintah Basin in Duchesne County.
* Plans stat at eighty bucks per month for 600 voice minutes, unlimited texting to any network and one gigabyte of data. For five bucks a month more, you get unlimited voice minutes and text messages.

* All prices entail a new 24-month contract.
