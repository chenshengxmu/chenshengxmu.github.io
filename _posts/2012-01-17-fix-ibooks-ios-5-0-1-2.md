* If your iPhone is jailbroken on iOS 5.0.1, and you use iBooks, chances are you’ve encountered the dreaded “Configuration Error”.
* No worries though, as both RedSn0w and Corona have been updated to remedy the issue.
* Inside, we’ll show you how to use the Corona package from the Chronic Dev Team to fix the iBooks issue on jailbroken 5.0.1 devices.
* Step 1: Install the latest version of Corona from Cydia.
* Step 2: Reboot your device.
* Step 3: Load iBooks.
* Alternatively, you could use our RedSn0w guide to re-jailbreak your device using the latest version of RedSn0w, and uncheck “install Cydia”. However, the above tutorial is by far the easiest method for fixing the iBooks issue.
* Was the fix successful for you?
