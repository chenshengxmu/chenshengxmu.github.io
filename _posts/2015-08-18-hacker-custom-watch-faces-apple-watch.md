* Hamza Sood, a well-known member of the jailbreak community who likes to dabble in code, just tweeted a video of an Apple Watch running a custom watch face. The video, which is 23 seconds long, shows a custom watch face with running on a stainless steel Apple Watch with Milanese loop. Check out the full video and tell us what you think.
* After some haxx… Custom watch faces on Apple Watch!
* Watch face source code is on GitHub:https://t.co/7ZvOz8nK34 pic.twitter.com/nQGJKlp6kt

* As you can see, Hamza has a custom watch face installed on his Apple Watch running watchOS 2 beta. The other watch face seen is an Apple internal tester. He’s also posted the source code for his on GitHub.
* As far as what exact methods he used to pull off loading the watch face on his Apple Watch, that’s the million dollar question…

* As mentioned, not only does the video show off a custom watch face, but he’s also made it so that the standard color customization feature shows two colors at once. The colors are then shown and blended together on the custom face.
* Impressive, indeed.
* Would you like to have custom watch faces on watchOS? Sound off in the comments below.
