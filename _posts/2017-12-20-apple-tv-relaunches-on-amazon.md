* With the recent release of Amazon’s Prime Video app on tvOS App Store, which has allegedly managed to break the record for first-week Apple TV downloads, Apple’s set-top box is now available to purchase from Amazon.com following a two-year block.
* Keeping true to its promise, the online retail giant has now resume selling the device.
* The fourth-generation 32GB Apple TV ($149), as well as the fifth-generation 32GB Apple TV 4K ($179) and 64GB Apple TV 4K ($199), are now available to purchase from Amazon.com. All listed models popped up overnight and appear to be sold directly by Amazon, not a third-party.
* All three models were temporarily out of sock at the time of this writing. You can add the devices to your shopping cart and checkout right now knowing your order will be delivered as soon as stock is available (no estimated delivery window was provided at post time).
* A listing for the 64-gigabyte version of Apple TV 4K reappeared on Amazon.com in September from a vendor claiming to be Apple. The item was out of stock right from the start and the listing soon disappeared from Amazon.com.
* Amazon removed media streamers like Apple TV and Chromecast from sale in 2015 due to lack of support for Prime Video content playback, which contributed to “customer confusion.”
