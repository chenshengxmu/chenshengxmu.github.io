* A new report is out tonight, claiming that Proview and Apple have finally reached a settlement in their ‘iPad’ trademark dispute. The two companies have been in and out of courtrooms for over a year, fighting over the moniker.
* The battle has seen Apple’s tablet barred from sales in a number of cities and provinces around mainland China. And Proview, an electronics manufacturer, was at one time reportedly seeking $1.5 billion in compensation…
* But they didn’t end up getting quite that much. The Associated Press is reporting that Apple has reached a settlement deal with Proview in the amount of $60 million:
* “Apple has agreed to pay a Chinese company $60 million to settle a dispute over ownership of the iPad name, a court announced Monday, removing a potential obstacle to sales of the popular tablet computer in the key Chinese market.
* “The iPad dispute is ended,” the Guangdong High People’s Court said in a statement. “Apple Inc. has transferred $60 million to the account of the Guangdong High Court as requested in the mediation letter.”
* Apple has maintained that it legally acquired the Chinese rights to the iPad trademark back in 2009, from Proview for $55,000. But Proview says that the subsidiary Apple purchased the rights from, never had the authority to sell them in the first place.
* At any rate, it looks like it’s over. Although $60 million is a lot more than Apple’s initial $16 million offer, it’s far less than what Proview was looking for. Word is the company was pressured by creditors into taking an early settlement, due to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
* What do you think? Is a $60 million settlement a win or a loss for Apple here?
