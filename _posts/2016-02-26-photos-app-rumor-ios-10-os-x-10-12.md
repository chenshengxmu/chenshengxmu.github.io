* A report yesterday by the fairly accurate Japanese blog Mac Otakara claims insider knowledge of an improved Photos app in Apple’s upcoming iOS 10 and OS X 10.12 operating system refreshes that, as per sources, should gain new features putting it on par with the discontinued iPhoto app.
* Apple was somewhat criticized for its decision to discontinue Aperture and iPhoto in favor of the new Photos app, which took almost a year to gain support for third-party image editing filter and effects on the Mac.
* Citing a reliable sources, Mac Otakara wasn’t able to provide specific information about an updated Photos app aside from mentioning that Photos for Mac will gain new features but still won’t be on par with Apple’s Aperture.
* As for Photos for iOS, the app should introduce a heal tool and let users edit EXIF metadata information embedded inside image files, both of which is possible in iPhone. Editing EXIF metadata in the current Photos app is not possible and requires using a third-party app like Metapho or EXIF-fi.
* All told, the report claims that with Photos for iOS 10 and OS X 10.12, Apple wants to achieve feature parity with iPhoto 9.6.1 for Mac and iPhoto 2.0.1 for iOS.
* iInternally code-named “Fuji,” OS X 10.12 is also expected to bring Siri to the Mac and pack in minor user interface tweaks across core system application windows.
