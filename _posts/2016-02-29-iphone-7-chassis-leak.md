* A batch of images have been leaked on the web by an Apple supplier, potentially giving us a look at a purported chassis for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7.
* Published by French blog NowhereElse.fr, which does due diligence before posting part leaks, the photos show what looks like a Unibody frame handled by a factory worker, resembling Apple’s design style for the iPhone 6/6s series.
* Reality checks, however, lead us to the conclusion that this likely is not a genuine iPhone 7 part, but a frame belonging to another handset.
* For starters, the rectangular frame that holds the screen assembly measures 5.2 inches diagonally and the current iPhone 6/6s series is provided in 4.7 and 5.5-inch flavors.
* Then there’s the placement of the headphone jack at the bottom. Didn’t the rumor mill assert that the iPhone 7 would ditch the headphone jack in favor of Lightning-based and wireless headphones?

* Also worth keeping in mind: the supplier in question has both Apple and Huawei as its clients so there’s a reasonably high likelihood that what we’re seeing here is a chassis for an unreleased Huawei device.
* It could even be an iPhone design that Apple had prototyped but ultimately abandoned.
* Last but not least, take note of the position of the volume buttons and the power switch and lack of a hole for the silent switch, as evidenced on the photos above which put the leaked metal frame against a protective shell designed for Huawei’s P9 smartphone.
* What do you think about the part shown on these pictures, is it a fluke or the real deal?
