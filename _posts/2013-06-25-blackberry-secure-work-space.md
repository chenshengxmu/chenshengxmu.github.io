* Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry today announced Secure Work Space, a new option for increased enterprise security on iOS and Android devices. Part of BlackBerry Enterprise Services 10, Secure Work Space extends BlackBerry security for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets without the need for a VPN infrastructure. Specifically, the option provides secure email, calendar, contacts and browser, as well as secure document management and work app deployment…
* According to a media release, the solution enables customers to separate work from personal data without having to rely on the pricey VPN infrastructures to access enterprise data behind corporate firewalls.
* BlackBerry provides security at the device, server and network level. Secure Work Space leverages the same trusted behind-the-firewall connection available for BlackBerry smartphones and extends BlackBerry security capabilities for data-at-rest and data-in-transit to iOS and Android devices.
* Customers can manage their Secure Work Space container through a single console in BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10. They have been trialing Secure Work Space globally since the January 2013 launch of BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 servers.

* BlackBerry has also teamed up app partners such as Box to provide business collaboration in the cloud. A free trial is available, with client access licenses for Secure Work Space starting at $99 per year per device.
* Separation of work and personal data is available on select Samsung devices which run the company’s Knox enterprise software.
* With iOS 7, Apple is advancing enterprise security with a similar option.
* “iOS 7 includes many new features designed to make it easier for businesses to put iOS devices in the hands of employees,” Apple writes on its iOS 7 web page. “Features such as better protection of work and personal data, management of app licenses, seamless enrollment in Mobile Device Management, wireless app configuration, enterprise single sign-on support, and default data protection for third-party apps.”
