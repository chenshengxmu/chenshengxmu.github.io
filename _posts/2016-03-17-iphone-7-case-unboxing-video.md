* Popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy on Thursday posted a hands-on video with an alleged case for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7.
* While we have already seen a fair share of purported cases for the forthcoming smartphone refresh, the quality of this particular video gives us a much closer look at some of the design changes the iPhone 7 is said to bring to the table.
* Like prior leaks, this particular case appears to confirm the general layout of the buttons on the iPhone 7, with the exception of one thing that stands out in particular.
* And that is a large cutout on the back, presumably to accommodate a rumored dual-camera lens. Aside from that, the position and size of the volume rocker and the Power/Sleep button resembles that on the iPhone 6/6s generation.
* Though the case fits the iPhone 6s perfectly, the camera cutout on the back does not line up perfectly with the location of the iSight camera on the current-generation iPhone.
* The suspicious looking cutout for headphone jack is not large enough to actually accommodate the EarPods connector, a yet another indication that the next iPhone might actually lose the 3.5mm jack in favor of Lightning-based wired and Bluetooth-based wireless headsets.
* And here’s the video.
* The supposed case for the iPhone 7, provided by prolific Apple components leaker Sonny Dickson, is based on iPhone 7 mockups and rumors and as such should be taken with a grain of salt.
* In addition to this iPhone 7 case, the video shows off yet another case, allegedly for Apple’s upcoming four-inch iPhone SE refresh. That case has circular-shaped cutouts for the volume buttons, suggesting that the iPhone SE might feature a rehashed iPhone 5s design that some rumors have mentioned before.
* The iPhone SE is said to include NFC for Apple Pay, LTE support for GSM and CDMA networks around the world and come in 16 and 64GB varieties, if a claimed packaging for the device that leaked this morning is anything to go by.
* It’s also said to share the iPhone 6s’s cutting-edge A9 processor, but lack 3D Touch.
* Apple sent out invites for their media event to be held on Monday, March 21. The press conference is said to reveal the four-inch iPhone SE, a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro and potentially some new Apple Watch bands along with updates to the OS X, iOS, tvOS and Watch OS operating systems.
