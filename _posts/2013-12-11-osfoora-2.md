title: Osfoora 2 is now available in the App Store with a complete redesign
---
* Twitter just updated its official app to include photo sharing in direct messages and swiping features to switch between timelines. Unfortunately, the official app still doesn’t live up to the wants and needs of many Twitter users.

* Osfoora 2 is a third party Twitter client that offers automatic timeline updates, bookmarking capabilities, notifications, and more. Plus, the feature rich Twitter client received an update that compliments Apple’s iOS 7 look…
* The newly updated app has been completely redesigned with a new iOS 7 look. Users can switch between dark and light mode so they can read new tweets under the covers without hurting their eyes or under the light of the sun.
* Additionally, the redesigned app features much more gesture-based interactions, like swiping to the left to call up the action menu and pulling down to refresh your timeline.
* However, you probably won’t need to pull down to refresh that often. Osfoora 2 features automatic timeline refresh when on Wi-Fi. Your timeline will be updated in real time and tweets will appear instantaneously. Plus, Osfoora 2 supports background refresh, so your timeline will be up-to-date when you open the app on your iPhone.

* The app does not include push notification. Instead, users can receive alerts of mentions and messages through local notification in background refresh.
* The third party Twitter client also lets users send links to SMS, bookmark links to Safari’s Reading List, Pocket, and Instapaper, and open links in Chrome or Safari.
* Osfoora 2 can be connected with other apps so you can send tweets, pictures, and music links through a variety of supported services. Upload photos to Twitter, img.ly, Mobypicture, TwitPic, and CloudApp. Videos can be uploaded to Mobypicture, TwitPic, and CloudApp.
* Change the look of profile avatars by choosing circles, rounded corners, or square icons in your timeline view.

* Additionally, users can add locations to tweets, mute users and hashtags, and use native retweet features. Connect multiple Twitter accounts to keep track of all users you follow.
* Osfoora 2 supports the Multiple Drafts feature. Touch and hold the compose button to activate a new tweet draft. The app also supports sharing music through the native Music app and from your iTunes library.
* Osfoora 2 is available for $2.99. Download it in the App Store today.
* Did you use the original version of Osfoora? Do you think you will download the second version?
