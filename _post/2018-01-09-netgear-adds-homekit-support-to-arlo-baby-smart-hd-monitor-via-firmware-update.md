* HomeKit support is coming to owners of Netgear’s Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitor Camera via a firmware update later this year.
* Support has clearly been limited for connected cameras that work with HomeKit, but based on this year’s CES, it is starting to turn around.
* Now it will be easier than ever for parents to check in on their little ones through Apple’s Home app. You can even ask Siri to show you the baby’s room and sooth your child with 2-way communication.
* The Arlo baby camera is a bit on the pricier side, retailing at $249, but it does offer several other features you don’t usually see in home cameras. For instance, baby crying alerts, night lights, a music player, and air quality monitoring.
* The main selling points include:
* Upcoming versions of the Arlo Baby Cam HD will have support baked in from the get-go, but existing owners will be able to have support added via an over the air firmware update.
* You can find it now on Amazon for $231.99.
