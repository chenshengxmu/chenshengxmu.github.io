* I am asked constantly how to put the iPhone in DFU mode. I always answer people and explain them how to do it but I figured after all this time, writing a post about how to put your iPhone in DFU mode was long overdue.
* In most cases, you’ll need to put your iPhone in DFU mode during the jailbreak process. It’s pretty easy but it’s all about perfect timing…
* Step 1: Launch iTunes.
* Step 2: Plug your iPhone in your computer via the USB cable.
* Step 3: Turn off your phone.
* Step 4: Hold the Power and Home button together for exactly 10 seconds.
* Step 5: After 10 seconds, release the Power button and keep holding the home button until iTunes tells you it has detected your iPhone.
