* Smart speakers coming in 2018 will have more functions, including 3D lenses for increased distances sensing accuracy and features like integrated pico projectors.
* Trade publication DigiTimes reported today that a number of Taiwan-based hardware suppliers are currently developing pico-projection modules and 3D lenses that industry sources claim will be incorporated into smart speaker devices coming next year.
* Lite-On Technology could develop invisible LED discreet components for 3D lenses based on time-of-flight sensors, the report added. Such lenses are said to “help users’ space and distance sensing accuracy or enhance the surveillance capability of smart speaker products.”
* Shipments of those modules are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2018 at the earliest.
* Nikkei Asian Review speculated that a future HomePod might use facial recognition which would presumably require some sort of dedicated 3D sensing hardware to make the gadget easier to use and people’s lives more convenient.
* However, Apple’s Siri-driven HomePod smart speaker won’t be arriving in December as originally promised because the company needs a little more time to finalize the product.
