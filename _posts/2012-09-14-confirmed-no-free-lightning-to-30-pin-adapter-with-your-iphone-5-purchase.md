* Apple’s new and 80 percent thinner Lightning connector found on the iPhone 5 and the new iPod touch has been met with criticism. As you know, existing accessories designed for the legacy 30-pin dock connector cannot connect directly to the Lightning-equipped devices without Apple’s Lightning to 30-pin Adapter, provided in $29 direct-plug and $39 cable varieties.
* Confusion arose around whether or not the adapter is including inside the iPhone 5 box. The iPhone 5 entry on the online Apple store under the “What’s in the box” section originally listed the adapter as included. However, sales reps claim the opposite and Apple has consequentially removed the item from the iPhone 5 package…
* iPhoneinCanada first reported that Apple’s online store originally listed the adapter as included with every iPhone 5 and fifth-gen iPod touch purchase, free of charge.
* Your iPhone includes a Lightning to 30-pin Adapter for connecting accessories to devices featuring the lightning connector.
* However, The Next Web chimed in with an interesting update from an Apple sales rep:
* Following the publishing on this article, TNW reader Ryan Moores reached out to share clarification he received from one of Apple’s online sales representatives. According to the representative, it is “an error” and it is “being investigated at the moment”.
* Apple has since updated the online store and said adapter is no longer listed as included.

* The Lightning to 30-pin Adapter, Apple says, is “intelligent” and “ultracompact” and lets you connect your 30-pin accessories to devices featuring the Lightning connector.
* This adapter lets you connect devices with a Lightning connector to many of your 30-pin accessories. Support for analog audio output, USB audio, as well as syncing and charging.
* The adapter does not support video out feature (that’s what the Lightning to HDMI and Lightning to VGA cables are for).
* Are you mad that Apple is providing this much-needed adapter as a separate purchase?
* In my opinion, Apple screwed everyone who pre-ordered their iPhone 5 thinking they will be getting a free adapter. Making matters worse, both versions of the adapter are scheduled to ship in October.
* Dang!
