* It seems like it’s been months since Microsoft first showed off the Surface tablet —the company’s first foray into the space. Actually, it’s been four months. But never fear, the long-awaited release date is almost here.
* Microsoft is set to launch the tablet on October 26th, alongside the latest update to its operating system, Windows 8. And it kicked off its advertising blitz last night with a new TV ad entitled: The Surface Movement…
* The ad, as pointed out by The Verge, went live during ESPN’s Monday Night Football broadcast last night. And it’s just a part of a marketing campaign for the tablet that will reportedly cost Microsoft over $1 billion.
* Unfortunately, the spot doesn’t really offer up any new information on the Surface, or its pricing. It’s a bit odd, actually, that the device launches in a week and no one has any idea what these things are going to cost yet.
* Remember, the Surface will come in two flavors: one built on ARM architecture, running Windows RT tablet software. And a Pro version, built on Intel CPUs, that will run a full version of Windows 8.
* Though Apple hasn’t officially said anything yet, we’ve heard several reports that the Cupertino company is planning an “iPad mini” event for October 23 — three days before the Surface is set to go on sale.
* And if that holds true, Microsoft is going to need more than dub step to convince consumers to buy their tablet.
* What did you think of the Surface ad? Well done, or not enough?
