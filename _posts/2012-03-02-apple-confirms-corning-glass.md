title: Apple confirms the iPhone uses Corning glass

* We’ve assumed for a long time that Apple used ultra-tough Corning glass in its iOS products. Corning, a US-based company that specializes in glass and ceramics, is the maker of the popular Gorilla Glass display cover found in several devices.
* Apple’s never said for sure whether or not it uses the scratch-resistant glass cover in its mobile gadgets. But that changed today when the company, possibly by accident, confirmed its relationship with Corning in its new Job Creation page…
* As noted by iMore, Apple seemingly let the cat out of the bag today in its new About Apple page that breaks down all of the jobs the company is currently directly, and indirectly, responsible for in the US.
* The slip can be found in the page’s ‘U.S. Jobs Supported by Apple’ section:
* “For example, this figure also includes workers in Texas who manufacture processors for iOS products, Corning employees in Kentucky and New York who create the majority of the glass for iPhone, and FedEx and UPS employees.”
* Whoops. Perhaps no one told the page’s author that neither Apple, nor Corning, has confirmed the use of Corning’s glass in the iPhone up to this point. Which is strange considering how many other handset manufacturers tout their Gorilla Glass displays as a major feature.
* Regardless, it looks like we can finally put this mystery to rest. And the next time someone brags that their device’s screen is made up of some of the toughest glass on the market, you can confidently say “me too.”
