* Dark mode-based jailbreak tweaks appear to be a pretty hot topic of conversation lately, and it would seem that this trend isn’t going anywhere any time soon.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called DarkMessages by Sticktron is now available in Cydia that gives the Messages app on jailbroken iOS 10 devices a dark mode-styled makeover.
* The dark mode completely immerses the Messages app from top to bottom with a shroud of darkness; one that your eyes will thank you for later after you’ve spent several minutes (or even hours) at a time text messaging someone at night time, when the lights are out and eye strain becomes more likely.
* Not only is the dark mode easier on the eyes, but some would even say it looks more stylish. The dark UI looks sleek and is so polished that it makes you wonder why Apple wouldn’t integrate this into iOS as a stock feature.
* One thing I will have to say about DarkMessages is that it doesn’t come with any kind of time frame settings, so if you install the tweak, your Messages app is either dark all the time, or light all the time.
* A single toggle switch exists in the DarkMessages preferences pane in the Settings app, and personally, I wish it had some kind of scheduling options, similarly to how Apple’s stock f.lux-like Night Shift feature works.

* DarkMessages accomplishes a similar function that tweaks like Eclipse and Nightmode9 can already do system-wide, however DarkMessages was built specifically for iOS 10, so it’s all ready to be used with the new Yalu iOS 10.0-10.2 jailbreak, giving it some headway in compatibility and reliability.
* If you’re interested in trying DarkMessages, you can download the tweak for free on your jailbroken iOS 10 device from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. Keep in mind that the tweak only works on iOS 10, as there was a major change in the look and feel of the Messages app from iOS 9 to iOS 10.
