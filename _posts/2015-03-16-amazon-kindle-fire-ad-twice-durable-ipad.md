* Forget about side-by-side software and hardware comparison, Apple’s iPad mini 3 is twice as likely to break into pieces should it slip out of your hand than Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD.
* That’s the key message of Amazon’s latest television commercial which paints its tablet “twice as durable” as the iPad mini 3.
* The 30-second video, which shows the Kindle Fire HD being subjected to various durability tests, is meant to reinforce the notion that Amazon tablets are sturdier than Apple’s.
* Here’s the clip depicting Amazon’s tablet being subjected to a barrage of durability tests in an industrial tumbler.

* According to Amazon, Fire HD tablets undergo over 25 durability tests and are designed to withstand forces of 1,000 g’s. “When tested against iPad mini 3 in drop tests and tumble tests, Fire HD proved 2x more durable,” argues the online retailer.
* Apple’s iPad Air promotional video also shows the device undergoing various stress tests, with Jony Ive arguing that “with less mass the iPad Air retains its structural rigidity,” as seen below.
* “This integrity, this durability inspires confidence in a product that’s meant to be taken places, handled and really used,” Ive says in the Apple video.
