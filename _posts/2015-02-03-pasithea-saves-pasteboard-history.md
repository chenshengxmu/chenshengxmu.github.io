* Pasithea is a jailbreak tweak that lets you manage pasteboard history on your iOS device. It works by replacing the Tibetan keyboard in iOS, and presents it as its own keyboard, which functions as a place to access previous items saved to the pasteboard. If you’re someone who uses copy and paste on a regular basis, and desires a better way to manage pasteboard history, then Pasithea is a tweak worth checking out.
* You’ll find a fair amount of options for Pasithea in its preference panel in the stock Settings app. There, you can disable the tweak by means of a kill-switch, adjust the max pasteboard history, and view pasteboard history all in one place.
* You can clear out all pasteboard history items at once, or chose to delete an item individually by performing a swipe-to-delete gesture. You can also rearrange the order of pasteboard history items by tapping and holding on an item and using the drag-handle that rests next to the item.

* As previously noted, you can access Pasithea’s interface from within any app that invokes the keyboard. To do so, tap and hold on the world icon next to the ‘123’ key, and select Pasithea. If you wish not to use the Pasithea keyboard, you should be able to use the tweak’s buiild in Flipswitch toggle, which presents a pop-over for accessing pasteboard items without needing to rely on a keyboard. Unfortunately, I was unable to get this working correctly, even though I tried many different settings combinations on my jailbroken iPhone 6 Plus. Let me know if you have had any better fortune getting the Flipswitch functionality to work for you.

* Pasithea is a $1.99 jailbreak tweak available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Although I didn’t have any success getting the tweak’s Flipswitch function to work, it does an overall good job of capturing pasteboard items for later usage.
* What do you think about Pasithea? Have you tried it? Sound off down below with your thoughts on the release.
