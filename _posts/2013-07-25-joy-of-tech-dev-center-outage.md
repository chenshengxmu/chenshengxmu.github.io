* It’s been more than a week now since a security researcher tapped an iAd Workbench vulnerability, prompting an unprecedented shutdown of Dev Center, but Apple is still struggling to bring all of the fifteen different services back up (only Bug Reporter and iTunes Connect were live at post time).
* The outage isn’t alarming (yet) – at least compared to the PSN breach – and Apple assured no credit card data or iTunes accounts was compromised.
* But tell that to frustrated Apple developers who are unable to access their documentation, beta code and development tools. You can tell the unnerving situation is getting out of hand when satirists start joking about it…

* So, what’s next to go down?
* iTunes activation servers?
* Wait, what…
