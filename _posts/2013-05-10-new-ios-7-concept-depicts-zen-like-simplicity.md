* Another day, another iOS 7 concept. In an attempt to depict what Jony Ive-ified, flattened user interface in iOS 7 might look like, digital agency Simply Zesty created this elaborate concept.
* The video focuses on a clean look UI and pictures Lock screen widgets, a revamped Notification Center as well as a beautiful new Windows Phone ‘Metro’-fied stock apps like Calendar, Music, Siri and Camera.
* I love the cleaner Notification Center with animated widgets. If that’s the future of iOS 7, then I’m very much looking forward to it…
* Here’s the video.
* By the way, what’s up with those square Home screen icons?
* Here are the slides, via The Next Web.

* There’s certainly no shortage of iOS 7 concept as WWDC draws near. An iOS 7 concept by Mohamed Kerroudj seems to be getting a little more attention than others so check it out for more awesomeness, including a new Dashboard feature.
* Apple said it will put “new versions of iOS and OS X” into the hands of developers at WWDC, its annual summer developers conference which this year takes place at Moscone West in San Francisco from Monday, June 10 until Friday, June 14.
