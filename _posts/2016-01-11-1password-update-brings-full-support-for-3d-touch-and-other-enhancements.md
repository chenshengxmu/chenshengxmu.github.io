* AgileBits’ popular password manager, 1Password, was updated this morning in the App Store with support for 3D Touch actions on the Home screen and Peek and Pop gestures within the app for iPhone 6s/Plus owners.
* These shortcuts permit you to quickly bring up search, view your favorites or add a new item, right from the Home screen, and preview items within the app with 3D Touch.
* In addition, the new version contains other refinements and new features such as the inclusion of Watchtower, a service that has been available in 1Password’s Mac app for quite a while and alerts you when your accounts might have been compromised, as determined by monitoring the latest security vulnerabilities from around the web.
* Pressing 1Password’s Home screen icon brings up a menu offering the following shortcuts to in-app actions: Search, Favorites and New Item.
* Within the app, Peek and Pop gestures are available for various items.

* Any saved item can be previewed within the app with Peek and Pop gestures. Just press an item to preview it or press a little deeper to pop into it full screen. 3D Touch can even be used to copy the contents of certain fields, paste or open an item in 1Browser: just press lightly on the item, then swipe up.
* Aside from 3D Touch, the app has picked up improved searching with the ability to find items from the Favorites, Categories and Organize tabs and choose between searching only item names or items in their entirety.
* “We’ve also made tweaks to speed, added a clear button and improved sorting order, and made other enhancements to our search capabilities,” developers noted.
* Next, you can copy or move items from one vault to another by tapping a new Move and Copy option. And if you want to start using the aforementioned Watchtower feature, go the Security section within 1Password’s settings interface and tap the switch.
* If an item has a potential vulnerability, you’ll see it in the item’s details view.
* This update is available at no cost to everyone.
* 1Password requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 9.0 or later.
* The app offers a WatchKit component for your Apple Watch, allowing you to access items that have been tagged with “Apple Watch”.
* 1Password is localized in English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmål, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
* Grab the freemium app at no charge in the App Store.
