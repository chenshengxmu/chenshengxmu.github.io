* App Switcher tweaks seem to be all the rage these days, so it’s not surprising to see a tweak like Muswitch pop up on Cydia. Muswitch, as its name hints to, allows you to place music controls in the iOS 8 App Switcher.
* These Music controls replace the contact shortcuts that normally reside above the cards found in the App Switcher. Watch our video walkthrough for more details.
* After installation, there are no options or settings to configure. Just play a song via the stock Music app or any third-party music playing app, and invoke the App Switcher. Once you do, you should see the name of the track, artist name, and transport controls for previous, play/pause, and skip.
* The developer of Muswitch has crafted his tweak to work just as well in landscape mode as in portrait mode. He’s also made sure that it works with any app that plays media.
* If you’re looking for important information about your currently playing song or media, such as album artwork, album title, song title, and artists, you can invoke Muswitch’s now playing section. To do so, simply swipe left on the transport controls to reveal it.
* As you can see, Muswitch is an extremely simple tweak, but that simplicity lends itself to stability. Even on a 1.0 release, I felt that Muswitch was a solid tweak that worked just as advertised. It certainly won’t blow your mind, but if you’re looking for this type of functionality, you can’t go wrong with this release.
* Muswitch is available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. I think it’s worth checking out, even though it eschews the contact shortcuts found in the App Switcher. I never find myself using those shortcuts anyway, so I don’t feel like I’m missing much as a result.
* What do you think? Sound off down below with your thoughts on the tweak.
