* I’ll be the first to admit that Safari’s mobile browser in iOS isn’t the greatest. It’s lacking some serious features that you’ll only find in third-party applications. However, it is the stock browser, and for that reason alone it’s the most popular.
* Luckily, the jailbreak community is really good at tweaking stock iOS apps to make up for missing options. Such is the case with this next tweak, which adds a homepage button to the feature-starved browser…
* Home Button in Safari is a pretty straightforward utility. It allows you to access a homepage within Mobile Safari. The site can be set in the Settings app, and can accessed from the Share menu in the native browser. The tweak also works with Home Page in Safari.

* While I kind of dig the idea of having iDB as my homepage, I’ll probably just end up keeping it bookmarked. If you want to check it out for yourself, Home Button in Safari is available in the Cydia Store for $0.99.
* Have you tried this Safari tweak yet? Thoughts?
