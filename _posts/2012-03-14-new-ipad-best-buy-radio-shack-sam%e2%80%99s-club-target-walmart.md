* It’s been confirmed that the new iPad will go on sale this Friday at 8am. The bad new is that if you want an iPad on launch day, and if you haven’t pre-ordered yet, you will have to stand in line for hours.
* But the good news is that not only will you be able to purchase the new iPad directly from an Apple Store, but also from 5 other retailers: Best Buy, Radio Shack, Sam’s Club, Target and Walmart…
* This is perfect for those people who don’t live close to an Apple Store.
* There are one big benefit and one major drawback to buying from one of these retailers though. The main benefit is that people won’t be fully aware that Best Buy, Radio Shack, Sam’s Club, Target and Walmart will have the new iPad for sale on launch day, which means the lines at these stores will likely be much shorter than the lines at Apple Stores around the US.
* However, the one drawback is that these stores will probably have much less inventory than Apple Stores do. So the lines might be smaller, but the amount of iPads available for sale will be too.
* At the end of the day, it’s your call. I’m not a big fan of waiting in line for hours, so I pre-ordered mine last week. But if I had to, I’d probably get in line at my local Apple Store. There is something about a bunch of fanboys standing together for hours. It’s always fun times.
* Where will you get your iPad from? Directly from Apple, or from Best Buy, Radio Shack, Sam’s Club, Target or Walmart?
