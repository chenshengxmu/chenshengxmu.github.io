* Apple has filed its end of the year 10-K document, a performance report required of all companies by the SEC (Security Exchange Commission), and as you might expect, it contains some pretty interesting information about the iPad-makers.
* Perhaps most interesting is that it names Scott Forstall’s new official title at the company, following Monday’s announcement that he is no longer the SVP of iOS software: Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer…
* The Next Web‘s Matthew Panzarino has done the leg work, skimming through the lengthy document, and has highlighted some other notable points regarding Apple’s performance and spending over the past 12 months:
* The 10-K also mentions Apple’s patent litigation: “Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the company’s operations, and distracting to management.”And it speaks to the importance of app developers.
* If you’re interested in reading through the whole thing yourself, you can find it on Apple’s Investor page here. The gist of it, though the stock price doesn’t currently reflect this, is that 2012 was an amazing year for Apple.
* And it’s only going to continue to get better. The company is launching two new tablets this Friday, the 4th gen iPad and the iPad mini. And it has also recently released updates and refreshes to nearly all of its product lines.
