* Is your iPhone envious of your iPad’s ability to turn its mute switch into a rotation lock, and vice versa?
* If so, introduce your iPhone to LSCameraExtender — a jailbreak tweak that can add hardware rotation lock functionality and more…
* In addition to the rotation lock function, LSCameraExtender allows one to switch between mute/rotation functions right from the comforts of your Lock screen.
* Instead of showing the camera icon when you double press your Home button, you have the option of displaying either the mute/unmute button or rotation lock/unlock button instead.
* LSCameraExtender requires a jailbroken device running iOS 5, and is an iPhone only tweak. You can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* If you’re someone who often needs access to the rotation lock, then I think this is money well spent; it works just as advertised.
* What do you think?
