* Last week we reported that AT&T was reportedly starting to unlock iPhones that were still under contract. Though they had been a few reports of this, we hadn’t been able to verify the information ourselves.
* I decided to take the matter in my own hands and submitted a request to unlock my under-contract iPhone 4S via AT&T’s handy online form. I was a bit doubtful because I had previously asked AT&T if they could unlock this device for me, and at the time, they kindly declined, saying that they couldn’t because I was still under contract.
* A couple days after filling out the request form, I received the following confirmation email from AT&T…
* Thank you for contacting AT&T Customer Care about unlocking your iPhone.
* We have reviewed your request and confirmed that you are eligible to have the requested iPhone unlocked.
* Please allow 24 hours upon receipt of this notification to complete the unlock.
* To complete the unlock, simply:
* Additional information on unlocking can be found at http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3198
* For questions regarding AT&T’s wireless service and iPhone, please visit the Phone/Device Learning Center.
* We thank you for your continued business.
* Sincerely, AT&T Customer Care Team
* So yes, I can verify that it works. All you have to do is fill out this form and wait patiently for AT&T to get back to you.
* By the way, because I have an iPhone 4S, I didn’t even have to restore to complete the unlock process. All you have to do if you have an iPhone 4S is to pop out the AT&T SIM card and put a SIM from a different carrier (ie. T-Mobile) in. The phone will activate itself within seconds. If you have an older iPhone, you will have to restore, or I guess you can use RedSn0w to deactivate/reactivate the device, which could save you a restore.
* Now the question on my mind is why would AT&T let me unlock my eleven month old iPhone? After all, AT&T isn’t the kind of carrier that likes to do nice things for its customers. AT&T likes to do nice things for AT&T!
* Maybe they want me to unlock so I can sell my iPhone on Craigslist and buy the iPhone 5 and be locked in another 2-year contract?
