* Mophie added a new edition to its family of popular Juice Pack iPhone cases today. It’s called the Space Pack, and just like Mophie’s other cases, it features a built-in battery that can essentially double your iPhone’s battery life.
* But what really stands out about this new accessory is that it also features built-in storage. That’s right, the Space Pack supports a number of different file types and can increase the capacity of your iPhone 5/5s by 16 or 32 GB…
* Here’s an excerpt from the press release:
* “mophie®, the #1 selling mobile battery case manufacturer in North America, introduced today the mophie space pack, the world’s first smartphone case with built-in storage for iPhone 5s/5. The mophie space pack not only doubles the battery of the iPhone, but increases its storage capacity, allowing users to keep more documents, videos, music and photos than ever before.
* Available in both 16GB and 32GB models, the mophie space pack enables iPhone users to do more with their 5s/5 than previously thought possible. Users can now save and share photos, videos, music files and documents with the ability to access these files any time, without the need for a data network or using storage space on their iPhones.”
* And here is your official promo video:
* You can access the Space Pack’s built-in storage using Mophie’s free iOS app. It enables you to easily manage all of your files via a familiar local file management system, and the best part is, it doesn’t depend on a network or Wi-Fi.
* The app also supports Airplay, so you can send your documents, photos and movies to a TV, monitor, or speaker with a compatible Airplay Device, and has AirDrop integration, so you can share files with other AirDrop-friendly devices.
* The mophie space pack is available for pre-order at mophie.com for $149.95 (16GB) and $179.95 (32GB), and is slated to begin shipping on March 14 of this year.
