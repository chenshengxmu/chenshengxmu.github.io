title: How to convert various image file types to JPG or PNG on iPhone or iPad
---
* It comes up every so often where you may want to convert the file type of an image file stored on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad.
* For example, screenshots are saved as .png files, while photographs taken with the camera are saved as .jpg or .heif files. Because .jpg files are typically smaller in size due to the lesser-quality detail, you could save some storage space by converting screenshots to .jpg rather than storing .png alternatives.
* In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to convert various image file types to JPG or PNG on iPhone or iPad with a useful conversion app for iOS that can be downloaded from the App Store for free.
* If you ever wanted to change the file type of an image file right on your iPhone or iPad without the need to tether up to your Mac or PC and use expensive photo-editing software, then this app may be a good option for you. It can be used on the go, and it has a lot of conversion options that’ll satisfy just about anyone.
* Among the file types that The Image Converter can convert images to JPG or PNG are: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, TGA, and HEIF.
* After installing the app from the App Store, you can launch it from the Home screen and you’ll be presented with the interface below. It’ll ask you where you to first load a photo from your library, and then choose the output file type you would like to convert the image to.

* In our case, we’re converting a .JPEG image to a .png image, so we’ll tap on the Convert & Save button at the top, then select Save as PNG from two options. The photo will be converted on the fly and saved automatically as a new image in the photo library.
* That’s all there is to it! You have converted the file type of your image file.
* This is a solid app that gets the job done just as you would expect it to. With the long list of supported file types, and the ease of use, you can convert your image to the either JPG or PNG for almost any uses you may have for images while you’re on the go.
* On the other hand, I do have a slight beef with the fact it hasn’t been updated yet for iPhone X. It’s a pet peeve of mine when apps aren’t scaled properly, and that’s why I had to mention this so anyone in the same boat would know ahead of time.
* If you think you’ll be needing a quick way to convert your image files to different file types on your iOS device, you might consider giving this app a try. It’s free in the App Store.
