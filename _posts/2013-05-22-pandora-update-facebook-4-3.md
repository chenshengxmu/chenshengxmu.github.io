* Good news Pandora users, an update for the popular iOS client landed in the App Store this morning, bringing it to version 4.3. The update includes a handful of new features, as well as the usual bug fixes and improvements.
* As far as new features go, the highlight of today’s release is the improved Facebook integration. Users now have the ability to publish their favorite tracks and stations to the social network, helping others discover new music…
* Here’s the full 4.3 change log:
* -Publish and curate the music you love on Facebook and help your friends discover new music -Customize what you share to Facebook in your Pandora privacy settings -Tap the album artwork to discover additional music details including lyrics, artist info, and more -Easily access the enhanced track menu to create a new station or share, purchase, and bookmark your music -And of course, every release includes the usual assortment of performance improvements and bug fixes.
* The new Facebook sharing stuff is actually pretty cool. Pandora is building its own little community on top of the social network that lets your followers see what you’re listening to, listen to your custom radio stations, and vice versa.
* I also really like the new quick access menu, which is revealed by tapping the Menu icon in the top right-hand corner of the Now Playing screen. From here you can create a new station, get tracks details and share with a single tap.
* We’ll see if Apple’s rumored iRadio service ever materializes, but for now, Pandora is still my go-to app for listening to free music—it just keeps getting better. As always, you can find the latest version of the app in the App Store, for free.
