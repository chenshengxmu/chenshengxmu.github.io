* LG, the manufacturer of the iPad display, said yesterday that even though it’s currently running at full capacity, the company won’t be able to meet Apple’s demand.
* “Demand keeps growing and we can’t meet it all” said LG CEO Kwon Young-soo talking about Apple’s iPad. He added that “overall supply is likely to remain tight until early next year”. The executive admitted that LG won’t be available to meet the demand until the second quarter of 2011.
* The iPad launched in 9 more countries today so this won’t make the situation any better. “Apple may have to delay launches of the iPad for some countries due to tight component supplies and strong demand” said an LG executive to Reuters.
* If you want an iPad for Christmas, you’d better get on the waiting list now…
