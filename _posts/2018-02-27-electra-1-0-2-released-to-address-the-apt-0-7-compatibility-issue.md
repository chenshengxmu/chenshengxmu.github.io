* Following the first public release of the Electra jailbreak tool for iOS 11.0-11.1.2 this week, there were some initial discrepancies with official versions of Saurik’s Cydia dependencies.
* Electra users were later advised to avoid installing the APT 0.7 update from Saurik’s Cydia/Telesphoreo repository, but a new update to Electra on Tuesday should address these issues head-on.
* Citing the official Electra web page, version 1.0.2 includes the following changes:
* As CoolStar explains on Twitter, Electra 1.0.2 refuses connections to Saurik’s repository.

* Users will see “connection refused” errors when attempting to load it, and this is normal. Blocking the repository prevents users from installing package updates that won’t play nicely with CoolStar’s modified Cydia app and its forked dependencies.
* The update also issues a hot fix for those that might’ve inadvertently installed the APT 0.7 update from Cydia before learning that it could cause problems and resolves an issue where Electra would throw false positives about Topanga being installed when it really wasn’t. This should benefit anyone that might’ve used the LiberiOS jailbreak tool initially and decided to switch to Electra.
* This update is recommended for all Electra users and can be downloaded from the official Electra website.
