* Last week, Apple sent media invitations to an event on March 9. It is widely expected the main subject will be the forthcoming Apple Watch, which Tim Cook announced will be available in April 2015. With the invitation reading “Spring Forward,” it is much less cryptic than previous invite wording. “Spring forward” is a common phrase to help people remember to set their clocks forward, ending daylight savings time. The key here being the overt reference to a device telling time. Further, March 9 is the day after the end of daylight savings time.
* Per usual, iDownloadBlog wants to help everyone celebrate the moment by highlighting event inspired wallpapers. Inside, you will find versions of the invitation for iPhone, iPad, and desktop.
* The iPhone wallpapers are original artwork, inspired by the invitation. These wallpapers were downloaded from the AR7 wallpaper application for iPhone. The artist @AR72014, constantly updates the application with new, original creations.
