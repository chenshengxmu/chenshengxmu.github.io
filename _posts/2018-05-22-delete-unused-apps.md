* Apple makes it simple to find and delete unused apps. You know those apps; the ones you just had to have when they were first released, but are now collecting digital dust. Here are the steps.
* Take a look at your iPhone and iPad. Look at all those apps. Do you still use them? How about those countless photo and weather apps you just had to have when they were first released or those games just sitting there waiting for you to say hello. Spring is an excellent time of year to free up space on your iOS device by deleting apps you no longer use. Let’s do this.
* 1) To find the last time you used an iOS app, go to the Settings app under General > iPhone Storage.
