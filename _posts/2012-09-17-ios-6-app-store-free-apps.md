* If you’re a developer running iOS 6, try opening up the App Store app and open the Featured tab. As 9to5Mac points out, chances are you’ll be greeted with a new page promoting five free Apple apps.
* The free apps include iBooks, iTunes U, Podcasts, Find My Friends, and Find My iPhone, and all can be installed at once using the “Download Free” button at the top of this new page. Take a look inside for more info…
* Apple suggests:
* To get the most out of your iPhone, we recommend these free apps from Apple.
* The same page pops up on the iPad as well, except this time, Apple, of course, suggests that you get the most out of your iPad, instead of iPhone.
