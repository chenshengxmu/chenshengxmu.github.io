* Those of you who’ve been in the jailbreak arena for a while might remember an application by Saurik called Cyntact, which displayed your contacts picture right next to their name in your contacts list. I think Cyntact hasn’t been updated for iOS 4 but it doesn’t matter because iPicMyContacts is taking over. Commenters confirm Cyntact was updated for iOS 4.
* iPicMyContacts will display your contact picture next to his name inside the contacts and favorites screens…
* It will also allow you to quickly search the web for the contact image and add his/her picture from there. To do that, just click the small contact icon next to the contact name.
* Priced at $1.29, iPicMyContacts isn’t a bad app and certainly makes it easier to quickly find a contact in your iPhone. Give it a shot and tell us what you think.
