* And the piss contest between Apple and Samsung shall continue. Later last month, a San Jose, CA judge ruled that Samsung should give 5 of its latest devices to Apple’s legal team for them to make sure those devices do not copy the iPhone in any way. Samsung requested the same from Apple but the court quickly denied the claim.
* Today, FOSS Patents reports that Samsung filed a complaint against Apple before the International Trade Commission (ITC), asking for an import ban against the iPhone, iPad and iPod…
* The combination of the accused products and the defendant means that Samsung is asking for an import ban against the iPhone, iPad and iPod. If the ITC agrees to investigate such a complaint (which is pretty certain to happen here), a final decision is reached within 16 to 18 months.
* With so much tension between the 2 electronics giants, it now makes no doubt in my mind that Apple will indeed dump Samsung for the production of its A6 chip in 2012.
* Is an ugly divorce about to happen? It sure looks like it.
* What’s your take on that?
