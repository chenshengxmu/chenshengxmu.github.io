* With a little over two weeks until its nationwide theatrical release, Open Road Films on Wednesday released the first featurette for the upcoming Jobs movie, starring Ashton Kutcher as Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs and Josh Gad as the other Steve, Steve Wozniak.
* Not only does the two and a half minutes long video offer commentary on the filming process and interviews with the flick’s stars, you’ll also get to see some new footage and scenes providing a closer glimpse at the upcoming movie.
* I’ve included the video after the jump so go ahead and have a watch…
* The official tagline: It only takes one person to start a revolution.
* Here’s the blurb:
* The extraordinary story of Steve Jobs, the original innovator and ground-breaking entrepreneur who let nothing stand in the way of greatness. The film tells the epic and turbulent story of Jobs as he blazed a trail that changed technology – and the world – forever.
* Your featurette is right below.
* In case you haven’t seen it already, your official movie trailer follows.
* My favorite part is the depiction of an engineering meeting, with one of the guys arguing that “typeface isn’t a pressing issue,” to which Jobs quips “Get out!”
* Steve Jobs famously took calligraphy classes at Reed College and it was this early interest in beautiful typefaces that later on inspired the Macintosh’s proportionally spaced fonts.
* In addition to the recently shown psychedelic movie poster, movie producers earlier in the week launched the official website so you may want to hop over there.
* Jobs opens in theaters nationwide next month, on August 16.
* Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad are scheduled for an appearance in a live YouTube event on Friday at 11am to promote the upcoming release.
* So, what do you think?
* I’m not a huge fan of Kutcher’s work, but his channeling of Steve Jobs gave me goosebumps. The actor’s clearly passionate about technology and Steve Jobs so I’m really curious to watch the flick.
* It can’t be worse than Funny or Die’s iSteve, no?
