* It’s still unclear if Apple’s rumored new iPhone 7 colorway will be a dark blue variant, as first suggested by Japanese blog Mac Otakara, or an Apple Watch-like Space Black. Today, Carrier China Unicom published an iPhone 7 teaser image on Facebook indicating Deep Blue colorway but now a more credible source has come forward with shots of claimed iPhone 7 components in a hue which appears markedly darker than Space Gray.
* UPDATE: Well, that didn’t take long: prolific leakster Steve Hemmerstoffer has some strong words to say about The Malignant and his supposedly fake chassis image.

* Pictured top of post: the claimed 4.7-inch iPhone 7 chassis showing a bigger camera hole on the backside, a tweaked antenna lines appearance and, of course, the new darker hue. The poster wrote in another tweet that GeekBar has confirmed these pictured parts to be genuine.
* GeekBar is a well-known Chinese repair shop which last week posted photos and a 25-second video—which you can watch embedded below—that gave the world its first look at a supposedly working iPhone 7 prototype running Apple’s internal testing software, called SwitchBoard, and the stock Camera app.
* The three other images The Malignant posted on Twitter show a bunch of SIM trays in the same hue as the leaked chassis. Design of the SIM trays pictured on the photos strong resembles the iPhone’s SIM tray.

* A sketchy Weibo report from June claimed the iPhone 7 would include dual-SIM trays but that’s highly unlikely given the source’s non-existent track record and his claim that the headphone jack won’t be removed from the device.
* How likely are you to pick up a Space Black iPhone 7 when the device arrives?
