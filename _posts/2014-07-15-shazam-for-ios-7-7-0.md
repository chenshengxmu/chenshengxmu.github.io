* Shazam has updated its free and Encore iOS apps, bringing them both to version 7.7.0. The update brings about a new feature to both clients that allows users to play back recognized songs in-app, courtesy of Rdio.
* While users have long been able to do this—play recognized tracks through Rdio—past functionality required them to switch out of Shazam and into Rdio. They can now playback [full] songs without switching apps…
* Here are your release notes:
* What’s New in Version 7.7.0
* This release brings full track playback in Shazam, powered by Rdio. Once you’re connected, you can play any track and carry on listening to the music as you discover more in the app. Shazam a song to get started.
* Got a question? Take a look at our community pages on http://support.shazam.com and don’t forget to follow @shazam to keep up to date with all the latest news.
* Happy Shazaming!
* Obviously you’ll need to have the Rdio app installed, and a functioning account. But the fact that you can now play back full songs, on demand, within Shazam is still significant—particularly because it’s now an Apple partner.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of the Shazam app in the App Store for free. There’s also a paid version available for folks who want additional functionality, for both iPhone and iPad, that will cost you $6.99.
