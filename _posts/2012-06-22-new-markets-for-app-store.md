* During the WWDC keynote last week, Tim Cook announced that Apple was planning to open up the App Store to 32 new countries sometime this month.
* Yesterday, the company made good on that promise. Apple sent out an email to developers last night announcing the following new App Store markets…
* The move brings the total number of countries with access to the App Store to 152. That’s pretty impressive considering all of the different languages and currency that involves.
* If you’re in one of these new countries, expect it to take a couple of days for your favorite apps to populate. Developers must agree to a new TOS before their apps can go on sale.
