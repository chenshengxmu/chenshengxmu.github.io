* Along with being able to order the new Apple TV, you can also order several new accessories to go along with your shiny new set top box. There aren’t a ton of accessories immediately available for the new Apple TV, but some of the ones that are available may be worthy of your consideration.
* There are a few key accessories that Apple is promoting on its online store during the new Apple TV checkout process: the Siri Remote, Remote Loop, and the SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Controller. Should you consider buying any of these in addition to your new Apple TV?

* Let’s start with the easy one, the Remote Loop. This product is there to help keep your Siri Remote safely tethered to your wrists so that you don’t have to think about accidental slips, drops, or flings.
* The Remote Loop actually clicks into the Lighting connector on the Siri Remote for secure attachment and easy removal. It’s also adjustable so that you can obtain the most ideal fit. The Remote Loop is only compatible with the new Siri Remote.
* Apple is charging $12.99 for the Remote Loop, which is fairly inexpensive in Apple terms. At the end of the day, however, it’s nothing more than a glorified lanyard, but it may prove beneficial, especially for children. If you plan on playing games that take advantage of the motion sensing capabilities of the Siri Remote, you may want to heavily consider it.
* It wouldn’t be right to talk about the Remote Loop without at least mentioning Nintendo’s Wii Remote, and wrist strap. This design borrows heavily from the Wii Remote’s wrists straps, and it’s intended to work in a similar manner.
* The fact that the Loop attaches to the Lightning port on the Siri Remote is nice. That means you don’t have to wrestle with threading the strap into a small hole, and doing the reverse when you want to remove it. It’s literally just plug and play.

* Since the new Apple TV already comes bundled with the Siri Remote, this is a purchase that you’re going to have to more carefully consider than the other two. Do you truly need more than one Siri Remote? In most cases, the answer to that question is no.
* First of all, the Siri Remote is on the pricey end of the scale, at $79, so it’s not something that you can just buy without thinking about it.
* But besides price, you can’t use two Siri Remotes at the same time.
* So why is Apple selling extra Siri Remotes if only one can be used per Apple TV? The most likely answer is breakage or loss.

* The SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Gaming Controller ($49.95) is the only controller that Apple seems to be pushing during the new Apple TV launch. As such, you can consider it to be the de facto standard controller for those of you who want a traditional gaming experience on the new Apple TV.
* The Nimbus is a Bluetooth 4.1-enabled wireless controller that lasts for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Speaking of charging, the Nimbus features a Lightning port, which allows it to charge it just like the Siri Remote.

* The Nimbus features pressure sensitive buttons, dual analog control, dual left and right triggers, digital 4-way input, and color-coded player indicator LED lights on the face of the controller. It also features a menu button to allows you to access the Apple TV home screen menu and interface.
* If this is the controller that Apple is pushing, then I think it’s a no-brainer purchase for anyone truly interested in gaming with the new Apple TV. In fact, I’ve already purchased mine. I think the $49.95 asking price is reasonable, and don’t forget that this controller will work with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch as well. Expect a full video review of the Nimbus controller as soon as we get our hands on it.
* There are other accessories that Apple is advertising on its new Apple TV page, but these three are by far the most interesting, and will likely be under the heaviest of consideration from Apple TV buyers. In the end, I ordered the Remote Loop and the Steel Series controller. What accessories did you opt for?
