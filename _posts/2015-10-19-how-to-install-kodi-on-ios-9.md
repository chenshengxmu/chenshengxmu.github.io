* Kodi (formerly XBMC) has been updated to work with iOS 9. Prior to the update, the package would download and install on your jailbroken iOS device, but would crash upon startup. The folks behind Kodi just pushed an update that fixes the crashing issue.
* We’ve talked about this app many times on iDB and via our Let’s Talk Jailbreak podcast. Kodi is one of the best apps for viewing media content, and streaming media content from an IP based over the air antenna solution on iOS. You can also use Kodi to stream local content from a NAS or from a PC.
* Needless to day, Kodi has lots of uses, and now it’s officially available for iOS 9. In this post, we’ll show you how to add the repo necessary to install Kodi on your iPhone or iPad running Apple’s latest version of iOS.

* Kodi is an awesome media interface for jailbroken iOS 9 devices
* Keep in mind that, due to a heavy traffic load, the download may be inordinately slow. You can also direct-download Kodi by browsing to the Kodi repo location on your desktop, downloading the .deb file, and manually installing it via iFile on your iOS 9 device.
* That said, the download via the web is just as slow. If you really want Kodi, just wait for the download to finished using the instructions contained above. It takes a while, but it will eventually download and install successfully. Just be patient.
* Are you a Kodi user? If so, how do you use it?
