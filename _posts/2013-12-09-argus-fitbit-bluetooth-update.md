* Azumio’s Argus fitness software was the first App Store app to gain low-power motion tracking via support for the dedicated M7 motion coprocessor inside the iPhone 5s.
* Today, the developer has refreshed the app with a bunch of fixes and a couple new features, including the new Close Friends social capability, the ability to import Fitbit data, support for Bluetooth heart rate monitor for activities and other goodies.
* The updated item is now live in the App Store and free for everyone who’ve previously purchased the program…
* On top of the aforementioned new features, Argus 2.8.63 now supports the LifeTrak C410 and LifeTRNr SYNC accessories and lets you change your profile photo within the app. There are now more useful stats in the Activity details screen, with the all-new Run/Cycle/Hike activity recording dashboard with live map and heart rate support.
* With full support for the iPhone 5s’s M7 chip, Argus can continue collecting motion activity data while it’s suspended, with a minimum impact on your battery. On the other hand, some realtime Argus features are not compatible with the M7, such as step count on the app’s Home screen icon, gestures for adding water and automatic run detection.
