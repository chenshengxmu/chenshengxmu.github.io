* The iWatch, Apple’s alleged fitness/health wearable device, may not launch in November alongside a 5.5-inch iPhone 6, as previously rumored.
* If a revised guidance for the third calendar quarter of 2014 by Apple supplier TPK Holdings is an indication, ongoing production issues are to be blamed that the gizmo is running behind schedule and is now said to launch by the end of the fourth quarter.
* Although TPK during its quarterly conference call with analysts did not mention Apple by name – nor has the Taiwanese supplier blamed Apple for its poor third-quarter performance – the iPhone maker is its biggest client and the rumor-mill did identify TPK as a supplier of flexible iWatch displays…
* Citing reports by Chinese-language United Daily News [Google translate], GforGames is mentioning the possibility of another iWatch delay as TPK has now pushed the expected surge in Apple orders back by three months.
* Instead, TPK now expects a considerable increase in profits throughout Q4 2014, which hints at the idea that the iWatch will enter mass production within the aforementioned time-frame, as opposed to Q3.
* Asian investors also believe that the iWatch will enter mass production “sometime during the fourth quarter of the year,” reports GforGames.
* Specifically, analysts at CSLA, a leading Asian investment banking and asset management firm, think Apple will ship six million iWatch units this year, a significant reduction from the firm’s previous estimate of 20 million iWatches in 2014.
* I myself am not convinced that we’ll see an Apple wearable this year at all and have recently offered my reasons why I think the iWatch won’t release before Spring 2015.
* Developed by TPK, flexible nanowire layers have higher conductivity and outstanding flexibility while being transparent to the eye. These treats make the material adaptable to curved screens while allowing for thinner designs overall as nano wires don’t need additional sensors to register touch events.
* TPK recently signed a deal with Japan-based Nissha Printing to mass produce nanowire layers and optimize the technology for use with touch panels.
* Founded as a joint venture between TPK, Nissha Printing and Silicon Valley firm Cambrios, TPK subsidiary TPK Films is understood to have been tasked with building touch panels based on silver nano wires, using a special ink made by Cambrios.
