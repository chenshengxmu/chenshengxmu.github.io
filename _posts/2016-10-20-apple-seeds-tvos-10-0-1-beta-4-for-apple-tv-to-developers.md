* Following fifth betas of iOS 10.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 that were seeded yesterday to the registered developers and public beta testers, Apple today released a fourth beta of the upcoming tvOS 10.0.1 software update. tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4 (build “14U71”), a developer-only release, is available as an over-the-air update via the Software Update mechanism on fourth-generation Apple TVs with an appropriate configuration profile.
* The new beta arrived ten days following tvOS 10.0.1 beta 3 and more than two weeks after the second beta was seeded to developers.
* Release notes accompanying tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4 make no mention of any outward-facing feature additions. For beta 4, Apple is asking developers to focus on one last remaining issue in UIKit that causes the “Hold To Dictate” text to appear in a dark color when the search keyboard is configured to be explicitly dark.
* tvOS 10.0.1 is expected to bring about mostly performance improvements and various bug fixes. “tvOS 10.0.1 includes bug fixes and improvements in the OS,” as per Apple.
* We’ll update the article with other changes in tvOS 10.0.1 beta 4 as we encounter them.
* tvOS 10.0.1 has been in testing since September 21.
