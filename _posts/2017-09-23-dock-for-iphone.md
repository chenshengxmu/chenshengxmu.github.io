* Dock+ for iPhone is a spiffy new jailbreak tweak by iOS developer XCXiao that introduces a plethora of hand multitasking features to the Dock on your iPhone.
* Not only does the tweak let you summon your dock from virtually anywhere on your unlocked device with an Activator action, but it even lets you launch several apps as resizable windows side-by-side on your screen.
* Once you summon the Dock with Activator, you can tap on any of your app icons to launch them in full-screen mode. Alternatively, you can use a tap and hold gesture on any of your apps to launch them in the windowed form you see in the screenshots above
* While in windowed mode, you can use the red button to close the window, the yellow button to reduce the alpha level of the window, the green button to make the app full-screen, or the resize button to adjust the size of the app on your screen.
* To use the resize tool, you would just tap on the button and use a two-finger pinch gesture to scale the app to your personal preference.
* It’s worth mentioning that the tweak brings a slick iOS 11-like aesthetic to the Dock, so you’ll notice how the corners are rounded just like they are on the iPad. You can also bump your Dock’s app limit up to five if you have an iPhone with the larger 5.5-inch display.
* To configure Dock+ for iPhone, you can visit the preference pane in the Settings app:

* Here, you can enable or disable the tweak on demand and access three different cells of settings: Dock + Gesture, Dock + App, and Dock + Window. We’ll go over all three various sections below:

* Dock + Gesture
* In this section, you can configure the Activator action that you want to use for summoning Dock+ from within apps. You’ll probably want to select a gesture you can use anywhere, such as a double-tap on the Status Bar gesture (this is my personal favorite).
* Dock + App
* In this section, you can configure how you interact with apps from the Dock+ interface. The main gesture of the tweak as of the latest version is to tap and hold on apps to launch their windowed counterparts so you can turn this feature on or off from here.
* Dock + Window
* In this section, you get a few more options that might tickle your fancy, such as:
* The settings under all of these sections require a respring to save, so a respring button is included under the main preference pane for your convenience.
* Dock+ for iPhone seems like it would complement any jailbroken iPhone nicely. It’ll be useful for getting to your favorite apps more quickly, but having the ability to use side-by-side windowed apps can be beneficial for your multitasking efforts too.
* If you’re interested in trying Dock+ for iPhone, then the tweak can be had for $2.00 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. It works with iOS 10 iPhones only, but a separate version of the tweak, dubbed Dock+ for iPad, brings these features to iPads too.
* As a friendly note, the developer notes that you can obtain a copy of the iPad tweak for free after purchasing Dock+ for iPhone (or vice-versa) by contacting them through Cydia.
