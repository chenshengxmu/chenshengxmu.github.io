* Apple has added four new clips to the World Gallery films section of its “Shot on iPhone 6” microsite. The company launched the Shot on iPhone 6 campaign earlier this year, showcasing beautiful photos and videos taken with its latest smartphones.
* The new videos are very similar to the previous ones, in that they are 15 seconds long and accompanied by an analogous soundtrack. They were captured by photographers from countries around the world, including the US, Australia and Norway.

* Unlike the photos section of the World Gallery, Apple doesn’t mention any editing apps, suggesting that the videos are untouched. The stock Camera app in iOS offers several video-related features, including slow motion capture and time-lapse.
* There are now 11 videos and more than 50 photos on Apple’s Shot on iPhone 6 site, which you can view here.
