* The rumored iPad Pro could adopt an oxide LCD screen technology, with Sharp, LG Display and Samsung Display all sending out samples, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported Thursday.
* The company allegedly assessed different technologies ranging from a-Si, TFT LCD and oxide LCD before deciding to go with the latter. The report adds that the iPad Pro will go into mass production in the third quarter of 2015.
* Sharp is expected to be the main supplier of oxide LCD panels for the iPad Pro, with LG identified as the most likely contender. “Panel suppliers are expected to be chosen soon and afterwards will begin producing limited amounts of supply around May followed by mass production in July and August,” markets sources told the publication.
* Back in November 2014, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the 12.9-inch iPad would adopt oxide LCD tech to achieve quick response times and high color saturation.
* Bloomberg last night reported that the larger iPad has been pushed back until fall due to delays involving the supply of display panels.
* In addition, The Wall Street Journal has learned that the device may come outfitted with USB 3.0 ports for connecting mice, keyboard and possibly other USB accessories such as external storage.
