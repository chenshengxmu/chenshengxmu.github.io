* Following the reset of iTunes March earlier this week, Apple just released iTunes 10.5 beta 9 for developers, a pre-release version of iTunes with iTunes Match beta. iTunes 10.5 beta 9 includes several performance enhancements and bug fixes, and is a required update for all iTunes Match beta subscribers.
* If you use iTunes Match beta, remember that your iCloud libraries will be deleted at the end of this beta. This will require you to scan, match, and upload songs again. Also note that some of the features and optimizations of iTunes Match may not be available during this betaâ€¦
* iTunes 10.5 beta 9 is safe for jailbreakers and unlockers.
* You can download it from the the iOS Dev Center.
