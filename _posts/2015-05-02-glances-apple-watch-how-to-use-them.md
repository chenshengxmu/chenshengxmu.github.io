* Glances on Apple Watch are quick summaries of information that can be quickly viewed at a glance—hence the name. Glances contain, or at least should contain, information that you view the most frequently.
* Why did Apple include Glances in Watch OS? How many glances can you have configured at once? These questions, and others are answered in this Glances overview.

* Apple designed glances as a quick way to access important information and functions without launching an app. Since the Apple Watch is all about quick interactions, glances fit right into Watch OS’ scheme. To view your available glances, simply swipe up from the watch face and swipe left or right to browse each enabled glance.

* Step 1: Swipe up from the watch face
* Step 2: Swipe left or right to navigate through all of your available glances
* The page dots at the bottom of the screen will indicate your current location in the list of glances and how many glances are enabled.
* Step 1: Open the Apple Watch companion app on iPhone
* Step 2: Tap the My Watch tab
* Step 3: Tap Glances
* Step 4: Use the drag handles or the ‘+’ or ‘-‘ signs to add or remove items from glances
* Keep in mind that the order of your glances will determine their order in the glances interface. The top glance will appear in the most-left position, and the bottom glance will appear in the most-right position. It’s good to keep in mind the order of glances so that you can arrange most important items in a way that’s convenient for you.
