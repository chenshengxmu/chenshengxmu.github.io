* If you’ve ever looked at the calendar application on your iPhone or iPad and realized a bunch of old events were missing, then let me reassure you, you’re not the only one, and there is an easy fix! In this post, I will show you how to stop your past appointments from disappearing, and restore past events at the same time.
* The symptoms are pretty obvious. Open the Calendar application (or any third-party calendar app) on your iPhone or iPad, then scroll back in time to 3 months ago, for example. You’ll realize that all your events are gone, except for those that are set as recurring, such as birthdays or holidays. Scary!
* The reality is not that the calendar app is deleting events, but rather it has stopped from syncing them, and instead of leaving them on the device, it just removes them past a certain time frame. However, this doesn’t mean your calendar events are gone. They’re still there. If you use iCloud for example, they are all safe and sound on Apple’s servers. I don’t use Google for my calendar needs, but I assume this is the same, no matter what service you use.
* If you want to restore your old calendar events, but also keep this issue from happening in the future, follow these steps:
* 1) On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > Calendars.
* 2) Look for the Sync tab, and tap on it.

* 3) By default, events are synced back to one month, but you can change that. Depending on your needs, select 3 months, 6 months, or all events.
* And that’s it. Depending on the time frame you chose, your past missing events will show up again in the Calendar application. Obviously, if you want all your events to always be on the device, then choose the All Events option.
* I think it’s interesting to note that the Calendar application on Mac doesn’t behave this way. All your events are synced on the Mac and there is actually no option to change the sync period. I assume this has to do with storage space, since you have more room to store that data on your Mac than you would on your iPhone for example.
* It’s also worth mentioning that if you use iCloud to store your calendar events like I do, you can always see all your past events by going to iCloud.com, and logging in using your username and password.
* So there, you have it. If you thought the calendar app automatically deleted past appointments, I hope this will reassure you.
