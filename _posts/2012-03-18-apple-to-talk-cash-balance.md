* During Apple’s quarterly earnings call earlier this year, it was discovered that the company’s pile of cash was approaching the $100 billion dollar mark. And everyone wants to know what it plans to do with it.
* Well it looks like we won’t have to wait much longer to find out. As noted by MacStories, Apple has just sent out a press release announcing that it will be holding a conference call early tomorrow morning regarding its massive cash balance…
* “Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO and Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO, will host a conference call to announce the outcome of the Company’s discussions concerning its cash balance. Apple will not be providing an update on the current quarter nor will any topics be discussed other than cash.”
* There are a wide range of theories floating around of what Apple is planning to do with the money. We’ve heard everything from investor dividends (giving cash back to investors), to a large company acquisition. I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.
* The conference call is scheduled to begin at 9:00 am EDT in the morning. The company will be streaming the call live on its website, and you can bet we’ll be listening in for anything of interest.
* What do you think Apple is going to announce?
