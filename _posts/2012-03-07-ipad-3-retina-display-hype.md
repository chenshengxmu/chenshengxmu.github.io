* Among the seemingly hundreds of contradicting iPad 3 reports we’ve heard over the past few months, one piece of gossip in particular has held true: the Retina display. And like so many of the other rumors, this one materialized today.
* Apple just unveiled its new tablet, the iPad 3, complete with a staggering 2048 x 1536 resolutions. Simply put, this means the screen of the new tablet contains roughly 4x more pixels than its predecessor…
* Philip Schiller talks about the iPad’s amazing Retina display:
* To this day no one has yet matched that display technology on any mobile device. We’re going to bring it to the 9.7 inch screen of the iPad. This presents a problem for us though… for the first time an iPad has a higher resolution than even the display behind me. […] Text sharper than a newspaper. Photos will look incredible. Fonts look amazing, it’s a huge step forward. […] Put another way, you all have an HDTV at home , 1080p — an iPad has more pixels. That’s incredible.
