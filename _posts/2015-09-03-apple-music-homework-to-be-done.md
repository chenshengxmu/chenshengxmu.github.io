* Even though Apple Music Connect “is growing big-time,” there’s still “a lot of work going into making” Apple Music better and “a bit of homework to be done” when it comes to improving Apple Music Connect, said an Apple executive in an interview with The Guardian newspaper this morning.
* “There’s a lot of work going into making the product better,” said Oliver Shusser, Apple’s Vice President of iTunes International.
* He said the team is fixing both bugs and inconsistencies that have been plaguing many early adopters of Apple Music. “Remember, this was a very big launch in 110 markets instantly, so we get a ton of feedback,” he continued.
* “We’re obviously trying to make it better every day.”
* In addition to usability improvements and bug fixes, software teams at Apple are even more hard at work on improving human curation, a key aspect of Apple Music.
* “Our focus is on editorial and playlists, and obviously we have teams all around the world working on that, but we’re also adding features and cleaning up certain things,” he said.
* As for Connect, an Apple Music feature where artists can share additional content and interact with their fans, it’s “growing big-time” with more and more artists connecting to their fans, but “we still have a bit of homework to be done for the rest of the year.”
* Lastly, the promised integration between Apple Music and Sonos Hi-Fi equipment, as well as an Apple Music Android app, are both coming along nicely although “we still have some work to do there.”
* These comments represent the most direct admission yet from Apple of its awareness that Apple Music is a bit rough around the edges and I’m glad they’re working around the clock to fix the nagging issues and make the experience more enjoyable for everyone.
* The iPhone maker has lost an important executive as Apple Music senior director and Beats 1 lead Ian Rogers resigned from Apple last month to join the French luxury powerhouse LVMH.
