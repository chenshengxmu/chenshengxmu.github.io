* You’ve seen the supposed photos of the upcoming iPhone 5S’s chassis and watched a video depicting the scratch-resistance of the plastic iPhone 5C. Now what? Well, how about the ultimate video hands-on showing off the rumored gold/champagne iPhone 5S and a blue iPhone 5C variant next to an iPhone 5?
* Your prayers have been listened to: you’re in for a treat as one blogger has posted exactly such footage, and it’s been making the rounds this morning…
* Dom Esposito of AppAdvice has gotten hold of a high-definition video that seems to provide a rather detailed comparison of what appears to be the casing of Apple’s rumored gold iPhone 5S and the polycarbonate plastic iPhone 5C.
* The clip compares the iPhone 5S/5C casing to the existing two-tone aluminum and glass design of the current-generation iPhone 5, have a look below. Of course, there’s no telling whether these parts are legit, even if they line up with previous leaks.
* Esposito writes:
* As shown in the video, the back inlay on the gold/champagne iPhone 5S has enough room to accommodate the rumored dual LED flash, but aside from its color, there’s not much of a difference when compared to the iPhone 5.
* The author notes that the “iPhone” text on the back appears to be a bit thinner on the 5S relative to the 5, though“its font matches the text found on the blue iPhone 5C”.
* As per usual, you’re advised to proceed with caution, pinches of salt and everything.
* A couple notes here.
* Firstly, even though these images look authentic, there’s no telling whether the supposed plastic iPhone represents a genuine part or if it’s some prankster’s exquisite 3D print (imagine that).
* Secondly, that gold iPhone 5S casing could have been easily faked by anodizing the existing iPhone 5 chassis and most people wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.
* Thirdly, it could also be a counterfeit iPhone – they’re that good.
* Fourthly, the iPhone 5C shell could be for an Android handset – it wouldn’t be the first time a white-label maker sold an Android phone based on the budget iPhone design.

* And lastly, even if these are actual prototypes, there’s no telling if we’re dealing with the final designs here or early-stage prototypes that Apple could have dropped long ago.
* For the sake of completeness, our favorite parts leaker Sonny Dickson published the above image today, suggesting another possible iPhone 5S color option – graphite.
* At any rate, the prevalence of these “leaks” is a tell-tale sign we’re getting close to the official announcement.
