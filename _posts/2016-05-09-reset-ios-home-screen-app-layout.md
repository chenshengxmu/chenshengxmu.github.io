* If you have ever wanted to reset the Home screen‘s app icon layout to factory settings, then you might be happy to hear that there’s an easier way than moving the app icons all back to where they were one by one.
* Instead, in this tutorial, we’ll be showing you how you can reset the Home screen app icon layout automatically in just a few seconds.
* Sometimes you get bored with the Home screen configurations you make and you decide to start all over. It’s okay! There’s nothing wrong with wanting a fresh slate to start all over again, and you may not want to completely restore your device through iTunes.
* To easily reset your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad Home screen layout, simply follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app on the iOS device you want to reset the Home screen app layout on.
* 2) Navigate to General > Reset > Reset Home Screen Layout and tap on it.

* It’s super easy to reset the Home screen app icon layout to the factory defaults. I see too many people struggling to move them all back themselves on a day-to-day basis, so I just hope more and more people can learn about this super simple button that makes magic happen with just a tap.
