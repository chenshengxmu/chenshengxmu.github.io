* It’s been a busy day with regard to jailbreaking. Tons of tweaks are being updated, Cydia just got its biggest update of all time, and now the team behind the Pangu jailbreak is about to push an update to integrate Cydia into the package.
* If you’ve yet to jailbreak, your reasons for not doing so are slowly starting to run out. Pangu says that if testing goes well, they will release the updated version tomorrow…
* This note was posted on the Pangu team’s official page on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo:

* It basically states that if all goes well, we should see an updated version of Pangu with Cydia built-in within the next 24 hours. The update can hit any time, and since China is many hours ahead of the US, it could touch down sooner than later.
* Are you happy?
* Thanks, Jonas.
