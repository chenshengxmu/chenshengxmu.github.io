* Conspicuously timed ahead of today’s massive iPhone 5 event, Android boss Andy Rubin this morning wrote on Twitter that there are now half a billion Android devices activated around the world. The stunning figure represents a material increase over the stats Google chairman Eric Schmidt shared just a week ago…
* Here’s Andy’s tweet:
* There have been half a billion android activations to date, with over 1.3 million added every day.
* Google’s Hugo Barra corroborated the information in a post over at Google+.
* We don’t have up-to-date stats for Apple apart from the updates shared during June quarter’s conference call with investors:
* • 410 million iPhones, iPads and iPod touches in the wild • 150 million iCloud users • 650,000 apps in App Store

* A week ago, Google chairman Eric Schmidt shared at the unveiling of the new Motorola Razr lineup that the search giant counted a whopping 480 million Android devices in the wild.
* The 20 million units increase in seven days amounts to a daily average of 2.9 million activations. That’s in stark contrast to the cited average of 1.3 million daily activations. Such a notable surge can probably be credited to the Googlerola announcement.
* If Google continues to activate at least 1.3 million devices each day, this time next year the company will hit the billion devices milestone.
* By the way, of all days Andy figured today might be a good day to announce the new Android milestone.
* Coincidence?
* Note: with under an hour left until Apple’s presser, get up to speed with our huge iPhone 5 roundup.
