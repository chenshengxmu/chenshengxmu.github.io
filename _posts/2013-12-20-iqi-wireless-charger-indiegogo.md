* Despite a number of rumors and patent filings, Apple has yet to give any of its iOS devices the power of wireless charging. While many manufacturers have built the technology into their handsets, iPhones continue to use the plug-n-charge approach.
* Luckily, for those looking for wireless charging, there are a handful of third party options available. And today, we’re going to talk about a new one called iQi Mobile. It’s a Qi standard wireless charging receiver, with a unique, ultra-thin flexible design…

* The iQi Mobile supports the iPhone 5, 5C, 5S and the 5th gen iPod touch. The receiver uses your typical Qi wireless charging tech—a built-in coil interfaces with the charging pad’s coil to transmit power—and it connects through your phone’s Lightning port.
* It’s extremely thin size means that there’s no need to keep your device in an ugly, bulky, proprietary case. So, unlike many of the other third-party wireless options on the market, the iQi Mobile can be used in conjunction with your favorite slim iPhone case.
* As you’ve probably figured out by now, the iQi Mobile isn’t available yet. The creators have working prototypes and have taken to Indiegogo to help kickstart production. If you’re interested, a pledge of just $50 gets you an iQi receiver and a charging puck.
* It’s worth noting that the iQi isn’t MFi-certified, meaning it’s quite possible you could run into issues down the road, but people don’t really seem to be worried about that. As of this writing, the project is nearing $140,000 in funds—well past its $30k goal.
* What do you think of the iQi Mobile wireless charger?
