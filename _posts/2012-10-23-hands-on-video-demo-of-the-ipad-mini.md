* With Apple’s dual-core A5 chip, the same found inside the iPad 2, the iPad mini has enough horse power to drive existing apps because pixel count didn’t change: the device still features a 1,024-by-768 pixel resolution screen like the iPad 2. As a consequence of the smaller display, the pixels are more densely packed, yielding crisper images and fonts.
* Its 7.9-inch display is rated at 163 pixels per inch versus 132ppi for the iPad 2 (264ppi for the iPad 3 and 216ppi for the Nexus 7). Taking it all in, The Verge had a chance to briefly play with the new gizmo after Apple’s events, here are their impressions and a nice hands-on video…
* The Verge editor Joshua Topolsky writes that the iPad mini is “an incredibly thin and light design”.
* Build quality is top notch, he notes.
* I must say I’m a little concerned about scuffs – as previously noted – due to its diamond cut chamfered edges and aluminum chassis with anodized finish, like on the iPhone 5.
* Topolsky writes (emphasis mine):
* Like most Apple products, the build of the smaller tablet is excellent, easily surpassing the competition on the market. By comparison, the Nexus 7 and Fire HD feel like toys. Other manufacturers are going to have to up their game with this product in town. It’s just a striking difference in materials and solidness.
* Indeed, here is a nice comparison of size and display characteristics of all iPad models, courtesy of Apple.

* Topolsky only had a couple of minutes to put the iPad mini through its paces so he focused on graphics performance and the general smoothness of the device.
* Performance on the tablet, however, suggests that it will do just fine with the current crop of iPad software. Applications I tried out seemed to run as snappily as anything on the 3rd generation iPad.
* Titles like Real Racing 2 took a little bit of time to boot up, but gameplay was fine. My suspicion is that fewer pixels to push around onscreen makes for speedier performance overall.
* He also says the keyboard “feels a little bit more squished” in portrait and of course “a little more comfortable” in landscape.
* Here’s the video.
* I don’t know about you, but to me responsiveness, smoothness and UI performance are of utmost importance in a mobile device and to hear that the iPad mini doesn’t disappoint in this regard is exciting.
* And if the above hands on video demo is an indication, Apple’s gonna sell truckload of these.
* Just look at how small and compact and irresistible the iPad mini is.
* I most definitely will be getting one for myself, in white & silver, I think.
* You?
