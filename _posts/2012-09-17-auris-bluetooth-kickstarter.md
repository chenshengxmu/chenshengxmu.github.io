* Starting with the iPhone 5, Apple is going to be changing the dock connectors in all of its future iOS products. The new Lightning plug will be replacing the decade-old 30-pin connector.
* Worried that all of your old speaker docks will become obsolete? Don’t be. You can either purchase a 30-pin to Lightning adapter, which Apple sells for $29, or you can grab the auris…
* The auris is a new Bluetooth music receiver that plugs directly into any 30-pin speaker dock, allowing you to continue to use it to play music from your iPhone, iPad or Android device.
* It’s small, about the size of an iPod shuffle, and doesn’t require any batteries. It also takes advantage of the new low-power Bluetooth 4.0 standard, and can store up to 8 paired gadgets.
* Tochkraft, the developers behind the auris, says that they already have a fully functioning prototype. And they have taken to Kickstarter to try and raise $40,000 to start mass production. If you’re interested in helping fund the project, $27 puts you on the pre-order list.
* As I was writing about the auris, I discovered that there were already similar products on the market. Well then what I’m about to say applies to them as well, what an utterly fantastic idea.
* What do you think of the auris?
