* Ostium is a new jailbreak tweak that adds a screen splitting animation to Notification Center. The tweak works with a two finger pinch gesture, along with the more traditional slide from status bar gesture.
* At first it appeared that the developer was only going to release Ostium for iPad, but iPod touch and iPhone support were added late in the game. I can definitely see the two finger pinch being more suited for the iPad’s larger screen, but as you’ll see, it works reasonable well on the small screen too.
* Ostium features a settings app that allows you to disable the split screen effect for the traditional Notification Center gesture (slide from status bar), along with outright disabling the springboard two finger gesture.
* There’s also an option to enable Notification Center’s slide animation, for a combination of both styles. Personally, I prefer to leave the slide animation off, because it makes the tweak’s effect more pronounced.

* I think it would have been even cooler if the developer added a visual zipper teeth for a true unzip animation, but I’m not sure if that’s what they had in mind in to begin with. I’m just thinking out loud here.
* Ostium is available on Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $0.99. If you decide to try it out, let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
