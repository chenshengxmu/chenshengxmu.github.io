* With the release of iPhone 5, Apple has tweaked its sales tactics, making the handset available across more than a dozen regional carriers in the United States, in addition to major wireless operators like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint that have traditionally served as the most important iPhone distributors in the country. You can now add Strata Networks to your list of iPhone-friendly regional carriers because the company started advertising it will be offering the iPhone 5 soon…
* According to Strata’s web site, the device is “coming soon”.
* You can register your interest by leaving your email address to be notified when the iPhone 5 becomes available through Strata Networks.
* Regional carriers typically offer the iPhone 5 with a $50 discount compared to major US telcos so Strata could likely price the handset at $149 with a qualifying two-year contract.
* They haven’t released pricing or availability information as of this writing.
* Strata’s nationwide coverage map is available as a PDF document.
* The Utah-based carrier started deploying its 4G LTE network ahead of Christmas 2012.
* Their LTE network now covers local markets in Colorado and Idaho, including several counties in Utah and the Uintah Basin in Duchesne County.
