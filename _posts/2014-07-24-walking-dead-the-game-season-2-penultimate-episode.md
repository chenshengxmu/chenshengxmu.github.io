* It’d be an understatement to say that Telltale’s iPhone and iPad adaptation of Robert Kirkman’s “The Walking Dead” comic book series has a strong following out there.
* The incredibly popular episodic game series is comprised of five individual chapters, with Episode 3 of Walking Dead: The Game – Season 2 (the sequel to the original Walking Dead: The Game) having arrived back in May
* Today, Episode 4 landed in the App Store as a free update to those who already own the $4.99 graphic adventure game. The penultimate episode is titled “Amid the Ruins” and introduces new twists to the story of Clementine…
* From the blurb:
* Free of their brutal captor, the group resumes their journey north. But hunger, violence and death have taken their toll. Simmering conflicts and inevitable changes within the group remind Clementine that danger can come from within, as well as without; she must choose her allies carefully in this penultimate episode of The Walking Dead Season 2.
* Here, check out the cinematic trailer for Episode 4.
* The series is arguably the best-looking and most-engaging cinematic adventure on the iOS platform.  As Cody recently told you, Telltale is readying a brand new game based on AMC’s popular “The Walking Dead” television show.
* Titled The Walking Dead: No Man’s Land, it’ll release early in 2015.
* Walking Dead: The Game – Season 2 is available in the App Sore for $4.99.
* The 532MB universal app requires iOS 6.0 or later.
* The game now includes the first episode titled “All That Remains,” with the remaining episodes (“A House Divided,” “In Harm’s Way,” “Amid the Ruins,” and the upcoming “No Going Back”) being offered via the In-App Purchase mechanism for $4.99 each.
* If you plan on playing all episodes, Telltale is offering a one-time $14.99 season pass which includes all five episodes at a 25 percent discount.
* To download new chapters, use the game’s Episodes menu.
