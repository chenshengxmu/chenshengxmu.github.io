* How many times have you misplaced your keys in the last few years? Ok, how about your iPhone? Children? Well the good news is that there are actually iOS accessories that can help you with your forgetfulness, like the hipKey.
* The hipKey is a simple proximity sensor, powered by Bluetooth, built to help you keep track of your valuables. It has a key ring, allowing you to attach it to your keys, purse, etc., and a companion iPhone app for easy tracking…
* From hipKey’s website:
* “The hipKey is a high tech way of keeping track of your valuables. Simply attach the device to the item of your choice and you’re ready to go. Made of a sculptured one-piece anodized aluminum ring surrounded by high-quality plastic parts, its sleek oval form fits perfectly in your palm or pocket. You can even attach it to your keys.”
* The sensor has four modes. Alarm mode warns you if you forget your iPhone or iPad. Child mode alerts you if your child wanders too far, Motion mode detects bag and purse thefts, and Find Me mode, quickly finds your keys or iOS device.
* The hipKey’s battery supposedly lasts between two and four weeks between charges, thanks to its use of low-energy Bluetooth. That tech also gives the device a wider range—somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 metres or 164 feet.
* While there are currently several products like this available on the market, few have seen the wide-ranging success of hipKey. It actually first went on sale in Europe last December, but quickly sold out due to the high demand.
* But it’s back, and being offered through Apple’s online store in both Europe and, for the first time, the US for $90.
