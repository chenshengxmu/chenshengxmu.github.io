* In addition to iOS 9.3.2, Apple on Monday released OS X 10.11.5, watchOS 2.2.1 and tvOS 9.2.1 to the public. You can find the updates in the Mac App Store, in the iOS Watch app, and by navigating to Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software on your fourth generation Apple TV.
* From what we saw in the various developer and public betas for the above updates, none of them are going to include any significant user-facing changes. They’re mostly maintenance releases, featuring bug fixes and other improvements aimed at ironing issues noticed in previous software versions.
* As usual we’re going to remind folks who are jailbroken on tvOS 9.0 or 9.0.1, or who wish to keep this option open, to stay away from software updates, as there is no public jailbreak available for recent versions of tvOS. We’re installing today’s updates now, and will report back any notable findings.
