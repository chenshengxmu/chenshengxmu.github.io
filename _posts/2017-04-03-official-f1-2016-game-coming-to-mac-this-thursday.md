* Developer Feral Interactive announced Monday that it will be releasing a Mac port of Codemasters’ official game for the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship this coming Thursday, April 6. The game takes advantage of Apple’s new graphics API, Metal, so it should squeeze every bit of power from your Mac’s GPU. It includes various online multiplayer game modes that let you compete against up to 21 players on any of the 21 Grand Prix circuits.
* “It’s been three years since a new F1 game graced the Mac and a lot has happened since then!”, said David Stephen, Managing Director of Feral Interactive. “F1 2016 is a massive step forward for the franchise, greatly improving upon the fastest and most thrilling on-track racing experience in gaming.”
* Some of the headlining features include the paddock, licensed F1 drivers, teams and circuits, the iconic Safety Car and Virtual Safety Car, manual starts and the Formation Lap which lets players experience “the height of the pre-race tension and feel the pressure of the all-important start”.
* They’re promising the most immersive, in-depth career mode ever featured in the franchise. Aside from the extensive multiplayer mode, the game’s career mode includes up to ten seasons, with tracks spanning the full 21 F1 circuits.
* Check out the announcement trailer below.
* F1 2016 is a resource-intensive title.
* You’ll need at minimum a Mac with a 2.8Ghz Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB RAM and at least NVIDIA 680, AMD R9 280M or Intel Iris 540 graphics card or better with two gigabytes of video RAM. To really nail the racing line, you’ll want a 3.3Ghz Intel Core i7 processor with 16GB RAM and a 4GB AMD R9 395X graphics card.
* The game will be available on the Feral Store and Steam for $59.99 and on Mac App Store for $49.99. You can pre-order F1 2016 on the Feral Store.
