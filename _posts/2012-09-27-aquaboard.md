* AquaBoard is a new tweak that allows you to add water effects to your iPad or iPhone. The effects can take place on your Home screen or Lock screen, or can be relegated to just one of the two.
* Included with AquaBoard are numerous animations, tweaks, and settings to fully customize the effect to your liking. It looks good on the iPhone, but as you’ll see in our video walkthrough, it looks really good on the iPad…
* AquaBoard is developed by the same person that developed CallBar, so you know it’s from developer that values quality. While this tweak isn’t going to enhance the user experience on your device, its subtle, or even not-so-subtle water effects might produce a calming effect within you. If your life is filled with day-to-day hectic activity, then that in itself might make the $2.99 asking price worth it.
* If you’re interested in trying AquaBoard, then head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo and download it today. Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments below if you decide to give it a go.
