title: Rip-off report- AT&T doubling its device upgrade fee

* AT&T is changing the price of their fee to upgrade handsets while on contract, reports BGR.
* Originally, AT&T only charged customers $18 to upgrade to a new device, but now they want to charge $36. And to top things off, their reason is pretty bogus…
* Because the overall costs associated with upgrading to a new device have increased, effective Sunday, February 12, 2012, AT&T will change its upgrade fee from $18 to $36.
* AT&T’s raised $36 fee will begin this Sunday, February 12th. If you were planning on getting your loved one an iPhone for Valentine’s Day and are currently on AT$T, we suggest you do it tomorrow.
* Of course, $36 isn’t an insane amount of money , but AT$T wanting to charge us $36 to have a customer rep click on a new device on a computer seems like a little bit of a rip off to us.
* What do you think of AT$T raising the fee?
