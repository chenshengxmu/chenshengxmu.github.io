* Mac users may remember Apple’s iSight branding for its standalone and built-in webcams. However in recent years, Apple hasn’t used the appellation, replacing it with the FaceTime branding. But bringing the term back, iSight was reintroduced during yesterday’s iPad announcement. Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller showed off the new iPad’s camera, which was given the name iSight.
* As noted by MacRumors, Apple has also extended the iSight name to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S’s rear camera…
* While discussing the iPad’s new camera, yesterday, Phil Schiller said:
* On the back we have a camera, and when that camera gets of such quality and capability that you’re proud to use it as your everyday camera for photographs, we call it an iSight camera. And the new iPad has a great iSight camera.
* As for the front camera on all three devices, Apple is still calling it the FaceTime camera. The new camera naming has not made its way to the iPhone 3GS, however.

* I personally love the iSight branding, because it not only sounds good, but should help customer’s make distinctions between the devices’ two cameras.
* Apple’s new iPad rocks a 5-megapixel camera. The example photos Apple posted on its website look great, and we certainly can’t wait to give the camera a try on March 16th. For comparison, the iPhone 4S’ features an 8-megapixel iSight camera, while the iPhone 4 features a 5-megapixel iSight camera.
* What do you think of the iSight branding?
