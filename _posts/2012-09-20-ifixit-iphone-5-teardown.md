* Though we’ve still got a good 8 hours or so before the iPhone 5 officially goes on sale here in the US, due to the time difference, the handset has already launched in Australia.
* And wouldn’t you know it, the i-teardown experts over at iFixit were on hand to pick one up and have already started ripping it apart. More on their findings inside the fold…

* For starters, iFixit noted that their 5-point screwdrivers still worked on the iPhone 5 pentalobe screws, though they are different. But the good news is, the screen opens from front to back, making a cracked screen “easier than ever” to fix. Looks like iMore was right.

* Next, as expected, Apple has changed up the battery a bit in the new iPhone. iFixit notes that while the 4S battery was of the 3.7V – 5.3Wh – 1432mAh variety, the 5 is has a 3.8V – 5.45Wh – 1434mAh setup. It provides the same talk time, 8 hours, and 25 more hours of standby.

* Coming to the logic board, iFixit discovered the much talked about A6 processor, and the rumored Qualcomm MDM9615M LTE modem, which supports several wireless bands.

* Other interesting notes from the teardown include a metal bracket-supported Home button, which will hopefully reduce wear and tear, and a new-and-improved iSight camera.
* We’ll obviously learn more about the iPhone 5 and its innards as time goes on. But for now, this information and these images are a great start. You can see the full teardown here.
