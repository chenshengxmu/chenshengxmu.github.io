* Now that the iPhone 5 launch has come and gone, the rumor mill’s attention has turned to the iPad mini. Apple is widely expected to unveil a smaller version of its popular tablet sometime within the next month.
* There’s been a lot of talk over what the slate will look like, with the most recent chatter stemming from a leaked black rear shell that reportedly belongs to the tablet. And as usual, this has inspired some mockups…
* Gizmodo has just published some gorgeous iPad mini mockups from designer Martin Hajek. If the name sounds familiar, that’s because he was also behind these head-turning iPhone 5 renderings from a few months ago.

* Hajek has once again based his mockups on previously-leaked parts. The image at the top of the post is of what he believes the iPad mini could look like with a black anodized aluminum shell (same as iPhone 5 back panel). 
* Gizmodo speculates that the iPad mini could come in several different colors, including white (with a white anodized back), and possibly blue. It opines that the choice in colors would separate it from the rest of the budget slates.

* Of course, this is all pure speculation at this point. But given how close Hajek’s iPhone 5 images were to the real thing, it wouldn’t surprise us at all if Apple’s new tablet ends up looking something like the above images.
* The iPad mini is said to feature a 7.85-inch display and an extremely thin profile. And the latest rumors suggest Apple will send out media invites for its debut event sometime within the next week or so.
* What do you think of the mockups? Do you think the iPad mini will look like this?
