* The Today page, accessible in both Notification Center and Spotlight, typically displays the date above all the widgets you’ve enabled. On stock devices, the date is aligned to the right.
* While the right-aligned date doesn’t look bad, having a centered date doesn’t look too bad either, and with a new free jailbreak tweak called CenteredDate by iOS developer dahamtob, you can center Today page’s date indicator for a more aesthetically-pleasing effect.
* Shown above, you see an example of how the tweak looks in Notification Center. Below, another example illustrates how the same effect looks from the Spotlight page:

* Both styles look acceptable in my opinion, so choosing one over the other will come down to your personal preference. Because this formatting isn’t customizable out of the box, the tweak one-ups stock devices by providing a way to stand out.
* Unfortunately, CenteredDate only impacts the date indicator on the Today pages accessed from the Home screen’s Spotlight page and Notification Center; it remains right-aligned when looking at the Today page on the Lock screen:

* It’s a small oversight, but it seems to me like this is something the developer could change with a few keystrokes to the code in a future update.
* CenteredDate doesn’t have any options to configure, so what you see is essentially what you get. If you want to give CenteredDate a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository as long as you have a jailbroken iOS 10 device.
* Do you like the right-aligned or center-aligned date indicator more? Share in the comments below!
