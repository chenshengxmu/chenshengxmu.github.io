* Apple has just released a brand new iTunes 11.3 update which enables iTunes Extras for HD movies on Mac computers. Moreover, iTunes 11.3 finally brings back iTunes Extras to the $99 Apple TV media-streaming box after Apple killed support for this useful content-enhancing feature back in 2010.
* As if that wasn’t enough, the company confirmed that these interactive menus with featurettes, behind-the-scenes videos, director’s commentary and other interactive assets will be coming to iOS 8 in Fall…
* iTunes 11.3 release notes:
* iTunes 11.3 includes all-new iTunes Extras for HD movies. iTunes Extras can include behind-the-scenes videos, short films, high-resolution image galleries, director’s commentaries, scenes and more.
* These immersive interactive features are like DVD extras and are automatically downloaded when you buy a movie on iTunes which has iTunes Extras.
* And now, for the first time iTunes Extras can be enjoyed on Apple TV with Software Update 6.2 and will be available on iOS 8 this Fall. Actually, the original Apple TV supported iTunes Extras, but Apple then inexplicably removed support for the feature following a major Apple TV hardware refresh back in 2010.
* The Apple TV Software Update 6.2 rolled out less than two weeks ago.
* Apple notes that iTunes Extras will be automatically added to your previously purchased HD movies as they become available, and at no addditional charge.
* You can download the most recent stable version of iTunes through the iTunes download page. Alternatively, choose Software Update... from the Mac menu.
