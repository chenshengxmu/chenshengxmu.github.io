* It’s no secret that I’m pretty pumped about Amazon’s Kindle Fire. While I know that may seem disgraceful to say on iDownloadBlog, I have to admit that the Fire looks sort of compelling.
* The Kindle Fire is obviously no match for the iPad, but it isn’t trying to compete with the iPad — that’s why I think it’ll succeed. Now that the formalities are out of the way, let’s talk about Kindle Fire for iPhone — a DreamBoard theme that make your iPhone look similar to Amazon’s upcoming foray into the world of tablets…
* Kindle Fire for iPhone can be purchased on Cydia for $2.49. Admittedly, I think that’s a tad steep for the functionality that you get, but if you’re as pumped about the Fire as I am, you may deem it a worthwhile investment.
* One thing to keep in mind is that this theme requires DreamBoard, which in turn requires a jailbroken iPhone.

* Hat tip to iPhoneman76 at iDeviceDaily for the heads up on the theme’s presence on Cydia.
