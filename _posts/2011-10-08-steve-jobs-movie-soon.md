* The day after Steve Jobs passed away, I thought to myself that there had to be some movie studios who’d want to make a movie out of the amazing story of his life. And it seems I was right.
* According to Deadline, Sony Pictures is set to acquire the rights to Walter Isaacson’s upcoming biography of Steve Jobs, and make a movie out of it…
* “I’ve just learned that Sony Pictures is making a hefty deal to acquire feature rights to Steve Jobs, the upcoming authorized biography by former CNN chairman and Time Magazine managing editor Walter Isaacson. I’m hearing the deal is $1 million against $3 million and that Mark Gordon will be the biopic’s producer. […]
* The studio seems a good fit for the book, having boiled business books into compelling dramas with both the Oscar-nominated The Social Network and Moneyball.”
* I already pre-ordered a copy of Steve Jobs’ biography. Now I can’t wait for this movie to come out.
* What about you?
