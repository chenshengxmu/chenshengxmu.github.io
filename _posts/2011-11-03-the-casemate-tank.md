* Apple has been highly criticized for the glass panels it uses on the front and back of its smartphone. The design was introduced in 2010 with the iPhone 4, and has obviously stuck around with the unchanged iPhone 4S.
* The glass casing means that the handset isn’t very durable. Luckily, cases can help protect it from drops and other accidents. In fact, Case-Mate makes one that will protect the iPhone from being run over by a large SUV…
* MacRumors spotlights the new Tank iPhone case from Case-Mate. Typically, Otterbox has been the brand synonymous with durable iPhone cases, but it appears the Tank is looking to steal some of its thunder. Check out this promotional video:
* How can the Tank take so much punishment? Here’s an excerpt from its product description:
* “Modeled after motorcycle helmet engineering, Tank is designed with a hard, impact resistant exterior and a shock absorbing interior. A shatter resistant, polycarbonate hard shell combines with the thick, silicone cushioned interior. The retractable screen shields from impacts, cracking, and condensation, fully protecting the iPhone screen. The Tank exterior is made of a premium, soft grip texture that slides easily in and out of your pockets.”
* If you’re looking for a highly-durable iPhone case, this might not be a bad route to go (if you don’t mind the extra bulk). The Tank is available from Case-Mate’s online store for $60.
