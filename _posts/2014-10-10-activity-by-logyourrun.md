* I’m not a slug but I’m also far from being a health freak. You won’t find me at the gym, and if you ever see me running, then call 911 because it means something went terribly wrong. Yet, with the introduction of the M7 coprocessor in the iPhone 5s which helps you keep track of how many steps you made in a given day, I became more aware of little things I could do to maintain my health. I quickly established a daily goal of 6,000 steps, which I usually track with Pedometer++, a beautifully simple step tracker.
* Federico Viticci of Mac Stories recently introduced me to a similar application called Activity by LogYourRun. Just like Pedometer++, Activity tracks your steps but it also helps you visualize the intensity of your activity in a very original way.
* What sets Activity apart from similar step tracking apps is the way it shows the data, which is displayed for each day as an activity barcode. The barcode is color coded so you can easily identify the intensity of your activity. Blue and green bars represent moderate pace activity, while red and yellow represent a faster pace activity.
* I was most active at 5.18pm

* Not only this lets you quickly visualize when you were active during the day, but it also lets you see patterns when looking at your activity history.
* Activity allows you to get a more granular view of your activity too. Tap and hold your finger on the activity barcode, and the time this activity was recorded will show. You can also drag your finger left and right to see the cumulative amount of steps that were recorded during that day.
* While not very pretty to look at, the data displayed paints an accurate picture of your daily activity and allows you to detect patterns that may help you figure out when you should try to be more active (or not).
* Activity comes with a widget that lets you see you activity directly from the Today tab in Notification Center. Again, it’s not really pretty, but it does a great job at letting you visualize your daily activity.
* Activity by LogYourRun is $0.99 in the App Store. Because it requires an M7 or M8 coprocessor, you will need an iPhone 5s or an iPhone 6 to run this app.
