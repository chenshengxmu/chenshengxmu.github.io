* Angry Birds maker Rovio today formally announced its next big thing, a new puzzler for the iOS platform based on their IP acquisition of Casey’s Contraptions, a charming and addictive puzzle game by Snappy Touch and Mystery Coconut.
* Rovio hinted in early-May that it would re-write and re-brand Casey’s Contraptions as Amazing Alex. The game will be launching in July on iOS and Android platforms, with Windows following soon after. Here’s your trailer…
* So who’s Alex?
* This whiz kid has a boundless imagination and a houseful of fun toys that can turn anything into a great adventure! From cleaning up his room to playing in his backyard, Alex creates amazing chain reactions to get the job done with the maximum amount of fun.
* And here’s the introductory trailer.
* As you can see, Amazing Alex takes a page from Casey’s Contraptions’ book, tasking you with building crazy contraptions and Rube Goldberg-like machines with toys and everyday items to solve puzzles.
* You can set the objects up to bounce, pop, ricochet, bash and crash into each other and each level has a bunch of different solutions to it. Rovio is promising a hundred levels spread across four fun locations in the initial release, with more content coming in regular free updates.
* And right from the get-go, the game will let players design and share their own levels, using built-in level editor and 35 interactive objects.
* More information is available at the official Amazing Alex website.
* What do you think, does Amazing Alex looks like another smash hit for Rovio?
