* Adobe launched new services at its annual Adobe MAX creativity conference today while updating the Creative Cloud lineup and releasing a pair of brand new mobile apps: Photoshop Fix and Capture CC.
* Built on the Photoshop technology, Photoshop Fix, a free download from the App Store, brings desktop tools like Liguify and Healing Brush to image editing on the go.
* Capture CC, another new app available at no charge, includes functionality provided by several mobile apps like Adobe Brush, Adobe Color, Adobe Hue and Adobe Shape.
* First demoed at Apple’s September 2015 ‘Hey Siri’ media event, Photoshop Fix lets you do serious image retouching and restoration on your iPad or iPhone.
* The app uses Photoshop technology and brings powerful desktop tools such as Heal, Smooth, Liquify and more to the mobile world. Signed in users can access edited photos directly within other Adobe mobile and desktop apps, powered by Adobe’s CreativeSync solution.

* The app can open and edit layered Photoshop files and syncs your edits via the cloud with Photoshop CC for further refinement, Lightroom and other connected apps.
* “And all your edits are synced across all your computers and devices,” Adobe boasts. “Make a change on you iPad, it’ll show up on your desktop.”
* Photoshop Fix is iOS-only at launch, with an Android version planned in the future. It shouldn’t be confused with Photoshop Mix, another iOS app from Adobe.
* An Internet connection and a free Adobe ID account is required to use Photoshop Fix. You can sign up for an Adobe ID within the app for free.
