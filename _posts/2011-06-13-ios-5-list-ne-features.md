* When Apple unveiled iOS 5 last Monday, Steve Jobs mentioned that their new OS for mobile devices included 200 new features. 10 of them were demo’d on stage, but what happens to the 190 remaining features?
* Apple didn’t give us a list of these 200 features, so it was left to beta testers to find them out by themselves. After spending almost a week with iOS 5, we’ve compiled the most comprehensive list of new iOS 5 features to date. This list counts 121+ new iOS 5 features, both documented and undocumented…
* The way Apple counts “new features” can be a little redundant. For example, Twitter integration is not just 1 feature but it covers several of them (ie. Twitter for maps, Twitter for Safari, etc…), so technically, there aren’t really 200 new features.
* We need your help. If we missed something, please leave a comment below and we will add your findings to the list.
