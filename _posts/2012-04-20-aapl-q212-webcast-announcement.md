* Apple will webcast its calendar 2012 second-quarter earnings next Tuesday, April 24 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern. The call will include Apple’s performance metrics and sales figures from a three-month period which ended March 31.
* According to analysts, Apple is expected to report iPhone sales anywhere between 26 and 44 million units, with the best analysts’ consensus of 35 million units. Some folks are worried about a 24 percent drop in iPhone activations by Verizon and rumors that carriers might drop iPhone subsidy that hurt their bottom line.
* I opined these concerns are overblown and should be taken with a grain of salt as crazypants analysts and Apple doomsayers regularly come out of the woodwork ahead of the company’s quarterly reports.
