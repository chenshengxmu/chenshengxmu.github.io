* Facebook on Thursday rolled out a new update for its Messenger app, bringing the iOS client to version 38.0. The update brings about long-awaited support for watchOS 2, meaning you can finally use the popular messaging app on your Apple Watch.
* Introduced this summer, Facebook Messenger for Apple Watch allows you to send and receive things like voice messages, Likes and stickers, and you can also dictate messages and tap the Location button to quickly send out your current location.
* Here are Facebook’s release notes:
* You can now use Messenger on watchOS 2! Send and receive voice clips, Likes, stickers and more. With iOS 9, you can now find Messenger contacts and conversations from your phone’s search screen, and access Messenger from the list of multi-tasking apps on your iPad.
* As Facebook notes here, in addition to Apple Watch support, today’s update also includes better iOS 9 compatibility. So now both iPhone and iPad users can access their Facebook contacts from Spotlight, and on iPad, the app now supports multitasking.
* You can download Facebook Messenger in the App Store for free.
* Thanks Eddy!
