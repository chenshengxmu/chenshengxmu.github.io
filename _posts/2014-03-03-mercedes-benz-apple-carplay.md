* After Apple formally announced its long-expected iOS in the Car initiative today at the Geneva Motor Show – rebranded as CarPlay – car maker Volvo was quick to post a video showing it off in action. Not to be outdone by Volvo, rival Mercedes-Benz has now shared additional tidbits pertaining to how it plans to integrate CarPlay into an upcoming C-Class.
* And just like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz is keeping its options open by not pledging exclusive support for CarPlay. In addition to its own in-car entertainment system, the company is going to support not only Apple’s CarPlay, but also Android-based in-car infotainment system when it launches later this year. Let’s get down to the nitty-gritty…
* According to Mercedes’s press release, Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Group Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, made it clear that his company will pursue a multi-platform approach.
* Specifically, Mercedes-Benz intends to continue to offer its existing solutions such as Drive Kit Plus, Digital DriveStyle App, COMAND Online and Mercedes-Benz apps, all putting the power of smartphone apps at drivers’ disposal.
* Two years ago we set a new trend with the integration of the smartphone into our vehicles, and Apple and Google have picked it up. We offer our customers an ideal in-car infotainment system.
* We are constantly developing the connected car with the latest technologies available, so that every Mercedes-Benz driver can use their smartphone in the car in full comfort and safety.
* The company showed off CarPlay integration in a new C-Class at the Geneva Motor Show. Like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz will also allow drivers to use both its own and Apple’s solution simultaneously.
* Support for Android-based smartphones will be available from the middle of the year, as soon as Google brings its own in-car infotainment system to market.
* Back in January, Google announced the Open Automotive Alliance, an in-car Android integration initiative which aims to replicate Google’s success with Android on mobile devices, only in your car.

* CarPlay will be enabled via an upcoming iOS 7 software update on Lightning-enabled iPhones, including the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5.
* The feature includes limited third-party application integration via support for music apps by Spotify, Beats Radio, Stitcher and iHeartRadio. Third-party mapping applications are not supported at this stage as CarPlay exclusively taps Apple Maps.
* Note: additional images are available at the Mercedes-Benz website here so make sure to give them a look for the complete overview.
