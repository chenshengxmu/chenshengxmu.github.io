* The folks at Tapbots on Tuesday issued an update for their popular Twitter client Tweetbot 4, bringing the iOS app to version 4.1. The update brings about a number of fixes for bugs including timeline jumping and in-app browser issues, as well as proper Apple Watch support.
* With Tweetbot on Apple Watch, you can view your ‘Activity’ feed—which shows things like @ Tweets, Favorited (or liked) Tweets and new followers—and reply to those notifications. You can also Favorite Tweets, reply to Direct Messages and compose Tweets using voice dictation.
* Here are the release notes:
* – Apple Watch Support – Hopefully fixed issue where timeline would jump to the top on launch – Hopefully fixed Tweetbot browser getting stuck when swiping back – Definitely fixed a bunch of other bugs
* Tweetbot 4 launched last month with a refreshed design, a new Activity feed, universal support for iPhone and iPad and many other improvements. It’s currently my favorite Twitter client, and if you haven’t tried it yet, it’s work checking out. You can find it in the App Store for $4.99.
