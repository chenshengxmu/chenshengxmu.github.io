---
* The Google Mobile application for the iPhone now offers push notifications for Gmail and the Google Calendar. The app is free in the App Store and is said to offer “real” notifications that give you message type previews.

* Previously iPhone users were required to use a 3rd party service to bring these types of notifications to their iPhones. Also included in the app is “search as you type” results.
* Let us know if you’re able to download the update and tell us how its working in our comment box.
