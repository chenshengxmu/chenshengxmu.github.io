---
* Instagram lets you personalize your experience to what matters to you the most. For instance, you can hide Instagram posts, Stories or both in your feed, without unfollowing their accounts.

* This feature is a silent update that doesn’t require a new version of the mobile Instagram app, which you can download free of charge in App Store. If you don’t see the mute feature yet in your Instagram app, check back after a few days or weeks.
* Muting began its staggered roll-out today. The company will be bringing out this feature gradually over the coming weeks so not all Instagram users will gain this capability at once.
* TUTORIAL: How to download your Instagram posts, Stories & other account data
* An alternative to unfollowing, muting permits Instagram users to mute someone’s posts, Stories or both without unfollowing them, which is a great feature.
* Here’s how.
* To mute an Instagram account, do the following:
* 1) Open the mobile Instagram app on your iOS device.
* 2) Find a post or Story to unmute.
* 3) Tap “…” in the corner of the post.
* 4) Select an option from the popup menu:
* To abort the operation, tap Cancel.

* When you mute someone, they won’t know you’ve done so.
* You can still view profiles of anyone you’ve muted on their profile page. Additionally, you will continue getting push notifications from any muted users who have tagged you in posts or commented on one of your posts or Stories.
* TIP: You can also alternatively mute posts and Stories by pressing and holding on a Story in your Instagram tray, or by tapping the three-dotted icon from an account’s profile page.

* To get their posts back in your feed, follow the step-by-step instructions laid out in the previous section, but choose the Unmute option from the popup menu instead of Mute.
