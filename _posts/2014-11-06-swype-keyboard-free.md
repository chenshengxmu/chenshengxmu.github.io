* I have a love/hate relationship with third-party keyboards. On the one hand, they theoretically provide a better way to input text on your iOS device. On the other, I’ve found them to actually make me waste more time than I would using the stock keyboard. But I’m not giving up yet on keyboards, especially on Swype, which has been my favorite one so far.
* Normally priced at $0.99, Swype is currently available for free as Apple’s App of the Week in the App Store for a limited time. If you aren’t familiar with Swype, check out Lory’s first look at the third-party keyboard. Since she published it, the app has also been updated with support for more languages and improved iPad layout, making it an even more solid option.
* It’s still not perfect to me yet (ie. switching back to the default iOS keyboard is a pain), but this is the best I’ve used so far. Obviously, your mileage may vary, but at the price of free, it’s definitely an alternative you should consider if you haven’t yet.
