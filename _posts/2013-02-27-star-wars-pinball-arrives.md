title: Star Wars Pinball arrives via Zen Pinball update
---
* As promised, Star Wars Pinball from Zen Studios has arrived on the iOS platform, launching today as an add-on to the company’s Zen Pinball (a free  universal binary download). Celebrating the launch, developers have released a new teaser trailer which highlights the intergalactic bounty hunter Boba Fett.
* The previous trailer covered a table on the main deck of a Star Destroyer, based on the Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back movie. Each of the three tables is available as a separate $1.99 purchase from Zen Pinball. Zen Studios has pledged to release the game as a standalone download and we’ll update the article with a link to that version as soon as it hits the App Store…
* Over time, developers plan to release a total of ten Star Wars-themed tablet, each featuring “a different iconic moment from the Star Wars universe, with interactive 3D characters, and unique gameplay.”
* This is the officially licensed game so it uses real voiceovers from the Star Wars movies. Check out another teaser trailer highlighting Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, AT-AT Walkers and Tie Fighters…
* And here’s the original teaser from two weeks ago.
* I’m a bit of a sucker for pinball games on my iPad so I’ll be checking out Star Wars Pinball, that’s for sure.
* What’s your favorite iOS pinball game?
