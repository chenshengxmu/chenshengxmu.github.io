* You wouldn’t know it by listening to HTC’s Martin Fichter, but it seems that the demand for Apple’s next smartphone is higher than ever before. According to a recent survey, the pre-launch hype for the iPhone 5 exceeds that of the iPhone 4.
* Analyst Mike Abramsky announced the results of a recent RBC/ChangeWave survey this morning, which shines some light on the growing interest in Apple’s upcoming smartphone. And unless you’re Mr. Fichter, the results shouldn’t surprise you…
* According to AppleInsider, the poll took place between August 2nd and August 10th, and involved 2,200 respondents. In all, 31% of those that were polled are planning on buying the iPhone 5. That’s a 6% increase over a similar survey last year.
* Abramsky also pointed out that the iPhone 4 is nearly 15 months old, and millions of users will soon be coming to the end of their two year contracts. That might help explain the 66% of current iPhone users who plan to buy the new device.
* On top of the large number of upgraders, the survey also showed strong demand for Apple’s next smartphone with Sprint and T-Mobile customers. In fact, more than 50% of subscribers polled said they would likely buy the iPhone if it was available.
* In wake of the results, Abramsky has raised his estimated fiscal 2012 iPhone sales 5 million units to be 110 million. He thinks Apple could sell 27 million iPhones in the first quarter alone. That’s 6 million more phones than last quarter.
* So what does all of this mean? For most of us, not much. We’ll determine whether we want the iPhone 5 or not when Tim Cook (or whoever) hoists it up on stage in the next few weeks. But for Apple, it means it has some major expectations to live up to.
* Can they do it? Are you planning on getting the iPhone 5?
