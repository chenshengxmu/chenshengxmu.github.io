* Less than a month adding a new Night Mode feature to its Maps app, Google is back with a host of new features for its popular iOS navigation app. The latest update to Google Maps, version 4.10.0, brings new features like new Street View thumbnails, custom maps, and support for six additional new languages.
* Of course, Google also took the opportunity to update the Maps app with its new logo. Not only will you find the new Google logo inside of the Google Maps app, but the Mountain View, CA company has also updated its popular app with a brand new app icon.
* Here is the full change log for Google Maps version 4.10.0:
* Of course, the biggest new changes are the ability to view custom maps and the new Street View thumbnails. For Street View thumbnails, all you need to do is tap and hold on a location on the map to see a quick thumbnail of that location. You can then tap on the thumbnail to load the full Street View interface.

* The custom maps option, accessible view the pull out menu on the left side of the app, allows you to view maps you created using the browser-based Google My Maps option. You’ll need to log in to your Google account to take advantage of the ability to view user created maps.

* You’ll also need to be logged in to see the new review-writing workflow, which makes it easier to tag locations with custom reviews and ratings.

* Last but not least, today has been a big day for Google with the revealing of its new logo. The new logo is present in splash screens, on the mapping interface, and on the brand new app icon itself.
* It’s yet another substantial update for Google Maps on iOS, which still happens to be my preferred method for navigation on iOS. You can find the latest update over on the App Store, and it comes in at just a hair under 30MB.
* What do you think about Google Maps’ new features?
