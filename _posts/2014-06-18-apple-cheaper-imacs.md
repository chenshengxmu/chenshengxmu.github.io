* Apple’s online store went down briefly this morning as the company has refreshed its iMac family of all-in-one desktops. The baseline model now starts at $1,099, a full $200 cheaper over the previous model.
* Only the entry-level 21.5-inch iMac has been refreshed with what’s apparently a significant specs downgrade.
* The $1,099 configuration comes with a low-end 1.4GHz dual-core Intel i5 processor with three megabytes of L3 cache, a 5,400rpm 500GB hard disk drive, 8GB of RAM and integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000…
* That’s a significant step back in terms of CPU performance because this machine used to feature a faster quad-core 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 with four megabytes of L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz.
* The new Intel chip has been identified as the recently introduced i5-4260U model with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.7GHz.

* Also bear in mind that the discounted machine comes with a lower-end Intel HD Graphics 500o solution versus the Iris Pro chip. A less capacious 500GB of storage versus a 1TB hard disk drive as before isn’t helping either.
* The updated all-in-one sports the same 21.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080-pixel resolution LED display, as well as two Thunderbolt ports, four USB 3.0 ports and Bluetooth 4.0/802.11ac Wi-Fi networking.
* Although the new 1.4GHz CPU can’t be upgraded, customers can opt for a 1TB Serial ATA drive for an extra $50, a 1TB Fusion Drive for an additional $250 or a 256GB flash storage for a cool $250.
* Again, only the entry-level 21.5-incher has been updated. The $1,299 2.7GHz and $1,499 2.9GHz 21.5-inch models as well as the $1,799 3.2GHz and $1,999 3.4GHz 27-inch models remain unchanged.
* The machine is available today through the Online Apple Store “within 24 hours” and via its authorized resellers.
* More in Apple’s press release.
* What’s your opinion?
* First reactions on Twitter were largely negative. I was kinda hoping for a sub-$1,000 price point and surely didn’t expect such a downgrade in hardware specs.
* That being said, however, Apple appears to be simply clearing the decks for rumored Retina iMacs this Fall.
* Does a $200 saving justify a quad-core-to-dual-core CPU downgrade, cutting hard drive space in half and switching from Intel’s more powerful Iris Pro to Intel HD Graphics 5000?
