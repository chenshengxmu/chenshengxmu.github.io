* Boasting more than 40 years of experience, the International Consumer Electronic Show (CES) is the largest event of its type across the world and this year is no exception. As we head to January 8, the whole tech world is preparing for the largest trade show in global history, with a show floor of 1.86 million square feet. Thousands of companies, techies, press, and gadgets will be huddled together at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Nevada.
* I will be heading to Vegas to cover all of the action focused around iOS devices, which includes everything from third party hardware to software. Representing iDownloadBlog as an an official member of the press, I will have access to preshow events and additional after hours meetings with some of the big names surrounding iOS compatible products. To keep everyone in the loop, this article is an opportunity to give our readers a preshow look at what to expect from an attendee’s perspective…
* The convention begins on Sunday, January 6 at 4:00PM (local time) with a huge official opening event for the press, termed “CES Unveiled LAS VEGAS.” Unveiled gives press members an advanced look at what will be striking big over the actual show, which starts on Tuesday, January 8. This will give me an opportunity to get some information out to the iDB community even before the showroom floor opens later in the week.
* Monday is “Press Day” with many major companies, developers, and related electronic parties introducing new products or hosting panel discussions. My day will start with press breakfast and then the “Apps, Meet Cars” power session, which will expose the developing market of mobile applications that communicate and intertwine with automobiles’ infotainment systems.
* Throughout Press Day, I will hop in and out of different sessions covering new start ups to time-tested tech company giants like LG and Samsung. The goal of these early sessions is to get a press only look at new products before the show floor opens to the general public from Tuesday, January 8 to Friday, January 11.

* Having prepped to make the 3,000 mile trek across the US to Vegas, I set up several meetings with different companies throughout the show including Seagate, URBANEARS, TRENDnet, and Moshi. All of these companies will be releasing new products specifically tailored to iOS devices and I am very excited to get my hands on their new items.
* One evening, I will be attending Pepcom’s Digital Experience!, which is a packed room full of major electronic retailers ready to let attendees play with the newest gadgets. Some of the companies headed to Digital Experience! include Belkin, Kingston, Disney, Google, Ford, and Western Digital.
* Overall, the chance to go to CES is a bucket list opportunity for me. Even as a kid, I always kept a close watch on the show, getting what information I could from blogs and news coverage. This year will be my inaugural trip to the world’s largest consumer electronic convention and I could not be more excited. It is an honor to represent iDB and our community of engaged readers as I head into the show looking to gather as much information as possible.
* Make sure to check back frequently next week as I expand on my trip to tech heaven and my chance to hang out with our Editor-in-Chief, Sebastien. Throughout the week, I will be tweeting my whole trip to keep everyone updated. From packing the day prior to landing back in North Carolina, I will do my best to give up-to-the-minute updates via Twitter and post articles during the evening hours, once I return to my room after the show.
* Who is pumped for CES this year? What are you expecting to see or be announced?
