* If you’ve been experiencing problems with the iOS App Store this evening, you’re not alone. Users from around the world are reporting that they are having issues with downloading applications.
* At the moment, we’re having trouble getting the App Store to even load on our devices. And even when we are able to get apps to populate, trying to download them results in the above error…
* This doesn’t appear to be a small outage. TheNextWeb is reporting that it can confirm that users in the US, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia and Kuwait are all seeing the same thing.
* The reason behind the downed service is unknown. It’s possible that Apple is just performing server maintenance, but usually, it will give developers a heads-up before doing something large-scale. It’s also worth noting that the service went down around 10PM PST, an odd time to disable the App Store.
* The timing is certainly interesting though, given that Apple has been seeing a number of App Store problems over the past few weeks. First there was the DRM glitch that affected app updates, and more recently it’s been dealing with the in-app purchasing hack.
* At any rate, the service will likely be fully restored by tomorrow morning. And we’ll be sure to keep you updated with any comments from Apple on the situation.
* Have you had any problems with the App Store tonight?
