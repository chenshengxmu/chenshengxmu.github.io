title: Chitika- recent iOS 6 adoption spike due to China iPhone 5 launch

* Earlier this week, a report surfaced from MoPub, a mobile ad serving platform, suggesting that the recent release of Google Maps caused a 30% spike in iOS 6 user adoption. And of course, it made sense that some folks were holding out on updating until they were sure they’d have a proper Maps app.
* But what didn’t make sense was how far off MoPub’s findings were from Chitika’s. You see Chitika, another large ad network, also looked at iOS 6 user adoption after the Google Maps release, and it only saw a 0.2% bump. So why the huge discrepancy? It likely has to do with the firms’ coverage areas…
* Chitika suggests that the difference between the two reports could very well have something to do with their respective coverage areas. MoPub, for example, pulls its data from a global ad network. Chitika’s study, however, only covers devices that are currently active in the United States and Canada.
* What does all this have to do with iOS 6 adoption? Well remember, the iPhone 5 launched in 30+ countries last week — one of them being China, which saw iPhone 5 sales of 2+ million during opening weekend. And I’ll give you one guess what firmware came pre-installed on all of those iPhone 5s. Yup, iOS 6.
* So with that in mind, Chitika stands by its original report — that the Google Maps release didn’t really affect iOS 6 user adoption. It even took a new, longer-term look at its iOS device impression data in the US, and found that between December 11 and December 17, iOS 6 impressions were, again, fairly flat.
* Now, all of this may not mean much out of context. But it does let the air out of the tires of what seems to be a popular theory bouncing around the web that millions of users came running to iOS 6 once the Google Maps app arrived. It made for a nice story, but clearly, that just wasn’t the case.
* Chitika 1 MoPub 0.
