* The latest version of UltraSn0w has made its way to Cydia, and it supports the latest publicly available iPhone firmware, iOS 5.0.1.
* You will still need an unlockable baseband to utilize ultrasn0w, but if you meet the requirements, it is now possible to unlock your iPhone 4 or iPhone 3GS running iOS 5.0.1…
* You will need a jailbroken device to utilize UltraSn0w 1.2.5. Your baseband must also meet the following requirements:
* iPhone 4: baseband 01.59.00 iPhone 3GS: basebands 04.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, 06.15.00
* If you’re interested in preserving your baseband for the latest Apple firmware upgrade, you can follow our baseband preservation tutorial.
* This version of UltraSn0w doesn’t bring any new baseband compatibility to the table, and it only works with the iPhone 4 and 3GS. No iPhone 4S support just yet, but there are rumblings that support could be coming for those devices in the future.
* Are you running an unlocked iPhone using UltraSn0w?
