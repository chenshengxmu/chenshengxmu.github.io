* The rumored budget iPhone with a 6.1-inch LCD screen is expected to launch in multiple colors, according to influential analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and now a new report offers additional info.
* The fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara (Google Translate) corroborated Kuo’s report Wednesday, but added that the 6.1-inch LCD device will be offered in colors that are slightly different than what Kuo suggested and more in line with the color scheme of Apple’s iPhone leather case lineup.
* Here’s what Mac Otakara and Kuo predicted each, plus the original iPhone 5c colors and Apple’s leather and silicone case color scheme for comparison’s sake:
* Here’s the first TV commercial for iPhone 5c.
* iDownloadBlog also expects a gold model to be added to the iPhone X lineup this year.
* Seeing these colors, it would make sense to provide the upcoming budget LCD phone (it’s expected to retail for around $700) in color choices similar to those of the iPhone Leather Case lineup, just like they did with iPhone 5c and its accompanying first-party cases (Apple even color-matched the iOS wallpaper to the iPhone 5c color).
* What about PRODUCT(RED), you ask?
* As you can see, there’s no red on Mac Otakara’s or Kuo’s list but there’s a perfectly viable explanation for that. Apple, like many other smartphone manufacturers, leverages color as a marketing tool to boost sales of their flagship devices just as sales begin to drop in anticipation of upgraded models.
* In Apple’s case, they typically release a PRODUCT(RED) model after the lineup has been on sale for about six months. Adding a new color to the iPhone lineup mid-cycle generates a slew of all-new blog posts, news stories and YouTube videos that help re-new interest for the smartphone long after the initial wave of excitement has died down.
* For more on that, I suggest watching MKBHD’s video embedded above.
* Thoughts?
