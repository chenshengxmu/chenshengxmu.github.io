title: iOS 6 may bring iBooks to Apple TV
---
* Until now, Apple TV seemed to assume the role of livingroom entertainment center. However, the device may soon find a new home: the classroom. The latest beta of iOS 6 suggests Apple could display digital textbooks on large in-class screens, vastly updating how schools teach.

* The clue came in an error displayed when AppleInsider downloaded an e-book from Apple’s iBookstore. Since the Apple TV unit shared the same iTunes account, a message appeared that an automatic download of the book failed because the device did not have the needed software. The iBooks software already exists for the iPhone and iPad…
* “But those devices have access to the App Store and can download the iBooks application for automatic downloads of content, while the Apple TV cannot,” the blog explained.
* While it’s unlikely many people would read an e-book on their television screen, iBooks 2.0 introduced the concept of turning lifeless textbooks into interactive applications. Along with full-throated support from late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, interactive textbooks have gained government endorsements from US President Obama, the Department of Education and the Federal Communications Commission.
* Reshaping Apple TV into a classroom tool could breathe new life into the device. Apple executives recently said an iTV based on the device is unlikely, given the massive hurdles the Cupertino, Calif. company would face licensing content.
* What do you think? Will Apple TV become a big hit on campus? Or, is the error message just a bug needing squashing?
