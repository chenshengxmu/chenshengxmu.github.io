* An annoying bug that crashes your iPhone after a specific string of symbols and Arabic characters is received through iMessage or SMS from another party has been fixed in iOS 8.4 beta 4, as first reported by Italian blog HDBlog.it. The beta software was seeded to registered Apple developers two days ago. The iMessage crashing bug is tied to how iOS banner notifications process Unicode text.
* Apple has offered a temporary bandaid solution of sorts until a proper fix is delivered. iDownloadBlog has posted a few potential fixes of its own, too. That being said, the iOS 8.4 software update will squash this pesky bug for everyone when it arrives on June 30.
* That’s good news as the bug causes the phone to restring upon receiving the offending message, in some instances rendering your message archive inaccessible or freezing the Messages app altogether.
* Moreover, the software update will alsofix crashing in some popular third-party apps that handle strings of text, such as WhatsApp, Skype, Twitter and Snapchat.
* In addition to the iPhone, the vulnerability can crash your Mac and Apple Watch so we’re definitely expecting companion fixes for OS X Yosemite and watchOS.
* In addition to bug fixes, iOS 8.4 will be the first version of iOS with support for Apple Music, a $9.99 per month subscription streaming-music service announced Monday.
* Apple Music and iOS 8.4 are launching June 30, Apple said.
