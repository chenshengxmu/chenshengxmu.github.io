* Instagram just pushed out a new version of its iOS app, the first update following its $1 billion deal with Facebook.
* Instagram version 2.5 brings out half a dozen new features, including a revamped profiles tab, a brand new Explore section and the ability to share your likes to Facebook, to name a few.
* If anything, we now know Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was telling the truth when he promised to maintain Instagram as a standalone app.
* Full changelog and screenies after the break…
* If you prefer to manage your content updates across multiple social networks simultaneously, you will no doubt love the ability to share your Instagram likes on Facebook.
* To enable this feature, go to your Profile tab in the app, then tap Sharing Settings and then Facebook. Revamped profile tabs also look nice and the new Explore tab lets you browse hashtags and usernames. TechCrunch sees the Explore tab becoming the future of photo discovery, possibly letting you soon hone in on photos from specific times or locations.

* Another handy feature is autocomplete when searching for people you follow (the lack of it was seriously ticking me off).
* Cody Fink of the MacStories blog wrote in his review that the update “makes Instagram feel much more interactive” while bringing out features akin to Twitter clients, like autocomplete.
* Here, your full release notes for Instagram 2.5.
* – Revamped profile tab – Search for users and tags in the Explore tab – Improvements to commenting – User search autocompletes based on people you follow – Visual improvements – Speed optimizations – Optionally share likes to Facebook
* Last, but not the least, here’s a cool Instagram 2.5 trick, spotted by Keegan Jones: long-tap the camera button to access your camera roll.
* One thing missing?
* Still no pull to refresh.
* Ugh.
* Instagram is a free download right from the App Store.
* Did you stop using Instagram like Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller?
* And do you get all worked up over iOS exclusives going Android?
