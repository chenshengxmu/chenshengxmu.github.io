* Apple on Tuesday told The New York Times that it has signed up “dozens more banks, retail stores and start-ups to adopt Apple Pay” in recent weeks. The mobile payment service launched in October with a handful of official partners, and has been adding new ones on a near-weekly basis.
* This latest round of additions includes Associated Bank, BB&T, Commerce Bank, TD Bank North America, UW Credit Union and 5 other institutions. Apple says that with the new partners, Apple Pay now supports the cards that represent ~90% of the credit card purchase volume in the US.
* Apple also touted new retail partners in box-box office supplier Staples, which we were already aware of, and chain grocers Winn-Dixie and Albertsons. Starting on Friday, the Amway Center, home to the Orlando Magic, will begin accepting Apple Pay at many of its concession stands as well.
* Apple Pay has seen some significant success in its early months. Whole Foods says the service now accounts for 1% of all transactions, and it’s been reported to make up 50% of McDonald’s tap-to-pay transactions. Walgreens says mobile wallet payments have doubled since Apple Pay debuted.
