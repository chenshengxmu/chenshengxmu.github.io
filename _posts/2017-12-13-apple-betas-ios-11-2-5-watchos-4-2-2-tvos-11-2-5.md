* Apple on Wednesday afternoon seeded first betas of the upcoming software updates for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Apple Watch to its registered developers.
* This follows the first developer beta of macOS High Sierra 10.13.3, which dropped on Monday.
* The iOS 11.2.5 beta (build 15D5037e) is now available to registered developers via the Software Update mechanism in iOS Settings → General → Software Update on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Apple’s beta configuration profile installed.
* The watchOS 4.2.2 beta (build 15S5530d) can be installed on any Apple Watch model that runs an appropriate configuration profile, by tapping My Watch → General → Software Update in the companion Watch app on your paired iPhone (which must run the iOS 11.2.5 beta).
* The tvOS 11.2.5 beta (build 15K5531d) is available in tvOS Settings → System → Software Update on your fourth-generation Apple TV or Apple TV 4K, assuming your set-top box is using—you guessed right—Apple’s configuration profile.
* Configuration profiles for your particular hardware can be downloaded from Apple’s portal for developers (Apple developer registration is required before you’re allowed to download assets).
* Matching public betas should follow soon.
* Stay tuned as we’ll be making sure to tell you about any newsworthy changes in the new OS builds. For the sake of completeness, we found no new feature mentions in release notes.
