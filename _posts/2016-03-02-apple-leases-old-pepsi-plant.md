* According to The Silicon Valley Business Journal, Apple in November 2015 quietly leased a 96,000-square-foot site in Sunnyvale, California which used to be Pepsi’s bottling plant.
* Interestingly enough, this industrial property is located in the neighborhood of a complex of warehouses and offices which Apple leased about a year ago for purposes unknown to the public (hint: permits mention things like an “auto work area” and a “repair garage”).
* The ex-Pepsi bottling plant that Apple leased is located at 960 Kifer Road in Sunnyvale, California. Built in 1957, the property spans five acres and includes a warehouse-type industrial building, as well as truck docks in the back.
* The Apple lease was disclosed in a loan document on file with the county clerk’s office and filed on February 22, the paper reported.
* “City permit records aren’t much help; the only thing on file is for a seismic upgrade submitted in January,” reads the article. “That suggests that the building will remain and won’t be redeveloped.”
* In a Q&A with Fortune’s Adam Lashinsky, CEO Tim Cook suggested that Apple ultimately may decide not to make a car at all though he did hint that the company is “exploring” various “technologies” and “products” in general.
* Cook also had a very revealing response when asked about Apple’s rumored electric car project at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Cupertino, California, last Friday.
* “Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren’t sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while,” he said.
* Project Titan was headed by Apple’s Vice President of Product Design, Steve Zadesky, who recently left the company for personal reasons.
