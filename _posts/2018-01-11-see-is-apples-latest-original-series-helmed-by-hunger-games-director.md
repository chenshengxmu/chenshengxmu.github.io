* Apple continues its ingress to the world of original content with their latest straight-to-series order for See. An “epic, world building drama” from director of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Francis Lawrence
* Written by Steven Knight and directed by Francis Lawrence, this futuristic drama is just the latest project to join Apple’s ranks.
* Not much information is available yet, but Deadline reports that it will join other series like Amazing Stories, the space drama from Ronald D. Moore, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon’s network morning show drama, and more.
* We still don’t know Apple’s plans for their original series as they’ve largely remained silent on the matter.
* It was reported last year that Apple has invested $1 billion into producing original content, and hopefully we will start to see the fruits of those labors in the not-to-distant future.
* Let us know which of Apple’s upcoming shows has really peaked your interest, down in the comments.
