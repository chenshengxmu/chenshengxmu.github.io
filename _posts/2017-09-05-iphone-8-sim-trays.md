* iPhone 8 should include a new copper-like colorway (probably called Champagne Gold, Blush Gold or some such) and a pair of newly leaked SIM trays for the device appear to support this.
* Published Monday on leak aggregator SlashLeaks, the image seen top of post apparently shows two SIM trays for an iPhone, one in Apple’s standard Silver finish and the other in a pretty deep shade of Gold that I don’t think we’ve seen in an iPhone before.
* The OLED iPhone, as well as the the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models, should come in Silver, Gold and Black. However, only the flagship iPhone 8 model is expected to potentially provide additional color finishes such as the aforesaid Blush Gold.

* The images were originally shared by smartphone leaker Benjamin Geskin.
* Would you consider buying the next iPhone in Blush Gold?
* I’ll be going with the deepest black colorway available because any other finish is likely going to have a white front face and I don’t want that notch up the top of the OLED display to stand out.
