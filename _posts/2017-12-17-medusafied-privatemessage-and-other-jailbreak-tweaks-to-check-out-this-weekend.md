* The jailbreak community has been brimming with potential following the release of Ian Beer’s tfp0 exploit for iOS 11.1.2, but we’re not out of the woods yet. Fortunately, developers continue to release new and exciting tweaks for those still comfily jailbroken on iOS 10.
* In this roundup, we’ll discuss all the new jailbreak tweaks we’ve shown you throughout the last work week. As usual, we’ll begin by talking about our favorites in detail, and then we’ll outline the rest of them afterward.

* One of our favorites from this week was Medusafied, which enables several iPad-style multitasking features on unsupported devices like the iPhone and iPod touch.
* Among the things it unlocks are Slide Over and Split View, each of which helps make multitasking more efficient than the traditional App Switcher approach. Slide Over mode lets you move between recently-used apps more quickly, while Spit View enables you to use two apps side-by-side on the same screen.
* If you think multitasking lacks on the iPhone, then Medusafied is a tweak you really need to check out. Our full review goes in-depth concerning how it works and what it can do for you.

* PrivateMessage is an ingenious tweak that lets users lock individual chat bubbles inside the Messages app with Touch ID.
* Whether you want to keep someone who knows your passcode from snooping or you worry that someone might be glancing over your shoulder to see what you typed, PrivateMessage can help conceal any message or attachment you’ve sent or received. Best of all, PrivateMessage works with both iMessages and SMS messages, so the tweak is as user-friendly as it gets.
* You can learn more about PrivateMessage and why it’s so handy in our full review.
* 4000 Degrees Kelvin: Forces iOS to display temperature in Kelvin rather than Celsius or Fahrenheit (free via FESTIVAL’s repository – review)
* EQE: A systemwide parametric equalizer for iOS (free via BigBoss repository – review)
* Powerless: Disables the sound and vibration feedback when connecting your device to a power source (free via CydiaGeek’s repository – review)

* That just about wraps things up for this week’s roundup, but we’ll continue to keep you updated as new jailbreak tweaks surface. You might also consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope.
