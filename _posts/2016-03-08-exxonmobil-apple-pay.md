* Oil giant ExxonMobil is rolling out support for Apple Pay to 6,000 gas stations within its Speedpass+ app for the iPhone and iPad. The in-app feature lets customers pay for fuel at the pump with their iPhone by selecting Apple Pay as a payment option. Availability will reach more than 8,000 Exxon- and Mobil-branded stores by mid-year, said the company.
* “The app enables customers to authorize a pump for payment securely through the use of cloud-based technology,” explains ExxonMobil. Customers can elect to have Apple Pay as a default form of payment from within the app and continue to receive all of the rewards and benefits offered by their credit and debit cards.
* You can obtain receipts by email, at the pump, or both, and access your purchase history in the app or use the software to find nearby stores enabled for mobile payment.
* The app may also be linked to checking accounts or other major credit and debit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and ExxonMobil cards.
* Speedpass+ for iOS is available at no charge in the App Store.
