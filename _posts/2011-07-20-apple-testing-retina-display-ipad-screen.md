* The rumor mill is in full swing these days, with claims that Apple will be launching an iPad 3 with a Retina Display.
* The latest information comes from The Korea Times, who believe that Apple is currently testing screen technology from both LG and Samsung, with a 2048 x 1536 screen expected for the next iPad to come out of Cupertino…
* “Apple’s upcoming iPad 3 will feature an improved display to support quad extended graphics (QXGA), a display resolution of 2048 × 1536 pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio to provide full high definition (HD) viewing experience. The imminent deals would assure that Samsung and LG continue to be the biggest providers of flat screens to Apple for the foreseeable future. Samsung and LG are two of the few LCD makers that are at ease with highly-advanced LCD screens.”
* 9to5Mac adds that this isn’t the first time a high-resolution iPad display has been discussed. Both IDG and Digitimes have suggested that the next iPad could come with a screen packing a huge number of pixels.
* Of course, with The Korea Times citing “a source close to the talks,” this rumor should obviously be taken with a grain of salt.
* Both LG and Samsung currently use a technology called “low temperature polysilicon,” which could meet the 280 pixels-per-inch required by Apple for a Retina Display screen.
* Rumors abound that Apple will introduce an iPad HD later this year, sporting the same 2048 x 1536 resolution mentioned by the The Korea Times. Could the two rumors be one and the same, perhaps?
* The iPad HD talk also includes new ‘pro’ apps, aimed at taking advantage of the increased screen real estate afforded by such a screen.
* What would you like to see a 9.7 inch, 2048 x 1536 screen used for?
