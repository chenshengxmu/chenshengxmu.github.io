title: Rumor- Retina Display iPad to Launch in February
---
* Citi analyst Richard Gardner claims in a note to clients today that the iPad 3 (or whatever its name may be) will launch in February of 2012 and will feature a Retina display:
* According to “several sources” the next iPad will launch in February, and it will sport a screen with double the resolution of the current model.
* As usual, these analysts’ predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, as they rarely rely on any evidence. But looking at the past two years, it seems clear that the next iPad will probably launch between February and April.
