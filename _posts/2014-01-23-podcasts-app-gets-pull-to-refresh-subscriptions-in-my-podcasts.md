* Apple has issued a maintenance update to its Podcasts app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. The new 2.0.1 edition, now available free in the App Store, brings a handy pull to refresh feature allowing you to pull down on the My Subscriptions screen in order to manually refresh your subscriptions. Additionally, this version of Podcasts brings a few other fixes, listed right after the break…
* Podcasts 2.0.1 resolves an issue that may cause playback to stop unexpectedly, which has happened to me a lot.
* It also fixes a problem where subscriptions may stop updating with new episodes (haven’t encountered this issue) and of course includes “additional improvements to overall stability”.
* iTunes release notes mention no other changes aside from the aforementioned refinements.
* Grab Podcasts 2.0.1 free in the App Store.
