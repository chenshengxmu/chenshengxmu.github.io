Whether you’re at home, in the office or on the go, your notes travel with you. And you can share your notes and collaborate with others, across multiple devices!
* Recent updates include: • Beautifully redesigned for iOS 7 • Photos of whiteboards and documents are now auto-cropped and enhanced

* You can find the new version of Microsoft OneNote for iPad in the App Store, for free.
