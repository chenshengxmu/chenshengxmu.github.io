* Although some people have no problem with snapping selfies and carrying out FaceTime Video calls with their friends or colleagues, some people simply aren’t happy with the way they look and are more self-conscious about how folks will judge their character.
* SelfieTime is a new jailbreak tweak by veteran iOS developer Elias Limneos that can help people of the latter group look better for their selfies and feel more confident during FaceTime Video calls.
* The tweak utilizes real-time face-tracking to accommodate the user with professional face-smoothing filters. The options are user-configurable right from the stock Camera app’s user interface, so you don’t have to install any third-party apps to take advantage of these features.

* Among the things you can adjust from the Camera app’s UI are:
* Because everything occurs in real-time, you get to see how all the effects impact your face as you change them.
* Worthy of note, the tweak supports all native photo filters in the Camera app, so you don’t have to pick between Apple’s appearance options and SelfieTime’s face-smoothing characteristics. You should also know that SelfieTime works fabulously in all native Camera modes, whether you’re messing around in Photo mode, Square mode, Live Photos, or Video.
* Even if you’ve just woke up and exhibit those unsightly dark bags under your eyes, crow’s feet at the sides, or that five-o-clock shadow because you forgot to shave the night before, SelfieTime comes in clutch and makes you look marvelous to the receiving end.
* If you were interested in how all of this works, the developer made a demo video that we’ve embedded for your convenience below:
* SelfieTime adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure few options:

* Here, you can turn the tweak on or off independently for the Camera app and for the FaceTime app. You can also restore the tweak to its default settings with the button at the bottom of the page. No respring is needed to save your changes.
* I don’t get very excited about selfies or FaceTime Video calls myself because I find them eerily creepy, but if you enjoy them and think the face-smoothing features of SelfieTime are appropriate for you, then the tweak is available from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $2.49.
* Limneos notes that SelfieTime works on jailbroken devices running iOS 8, 9, and 10. It also supports the iPhone 5 and later, although current devices process the face-smoothing effects more fluidly because of the nature of the real-time processing and the speed constraints of the chips in older phones.
