* Back in 2013, iOS developer Elias Limneos surprised the jailbreak community when he released one of the world’s first live voice changer jailbreak tweaks for the iPhone. VoiceChanger allowed you to have some fun with your phone calls by adjusting the pitch of your voice in real-time. Unfortunately, it was never updated for iOS 11.
* But that all changed this week following the release of VoiceChanger X. Now, you can re-live the same entertainment you may have experienced in 2013 on your pwned iOS 11 handset.
* As you might be able to tell from the screenshot examples above, Limneos built the VoiceChanger X interface directly into the phone call interface to make real-time adjustments a cinch.
* From the VoiceChanger X menu, you can adjust your vocal pitch between five presets, including:
* The presets are great, but even if they don’t float your boat, VoiceChanger X gives you the option to set your own pitch manually.
* You can visit the Settings app after installing VoiceChanger X to configure to the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* VoiceChanger X is a great prank tweak, but you may not use it every day. That said, the tweak isn’t for everyone, but those with a sense of humor may want to give it a shot.
* If you’re interested in trying VoiceChanger X, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. You’ll be required to submit a $1.99 payment via the tweak’s preference pane after installation to activate it.
* VoiceChanger X works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices and plays nicely with the stock Phone app, FaceTime app, and even some third-party VoIP apps like Facebook Messenger, Skype, and WhatsApp to name a few. Additionally, the tweak works well with more of Limneos’ tweaks, such as AnsweringMachine X and CallBar X.
