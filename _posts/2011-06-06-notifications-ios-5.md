* In the months leading up to Apple’s WWDC event, push notifications seemed to be at the top of every iPhone user’s wish lists for features to get revamped in iOS 5. In the last few weeks, we’ve seen a lot of evidence that Apple was looking to do just that.
* Well the wait is over folks as Steve Jobs and company have taken the stage at WWDC to unveil the latest version of iOS, and once again Apple has not disappointed. Enter the new Notifications Center, which happens to look a lot like MobileNotifier…
* The jailbreak utility known as MobileNotifier and the mastermind behind it, Peter Hajas, have received a lot of attention over the last few weeks. The way iOS used to handle notifications was so poor that it had a lot of folks looking for an alternative.
* Well following the news that Hajas has been hired on by the Cupertino company, it’s no surprise that Apple’s new notifications system for iOS looks remarkably like the jailbreak tweak.
* You get all kinds of notifications on your iOS device: new email, texts, friend requests, and more. With Notification Center, you can keep track of them all in one convenient location. Just swipe down from the top of any screen to enter Notification Center. Choose which notifications you want to see. Even see a stock ticker and the current weather. New notifications appear briefly at the top of your screen, without interrupting what you’re doing. And the Lock screen displays notifications so you can act on them with just a swipe. Notification Center is the best way to stay on top of your life’s breaking news.
* Notification no longer interrupt you like the blue boxes of the past. They now displayed across the top of the screen, and are accessible by swiping down from the status bar.

* Notifications are now viewable from the lock screen as well. Swiping across a notification will launch you into the corresponding app, much like Notifications Pro does with the GriP Bar.
* It seems like Apple really hit the nail on the head with the new Notification Center. Stay tuned to see what else iOS 5 brings in the way of new and revamped features.
