* Yesterday, I let you in on a trick to selectively show or hide unwanted app icons from your Apple TV’s Home screen. Today, I want to talk about another great Apple TV enhancement, one just implemented as part of the newly-released Apple TV 6.0 software update: tap-to-setup. In a nutshell, you can now use an iOS device to quickly set up your $99 hockey puck.
* Sure, the third-generation Apple TV does allow for greater flexibility by letting folks pair a Bluetooth keyboard in order to quickly type in any pertinent information during the setup procedure (or afterwards). Tap-to-setup, however, takes easy to the next level by automatically transferring common settings from your iOS device…
* Specifically, tap-to-setup carries Wi-Fi network and password, iTunes Store account credentials and language/region format preferences over from your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad to the third-generation Apple TV (older models aren’t supported). Don’t worry, none of this will mess up your iOS device preferences.
* Before we begin, a quick notice: you must be running the latest Apple TV 6.0 software and iOS 7 on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It really does work like a charm, let me show you how in five easy steps.
* STEP 1: Hook up an Apple TV to your living room telly and power it up.
* STEP 2: Unlock your iOS 7 device and ensure that Bluetooth is enabled (you can quickly access the Bluetooth toggle by pulling up Control Center on the Lock screen). Also important: both your Apple TV and iOS 7 device must be connected to the Wi-Fi network you want to use with the set-top box.
* STEP 3: Bring your iOS device within 10 to 15 feet of the Apple TV until a prompt pops up asking you to enter your Apple ID credentials on an iOS device in order to commence the Automatic Setup procedure.

* STEP 4: As you can see on the screenies below, upon typing in your Apple ID account credentials (left), you can tell the set-top box to remember that Apple ID for iTunes Store purchases (middle) and send diagnostic data to Apple (right).

* STEP 5: The Apple TV should wrap up Automatic Setup by connecting to a Wi-Fi network, activating itself, seting up your iTunes Store account and making other configuration changes pertinent to your iOS device.

* Voilà – your Apple TV is now ready to use!
* It couldn’t be simpler, no?
* Here’s Jeff’s video walkthrough, based on an Apple TV beta firmware.
* This is definitely a great time-saver compared to having to tediously spell out information using Apple’s clumsy remote and on-screen keyboard. Heck, it even beats the Apple TV set up process using a Bluetooth keyboard.
* Keep in mind that tap-to-setup only configures your Wi-Fi network, iTunes Store account and region/language settings.
* Consequentially, you are still required to manually set up third-party services such as Netflix, YouTube or Hulu Plus, approve Apple’s free Remote iOS app, provide iTunes Match/Home Sharing/iCloud Photos credentials, set up multiple Wi-Fi networks or install network configuration profiles.

* Again, this handy feature works only on the third-generation Apple TV powered by the new Apple TV 6.0 software or later. Tap-to-setup is compatible with the iPhone 4s or later, third-generation iPad or later, iPad mini and fifth-generation iPod touch. The feature is not available on the iPhone 4, iPad 2 and older devices.
* Apple’s support document details the whole process and provides handy troubleshooting instructions.
* According to AppleInsider, this might be the first public deployment of Apple’s new iBeacons communications standard.

* As a quick reminder, iBeacons is a new iOS 7 feature that enhance apps’ location awareness via Bluetooth LE profile, the power-sipping wireless technology, whilst enabling a series of new geofencing capabilities for app developers.
* Your iOS 7 device combined with inexpensive Bluetooth LE “beacons” opens door to a whole new world of possibilities, like in-store offers, micro-location door activation and indoor navigation, location-based marketing and Passbook tickets and more.

* Some even speculate the iBeacons technology could pave the way to a contactless mobile payment system from Apple. If anything, this how-to is a nice example of how iBeacons already makes your life easier.
* So, how did you like Apple TV’s tap-to-setup trick?
* Give it a whirl yourself and let me know what you guys think down in the comments.
