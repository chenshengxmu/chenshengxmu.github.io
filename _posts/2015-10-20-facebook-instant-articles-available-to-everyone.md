* After rolling out Instant Articles to a tiny subset of its 1.3 billion active user base back in May of this year, the social networking leader Facebook today said these quick-loading articles are available to all users of its mobile application for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* Thousands of Instant Articles, each denoted with a lightning bolt in the top right corner of the News Feed story, will be available at launch and more will be added on a regular basis. Facebook claims Instant Articles load up to ten times faster than a standard mobile web article.
* If you’ve ever used Facebook’s US-only Paper app, you have a pretty good idea of the polish provided by Instant Articles and their support for rich media such as photos and video and other embeddable content types like multitouch maps and more.
* What’s more, the Paper app’s features like tilt-to-pan photos, auto-play video, embedded audio captions and more are now part of Instant Articles, too.
* When someone shares a link on Facebook, the platform will automatically display an enhanced experience if an Instant Article version is available. “Instant Articles are simply the articles already in your Facebook News Feed, made faster and more beautiful,” said Facebook.
* Based on their limited beta-test of Instant Articles with a small group of people on Facebook for iPhone, the company has noticed that the enhanced experience results in more shared Instant Articles compared to their standard web counterparts.
* Some examples of Instant Articles include:
* More publishers will be jumping on the Instant Articles bandwagon in the next few weeks, including Billboard, Billy Penn, The Blaze, Bleacher Report, Breitbart, Brit + Co, Business Insider, Bustle, CBS News, CBS Sports, CNET, Complex, Country Living, Cracked, Daily Dot, E! News, Elite Daily, Entertainment Weekly, Gannett, Good Housekeeping, Fox Sports, Harper’s Bazaar, Hollywood Life, Hollywood Reporter, IJ Review, Little Things, Mashable, Mental Floss, mindbodygreen, MLB, MoviePilot, NBA, NY Post, The Onion, Opposing Views, People, Pop Sugar, Rare, Refinery 29, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, TIME, Uproxx, US Magazine, USA Today, Variety, The Verge and The Weather Channel.
* Instant Articles for Android will launch later this year. To learn more about Instant Articles, go to Facebook’s micro-site.
