* Apple is constantly adding new stores around the globe. Frequently, Apple creates a marketing scheme to celebrate the new additions. In Tokyo, the marketing scheme surrounded a green wall that is adorned with plants, as a climate controlled wall to help regulate indoor temperatures. With the new feature in mind, Apple created a very green and leafy cover board and art to coincide with the store opening. We featured several wallpaper versions that were inspired by Apples green friendly design and many readers enjoyed the art.
* Today, the same artist is back at it, with a wallpaper set highlighting the most recent June 21 opening in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol…
* The same graphic artist submitted these new dotted wallpapers to celebrate the store opening. @JasonZigrino, hosts his work on Deviant Art, and often previews his downloads on Twitter. Desktop, iPhone and iPad images of the speckled wallpaper are included. This is in response to several readers requesting a download that includes both iPad and desktop versions, in addition to iPhone.
