* Over the past few weeks, jailbreak developers have been churning out custom widgets for the new iOS 5 Notification Center like crazy. Even though the new software is still in beta, the jailbreak community has already hacked it and created a variety of new tweaks.
* The most recent one to surface comes from developer Manuel Gebele. Surprisingly enough, it’s called WeeFacebook and it gives you a window into your social networking account from the Notification Center…
* The WeeFacebook widget allows you to access your account to view status updates and check-ins, along with a few other Facebook features. The downside? It can’t be installed via Cydia.
* Luckily, we have a brief tutorial for you on how to download it. So if you’re on iOS 5, jailbroken and feeling froggy, let’s leap:
* Step 1. Download this .deb file via mobile Safari on your iDevice
* Step 2. Open up the .deb file with iFile and select the Installer option.
* Step 3. Make sure you are logged into Facebook by visiting the Facebook site on your iDevice via mobile Safari
* Step 4. Once you have signed in, respring your device. WeeFacebook should now be functioning in your Notification Center
* For folks who don’t have iFile, you can still download the above .deb file and follow our tutorial on how to install .deb files via SSH. The iFile method is just much more simple.
* The jailbreak community is still holding vigilante to see if Apple opens up the Notification Center framework up to 3rd party developers. If they don’t, custom widgets would quickly become a headlining reason to jailbreak.
* What do you think? Have you tried WeeFacebook yet?
