* AT&T kickstarted some controversy last month when it announced that customers would have to switch to one of its Shared data plans to utilize iOS 6’s new FaceTime over Cellular feature.
* But it looks like if this is a deal-breaker for you, you can head over to Verizon. The carrier has just confirmed that FaceTime over Cellular will work with any of its available data plans…
* The Wall Street Journal reports:
* “Verizon Wireless is including use of Apple Inc.’s FaceTime video-calling feature over its cellular network on all of its data plans, as opposed to rival AT&T Inc.
* The application has been available for use over Wi-Fi connections, but the latest version of Apple’s operating system will allow for use over cellular networks. All Verizon Wireless customers will be permitted to use the data-intensive application with no additional charges, including those remaining on unlimited data plans, according to a company spokeswoman.”
* Unfortunately, there is an underlying caveat here. We’ve confirmed with Verizon that customers will not be allowed to keep their unlimited data plans when upgrading to the iPhone 5.
* In fact, the only way to get an iPhone 5 and keep your unlimited plan with Verizon will be to buy one at full retail price. AT&T, for its part, has said that it will allow customers to keep their plans.
* So it’s kind of a “six of one, half a dozen of the other” situation here. Both carriers have their drawbacks, and it’ll be interesting to see who fairs better this fall amidst all of the iPhone 5 frenzy.
* What do you think?
