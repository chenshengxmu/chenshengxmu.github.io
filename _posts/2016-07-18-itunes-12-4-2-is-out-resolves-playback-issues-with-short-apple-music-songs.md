* Following the release of the OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 software update with bug fixes and security enhancements earlier this morning, Apple also released a minor update to iTunes. Now available through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab, iTunes 12.4.2 for Mac and Windows fixes an issue which caused an annoying issue with Apple Music tracks shorter than 60 seconds.
* “This update resolves a playback issue with short Apple Music songs in your Up Next queue,” writes Apple in iTunes 12.4.2 release notes.
* In addition, iTunes 12.4.2 for Windows, a direct download from Apple, provides fixes for three additional bugs, one of which could lead to disclosure of user information.
* For detailed information about changes in iTunes 12.4.2 for Windows, see this support doc.
