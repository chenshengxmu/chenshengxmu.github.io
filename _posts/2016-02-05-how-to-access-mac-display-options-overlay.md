* In addition to adjusting the screen resolution and choosing between the available display modes on your Mac, OS X’s System Preferences application gives you additional display options to play with.
* If you use display zoom, a great feature for people with less than perfect eyesight who find themselves squinting at the screen all the time, or you want to quickly access common features related to making items on the screen easier to see and the display easier to read, use the following time-saving shortcut to quickly adjust these options.
* Simply press the Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – F5 combination on the keyboard to bring up a cool Accessibility Options overlay for quickly setting common options related to Zoom, VoiceOver, Mouse and Keyboard and more.

* In the righthand section, scroll all the way to the bottom until you see an option labeled “Show Accessibility controls”. You can now change the default Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – F5 keyboard combination to a combo that suits your workflow.

* Simply click the shortcut shown and then record a new one by pressing any combination of keys on the keyboard. A message will warn you if your new shortcut is already in use. After recording a new shortcut for showing the Accessibility Display overlay, close the System Preferences window and try it out to see how it works.
* As I said, a richer set of Mac display options than are provided via this overlay are scattered throughout various places within the Accessibility pane of the System Preferences application.
