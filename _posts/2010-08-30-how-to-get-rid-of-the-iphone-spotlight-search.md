* How often do you use the Spotlight search on your iPhone? If you’re like me, you never ever use it. Even worse, I get annoyed by it as I often end up on the Spotlight screen while browsing through apps. No more of this!
* NoSpot is a new application available in Cydia that will get rid of Spotlight by hiding it from your screen. It’s easy, simple, and free!
* NoSpot will not add any icon to your springboard. It will just hide the Spotlight search.
* Try it and tell us what you think!
