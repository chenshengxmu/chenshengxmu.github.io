* Google has just updated its Play Movies & TV client for the iPhone and iPad with offline support, accessibility improvements and bug fixes, the Internet giant announced in a Google+ post Monday morning.
* “With Google Play’s updated iOS Play Movies & TV app, you can download movies and TV shows then take them with you wherever you go, no Internet connection required,” reads the post.
* Released this January, the free application (which now sits at version 1.2) continues to lack the ability to purchase movies and television shows on Google Play due to Apple’s rules for iOS development.
* To buy or rent movies, you’ll need to visit Google Play Store on any computer. Taking advantage of new iOS 7 features, media downloads run in the background so you can go on with your work while the device retrieves movies and TV shows marked for offline playback.
* Note that streaming and downloading video currently works over Wi-Fi connections only. Regional restrictions apply as some TV shows on the Play store are available in select markets only.

* The app also supports Google’s $35 Chromecast HDMI dongle. Google’s other Play store-enabled iOS software includes Play Books and Play Music clients.
* Google Play Movies & TV 1.2 changelog:
* [App Store via Google Play on Google+]
