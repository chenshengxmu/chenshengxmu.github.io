* Here, in case you’ve been wondering why Apple shipped buggy iOS Maps… Come on, you knew this was coming. I’d bet my shirt that Conan O’Brien will be next to diss Apple’s crappy maps. Can you say Mapgate?
* Oh, and CounterNotions has an amusing FAQ on Apple Maps.
* More Apple-related Joy of Tech comics right here.
* I also like this tweet.
* Bad news for those who ordered the iPhone 5. The delivery guys are using iOS maps to try to find your house.

* By the way, Google Maps is not a be-all-end-all navigation solution.
* Matter of fact, Nokia Maps drives circles around Apple and Google.
