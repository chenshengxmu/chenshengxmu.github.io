* Minutes ago, Apple updated iTunes to version 10.4.1. Apple initially released iTunes 10.4 to bring full screen support in Lion to its media software.
* Version 10.4.1 of iTunes doesn’t bring much but the usual bug fixes. We have the full change log below…
* I updated to the latest version and can confirm that it is safe for jailbroken devices.
* You can update directly via iTunes or by downloading from Apple’s website.
