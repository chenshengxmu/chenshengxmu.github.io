* Apple today previewed tvOS 12, the next major version of its living room operating system designed for enjoying digital entertainment on your big screen TV. The upgraded software will release some time this fall alongside other OS updates as a free update for your Apple TV.
* Aside from supporting the latest and greatest Apple TV 4K hardware, tvOS 12 will continue to run just fine on your fourth-generation Apple TV. And just like with prior tvOS editions, the tvOS 12 update will not support your third-generation Apple TV models or earlier.
