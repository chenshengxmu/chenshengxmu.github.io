* Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a staunch Google Chrome advocate for basically two reasons: a) It’s incredibly easy it is to restore all of your bookmarks, history, and extensions. And b). The OmniBar.
* The OmniBar is the feature that I always end up missing the most when I’m forced to use another browser. The OmniBar is great, because it does something incredibly simple: It lets you perform searches and web queries from within the same box.
* Safari UniBar is a jailbreak tweak that brings this same functionality to the iPhone’s Mobile Safari…
* The best jailbreak tweaks are generally always the simplest, most straightforward ideas, and Safari UniBar is no exception.
* It’s as simple as all get out, but this tweak has immediately leaped frogged into my top tweaks of all time discussion, just like that.
* What about you? Are you finding Safari UniBar as great as I am?
