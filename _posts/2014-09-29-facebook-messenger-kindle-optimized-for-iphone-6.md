* Although Apple’s new iPhones have been in stores for more than a week now and developers are scrambling to update their apps with native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* And while users are still waiting for an iPhone 6 optimized edition of WhatsApp, the social networking giant Facebook has now updated the Messenger iOS app with native iPhone 6 support.
* Another important piece of software has also received its iPhone 6-focused refresh today, Amazon’s Kindle for the iPhone and iPad. Both Facebook Messenger and Amazon Kindle are available free of charge in the App Store.
* If you’re a proud owner of the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you may have noticed that the apps that have not yet been refreshed for the new iPhone resolutions look a bit fuzzy when scaled up to fill the whole screen.
* “Now updated for iPhone 6,” read release notes accompanying the 38.8-megabyte Messenger 13.0 download. A month ago, another Messenger update has fixed a security flaw which forced users’ iPhones to place expensive calls automatically, racking up a large service bill.
* Messaging features are no longer available in Facebook’s main mobile client as the company focuses on turning Messenger into the ultimate messaging solution. If you’re a Facebook Messenger fan, take it for a spin on your tablet — the app takes full advantage of the iPad’s bigger canvas.

* As for Kindle, the latest version 4.5.1 includes the iPhone 6 support as well as bug fixes and stability improvements. Less than 24 hours following iOS 8’s public release, Amazon was among the first to refresh its app with a nice Today widget within the iOS 8 Notification Center, as seen on the screenshot below.

* Featuring note exporting, Wikipedia integration and other cool features, the 40.5-megabyte Kindle app runs on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad supported by iOS 7.0 or later. And if you live in the Amazon world, their new all-you-can-eat $9.99 per month Kindle Unlimited e-book and audiobook plan may be of interest to you.
* Apple maintains a running list of “Apps & Games for iPhone 6” on the App Store so give it a quick look to determine if your favorite apps feature native iPhone 6 support.
* [App Store: Kindle and Facebook Messenger]
