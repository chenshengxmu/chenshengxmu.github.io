* Jeremy Horwitz of 9to5Mac had a chance to play with Harman’s novel CarPlay solution at CES 2015 which ditches touchscreen-based interactions in favor of a steering wheel-mounted touchpad.
* Harman, which designs and sells audio and infotainment equipment, says its Integrated Essentials Cockpit is noteworthy as it doesn’t render UI on an in-car display like other CarPlay systems, but rather puts it in the dashboard directly behind the steering wheel.
* Such an approach could be viewed as better compared to touchscreen-based CarPlay systems for a number of reasons, yet isn’t without its pitfalls.
* Not only does the driver need not glance towards the middle of the car for touchscreen interactions, but can interact with CarPlay using a touchpad built into the steering wheel.
* An example photo top of post shows how Harman positions the CarPlay interface between a left-side speedometer and a right-side tachometer. As you can see for yourself, the layout even puts the current temperature above the CarPlay UI while the remaining fuel indicator is below it.
* The integrated solution may even help mitigate the risk of a faulty CarPlay connection breaking speedometer or odometer functionality compared to rival CarPlay systems.
* “If CarPlay crashes or hangs, everything else continues to run properly,” the author writes.

* I’m sure many people will appreciate the convenience of having everything related to driving and CarPlay conveniently placed in the dashboard behind the steering wheel, but I’m not one of them.
* It’s a tad overwhelming to have all those CarPlay icons and the UI so close to the speedometer and tachometer. I could be wrong of course, but it just seems to me that it takes away focus from the context of driving.
* Maybe I’m just old-fashioned, but infotainment wants to be mounted in the middle of the car, not behind the steering wheel.
* What say you?
* Does Harman’s use of CarPlay distract from driving?
