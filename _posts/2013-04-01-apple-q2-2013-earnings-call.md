* It looks like folks wondering how Apple did financially last quarter will find out in just a few short weeks. The Cupertino company announced this afternoon that it will be releasing its financial results for Q2 2013 on April 23.
* Apple’s earnings reports are typically a major affair in the tech world, and this one is particularly important. The iPad-maker’s stock is at its 52 week low, and it needs to post some big numbers to change the conversation…
* But, as we found out in Q1 of this year, it’s going to be hard to impress Wall Street. Apple posted record numbers for the holiday quarter, selling 47.8M iPhones, 22.9M iPads, for $54.5B in revenue, and its stock dropped 6%.
* And it’s going to be especially tough this time around. Apple’s decision to refresh most of its product lines last fall left us without any new product announcements (besides 128GB iPad) during the company’s fiscal 2nd quarter.
* Apple’s Q2 conference call is slated to begin on Tuesday, April 23 at 2pm PST. And as usual, we will be providing full coverage of the call including financial results, announcements and other highlights. So make sure to tune in.
