* Samsung is looking to pre-empt Apple’s expected monster upgrade cycle stemming from pent-up demand for a cutting-edge iPhone with a new Plus-branded Galaxy smartphone, as was previously rumored. Likely named Galaxy S8+, it should have an iris scanner and a 6.2-inch AMOLED screen with a Quad HD+ 3,200-by-1,800 pixel resolution.
* That’s according to prolific leakster Evan Blass.
* Among other features, iPhone 8 may support AR and 3D image capture/modeling via an improved FaceTime camera and use two-step biometric authentication combining either an iris scanner or 3D facial recognition and a Touch ID fingerprint reader embedded into the display. It’s been inferred from a recent KGI report that iPhone 8’s 5.8-inch 521 PPI AMOLED display should feature an active display area of about 5.1 inches with a native resolution of 2,800-by-1,242 pixels and the content area of 2,436-by-1,125 pixels.
* Blass leaked out the supposed Galaxy S8 specs sheet, which states that the handset’s screen will measure 6.2 inches diagonally, or 6.1 inches with the rounded corners. It should include 64 gigabytes of onboard storage, a twelve-megapixel Dual Pixel rear camera, an eight-megapixel front-facing selfie camera and a headphone jack.
* The Android-driven phone is said to be IP68-rated water and dust resistance and ship with Samsung’s earphones “tuned by AKG”.  Leaked specs suggest that wireless charging will require an optional charging pad accessory, sold separately.
* Recall, if you will, a recent Mac Otakara report stating that iPhone 8’s wireless charging would be an optional feature requiring the purchase of a standalone wireless charger.
* Although Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the governing body behind the ubiquitous Qi charging standard, Reuters said today that Apple still has at least five different groups working on wireless charging technologies.

* Separately, Blass said the next Galaxy should be the first smartphone out of the gate with the new Snapdragon 835 processor. If history is an indication, some versions of the phone could run Samsung’s own Exynos chip.
* For what it’s worth, Samsung just announced its latest chip, the Exynos 9 Series 8895.
* The South Korean company’s first processor built using 10-nanometer FinFET process technology with improved 3D transistor structure, it allows up to 27 percent higher performance while consuming 40 percent less power vs 14-nanometer technology.
* It integrates an LTE modem supporting five carrier aggregation (5CA) to deliver data throughput at up to 1 Gbps (Cat.16) downlink with 5CA and 150 Mbps (Cat.13) uplink with 2CA. The chip is comprised of four of Samsung’s second-generation custom CPU cores and four Cortex-A53 cores.

* There’s also an embedded co-processor for secure mobile payments and biometric authentication, as well as an embedded Vision Processing Unit (VPU) for computer vision, improved video tracking and panoramic image processing.
* Lastly, the new Exynos runs ARM’s latest Mali-G71 GPU designed for 4K virtual reality and gaming experiences and uses a multi-format codec for video capture and playback at a maximum resolution of 4K UHD at 120 frames per second.
* The chip’s in mass production now, meaning it could make its way into the next Galaxy.
* Are you impressed with these Galaxy S8+ specs?
* If you ask me, its basically an S7 Edge with an iris scanner added.
