* As the iPad 3 launch comes closer this Spring, retailer Meijer has dropped the price of the iPad 2 by $70, to $429. Meijer will be offering the deal from February 12 – 18 according to one ad, and February 12 – 25 according to the listing of the iPad 2 on Meijer’s website.
* Meijer will also be offering $5 off of the iPad 2’s Smart Cover and a free $15 iTunes Gift Card with the purchase of a $195 iPod touch…

* $70 off of the iPad 2 is certainly a pretty good deal. Best Buy and other retailers are known for only taking roughly $45 off, and Apple only took $41 off during its Black Friday sale. Granted, with the iPad 3 approaching you might think twice before purchasing an iPad 2.
* The iPad 3 is rumored to be announced during the first week of March, with a launch shortly after. It’s rumored to rock a Retina display, larger battery, and A6 processor.
