* Back in April, I told you about Expedia’s interesting promotion which provides free iOS apps through the official Expedia Hotels & Flights travel app, a free download for the iPhone and iPad.
* The company kickstarted the promotion by giving away premium travel apps and now they’re giving away Rayman Fiesta Run, Ubisoft’s colorful, fast-paced endless runner.
* Here’s how you can redeem the offer and download the game free from within the Expedia app…
* To get started, fire up the Expedia app and tap on Trips to enter your personal travel profile. Next, hit Extras to see what’s new in the Media Lounge – this is where your free, discounted and paid apps get listed.
