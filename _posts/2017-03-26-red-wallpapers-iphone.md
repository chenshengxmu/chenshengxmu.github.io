* With the launch of the new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone, we have seen more and more red pop up in social media exchanges. Previously, we posted a specific wallpaper set directly inspired by the new device. Friday, the new device launched are we are very excited about the new colorway. Our Wallpaper of the Week section tries to promote relevant photo quality images and this Sunday, we continue with the red theme.
* Our wallpapers category is populated with images sourced from different internet hubs, but also by our iDB fanbase. If you find some photo quality images that make great wallpapers, send them my way, or just follow along for the ride @jim_gresham.
