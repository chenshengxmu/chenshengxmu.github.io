* Apple just released iOS 8.4.1 to the public. If you’re jailbroken, it’s highly recommended that you stay away from this update. We’ll post an update once we have details of what the iOS 8.4.1 release contains, but rumors have swirled for weeks that it may fix the exploits used for the latest iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4 jailbreak.
* So far, we have not found any indication that this is so, but hold off just in case if you’re interested in jailbreaking. If you’re not interested in jailbreaking, feel free to update.

* It’s been nearly a month since the original iOS 8.4.1 beta was released to developers, and almost two weeks since iOS 8.4.1 beta 2 was released. Apple declined to include release notes outlining what those beta releases contained. Now that the 8.4.1 release is public, proper release notes have been included.
* Here is the change log for iOS 8.4.1:
* iOS 8.4.1
* This release includes improvements and fixes to Apple Music. 
* For information on the security content of this update, please visit this website: 
* http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222
* I checked out the security link above, and there are no security updates for iOS 8.4.1. That could be because Apple has yet to post it, or it could be because there are no security updates related to iOS 8.4.1 and the jailbreak lives on.
* The fact is, there’s no way to know for sure if the exploits have been fixed without it being tested. As such, it’s highly recommended that you stay away from iOS 8.4.1 until we can confirm 100% that it’s safe.
* With all of thats said, iOS 8.4.1 contains lots of fixes and some enhancements for Apple Music, which is nice. If you’re not jailbroken, or aren’t interested in doing so, then it would be wise to update for the best and most up to date Apple Music experience.
* Non-jailbroken users can update using OTA in Settings → General → Software Update, or by connecting to iTunes and clicking Update under the device summary.
* Have you updated yet, or are you holding off?
* Update: The rumors were true. iOS 8.4.1 patches the exploits used by the TaiG jailbreak. The TaiG jailbreak that we enjoyed in iOS 8.4 is now dead.
