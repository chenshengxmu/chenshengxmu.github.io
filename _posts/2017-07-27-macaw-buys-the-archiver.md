* MacPaw today announced that it has acquired the popular family of file-extraction apps for macOS, The Unarchiver, saying it’ll keep them updated and available to users free of charge.
* The terms of the deal are not disclosed.
* The Unarchiver was labelled as the essential file-extraction utility for Mac users. With the top ranks on Mac App Store, it boasts millions of users all over the world.
* The archive-extraction app was designed to handle many more formats than the native macOS Archive Utility. It can handle file names in foreign character sets, created with non-English versions of other operating systems.
* MacPaw CEO, Oleksandr Kosovan, said:
* We’re happy to welcome one of the most popular Mac utilities to the family of MacPaw products. It’s a big honor for us to keep the product alive for the users.
* According to Dag Ågren, the developer behind The Unarchiver, he originally created these apps to fill a gap he felt existed after upgrading to a Mac.
* He said:
* I never expected them to be that popular. Who would ever be very excited about an unarchiver? But I massively underestimated the need other people had for programs like these too. Seeing people use them in such numbers has been a very happy experience for me.
* As he had less and less time to actually work on maintaining and updating the apps properly, he’s made the decision to sell The Unarchiver to a party that can take care of them properly and “make sure they stay around for a long time still.”

* “I am sure MacPaw can do a good job of it,” he said.
* MacPaw is the brains behind the “Netflix for Mac apps” subscription service, called Setapp.
* They also develop and market popular Mac utilities such as the Mac cleaning software CleanMyMac, duplicate file finder Gemini and file encryption utility Hider.
* MacPaw will support the Unarchiver, keep it up-to-date, localize into popular languages and make design improvements. As before, the Unarchiver will be free for all Mac users.
* Grab The Unarchiver for free on Mac App Store.
