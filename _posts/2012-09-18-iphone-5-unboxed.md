* Well, it looks like the photo of the iPhone 5 box we posted earlier today is definitely legit. This, after BGR posts what they claim to be the world’s first iPhone 5 unboxing.
* I always thought that unboxings were only for video, but I guess they can appear in photo form as well. We look forward to bringing you a video unboxing, but in the meantime, these shots are admittedly pretty mouth watering.

* As usual with Apple, everything comes neatly wrapped in a minimalistic package. The black looks very nice, I’m glad I picked it this time instead of white. Which color did you choose, and what do you think about the iPhone 5 packaging?
