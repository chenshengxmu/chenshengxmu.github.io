* While there weren’t too many surprises during today’s iPhone event, we did get a couple of small ones afterwards. Apple quietly introduced a handful of new accessories for its just-revealed iPhone 5c and 5s handsets.
* These accessories include a new 2 meter (or 6.5ft) Lightning to USB Cable, which is twice as long as the previous version, as well as—surprisingly—two new Lightning charging docks for its two new smartphones…

* Here’s the product description for the iPhone 5s dock (via 9to5Mac):
* “Charge and sync your iPhone 5s or iPhone 5 with the iPhone 5s Dock. Your iPhone sits upright in the dock as it syncs or charges, so it’s perfect for a desk or countertop. It features a convenient audio line out port that connects to powered speakers. It supports other iPhone 5 accessories, such as the Lightning to USB Cable (sold separately). You can even conduct speakerphone calls with your iPhone in its dock.”
* And here’s the description for the 5c version:
* “Charge and sync your iPhone 5c with the iPhone 5c Dock. Your iPhone sits upright in the dock as it syncs or charges, so it’s perfect for a desk or countertop. It features a convenient audio line out port that connects to powered speakers. You can even conduct speakerphone calls with your iPhone in its dock.”
* It’s interesting because Apple seemingly got out of the dock business last year with the iPhone 5, with SVP Phil Schiller saying “most people who use docks use them with speaker or dock systems.” I guess they changed their minds.
* For those interested, the new Lightning cable will be available for shipping within the next 24 hours and in-stores on September 11 for $29. The new docks, however, won’t be available anywhere until September 20, and will also cost for $29.
