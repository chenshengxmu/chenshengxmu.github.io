* A second generation Apple Watch is rumored to embed not only cellular connection for network connectivity without its paired iPhone, but also a dedicated GPS for accurate workout logging without the need to carry the handset. That’s assuming you believe a sketchy report published this morning by 9to5Mac and credited to an anonymous source with unproven track record.
* The same source also said that the Workout app on the Apple Watch 2 would gain the ability to track swimming.
* Assuming this is true, the ability to track swimming might suggest a much higher level of waterproofing in the next Apple Watch.
* “This was an anonymous source with absolutely no track record, so could be complete BS, but their IP address is at least located near Apple HQ and it came with some seemingly reliable info, so we’re going to put it out there,” cautions the report.
* The current Apple Watch is splash and water resistant, but not fully waterproof.
* 9to5Mac also corroborated an updated story this morning from the reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara saying the iPhone 7 would in fact come in a Space Black colorway resembling the Space Black Apple Watch, not in Deep Blue as originally claimed.
* As for the iPhone 7’s rumored digital Home button which supposedly sits flush with the front plate, 9to5Mac has learned that the non-moving button “will feature haptic feedback to simulate a click, using the same approach as Force Touch.”
