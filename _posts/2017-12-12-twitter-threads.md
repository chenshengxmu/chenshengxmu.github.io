* Twitter on Tuesday announced a new Threads feature in its mobile app for iPhone and iPad, making it a lot easier to post so-called tweetstorms to the micro-blogging service.
* Threads is a feature designed as “a nod to the creativity of the community.”
* A few years ago we noticed people creatively stitching tweets together to share more information or tell a longer story – like this. We saw this approach (which we call “threading”) as an innovative way to present a train of thought, made up of connected but individual elements.
* Tweetstorm, in a nutshell, is a hack of sorts that the Twitter community has come up with in order to be able to serialize a longer story or thought on the service, provide ongoing commentary on an event or topic and more.
* The problem is, this tweeting method, though effective, is quite tricky to create. Making matters worse, reading or discovering all the tweets in a tweetstorm can be challenging.

* To get started with Threads, start a new tweet in the official Twitter mobile app.
* If your thoughts cannot fit in 280 characters, simply tap a new plus button at the bottom of the interface without posting the first tweet. Doing so will add a new tweet to the thread.
* You can add as many tweets to a thread as you’d like and publish them all in one go with a tap of the Tweet All button so that they appear one after the other in people’s timelines.
* Spotting a thread has been simplified, too, with a new “Show this thread” label.
* This update to threads will be rolling out over the next few weeks, so you can easily connect and Tweet multiple thoughts all at once.

* Threads is a staggered rollout so not everyone will get this feature at the same time—Twitter is rolling Threads out to everyone on iOS, Android and Twitter.com in the coming weeks.
* Download Twitter at no charge from App Store.
