* Mailbox users will be happy to hear that the iOS email client received an update today. The release, which brings the app to version 2.0, brings about ‘lots of bug fixes and improvements’ as well as 2 new features: Dropbox syncing for preferences and Auto-swipe.
* While Dropbox syncing for preferences is fairly self-explanatory, Auto-swipe takes some explaining. The feature was first announced by the Mailbox team earlier this month, and its purpose is to learn your in-app behavior in an effort to automate processes…
* Here is your 2.o change log:
* Meet Mailbox 2.0
* – With Auto-swipe, Mailbox learns from your swipes and snoozes to automate common actions. – Mailbox now uses Dropbox to store and sync preferences across your devices. – Lots of bug fixes and improvements
* And a quick overview of Auto-swipe:
* We set out to tame the inbox, and swipes and snoozes were a great first step. But the amount of email we receive daily is only increasing. We don’t just need better tools for dealing with the mail we get, we need more control over what demands our attention in the first place.
* Today, we’re proud to announce a new service built directly into Mailbox that learns from your swipes and snoozes to automate common actions. Mute that thread you don’t care about, snooze messages from your friends until after work, and route receipts to a list — automatically. We call this service Auto-swipe. 
* In addition to Auto-swipe, Mailbox also unveiled a new Android version earlier this month and announced that it was working on a Mac client. While the Android app has been available for some time, the Mac release is—at the time of this writing—still in beta.
* We recently did a post on the top email apps for iPhone, and Mailbox of course made the list. If you haven’t tried it yet, it’s worth checking out. You can find the latest version of Mailbox in the App Store, for both the iPhone and iPad (and soon Mac) for free.
