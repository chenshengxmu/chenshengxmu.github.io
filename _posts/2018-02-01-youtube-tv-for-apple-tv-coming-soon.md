* Google will soon release a dedicated YouTube TV app for the fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV, coming about a year following the app’s debut on iOS, Android and the web.
* According to CNET, YouTube TV for Apple TV is coming “very soon” just as the company this morning expanded the app to Roku devices ahead of Super Bowl LII.
* This is great news for cord-cutters who will be able to take advantage of yet another alternative to traditional cable TV on their big screen TV through their Apple set-top box.
* If you own an Apple TV and have a YouTube TV subscription (starting at $35 per month), the app will let you stream cable television shows from the likes of ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, CW, Disney, ESPN, FX, USA and dozens of other major channels.
