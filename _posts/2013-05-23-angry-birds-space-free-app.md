* It’s pretty mind-boggling to think about what the folks at Rovio have done with the Angry Birds franchise. What started out as just a simple game has turned into a multimedia empire complete with its own clothing line, TV show, and feature film.
* And for those of you who’ve yet to see what all of the fuss is about, I have some good news for you. Apple has just named Angry Birds Space as its ‘App of the Week’, meaning you can download the game (iPhone and iPad) for free for a limited time…
* Angry Birds Space features the same addictive gameplay found in Rovio’s other Angry Birds titles, with the exception of its space-themed levels and a ‘zero gravity’ gameplay mechanic that allows you to get more creative with your bird-flinging skills.
* “Angry Birds Space features over 160 interstellar levels on planets and in zero gravity, resulting in spectacular gameplay ranging from slow-motion puzzles to lightspeed destruction. With regular free updates, new in-app purchases, brand new birds, brand new superpowers, and a whole galaxy to explore, the sky is no longer the limit!”
* Because Rovio’s Angry Bird titles have been so successful, they rarely get discounted like this. So you’ll want to take advantage of the deal while you can. Angry Birds Space, and Angry Birds Space HD for iPad will be free in the App Store for the next 7 days.
