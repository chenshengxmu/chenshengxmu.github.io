* FiLMiC Pro, the best video recording software on iOS used by filmmakers and pros, was updated on App Store with the ability to shoot in High Efficiency Video Coding (also known as H.265), a video compression standard supported in iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra.
* Aside from bringing official support for iOS 11, the new FiLMiC Pro version 6.3 includes the HEVC recording option in the resolution settings panel. The storage-friendly format doubles the compression ratio of H.264, meaning users get similar video quality at around half the file size or higher quality, resolution and frame rates at the same file size.
* TUTORIAL: How to choose between HEIF/H.265 & JPG/H.264 media formats in iOS 11
* Note that capturing H.265-encoded video requires an iOS device with Apple’s A10 Fusion chip or later, like 2017 iPad Pros, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.
* FiLMiC Pro automatically uses HEVC for any frame rate greater than 30fps for 1080p or higher resolution. The refreshed app also comes with a new Time Code Track option found in the CMS settings panel.
* When enabled, it prompts the app to embed a time code track in your video based on the real time of day that the clip is shot. This simplifies post-production processes by allowing multiple videos shot simultaneously to be edited together quickly based on a common time code track.
* This update is free to existing users of the app.
* FiLMiC Pro for iPhone and iPad is $14.99 in App Store.
