* Apple’s HomePod was by far one of the most exciting announcements at WWDC 2017. A totally new kind of technology for Apple’s realm of expertise, HomePod is a speaker system that also acts as a Siri virtual assistant and HomeKit controller, among other things.
* In this piece, we’ll go over the HomePod’s tech specs so that you have an idea of what kind of technology is packed into the new accessory.
*  
* These are the official tech specs for the HomePod.
* It’s worth noting that the device is not Bluetooth enabled, and connects to your devices and HomeKit accessories via Wi-Fi only. Additionally, there’s no battery, so it must be plugged into a power source at all times to remain functional, which might be a downer for some.
* HomePod isn’t available for purchase yet as of this writing, but it will be available in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States for $349 starting in December 2017. HomePod will join the rest of the world in the beginning of 2018.
