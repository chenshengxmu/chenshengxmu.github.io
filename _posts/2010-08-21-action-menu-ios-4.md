* It’s like Christmas for me right now. One of my favorite jailbreak apps, Action Menu, has been updated to bring support for iOS 4, the iPhone 4 and the iPad. I’ve always confessed my love for Action Menu, which saves me tons of time in my everyday usage of the iPhone.
* For those of you who don’t know about Action Menu, let me give you a quick glimpse at what it does. Action Menu takes a stab at enhancing the copy/paste function of your iPhone by adding a bunch of add-ons to it. The lite version is free but for $2.99, you can get the full-featured app, which I think is well worth the money.
* Included in Action Menu (free):
* Included in Plus Pack ($2.99):
* Of course you don’t have to use all of these. I actually only use a few, namely: copy all, favorites, scroll, history, and find. You can set what you want or not in the settings.
* I really wish Ryan Petrich, the developer of Action Menu, had added the ability to label the “favorites”. Right now it can get messy in your favorites and if like me you have tons of them, it gets hard to figure out what is what in there. It’s a detail that I hope will be fixed in a future update.
* The free version is a no brainer. Please make sure to give it a try. Then if you feel you need more out of Action Menu, upgrade to the full version. Seriously, it will be the best 3 bucks you’ve ever spent on a jailbreak app.
