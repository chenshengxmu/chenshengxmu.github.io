* For those of us that weren’t lucky enough to be at Apple’s press event today, the Cupertino firm has just made the whole ‘Let’s Talk iPhone’ event available online.
* The video, all 90 minutes of it, can be streamed right now from Apple’s web site, and we expect it to hit Apple’s iTunes Podcast feed later today…
* We can’t wait to see the event for ourselves, and witness the unveiling of Apple’s latest and greatest smartphone, the iPhone 4S. In particular, Scott Forstall’s (lengthy) Siri announcement is said to be one of the highlights of the show, alongside the iPhone 4S announcement itself.
* The video also shows off Apple’s newly updated iPod range, with the iPod Nano receiving a selection of fancy new watch faces, perfect for those who like to wear the diminutive little jukebox as a timepiece.
* We’re all off to watch the video ourselves using, and thanks to the magic that is AirPlay, at least one iDB member will be sat back with a drink and a big screen TV – it’s been a long day already at iDB Towers!
* Let us know what you think to Apple’s announcements after you’ve given the video a watch – you know where the comments are!
