* Over the past week or so, there have been rumors floating around about a 3G-Enabled iPod Touch coming later this fall. If this were happen, you would be able to use 3G data on your iPod Touch, for Facetime, iMessages, etc. You would also be able to use a VoIP app, such as Skype or Viber, to call people from your iPod Touch.
* We took this concept to Photoshop, and we came up with the iPod Touch 3G. It looks exactly like the current iPod Touch, but has a black strip on the back. It also says “3G” in the menu bar. Along with that, it also features an integrated SIM card, as the next iPhone is rumored to have…
* This idea could be possible in the future, as an iPhone “Nano” is rumored to be coming out in the fall, which could essentially be an iPod Touch with a 3G radio inside.
* What are your thoughts on this? Do you think there will be a 3G iPod Touch in the fall? Leave it in the comments below.
