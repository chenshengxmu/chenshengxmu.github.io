* The cat and mouse game between Apple and the jailbreak community is still very much happening, if an unconfirmed message from an apparent member of the Pangu Team is to be believed.
* Weibo user Daniel_K4, who is apparently a member of the Pangu Team recently posted that iOS 8.1.1 beta that was released yesterday patches exploits used by the Pangu jailbreak, incapacitating the jailbreak process on devices that will be updated to the latest OS version once it is released to the public.
* The Weibo message translation, courtesy of Reddit user illusiomist:
* Apple has released iOS 8.1.1 beta to developers. After our tests, it has patched the jailbreak exploit. Anyone who wish to jailbreak, please seize the chance to upgrade to iOS 8.1 and do so before Apple officially releases iOS 8.1.1.
* So what does it mean for jailbreakers?
* It means that devices running iOS 8.1.1 won’t be able to run the jailbreak in its current state. We can always hope the Pangu Team has other tricks up its sleeves and may come with other ways to jailbreak iOS 8.1.1, but the message posted on Weibo by Daniel_K4 doesn’t seem to let any of that hope shine between the words.
* If you’re already running iOS 8.1, and you’re already jailbroken, then it seems that your best bet is to enjoy what you have now and make sure you do not update to iOS 8.1.1 once it is released.
* If you aren’t running iOS 8.1 yet, then this might be your last chance to update now and jailbreak using the latest version of Pangu.
* The Pangu Team itself hasn’t come forward and acknowledged yet that iOS 8.1.1 kills the Pangu jailbreak, so until we get a full confirmation from the team itself, we can only hope that this information isn’t completely accurate. No matter what, we still recommend you proceed with caution. We will of course keep you updated of any new development.
