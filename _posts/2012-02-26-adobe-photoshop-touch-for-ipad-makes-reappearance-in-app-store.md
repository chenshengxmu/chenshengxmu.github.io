* Saturday night, Adobe launched its new Photoshop Touch for iPad app into the App Store in Australia , New Zealand and more, but quickly pulled the app shortly after. We assume someone pulled the trigger a little early.
* Tonight, Photoshop Touch for iPad has made a reappearance in the App Store, priced at the same $9.99. As a refresher, Photoshop Touch looks like the perfect photo editor on the iPad…
* You can read our post last night for the full list of features.
* You can purchase Adobe Photoshop Touch for iPad for $9.99 on the iTunes App Store. Remember, this is iPad 2 exclusive.
* What do you think of Adobe’s new photo editor?
