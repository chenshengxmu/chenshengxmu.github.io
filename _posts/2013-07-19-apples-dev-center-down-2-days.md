* If you’ve tried logging in to Apple’s dev center over the past few days, but were unsuccessful, you weren’t alone. The portal, which is where the company stores downloads, documentation and other resources for developers, has been down for 48 hours.
* This isn’t your typical ‘maintenance’ downtime, as those only usually last a couple of minutes—or at worst, a few hours. And as you can imagine, developers are starting to get frustrated with the service, which Apple charges a $99 subscription fee for…
* Apple had remained mum on the outage until this evening, when it posted this note:

* “We’ll be back soon. We apologize that maintenance is taking longer than expected. If your program membership was set to expire during this period, it has been extended and your app will remain on the App Store. If you have any other concerns about your account, please contact us. Thank you for your patience.”
* For developers, this couldn’t have happened at a more inconvenient time. Apple released beta versions of its next-generation desktop and mobile operating systems last month, ahead of their fall launches, and developers have been working non-stop to bring their apps up to speed.
