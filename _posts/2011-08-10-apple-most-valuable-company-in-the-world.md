* Yesterday we told you that, for the first time, Apple had briefly become the most valuable company in the world, dethroning Exxon for a few minutes, and ending the day at the #2 spot.
* Today, for the first time ever, Apple ended the trading day ahead of Exxon, and Apple is now the company with the largest market capitalization…
* Apple ended the day with a market cap of 337.17 billion dollars, while Exxon ended at 330.77 billion dollars.
* So what’s the next step for Apple? A trillion dollars, I’m telling you.
