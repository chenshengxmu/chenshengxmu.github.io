* T-Mobile said today that its JUMP! upgrade program and Premium Device Protection now include free AppleCare+ for iPhone and iPad because “the best devices in the world deserve the best protection and care.”
* Both T-Mobile’s Premium Device Protection (formerly known as Premium Handset Protection) and the JUMP! upgrade program now come with AppleCare services for eligible customers who recently purchased a new device.
* Priced at $12 per month, JUMP! now includes protection from loss, theft or accidental damage, hardware coverage, the security features of Lookout Mobile Security Premium and AppleCare+. “If you add JUMP! or Premium Device Protection and have a new eligible iPhone or iPad, you will be able to access AppleCare services,” says the firm.
* The carrier says that customers who get its new Premium Device Protection will be able to keep it when they JUMP! to the latest iPhone or iPad. T-Mobile, of course, already has the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and the new 9.7-inch iPad in its offering.

* With AppleCare+, you get perks like extended warranty up to two years from the original purchase date which covers up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to a service fee of $29 for screen damage or $99 for any other damage.
* Other AppleCare+ perks include:
* AppleCare+ for most iPhone models is priced at $129 or $99 for iPhone SE.
* As of recently, AppleCare+ plans can be purchased up to twelve months after buying your device. Previously, Apple required that AppleCare for iPhone be purchased up to 60 days following an iPhone purchase.
* Apple’s own iPhone Upgrade Program, starting at $32.41 per month, includes AppleCare+ at no additional charge and spreads out the full cost of your handset into monthly payments over two years with zero percent interest. iPhone Upgrade Program also lets you upgrade to a new iPhone after twelve payments.
