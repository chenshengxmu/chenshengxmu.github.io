* With iOS 7, Apple is for the first time allowing for ‘Made for iPhone’ (MFi) physical game controllers in a bid to solidify its mobile gaming lead. We’ve already seen Logitech’s upcoming iOS 7 gaming controller (ClamCase is also working on one) and now a photo has surfaced depicting Moga’s upcoming MFi controller which will come with a massive built-in 1800mAh battery, have a look at it below the fold…
* The credible EVLeaks tweeted out the above shot this morning.
* Apple mentioned at June’s Worldwide Developers Conference that Moga was one of the companies working on a MFi iPhone controller. EVLeaks claims the accessory will be branded as AcePower and feature a built-in 1800mAh battery.
* And this is what it looks like closed, without an iPhone docked.

* iOS 7 supports two types of physical controllers: the form-fitting ones that dock the device itself right intro the controller and standalone variants which pair with any iOS 7 device over Bluetooth.
* The iPhone maker is understood to be closely working with accessory makers like Logitech on these controllers and being an avid gamer, I can’t wait to put my hands on one of these beauties.
* Existing games won’t automagically gain MFi controller support, but I have no doubt in my mind that game devs are integrating MFi controller support into their games as we speak.
* The physical MFi controllers should be Godsent for action titles, retro games and so forth. Having thought this through really thoroughly, Apple is also allowing for an extended MFi controller configuration which adds thumbsticks and an extra set of shoulder buttons.
* Moga’s upcoming thingie is an extended MFi variant: if the leaked shots are anything to go by, the gizmo will sport thumbsticks on the left and right, the traditional D-pad on the left and a set of buttons on the right front and shoulders of the device.

* And now that Apple has introduced a new framework in iOS 7 allowing developers to read input from the buttons, the iOS platform will give handheld gaming consoles from the likes of  Sony and Nintendo a hell of a run for their money.
* And who knows, this could be a prelude to full-blown 1080p Apple TV games on your big screen TV.
* The future is bright…
