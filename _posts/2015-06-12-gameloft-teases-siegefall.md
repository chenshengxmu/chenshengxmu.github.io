* Ahead of next week’s annual Electronic Entertainment Expo bonanza in Los Angeles, French games maker Gameloft is teasing Siegefall, its forthcoming mobile game from the same team that brought you the first four installments of Modern Combat, the popular first-person shooter franchise. In Siegefall, you arrive in a realm where battles are being fought over lands and crowns.
* While full details are yet to be released, we know that Siegefall will let you summon dragons, control heroes, smash gates and “leave nothing but rubble behind.”
* In Siegefall, you’re tasked with building an unbeatable army of controllable heroes to begin your reign. The online multiplayer strategy game sports a bunch of enemy challenges and features certain aspects of card-trading games so expect a bunch of magic cards to boost your stats and more.

* “Players will challenge others worldwide in fast, tactical combat,” reads the blurb. “Take direct control of your forces to break through castle defenses using raw might and your mastery of magic.”

* Matt Cobuzio came up to Gameloft Studios in Montreal and got an early look at Siegefall, check out his video below for some incredible-looking gameplay footage.
* Gameloft will be demoing Siegefall at E3 next week.
* Besiege your enemies
* Expand your kingdom
* It’s all about personality
* The game will be coming to the AppStore, Google Play and Windows platforms “very soon” and we’ll have a detailed preview once more information is released.
* I’m not a big fan of multiplayer strategy games, but Siegefall sure looks wonderful and I think I’ll be taking it for a spin when it’s released.
* You?
