* Realizing rival accessory maker Stratus has shaved $20 off its ‘Made for iPhone’ (MFi) wireless iOS 7 controller dubbed SteelSeries, Logitech has decided to play along and bring its overpriced PowerShell down to $70. The Logitech accessory now undercuts Stratus by a cool $10 as the PowerShell is now $30 cheaper versus its original price of $99.
* It’s a limited time offer so hurry up because the sale ends February 1, 2014 (they should have made it permanent). So is this controller now a good value? Read on…
* If you were going to buy a PowerShell or a SteelSeries, keep in mind that Logitech’s is a form-fitting controller – as in, you actually plugs into your device’s Lightning port so the two become much like the PlayStation Vita. This is perfect if you want to play games on the go on your iPhone or iPod touch using physical buttons.
* There’s a 1500 mAh battery inside that’ll charge your iOS device when docked.
* The SteelSeries, on the other hand, is a regular-looking controller that connects to an iOS device wirelessly, via Bluetooth, making it more suitable for playing games from the comfort of your couch, especially if you’re going to be streaming games to an Apple TV via AirPlay.
* The PowerShell includes regular action buttons, shoulder bumpers and a directional pad and comes with an adapter allowing you to connect headphones to the accessory.
* If Razer thought about selling its upcoming Kazuyo MFi controller for $99, I guess they’re going to rethink their pricing strategy. Clearly, folks are not eager to shell a hundred bucks for an iPhone controller when Sony’s DualShock 4 retails for $60 and Microsoft’s Xbox One controller for as low as $60.
* Jailbroken folks can simply install the $1.99 Controllers for All tweak and pair a DualShock (or any other Bluetooth-enabled controller) with your iOS device.
* How’s that for value for money?
