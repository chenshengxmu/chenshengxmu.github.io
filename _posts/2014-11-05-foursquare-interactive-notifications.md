* Taking advantage of iOS 8’s new Interactive Notifications, Foursquare, the popular local search and discovery service, on Wednesday refreshed its main iPhone client with the ability to ‘save,’ ‘like,’ and ‘follow’ from the notifications you get from the service.
* As before, the new Foursquare 8.2 has native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus resolutions and now comes with 1Password integration.
* 1Password integration allows fans of the popular password-management app to use their saved credentials when logging in to Foursquare, without having to paste the password manually.
* A month ago, Foursquare’s check-in app called Swarm received a similar update permitting users to check in to locations from the Lock screen or within iOS 8’s Notification Center via a new Today widget.
* Download Foursquare free in the App Store.
* Foursquare 8.2 changelog
* After unveiling its new brand identity this summer, Foursquare has revamped its mobile app around Yelp-like features with a strong focus on location discovery.
* Under the new strategy, Foursquare’s most popular social features and check-ins have been moved to a brand new iPhone app, Swarm, as the team reimagined the main client around location discovery.
* Foursquare is available free in the App Store.
* The 19.6-megabyte app runs on the iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
