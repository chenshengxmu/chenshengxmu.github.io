* Instagram officially announced support for logging into more than one Instagram account at a time in its free iOS and Android apps on Monday, and many of you that use Instagram on a daily basis are probably wondering how you can get your hands dirty with the feature.
* Although signing in with multiple Instagram accounts is a feature that is still currently rolling out to all users, it’s possible to force your app to allow you to sign in with multiple accounts right now.
* Once you get your Instagram app updated to the latest version and are ready to get started with using multiple user accounts in the app, you can follow this tutorial on how to manage all your Instagram accounts from the app.
* This new feature is definitely targeting a niche audience of users, but for people who have multiple Instagram accounts, such as business owners that use Instagram for personal use, as well as to promote their business, or for users that have multiple accounts based on their various interests, having the ability to easily switch between accounts seems like a feature we should have had since the beginning of Instagram.
* After all, if you’re a business owner and you wanted to be able to switch between your business account and personal account on a regular basis, you always had to sign out of one and then sign back into another, which meant constantly typing in usernames and passwords. That could get cumbersome after doing it just a couple of times.
* Before you can start switching between your existing Instagram accounts, you first have to add another Instagram account to your app in addition to the one you’re already using.
* To do that, you’ll follow these steps:
* Step 1: Launch the Instagram app on your iPhone and tap on your account tab at the bottom right of the app.
* Step 2: Tap on the Settings button at the top right of the app and scroll all the way down to the bottom of the settings.
* Step 3: Tap on the “Add Account” button just under the “Clear Search History” button, and then sign in with another Instagram account (or sign up by creating a new one if necessary).

* After signing in with your additional Instagram account, you’ve completed half of this tutorial. Now, you just have to learn how to switch back and forth between your Instagram accounts while you’re logged in.
* If you’re logged in to an Instagram account already, and are also signed in with another Instagram account simultaneously, then switching to the other account to see what’s new is fast and easy. There are actually two days to do this, and we’ll outline both ways for you below.
* For the first way, you need to follow these steps:
* Step 1: After launching the Instagram app, tap on your account tab at the bottom right of the app to reveal your account page.
* Step 2: Tap on your Instagram username at the top and a drop down menu showing all your active Instagram accounts will appear.

* Step 3: Tap on the account you want to use, and you should see a green banner appear that says “Switched to [insert username here]” indicating that you’re successfully switched to a different Instagram account in the app.
* Note: From this drop down menu, you can also easily add another Instagram account by tapping on the “Add Account” button.
* Another way to switch between your Instagram accounts easily is to follow these steps:
* Step 1: From anywhere in the Instagram app, tap and hold on your account tap at the bottom right of the app.
* Step 2: When the pop-up appears, tap on the account you would prefer to use from the selection list.

* Step 3: After choosing a different account you’re logged in with, you’ll see a green banner to confirm you’ve switched to a different Instagram account.
* Managing multiple Instagram accounts on your iPhone all at the same time no longer requires you to sign out of an account completely to sign into a different one. The recent app update makes life a lot easier on those with multiple Instagram accounts, and we encourage those who use multiple accounts to take advantage of it.
* If you’re not already using Instagram on your iPhone, you can download it for free from the App Store.
