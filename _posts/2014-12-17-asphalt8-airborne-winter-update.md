* Gameloft on Wednesday pushed a holiday-themed update to its freemium racing game for the iPhone and iPad, the insanely crazy, action-driven Asphalt 8: Airborne.
* The Winter update brings eleven new cars, including the Tramontana XTR and Arrinera Hussarya, a brand new challenging location to put your driving skills to the ultimate test, pro kits and a brand new token system.
* As Asphalt 8 is a free-to-play game with In-App Purchases to upgrade your vehicles, designers have created the new token system to help players earn new cars, get boosters and refill fuel.
* You can earn tokens by playing events or you can — need I say more? — buy them for real cash in the in-game shop.
* The video gives a sneak peek of what to expect in this update and if you watch it you’ll notice some new winter-themed tracks that look quite nice and challenging.
* Asphalt 8: Airborne 1.7.2 changelog:
* The massive 1.15-gigabyte download supports any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 5.1 or later.
* Download Asphalt 8: Airborne for free in the App Store.
