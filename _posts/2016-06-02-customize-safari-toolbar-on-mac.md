* Last week, we showed you how you could customize the toolbar on your Mac’s Finder window to better suit your needs, but there are other apps throughout the OS X operating system that come with toolbar-editing capabilities as well.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can customize the toolbar in the Safari web browser to make your web surfing experience the best it can be for your specific needs.
* Everyone’s web surfing habits are different, and when it comes right down to it, you really need to tailor your web browser’s user interface to get the most out of it and so it will work around your own needs, rather than somebody else’s.
* For this reason, Apple has built in a toolbar-editing interface into Safari for Mac. To access it, follow these steps:
* 1) Right click anywhere in the blank space in the Safari toolbar:

* 3) You will now see a cluster of various buttons and functions you are able to drag in or out of the toolbar in your Safari window. Drag features in and out as you please.

* 4) After you are done, be sure to click on the blue Done button to save any changes you make.
* Among the various things you can add or remove from the Safari toolbar are:
* The list of features you can have in Safari that aren’t present out of the box is quite extensive, so if you’re a Safari power-user, then you might find some of these hidden features useful, and adding them to your Safari window user interface could be beneficial to your specific type of workflow.
* Keep in mind that a template for the original Safari user interface is always kept at the bottom of the editing interface. This way, you can always return to the factory settings, so you never have to worry about messing things up.
* Because everyone uses the internet differently, having the ability to customize the Safari user interface is an invaluable ability every Mac user should become familiar with.
