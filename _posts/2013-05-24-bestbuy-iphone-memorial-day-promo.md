* U.S. retailer Best Buy is set to shave $50 off every iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 sold with a two-year contract with Verizon, AT&T or Sprint in a four-week promotion that kicks off on Sunday, reports AllThingsD. The retailer has previously discounted Apple’s iPhone 5 a few times in time-limited promotions, along with other retailers such as Walmart which last December discounted the device to as low as $127…
* The promotion is a nice opportunity to grab a 16GB iPhone 5 for just $150 with a two-year contract.
* Ina Fried, reporting for AllThingsD, explains that Best Buy in additional short-term promotions over Memorial Day is including “several popular but older Android models.”
* Specifically, from May 26 to June 1 Samsung’s Galaxy S III will retail for $49 on AT&T or Sprint (a $50 saving), HTC’s Droid DNA for Verizon for $49 (a $150 saving) and HTC’s One X on AT&T for free (a $100 saving).
* It’s not clear whether Best Buy is clearing stock ahead of a next-generation iPhone or just including Apple’s handset in the Memorial Day Android promotion.
* For what it’s worth, given the aforementioned Android devices are discounted only from May 26 to June 1 while Apple’s handset is offered for $50 less in a four-week run gives us reasons to suspect that Best Buy could in fact be clearing old stock. Apple’s distributors normally slash current iPhone models in the weeks leading up to a new model.
* The iPhone maker said it will preview iOS 7 and OS X 10.9 at its summer developers conference, which takes place at Moscone West in San Francisco from Monday, June 10 until Friday, June 14.
* A company spokesperson confirmed the company will be holding a keynote on Monday, June 10. We’re not expecting any hardware announcements at WWDC, but this is Apple so we won’t know for sure until Tim Cook & Co. take the stage.
