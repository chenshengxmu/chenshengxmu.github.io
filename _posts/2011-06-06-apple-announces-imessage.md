* If you haven’t been excited much about the few features iOS 5 has already unveiled, here is one that should get you pumped. iMessage.
* iMessages is a service that works for all iOS 5 users. It supports iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, and it allows you to send text, photos, videos, contacts to any of your friends, assuming they have an iOS device…
* With iMessage, we’ve created a new messaging service for all iOS 5 users. You can send unlimited text messages via Wi-Fi or 3G from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch to anyone with one of those devices. iMessage is built into the Messages app, so you can send text, photos, videos, locations, and contacts. Keep everyone in the loop with group messaging. Track your messages with delivery receipts and optional read receipts, see when someone’s typing, and enjoy secure encryption for text messages. Even start a conversation on one of your iOS devices and pick up where you left off on another.
* iMessage will work on both wifi and 3G and is encrypted for extra security.

* In short, iMessage is the iOS version of BlackBerry Messenger. I can’t wait to get my hands on this new app.
