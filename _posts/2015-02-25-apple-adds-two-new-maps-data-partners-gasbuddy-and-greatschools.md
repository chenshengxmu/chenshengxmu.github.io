* Apple’s acknowledgements page for its Maps service has been recently updated with several new references, MacRumors reports. Among the companies cited are GasBuddy and GreatSchools, both of which are data aggregates that display information about nearby gasoline stations and schools, respectively.
* We spoke to a GasBuddy representative and were told that the company will not be providing Apple Maps with gas prices and similar data, but instead will share station information, specifically the station’s brand name and address. Apple will likely use this data to quickly update any changes in a gas station’s ownership or brand, for example, meaning the GasBuddy iPhone app will still be useful for finding the cheapest nearby gas price.
* It is currently unclear what data GreatSchools will be sharing with Apple, but a likely answer is that the information will also be limited to school names and locations and not as detailed as the available programs and academic test scores that the service provides for its users.
* Apple is actively working to improve its Maps service after its highly-critized launch in 2012 alongside iOS 6. These enhancements include a possible upcoming web version of Maps and Maps Connect, a tool for businesses to add and edit their Apple Maps listing. The information collected from GasBuddy and GreatSchools appears to also be part of Apple’s plan to improve its Maps service and keep its data updated and relevant.
