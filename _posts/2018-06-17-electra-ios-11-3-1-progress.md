* It wasn’t long ago that security researcher Ian Beer released a handful of convenient exploits for some of the latest iterations of iOS 11, and now CoolStar’s Electra jailbreak tool is well on its way to supporting these particular firmware versions as a result.
* While the official Electra web page hasn’t been updated with a new version of the tool just yet, the Electra Team continues to update the jailbreak community with progress milestone announcements as they transpire.
* The team first noted that it achieved a fully-operational jailbreak on iOS 11.2-11.2.6 on June 11th, but the next major announcement concerning a fully-operational jailbreak on iOS 11.3.1 didn’t come until Sunday afternoon:

* The week-long delay between the two was allegedly related to an issue with the rootfs remount. Fortunately, it now appears that the Electra Team found a way around it.
* As of this writing, there’s no tangible ETA for when Electra will support jailbreaking iOS 11.2-11.3.1, but the seemingly-unstoppable momentum that we’re witnessing indicates that we can expect it to drop very soon.
* In the meantime, the Electra Team is undoubtedly deploying their jailbreak tool on devices with various firmware combinations to test its stability before making it publicly available.
* As always, we advise jailbreak community folks not to harass members of the Electra Team with ETA questions or early-access requests; the tool will be ready when it’s ready.
* Are you excited about the hype surrounding the iOS 11.3.1 jailbreak? Let us know in the comments below!
