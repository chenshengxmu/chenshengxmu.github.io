* A brand new Apple Watch Pride face has been discovered in watchOS 4.3.1 software, inspired by the rainbow flag. Featuring threads of color, the Pride face animates very nicely and smoothly in a different way every time the user touches the screen.
* Even though the upcoming Apple Watch Pride face is scheduled to become available next Monday, June 4 at 12pm Pacific Time, you can activate it right now with a simple workaround.
* 9to5Mac’s Guilherme Rambo has managed to unearth strings proving the existence of a new rainbow-colored watch face in the latest watchOS 4.3.1 and iOS 11.4 software updates.
* iOS 11.4’s Watch app includes a placeholder image for the Pride face.

* Additionally, watchOS 4.3.1 includes video assets used to render and animate the new face.
* While you’d be hard-pressed to figure it out based on the preview animation displayed above, this face animates in a different way every time you touch the display. The actual clock face will, of course, also display your clock and up to three complications.
* Here’s how you can activate the Pride watch face right now.
* You basically just need to move your date ahead.
* 1) Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
* 2) Tap General.
* 3) Tap Date & Time.
* TIP: If Set Automatically is enabled, turn it off.
* 4) Make sure to set the date at least to June 5.

* 5) Quit Settings and open the Watch app on your iPhone.
* 6) Tap Face Gallery at the bottom.
* 7) The Pride face should pop up in the section New in watchOS. Tap it to select it.
* TIP: Your paired iPhone must be on the commercial edition of the iOS 11.4 software or newer. The Pride face may not show up on iOS 11.4 developer betas and public betas.
* 8) Tap Add to enable the Pride face on your Apple Watch.
* “This face is inspired by the rainbow flag,” reads the description. “The threads of color move if you tap the display,” and they do so differently each time you touch the screen.

* 9) All that’s left to do for you is to press your Apple Watch display firmly with Force Touch to enter the watch face selection interface, swipe horizontally to select the newly activated Pride face, then tap Customize to adjust up to three complications.
* Again, be sure that your paired iPhone is on the iOS 11.4 software or newer and that you’re using watchOS 4.3.1 on your Apple Watch. Otherwise, this workaround solution won’t work.
* Again, the Pride face may not show up on public betas or developer-only gold masters.

* With WWDC just around the corner, we’ll soon find out if Apple will open up Apple Watch faces to third-party developers, which is perhaps the community’s most-requested feature.
* Don’t forget to change back the date on your iPhone!
