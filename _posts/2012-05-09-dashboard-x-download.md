title: Dashboard X now available on Cydia
---
* Dashboard X, the long awaited jailbreak tweak that allows you to add widgets to your Home screen is now available for download on Cydia, via the ModMyi repo for $1.99.
* This tweak allows you to take existing widgets created for Notification Center and position them anywhere on your iPhone or iPad Home screen. On top of that, new widgets are being developed, such as Dashtweet, a Dashboard X widget that allows you to send tweets from anywhere on your Home screen.
* Something tells me we’re going to see many more widgets designed to work with Dashboard X. Whether you like the concept or not, it’s nice to see the jailbreak community being so creative.
* Want more about this topic?
