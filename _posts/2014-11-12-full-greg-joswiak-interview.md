* In October, Apple’s VP of iPhone marketing Greg Joswiak participated in an on-stage interview at Recode’s inaugural Code/Mobile conference. During the 30-minute discussion, Joswiak talked about several topics including the iOS 8.0.1 debacle, Apple Pay and more.
* Since Joswiak isn’t on Apple’s senior executive team, we don’t get to see him talk very often, but he offers up some interesting information in this interview. We already covered some of the major highlights here, but now you can watch the whole thing on the video below.

* Joswiak has played a significant role in Apple’s success over the last several years, and is currently in charge of selling the iPhone. He’s a marketing guru, with a knack for product placement, and rumor has it he plays a major role in product development and helps set prices.
* In addition to Joswiak, both CEO Tim Cook and head of design Jony Ive represented Apple in recent high profile interviews. It’s been a huge month for the company, who has unveiled a number of new products, including a mobile payment service and the upcoming Apple Watch.
