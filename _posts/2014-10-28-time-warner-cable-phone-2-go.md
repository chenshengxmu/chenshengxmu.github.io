* Your Home Phone service from Time Warner Cable is no longer limited by physical location as the nation’s second largest cable company behind Comcast revealed a new iPhone application Tuesday.
* Dubbed Phone 2 Go and available as a free download from the App Store, the software allows existing TWC Home Phone subscribers to use text, voice and video calling for no additional fees.
* In addition, you can decide whether you’d like to use your Home Phone service to receive voice and video calls and text messages on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad anywhere there’s Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, including overseas.
* Indeed, world travelers can use Phone 2 Go and free Wi-Fi hotspots to check on their voicemail, use voice and other Home Phone services without worrying about cellular voice overages and high international calling rates.
* Built-in voicemail management lets you listen to the messages made to your Home Phone and provides access to the visual voicemail features. Phone 2 Go also includes privacy features and supports up to five devices registered on your Home Phone line.
* Home Phone starts at $10 per month to make unlimited calls to the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, with low-cost international calling plans available as well.
