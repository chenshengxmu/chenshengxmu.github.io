* Apple’s upcoming science-fiction space drama series from “Star Trek” veteran and “Battlestar Galactica” and “Outlander” developer Ronald D. Moore has reportedly cast actress Sarah Jones and actors Joel Kinnaman and Michael Dorman.
* Deadline first reported the three castings yesterday.
* Former “The Killing and Altered Carbon” star Joel Kinnaman, “Patriot” star Michael Dorman and “Damnation” co-star Sarah Jones have been reportedly tapped as the leads in Apple’s upcoming space drama series from Ronald D. Moore.
* “Kinnaman will play Edward Baldwin, one of the top NASA astronauts. Dorman and Jones will play Gordo and Tracy Stevens, one of the prominent NASA couples,” said the publication.
* Dorman has played the lead on the Amazon Studios’ quirky genre-bending spy drama series ‘Patriot’, whose second season was ordered 16 months ago but is yet to air. Because of the delay, Dorman was able to book a new series.
* I hear Amazon will likely not make a formal renewal decision on ‘Patriot’ until Season 2 is released, and should they opt to do another season, they will have to work around Dorman’s schedule on the Apple series.
* Created and written by Ronald D. Moore along with Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi, Apple’s yet-to-be-named series explores what would have happened if the global space race had never ended.
* The show is produced by Sony Pictures Television and Moore’s Tall Ship Productions.
