* Strong demand and five million sales (perhaps even more) during the opening weekend continue to put a strain on the initial iPhone 5 supply. If you’re in the market for an iPhone 5 and are an avid Apple fan, there’s a reasonable chance you’ll want to waltz inside one of Cupertino’s shiny retail shrines. After all, a new iPhone is a once-in-a-year event so why not treat yourself to that talked-about buying and ownership experience, right?
* The problem is, the iPhone 5 is hard to come by at the moment, even as Apple is regularly stocking stores. Luckily, there’s now a better way of buying the sought-after device involving a simple online pre-reservation for in-store pickup the following day…
* It’s a huge time saver: no longer do you need to drive to the nearest Apple Store every day to check if the iPhone 5 is available.
* The word on the street is that Apple will begin taking online pre-reservations in the U.S. and UK starting 10pm tonight, for the following day. I’d download and install the official Apple Store app as it greatly simplifies the buying process.
* Note that your mileage may wary because pre-reservations depend on daily iPhone inventory.
* If the system won’t accept your pre-reservation, try again the next day or the day after.
* Another thing to keep in mind: pre-reserved devices must be picked up in-store in the next 24 hours.
* Otherwise, your order will be cancelled and the company will issue a refund.
* Sebastien was able to officially verify the news with an Apple specialist and just snapped the above shot at the Apple Store in Carlsbad, California.
* The sign reads:
* Due to the popularity of iPhone 5, limited quantities are available for walk-in purchase.
* You can also visit apple.com/retail/iphone after 10:00 p.m. to order one for pickup in store.
* For more details, talk to a Specialist.
* For now, Apple’s retail page still says that iPhone 5 purchases are available on a first-come, first-served basis:
* Now available for walk-in purchase on a first-come, first-served basis at your favorite Apple Retail Store. We can help you choose the right rate plan and get you up and running.
* Over at the UK Apple Store, however, the retail page reads:
* Reserve yours now and pick it up in store. Limited quantities are also available for walk-in purchase on a first-come, first-served basis. Either way, we can help you choose the right tariff and get you up and running.
* According to our little poll, the vast majority of respondents pre-ordered their iPhone 5 and had it delivered to their doorstep.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a media release announcing sales of five million iPhone 5 units:
* While we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date. We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone.
* Not sure about you, but I’d rather deal with humans as little as possible so in my view, pre-reserving stuff is always the way to go.
* Plus, it’s both a time saver and convenience.
* Besides, you get a nice excuse to visit an Apple store.
* And you?
