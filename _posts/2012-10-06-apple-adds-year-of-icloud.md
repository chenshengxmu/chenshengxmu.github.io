* When Apple announced iCloud last year, it told MobileMe users that they could keep their current storage in addition to the free 5GB they’d get with the new service for 12 months to help with the transition.
* That promotion was set to expire at the end of September, knocking previous MobileMe members back down to the standard free 5GB. But it looks like Apple has decided to extend the deal another year…
* MacRumors, along with several other sites, is reporting that Apple has sent out emails to previous MobileMe users informing them that the complimentary iCloud storage upgrade would be good for another year.
* Here’s the email:
* “When you moved your MobileMe account to iCloud, we provided you with a complimentary storage upgrade beyond the standard 5GB that comes with an iCloud account to help you with the transition. Originally, this storage upgrade was set to expire on September 30, 2012.
* As a thank you to our former MobileMe members, we will continue to provide you with this complimentary storage upgrade at no charge, for an additional year, until September 30, 2013. No action is required on your part. For complete details, please read this article.
* Thank you again for using iCloud,
* iCloud Team”
* This is actually a pretty sweet deal, considering that former MobileMe users will be allowed to continue using their 10GB, 20GB, and 50GB of free storage. Remember, 50GB of iCloud space is $100/year.
* Apple closed the door on its MobileMe service for good on August 1st of this year.
