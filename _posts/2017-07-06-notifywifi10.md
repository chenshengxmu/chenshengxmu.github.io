* As you leave your home to visit over places, you probably bounce from Wi-Fi network to Wi-Fi network to save your cellular data. In some cases, your device automatically connects to known or trusted Wi-Fi networks, whether you want it to or not.
* A new jailbreak tweak called NotifyWiFi10 by iOS developer ichitaso is a Wi-Fi notification management platform that alerts you every time your device connects to different Wi-Fi network. It comes with a slew of features for choosing what happens after connecting to certain ones.
* After installation, you will begin to see notifications like the ones shown above when your device moves between Wi-Fi networks. These notifications let you know the SSID (Wi-Fi name), and in some cases, you might even see the local IP address inside of them.
* Notification appearance depends on whether a network is blacklisted or whitelisted; this, as well as many other options, are configured from the Settings app under the new NotifyWiFi10 preferences pane:

* Here, you can:
* The whitelist comes in handy for known networks that you trust because you won’t get notifications when connecting to these networks; these may be networks you use all the time, such as at home or work. The blacklist is where you put un-trusted networks; your Wi-Fi is automatically turned off any time your device tries to connect to one of your blacklisted networks.
* For the most part, NotifyWiFi10 is intended for those who care about their security more than the average Joe might. It aims to better communicate with you when your device jumps between Wi-Fi networks, which is something iOS normally does automatically in the background whenever they become available. To be clear, not everyone needs to this functionality; but for the handful that do, it can be useful.
* On AT&T iPhones for example, the handsets are configured out of the box to connect to AT&T-based Wi-Fi hotspots around town, which are unsecured networks. This can be concerning to some, and NotifyWiFi10 helps keep you in the loop before you start using high-risk apps, such as banking and social media, on these kinds of networks.
* Due to the nature of the tweak, it will be most meaningful to those who use multiple Wi-Fi networks from day to day rather than those who are either always at home or always at work using the same networks. With that in mind, it will be better for travelers than it will be for home-bodies.
* If you’re interested in trying NotifyWiFi10, you can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $0.99. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
