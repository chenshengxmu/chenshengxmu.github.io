* It’s been a while since we’ve featured a new weather app on here, but trust me, it was worth the wait. Introducing Tinyclouds, an adorable weather client that generates a mini world based on your current weather conditions. The app uses the Dark Sky weather service for super accurate forecasts, and if you ever get tired of looking at the mini town, there’s a more ‘normal’ view with standard weather info.
* Download for $0.99

* Tired of the average run-of-the-mill journaling apps? Check out Maslo. It’s a new type of virtual companion that makes daily reflection playful and fun. Maslo leads you through voice-based journaling, empathizes with how you feel, and finds insights in your entries that it reflects back for your personal growth. When it’s fun, fast, and easy to talk about your day, you reflect more often, learn new things about yourself, and gain perspective that helps you grow over time.

* Tired of dropping your spare dimes and nickels into the change jar? Invest it into cryptocurrency instead. Bundil automatically invests your spare change into Bitcoin and other crypto currency. Simply connect your card (the app is compatible with 100s of banks), choose the crypto coin you want to invest in, and as you make your everyday purchases, Bundil will calculate the change and invest it for you. It’s integrated with the major crypto exchange Coinbase, allowing you to make 1-time crypto purchases any time you want.
