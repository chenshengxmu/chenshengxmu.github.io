* If you’ve yet to go hands-on with the just-released iOS 8.4 and the redesigned Music app, then I recommend checking out our video walkthrough. In this video, we step through many of the new changes, from both a visual and functionality standpoint.
* I’ve been playing with the new stock Music app on iOS 8.4 for the last two hours, and I have to say I really like it. My favorite new feature is the Up Next queuing, followed closely by the mini player that allows you to keep tabs on the currently playing song while anywhere in the interface.
* Be sure to check out our iOS 8.4 release post for a full textual run down of all the new items. What’s your favorite new feature?
