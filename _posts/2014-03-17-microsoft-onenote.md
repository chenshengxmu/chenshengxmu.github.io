* The rumors were true: Windows giant Microsoft has just released its note-taking app, OneNote, for the Mac.
* It’s available right now in the Mac App Store free of charge for a limited time and includes a brand new clipper feature akin to Evernote, as well as a host of other capabilities designed to boost your productivity.
* OneNote is also available for Android, Windows and Windows Phone devices.
* As a result, your notes are platform-agnostic, synchronize across all devices, multiple people can collaborate on them and more. The full reveal is right below the fold.
* OneNote has been around for nearly a decade, but this is the first time Microsoft is offering the application free of charge, if only temporarily.
* They’ve also introduced a new feature called Office Lens that allows you to import photos of your documents and let OneNote turn images into text using optical character recognition algorithms.
* If you want to take notes while surfing the web, Microsoft now provides a OneNote clipper browser extensions for its own Internet Explorer browser, Google’s Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox and Apple’s Safari.
* Third-party developers will be able to integrate OneNote clipping into their apps via a Microsoft-provided API. And like Evernote, you can email yourself notes via your unique email account on the onenote.com domain.
* Here’s your promo clip.
* OneNote for Mac opens your existing notebooks created in Microsoft OneNote 2010 format or later and saves them to OneDrive, formerly known as SkyDrive. As a reminder, OneDrive gives you at least seven gigabytes of free cloud storage, with additional storage available for Office 365 subscribers.
* If your daily productivity depends on quality note-taking software, why note give OneNote a try? You can use the app to capture pretty much anything, from notes for classwork, meetings or research to your shopping lists, itineraries, bills and receipts – whatever pleases you.
