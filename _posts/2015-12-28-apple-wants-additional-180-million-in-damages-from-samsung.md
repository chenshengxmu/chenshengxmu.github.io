* Apple wants a Christmas present from Samsung in the form of an additional $180 million in supplemental damages (damages for infringements after the cutoff date of the jury trial), FOSS Patents reported this past weekend.
* The iPhone maker on Christmas Eve filed a motion seeking the additional $180 million on top of the initial $548 million settlement that Samsung has agreed to pay to Apple (though a reimbursement may be demanded later).
* “Samsung is not going to fork that money over without a fight,” author Florian Müeller wrote. “The amount seems high to me given that the products at issue in this case (the first litigation between the two companies) were already somewhat outdated by the time of the 2012 trial,” he continued.

* That being said, the move matches up with Apple’s strategy concerning its multi-year patent spat with Samsung as the company has been insistent that it’s entitled to damages over Samsung’s use of its patented inventions and designs.
