* I’ve always been quite partial to Spotlight, I use it all the time to launch apps that I have tucked away in a folder somewhere, and I find that it is an extremely effective way to use my iPhone.
* With that in mind, my ears always perk up whenever a tweak makes a claim that it can improve Spotlight, and ListLauncher is one such app. Just how does it work, and does it really make launching apps faster?
* Once you install ListLauncher, it just works. When you swipe your Home screen over to Spotlight, you’ll see a list of all of your apps in alphabetical order that you can tap to launch.
* While I do appreciate the tweak’s simplicity, it does have a few noted shortcomings. The first thing I noticed is that none of your bookmarks show up on your list, which isn’t a deal breaker, but it would have been a nice addition.
* Secondly, what you see is what you get, meaning that there’s no way to optimize your list, omit certain apps, change the sort order, add favorites, or anything of that nature.
* Lastly, while ListLauncher claims to help you launch your apps faster, it really isn’t that much quicker than typing the first few letters of your desired app in Spotlight.
* All in all, ListLauncher isn’t a bad tweak, it just doesn’t bring enough to the table in its current state to consider it a huge improvement over the native Spotlight launcher.

* If you have a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 4 and above, the $.99 cent price point on Cydia certainly is reasonable enough to take it for trial run, as long as you’re aware of the shortcomings listed above.
* What do you use to launch your apps? Do you find Spotlight useful, or do you simply launch your apps the old fashioned way? Sound off in the comments section below.
