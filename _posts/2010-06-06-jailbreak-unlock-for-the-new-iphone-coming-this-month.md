* Some good news just came from a tweet from Dev Team member MuscleNerd who confirmed that a jailbreak and unlock for the new iPhone, whatever its name, will be available this month.
* This jailbreak/unlock will be for iPhone OS 3.1.3 and 4.0 and will be compatible with all basebands to date for iPhone 3G/3GS as well as the new iPhone.
* I’m trying not to get too excited because history showed us that sometimes things don’t go as expected and the release of a jailbreak and/or unlock could very well be delayed.
* Still, I’ll cross my fingers.
* Wouldn’t it be great if we could get the new iPhone and not wait too long for a jailbreak? That’d sure be another reason to update. What says you?
