* The United States Postal Service approved a number of stamps today that will be printed as part of a collectible series next year. The subjects of these stamps include Nintendo’s Mario character, The Beatles’ John Lennon and yes, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.
* While any member of the public can nominate someone to appear on a postage stamp, an advisory committee must review and then select those that go into production based on subjects that are “contemporary, timely, relevant, interesting and educational.”
* Jobs has been posthumously honored a number of times since he passed away in 2011, including a Grammy Award and an induction into the Bay Area Business Hall of Fame. He has also received a Disney Legends Award and has a Pixar building named after him.
* According to The Washington Post (via Engadget), Steve’s commemorative stamp is still in the design stages and will be released at some point in 2015. Johnny Carson, Dora the Explorer and Michael Jackson are also set to get their own collectable stamps next year.
* It’s funny, I can’t remember the last time I used a stamp, and a lot of that has to do with the things that Jobs built.
