* Twitter-owned live-broadcasting app, Periscope, was updated in the App Store last evening with half a dozen new features and refinements aimed at improving the usefulness of video replays whilst improving content discovery with new tools such as an-all new Trending section to help you find content from popular broadcasters.
* Pericope also has a tvOS app for the new Apple TV and recently refreshed the iPhone version with muting, Handoff support, instant replays, finding location-enabled broadcasts, verified badges, Follower Only mode, Global section and more.
* If you own an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, press Periscope’s Home screen icon firmly to access these handy shortcuts: Broadcast (Public), Broadcast Mutuals (Private), Teleport and Search People.
* You can now skip ahead when watching a replay by touch and holding the screen and find location-enabled replays published in the past 24 hours on an embedded world map.
