* Apple announced a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro to join its existing lineup of tablets. It comes with some interesting new features and some hardware bumps, and some excellent new configurations.
* Powered by an A9X chip and sporting new display technologies like the True Tone display, a powerful 12 megapixel iSight camera with 4K video recording, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro makes for a wonderful portable workstation no matter the conditions where you’re using the tablet.
* If you’re interested in picking one up, then obviously you’ll need to know when they’re available and what they’re going to cost you.
