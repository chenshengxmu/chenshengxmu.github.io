* Apple is currently beta-testing the first major update to iOS 10 since its public release last month. Aside from a Portrait shooting mode for iPhone 7 Plus owners and a new toggle in Settings to allow Messages animations when Reduce Motion is enabled, the software update should bring official support for transit directions in Japan within the stock Maps application, Japanese blog Ata Distance said today.
* In fact, transit directions have gone live in Apple Maps ahead of official launch for both iOS 10.1 beta users and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta users.
* According to the report, users on the latest betas can now search transit routes nationwide, even reaching tsunami recovery areas such as Yamadamachi in Iwate, with multiple transit time, fare and transfer results.
* From the article:
* Apple Maps Japan cartography has been updated to show color coded train and subway lines, bus stops, completely new transit signage, enhanced station footprints and indoor mapping. Japanese Siri also supports transit route searches.
* Some indoor mapping information is still missing, like multilevel underground detail, passageways and exit information for underground stations.
