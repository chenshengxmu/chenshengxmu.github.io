* A lot of people associate Black Friday deals with frivolous, impulsive shopping, but did you know you can score great deals on larger, significant buys during the promotional event as well? Take the Mac, for example, which is being discounted by as much as $300 this weekend.
* We’ve rounded up some of the best offers we could find on various MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and iMac models. There’s something for everyone in this list, whether you’re a student in search of a budget notebook, or a professional looking for your next workhorse.
* Note that while Black Friday technically starts early Friday morning, many retailers will be open on Thanksgiving night, so look for most of these deals to go live then. In fact, a few promotions are already live, which we’ve labeled accordingly below.
* Best Buy
* B&H Photo (available now)
* eBay
* MacMall (available now)
* Stay tuned to iDB for more Black Friday sales coverage.
