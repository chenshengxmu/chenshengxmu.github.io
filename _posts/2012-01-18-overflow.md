* If you’re looking for one of the most authentic representations of Cover Flow for your iOS device’s dock, then look no further than Overflow — a tweak that lends a Cover Flow effect to existing jailbreak tweaks like Infinidock.
* It’s an impressive looking effect, and can be had if you have a jailbroken iPhone and about $2.00 to spare. Check inside as we take it for a, ahem…spin…
* Now, this certainly isn’t the first implementation of a Cover Flow style in iOS’s dock. In fact, the uber-tweak Springtomize 2 features such functionality as well, though it looks a bit different than what you get with Overflow.
* The fact of the matter is that you may prefer Springtomize 2’s implementation a bit better, depending on the type of style you’re going for. Either way, you’re going to need a tweak like Infinidock to give you a decent scrolling effect across your dock’s icons.
* In a few minutes, I’ll add a video of Springtomize 2’s implementation of scrolling for comparison.
* Until then, let us know what you think about Overflow and the Cover Flow effect in general. We know this hasn’t been the first time a tweak like this has surfaced, we’re almost certain we’ve seen something similar in the past, but this is the first time it’s garnered this much attention from the blogosphere.
* Update: Check out of Springtomize 2 Cover Flow dock video for comparison.
