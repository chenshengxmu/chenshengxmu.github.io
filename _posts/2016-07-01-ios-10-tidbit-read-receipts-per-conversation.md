title: iOS 10 tidbit- managing read receipts on a per-conversation basis
---
* iOS 10 has a new hidden switch, called Emergency Bypass, which permits you to override your global Do Not Disturb setting on a per-contact basis. It’s especially handy for those times when you wanna enable Messages notifications for a contact that isn’t in your Favorites, even if Do Not Disturb is on.

* A similar new feature in iOS 10’s Messages app makes it easy to enable or disable read receipts, which tell the other person when you’ve read an incoming text, on a per-conversation basis.
* To turn sending read receipts in a chat on or off, go to Messages, open a chat and then tap the “i” icon in the top right cornet to access options. You’ll notice a new switch right underneath the Do Not Disturb toggle, labeled Send Read Receipts.
* Sliding it to the OFF position will temporarily disable sending read receipts, meaning chat recipient(s) won’t be able to tell if you’ve read their texts.
* This is a per-contact toggle.
* Like before, you can still enable or disable sending read receipts globally in Settings → Messages → Send Read Receipts. When that switch is on, read receipts for all conversations will be enabled except for those you’ve manually disabled sending read receipts as described above.
* How do you like this little improvement in iOS 10 and can you think of a few situations that would make you want to disable sending read receipts on a per-contact basis? Hit us in comments!
