* Earlier in the morning, aTV Flash Black developers FireCore released Infuse 5.6.7, their versatile media player app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, with new features like a true black mode for iPhone X, customizable home screen favorites and other improvements.
* If you own an iPhone X, you can enable the new black mode by tapping the settings cog at the rightmost side of the tab area found alongside the bottom of the app. From there, tap General then slide the Dark Mode switch to the ON position.
* This will turn the app’s primarily white user interface dark.

* Due to the way OLED panels work (they light up the individual pixels and don’t require a backlight), a predominately black interface may help extend your iPhone X’s battery life.
* Infuse also takes full advantage of the native iPhone X display resolution allowing it to run in fullscreen mode without any black bars at the top and bottom.
* To customize your home screen favorites within the app, simply browse to a category, then tap the 3 dots and select the option Add to Favorites.

* Infuse also supports high dynamic range (HDR) video playback on compatible devices.
* The HDR feature is currently a little buggy, but don’t worry as Infuse developer James Abeler tells me that a fix is already in progress for the next Infuse update.
* Here’s everything new, improved and fixed in this edition of Infuse:
