* Yesterday ABC aired a documentary called “A Trip to The iFactory” where they tried to depict the conditions Chinese workers at Foxconn have to live in.
* We don’t want to spoil it for you, but you’re not going to learn much more than you already knew about Foxconn. However, it’s still interesting to have a glimpse at where your iPhone and iPad are made…
* To watch the documentary, go to ABC’s website.
* Unfortunately, there is no way to see this directly from your iPhone or iPad. I also doubt you can watch this video outside the United States, but you might still want to give it a try.
* UPDATE: Thanks iDB reader cruzcontrol1001 for pointing us out to this YouTube video:
* If you can’t watch the video, then make sure to read our recap of the documentary.
* So, have you learned anything new? Has this documentary changed your perception of how your iDevices are made?
