* As is always the case when a new release of iOS comes out, jailbreaking can cause a few weird and wonderful things to happen with certain apps.
* One such oddity is the way jailbroken iOS 5 devices seem unable to run Apple’s iBooks app, with tapping the icon resulting in an immediate crash.
* With the new Steve Jobs biography going on sale, not having a working release of iBooks could be a potential deal breaker for many jailbreakers out there, but as this video shows, there may be light at the end of the tunnel…
* Followers of the jailbreak scene will know the name iH8sn0w, and his latest video shows off iBooks running on a clearly jailbroken iOS device. The minute-long video shows Cydia and the Notification Center so we know that this is indeed iOS 5 and, more importantly, a jailbroken device. Then iBooks is launched – no crash, no problems.
* According to the man himself, the issue is down to the way sandboxing is handled using current jailbreaks.
* “Managed to fix iBooks when being jailbroken and running iOS 5.
* The issue was dealing with how redsn0w/sn0wbreeze did sandbox patches in the kernel. For those that don’t know, sandbox is a security measure that is used to ensure applications such as Safari don’t have access to personal information or system files.”
* The bad news? We shouldn’t expect a public release of whatever iH8sn0w did to get iBooks running on a jailbroken iOS 5 device.
* “This isn’t a stable fix. So I wouldn’t expect a fix from me.”
* The video does show that it works though, so hopefully someone else will take over and those with jailbroken iOS 5 devices can start reading their iBooks ASAP!
