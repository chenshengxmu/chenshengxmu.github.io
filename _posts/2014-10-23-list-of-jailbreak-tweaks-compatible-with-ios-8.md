* Although we’re overjoyed at the release of a jailbreak so quickly after the arrival of iOS 8, there are still a number of tweaks that are currently incompatible with iOS 8. Even now that Cydia and Cydia Substrate have been updated, many tweaks still are inducing Safe Mode when installed on devices running the latest firmware, and developers will have to release updates for quite a few of their jailbreak tweaks before they become usable.
* As a result, we’ve compiled a running list of tweaks that are compatible with the Pangu iOS 8 jailbreak. Keep in mind that the list will remain relatively small until developers begin to release updates for their tweaks, but we’ll try to keep this list current as that happens over the next while, so check back soon. Please note that you may see varied results when installing these tweaks.
* If you happen to know of a jailbreak tweak that isn’t listed here, or if you’re a jailbreak developer with an ETA on a compatibility update, please leave a comment below or email me at timothy@idownloadblog.com. The jailbreak community has also compiled a notable list of iOS 8-comptible tweaks into a spreadsheet.
