* macOS includes a super-handy Automator feature to automate the tasks you do on your Mac. Even though Automator takes advantage of ready-made actions for easy creation of complex workflows without programming, most people are unaware of its existence or what it can do.
* Put simply, Power Menu by Indian developers Fiplab is like Automator for the rest of us.
* The best thing about Power Menu: it’s a fully configurable extension that makes it easy to access powerful actions via the right-click popup menu and toolbar within the Finder.
* It comes bundled with preset actions for many missing Finder features, like moving and copying a bunch of files in one go, converting multiple images between different formats, creating new documents with a single click, compressing files with a password and more.
* More actions will be added by way of future updates.
* To avoid clutter, you can have all your Power Menu actions grouped within a single submenu. By default, the app adds actions to the existing menu and does not replace your default right-click options. Like Automator, it works with whatever folders you add.
* If that weren’t enough for you, Power Menu supports custom shell scripts that allow for virtually limitless creativity if you happen to know a thing or two about scripting in macOS.
* Power Menu uses Apple’s FinderSync Extension framework—a macOS update is unlikely to break it. You can enable or disable it via System Preferences → Extensions.
* This isn’t the first such app we’ve seen.
