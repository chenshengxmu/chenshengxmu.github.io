* Two days after it started selling refurbished iPhones through its online store, Apple has now added the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to the Special Deals section at Apple.com. Refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pros are available as well. Prices of refurbished 9.7-inch iPad Pros range from $509 for a 32GB Wi-Fi model, a saving of $90, to $789 for a 256GB Wi-Fi + Cellular version, a $140 savings.
* You’re advised to take action now if you’ve been on the lookout for discounted iPads. You can now get a good as new 9.7-inch iPad Pro for 15% off from the refurbished Apple store. These discounted items typically fly off the shelves within days or hours so it probably won’t be long before 9.7-inch iPad Pros start showing as out of stock.
* Prices of refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pros range from $679 for a 32GB Wi-Fi-only model to $869 for a 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular version. All iPad Pro refurbs are currently available in Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold finishes.
* All used products Apple sells have undergone a rigorous refurbishment process to make them good as new. Every refurbished item comes with Apple’s 1-year limited warranty, but you have the option of purchasing AppleCare to extend your coverage further.
