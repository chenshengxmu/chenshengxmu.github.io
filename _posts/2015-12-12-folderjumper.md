* FolderJumper is a new jailbreak tweak that lets your instantly access a SpringBoard folder by using an Activator gesture. If you have groups of specific apps placed within a folder that you frequently access, then FolderJumper, a $1.99 tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, can make accessing those apps easier.

* You’ll need to venture into the stock Settings app and find the preferences for FolderJumper once the tweak is installed. There, you can add a folder to the Match List, which basically consists of you providing the name of the folder that you wish to link to using an Activator gesture.
* Once a folder name is provided, simply tap on the name to assign it to a specific gesture. In my hands-on example, I assigned a double tap of the status bar to the Extras folder located on my Home screen.
* In addition to the gesture assignments, you’ll find a couple of folder animation modifier toggles at the top of the tweak’s preferences. These can be used to change the look of the folder animation to meet your tastes.
* If you’re someone who frequently uses folders, then the $1.99 asking price might be well worth it to you. It all depends on how often you access folders and the app content within them.
