* Apple on Sunday posted a press release entitled “iPhone at ten: the revolution continues.” The announcement recognizes that it’s been 10 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone, and reflects on how far the handset has come.
* By now, everyone knows the story. On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs took the Macworld stage and told the audience: “every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.” And the rest, as they say, is history.
* “iPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come.”
* “It is amazing that from the very first iPhone through to today’s newest iPhone 7 Plus, it has remained the gold standard by which all other smartphones are judged. For many of us, iPhone has become the most essential device in our lives and we love it,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone is how we make voice and FaceTime calls, how we shoot and share Live Photos and 4K videos, how we listen to streaming music, how we use social media, how we play games, how we get directions and find new places, how we pay for things, how we surf the web, do email, manage our contacts and calendars, how we listen to podcasts, watch TV, movies and sports, and how we manage our fitness and health. iPhone has become all of these things and more. And I believe we are just getting started.”
* We look back at the original iPhone unveiling every year, but there’s something special about the 10th anniversary. It’s hard to believe it’s been a decade since Apple entered the smartphone space—a category that now accounts for 60% of its revenue.
* If you haven’t watched the famous iPhone keynote in a while, you can do so here. “An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator.”
