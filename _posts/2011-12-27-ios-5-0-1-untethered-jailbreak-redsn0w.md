* By now you’ve probably read our earlier report that there is finally an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1. This is thanks to the amazing work of iOS hacker pod2g, but also thanks to GeoHot, who found some of these exploits a while back.
* As we mentioned in our previous post, there are two ways to untether iOS 5.0.1. If you’re already jailbroken, you may want to use Corona Untether 5.0.1. If, however, you’re still running a stock iOS 5.0.1 version, then this RedSn0w tutorial is for you…
* Before going forward, I advise you read our post about the specifics of this iOS 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak.
* Note that unlockers who need to preserve their baseband while updating to the latest iOS version will have to first create a custom firmware using RedSn0w > Extras > Custom IPSW.
* Step 1: Download RedSn0w 0.9.10b1 from our downloads section.
* Step 2: Plug your iDevice in and put it in DFU mode.
* Step 3: Launch RedSn0w and click on “Jailbreak” and select “Install Cydia”.
* Let RedSn0w work its magic. In just a few moments, your iOS device should reboot and run an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.0.1.
* Feel free to ask any questions about jailbreaking iOS 5.0.1 with RedSn0w below.
