* We’re adding to the stockpile of alleged ‘iPhone 6‘ evidence this morning with a handful of new photos that purportedly show a white and silver dummy unit of the upcoming handset. The device looks very similar to the slate black unit that surfaced online earlier this week.
* While the images don’t really offer up much in the way of new details on the smartphone, they do help us continue to paint a picture of what it’s believed to look like. Most everything we’ve seen thus far—from schematic drawings to case leaks—points to a homogenous design…

* These particular images were posted on Chinese website Baidu (via 9to5Mac), but beyond that, little else is known about their origin. Of course, it’s near impossible to confirm the validity of the device in the photos, but the fact it matches up with previous intel is a good sign.
* Again we see the rumored relocated Sleep/Wake button on the right-hand side of the phone. We also see the markedly thinner profile, and iPad-esque rounded corners. And on the back, the device is sporting the same circular LED flash and antenna breaks as other molds.

* For those that haven’t been keeping up with the rumors, Apple is believed to be building two separate iPhone 6 models: one with a 4.7-inch display and a larger 5.5-inch version. It’s tough to say which model this unit represents, but it does appear bigger than the current-gen.
* While there seems to be a lot of evidence in favor of the above design, it’s best to keep a certain level of skepticism (see the teardrop iPhone 5 fiasco of 2011). Here’s hoping, though, that with production expected to start ramping up, we’ll soon learn more about the handset.
