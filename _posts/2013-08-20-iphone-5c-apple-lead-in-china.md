* One Wall Street analyst has some comforting words for Apple fans watching the iPhone in China submerged under the waves of cheap Android smartphones: wait until the iPhone 5C arrives. Apple’s highly-expected budget handset dubbed the iPhone 5C could pole-vault the Apple brand into first place, overcoming Samsung and other Google-powered devices.
* The key to giving the iPhone the lead in China: the right price and wide availability. A Morgan Stanley survey of Chinese smartphone consumers suggests an iPhone costing about $486 and offered by China Mobile could give Apple’s marketshare a double-digit boost…
* Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, backed by the company’s latest AlphaWise survey, tells investors $486 is seen by Chinese buyers as “an acceptable price range” for the iPhone 5C, reports Fortune Tuesday.
* The knock against Apple in China has been its iPhone prices contrasted with sub-$200 homegrown Android devices. This is why the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S – older but less expensive – always outsold newer models.

* The second part of the equation is more out of Apple’s hands, but certainly not out of the question. Almost a third of China smartphone shoppers told surveyors that they would buy an iPhone if it were compatible with China Mobile’s 3G or 4G networks.
* Again, this finding illustrates why Apple CEO Tim Cook has made trips to China to speak with executives of the world’s largest carrier.

* In the end, Apple would gain 13.3 percent of China’s smartphone market just by introducing the iPhone 5C at a reasonable price, according to Huberty.
* Another six percent would be added if a China Mobile deal was arranged.
