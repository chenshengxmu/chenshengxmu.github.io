title: New in iOS 5- Pinch to Zoom in the Camera App
---

* We haven’t posted new iOS 5 features for a while, and even though we have already published our ultimate list of new iOS 5 features, it seems that some of you would like to hear more about each new feature.
* When launching the camera app, you can now pinch to zoom instead of sliding the bar at the bottom of the screen. It’s a nice addition, but I can’t see how this is more helpful that using the slider. Pinching requires 2 hands (one to hold the device, one to pinch), so to me it’s even less convenient that using the good old method…
* I’m sure this new feature addresses a need, so even though I don’t find it particularly interesting, some of you might.
* How do you like that?
