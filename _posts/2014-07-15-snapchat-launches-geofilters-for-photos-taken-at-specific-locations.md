* The popular ephemeral messaging app Snapchat today introduced Geofilters, basically custom filters that only work on photos taken in specific geographic locations.
* Geofilters are available by swiping to the right from the Preview screen after taking a photo. This will produce custom-designed text or graphic stickers that can be overlaid on your image to make it more attractive.
* As the name suggests, Snapchat Geofilters are location dependent and available for locations in Los Angeles and New York City…
* Snapchat explains that Geofilters change depending on which neighborhoods you’re in.
* We’ve had a lot of fun drawing up new filters for special locations in Los Angeles and New York.
* Swipe right on the preview screen to check them out – they’ll change depending on which neighborhoods you’re in!
* Check out the promotional video below which depicts Geofilters for Disneyland.
* As TechCrunch noted, Geofilters could represent a new revenue source for Snapchat though a company spokesperson underscored that existing Geofilters are free.
* The company added it “can’t comment on future plans around monetization, but [Snapchat] think[s] that the Geofilters are really fun and are excited for people to discover them.”
* Because Geofilters are location-based, you’ll need to allow Snapchat to use your location. Don’t worry, Snapchat notes that it won’t store your location on its servers.
* You can later change this in your iOS device Settings > Privacy > Location Services.
* Snapchat for iPhone is available free in the App Store.
