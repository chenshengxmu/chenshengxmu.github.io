* If you’re looking to supercharge your iPhone’s Mobile Safari browser, then look no further than Cydia. There, jailbreakers will find a plethora of tweaks to add certain features to Apple’s bare bones web browser.
* In fact, there are so many tweaks available on Cydia that it’s easy to get lost if you’re relatively new to jailbreaking, or even if you’ve been going at it for a long time.
* With that in mind, we’ve put together a list of six of our favorite jailbreak tweaks to get the most out of Mobile Safari…
* FullScreen for Safari – $2.19 This tweak allows you to enable full screen mode in Safari, along with OS X Lion like gestures for navigation. FullScreen for Safari is an extremely well thought out tweak, especially for those who lament over the iPhone’s 3.5″ screen. Learn more…
* Gridtab for Safari – $1.50 If Apple’s tabbed browsing interface infuriates you, don’t worry; you’re not alone. GridTab for Safari places your tabs in more legible grids for easy identification. Learn more…
* Tab+ – Free This tweak lends you the ability to open more than 8 tabs at once. We’re not sure what the limit is, but we’re guessing you can keep going until your device runs out of memory.
* Home Page in Safari – $0.99 The premise here is simple, you can set a Home page in Safari. Why this still isn’t featured in iOS is anyone’s guess. Learn more…
* Safari Unibar – Free A very interesting tweak that allows you to have a Google Chrome styled OmniBar to perform both searches and direct URL browsing using only one bar. The dedicated search bar is no more with Safari UniBar. To that we say good riddance. Learn more…
* Reset Safari – Free The easiest way to kill all Safari activity. Clears history, cache, and closes all tabs. Perfect for resetting Safari when it inevitably starts running slow. Check out the video below for a more in-depth demonstration.
* I know some of you may be outraged that I didn’t include Safari Download Manager. That’s an excellent tweak, that shouldn’t be overlooked. Ultimately, it doesn’t work in iOS 5, so I omitted it. Once it’s working in iOS 5, I highly recommend checking out Safari Download Manager if you want to make Safari act more like a desktop web browser.
* What do you think about this list? Is there anything obvious that I missed? Let us know in the comments!
