* One of the very first things that I tried when I got the iPod touch 6th generation (full review) was to jailbreak. To my surprise, both the PP jailbreak for Mac and the Windows-only TaiG jailbreak for iOS 8.4 worked out of the box. This surprised me because in times past, the tools used to perform the jailbreak needed to be updated to support new devices.
* With the iPod touch 6th generation, this is not so; you can jailbreak immediately. In this post, I’ll show you how easy it is to jailbreak your iPod touch 6 using the latest version of TaiG.
* Step 1: Disable Find My iPhone on your iPod touch, disable passcode lock, and enable Airplane mode
* Step 2: Connect your iPod touch 6th-gen to your Windows machine
* Step 3: Download the latest version of TaiG from our downloads page and extract it to your desktop
* Step 4: Run TaiG and it should detect your device
* Step 5: Uncheck the 3K assistant check box, and click Start
* Step 6: Don’t touch your device until it reboots after receiving the jailbreak succeeded message. You should then see the Cydia app icon on your Home screen
* If you don’t have a Windows machine, or don’t want to bother setting up and using a virtual machine, you can always use the PP jailbreak tool to jailbreak on a Mac instead. Either jailbreak tool works fine, as I’ve tested them both to confirm.
* Do you have an iPod touch? If so, would you consider jailbreaking it? Due to the speed of the new 6th generation iPod touch, I think it’s a prime candidate for jailbreakers. What do you think?
