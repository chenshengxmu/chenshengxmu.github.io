* Following a TechCrunch report which alleged that we might not see a second-generation Apple Watch released in March, as previously rumored, Taiwan-based DigiTimes reported Tuesday that the device is scheduled to enter mass production in the second quarter of 2016.
* In addition, sources told the publication that Apple Watch 2 volumes will not be high as Apple’s reduced the original device’s shipment forecast for 2016 down further from its estimate in the fourth quarter of 2015 amid weaker than expected shipments.
* “Apple originally considered shifting some second-generation Apple Watch orders to Foxconn Electronics, but decided to keep all the orders with Quanta as volumes will not be high,” reads the report.
* Quanta Computer is expected to be the sole manufacturer of the Apple Watch 2, just as it has been for the first-generation model. Still, the Apple Watch had a 50 percent share in the smartwatch market at the end of 2015.
* The second-generation device is expected to bring a faster chipset and incorporate a video camera into its bezel for FaceTime video calling though screen dimensions and resolution should remain unchanged.
