* Well-known jailbreak developer John Coates (@punksomething) has created an app that lets you add the new Apple TV’s awesome-looking animated aerial screen savers to your Mac. As we saw during the Apple TV reveal, the crew behind the screen savers were meticulous in their attention to detail.
* The locations of the aerial shots vary. Included are shots from San Francisco, China, New York, London, and Hawaii. In this post, we’ll show you how to add these same screen savers to your Mac by way of Coates’ easy-to-use tool.
* Step 1: Download the aerial.zip file from Coates’ GitHub page and extract the Aerial.saver file

* Here is what the end result looks like. Of course, these screen savers are animated, so a screenshot doesn’t do it real justice. These screen savers look amazing, and I highly recommend checking them out.
