* Vine for iPhone was updated today with a cool dark icon, a new name and same old features, making good on Twitter’s promise to sunset the service and morph it into a dedicated mobile camera software.
* Rechristened as Vine Camera and bearing version number 6.0, the app is focused on the tools that let you shoot and edit six-second videos shareable on Twitter, where they now loop. You can also add captions, save videos to your iPhone’s Camera roll and more.
* Vine Camera is available free of charge from App Store and requires iOS 9.0 or later.
* Other features available in Vine Camera include the ability to create looping videos with multiple cuts and save drafts for later while you create. You have basic features at your disposal to help you create the perfect loop, including standard Vine tools like multi-clip trimming, grid overlay, AF focus, ghost tool, flash and front-facing camera.
* All vines uploaded to the vine.co website will continue to be available and you’ll still be able to watch them looping in a web browser, but the service shall no longer accept new uploads. We have a quick tutorial for you that explains how to save all your Vine creations locally, either to your iOS device or to a computer.
* Grab Vine Camera for free from App Store. The app supports iPhone 4s and up with iOS 9.0 or later.
