* It may not be the press release Wall Street has been keeping its fingers crossed for, but Apple in a newly published media statement on Tuesday nevertheless reminded us that the new iPhone 5s and 5c are scheduled to go on sale on Friday, September 20 at 8:00am local time at Apple retail stores and at 12:01am PDT at the online Apple Store.
* Both handsets will be available from day one in the United States, United kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico Singapore and – for the first time – in China, where Apple used to deliver new iPhones months after they’d launched in the United States…
* The iPhone 5S comes in gold, silver or space gray and will be available in the US for $199/$299/$399 for the 16/32/64GB model. The iPhone 5C is available in blue, green, pink, yellow and white, priced at $99/$199 for the 16/32GB model.
* These price points entail a two-year contract with a carrier.
* In the US, the new iPhones will be available through AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, select Best Buy, RadioShack, Target and Walmart stores and Apple Authorized Resellers.
* Here’s from Apple.
* Every customer who buys an iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c at an Apple retail store will be offered free Personal Setup service, helping them customize their iPhone by setting up email, showing them new apps from the App Store and more, so they’ll be up and running with their new iPhone before they leave the store.
* Apple’s own iPhone 5s cases in beige, black, blue, brown, yellow and red cost $39 a pop. The iPhone 5c cases will be available in blue, green, pink, yellow, black and white, priced at $29. The cases are available through the online Apple Store, Apple’s retail stores and select Authorized Apple Resellers.
* Nearly half of respondents in our poll said they will be buying an iPhone 5s, with less than three percent opting for one of the colorful iPhone 5c models.

* Probably in an effort to drum up excitement for the top-line iPhone 5s, Apple only put the plastic iPhone 5c up for pre-order (here’s why). The absence of a press release announcing pre-order numbers caused some commotion on Wall Street as investors punished the stock.
* Interestingly, Apple started taking online reservations for the iPhone 5s in China, with most models and colors selling out across the country in just minutes.
* Will you be buying a new iPhone come this Friday?
