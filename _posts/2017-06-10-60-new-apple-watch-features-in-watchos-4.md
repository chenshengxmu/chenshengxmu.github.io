* Apple demonstrated a host of useful new features that will ship with watchOS 4 at the WWDC 2017 keynote, but as always, they were constrained on time and couldn’t show us everything the update has to offer.
* In this piece, well talk about everything we’ve found new in watchOS 4 so far. We’ll include everything Apple demonstrated in addition to lesser-known features that weren’t given the spotlight at the event.

* Improvements to Watch faces
* Apple is going a step further with Apple Watch faces by giving you more to choose from. These include:
* Improvements to app features
* Apple is also making the use of apps on your Apple Watch more bearable by giving them more capabilities and major performance improvements:
* Improvements for Music
* Listening to music with your Apple Watch is about to get a whole lot better thanks to these features:
* Improvements for Mail
* If you take emails on your wrist, then you’ll appreciate these new watchOS 4 features:
* Improvements for Messages
* One of the most popular uses of the Apple Watch is to take and answer text messages, and watchOS 4 brings some important new features in this department, such as:
* Improvements for Apple Pay & NFC
* The Apple Watch is NFC-enabled just like the iPhone is, so many of the new improvements to NFC and Apple Pay on iPhone are coming to the Apple Watch as well:
* New Siri features
* Siri gets smarter in watchOS 4 as she learns the following new features:
* New fitness features
* Your Apple Watch was built to be a fitness companion, and Apple is giving you more new workout features in watchOS 4 than ever before, including:
* Support for Core Bluetooth
* For the first time, Apple Watch will support Core Bluetooth, which means it can now bypass the iPhone entirely and communicate directly with certain Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as the Dexcom continuous glucose checker.
* A new Apple Watch App Store
* Apple redesigned the App Store with iOS 11, so you can expect similar changes in watchOS 4 when searching for apps via the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
* News app comes to Apple Watch
* Apple has brought the News app from your iPhone to the Apple Watch so you can stay even more intertwined with your favorite news sites – for better or for worse. The app can give you summary-based notifications throughout the day.
* Use Apple Watch as a flashlight
* If you’re wearing your Apple Watch and your iPhone is nowhere to be found, you can now use your Apple Watch as a flashlight thanks to a new Control Center toggle button. There are three modes, including white, red, and strobe.
* Format the Home screen as a list
* When the Apple Watch launched with its honeycomb-like Home screen, there were mixed reactions about it. Apple now lets you go into a scrollable list-mode Home screen instead, which may be better for those with larger fingers or accessibility issues.
* Redesigned Dock
* Apple Watch is known for its Dock, which grants access to your favorite apps even easier, but Apple has redesigned it with a vertical look and feel in watchOS 4.
* Improved Timers
* Starting with watchOS 4, you will be able to set a sub-minute timer to time yourself with more precise time measurements. You can also take advantage of a repeat function so you can time yourself over and over again.
* Improved Heart Rate indicator
* Apple Watch is a great way to monitor your heart rate, whether you’re still and at rest or you’re in the middle of a workout. For the first time, watchOS 4 will display your heart rate over time as a graph instead of as live numbers.
* Scribble in the Remote app
* Those who control their music with the Remote app on their Apple Watch can now use Scribbe in watchOS 4 to ‘type’ the things they’re looking for.
* Better notification delivery screen
* Apple Watch has always displayed single full-screen notifications as they come in, but watchOS 4 changes that by allowing you to see multiple notifications in the same screen. This will be potentially useful when someone is spam-texting you, as you were previously unable to see the content of every message.
* Updated pairing screen
* The screen you see when pairing your watchOS 4-enabled Apple Watch with an iOS 11 device will now have a new look and feel.
* Tips displayed when syncing
* Since your Apple Watch can’t be used in the middle of syncing with your iPhone, Apple has made it so watchOS 4 gives you handy tips and pointers throughout the syncing process so that you have something to look at.
* More Camera features
* Apple Watch could always be used as a remote control for your iPhone’s Camera, but now it gets the ability to switch between new camera modes like portrait and video so you can get the perfect shot.
* Accessibility improvements
* Apple noted on one of their WWDC slides that watchOS 4 will come with accessibility improvements, such as timed button presses. Although they didn’t get a chance to demo this feature, we assume this means you can time the side button and Digital Crown presses similarly to the Home button iPhones and iPads.
* New passcode button sound
* As you enter your passcode on your Apple Watch, you’ll be presented with a satisfying new sound in watchOS 4.
* Although that wraps things up for this list of watchOS 4 features, we’re sure many other hidden Easter eggs will show up between now and the official public release this Fall.
* If you enjoyed this list, we also created similar ones for both iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra so you don’t miss out on any of the new features your devices are going to be capable of.
* It can be difficult to outline everything in one post, so if we’ve missed anything, we would appreciate if you could let us know in the comments section below. Moreover, let us know what your favorite watchOS 4 feature is, and why!
