* Dropbox competitor Box updated its iOS client this morning, bringing the app to version 3.5. The update is a big one, bringing about a number of improvements and new features, including some that are specific to users with devices running iOS 8.
* The Box app now features a widget in the Notification Center that allows you to quickly and easily create Box notes and view recent documents. The update also adds support for Touch ID, so you can use your fingerprint to lock and unlock the app.
* Here’s the full 3.5 change log:
* Box is easily one of Dropbox‘s largest competitors, and from my experience it functions much in the same way. You can store pretty much any type of media or document in Box’s cloud, making your files accessible on mobile, web and your desktop.
* As usual, you can find the latest version of Box for the iPhone and iPad in the App Store for free. You’ll of course need a Box account, which is also free to setup and comes with 10GB of storage, and the option to upgrade to more for a monthly fee.
