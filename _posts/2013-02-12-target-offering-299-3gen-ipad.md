* Folks who have been looking to score a Retina-flavored iPad on the cheap will be happy to hear that Target is offering them at a massive discount. The retail giant is currently advertising the 16GB Wi-Fi only model (3rd gen) for $299.
* Not only is this $80 cheaper than Apple is currently selling similar refurbished units for in its web store, but it’s also $100 cheaper than a comparable 2nd generation iPad will cost you. We have more details on the sale after the fold…
* 9to5Mac points to the sale, which is posted on Target’s website. It appears to only apply to the aforementioned model, and it’s only available in black. It’s also marked ‘not sold online,’ meaning you’ll have to hunt one down at a local store.
* Apple released the third generation iPad almost a year ago, and it has a 2048 x 1536 Retina display, a dual-core A5X chip with quad-core graphics and a 5MP iSight camera. It was surprisingly replaced in October, by the similar iPad 4.
* Despite the fact that it’s nearly 12 months old, $299 is still a great deal for this tablet. Admittedly, it’s a bit heavyset, and Apple is said to be unveiling a redesigned iPad in the next 6 months. But if those things don’t matter to you, go for it.
* There’s no word on how long this sale will last, and stock usually disappears quickly.
