* With the iPhone 6s releasing on Friday, everyone is getting excited about the new features offered by the updated hardware. Naturally, one of the features I am most excited about is the option for dynamic wallpapers. The live wallpapers are a combination of iOS 9 and iPhone 6s hardware operability. If you downloaded iOS 9 this week, you will notice the motion wallpapers are missing from the list, due to their iPhone 6s exclusivity.
* Inside, we have still images of the live wallpapers for iPhone 6s. The images are quite stunning, even if they are not in motion. Step inside for the option to download six iPhone 6s dynamic wallpaper still images for your current device!
* The wallpapers below were gathered from @iDeviceArt. The iDeviceArt online gallery has a long list of wallpapers for iPhone, Apple Watch, and desktops.
* Unfortunately, the silver iPhone 6s blue fish wallpaper is missing from the collection. If you have a version that is at least 1080 x 1920, make sure to share it in the comments below, to complete the offering!
