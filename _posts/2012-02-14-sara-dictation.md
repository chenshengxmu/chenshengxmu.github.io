* Sara Dictation is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to have Siri-like dictation on a non-iPhone 4S device. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a tweak that allows this — siri0us immediately comes to mind — but it is certainly worth trying.
* If “Sara” sounds familiar, that’s because it is. It’s from the same developer that brought you the Siri alternative named Sara, which we covered last week.
* If you want to try Sara Dictation, add the following repo to your Cydia sources: http://isoftjsc.com
* Once the above repo address is added, you can install both Sara and Sara Dictation.
* I like Sara Dictation — not only does it work fairly on par with true Siri dictation, but it also supports a variety of languages.
* The only real downsides are that the dictation button on the keyboard isn’t Retina display enabled, and it sometimes makes the space bar appear a little funky. But those things are a small price to pay for those desperate for decent dictation capabilities.
* If you’re running a pre-4S device, and want to join the integrated dictation party, then Sara Dictation is a free solution that might just meet your needs.
* Have you tried it yet?
