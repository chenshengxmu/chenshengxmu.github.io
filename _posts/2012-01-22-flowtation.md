* Looking to add a bit more style to Notification Center? If so, then you’ve come to the right place.
* Flowtation is a recently released jailbreak tweak that does just that, adds visual style to the way Notification Center behaves when revealed.
* Instead of Notification Center overlapping the current content on your screen, it physically pushes the content out of the way when displayed.
* It’s not the easiest concept to explain with words, but that’s what video is for…
* It’s a pretty interesting concept; it doesn’t add any technical enhancements to the experience, but it’s certainly a different look and feel.
* If interested, Flowtation can be downloaded for $0.99 on Cydia, and it’s compatible with iPhone’s and iPod touches running iOS 5 or higher.
* Let us know what you think about Flowtation in the comments section.
