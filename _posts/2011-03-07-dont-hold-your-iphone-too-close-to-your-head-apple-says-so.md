* I’m sure we have all, at some point, heard about the possible dangers of extensive cell phone use. But if you’re like me, you have continuously brushed off the claims, with an I’ll-believe-it-when-I-see-it mentality. Well, maybe it’s time we paid attention.
* In your iPhone 4 booklet, about 5 pages in, is a warning about Exposure to Radio Frequency Energy. Well, it’s just your standard legal disclaimer in case a freak accident happens, right? Wrong. If you continue to read on, the user manual actually requests you hold your iPhone 5/8 inch away from your body…
* Apple iPhone 4 – Important Product Information Guide:
* For optimal mobile device performance and to be sure that human exposer to RF energy does not exceed the FCC, IC, and European Union guidelines, always follow these instructions and precautions: When on a call using the built-in audio receiver in iPhone, hold iPhone with the dock connector pointed down toward your shoulder to increase separation from the antenna. When using iPhone near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network, keep iPhone at least 15 mm (5/8 inch) away from the body, and only use carrying cases , belt clips, or holders that do not have metal parts and that maintain at least 15 mm (5/8″) separation between iPhone and the body.
* Check out your own Information Guide for yourself.  It’s there. But does this really  give us something to worry about? To be honest, this is a typical disclaimer you’ll see in most any electronic device manual that uses bluetooth, wifi, and of course, cellular radios.
* But I must say that as I drive down the road with my iPhone in my lap buzzing with text messages, and the bluetooth/FM transmitter above my head buzzing with tunes, I can’t help but wonder if there really is a danger with these devices. Before we know it, warnings will be larger and on the outside of packaging, “Surgeon General’s Warning: Use this electronic device at your own risk.”
* What do you guys think about these ‘warnings’? Any truth behind ’em? Tell us below!
