* Apple on Tuesday released the second betas of iOS 11.2.5 and watchOS 4.2.2 . Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* The rollout follow yesterday’s macOS 10.13.3 beta 2, which didn’t bring about any user-facing changes. And given that these are also .x releases, we imagine they’ll also be fairly minimal releases with a focus on under-the-hood improvements.
* We’re currently installing today’s betas, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
