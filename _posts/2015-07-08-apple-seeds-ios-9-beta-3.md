* In addition to new OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 betas, Apple also released a new iOS 9 beta to developers on Wednesday. The software carries build number 13A4293f, and is available to developers either via an over-the-air update in the Settings app, or as a standalone download in Apple’s developer portal.
* As promised by Eddy Cue last week, beta 3 features support for Apple Music—Apple’s new streaming music service. After updating, developers running on iOS 9 will be able to access the service to take advantage of both on-demand song streaming and Beats 1 radio. It also includes Apple’s new News application.
* Apple introduced News during its WWDC keynote last month. The Flipboard-like software offers a curated selection of news and other content based on your interests, wrapped in a beautiful package. Similar to Apple Music, Apple is betting big that human curation will make for a better news-reading experience.
