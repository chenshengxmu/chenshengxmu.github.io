* Almpoum is a jailbreak tweak for frequent screenshot takers. As you might have guessed, this is the type of tweak that bloggers, or anyone else that documents aspects of iOS, may find handy.
* With Almpoum enabled, users can be prompted whenever a screenshot is attempted. The prompt contains several options—save the shot to the Photo Library, copy it to the clipboard, do both, or outright cancel the screenshot.
* We’ve recorded a video walkthrough to showcase the different facets of Almpoum inside. Take a look after the break for all of the details.
* Once you install Almpoum, you should head to the stock Settings app to find its preferences. The preferences for the tweak contain a kill-switch and an options panel for further configuration.
* Almpoum allows you to establish a screenshot action—the thing that happens once you invoke a new screenshot—along with the ability to always copy screenshots to the clipboard, and to always save photos.

* Screenshots can be saved to a custom album by enabling the save to custom album toggle. You can also change up screenshot fundamentals like the screen flash, and screenshot sound.

* Almpoum is a useful tweak that contains quite a few features. Most users won’t find a place for all of the tweak’s features in a workflow, but you’ll most likely find at least one appealing item from its feature-set.
* If you’d like to try Almpoum, head on over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo and download it today. It’s a free tweak, and it works on both iOS 6 and iOS 7. Let me know what you think about Almpoum down below in the comments.
