title: Family fun night can now be played on iOS with Qwirkle
---
* Fans of board games might know about the award-wining family friendly tile game Qwirkle. The game is a lot like a mix between dominoes and rummy tile. It is simple enough to be played by kindergarteners, but challenging enough to be enjoyed by adults.

* Qwirkle has just launched in the App Store for the iPhone and iPad. So, now you can bring the fun of tabletop gaming to your digital device. Don’t worry about cleaning off the coffee table. You won’t need any extra room to play this game…
* The game’s mechanics are very simple. It was designed for players six-years or older, so you know it will be easy to play. The goal is to place tiles in a line with matching colors or shapes. Every successful tile placement earns one point.
* The game starts with all tiles face down (like dominoes). Players each draw six tiles from the pile. Then, on his or her turn, a player either plays a tile that is the same shape or color as one that is already on the board, or passes and chooses another tile instead. Players must end their turn with six tiles.
* If you match six colors or shapes in a row, it is called a “Qwirkle” and you will earn six extra points. For example, if there are five stars in a row, one in red, blue, orange, yellow, and green, you can play a purple star to earn a Qwirkle. Also, if there are five yellow tiles, but each one is a different shape, you can play a yellow shape to earn a Qwirkle, but only if all six shapes are different.

* The app features three modes of gameplay, solo, online multiplayer, and pass-and-play with up to four players. Choose from four different levels of difficulty from easy to expert.
* You can customize different aspects of the game to make it exactly the way you want it to. Change the camera angle to play in either top-down two-dimensional view, or angled 3-D. Pick from multiple backgrounds, including marble, checkered, and more. You can even customize the color of your tiles for a personalized gaming experience.
