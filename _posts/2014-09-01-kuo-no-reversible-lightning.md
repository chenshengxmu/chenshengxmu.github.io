* KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo in a note to clients issued Monday postulated that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 6 is “not likely” to ship with a more powerful power adapter.
* Furthermore, he made the same assertion regarding the rumored Lightning cable which recently leaked out with reversible design on the USB side.
* According to the analyst note obtained by AppleInsider, Kuo thinks the fully reversible Lightning cable would not be viable, citing “cost concerns” and ”limited improvements to overall user experience” that such changes would bring.
* Third-party retailer Moca.co recently said Apple had not placed any orders with suppliers for the fully reversible Lightning cable, claiming the cable would miss the iPhone 6 launch.
* The company also created a prototype USB adapter and Lightning cable, seen below.

* As for the more powerful iPhone power adapter, Moca.co contradicted Kuo by saying that the accessory will in fact be revealed alongside new iPhones at the September 9 event.
* The charger will reportedly carry a maximum output of 2A, twice that of the current adapter shipping with the iPhone, to “save you up to 30 percent charging time.”
* Here’s a video demonstration of the company’s power adapter and reversible Lightning cable.
* Moca.co is planning to ship these MFI-certified accessories in October and is now accepting preorders via its website.
* Another accessory maker, Truffol, last week launched a cable for models of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch that support the Lightning connection technology, marking the first fully reversible Lightning cable not made by Apple
* As a reminder, Apple has designed Lightning I/O to be reversible on the Lightning side. However, a fully reversible cable on both ends means there’s no wrong way to plug it into the USB port on your charger or computer as there is on the official cable sold by Apple.
