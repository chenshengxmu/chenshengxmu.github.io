* Heads up folks, Apple is giving away free copies of the popular Procreate Pocket app. You can find promo codes for the app, which normally retails for $2.99, within the ‘Stores’ section of the Apple Store app on iOS.
* For those who aren’t familiar with it, Procreate Pocket is the iPhone version of the award-winning painting app. It uses the same 64-bit Silica engine as its bigger brother, and it includes the same great set of features.

* Procreate lets you generate high-caliber artwork at a blistering pace using a robust layers system, stunning filters, and thousands of importable brushes. A must-have for serious artists and enthusiasts alike.
* To grab your free copy, simply launch the Apple Store app, navigate to the ‘Stores’ tab located along the bottom, and scroll down to the foot of the page. If you see anything else but the app icon, try swiping to the right.
* Once you’ve spotted the Procreate promo, tap on it and follow a few simple instructions to redeem your free app code. As always, availability varies depending on your country, and Apple says the offer expires July 28.
