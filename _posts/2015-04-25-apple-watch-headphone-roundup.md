* If you’re wanting to listen to music privately, directly from your Apple Watch, you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones. So for those of you who picked up a Watch this weekend, and don’t already own Bluetooth headphones, we’ve put together a list of some we think are worth checking out.
* The list contains 10 options, ordered from cheapest to most expensive, and it features various styles and price points for all tastes and budgets. It’s also been curated to only include headphones that have received positive reviews from well-respected publications, or customers on websites like Amazon.

* At $25, you obviously shouldn’t expect blow-your-mind sound from these headphones, but customers over at Amazon say they perform much better than other offerings in this price range. They also feature a comfortable behind-the-head design, built-in music controls, a built-in microphone, and battery life of around 10 hours (music and talk time). You can find the Kinivo BTH240 headphones here for $25.

* The Soundpeats are similar to the BTH240’s in that they’re very inexpensive and receive high praise by customers for being comfortable and sounding great. The key difference here is the in-ear ‘earbud’ design, versus over-the-ear, and the Soundpeats only get around 5 hours of battery life. You can find the QY7 headphones here for $28.

* If you’re wanting larger, higher quality headphones, but still don’t want to break the bank, you might check out Sony’s DR-BTN200 model. They feature two 30mm drivers for dependable sound, and a large lithium Ion battery that offers up to 40 hours of music playback. These headphones include built-in playback controls, a built-in microphone, and have a 4.5 out of 5 star rating on Amazon. You can find the Sony DR-BTN200 headphones here for $88.

* Jabra is a veteran in the Bluetooth audio space, so it’s no surprise that their wireless headphones receive high marks. After testing more than 50 pairs, The Wirecutter named the Moves their top pick for Bluetooth on- or over-the-ear headphones, noting that they are “great sounding, moderately priced, and comfortable, with easy to use controls.” The headphones feature a built-in microphone (claims Siri compatibility), built-in playback controls, and 8+ hours of talk and music time. You can find the Jabra Moves here for $100.

* Customers on Amazon have rated the JayBird BlueBuds X Sport headphones 4 out of 5 stars on nearly 4,000 reviews. The consensus is that if you are looking for sport/workout headphones in the $100-$200, or you just really like the in-ear design, you have to seriously consider these. In fact, Sebastien just bought a pair. All of the standard features are here such as an in-line microphone with built-in controls and 8 hours of playback/talk time, as well as impressive additions such as Signal Plus tech for longer connection range and a lifetime warranty against malfunctions due to sweat. The JayBird BlueBuds X Sport headphones are available here for $125.

* Like the Moves, Jabra’s REVO headphones have received great reviews for being comfortable, durable, and impressive Dolby Digital sound. They also have a built-in microphone for taking phone calls and touch playback controls, but where they differ is the REVOs can last up to 12 hours and they come with a cord with an in-line mic so you can go wired. You can find the Jabra REVO headphones here for $140.

* When you buy a pair of Beats, you’re not necessarily paying for sound or build quality—you’re paying for design. So if how headphones look are important to you, you may want to check out the Powerbeats 2. I own a pair myself actually, and I like them a lot. They’re super comfortable, deliver the typical Beats ‘punchy’ sound, and [I think] they look great. Feature-wise, they’re on par with other offerings: they’re resistant to sweat, have an in-line microphone with playback controls, and the battery can last for up to 8 hours. You can find Powerbeats 2 headphones here for $200.

* The Beats Solo 2s have that more classic, over-the-ear Beats look that you see everywhere, and have been surprisingly well-reviewed. CNET gives them 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that they are a “well-built wireless headphone that sounds good in both wireless and wired modes and [are] relatively comfortable to wear for an on-ear headphone.” Feature-wise they check all the normal boxes and the battery offers up to 12-hours of playback. You can find the Beats Solo 2s here for $235.

* Bose has long been highly respected in the headphones space, and its wireless SoundLink headphones are no different. CNET gives them a 4 out 5 star rating, saying that they “sound excellent for a Bluetooth headphone” and are one of the best wireless options available today. Of course high-end headphones have high-end features, so you get 2 microphones for improved call quality, auto-adjusting volume that moves up or down depending on your surroundings, and up to 15 hours of playback. You can find the Bose SoundLink headphones here for $250.

* If money is no object, the Sennheiser Momentum 2s are about as top-of-the-line as you can get in wireless cans. The Wirecutter says that according to their expert panel, “these are the best-sounding Bluetooth headphones hands-down.” And again when you pay a premium, you get premium features such as Noise Gard hybrid active noise cancellation tech that blocks ambient noise using 4 microphones, 2 microphones for improved call quality and 22 hours of playback time. You can find the Momentum 2 headphones here for $500.
