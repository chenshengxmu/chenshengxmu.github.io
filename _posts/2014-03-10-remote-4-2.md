* You’re probably aware by now that Apple today released iOS 7.1 with CarPlay support and improvements to Siri, Touch ID and more (jailbreakers should stay away from this update, for now).
* Additionally, the firm’s unleashed a companion Apple TV 6.1 software update with a new way to hide Home screen icons and seeded Xcode 5.1 and iAd Producer 4.1.2 (both with iOS 7.1 compatibility) to its registered iOS devs.
* And now, the iPhone maker’s free Remote app for the iPhone and iPad has received an update with support for accessing your past TV show and movie purchases and more. Remote 4.2 is available for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch free in the App Store…
* But hasn’t the previous Remote 4.1 update brought us ability to control iTunes Radio?
* Well, yeah, but today’s update refines that by controlling iTunes Radio playback directly on the Apple TV rather than by AirPlaying content from an iOS device, like before.
* And if you wanted to access your purchased movies and television shows right in the Remote app and play them on your $99 media-streaming box, Remote 4.2 does that, too. You can also play Purchased content on the Apple TV, which basically tells the set-top box to bypass an iOS device and stream your content directly itself.
* Finally, Remote 4.2 includes “additional bug fixes and stability improvements”.
* Remote 4.2 is available free in the App Store.
* The 20.3MB download supports all iOS 7-compatible iPhones, iPod touches and iPads.
* On a related note, GarageBand and Podcasts iOS apps have received a bug fix update.
* And finally, Logic Remote, Apple’s companion iOS app for Logic Pro X, got bumped to version 1.1. It adds more scale choices for Touch Instruments and introduces a new streamlined design with a darker theme that matches Logic Pro X on the Mac.
* Apple’s certainly been busy today.
