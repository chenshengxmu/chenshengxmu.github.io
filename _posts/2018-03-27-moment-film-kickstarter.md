* Moment is back on Kickstarter with their latest round of new products, this time targeting aspiring (and professional) filmmakers.
* The new crowding funding campaign is for several new accessories including a new lens, case, counterweight, and filter adapters.

* Personally, I found the new anamorphic lens to be the most exciting of the new additions. It lets filmmakers get that cinema-style ultra wide look.

* Also of interest is the new wireless charging battery case for the iPhone X. Not only does this give you additional battery for your iPhone and integration with the Moment app, it charges wirelessly so you don’t have to worry about extra cables.

* New filter adapters and universal counterweights are also up for preorder. The adapters let you get just the look you are going for, and the counterweights allow you to use a variety of different stabilizers worry-free.
* Moment originally launched the first lenses on Kickstarter, and have since become one of the go-to names for premium quality mobile glass.
* When we reviewed the wide angle lens, we were extremely impressed with the field of view it could achieve, all with zero distortion.

* You can head over to Kickstarter now to back Moment’s new products. Even if you don’t own any of their lenses, the wireless charging battery case is still worth considering. Plus, you can save quite a bit of money by preordering vs the MSRP. Moment rarely has sales, so this is something to take advantage of.
* Moment also recently launched their new “Daytrip Collection”, which consists of some pretty great mobile photography accessories from other brands including Nomad, Peak Design, and more.
