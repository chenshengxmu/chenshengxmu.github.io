* Fret not Windows users, you can now download Absinthe 2.0 in order to perform an untethered jailbreak on your iOS device running iOS 5.1.1. The procedure is pretty much exactly the same as it was for Mac users, beside a few minor details like running Absinthe as an administrator, and the self extracting zip file. Outside of that, if you can follow the steps from our Mac tutorial, you should be fine to use our Windows tutorial as well.

* Step 3: Open the absinthe-win-2.0 and right click on the absinthe.exe icon and select Run as Administrator.
* Step 4: Connect your eligible iOS 5.1.1 device, and verify that Absinthe recognizes the correct name of your device.
* Step 5: Click the jailbreak button on Absinthe, and let it run. You should see a progress bar.
* Step 6: Eventually your device will appear as if it’s performing a restore, this is normal.
* Step 7: Once the device has completed the “restore”, you should notice the Cydia icon on your Home screen.
* Step 8: Once Absinthe reports that the process is complete, you can close Absinthe and disconnect your device.
* Step 9: Open Cydia and let it configure itself for the first time. Congratulations, your iOS 5.1.1 device is now jailbroken untethered!
