* TouchType is behind the popular SwiftKey software keyboard for Android phones and the company previously went on the record expressing hope that Apple would allow third-party software keyboard development for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices.
* “The keyboard is the thing that needs work more than anything on that platform,” TouchType’s marketing chief Joe Braidwood said last summer.
* For the record, Tim Cook did promise that his company would open iOS up more for third-party developers. While the stock iOS keyboard is still off limits, TouchType is now incorporating its popular SwiftKey keyboard technology into an upcoming new note-taking iOS app, SwiftKey Note…
* The reliable leaker @evleaks just posted a purported SwiftKey Note screenshot seen top of post.
* Not much can be gleaned from the image apart from a row of tappable auto-correct suggestions right above what appears to be the regular stock iOS keyboard.
* If the SwiftKey experience on Android is anything to go by, the custom keyboard integration in SwiftKey Note should allow for a much faster typing experience with fewer misspellings compared to Apple’s virtual keyboard.
* Here’s SwiftKey 4 for Android.
* Competition in the soft keyboard space is heating up, though all third-party input methods are limited to specific apps due to technical limitations of the platform.
* For example, developer Yose Widjaja recently unveiled a Swype-style keyboard in his note-taking app Hipjot. The keyboard allows you to type and utilize swipe gestures with two hands, enabling you to complete words and sentences very quickly.
* And San Francisco-based startup Fleksy announced last December a software development kit for Apple’s registered iOS developers seeking to implement additional keyboard layouts and looks in their apps.
* A few apps now notable support Fleksy input methods, like the Google Voice client GV Connect, typing aid Blindsquare, text editor Wordbox and productivity tool Launch Center Pro, as depicted below.

* It is no secret that the stock iOS keyboard is Apple’s greatest weakness.
* It’s not that the keyboard itself is bad. Quite the contrary, iOS 7 brought out a number of refinements to make the iOS keyboard’s auto-correct and predictions a lot smarter.
* For example, keyboard shortcuts are now part of the iOS 7 auto-correct dictionary, there are new shortcuts in Safari with external keyboards, auto-correct can now fix misspellings in multiple words, the keyboard itself has been revamped and now includes a dark and light variant and so forth.
* Still, those advances pale in comparison to the openness of the Android platform which allows users to install any number of third-party soft keyboards. It’s notable that even Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak wishes the company was “more open” and “sharing with their protocols”.
* Check out an excerpt from his speech in Beijing.
* Of course, jaibroken people can easily choose from a wide variety of keyboard-focused tweaks on Cydia, but that won’t mean much to the majority on factory software.
* Wouldn’t you love to be able to fire up the App Store and replace the stock iOS touch-typing experience with a downloadable Swype or SwiftKey soft keyboard?
