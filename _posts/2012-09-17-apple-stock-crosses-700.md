* Earlier today, AT&T announced that it set a sales record over the weekend with iPhone 5 pre-orders. Apple also had a record-breaking weekend, recording 2 million iPhone 5 pre-orders in just 24 hours.
* Well apparently the early success of Apple’s new handset has given investors a boost in confidence in the Cupertino company, as its stock crossed the $700 mark today in after-hours trading…
* AAPL opened above $690 per share this morning, and after teetering close to $700 all day, it closed at $699.78 — setting a new high for the company. And then in after hours it did it again, reaching $701.
* The stock has set a number of records this year, nearly doubling in value in the last 12 months. Apple also recently became the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company of all time, with a market cap of more than $620 billion. That was in August. Today, it’s worth more than $650 billion. Wow.
* Whether or not Apple can sustain this rate of growth has yet to be seen, but the forecast looks great. The company just announced a new smartphone, alongside new iPods, and the holidays are just around the corner. And let’s not forget about that often rumored iPad mini.
* If that hits this fall, all bets are off.
