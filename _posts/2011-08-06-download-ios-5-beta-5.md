* Roughly two weeks after releasing iOS 5 Beta 4, Apple just unleashed iOS 5 Beta 5 minutes ago.
* According to Apple, in order to install iOS 5 beta 5 over-the-air, you will first have to backup your device through iCloud. Then delete everything on your device by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and then Settings. Finally, start the over-the-air update by going to Settings > General > Software Update.
*  
* You may also update via iTunes 10.5 Beta 4 by first backing up your device and downloading the full firmware, then update to iTunes 10.5 Beta 5 and restore from your latest backup.
* As usual, you can download iOS 5 Beta 5 from the Apple Dev Center, assuming you have a developer account.
* We haven’t had time to update to iOS 5 Beta 5 yet, but we’ll let you know if we find anything interesting once we do.
