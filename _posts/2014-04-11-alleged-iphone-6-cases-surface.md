* Most of the reports we’ve seen thus far regarding the iPhone 6 have pointed to two separate models: one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch. It’s possible that Apple is simply testing two different designs, and only plans on releasing one, but the consensus is that both models will make it to market.
* Adding evidence to that theory is a new photograph, which surfaced online earlier today, of what are supposed to be two iPhone 6 cases. It’s hard to tell how big they are, but it’s being said that they were made to fit new, larger iPhones, and there’s a mysterious cutout on the left-hand side of each of the cases…
* The photo was first posted by MobileFun:
* We recently received some interesting images that purport to be cases for both of the upcoming iPhone 6 models. The one on the right is for an iPhone with a 4.7-inch display, expected to be announced in June. The left case is for an iPhone with an even larger 5.7-inch display. This larger, phablet-sized model would be released in September. 
* And Nowhereelse.fr spotted some interesting details:

* Note that there’s no opening for the top-mounted sleep/wake button that has been on all previous iPhone models (2). Coincidentally, there’s a new button cutout on the left-hand side (1)—Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple is moving the button to the side this year to better facilitate one-handed use of the larger devices.
* Overall the cases match up with previous intel, as well as designs seen in alleged schematic drawings and case-maker models, but you should still take them with a grain of salt. We don’t want a repeat of the great ‘teardrop-shaped iPhone‘ fiasco of 2011, where we were misled by thousands of ‘iPhone 5’ cases, do we?
* At any rate, we’re expecting Apple to unveil the iPhone 6 in September, but several reports have suggested the 5.5-inch version will be delayed a few months.
