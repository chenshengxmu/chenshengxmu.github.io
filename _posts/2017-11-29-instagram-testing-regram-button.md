* Instagram is secretly testing a Regram button with a subset of its user base, as well as many other features coming to the platform, such as a Stories archive and closest friends lists.
* The Next Web reports that the native Regram button, found below each post, will at long last make it possible for people to reshare their Instagrams without using a third-party app or having to resort to manually saving and re-posting them from their own account.
* The company is also testing a bunch of other capabilities, some of which have been broadly available for some time now and others still being tested with a subset of users.
* Here are some of the more important ones spotted in testing:
* Last but not least, the app may present users with an Add Coffee option when they’re sharing a post on their feed. It wasn’t very clear at post time what that feature might do.
* This is GIF search in action.
* And here’s replacing certain words with appropriate emojis.
* We’re expecting these new features to roll out over the coming weeks and months.
* Have you’ve already seen some of them in action? If so, do feel free to share your impressions with us by leaving a comment down below.
