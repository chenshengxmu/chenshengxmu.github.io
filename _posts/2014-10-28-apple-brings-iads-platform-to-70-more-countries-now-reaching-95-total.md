* Apple has expanded its iAd platform to 75 additional countries, bringing the total reach to 95 countries around the world, the company announced on its Developer Center on Tuesday. This is Apple’s largest rollout of the network, and drastically increases its reach to iPhone and iPad users worldwide.
* Additional countries include those in the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia, and are immediately available to developers to begin advertising in. Apple previously expanded iAd earlier this month in European countries, bringing the total to 25. Today’s update grows it vastly.
* iAd, the Cupertino-based Apple’s answer to Google’s AdMob and Millennial Media, allows developers to create a campaign in minutes with iAd Workbench, a do‑it‑yourself campaign creation and management tool, to make revenue within their apps.
* The iAd platform has failed to gain serious ground with the developer community, so perhaps additional countries will help Apple’s cause. The rollout comes ahead Apple’s plans to rollout iAds into its Apple Pay platform, allowing customer to simply tap ads to buy new products.
