* Google’s Maps app for iPhone and iPad was updated on App Store earlier this morning with an all-new accessibility option in the form of wheelchair information available in supported cities.
* If Google is aware of the accessibility for a particular location in the United States, you’ll now get wheelchair-accessible options when searching for transit routes in select cities.
* Google in December 2016 began adding accessibility details to Maps to note if a particular location is wheelchair-accessible. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires new buildings to account for wheelchair access, but databases like Wheelmap show that wheelchair access still leaves a lot to be desired as there are still some pretty big gaps across the country.
* Google Maps is a free download from App Store.
