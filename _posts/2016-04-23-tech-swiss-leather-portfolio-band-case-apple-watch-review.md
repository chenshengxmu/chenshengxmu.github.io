* I’ve been collecting a handful of bands since purchasing my Apple Watch about a year ago, and during that time, I’ve stored these bands on my desk, easily accessible and ready to be swapped at any time.
* But as I accumulate more bands, my desk, which was never intended to store bands, is becoming kind of a mess, which is why I’ve been looking for a storage solution.
* As it turns out, there isn’t many options out there, but I recently came across the Tech Swiss Leather Portfolio Apple Watch Band Case.
* Measuring 10 3/8″ x 10 3/8″ x 2 1/8″, the Tech Swiss Portfolio Apple Watch Band Case is a solid case that can fit up to 10 watches, or in our case, up to 10 Apple Watch bands. The outside is covered with black leather, while the inside is lined with a soft beige fabric, offering an elegant look to the ensemble.
* Elastic loops tightly secure bands and keep them in place, and for added protection, a protective liner separates both sides of the case.

* I’m not much of a connoisseur when it comes to watches, and to be honest, I had never seen a watch case in person before, so I don’t really have anything to compare this to. This said, it seems to be well made, using good quality materials.
* The leather looks a little bit more plasticky than I would like it to, but it’s really not a deal breaker. The inside looks and feels luxurious. I think this is reinforced by the softness of the fabric, and the color used.
* You can fit 5 bands on each side, both being separated by the liner. When you want to close the case, simply flip one side over the other, and use the zipper to close it all.
* At 2 1/8″ high, the case is pretty thick. It is also extremely sturdy, as I assume some reinforcing materials are used to make it stronger. I imagine you could easily add a few pounds of pressure on top of it without compromising the overall structure. It’s that strong!
* Overall, I really like this case because it provides a level of protection and organization that I didn’t have before. However, I do find it too bulky and too sturdy to my taste. I’m thinking the folks at Tech Swiss could have easily cut the volume of this case in half while still offering more than decent protection.
* Traveling with such a case, for example, wouldn’t be convenient because of its size. As a case you use exclusively at home however, it is perfectly acceptable. Just know it won’t fit in just about any drawer!

* Is this a necessary investment? Absolutely not, but something tells me that if you own several Apple Watch bands, you probably want to store them in something better than a shoe box or a drawer. After spending a few hundred dollars on bands, I know I wanted something classy, elegant, and convenient to store my bands. The Tech Swiss Leather Portfolio Apple Watch Band Case offers just that.
* At $35 on Amazon, it’s not that expensive either, especially considering the build quality, which makes me feel very comfortable recommending this product should you be looking for a storage solution for your bands.
