* Oceanhorn: Monsters of the Uncharted Sea is a 3-D adventure game where players battle enemies, solve puzzles, and collect coins while exploring the island of the Uncharted Sea. Get ready for questing in this beautifully rendered mobile game…
* Players “set sail and embark on an epic journey” where they must rescue a father whose only clues to his whereabouts are a notebook and a necklace. Explore a vast, uncharted sea and learn everything there is to know about the mysterious islands.
* Combining a story driven plot with platform gameplay and puzzle solving mechanics, players are transported to a world that is not entirely unlike the adventure games that have taken inspiration from the king of the genre, Zelda.

* Using a virtual joystick (iOS 7 controller supported), players wander Oceanhorn, looking for clues that will help find the missing father. Players can interact with landscape items, like throwing pottery and cutting grass, to find hidden coins and hearts. Drop bombs in front of collapsed caves to open them and explore inside. Find keys in the grass to unlock chests full of useful items.
* When you enter caverns, you will be tasked with unlocking doors by flipping switches and moving blocks. Some puzzles require you to do both. Once you’ve figured out the pattern, you will be rewarded with an unlocked chest. Oftentimes there will be a key that you will need in a future adventure.

* The game offers more than 10 hours of adventuring as players explore every corner of the massive environment. Players earn achievements for finding items, solving puzzles, and discovering new areas. You will have an adventurers pack where you store items you will need on your journey. Use bombs, potions, and spells to get out of a sticky situation.
* Celebrity video game music composers Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito created the score, which adds to the overall experience. You’d be surprised how much of a difference a really good sound track improves your gaming enjoyment.
* Oceanhorn is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for $8.99. Download it in the App Store today.
