* If you’ve been jailbreaking for a while, you’re probably an expert in saving your SHSH blobs. The task is fairly simple and enables you to downgrade to a working firmware, if you ever upgrade and things go wrong.
* While many consider the cost of an iPhone expensive, the freedom to make it yours is priceless. If you recently updated to iOS 4.3.3, you’re certainly going to want to make sure and backup your SHSH blobs…
* Luckily, your favorite utility has been updated to join in on the 4.3.3 fun. TinyUmbrella now allows you to save your SHSH blobs, from any of your iDevices running iOS 4.3.3 (or 4.2.8 CDMA).
* TinyUmbrella v4.33 supports both Mac and Windows platforms, and can be downloaded here. It’s as easy as launching the app with your iDevice plugged in, and clicking Save. No matter how you choose to do it, please people, backup your SHSH blobs.
