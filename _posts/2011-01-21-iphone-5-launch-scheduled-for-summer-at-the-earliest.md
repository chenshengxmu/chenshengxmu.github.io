* Rumors about the iPhone 5 and iOS 4.3 have been running rampant lately. While a lot of “leaks” and speculation has been made about Apple’s major upcoming version of iOS, not much has been said about the iPhone 5’s hardware. All we’ve heard is a report from Engadget that the iPhone 5 will be a “total redesign” of the current version.
* The mysterious device is rumored to have Apple’s new A5 CPU processor, a universal baseband for all carriers, and a larger display with no home button. No specific launch date has been set, and apparently only the head honchos at Apple have access to iPhone 5 prototypes.
* The iPhone 5 was rumored to have hit the testing stage back in October of 2010, so it’s not a stretch to say that field testing units are in circulation at Cupertino. Apple has yet to divulge any direct information about the iPhone 5, but a new report claims that we won’t be seeing a product launch before summer. That is, unless one gets left in a bar again…
* Digitimes has been a pretty reliable source on Apple supply chain news. According to Digitimes, Apple is ramping up supply chains for iPhone 5 production,
* “Apple has added Foxconn Electronics, Foxlink, Gold Circuit Electronics (GCE) and Epistar as component suppliers for the iPhone 5 smartphone, scheduled for launch during summer at the earliest, according to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report.”
* The report gets specific with what component Foxconn will be responsible for producing,
* “Foxconn will become the iPhone 5’s new earphone supplier. Japan’s Foster was the previous supplier, but a strengthening yen has spurred Apple to look for more cost-effective sources, the report said, noting that related orders are estimated at NT$5 billion (US$171.7 million). Foxlink will produce earphone jack sockets for the iPhone 5.”
* Thanks to Digitimes, we have something else to add to the growing list of iPhone 5 rumors.
* Apple usually unveils the new iPhone at WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) in June, with the U.S. product launch scheduled for a couple weeks after the announcement. Sounds like the iPhone 5 should fit right into that time frame.
* We’ll be keeping you updated on the latest iPhone 5 speculation and news.
* What do you want the most from the iPhone 5? A larger display? Better performance? I wouldn’t mind to have 1080p HD video recording and an HDMI output.
