* The Cydia store wasn’t bustling with new jailbreak tweaks this week like it was the last, but there were still a handful of noteworthy releases that earned a place in the spotlight at iDB.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the new jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from March 26th to April 1st. As always, we’ll kick things off by talking about our favorites first and then outline the rest afterward for your convenience.

* The iPhone X doesn’t have a Home button, so it uses the Home Bar for app closing and multitasking gestures instead. On any stock iPhone X, the Home Bar is always a fixed size, but a new free jailbreak tweak called HomeBarSizer lets you resize it any way you’d like.
* The tweak offers both height and width adjustments inside of its preference pane, allowing you to make the Home Bar as large or small as you’d like. (Note: the screenshots above depict the stock Home Bar size.)
* You can learn more about how the tweak works in our full review.
* CCClearModulesBG: Makes the Control Center modules clear rather than blurred on iOS 11 (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* ForceAppLang: Forces a change of language in any apps you want (free via BigBoss repository)
* HideDots11: Lets you hide the Home screen and Lock screen dots in iOS 11 (free via BigBoss repository)
* Luminous: A true Dark Mode for the Snapchat app (free via BigBoss repository)

* That just about wraps things up for this week’s jailbreak tweaks of the week roundup, but remember to stay tuned to iDB throughout the week to stay up to date on all of the latest releases as they materialize.
