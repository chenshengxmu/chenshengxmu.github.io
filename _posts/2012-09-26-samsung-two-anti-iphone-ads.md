* You’ve seen Samsung marketing department’s response to the massive iPhone 5 launch. Here’s more of the same. Another one right after the break…
* Not wanting to give Samsung any more free air time, I’ll refrain from commentary but you’re more than welcome to comment on these ads down in the comments.

* Of course, Apple already posted its response earlier in the week.

* By the way, Samsung expects sales of the new Galaxy Note 2 phablet, which launched today in South Korea, will triple the original Note – even after Apple sold a record number of the iPhone 5 units in its debut weekend.
* As for its legal fight with Apple, you already know how Apple is looking to triple the $1 billion in damages the court awarded to them in August, when a California jury ruled the South Korean firm violated Apple’s utility and design patents.
* Now, according to The Korea Times, Samsung mobile chief Shin Jong-kyun is turning for help to its partner Google and major U.S. telcos.
* Samsung has already been in talks for the development of modified products aimed at escaping from Apple’s design-related patents.
* The paper goes on to note that Apple’s slowing innovation in products and Samsung’s shortened product cycle make it tougher for Apple to compete.
* Matter of fact, I’d like to hear what you think.
* Is Apple losing out to Samsung in the marketplace.
* Here, it’s a simple YES/NO poll.
* Is Apple losing out to Samsung in mobile?
* As always, feel free to explain your vote and opine on The Korea Times story and these new ads down in comments.
