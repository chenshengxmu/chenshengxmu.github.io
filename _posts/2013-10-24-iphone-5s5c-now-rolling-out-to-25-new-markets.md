* As the massive November 1 iPad Air launch across 42 global markets draws near (how about picking yours at Walmart?), tomorrow marks another key accomplishment for the company’s iconic smartphone as a bunch of international Apple Stores go offline ahead of the second wave of expansion.
* More than a month ago – on September 20 – Apple’s new iPhones went on sale in the United States and an additional ten major markets worldwide. Shortly after, Apple told us a major expansion in 35 new markets would follow on Friday, October 25 so this isn’t a shocker.
* Eager to learn whether your country is on Apple’s map? Read on…
* Online Apple Stores have already gone offline in a lot of places as Apple preps to launch the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c in Italy, Russia, Spain and nearly two dozen additional countries beginning Friday, October 25.
* The October 25 launch countries (the second wave) are as follows:
* Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, French West Indies, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Reunion Island, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and Thailand.

* Moreover, the phones are arriving to an additional 16 countries next Friday, November 1: Albania, Armenia, Bahrain, Colombia, El Salvador, Guam, Guatemala, India, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
* In each of the aforementioned markets, the new iPhones will be available across select Apple Authorized Resellers plus Apple and carrier stores (retail and online).
* Buying your handset direct from Apple has its benefits.
* Most notably, you’ll want to experience Apple’s free Personal Setup service to help you customize your device and get you up to speed by having smart store employees set up your email and settings, demo best new apps from the App Store and more.

* The company is also hosting free workshops at all retail outlets globally.
* The third wave of expansion (November 1) will make the new iPhone 5s/5c available in a total of 52 markets. The handsets originally launched on September 20 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
* By year’s end, Apple expects the 5s/5c will have rolled out to more than a hundred countries across nearly 300 carriers, an improvement over the 240 iPhone 5 carriers.
* I’d love to hear from our non-US readers down in the comments. I know iDB has quite an audience the world over so tell me, who’s buying a new iPhone, which model will you be picking and is the device overpriced in your country?
