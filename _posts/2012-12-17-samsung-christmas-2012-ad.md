title: Heres Samsungs Christmas ad that will ruin your childhood

* Not sure whether or not you saw Samsung’s TV ad starring Santa and Mrs. Claus where the characters share their sex tape using “the magic of S Beam on the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II”.
* I know it’s a rehash of Samsung’s earlier (and pretty funny) take on a sex tape exchange between a guy and his wife. Let’s be clear – I have absolutely no problem with sex in advertising, but that’s a preposterous thing to air as we head into Christmas.
* Just what exactly are kids supposed to think after being exposed to such a dramatized sexual innuendo involving their childhood hero? Seriously, what’s next? A sexting Santa commercial? Thanks for ruining my childhood, Samsung!
* The commercial was posted to YouTube last week (via Gizmodo).
* Good ol’ Sammy didn’t stop there, their holiday playlist on YouTube contains another clip that pokes fun of Santa.

* Other ads are nicer. This one, for example, works much better.

* I saved the best for last: it makes a clever use of the beautiful art of Kirigami.
* Finally, this is the original sex-induced sharing ad from last month, dubbed Work Trip.

* As much as some folks – myself included – may criticize these ads for being in bad taste, Samsung’s marketing has certainly sent the tongues wagging all over again, no?
* Let’s revisit Christmas 2011 when Apple aired this puritan holiday ad.
* And Best Buy’s FaceTime and Santa commercial from three weeks ago.

* So, is Samsung’s holiday campaign appropriate for the Christmas spirit?
