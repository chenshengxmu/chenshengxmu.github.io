* A new teaser video has surfaced on YouTube that appears to show an iPhone 5s being successfully downgraded from iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 9.3.2.
* The video demonstrates the use of a third-party tool that the creator is calling Prometheus, but it also brings up a lot of questions that still have yet to be answered.
* If this is legitimate, this would be the first major breakthrough downgrade process for 64-bit iOS devices, which is a huge feat in itself, but the ability to downgrade would breathe some much-needed new life into the jailbreak community as a whole.
* Little is currently known about the inner workings of the Prometheus, but what we do know so far is it seems to utilize Apple’s APTicket and SHSH blob system. Moreover, it’s only compatible with 64-bit devices, and not 32-bit devices.
* You can watch the magic in the video embedded below:
* In the video description, the creator says “other conditions” must also be met, but no additional details have so far been released as of this writing, so it’s unknown what else other than saved APTicket and SHSH blob information might be required.
* “It is currently unknown what conditions have to be met to be eligible for downgrade without jailbreak,” hacker tihmstar, the creator of the tool, explains.
* One thing that will probably grind a lot of people’s gears is the simple fact that because it relies on saved APTickets and SHSH blobs, most people probably wouldn’t even be able to use Prometheus.
* Why do we say that? Most people went about their lives, ignoring the recommendation to use third-party tools like TinyUmbrella, because it has been essentially useless for the last few years after downgrading iOS devices was no longer possible.
* Despite how many questions there currently are about how this process works, and whether or not Apple would be able to patch it in a jiffy, there simply isn’t enough information right now. You’ll just have to judge for yourself.
