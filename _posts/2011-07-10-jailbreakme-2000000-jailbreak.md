* JailbreakMe was released just a few days ago and has already had fulgurant success. Twelve hours after its launch, 500,000 iDevices had already been jailbroken. Fastforward a few days later, and JailbreakMe has now been used over 2,000,000 times.
* The news that came this morning via Chpwn’s Twitter account reveals with a quick calculation that JailbreakMe is responsible for jailbreaking 1% of all iPhones, iPads and iPods in the world…
* According to Apple, there are about 200,000,000 iDevices in the world. If JailbreakMe helped jailbreak 2,000,000, it represents about 1% of the total devices.
* While this 1% number might not be impressive at first, you have to take into account that JailbreakMe was released just 5 days ago. Additionally, JailbreakMe is not the only jailbreak available as you can currently jailbreak most iOS 4.3.3 devices with either RedSn0w, PwnageTool, and Sn0wBreeze.
* At the end of the day, JailbreakMe might very well be the most popular jailbreak ever released. It sure is the fastest and easiest one. If you used JailbreakMe to jailbreak one or more of your iDevices, it’d be nice to make a donation to Comex. Anything helps.
* Are you impressed by these numbers?
