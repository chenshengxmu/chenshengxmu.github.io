* Instahancer is a new jailbreak tweak that enhances the usability of the iPhone’s Instagram app. It does so in a vein similar to another recently released jailbreak tweak called InstaSave, a tweak primarily focused on saving photos from the service.
* While this tweak, too, focuses on saving Instagram photos, it attempts to justify the price premium with the addition of extra features like zooming, caption drafts, and the ability to copy direct URLs. Does Instahancer succeed in its endeavors? Take a look inside for the full scoop…

* If you’re an Instagram junkie, then absolutely. You’ll be thrilled with the variety of options presented when you tap and hold on a favorite photo. Options to save, attach to email, copy to clipboard, copy link to clipboard, and zoom, can all be useful to fans of the service.
* Along with those options, there’s “open in…” capability for photos contained within your camera roll. Yes, Instahancer allows you to import photos directly from your camera roll to Instagram’s editor. Options like a custom Instagram album for saved photos, tap and hold delay, and drafts for photo captions, also make the cut.
* If there’s one gripe I have with Instahancer, it’s a minor one. The tweak’s pull to refresh feature doesn’t appear to work properly, at least it didn’t on two of my jailbroken devices. Hopefully this issue will be remedied soon.
* Instahancer is without a doubt the best way to get more out of Instagram with a jailbreak tweak. If you’re addicted Instagram, then skedaddle over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo, and purchase it today for $0.99. What do you think about Instahancer?
