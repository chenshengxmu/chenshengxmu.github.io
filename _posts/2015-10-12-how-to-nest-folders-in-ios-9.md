* Since folders first appeared on iOS, there have always been glitches that make it possible to place a folder within a folder. iOS 9 is no different, it too allows you to nest folders on your iPhone. To do so is extremely easy, and requires no quick movements, or ridiculous over the top finger cramping combinations methods.
* The only downside about using this method to nest folders is that you’ll have to do it all over again when you restart your iPhone. In this post and video, I’ll show you how simple it is to nest folders on iOS 9 in just a few seconds.
* Step 1: Place your destination folder on a top row on the Home screen.
* Step 2: Place the folder you wish to move on the same page as the destination folder.
* Step 3: Enter wiggle mode by long-pressing the folder you wish to move, and continue to hold the folder.
* Step 4: While holding the folder you wish to move, tap the gap between the folder and the status bar right above the destination folder using another finger.
* Step 5: The destination folder should open. From there, just drag the folder you wish to move into the destination folder and release.
* That may seem like a lot of steps, but it only take a few seconds. I highly recommend watching the video above to see how easy it is.
* Remember, if you restart, you’ll have to do this all over again. That’s always been the case with glitches like this, so that should come as no surprise.
* What do you think?
