* In what may be the first sport chain retailer to sell Apple Watch, Canada’s Sport Check stores are now selling Apple Watch. Sport Check files as the country’s largest sport retailer.
* As first noted by PatentlyApple, the Apple Watch listing over at the official Sport Check website now has the latest Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Nike+ models on sale, in addition to the previous-generation Apple Watch hardware.
* The new Sport Chek ads for Apple Watch began hitting the market last week.
* It would seem that selling Apple Watch through specialized sport retailers may be a new thing. At any rate, we’ll keep you informed if the Cupertino company expands this latest initiative to sport retail chains elsewhere.
