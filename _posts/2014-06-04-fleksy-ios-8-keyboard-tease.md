* Aside from customizable Share sheets and support for third-party Share Extensions, downloadable soft-keyboards is yet another feature making iOS 8 more flexible and way more customizable than ever.
* As we explained yesterday, registered iOS developers can now use Apple’s iOS 8 SDK to write software keyboards and distribute them in the App Store. And users will be permitted to download any third-party keyboard they like.
* This will make it dead simple to finally use new input methods system-wide. I bet you didn’t see downloadable iOS 8 keyboards coming! Apple’s promotional graphics shown at Monday’s keynote and used on the iOS 8 webpage has already hinted at a downloadable Swype keyboard.
* And just this morning, an image tweeted out by its developer has confirmed that the popular Fleksy Android keyboard will be available when iOS 8 launches this Fall…
* Note: the top image from Apple’s website depicts the Swype keyboard.
* “Fleksy is already running on iOS 8,” teases the tweet.
* You can register for the beta over at the official Fleksy website and you’ll receive an email invite when it opens.

* Where did the Dictation key go?
* Nowhere, because iOS 8 currently prohibits programmers from developing software keyboards that access dictation by way of APIs. Moreover, soft-keyboard makers are not allowed access to Apple’s APIs for automatic capitalization and autocorrect suggestions, so developers must replicate this functionality on their own.
* Although Fleksy currently offers an SDK to other app developers to implement its keyboard, with iOS 8’s support for downloadable software keyboards Fleksy’s SDK is bound to become a thing of the past.
* Yesterday, Fleksy confirmed on Twitter that it has started work on bringing its predictive touch keyboard keyboard to iOS 8.
* In addition to Fleksy, Swype and SwiftKey iOS 8 keyboards are in the works as well, Re/code confirmed yesterday.
* iOS 8 also brings Apple’s all-new QuickType keyboard with smarter suggestions. QuickType learns from your writing style on a per app/contact basis and offers suggestions based on the slang and words you use. It will be available in fourteen languages at launch.
* As for the stock iOS 8 keyboard, it’s gained support for Indian, Tagalog, Irish Gaelic and Slovenian languages. As a nice bonus, Apple is throwing in a brand new Braille keyboard for direct 6 dot braille input.
