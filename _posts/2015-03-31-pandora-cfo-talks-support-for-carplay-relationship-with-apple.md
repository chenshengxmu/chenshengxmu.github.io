* Pandora revealed on Tuesday it has plans to launch its online music radio on Apple’s CarPlay, the in-car infotainment software set to be found in several vehicles on the market.
* While Pandora is a little late to the party, as CarPlay launched in 2014, it’s a seemingly perfect app to fit the car software. Many users already utilize the Pandora app on their iPhone to play music through their car’s speakers.
* In an interview with Fox Business, Pandora CFO Mike Herring said “we’ll definitely be in CarPlay,” meaning users would be able to launch the Pandora app through the in-car dash, rather than their phone.
* Herring didn’t give any specifics on a launch date, and we’ve reached out to Pandora for more details. However, it’s still nice to hear an official confirmation from the company.
* In the interview, Herring also touched on Pandora’s relationship with Apple, who’s behind similar service iTunes Radio and who’s rumored to launch a Spotify competitor in the coming months. Herring said there’s a “frenemy kind of relationship going on” with Apple and that Pandora was “part of what made it fun to have an iPhone.”
* Herring added that while the two companies are “close partners,” it’s a “very interesting relationship.”
