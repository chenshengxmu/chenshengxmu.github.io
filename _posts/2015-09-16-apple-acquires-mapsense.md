* Apple has acquired Mapsense, a San Francisco-based startup that specializes in tools for analyzing and visualizing location data, Recode reports. A spokesperson confirmed the buyout, saying “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.”
* The deal is said to be worth anywhere between $25 million and $30 million, and it includes Mapsense’s 12-person team and technology. That tech includes a cloud-based tool that allows users to manipulate graphical models of maps that hold huge sums of data, and a recently launched platform for developers.

* Mapsense is just the latest in an onslaught of maps and GPS-related acquisitions for Apple in recent years. In 2013, it picked up crowd-sourced mapping software Hopstop and location-based startup Locationary, and earlier this year it bought out Coherent, which was working on improved High Integrity GPS tech.
