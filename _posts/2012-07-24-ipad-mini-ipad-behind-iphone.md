* Following up his bold predictions regarding the future of the iPod line, the often accurate Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has offered up his forecast for what will become of Apple’s tablet line as well.
* The analyst agrees that Apple is going to unveil an all-new, smaller slate this fall. But he also believes that the new tablet will launch alongside a tweaked version of the current third-generation iPad…
* MacRumors, again, points to the report:
* “Though shipments of iPad mini’s components will start in August, the new iPad line will end production, read for transition to a modified New iPad line. As such, component shipments will drop in August as iPad mini’s components shipments growth will be offset. On a side note, the modified New iPad shares the same exterior as the original model, but contains modifications to correct its thermal dissipation problem and lower-cost components.”
* Koh believes that we’ll see the smaller iPad debut in late September, just behind the next-gen iPhone. In addition, he also appears to agree with earlier speculation that Apple has been tweaking its Retina iPad.
* Back in May, DigiTimes reported that Apple was looking to launch a reworked version of the current iPad in late summer, with a new IGZO display and better heat dissipation. If there’s any truth to this rumor, it’s more likely that the change will go largely unnoticed by consumers, similar to the retooled iPad 2 that appeared back in March.
* At any rate, with new iPods, iPads, and a new iPhone all on the menu for a possible September-October launch, this holiday season is certainly shaping up nicely for Apple. The only question is, can it live up to all the hype?
