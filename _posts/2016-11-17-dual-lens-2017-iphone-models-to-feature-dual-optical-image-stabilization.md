* Apple’s single-lens iPhone 7 and dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus both support the optical image stabilization (OIS) feature for taking sharper images and capturing stabilized videos. Next year’s dual-lens iPhone models, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, will support OIS on both the the wide-angle lens and the telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 Plus supports auto focus on both cameras on the back, but only the wide-angle lens is outfitted with OIS.
* An excerpt from Kuo’s note reads:
* We believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year’s new iPhone. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners.
* The analyst believes that adding OIS functionality to the telephoto lens could improve photo quality and increase optical zoom range from the current 2x optical zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus.
* Another report from Kuo earlier in the morning predicted the the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus will get a glass casing instead of metal in 2017 refresh, with a rumored OLED iPhone joining the mix as the new flagship model.
* The OLED iPhone, Kuo said, should use a 5.8-inch wraparound panel that will have “active display area” of about 5.2-inches diagonally. Another KGI report two days ago alleged that that both a 5.5-inch ‘iPhone 7s Plus’ with a TFT-LCD screen and the rumored OLED iPhone would pack in dual cameras while a 4.7-inch ‘iPhone 7s’ with an LCD screen would have a single-lens module.
