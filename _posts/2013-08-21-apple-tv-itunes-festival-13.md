* Back in May, Apple announced details for its upcoming iTunes Festival. The company has been sponsoring the event, which consists of a monthlong series of free concerts from high-profile artists, for the past five years.
* This year’s Festival is going to be held at The Roundhouse in London, during the month of September. And as Apple prepares for the festivities, it has posted a streaming channel to Apple TV, and updated the iOS app…
* Like last year, Apple has added a new channel to the Apple TV, located on the main menu, which will allow users to watch live streams of Festival concerts. The shows will also be available for a limited time on demand.

* Additionally, the iPad-maker has updated its iTunes Festival iOS app with a “refreshed design.” Like the ATV channel, users will be able to use the mobile app to watch live streams and access on demand concert content.
* Apple says that this year’s Festival will be “the best ever,” with global super stars like Justin Timberlake, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and Jack Johnson slated to perform throughout the month. The event kicks off on September 1.
