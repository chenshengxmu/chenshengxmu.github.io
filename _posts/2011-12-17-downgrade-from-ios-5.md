* Are you growing tired of waiting for an iOS 5 jailbreak? Do you wish you could go back to the good old days of iOS 4.3.3, when jailbreaking was simple? If you answered yes to either one of those questions, you might be interested in TinyCFW.
* TinyCFW is a new downgrading tool by TinyUmbrella-creator NotCom. Using your saved SHSH blobs, you can use TinyCFW to downgrade your iPhone 4 or iPad 2 to iOS 4.3.3 so you can go back to having an untethered jailbreak.
* NotCom explains:
* “TinyCFW is a simple tool I put together for a friend of mine. He has an iPad 2 GSM and has his 4.3.3 SHSH but since Apple is no longer signing 4.3.3, it isn’t possible to downgrade to 4.3.3 without getting stuck in a 1015 recovery loop.
* – It will modify an existing IPSW for an iPad 2 GSM/CDMA or iPhone 4 GSM/CDMA
* – It WILL modify the IPSW to update your baseband to the latest
* – It will create an IPSW that you can use with TinyUmbrella AND iTunes to restore to a version of iOS that you have SHSHs for
* – It is primarily for iPad 2 with a baseband OR iPhone 4.
* NotCom also warns that he never intended TinyCFW for public release. It was just a tool he made for a friend that he figured he would share with others looking to do the same thing. He says we can expect its functionality in far more robust form in TinyPwn, a future release.
* We hope to have a TinyCFW tutorial up soon. But for those who want to give it a shot beforehand, you can grab the utility from our Downloads page. If you get stuck, NotCom has some light instructions for using TinyCFW on his website.
