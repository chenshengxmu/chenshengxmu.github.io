* Most of us remember going to the arcade as kids. But gaming has changed a lot since those old coin operated machines. Now most of our video games can fit in our hands and pockets.
* If you’ve been longing for a way to relive the good old days, iCade might be just what you are looking for. What started out as an April Fools day joke last year has become a must have accessory for any iPad-toting arcade fan.
* ThinkGeek is well known for their offerings of goofy gadgets. Their products range from wrist chargers to light sabers, and everything in between. They could be on to something though with one of their latest inventions, the iCade.
* Essentially the product looks like a mini arcade system. It contains a joystick and 8 buttons, as well as a place for your iPad to sit vertically. iCade pairs with your iPad via bluetooth and allows you to play games via the arcade controls.
* The product is currently listed as shipping in early June for $99.99. The iCade will initially only be able to work with select games inside the Atari iPad app, but the code will be available to developers for future implementation. Check out the video below to see the iCade in action at CES earlier this year.
* What do you think of the iCade?
