* If you currently have an A4 device or below that’s jailbroken on iOS 5.1.1 using a tethered jailbreak, you can use the new Rocky Racoon 5.1.1 Untether package to convert your tethered jailbreak into an untethered jailbreak.
* This is great, because you don’t have to perform any sort of restore on your already jailbroken device just to change it into a jailbreak of the untethered variety. Even better is the fact that you can download Rocky Racoon from Cydia, and install it just like you would any other package to accomplish an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1.
* Inside, we detail the brief steps involved to convert your existing jailbroken device running iOS 5.1.1 into an untethered jailbreak. Join us…
* Note: Your device must be jailbroken using RedSn0w for iOS 5.1.1 to perform a tethered jailbreak first. To do this, see our iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak tutorial for RedSn0w. If you’re not already jailbroken using RedSn0w, follow our Absinthe 2.0 tutorial instead.
* Step 1: Open Cydia.
* Step 2: Search for Rocky Racoon 5.1.1 Untether and install.
* Step 3: Reboot your device and verify that you can reboot without having to perform a tethered boot.
* You could always restore your device, and perform a jailbreak using Absinthe 2.0, but there’s no need to do this since you can just use Rocky Racoon to convert your jailbreak over to untethered! A5 users (iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPad 3) will not be able to use this initially, because there was no tethered jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1 to begin with. A4 users (iPhone 4, iPhone 4S) and iPhone 3GS users should be able to take advantage of Rocky Racoon with no issues.
* Be sure not to uninstall Rocky Racoon 5.1.1 Untether, because all devices depend on this package to maintain the jailbreak.
* Let us know if the Rocky Racoon jailbreak worked successfully for you in the comments section below.
