* Siri has certainly been at the forefront of tech news over the last few weeks. Since Apple introduced the digital assistant at its iPhone 4S event in October, it seems to be everyone’s favorite subject. And the question on everyone’s mind is, can it be ported to other devices?
* To make a long story short, yes, it can. Although it’s not available to the public (and likely won’t be for some time, if ever), developers have managed to successfully port Siri to the iPhone 4. And as we’ve seen, it works really well. But why stop there?
* Prominent jailbreak developer Ryan Petrich sent out an interesting tweet this morning saying that he had ported Siri to his iPhone 3GS with the help of chpwn and Steven Troughton-Smith. He even posted a video of the assistant functioning on his two-year-old handset, which you can see for yourself below.
* He also said that he’s working on integrating his popular jailbreak tweak, Activator, with Siri. Interesting.
* As aforementioned, it’s not likely that we’ll see Siri turn up on Cydia anytime soon. On top of the legal ramifications, there are several other hurdles keeping a port from reaching the masses. But at least we know it’s possible. Everything has to start somewhere, right?
