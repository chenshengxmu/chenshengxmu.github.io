* Japanese blog Mac Otakara heard last month from unverified sources in the Taiwanese supply chain that Apple might be developing a new Jet White color option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus series.
* Yesterday evening, avid Apple leaker Sonny Dickson posted a video on Twitter that shows off glossy white iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus casing mockups, giving us an indication what the rumored Jet White colorway might look like. The mockups were clearly obtained from a third-party vendor and we’re posting them for the discussion’s sake.
* Based on Dickson’s comment on Twitter, he’s unsure about the accuracy of the sketchy video. “Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7?”, reads his tweet.

* Like many iPhone 7 mockups we saw in the run-up to the official introduction, this is most likely a third-party mockup obtained from one of Chinese resellers. For instance, the iPhone 7 model shown on the video does not have an Apple logo on the back.
* Assuming Apple has been indeed working on a Jet White colorway for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the new color option may become available some time next year. In the past, the Cupertino company had famously spent months getting the appearance of the white iPhone 4 model right before making it available for purchase.
* What do you guys think?
* And while we’re at it, would you consider a Jet White iPhone 7?
