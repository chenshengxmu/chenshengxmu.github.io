* To me, calculator apps are a lot like weather apps – I can never get enough of them. In an effort to help you increase your mobile productivity, Apple is now featuring several great third-party calculators in an App Store section titled Productivity Monday.
* Featured iPhone and iPad software includes both paid and free calculators, including the gorgeously designed minimalist Digits app with the ability to edit complex calculations and get instantly updated results…
* You can check out the five showcased iPhone and iPad calculator apps directly, by clicking this iTunes URL. I’ve created handy app descriptions along with relevant screenshots and their respective App Store links right below, hopefully you’ll find them useful.
* Digits [Universal, $0.99] by Joshua Distler and Shift looks like a minimalist app though it’s anything but basic. Designed as the “calculator for humans,” the app has a correctable tape allowing you to edit any entry, insert new calculations, copy results and even label items in your tape and include comments in tape emails. This makes it easy to calculate a couple of different scenarios by editing any previous entry to automatically update the total. The app is discounted to 99 cents for a limited time (regularly $1.99).

* Calc [Universal, Free] by QApps LLC is a scientific calculator that “makes doing math look like art.” Functionally and aesthetically, it’s one of the best calculators on iOS, featuring colorful themes, a bunch of shortcuts via tap-and-holding, a built-in converter of currencies and 21 common categories, a history log (just swipe up) and other perks. It’s smart, too, with its support for live math expressions. As a bonus, there’s a handy timer to help your track your remaining time during a test or workshop.

* Tydlig [Universal, $2.99] by Andreas Karlsson is a unique freeform iOS calculator that starts with a clean sheet [quick review]. It sports only UI components that truly makes sense on mobile devices though it’s packed to the gills with an array of advanced features. Tydlig’s key selling point: you can select a result and tie any operation to it in order to create a linked number on the line below. Then, responsive results and any changes to any of the values will cascade down these links. How cool is that?

Simply write your mathematical expression on the screen like you would on a piece of paper and the app will turn handwriting into the results, from simpler to most complex arithmetic operations and formulas.

* Soulver [Universal, $1.99] by Acqualia Software is the Fantastical of calculators of sorts. Rather than requiring you to tediously punch in your values and operations, Soulver uses natural language to parse your spoken queries. It lets you work with values across multiple lines, supports various currencies and units, allows you to type units manually (like “USD”, “dollars” etc.), plays nice with iOS 7, features syntax highlighting with color-coding for operations, values and individual bits of text and lost more.
