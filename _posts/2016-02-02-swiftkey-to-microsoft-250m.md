* Microsoft is buying out software keyboard maker SwiftKey, according to a report from The Financial Times. The deal is said to be worth $250 million, and the two companies are expected to officially announce the acquisition later this week.
* While Microsoft has shown interest in the mobile keyboard space, the report claims that the purchase is all about AI. SwiftKey uses artificial intelligence to predict the next word a user is going to type based on an analysis of their writing style.
* Swiftkey is the latest in a string of UK start-ups with advanced artificial-intelligence capabilities to be snapped up by the biggest names in Silicon Valley.
* […] A person close to the deal said: “There’s a war for talent in artificial intelligence — and companies like Google and Microsoft recognise the best talent is in the UK.”
* SwiftKey is just the latest in a string of popular app acquisitions by Microsoft in recent years. The Redmond-based company has a particular affinity for productivity apps, picking up email client Acompli, Wunderlist, and Sunrise calendar app.
