* Interesting news for those who like to keep tabs on domain names – a noble cause indeed – with reports that Apple is now the proud owner of two new URLs.
* According to Fusible, and in turn TechCrunch, both iPhone4.com and WhiteiPhone.com are now owned by the Cupertino web masters, with the two addresses already pointing to Apple’s iPhone 4 product page…
* As Fusible points out, Apple does not currently own domains for any subsequent iPhone products, so no iPhone 5,6,7 or indeed 4S.com addresses.
* Having been originally announced back in June of 2010, the iPhone 4 has become an iconic product for the guys and gals at Apple, with more units sold than Steve Jobs has pairs of blue jeans.
* Why it has taken Apple so long to get around to buying a domain for the iPhone 4 remains a mystery. Considering the next iPhone is believed to be close to giving an appearance, we have to wonder if it was even worth the bother to buy iPhone4.com at this point.
* It’s also worth noting that Apple doesn’t yet own iPad.com, nor iPhone3GS.com. It does, however, own the iPhone.com domain, which it bought back in 2007 for a rumored $1,000,000.
* Guess that’s why we aren’t working at Apple, though.
* Any guesses how much iPhone5.com is worth right now?
