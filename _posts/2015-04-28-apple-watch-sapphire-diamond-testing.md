* After quite literally subjecting the Apple Watch Sport’s Ion-X glass to the knife in a  recent scratch test video, YouTuber ‘Unbox Therapy’ is back with another cool test.
* This time around, he’s evaluating the Apple Watch’s sapphire-coated screen with a diamond tester and comparing it to the Apple Watch Sport, LG’s G Watch R, the iPhone 6 and a high-end analog watch by Tissot, which uses sapphire for protection.
* He came away fairly impressed with Apple’s sapphire, concluding it does match those of classic sapphire watches. Sapphire, for those wondering, is the second-hardest transparent substance after diamond. Have a look at the video and tell us what you think in the comment section.
* By the way, he used a $12 diamond tester purchased on Amazon.
* The gadget basically determines the conductivity of various materials and is used mostly for evaluating jewelry and precious gemstones like diamonds.
* While standard glass doesn’t give a reading with the diamond tester, sapphire is a very conductive material and typically gives a readout of about 7 or 8 on the scale. So how did Apple’s sapphire fare in this test? Is Apple’s a legitimate sapphire crystal?
* Have a look yourself below.
* Again, the Apple Watch Sport, LG G Watch R and iPhone 6 didn’t show a reading because these devices feature ion-strengthened glass screens.
* The key takeaway here is that Apple’s standards for sapphire crystal used in the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition match up with traditional watchmakers.
* Quality matters so this serves as a testament to the craftsmanship of the Apple Watch and the great lengths Apple’s gone to get its sapphire right and bring it to market.
* “Our sapphire crystal comes from the highest-quality boules. Only the purest, clearest, and strongest sapphire crystal is harvested,” reads ‘s Watch Craftsmanship webpage.

* “To ensure a precise fit for the case, the crystal is cut using a diamond-encrusted wire. To make room for an integrated antenna, a tiny groove is laser-ablated around its perimeter. And to create the smoothest possible finish, the crystal is polished with diamond-covered pellets.”
* Unbox Therapy gained worldwide fame — or notoriety, depending on your point of view — with a widely circulated and reblogged stress-test video showing the iPhone 6’s bend-ability, which then sparked the whole Bendgate nonsense.
* What’s your take on this non-scientific sapphire test?
