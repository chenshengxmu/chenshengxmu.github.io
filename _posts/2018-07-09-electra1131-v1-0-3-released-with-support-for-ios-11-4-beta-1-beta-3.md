* On Monday, the Electra Team posted yet another update for the Electra1131 jailbreak tool to their official website.
* Citing the official changelog, Electra1131 version 1.0.3 adds support for iOS 11.4 beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3, but this only appears to work reliably when using the developer-only multipath tcp version of the tool.
* A Tweet shared by the Electra Team’s Twitter account shortly before the release highlights that iOS 11.4 beta 3 is still being signed on the iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and iPhone X and that users can downgrade to it if they fancy fast access to an iOS 11 jailbreak:

* Electra Team member CoolStar later added that this is the first time in more than a year that the community has had access to a jailbreak for a signed firmware version:

* Notably, Apple released iOS 11.4.1 as a software update for its mobile devices on Monday, a firmware that Electra1131 does not currently support. Jailbreakers are advised to avoid iOS 11.4.1, as it patches valuable exploits used by the Electra1131 jailbreak tool.
* At least 100,000 unique devices have been jailbroken with Electra thus far. If you haven’t already jailbroken your own handset with Electra1131, and would like to, then be sure to check out our in-depth tutorial.
