* As measured by the App Store on January 25, 2016, and published on Apple’s App Store dashboard for developers, iOS 9 is now powering 76 percent of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices, a one-percentage point gain versus the 75 percent mark that was recorded two weeks ago.
* At the same time, the adoption rate for iOS 8 has dropped from nineteen percent as of January 13, 2016, to seventeen percent, a two-point loss.
* Older versions of iOS, which Apple marks as “Earlier” on its pie chart, continue to account for seven percent of devices out there.
* In a rare move, Apple’s most recent quarterly report came with a supplemental material which, for the first time, has revealed the size of its active installed base: a cool one billion of iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod touch, Apple TV and Apple Watch devices.
* In Apple talk, only devices that have been engaged with various Apple services, such as App Stores and iTunes, within the past 90 days count as active devices.
