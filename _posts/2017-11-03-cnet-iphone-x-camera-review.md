* Senior CNET photographer James Martin has decided to test the iPhone X camera by documenting the most devastating wildfire in California’s history.
* James lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, where smoke and ash blanketed the region as wildfires rampaged through Sonoma and Napa counties just 50 miles north of the city.
* He used his iPhone X to document the devastation and clean-up operations.
* “Now that the fires have been extinguished, I wanted to document what needs to be done before Napa and Sonoma counties—some of the most beautiful spots in Northern California—can emerge from such unimaginable devastation.
* After the first half hour of shooting, James realized he wouldn’t need the DSLR camera he always has with him. “iPhone X did what I needed it to do,” he said.

* Taking several hundred photos in a single day, he only applied basic edits for contrast, color and saturation, either right on his phone or in Adobe’s desktop Lightroom app.
* “After I got home and scanned through the photos, I was shocked by the power and beauty of the images I’d captured with a phone,” he wrote. “The fire was more devastating than I had ever imagined. These images will make sure I never forget.”
