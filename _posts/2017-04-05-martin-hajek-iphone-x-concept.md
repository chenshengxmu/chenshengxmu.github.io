* Dutch 3D artist Martin Hajek is behind some of the best conceptual renderings that we’ve featured here on iDownloadBlog. Recently, he teamed up with German magazine Computer Bild to do a batch of renderings for them imagining Apple’s upcoming iPhone X aka iPhone 8 aka iPhone Edition.
* The images hit all the right notes, from a curved AMOLED display with no visible side bezels to an almost full-screen face with no visible chin at the bottom and a thin black strip at the top where the earpiece, sensors and the FaceTime camera are located.
* His design, as you can see, is largely based on iPhone 8 rumor-mill reporting.
* The renderings depict how Apple could supplant the Tenth Anniversary iPhone’s physical Home button with its software counterpart. Not unlike Android’s shortcuts at the bottom of the interface, a software Home button could be realized in the rumored function area alongside the screen bottom.

* Touch ID is integrated right behind the screen.

* That’s unlike Galaxy S8, which moved its fingerprint reader to the back.

* The dual-camera known from iPhone 7 Plus remains, but it no longer sticks out.

* I especially like the way both the stainless steel frame and the black strip running alongside the back’s bottom harken back to the original iPhone.
