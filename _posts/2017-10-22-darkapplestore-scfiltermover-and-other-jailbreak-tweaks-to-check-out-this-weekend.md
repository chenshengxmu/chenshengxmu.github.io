* Jailbreak developers continue to release new jailbreak tweaks in Cydia, and the new Saïgon jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1 is helping to push a few things forward.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the tweaks that launched within the last week. As usual, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites, and we’ll cap off by outlining the rest afterward.

* DarkAppleStore is an aesthetic tweak that tints the translucent tab bar in the Apple Store app darker than it comes out of the box.
* Unlike a lot of tweaks that merely make the UI darker and more opaque, DarkAppleStore maintains the tab bar’s translucency, which means you can still see small details of the app’s contents through it after the darkening.
* To learn more about DarkAppleStore and why you might like it, we’d suggest checking out our full review.

* Snapchat is an enjoyable way to share media with friends, and it includes various methods of customization before sending it along. Among those techniques come by way of Emojis and filters, like the Geofilters shown above.
* You can drag and resize Emojis over anything you capture all you want, but for whatever reason, Snapchat doesn’t let you do the same with filters. SCFilterMover changes that.
* Once installed, you can drag and resize your filters any way you want before sending your media to friends or including it in your Story.
* You can learn more about SCFilterMover in our full review.
* AdaptiveLabels: Changes the text color of an app to match the app’s dominant color (free)
* Citrix Receiver Unblock: Removes jailbreak detection from the Citrix Receiver app (free – review)
* Disabled Big Emoji For WhatsApp: Disables the big Emojis when messaging in WhatsApp (free)
* sleekCompassView: Makes the compass look sleeker by hiding unnecessary UI elements (free – review)
* That pretty much wraps things up for this week’s bout of jailbreak tweak releases, but more are on the way. As usual, we recommend staying tuned to iDB throughout the week to ensure you don’t miss anything you might like.
