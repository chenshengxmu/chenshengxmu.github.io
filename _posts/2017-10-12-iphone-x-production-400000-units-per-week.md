* Poor 3D sensor yield rates are expected to impact iPhone X’s launch supply as Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang pegs current production volume at just 400,000 units per week.
* In an interview with StreetInsider.com, the analyst said that the figure is actually a substantial increase from the previous estimate of 100,00 units per week.
* Despite the increase, Jun maintained his production estimates of 20 million and 50 million iPhone X units for the December and March quarters, respectively. In other words, Apple may be unable to meet demand for iPhone X until 2018 at the earliest.
* He does not see further order push outs for the OLED phone in October.
* Japanese publication Nikkei said today that the sophisticated 3D sensor in Apple’s TrueDepth camera, which enables Face ID and other features, remains the biggest production bottleneck.
* Citing a tech executive familiar with iPhone X production, Nikkei says manufacturers are still struggling to perfect 3D sensors and dot projectors in the TrueDepth camera.
* The person could not pinpoint the exact manufacturing problem.
* In September 2017, analyst Jeff Pu also identified the dot projector, supplied by Lumentum, as the troublesome component holding back mass production of iPhone X. A report this morning stated that Himax has now started shipments of TrueDepth’s wafer-level optics to Apple.
* While this is good news, each and every part that goes into the handset must be manufactured in volume and on time for Apple to meet its self-imposed targets.
* The delay is already hurting companies that have been contracted to assemble the phone. Semiconductor foundry TSMC and contract manufacturer Foxconn, for instance, both reported a drop in revenue in September due to the iPhone X manufacturing delay.
* The anticipated OLED device goes for preorder on October 27 ahead of November 3 launch.
