* Twitterrific, a slick Twitter client from The Iconfactory available for the iPhone, iPad and Mac, has been refreshed in the App Store on Thursday.
* At last, the iPhone and iPad client lets you save unfinished messages so you can work on them later. A major update, Twitterrific 5.1 also includes the ability to view and manage your list of muffled usernames, URLs and hashtags.
* You can now add keywords to the terms that can be filtered or turn any muffled term into a full mute: just swipe left on the item in the list and select the Mute option.
* Doing so will hide the term from your timeline completely. To show it again, you’ll need to un-mute it again. The new muffling and muting features allow users to muffle certain items as well as mute others they may not wish to see at all, developers noted.
* If you ever wanted to save a work-in-progress tweet for later before sending it away, now you can. With draft support, your saved but unsent tweets are available across all your iOS devices, thank to Twitterrific’s excellent iCloud syncing.

* To insert drafts into the compose field, tap the drafts icon to open the list of saved tweets. You can now tap the Copy Drafts icon to both copy a tweet to the clipboard and insert it into the compose field.
* Alternatively, tap the Insert Draft icon to insert a saved tweet directly into the compose field. Selecting Insert moves it from the current list of drafts into compose, effectively deleting it in the process.
* Other changes in this Twitterrific release include an improved sidebar interface, better push notifications, smart quotes, URLs above iOS 8 share sheets, bug fixes and more.
* Twitterrific 5.1 highlights:
* New features
* Improvements
* Bug fixes
* The Twitterrific version history webpage has a complete list of what’s new in this release. The 6.7-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Twitterrific 5 free of charge in the App Store.
* Twitterrific for Mac is available for $4.99 in the Mac App Store.
