* Just picked up your iPhone 4S? Excited? You should be.
* But that excitement may be quickly quelled when you try to activate your new device.
* Apparently, AT&T’s servers are getting hammered, and it’s causing activation to fail over, and over, and over…

* Upon initially setting up your new iPhone 4S, you’re greeted with a message baked in by the carrier stating that “It may take up to 3 minutes to your iPhone”. It looks like AT&T wasn’t prepared for the influx of new activations. Surprise.
* How are things working on Sprint or Verizon? Are you experiencing similar issues, or is it smooth sailing?
