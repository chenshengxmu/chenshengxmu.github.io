* It’s been about 24 hours since the release of RedSn0w 0.9.8b1, a tethered jailbreak for iOS 5 beta 1, and we’ve already had confirmation that it’s possible to add widgets to the Notification Center of Apple’s latest mobile OS. Not only we have the confirmation, but we now have the proof as the jailbreak community has already come up with a tweak for it.
* The tweak is called UISettings, and could be described as a SBSettings widget for the Notification Center.
* Once installed, UISettings will appear in your Notification Center along with the Stocks and Weather widgets, or “tickers”, as Apple likes to call them. Just like SBSettings, it gives you quick access to turn On and Off some important features of your device, such as wifi, Airplane Mode, Bluetooth, etc…
* If you are running a jailbroken version of iOS beta 1 (currently only via RedSn0w for Mac), then you may add the following source and install UISettings from there: http://qwertyoruiop.com/beta.
* This is a pretty exciting news for the jailbreak community which had taken a hit with iOS 5. If anything, this proves that the jailbreak community is more creative than ever and that although iOS 5 replicates many jailbreak tweaks that will probably disappear from Cydia, developer will always come up with new tweaks and improve on what we’ve been given by Apple.
* If you do give UISettings a try, please let us know what you think about it.
