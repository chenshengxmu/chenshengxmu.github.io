* Samsung is about to give the phablet a new meaning with the rumored introduction of the Galaxy Note II at a presser scheduled for August 15. A follow up to the last year’s Galaxy Note with a 5.3-inch display, the Note II is apparently thinner and a bit taller. As a result, the display is also said to have grown in size a tad, now measuring a whopping 5.5 inches diagonally.
* Just how exactly an average human being is supposed to operate this device is anyone’s guess, though clearly there are people out there who prefer mobile devices that fall somewhere in between a large smartphone and a small tablet.
* Apple, of course, is rumored to be addressing the trend of large smartphone displays with the next iPhone, said to be of the same width as existing iPhones, albeit a bit taller, making room for a four-inch display…
* Samsung Electronics America invited select members of the press to a major Galaxy announcement.
* The save-the-date notice reads:
* Please join Samsung Electronics America for a major announcement and unveiling of the newest Galaxy device. An exclusive press conference will take place where full details will be disclosed. An invitation with details will follow soon. Thank you.
* However, 9to5Google editor Seth Weintraub points out that Samsung Electronics America does not handle smartphones in the United States (Samsung Telecommunications America does), leading him to speculate that the presser could be for a Galaxy camera, a tablet or a new TV set.
* The device could sport the Exynos 4412 processor found in the Galaxy S3, though overclocked to 1.6GHz. Screen resolution should remain unchanged at 1280-by-720 pixels and it’s said to run Android Ice Cream Sandwich, but could be upgradeable to Jelly Bean.
* The top image, courtesy of Boy Genius Report, shows just how large the device is one’s hand. I don’t mean to disrespect anyone for their preference for phablets, but take a look at the below snap depicting what operating a 5.3-inch Galaxy Note in real life looks like.

* It’s just a random shot I took last year at the city.
* I would be the first to appreciate a large canvas and Samsung’s vivid AMOLED display technology, but no matter how hard I try I really don’t see myself having public phone calls using such a Gorilla-sized device.
* And just how does this thing fit in your pocket? Not everyone wear work pants.
* More than 43 percent of respondents voted in our poll that going forward a four-inch display should be the new gold standard for iPhones. Less than three percent crave for an iPhone with at least five-inch display.
* How about you?
