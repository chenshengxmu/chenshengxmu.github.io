* Following the inaugural release of the Game of Thrones adventure game series for the iPhone, iPad and Mac back in December, Telltale Games has now released the second installment of the six-episode game.
* Titled The Lost Lords, Episode 2 finds House Forrester in disarray, their liege lord and his heir dead and Ironrath occupied by Whitehill soldiers.
* Needless to say, the survival of the family depends upon those who are left. Game of Thrones Episode 2: The Lost Lords is available in the App Store, Telltale Store and through Steam.
* The game lets you assume the role of any of the five members of House Forrester in various locations around Westeros and Essos and packs in voice talents by Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, among others.
* Episode 2 is set in King’s Landing.
* Mira Forrester must weigh her loyalty to Margaery Tyrell against the needs of her family, while choosing how to play the political games of Tyrion Lannister. One misstep could spell doom for Mira and her entire family.
* To the far north, the blurb explains, Gared Tuttle finds that the wall and its crows hold little love for a squire from the Wolfswood, but finds kinship in the bastard son of Ned Stark. Gared must prove worthy of becoming a ranger in order to carry out the mission given him, one that is vital to the future of those he serves.
* And to the east, the exiled son Asher Forrester is called back to Westeros to aid his family while an unexpected source of hope returns to the Forresters.
* HBO has confirmed that Season 5 kicks off in April. The award-winning fantasy drama television series is adapted from “A Song of Ice and Fire”, George R. R. Martin’s series of epic fantasy novels.
* No update is necessary as Episode 2 is available through a $5 In-App Purchase within the game, with the remaining four chapters set for release in the coming months.
* A one-time $20 Multi-Pack pass gives you access to all the episodes for a fifteen percent lower total price.
* Game of Thrones Episode 2: The Lost Lords is five bucks for the iPhone and iPad in the App Store. The Mac edition will set you back $25 in the Telltale Store, or $30 through Steam for Mac.
