* When it arrives next year, AirPower, Apple’s multi-device wireless charging pad compatible with the ubiquitous Qi standard, may be priced at $199 in the United States.
* As noted by local blog ThinkApple, Polish online retailer X-Kom is advertising AirPower with a price point of 999 Złotych. While the accessory cannot be purchased yet, the price may translate to around $199 in the US (even though 999 Złotych converts to about $270).
* That’s because many items on Apple’s Polish webstore that cost 999 PLN go for around $199 in the US online store. This could be just a placeholder listing so don’t read too much into it.
* AirPower will work with all Qi-certified devices, including the latest iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X smartphones. It also works with Apple Watch Series 3 and the upcoming wireless charging case for AirPods, allowing users to wirelessly charge up to three devices at once.
