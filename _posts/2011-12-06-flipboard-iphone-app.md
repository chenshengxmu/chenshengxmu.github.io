* Flipboard has released its official app for the iPhone. If you don’t know what Flipboard is, it is an interactive magazine for the iPad (now iPhone) that has one of the most beautifully designed interfaces around.
* The iPhone version introduces “Cover Stories,” which is a selection of interesting articles and photos displayed in a gorgeous layout. One thing to note is that the Cover Stories feature is currently iPhone-only and is being brought to the iPad in the near future. 
* What’s New in Version 1.7
* ★ New iPhone edition puts the power of Flipboard in your pocket.
* ★ Cover Stories for iPhone, a selection of interesting articles and photos being shared with you right now. And it gets smarter every time you use it. (Coming soon to iPad.)
* ★ Speed. Flip through pages as you would through a printed magazine, all with the flick of a thumb.
* ★ Flipboard Accounts:
* – Sign into your Flipboard from either iPhone or iPad and get instant access to all your favorite content.
* – Check out All Timelines. Flip through a single feed containing all articles and all photos being shared across all your social networks.
* Flipboard for iPhone also includes a new featured dubbed “Speed” that lets you flip through pages like a printed magazine with a flick of a thumb.
* Flipboard for iPhone is an amazing app and should be tried at least once. You can get Flipboard for your iPhone for free in the App Store.
