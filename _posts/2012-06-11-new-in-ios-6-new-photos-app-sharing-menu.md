* One of the more notable changes we’ve come across in iOS 6 is a new sharing menu screen offered up in the Photos app.
* Not only has Apple switched from text to icons here, but there are a few new choices to pick from as well…
* The ability to share photos and videos via Facebook/Weibo wasn’t present in iOS 5 (for those wondering what Weibo is, it’s essentially a Chinese version of Twitter). And the option to ‘Copy’ media is new as well.
* Once again, nothing groundbreaking here. But surely this enhancement will make life easier for some folks.
