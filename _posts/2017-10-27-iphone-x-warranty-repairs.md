* With iPhone X available to preorder, Apple on Friday announced service pricing for the device, ranging from $279 to replace a broken screen to as much as $549 for any other damage to the device not covered by the standard one-year limited warranty.
* In the United Kingdom, customers will pay £286 for screen repairs and £556 for other out-of-warranty damage. In major European Union markets, the price of iPhone X screen repairs is set to €321 and a whopping €611 for other damage.
* These screen repair prices apply if your iPhone X is not covered by the optional AppleCare+ warranty and the screen stops working or gets broken due to accidental damage or mishandling (accidental and cosmetic damage isn’t covered by the standard Apple warranty).
* With these prices, the $199 AppleCare+ protection for iPhone X suddenly makes sense.
* Extending your coverage for manufacturing defects or battery life issues to two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone X, AppleCare+ includes two incidents of accidental damage coverage (water damage is counted under “accidental damage coverage”).
* You can use an incident for screen repair or for other damage to your iPhone X.

* While this is a big jump from the $149 price Apple charges for AppleCare+ for iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 (due to the iPhone X screen being more expensive), I think AppleCare+ for iPhone X is worth considering given the price of out-of-warranty repairs.
* TIP: Check the warranty status of your devices with the Apple Support app
* Each incident under the AppleCare+ protection plan incurs a service fee. As an example, if you have AppleCare+ coverage you’ll pay only $29 to have your iPhone X screen replaced (other damage is subject to a one-time $99 service fee), and that’s way easier to swallow than shelling out $279 for a new screen without AppleCare+.
* Do you plan on buying AppleCare+ for your iPhone X?
