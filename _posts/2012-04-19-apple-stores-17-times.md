* We’ve always known that Apple’s retail stores see crazy amounts of foot traffic. In fact, all it takes is a quick glance in your local Apple Store to see that. It seems like they are always busy.
* Well today, research firm Asymco published an interesting report regarding the performance of the Mac-maker’s worldwide retail chain. And the results are staggering…
* With the help of RetailSails, a marketing research company, Asymco found that Apple’s brick and mortar stores see 17 times more sales per square foot than the average retail store. While Apple enjoys an average of nearly $6500 in sales PSF, stores like Guess and Urban Outfitters see less than $500 in the same metric.
* Perhaps just as interesting is the fact that Apple Stores bring in more money — double the amount of sales per square foot — than Tiffany & Co, a high-end jewelry store.
* Steve Jobs unveiled Apple’s first store on May 15, 2001 in Tysons Virginia in the face of much criticism. The company now has more than 360 successful stores worldwide.
