* There have been plenty of rumors surrounding iPad 3 specs and launch date. The iPad 3 is rumored to have a Retina display, upgraded cameras, LTE, possibility of Siri, and a quad-core processor. Apple is rumored to announce the iPad 3 on March 7th, and ship it a few days later.
* Tonight, Apple Daily has leaked some pretty interesting pictures of what they say is the iPad 3. They have posted a supposed over-head image of the iPad 3, revealing slightly more tapered edges and redesigned camera…
* Apply Daily has also posted a picture of the first-gen iPad, iPad 2, and supposed iPad 3 side-by-side. You can tell the slight difference between the iPad 3 and iPad 2, specifically around the edges and camera.
* What’s interesting about the leaked photos is there is no Apple markings besides the Apple logo itself. The images do look to match up with already leaked cases, however.
* Apple has also reportedly been pushing select developers to finish their iOS apps, so Apple can demo them on stage during the iPad 3 announcement and in iPad 3 commercials.
* At any rate, the iPad 3 announcement doesn’t appear to be that far off.
* What do you think of tonight’s leaked images?
