* iPhone 8 will allegedly have an elongated Power button that could double as a Siri shortcut, based on a discovery in the iOS 11 source code by iOS developer Guilherme Rambo.
* “I did find a gesture to invoke Siri by holding the Power button,” the developer tweeted Saturday.
* This possible new gesture should be in addition to the standard “Hey Siri” function that allows you to invoke the personal assistant hands-free.
* If the rumor turns out to be true, iPhone 8 will have a multi-functional Power button. Press it once to lock or wake up your phone. Hold it longer to invoke your personal assistant or press it quickly five times to bring up the Emergency SOS screen where you can power the handset down or even temporarily disable Touch ID and require a passcode.

* Brazilian outlet iHelp last month discovered code strings in the HomePod firmware suggesting that the Power button could also change functions depending on the app currently in use. The button could have two separate contact switches to support the rumored shortcuts.
* According to Bloomberg, iPhone 8 will ditch the physical Home button in favor of an iPad-like Dock that’ll reportedly let you quickly switch apps and enter the revamped app switcher.
