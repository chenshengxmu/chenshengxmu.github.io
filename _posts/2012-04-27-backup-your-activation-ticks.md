* We’ve shown you how to manually backup your iPhone’s unlock activation ticket. And then a new version of Red Sn0w came out that made the process even easier. Well now, thanks to a new jailbreak utility, you can do it right from your iPhone.
* Folks using the new SAM method to unlock their handsets have been directed to backup their activation tickets to make unlocking a possibility in the future. And now with Cookie, the task is as easy as opening an app and tapping a button…
* The developer explains:
* “Cookie can Backup your iPhone Activation Tickets to Cloud, and once you back it up, you can Restore it to your iPhone ANY TIME! Ticket data is stored on weiphone servers. Use this if you have Activation Tickets gotten by SAM trick, do it before it’s too late.”
* That’s right, you can even restore your activation ticket right from your iPhone. I haven’t had a need to restore just yet, but I can confirm that the backup feature works as advertised. If you’re using the new SAM unlock method, this is a must have.
* You can download Cookie from the BigBoss repo, in Cydia, for free.
* What do you think of Cookie?
