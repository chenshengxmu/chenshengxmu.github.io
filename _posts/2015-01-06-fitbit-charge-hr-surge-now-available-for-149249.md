* Can’t wait for the Apple Watch to track your health? Fitbit announced the availability of the Charge HR and Surge on Tuesday, after unveiling the products last October.
* The Charge HR, available from Fitbit’s website for $149, is a heart rate tracker on the wrist, with an OLED screen, an exercise mode, Caller ID, automatic sleep detection, and a water resistant design with 5 days of battery life. It’s available in plum, black, blue, or tangerine.
* Furthermore, the Surge is available on Fitbit’s website for $249, and features a full-fledged smartwatch-like screen. The Surge has built-in GPS to measure distance without the need to tether to a smartphone or a tablet. Taking data from as many as eight sensors — a tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, ambient light sensor, GPS and heart rate — the Surge enables continuous heart rate and all-day activity tracking and sleep monitoring.
* Fitbit revealed the Charge (available since October for $129), Charge HR, and Surge, after its Force fitness band was causing a skin irritation in some users.
* On Tuesday, Fitbit also announced users will now be able to have up to 5 Fitbit devices to sync to one account and exercise summaries that can be displayed directly on the Charge HR display.
