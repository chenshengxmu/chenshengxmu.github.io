* Well, that’s all folks. Apple’s highly anticipated iPad mini event has come, and gone. All announcements have been made, all new products have been unveiled, and now the day is coming to a close.
* A lot has happened in the past 14 hours, with new tablets, computers and software all making an appearance during today’s event. And we understand that it might have been difficult to keep track of it all.
* That’s why we’ve put together this awesome roundup of everything important that happened today. Here’s everything you need to know about the iPad mini event…
* The day started off with the revelation that for the first time in more than 5 years, Apple would be live streaming its media event to the public. And it was actually pretty nice, as we were able to watch everything in real time.
* Now, onto the event. As usual, Tim Cook got things started by rattling off a bunch of Apple’s recent achievements and milestones like, as of two weeks ago it had sold over 200 million iPads. More on that here.
* Cook then went on to show off new versions of iBooks and iBooks Author. Both apps were updated today with new features and improvements. If you’re an author, or an iBooks user, you’ll want to check this out:
* Next, SVP Phil Schiller took the stage to introduce the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, and updated iMacs and Mac minis. The new iMac, by the way, looks awesome. Here’s all of our new Mac coverage:
* Then it was onto iPads. First up, Apple unveiled the new fourth generation iPad. It’s essentially the same as its predecessor, but with a faster processor and other improvements. Here’s all of today’s iPad 4 news:
* Finally, it was time for the main event. As expected, Apple took the wraps off the long-rumored iPad mini. It has a 7.9-inch display, it’s 7.2mm thin, and starts at $329. You can find all of your iPad mini news here:
* And for good measure, here’s a head to head spec shootout between all of Apple’s tablets, a link to the video stream of today’s iPad mini event and everything else that we couldn’t find a place for in the above categories:
* Whew! That should just about do it. Obviously there will be more iPad and iPad mini-related news over the next days and weeks. But from all of us here at iDB, thank you so much for hanging out with us today.
