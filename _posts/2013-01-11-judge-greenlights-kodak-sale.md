* Last year, Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and came up with a plan to sell off its collection of imaging patents to pay off its debts. It wanted more than $2 billion for the IP, but ended up settling on a $525 million offer from a consortium of companies led by Apple and Google. And today, Bankruptcy Court Judge Allan Gropper has green-lighted the deal…
* Reuters reports:
* “Eastman Kodak Co’s proposed $525 million sale of its digital imaging patents to Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corp got a bankruptcy judge’s approval on Friday, bringing the photography innovator a step closer to exiting Chapter 11…
* …Judge Allan Gropper gave his green light at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. “We’re disappointed in the price, but we’re moving the case forward,” Gropper said.”
* The consortium, spear-headed by Intellectual Ventures and RPX, included 12 tech giants: Apple, Research In Motion, Google, Samsung Electronics, Adobe Systems, HTC, Facebook, Fujifilm, Huawei, Amazon, Shutterfly and Microsoft. Each company will get licenses to the lot of 1,100+ patents that cover everything from mobile, to digital imaging inventions.
* Despite the lower price, Kodak says that it’s happy with the deal and the court’s approval. It allows the company to proceed with a plan to secure $830 million in financing and exit bankruptcy in the first half of this year. “The monetization of non-core IP assets achieves one of Kodak’s key restructuring objectives while positioning its commercial imaging business for further growth and success,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.
* So it looks like, for now anyway, the Kodak story isn’t over yet. And Apple, Samsung and several other tech companies just acquired significant patents that — for once — they can’t use to sue each other with, because they’re all license holders. I would say that this has turned out well for everyone involved.
