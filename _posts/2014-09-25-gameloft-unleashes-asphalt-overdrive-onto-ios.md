* French games maker Gameloft released a new racing game, Asphalt Overdrive, onto the App Store Thursday. Available for the iPhone and iPad on a free-to-play basis, the retro-styled racing title files as the first spinoff in the award-winning Asphalt franchise.
* Set in a “new ’80s” version of California, the game features an intense racing experience which challenges players to outsmart and outrun the cops.
* Download Asphalt Overdrive free from the App Store.
* The mission-based lane racer includes 30 fully licensed vehicles, such as the iconic Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari Testarossa, that can be improved and upgraded as you progress throughout the game.
* There are seven different mission types to choose from, including escaping the cops, defeating bosses, avoiding obstacles, performing impressive stunts and more.
* Here’s the high-octane promotional trailer.
* If you have one of the recent Lightning devices with either the A7 or A8 chip, you’ll no doubt appreciate lush visuals, real-time lighting and particle effects and more.

* Featuring Facebook and Game Center integration, Asphalt Overdrive lets you play with or against other players online, form a team with the goal of participating in weekly challenges, compete in Gang and League events and so forth.
* Key highlights include:
* Speaking of racing games, Gameoft’s previous Asphalt game, Asphalt 8: Airborne, got updated with iOS 8 Metal graphics a few days ago. And while we’re at it, you may also want to check out Asphalt 7: Heat, which received four out of five stars from tens of thousands of reviewers.
* The 93.8-megabyte universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.0 or later. It’s also optimized for the bigger screens on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
