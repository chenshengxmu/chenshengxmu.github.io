* Are you still trying to decide which over the top (OTT) video streaming service is for you? DirecTV Now just gave you a few more reasons to take it for a test drive. 
* After months of testing, DirecTV Now is now offering its True Cloud DVR service to everyone who subscribes. With the Cloud DVR, you can record your favorite programs and watch them anytime you want for up to 30 days across multiple devices, including iOS, Apple TV.
* For now, True Cloud DVR comes with 20 hours of free recording. You can increase this number to up to 100 hours per month by paying extra.
* Also today, May 15, DirecTV Now has a new look and feel on select platforms, including iOS, tvOS, and support web browsers. The new UI launches on Android, Fire TV, and Roku over the coming weeks.
* Other new features include:
* Expanded On Demand Content. Depending on your subscription choices, get access to more than 25,000 titles on DIRECTV NOW. Not enough for you? We’ve added more capacity so you can watch even more on-demand entertainment to your heart’s desire. New episodes on select channels will be available on-demand after airing, so you don’t have to worry about setting up a recording prior.
* Up to Three Streams at Once. Enjoy access to up to three simultaneous different streams per account. Don’t want to watch cartoons with the kids? Sick of your spouse’s love for reality TV? Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered beyond the standard two streams with a third stream for $5 per month.
* Local Channels on the Road. Before, you only were able to access the local networks via DIRECTV NOW at home. Now, if you want to catch local news while you travel, you’ll be able to. For example, if you watch FOX (KTTV) on DIRECTV NOW at home in Los Angeles and are traveling to Dallas, where FOX (KDFW) station is available for DIRECTV NOW customers, you’ll be able to watch KDFW during your visit.
* DirecTV Now launched in 2016 and offers OTT video streaming starting at $35 per month. For a limited time, you can get a free Apple TV 4K when you prepay for three months of DirecTV Now service. This deal is only available to new DirecTV subscribers.
