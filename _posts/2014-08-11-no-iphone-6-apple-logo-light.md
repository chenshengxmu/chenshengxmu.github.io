* Several photographs of claimed iPhone 6 parts have led Apple bloggers to frantically speculate that a logo cutout on the rear would allow for a MacBook-style illumination serving as a notification light of sorts for missed calls, important messages and what not.
* We even ran a poll asking whether the iPhone 6 should include a lit Apple logo on the rear and more than three out of each four respondents voted ‘yes’.
* Time for a reality check. If numerous photographs of supposed iPhone 6 parts that have leaked recently are anything to go by, this doesn’t seem to be the case after all…
* First up is the above image showing a handful of Apple logos destined to be fitted on the back panel of the iPhone 6.
* Originally published by Taiwanese blog AppleClub [Google translate] and featured by GforGames, there don’t seem to be any LED or connectors visible on the shot that could suggest that the light would shine through the logo cutout.
* In addition, the source of this photo has reportedly confirmed that the rear shell won’t emit any kind of light through the logo opening.
* Next, we have a bunch of claimed iPhone 6 component photos, including the embedded rear Apple logo, flex cables, Touch ID home button and external camera ring, all reposted by French blog NowhereElse.fr [Google translate].

* And here’s a claimed Lightning port part.

* This seems to be the Touch ID home button enclosure.

* The following photo apparently shows an external camera ring that supports the thesis that the back iSight camera on the iPhone 6 will feature a protruding lens – similar to the iPod touch’s camera – rather than being flush with the housing.

* Last week, luxury accessory vendor Feld & Volk on its Instagram profile shared photos of the embedded rear Apple logo and other claimed parts, included below.

* The part (via MacRumors) is in an intermediate stage of production so it lacks Apple’s fit and finish.
* The logo seems to be made of “very extraordinary” scratch-resistant metal and Feld & Volk speculates it could be a Liquidmetal alloy.
* Conveniently, Apple in May renewed its exclusive Liquidmetal deal for consumer products. For reference, only the original iPhone has thus far featured the embedded Apple logo (iPads have them, too).
* Pictured below: a purported iPhone 6 back camera with protruding lens.

* And last but not least, Feld & Volk shared a closeup of the volume button cutouts.

* Notice how the cutouts have now been recessed slightly, presumably in order to prevent accidental volume changes while allowing for a lower profile along the edges.
* What do you guys make of all this?
