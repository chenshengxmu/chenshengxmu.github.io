* Apple today posted a new photography-focused iPhone X ad on its official YouTube channel.
* Titled “Studio in your pocket” and running 30 seconds long, the spot highlights the DepthCamera-based Portrait Lighting features that are exclusive to your iPhone X. For those wondering, the video embedded below is set to the song “La Fête Noire” by Flavien Berger.
* Good job, this is yet another expertly done ad by Team Cupertino!
