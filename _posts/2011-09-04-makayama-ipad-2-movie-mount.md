* We all love the iPhone 4’s camera. The iPhone’s success as a camera and HD video recorder has been widely observed, with the smartphone topping the chart of used cameras on Flickr.
* The problem is that neither the iPad 2’s front or rear-facing camera is very good. Yes, they both work for snapping a simple shot here and there, and the front-facing camera does a reasonable job for FaceTime, but that’s about it. The iPad’s shear size doesn’t help its usefulness as a camera, either.
* The iDevice accessory and app makers at Makayama have come up with an iPad 2 movie mount that, they claim, will improve the iPad’s shot-taking prowess…
* The Movie Mount is a piece of hardware which acts as a base for a host of add-on accessories, with a tripod, a selection of lenses, and an optical viewfinder amongst them. When everything’s attached, you could almost argue that the iPad 2 becomes a near-semi-pro setup.
* “The Movie Mount is a unique piece of hardware which allows you to radically improve video capture with the iPad2. It turns your iPad into a complete studio. Use tele- and wide angle lenses, attach microphones and lights. Use a tripod for super stable shots and much more. Comes with a free app.”
* While this all sounds great, it’s worth remembering that even with all the fancy gizmos added, you’re still shooting with an iPad 2. And those cameras aren’t going to get any better, unfortunately.
* If you’re still intrgued by what Makayama has to offer, then pre-order your very own Movie Mount now!
* “Only $ 69.95 / EUR 49.95 EUR, including taxes and shipping worldwide. First deliveries will begin october 2011.”
* If you do pick one up, be sure to report back in the comments!
