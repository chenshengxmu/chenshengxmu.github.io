* We just shared the news that the GreenPois0n jailbreak will only work for the iPhone 4, iPad, and iPod Touch 4G. However a random tipster just pointed me to this tweet from MuscleNerd saying that even though GreenPois0n won’t work for the iPhone 3GS, Comex is working on developing a new jailbreak for this device.
* That’s indeed some good news for those of you who have an iPhone 3GS. At this point it is still unclear whether this new jailbreak by Comex will work with the iPhone 3G as well. There is absolutely no ETA for this jailbreak. I guess time will tell…
* Update: MuscleNerd told me on Twitter that to jailbreak the iPhone 3G you will have to use RedSn0w or PwnageTool.
