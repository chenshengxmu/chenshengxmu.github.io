* It’s been a little over a week since we got our hands on Apple’s new iPhone hardware, and we have some deeper thoughts on the device now that we’ve had some serious hands on time with it. We also discuss the matter of simplifying our device cluttered lives, bugs in iOS 7, and our expectations for Touch ID implementation in future Apple products. Jailbreaking is also a hot topic as we discuss the iOS 6.1.3/6.1.4 jailbreak, the iOS 7 jailbreak, and a couple of new jailbreak tweaks that are making waves in the jailbreak community.
