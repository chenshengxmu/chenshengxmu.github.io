* As you know, Apple is scheduled to begin taking iPhone X preorders tomorrow, October 27 from 12:01am PDT via its website and through the battle-tested Apple Store app.
* We’ve set out to create a quick poll to gauge our audience in terms of their preferred iPhone X preorder. Apple is offering the phone in just two finishes—Silver and Space Gray. This time around, Silver comes with an all-black faceplate which makes it a great option for those who can’t stand white bezels when watching movies, playing games and more.
* Each colorway is available in two storage capacities: 64GB and 256GB. And of course, all iPhone X models include the notch as standard feature.

* Apple confirmed via a press release a few days ago that its retail outlets will have iPhone X available for walk-in customers at launch.
* Nevertheless, the company is still cautioning would-be buyers to “arrive early.”
* Here’s a list of iPhone X launch countries:
* To avoid standing in the line (that’s so last decade), you’re advised to pre-order your OLED iPhone as soon as it goes live tonight at apple.com.
