title: 'Chip' now available on Cydia
---
* A few days ago, we gave you an exclusive preview of Chip, a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to customize banner notifications background color, text color, border color, and gradient using simple RGB sliders. Chip also includes the ability to customize the notification sound and banner animation. In short, it brings an insane level of customization to your notifications.
* Chip is now available in Cydia, via the BigBoss repo for $1.99.
