* If you’ve jailbroken or unlocked your iPhone, iPod, or iPad before you’re probably used to the usual procedure. You usually have to download the iOS IPSW firmware file in order to continue with the jailbreaking of your iDevice.
* ipswDownloader by developer Vitaly Parovishnik makes this process a whole lot easier. The program not only downloads the IPSW firmware file for you, but also displays whether the firmware you’ve selected can be jailbroken and unlocked, along with the size of the IPSW and the tools needed to jailbreak the firmware. 
* This is a must-have application for all of our readers that are new to the jailbreak/unlock scene, and also for those of you that consider yourself iPhone experts. For upgrading to the newest jailbreak, this is definitely a nice utility to have at your fingertips.
* Sadly, ipswDownloader is only available for Mac OS X. You can download the app for free here.
