* Only moments ago we told you that i0n1c released his untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.2. The download that i0n1c posted consisted of the jailbreak code, instead of an actual tool for end users.
* Right after i0n1c’s release, the Dev Team has updated the RedSn0w jailbreak tool with iOS 4.3.2 support. RedSn0w will successfully jailbreak iOS 4.3.2 and is available on both Mac OS X and Windows.
* From the Dev Team’s blog,
* “Only a few weeks after the 4.3.1 untether created by @i0n1c was released, Apple pushed out firmware 4.3.2. Thankfully, it appears Apple didn’t have a chance to fix the hole used by @i0n1c’s untether, so he ported his code over to 4.3.2’s kernel.
* As always, ultrasn0w unlockers should stay away from redsn0w and only update their firmware through a custom IPSW. We’ll release a new version of PwnageTool sometime this week.
* Note that many people are currently having problems updating to 4.3.2 through saurik’s server. You’ll need to remove the gs.apple.com entry in your hosts file in order to restore directly to Apple’s servers.”

* RedSn0w has already offered a tethered jailbreak for iOS 4.3.2, but this new update allows for a more stable untethered solution.
