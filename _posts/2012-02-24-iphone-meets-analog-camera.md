* Have you been looking for a quirky photography accessory for your iPhone? Perhaps a case that looks like an old-school analog camera and has interchangeable lenses?
* Well if you answered yes to either of the above questions, then you’re going to want to check out Photojojo’s new Rangefinder. The accessory gives your iPhone the look and feel of a retro-style camera, while utilizing its cutting-edge picture-taking technology…
* “The iPhone Rangefinder is a phoneography system that gives your iPhone all the style of a classic camera. It’ll equip your iPhone all the style of a classic camera. It’ll equip your phone with a shutter button, viewfinder, aperture numbers, two loops for a camera strap, and a tripod mount!”
* The Rangefinder features a working shutter button, viewfinder, and is compatible with all of your Magnetic Cell Lenses. The front lens is [obviously] fake, but it contains a built-in mirror that could come in handy when taking self-portraits. Cool.

* The Case itself is $65. If you want to add a pack of Magnetic Lenses (Fisheye, Telephoto and Wide/Macro), you’ll have to fork over $100 for the bundle. Both packages are available now in Photojojo’s online store.
* What do you think of the iPhone Rangefinder? Will you be buying one?
