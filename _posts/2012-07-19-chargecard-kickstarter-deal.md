* This is pretty cool: inventors Noah Dentzel and Adam Miller have finally come up with a solution to the problem of having to lug around a spare iPhone cable.
* The ChargeCard works just like your average 30-pin USB cable — it will charge your device and transfer data — but it’s compact enough to fit in your wallet…
* The accessory is 0.1″ thick (or 2.54mm), meaning it should fit in the slimmest of wallets, and it’s made of ultra-durable ABS plastic. It also comes in a handful of different colors.
* As you’ve probably figured out by now, ChargeCard isn’t available for purchase yet. Its creators are currently trying to raise funding through a Kickstarter project, so they can start mass production.
* At the time of this writing, the project has collected just over $16,000 of its $50,000 goal. If you want to help them hit that mark, pledges of $18 or more will also score you a ChargeCard pre-order, your choice of color.
* This is a classic example of how ideas can turn into real products, thanks to the help of Kickstarter. We really like the ChargeCard. We just wish Apple wasn’t changing up the iPhone’s charging port this fall.
* What do you think of the ChargeCard?
