* If you need an all-in-one cloud manager solution to manage your files scattered across multiple cloud-storage services, including iCloud Drive, Dropbox or Google Drive, check out an app called AnyTrans for Cloud by iMobie.
* Available for Mac and Windows PCs, and on the web at cloud.imobie.com, AnyTrans for Cloud is the world’s first cloud manager that lets you access iCloud Drive, as well as sync and manage files across multiple services, all in one spot.
* As soon as you sign up with Google, Facebook or Twitter, you can start using the app.
* Your cloud contents are 100% safe and secure because the app adopts Apple’s and Google’s secure Two-Factor Authentication systems, as well as SSL-256 encryption technologies.
* Thanks to encryption, no one can eavesdrop on your transfers.

* Prevent unwanted access with multiple advanced security settings.
* Similar to Apple’s Files app, AnyTrans lets you manage various third-party cloud services in one place, like OneDrive and Dropbox. There’s no need to switch apps back and forth, you can access and manage all your cloud drives with a single login. And thanks to the web app, your cloud files are accessible via any machine with a web browser.
* You can upload multiple files and folders from your computer to your favorite cloud storage in bulk, or download them to your device. Thanks to an advanced transfer engine that uses concurrent transfers, AnyTrans takes full advantage of your available network bandwidth.

* It’s easy to share online files, while keeping your personal data safe
* You can even share your cloud files and/or folders super quickly through a link. Instead of sending someone tens of megabytes of files, you simply send a link via email, Facebook or by other means. Anyone with a link can download a ZIP archive of your files to their device.
* When sharing cloud files via a link, you can adjust additional parameters like the type or the expiration time of the sharing link to prevent unwanted access after the cut-off time.
* You can tell AnyTrans to sync files automatically to a target cloud service.
* This lets you do things like keep your photos, videos and other large files in perfect sync between two cloud storage services, based on a custom schedule. This lets you keep projects synchronized between, say, your primary cloud storage and one you use for backup.
* It’s great that cloud-to-cloud transfers can be initiated without the need for a constant Internet connection because the AnyTrans engine in the cloud talks to services directly.

* You can access AnyTrans for Cloud through a web browser from any device
* If you’re on a metered Internet connection, you’ll appreciate the ability to migrate files between cloud services without bandwidth limitations. Neither Apple’s Files app nor any other major cloud storage solution supports this capability.
* AnyTrans comes with three customized cloud-to-cloud sync channels:
* The advantage of the Premium channel is that it is faster than the Offline and Online channels when transferring files from one cloud drive to another. With Premium channel, you can also set schedules to automatically transfer or sync photos, videos, files, folders, etc, from one cloud service to another, at the time of your choosing.
* The company that made this cool little app is also behind AnyTrans iPhone Manager that gives you full control over iOS device backups, transfers and content on your iOS device (the app recently passed 10 million users).
* Add cloud services to manage your files in one central place

* You should also check out AnyTrans for iOS and Android. This mobile app allows for greater flexibility when it comes to managing content on your phone by letting you easily transfer your photos and other content to a computer, change ringtones, back up the phone and more.
