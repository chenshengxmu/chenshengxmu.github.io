* Car chargers can be hit-or-miss when it comes to how fast you can get juiced up before your drive is over. Ideally, a high powered charger will get you up to speed, at least as fast as your stock iPhone 6s wall charger would.
* Scosche’s reVOLT is a dual port car charger that connects to your vehicle’s power accessory outlet (otherwise known as the cigarette lighter). It packs 12 watts of power for 2.4 amps per port, so you can charge your most power hungry devices fast.
* The plug is low-profile and sticks out from your car’s accessory outlet less than an inch. It has two USB outlets, and has an internal blue LED light that glows when plugged in to help you see the ports better in the dark.
* Because the charger puts out 12 watts at 2.4 amps per port, it works fast to juice up your devices. The company claims it will fully charge two current-model iPad Air tablets simultaneously with no performance loss.
* The charging circuitry is designed specifically for iOS devices, so take into consideration the possibility that non-Apple products may not work. Although the company claims that it supports “most smartphones,” multiple users have noted that it does not charge certain Samsung handsets without a charge-only cable.
* Scosche’s reVOLT dual port 12-watt car charger is highly rated with 4.5 stars across more than 1,000 reviews. It is available on Amazon for $14.
