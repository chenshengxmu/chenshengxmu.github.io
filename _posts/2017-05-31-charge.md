* Any time you plug your locked iOS device into a power source, a full-screen charging view with a large battery icon and the percentage you have remaining appears. It’s a simple UI, but one jailbreak developer thought they could do better.
* A new jailbreak tweak dubbed Charge by iOS developer Mr Smith, supercharges your Lock screen’s charging view with a bevy of aesthetically-pleasing features. Not only does it provide a dreamy interface for minimalists, but it offers more information at a glance than the stock interface does.
* Charge is significantly more effective at communicating information about your battery and device. It appears every time you wake your device up while it’s connected to a power source, rather than only the moment your device gets plugged in.
* Shown above, the interface is to the point; dot-style indicators illustrate how much battery level is remaining, while additional information like the date, the time, and a text readout of the exact battery percentage complement the battery indicator.
* Almost every aesthetic of Charge is customizable, and that will be apparent once you visit the tweak’s preferences pane via the Settings app:

* To give you an idea of what the fade effect looks like, here’s an example of it as we unlock the device:

* The Colorization pane is the final one you’ll find in Charge’s settings and lets you give the interface a unique splash of color to match any wallpapers or themes you’re using. Among the things you can colorize here are:
* Right out of the box, the stock settings of Charge are visually charming. The tweak is an improvement over the stock interface both functionally and aesthetically, as it provides much more information at a glance in a subtle way.
* With a persistent battery display that doesn’t go away until you unplug your device, you can easily keep track of your battery percentage without squinting at the Status Bar. Best of all, the colorization and animation options look great as you use your device.
* Since battery information is a huge topic of discussion for mobile device users, an interface that more effectively communicates battery charge level is a must-have. If you’re infested in giving it a try, you can download it on your jailbroken iOS 10 device from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $0.99.
