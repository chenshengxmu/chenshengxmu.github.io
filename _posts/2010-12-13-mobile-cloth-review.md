* The folks from Mobile Cloth contacted me last week saying they wanted to send their product for review. As usual, I replied telling them they could send me their product for review but there was absolutely no guarantee that I’d talk about it on iDB.
* Besides, I wasn’t really excited with the product they wanted to send me: a cleaning cloth. That was until I actually received the Mobile Cloth and tried it on with all my devices, the results were pretty astonishing…
* MOBiLE CLOTH is made of a unique high tech material consisting of microfibers 100 times thinner than a human hair! It is woven into a special pattern which we call “nubs”. Each nub acts like hundreds of tiny suction cups to pull fingerprints smudges, and all kinds of other junk away from the surface of your device and into the cloth with one or two swipes. No water or cleaning solution is needed.
* I first decided to try it on my iPad, which I usually clean with a t-shirt. In less than 10 seconds, the screen of the iPad was as clean as it was when it first came out of the box. Same with my iPhone. It took me a couple seconds to get the screen perfectly cleaned up from any fingerprints. Finally, I tried the Mobile Cloth on my MacBook Pro, and again, in just seconds, the screen was cleaner than it ever was.
* Not only the Mobile Cloth removes fingerprints and smudges in no time, but it also kills up to 98% of germs, without the need of any chemical.
* The Mobile Cloth won’t break your budget either. Starting at $2.99 for a one-pack, it goes all the way up to $11.99 for a six-pack.
* At this price, the Mobile Cloth should be a no brainer. It is inexpensive and most importantly, it does an amazing job at cleaning your iPhone, iPad, and computer screen.
* You can get the Mobile Cloth from here.
