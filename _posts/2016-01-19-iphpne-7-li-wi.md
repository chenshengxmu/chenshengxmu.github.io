* You can now put a new kind of ultra-fast wireless networking technology on your list of potential hardware advances that might be in tow for Apple’s ‘iPhone 7’ refresh later this year.
* As first spotted by Twitter user Chase Fromm, code strings in iOS indicate that Apple could be experimenting with an ultra-fast, light-based wireless data technology, dubbed Li-Fi.
* In modulating visible light in a manner that is imperceptible to the human eye, Li-Fi promises a theoretical throughput capacity of up to 224 gigabits per second versus up to just a few gigabits per second for the current-generation 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard.
* References to the experimental wireless Li-Fi networking protocol have started to appear in recent builds of iOS beginning with iOS 9.1. It’s interesting that Apple’s patent application, filed back in 2013, outlines a method for “optical modulation using an image sensor” which could capture both images and transmit data.

* According to International Business Times, Estonian startup Velmenni has already begun real-world testing of Li-Fi technology within offices and industrial environments in Tallinn. Their current implementation of Li-Fi can transmit data at up to 1 gigabit per second, allowing a high-definition film to be downloaded in just a few seconds.
* Researchers have achieved speeds of 224 gigabits per second in lab conditions.
* And here’s a TED Talks video with professor Harald Haas from the University of Edinburgh, who invented this technology, in which he demonstrates a device capable of flickering the light from a single LED, a change too quick for the human eye to detect, to transmit far more data than a cellular tower.
* Haas said that in the future, every LED lightbulb could be used as an ultra-fast alternative to Wi-Fi, acting as a wireless access point.
* “All we need to do is fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device and this would then combine two basic functionalities: illumination and wireless data transmission,” Haas said.
* “In the future we will not only have 14 billion light bulbs, we may have 14 billion Li-Fis deployed worldwide for a cleaner, greener and even brighter future.”
* In addition to fast data transfer, Li-Fi benefits from less interference between devices. Commercial Li-Fi deployment may become a reality within the next three to four years, potentially allowing people to access the internet using smart light bulbs in their home.
* That being said, there really is no no guarantee that Apple will outfit the next iPhone with Li-Fi or embrace the technology before it’s ready for prime time.
