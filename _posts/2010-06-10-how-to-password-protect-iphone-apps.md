---

* If you have an iPhone and your kids are used to play with it, installing LockDown on a few of your apps might be helpful to prevent them from accidentally delete some of your stuff.
* LockDown gives another layer of protection to your sensitive data, even though we saw that anyone willing to can easily steal your iPhone data.
* You can download LockDown from Cydia for free. One advice though, don’t do the mistake I just did… Don’t install this on your iPad (at least not as of today) because it is not compatible and will get you into trouble…
