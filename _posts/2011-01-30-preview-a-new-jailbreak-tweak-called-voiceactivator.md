* The iPhone has had “Voice Control” for quite awhile. And although many verbal commands are supported, the iPhone’s Voice Control still lacks the potential it could have.
* You can already use Voice Control to make a call and play a song, but it’s a shame you can’t have more varied types of commands. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use the iPhone’s native verbal recognition to look up a webpage or launch an app?
* A new jailbreak tweak, by popular developer chpwn, will soon be released in Cydia. Its aim is to provide more customizability and functionality to the iPhone’s Voice Control…
* VoiceActivator will have its own Settings panel where you’ll be able to edit voice commands like you would keyboard shortcuts on the desktop. For instance, let’s say that you want to open our site’s web app on your iPhone; assign “iDB” or “iPhoneDownloadBlog” as a command in VoiceActivator, say the command into Voice Control, and our web app will open in Safari. Pretty cool, huh?
* VoiceActivator can open apps via voice commands as well. The demo video also demonstrates how VoiceActivator can set a voice command for taking a screenshot.
* While I am not personally a fan of Voice Control on the iPhone, this new tweak may resurrect my interest in its capabilities. Who knows what cool stuff people will think of using VoiceActivator for.
* We’ll keep you updated when VoiceActivator goes live in Cydia. We can’t wait to try it.
* What do you think about this new tweak? Sound useful? Do you use voice commands on the iPhone already?
