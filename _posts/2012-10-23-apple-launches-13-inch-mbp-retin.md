* As expected, Apple here at San Jose’s California Theatre shared some news regarding Mac notebooks. AS MacBooks continue to outgrow the PC industry sixth year in a row, they remain both the leading desktop and notebook in the United States. Not one to be standing still, the company just took the wraps off a 13-inch MacBook Pro with a whopping 2,600-by-1,600 pixel resolution, or four times the number of pixels…
* The 13-inch MacBook Pro is Apple’s best-selling notebook, Phil Schiller said before announcing something “so much better and cooler”.
* The refreshed 13-incher weighs in at 3.75 pounds, almost a pound lighter. In fact, it’s Apple’s lightest MacBook Pro ever. It’s also  0.75 inch thin, or one-fifth thinner than before.

* The display itself features rich color with deeper blacks, a 29 percent higher contrast ratio, 300 nits brigthness and 75 percent reduced reflection. It also has IPS technology for 178-degree viewing angle.

* Apple kept the previous-generation 13-incher alongside the new, a bit pricier Retina model which starts at $1,699.
