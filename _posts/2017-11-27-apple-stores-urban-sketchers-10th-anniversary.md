* Urban Sketchers turns 10 today and Apple is joining the celebration by hosting free workshops at its brick-and-mortar outlets around the world to teach customers how to create sketches and illustrations on their iPad Pro with Apple Pencil.
* They’re highlighting works of four Urban Sketchers artists: Rob Sketcherman from Hong Kong, Don Low from Singapore, Omar Jamarillo from Berlin and Uma Kelkar from San Francisco.
* These artists, all of whom create with Apple’s tablet and stylus, will be teaching free of charge sketching classes scheduled to be held on Thursday, November 30 at Apple’s retail stores in San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore and Berlin.
* To sign up for free sketch walks, visit apple.com/today.

* Founded in 2007, Urban Sketchers is a global community of artists dedicated to fostering the practice of on-location drawing.
* “On those super stressful days when art is actually necessary—by not having to worry about spilling color, iPad Pro enables me to reconstitute myself,” said San Francisco’s Uma Kelkar.
* Rob Sketcherman, a self-taught artist and Urban Sketchers member for over four years, said:
* The flexibility iPad Pro offers fuels experimentation with line, texture and look, allowing any number of iterations. It’s also very forgiving, expelling all fear of the dreaded blank page and of potentially ‘ruining sketchbooks’ in case an experiment goes awry.
* He now creates artwork exclusively on iPad.
* Other artists have praised Apple Pencil features like low latency and reliable pressure and tilt sensitivity. The iPad Pro + Apple Pencil combo is a natural fit for drawing on location thanks to the mobility, flexibility and range of tools.
* Do you use Apple Pencil? If so, how do you like it so far?
