* Have you ever wished for a native way to shorten URLs in iOS? Obviously, you can easily do so with third-party apps, but iOS lacks a native way to shorten links on stock devices.
* If you’re jailbroken, however, it’s easy to shorten URLs directly from the copy and paste menu using a handy Action Menu add-on. The add-on, which is entitled Goo.gl shortener for Action Menu, allows you to shorten URLs directly from the copy and paste menu. Take a look at our video walkthrough to see how it works.
* To use Goo.gl shortener for Action Menu, highlight the entire URL and select the Goo.gl button from the copy and paste menu. You’ll see an overlay stating that the link was shortened followed by a second overlay stating that the shortened URL was copied. After the URL is copied, use the paste button to paste the new shortened URL in your desired location.

* It’s possible to select multiple URLs at once if you have a string of multiple URLs that you copy, but only the first URL in the string will be shortened. The developer says that he will add support for multiple URLs in a future update if requested.
