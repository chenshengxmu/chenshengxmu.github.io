* Weâ€™re big fans of the Mobile Cloth here at iDB. I remember the very first time I used one of their microfiber clothes to clean my iPhone screen. I didnâ€™t expect much at all but I was blown away by the results.
* In a matter of seconds the Mobile Cloth removes fingerprints and smudges, but it also removes up to 98% of germs, without the need of any chemicalâ€¦
* And itâ€™s a pretty inexpensive product too. They start at $6.99 for a 2-pack.
* Youâ€™ll probably agree that there isnâ€™t much to be excited about when talking about cleaning cloth though. And youâ€™re right. How do you make a cleaning cloth more exciting? Well, maybe by adding the iDB logo on top of it!
* Thatâ€™s what the guys over at Mobile Cloth have done. Itâ€™s actually part of their new offering for businesses, or anyone who would like to create a custom cleaning cloth. I think itâ€™s a great idea for app developers or for companies that exhibit at trade shows for example.
* They are offering an intro custom package of 200 cleaning clothes, including 100 Classic and 100 Nanos for $359 â€“ that includes shipping anywhere in the US & Canada. Thatâ€™s about $1.80 per package, and that is a good deal. So if you work for a company thatâ€™s looking for original schwag, maybe give Mobile Cloth a try.
* Now enough with the product pitch. Letâ€™s get to this giveaway, shall we?
* The Mobile Cloth folks were kind enough to offer 10 custom branded packs to iDB readers. Each pack includes 2 cleaning clothes: one Classic, and one Nano, as shown on the picture above.
