* Following last week’s iCloud unveiling of new iPhoto and GarageBand icons, Apple has revised its built-in apps page for the iPhone 5s to reveal several new icons that are believed to belong to upcoming app updates.
* Oddly enough, the revamped page also offers up some details about the new apps. And one of the tidbits we found particularly interesting was that the new GarageBand will be a free download with in-app purchases…
* Apple has since reverted its ‘built-in apps’ page, but not before MacRumors grabbed this screenshot:

* And this text on GarageBand:
* “GarageBand is free on the App Store for all iOS 7 compatible devices; additional GarageBand instruments and sounds are available with an in-app purchase. iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are free on the App Store for qualifying iOS 7 compatible devices activated on or after September 1, 2013.”
* Apple is expected to unveil the new apps at its media event on Tuesday. Other products on the menu include an updated iPad and iPad mini, new Retina MacBook Pros, Apple’s redesigned Mac Pro, and OS X Mavericks.
