* The iPhone may not have near field communications installed, but that’s not stopping companies from trying to integrate the tech. US Bank proves that yet again today by unveiling its new NFC-enabled iPhone case.
* The case is a major part of the bank’s new Go Mobile payment service, which will allow US Bank customers to pay for goods and services from their checking, savings or credit accounts using an NFC-compatible device…
* TUAW, who was first to spot the story, says that there’s no word on whether or not customers will be charged for the case. On their website, US Bank says the requirements are “an iPhone 4 or 4S and [the ability] to qualify for a US Bank FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa Signature card to use the US Bank Go Mobile Payment Service.”
* Last week, we saw Incipio unveil a similar NFC-enabled iPhone case at CES, called the CashWrap. But it is strictly for ISIS, the mobile payment service backed by major US carriers including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.
* Apple, for its part, has stayed away from NFC technology thus far, saying “it’s not clear that it’s the solution to any current problem.” Instead, Apple introduced Passbook last summer; a digital wallet that uses 2D barcodes.
