title: QuickSafari- Search Google From Anywhere

* QuickSafari is another Activator-based Google search tool, that allows you to perform searches and browse to specific URLs from anywhere on your iPhone.
* It’s a great tool, and one that I believe should be included as a native iOS feature. Until then, we’ll have to rely on the great jailbreak community to meet our needs in this area, and QuickSafari doesn’t disappoint…
* It’s funny, because I’ve heard a lot of chatter about this app being a rip off of another similarly named, and at one time, similarly functioning tweak — QuickGoogle.
* The complaints usually revolve around how QuickGoogle is free, and how QuickSafari is $0.99 on Cydia.
* What those people fail to realize, is that QuickGoogle no longer works. If you check Cydia, or you download it, you’ll see that it no longer performs searches due to some changes that Google made with their search interface.
* You also can’t perform direct URL requests using QuickGoogle, like you can in QuickSafari.
* Itay, the developer of QuickSafari, has received some backlash for his decision to charge, but most are unaware of the points mentioned above.
* Of course this is a personal matter, but I don’t mind shelling out $0.99 if a). I know I’m going to use it, and b). The developer keeps his app updated.
* Let me know what you think in the comments below.
* Update: And just like that, QuickGoogle was updated, and now works again. The developer also added direct URL browsing. They’re exactly the same now.
