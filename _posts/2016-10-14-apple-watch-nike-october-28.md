* A special edition of the Apple Watch Series 2 that Apple has created in partnership with Nike, will be going on sale two weeks from today, on Friday, October 28, according to an updated Apple Watch Nike+ webpage first spotted by French blog WatchGeneration. It’s what I wanted to hear as I’m in the market for the Nike+ edition of the new watch.
* Apple has said that the $369 Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ will have the same design, price and hardware features as the regular edition of the smartwatch, with the exception of special fluoroelastomer bands (available in a choice of four colors) that have perforations to reduce weight and improve ventilation.
* Advertised as your “perfect running partner,” Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ comes preloaded with Nike’s app which enables an elevated running experience. There are also Nike-branded watch faces and complications.
* The Nike app has basic and advanced mode, Siri integration, running reminders every Sunday and invitations to let you know you’re falling behind your workout regime.
* Owners of the device will be automatically enrolled in Nike+ Run Club, giving them access to live runs around the world.
* Apple’s boss Tim Cook has been a director at Nike since 2005. He is the Lead Independent Director of the Board of Directors of Nike.
