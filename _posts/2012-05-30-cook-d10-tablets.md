* One of the inevitable subjects technology columnists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher pressed Apple’s Cook on during yesterday’s D10: All Things Digital opening-night talk touches upon the post-PC world and the convergence dilemma. As you know, Cook’s predecessor Steve Jobs was a huge proponent of tablet computing.
* Jobs used to passionately defend the tablet with all his heart and soul, insisting on the post-PC revolution spearheaded by the iPad. So, here’s Cook’s take on tablets displacing PCs, the iPad, the assumed convergence of tablets and PCs and more…
* The iPad has been unbelievable. I think we’re in the first inning. There’s a few pretty much everywhere I go.
* The first inning?
* That’s simply about the iPad. I’ve always believed that the tablet market would be bigger than the PC market. Many people just laughed that off but today I think there’s a lot more believers than that.
* Okay, but who’s to say tablets and PCs won’t converge?
* Cook, of course.
* In my view, the tablet and the PC are different. And you can do things with the tablet, if you’re not encumbered by the legacy of the PC.
* But isn’t tablet just another screen?
* If you view it as different, if you take the view that says this is another PC, all of a sudden you’re pulling along all of the baggage of the PC market.
* This brings to mind a commercial Apple aired back in 2010 in order to sell us another screen in our lives.
* Hey, but what about products such as the Asus Transformer Prime? Isn’t there room for another category of device that falls somewhere between a tablet and a notebook?
* I said a few months ago, this flippant thing, you could converge a toaster and a refrigerator. Sure, you could do that. But I just think you wind up not building the best product, in this particular case, when you converge those.
* Cook first articulated the toaster-refrigerator dilema in an April conference call with analysts.
* But some folks beg to differ with Cook.
* Enter analyst Peter Misek, who speculated iOS and OS X would merge soon into one giant monster of an operating system, similar to how Windows 8 ws built to scale from the tiniest smartphone screens to monstrous 80-inch television sets.
* Tell me again like I’m a five-year old, why exactly is a marriage between the iPad and the MacBook doomed to fail?
* Trying to do all those things that the OS of the PC does, and perhaps should do, it’s trying to converge laptops and tablets and therefore you’ve got a clamshell kind of thing and you’re lugging this thing with you, and so the industrial design is not optimized for tablet.
* And let’s not forget this important expectation:
* People want tablets to be incredibly thin.
* So specs do matter then?
* But wait a second, are you telling me combining an ultra-thin MacBook Air with an ultra-thin iPad isn’t feasible?
* If you look at it as a notebook, you’re not going to come out of the design of the product and have it be a kick-ass product where someone says wow, this is what I wanted.
* I’m not big on that, as you can probably tell.
* He’s not big on that…
* It’s really not as simple as it sounds – even not that the iPad mainstreamed the tablet – to make the case for tablets and argue there’s no point in merging them with notebooks.
* Time will tell whether Cook stays true to his mantra.
* Remember, Steve Jobs had said video didn’t make sense on a portable music player and that Apple wasn’t interested in building a phone.
* So what do you guys think?
* Should Apple try to combine the iPad and the MacBook Air into a unique new tablet-meets-notebook category of device?
