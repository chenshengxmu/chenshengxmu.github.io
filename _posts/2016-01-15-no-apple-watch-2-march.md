* Don’t get your hopes up for new Apple Watch hardware in March, reports TechCrunch. Citing several sources with knowledge of the company’s plans, the outlet said on Friday that it believes the oft-rumored March unveiling is a bit too soon for Watch 2.0.
* The scoop goes directly against a recent report that the second-gen Apple Watch is set to begin production later this month. It also contradicts a December report from the reliable 9to5Mac, which said that Apple had been planning a Watch event for March.
* I’m not so sure that we’ll be seeing it that early. Several things that I’ve heard (from several sources) indicate to me that we won’t see a new hardware model of the Apple Watch in March. Design partnerships, accessories, that kind of thing maybe but not a “Watch 2.0” with a bunch of new hardware features like a camera. I could be wrong, of course, but I’ve heard enough to put it out there.
* The report goes on to point to lack of supply chain movement as evidence that a new Apple Watch isn’t nearing production—several Apple suppliers have warned of soft earnings. It also notes that there hasn’t been any “major action” from Watch software teams.
* That said, it still sounds like a March event is likely. The iPad Air 2 is long overdue for a refresh, and smoke for a 4-inch iPhone continues to billow. Apple could then save the Watch for September, giving it more breathing room and attention ahead of the holidays.
