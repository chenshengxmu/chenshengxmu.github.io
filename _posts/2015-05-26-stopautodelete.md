* When you hold the delete button on the iOS keyboard, eventually the cursor will start to delete entire words in an effort to speed up the deletion process. While at times, this comes in handy from a speed perspective, I often find it more of a nuisance; it seems to always delete words that I had no intention of removing.
* StopAutoDelete is a jailbreak tweak that slows down deleting on iOS, placing a sort of limiter on deleting and preventing whole words from being delete at once. Have a look at our video walkthrough for a full explanation.
* There are no settings or options to configure for StopAutoDelete. Just install it and you’re good to go.
* Although StopAutoDelete definitely slows down the otherwise inordinately fast deletion process, it can also save you from the hassle of accidentally deleting words that you had no intention of removing in the first place.
* If you’re looking to tame the fast deletion process that occurs when holding the delete button on your iPhone, then by all means give StopAutoDelete, a free jailbreak tweak on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, a thorough test drive.
