* In addition to Google Photos, Google announced at I/O today that it would be bringing another Android app over to iOS: Google Cardboard. The Mountain View tech giant says the software will “bring virtual reality to your iPhone.”
* For those unfamiliar with Cardboard, it debuted at last year’s I/O conference with the promise of bringing affordable virtual reality to the masses. All it requires is a cardboard viewer that you can either make yourself or buy for $20.

* If you’re interested, Google showcases a number of ‘Works with Cardboard’ viewers on its website that vary in price and design. Or you can find directions to make your own here. Cardboard works with any iPhone 5 or newer model.
* The app itself offers a handful of 3D adventures to get you started. There’s Explorer, which lets you explore various environments; Exhibit for viewing 3D museum objects; a kaleidoscope; and Urban Hike, a set of virtual city tours.
* Additionally, Google also said that it’s bringing its Cardboard SDK to iOS, which means third-party developers will be able to build apps and games for the 3D platform. Virtual reality gaming for under $20? Keep an eye on this initiative.
* Google Cardboard is available in the App Store for free.
