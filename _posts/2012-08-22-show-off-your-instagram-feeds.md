* Over the past two years, Instagram has provided a mobile platform for millions of people to share filtered photos of everything from sunsets to cups of coffee. And yes, even food.
* And now, the folks over at D2M are trying to provide a way for you to share these photos in a different way, with their Android-based, Instagram feeding photo frame…
* The Instacube is essentially a 7.5-inch digital picture fame that runs on a custom version of Android OS. It has a 6.5-inch, 600×600 capacitive touch screen, an ARM processor and 4GB of internal memory. It also has 256MB of RAM and built-in 802.11b/g/n WiFi.
* It uses all of these specs to deliver you your Instagrams at full resolution. Simply plug in Instacube, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and log into your Instagram account. You can use the touch screen to browse through your photos, and it even has a physcial “Like” button.
* If the video didn’t tip you off, Instacube is a Kickstarter project. The D2M team is trying to raise $250,000 to take their idea to the next level, and they shouldn’t have any problem doing so. With 30 days left, the project has already received $145,000 from 1,240 backers.
* For those of you who are interested in the Instacube, you can preorder yours through Kickstarter for just $149, or two of them for $199. Unfortunately they aren’t shipping until March 2013.
* What do you think of the Instacube?
