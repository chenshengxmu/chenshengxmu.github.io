* Imagine directions to a new location not stopping at the street address, or never getting lost in a new building again. Or, how about playing hide-and-seek in your house with your favorite game character or competing against a friend “for control over physical space with your own miniature army”?
* That’s the promise behind Project Tango, a new Google initiative which seeks to give mobile devices “a human-scale understanding of space and motion”.
* The brainchild of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, Project Tango is, on the surface, an unimpressive Android phone with a five-inch display and a four-megapixel camera.
* But scratch deeper and you’ll find custom hardware like two Computer Vision Processors, sensors for measuring geometry and seeing in three dimensions, a camera which tracks motion and other goodies that basically turn this handset into a device that can map your environments, track its motion in full 3D space and much more…
* Early prototypes of the device, of course, run Android and include development APIs to provide position, orientation and depth data to standard Android apps written in Java, C/C++, as well as the Unity Game Engine.
* Check out the promo clip.
* Project Tango is the result of a decade’s worth of research in robotics and computer vision across universities, research labs and Google’s industrial partners.
* The initiative involves Johnny Chung Lee, a computer scientist and Human-Computer Interaction researcher at Google, who is perhaps best known for his work on Kinect development and extending the functionality of the Wii Remote controller.

* Here’s Google’s pitch:
* What if you could capture the dimensions of your home simply by walking around with your phone before you went furniture shopping? What if directions to a new location didn’t stop at the street address? What if you never again found yourself lost in a new building?
* What if the visually-impaired could navigate unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places? What if you could search for a product and see where the exact shelf is located in a super-store?
* And this is what the prototype device looks like:

* The sensors track the full 3D motion of the device while simultaneously creating a map of the environment, according to Google:
* These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time, combining that data into a single 3D model of the space around you.
* Project Tango is an experimental device so don’t expect it to be sold to end users anytime soon. “Project Tango is a focused exploration of what might be possible in a mobile platform,” explains the firm. “It is not part of Android today”.
* “Today” here is key, I’d say.

* However, Google filed-testing Project Tango with cherry-picked developers indicates that the company is looking to add 3D depth sensing and environment mapping to mobile devices as soon as the technology is ready for prime time.
* Project Tango is available to a limited number of developers: initially, Google will hand out only 200 devices which are expected to ship by March 14.
* Here’s how 3D environment mapping works – it’s quite fascinating!
* To learn more and apply for a development kit, head over to Google’s official Project Tango website.
* I certainly would love my next iPhone to exhibit awareness of 3D space and motion.
