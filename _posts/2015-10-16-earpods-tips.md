* Those funky headphones that came with your iPhone—EarPods with Remote and Mic they’re called—only have 3 buttons but boy do they perform a surprising number of functions beyond volume control. And with built-in mic, your EarPods can make and receive phone calls and control media playback.
* Moreover, you can use them for recording voice memos, interacting with Siri hands-free, VoIP calling in apps like Skype and more, all with a pinch of the cord. Wait, I need this article to tell me how to plug my EarPods and listen to music?
* We’re not saying you’re not familiar with your EarPods. But as with other things in life, there are always new tricks to be learned. This post will hopefully help you master your EarPods like a pro.
* In this article, we’ll tell you all the cool things your EarPods can do, from rich playback control and controlling Siri to switching calls on the fly, using VoiceOver and so forth. We’ll also discuss EarPods compatibility, talk about keeping your headset in pristine condition and lay out sound advice for using your headset responsibly.
* Your Apple headset, or any other Bluetooth headset or headphones,can be used to listen to music, videos, audiobooks, podcasts and games. But the EarPods go much further than that. Let’s get started with the basics so everyone is on the same page.
* The EarPods with Remote and Mic are outfitted with built-in microphone for making calls, controlling your music playback and more. They also sport an integrated inline remote with volume up and down buttons. There’s also a third button called the center button, which does all the magic.

* The EarPods with Remote and Mic are bundled with all iPods and iPhones from the iPhone 5 onward, but not with iPads. A higher-quality version, the Apple In-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic, are available independently, for $79.
* Needless to say, third-party headphones will support your Apple gadgets, and most other devices for that matter, without any issues.
* You can use your EarPods to listen to music and videos and control media playback. And with iOS 9, your headset is even smarter. When you plug in your headphones, iOS 9’s Proactive assistant will recognize that you might want to play an album you started earlier.
* Like magic, your music will be ready to play straight from the Lock screen (you might need to swipe the Music icon up from the lower left corner to open the Music app). To control media playback with your EarPods, memorize the following shortcuts.
* You can use your headphones to take images and capture video in iOS’s stock Camera app, or in third-party camera apps that supports using the volume control to take images.
* If you own an Apple Watch, you can also use the Digital Crown to trigger the shutter remotely in third-party camera apps on your iPhone.
* There’s nothing more convenient than conversing with Siri hands-free. Not needing to pull an iPhone out of your pocket to interact with Siri is also a potential life-saver when you’re driving.
* To talk to Siri via your EarPods, use the following shortcuts.
* To control when Siri listens instead of letting her notice when you stop talking, simply continue to hold down the center button while you speak, and release it when you finish.
* Read our tutorial for more information on adjusting Siri audio feedback.
* With advanced functions like switching to an incoming or on-hold call and other features, all you need is your EarPods—your iPhone may stay in your pocket.
* Hearing-impaired will love VoiceOver-compatible music control through their EarPods. Supported features include announcing your music, switching playlists and more.
* Using VoiceOver with EarPods requires an iPhone 3GS or later, any iPad model, a third-generation iPod touch or later, a fifth-generation iPod nano or later or a third-generation iPod shuffle and later.
* EarPods features are available from the Lock screen even if Siri is turned off in Settings → General → Siri. When you disable Siri, limited voice-activated features, collectively called Voice Control, let you make phone calls and control music playback.

* Although Voice Control is unavailable when Siri is turned on, Voice Control for the Music app is always on. To keep Voice Control from dialing when your iPhone is locked, go to Settings → Touch ID & Passcode (iPhone 5s or later) or Settings → Passcode (other models), then set the Voice Dial switch to the OFF position.
* The EarPods support any iPhone, iPod touch and iPad model, but certain features may require newer devices. They also work with Macs like a charm, and with other smartphones and audio devices.
* The built-in mic is compatible with all iOS devices, but not all iPhones, iPods and iPads work with integrated volume control.

* It’s worth pointing out that Apple headsets bundled with the iPhone 4s or later in China differ somewhat from your regular EarPods.
* Aside from their dark insulating rings on the plug, these EarPods were designed to comply with Chinese standards and are only compatible with the iPhone 4s or later, iPad 2 or later, seventh-generation iPod nano or later and fifth-generation iPod touch and later.
* To see a list of Apple devices compatible with the EarPods, consult this support document. If you use a third-party headset, you should check with the vendor for compatibility information.
* Folks using a Bluetooth headset with their iOS hardware are advised to check out Bluetooth profiles that Apple supports in this support document.
* Your headphones sit in your ears and as such could cause skin irritation and even lead to ear infections, if not properly cleaned. Apple advises cleaning the earbuds frequently with an antiseptic like isopropyl alcohol.
* The remote buttons on your EarPods not working properly? Check for debris in the gap between the top and bottom covers of the remote. If that doesn’t help, try gently tapping the remote to dislodge debris or, if you still see debris, brush with a soft-bristled brush to remove any remaining particles.
* If the EU Volume Limit feature is enabled in Settings → Music → Volume Limit, your iPhone will prompt you when you attempt to pump up the volume above the EU recommended level for hearing safety.

* To increase the volume beyond this level, you may need to briefly release the volume control. Know that you’re risking possible hearing damage when listening at high volume levels for long periods of time.
* Your ears adapt over time to a higher volume of sound: that’s why high volume level might sound normal to you but still damage your hearing. To prevent changes to the volume limit, go to Settings → General → Restrictions.
* One more thing: if you experience a tiny electrostatic shock when using your EarPods, don’t panic. This is normal in areas where the air is very dry due to the build-up of static electricity. To avoid this phenomenon, touch a grounded unpainted metal object before inserting your EarPods.
* On a final note, any use of earphones while operating a vehicle is not recommended and is illegal in many countries so be attentive while driving and use your EarPods responsibly.
