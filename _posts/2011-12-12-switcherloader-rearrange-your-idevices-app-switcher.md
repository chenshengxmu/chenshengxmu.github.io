* Interested in customizing your App Switcher? What about completely removing certain stock features, like AirPlay and music controls?
* With SwitcherLoader — a new jailbreak tweak available on Cydia — it’s all possible, and then some.
* SwitcherLoader is a free tweak available for iOS 4.2 devices and above. Check inside for a full video explanation of what this tweak brings to the table.
* By default, SwitcherLoader includes options to enable or disable AirPlay features, music controls, and your dock along with the accompanying icons in the dock.
* You can even rearrange the “plugins” to appear in a certain order if you wish to do so. Hopefully more developers will hop on board and release add-ons in support of SwitcherLoader. If the rest of the jailbreak community gets behind it, it could be an extremely handy tweak to have.
* What do you think about SwitcherLoader?
