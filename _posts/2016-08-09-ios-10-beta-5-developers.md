* Apple on Tuesday seeded the fifth beta of iOS 10 to developers. Registered developers running the latest betas can access the update via the OTA mechanism in iOS, or as a standalone download via Apple’s developer center.
* Beta 5 comes just one week after the fourth beta, suggesting Apple has entered the fine-tuning stage as it prepares for a public release next month. Beta 4 added new emoji, new keyboard sounds and several other minor tweaks.
* Introduced in June, iOS 10 offers a number of new features and improvements. It’s compatible with the iPad 4 and later, the iPad mini 2 and later, the iPhone 5 and later, and the 6th gen iPod touch.
* We are currently installing today’s beta, and will be sure to report back with any notable changes. If you spot something we’ve missed, leave a comment below or email us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
