* After adding Waze incident reports to the mobile Google Maps app on the iPhone and iPad, the search Goliath today issued a minor update adding a few new features which expand on the application’s capabilities. In addition to some housekeeping and a pair of new Middle East languages, Google Maps has brought out improvements to navigation that will help plan your next trip or make real-time decisions based on traffic conditions, especially when you’re driving…
* In addition to bug fixes, Google Maps version 2.3.4 lets you access navigation faster. Now, I don’t use navigation much on my mobile devices, but when I do I expect to be able to plot a route from A to B without much hassle so this is clearly a nice improvement.
* Better yet, Google Maps navigation on your iOS devices now comes with route and traffic overview, which lets you make last-minute decisions based on traffic conditions and other aspects of your route.
* Previously, you’d only be able to see your route and all of the stops, but not much else.
* In case you’ve forgotten how to access a specific feature, the new Tips and Tricks section available in the side menu should come in handy, especially if you’re a non-power user. I’ve seen tips sections in Google’s other iOS apps before and am glad it’s becoming a thing.
* Last but not least, Google Maps supports Arabic and Hebrew, including voice guidance in navigation.
* Your release notes:
* ● Faster access to navigation, complete with route and traffic overview ● Tips and Tricks available in the side menu ● Arabic and Hebrew now supported, including voice guidance in navigation, where available ● Bug fixes
* Note that enhanced navigation capabilities and the Tips and Tricks section were first added to Google Maps on Android back in September.
* Download Google Maps free from the App Store.
* On the desktop front, Google last week rolled out a series of improvements to Google Maps on the web, such as directions for multiple destinations, the ability to quickly see your flight, hotel and restaurant reservations, a new Upcoming Events card that list events happening near you and other treats.
