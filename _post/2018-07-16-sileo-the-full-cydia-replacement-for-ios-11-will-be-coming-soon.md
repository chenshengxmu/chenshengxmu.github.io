* After a long period of silence from Saurik himself, it now appears that the Electra Team is moving forward with plans for an alternative to Cydia as a third-party extension store.
* The Electra Team calls their project “Sileo,” and it will be a full-featured, user-friendly GUI in which jailbreakers can search for and download new jailbreak tweaks, themes, and much more.
* Teaser footage shared via CoolStar’s YouTube channel demonstrates the Sileo user interface in action:

* Looks beautiful, right?
* According to CoolStar, Cydia only works with iOS 11 because of the countless “band-aids, zip ties, and velcro” that were implemented to make it so. Given that it’s no longer being maintained by Saurik as actively as it once was, the Electra Team believes that it’s time for a fresh start.
* Sileo has been carefully crafted with 64-bit devices in mind; that said, it will only work on jailbroken iOS 11 devices. Those jailbroken on iOS 10 and earlier will continue to use Cydia, as Sileo will not be made backward-compatible.

* It’s also worth mentioning that Sileo works seamlessly with your existing setup. It will recognize all the purchases you’ve made in Cydia previously, and the new interface should cooperate nicely with your favorite repositories, including Packix.

* CoolStar also mentions that the team is working on Safe Mode and Substitute replacements for iOS 11, and this is exciting news for jailbreakers that are concerned about installing potentially-harmful packages.
* The following teaser of the upcoming Safe Mode screen for Electra1131 reminds us of just how dated the old-fashioned Safe Mode screen truly was:
