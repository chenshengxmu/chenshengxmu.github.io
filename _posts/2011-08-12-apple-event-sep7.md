* We’re all waiting for the imminent announcement of a new iPhone, new iPods and probably “One more thing…” right now. And if reports are correct, we might not be waiting much longer.
* A Japanese site going by the name of Kodawarisan says that Apple will be holding a media event as soon as September 7th — that’s less than a month away…
* September has been the month for new iPod announcements for the past three years, and with iOS 5 slated for a release in the same month, this particular rumor does indeed make sense. Possible iPhone 5 release dates have ranged from late September to mid October, which again fits in well with an early September announcement.
* According to MacRumors, Kodawarisan has had good success in the past, with the Japanese site successfully predicting the launch of a new Mac Mini back in 2009.
* We at iDownloadBlog have very little experience with the Japanese site, so even with the numbers adding up, we’re willing to take this with a sizeable pinch of salt.
