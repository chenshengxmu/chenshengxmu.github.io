* There’s nearly a full second of delay after pressing your Home button before the app you’re in actually closes. Whether you love or hate the delay remains to be seen, but if you aren’t fond of it, now there’s something you can do about it.
* Installing a new free jailbreak tweak called Accelerated Home Button by iOS developer Mehul Rao from Cydia virtually eliminates the delay effect, making access to your Home screen instantaneous after pressing the Home button.
* So why is that delay there in the first place? Mostly because Apple wants to let your device think for a moment and see what your next action is going to be. If you press the Home button once, you go to the Home screen, but if you press the Home button twice or three times ocnsecutively, something else happens entirely.
* The short pause after pressing the Home button once lets the device wait for additional presses so that it can seamlessly open the App Switcher or provide you with Guided Access/Zoom options without any jitter in animations, assuming you want to.
* Accelerated Home Button will make these animations more jittery, but the speed at which it closes out of apps immediately after the Home button is pressed might be preferred by some over the stock timing tolerances.
* Apart from disabling the delay that you normally experience when the Home button is pressed, there really isn’t much more to the tweak. With that in mind, you really have to try it and judge it for yourself to find out if you like it.
* Accelerated Home Button doesn’t have any options to configure, so if you ever want to revert back to the original timing, you will have to uninstall the tweak from Cydia.
* To give Accelerated Home Button a try on your jailbroken iPhone or iPad, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repository, where you’ll find it as a free download.
* If you have a Touch ID sensor, you might also like a tweak called FingerTouch, which lets you assign unique touch-best gestures to your Home button.
