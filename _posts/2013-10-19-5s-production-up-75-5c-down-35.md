* Marketing research firm NPD DisplaySearch has added to recent reports this weekend that Apple is telling its suppliers to cut iPhone 5c production and increase 5s output.
* Citing ‘channel checks,’ the firm sent out a research note yesterday claiming that the Cupertino company is cutting 5c orders by 35%, and increasing 5s orders by 75%…
* From yesterday’s research note (via AllThingsD):
* “The diverging fates of Apple’s iPhone 5s and 5c have been widely reported, and our latest channel checks confirm that Apple indeed has cut back 5c production by 35% and increased 5s production by 75%.
* …While the fate of the iPhone 5c is still to be determined, the iPhone 5s is doing quite well, indicating that Apple still has a strong hardcore base for its premium devices. It is worth mentioning that iPhone 5 production is scheduled to end Q3 2013; iPhone 4s’s end of life is still to be determined, as it still receives orders of 1 to 2 million units per month and only recently started selling in Indonesia.”
* DisplaySearch’s report follows a similar one from The Wall Street Journal, which also noted the increases and decreases in 5s/5c orders. And they both echo a story from C Technology.
* The consensus from much of the tech world seems to be that Apple cutting 5c orders is a sign that it’s not selling well, but there are also several valid counter-arguments to this theory.
* Of course, we won’t know anything for sure until Apple announces its iPhone sales on October 28. I doubt they’ll break out 5s and 5c figures, but if the total is big enough, it won’t matter.
