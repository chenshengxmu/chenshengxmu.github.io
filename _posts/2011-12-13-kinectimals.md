* Microsoft is on something of a roll right now, with iOS apps rolling out of Redmond faster than you can say “Steve Ballmer.” We’ve already had My Xbox LIVE and SkyDrive come from the mobile developers at Microsoft over the last few days, and now we’ve been treated to a new game.
* Fans of the Xbox Kinect will know all about Kinectimals, a game that gives gamers a way to interact with virtual pets using the Kinect hands-free gaming accessory. If you are already a Kinectimals player on your Xbox 360, the new iOS app will unlock some more cubs for you to play with. You know, if that’s your thing.
* This irresistible mobile experience gives you the chance to use your phone to visit the island of Lemuria and play with, care for and fall in love with your very own cub. Bring your pet with you wherever you go!
* While Kinectimals may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it is great to see Microsoft’s sudden desire to release top-quality mobile apps for Apple’s devices. Yes, they are all versions of apps that were also developed for Windows Phone 7 devices, and the iOS versions do usually lack some of the WP7 features, but Microsoft clearly sees iOS as a platform that it needs to support.
* If you are going to give Kinectimals a try on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad, then you’ll need to part with $2.99 in order to do so.
