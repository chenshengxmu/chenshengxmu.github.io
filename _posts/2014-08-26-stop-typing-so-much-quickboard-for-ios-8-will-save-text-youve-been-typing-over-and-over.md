* A new third-party keyboard called QuickBoard wants to stop you from drone-lessly typing out the same information over and over. These iPhones have tiny screens, after all!
* Set to launch this fall with iOS 8’s new third-party keyboard support, QuickBoard has three separate keyboard entities, TextBoard, MeBoard, and LocationBoard, that allows you to store snippets of text instead of typing it out over and over again.
* QuickBoard hopes to save you time from typing email signatures, billing addresses, location, and more. The app adds a QuickBoard button to the bottom left of the keyboard, that when pressed, brings up all of the text information you’ve saved to the app. In a video demo released for the app, it shows QuickBoard has a swipeable interface, and even a location button.
* QuickBoard highlights exactly why it was a smart move for Apple to open third-party keyboard support within iOS 8 – a feature Android has had since its inception. We’ve been familiar with swipeable keyboards for sometime, like TouchPal and Swype, but QuickBoard offers a new take we haven’t seen before.
* Kevin Wolkober is the developer behind the keyboard, and he tells MacRumors QuickBoard will be released shortly after iOS 8 officially launches in the fall. There’s still no word on pricing.
