* In announcing financial results for the March 2014 quarter, Apple surprised analysts by reporting basically flat iPad growth.
* Compared to the same quarter in 2013, sales of the Apple tablet hit the 16.35 million unit mark versus analyst consensus of 19.7 million units. More worryingly, it’s a 16 percent annual drop from the 19.5 million iPads moved in the year-ago quarter.
* Slowing growth is the new normal rather than an anomaly because the tablet market as a whole has seen little innovation lately, cautions Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty…
* She wrote in a note to clients, via Business Insider:
* We lower our 2014 tablet growth forecast to 12 percent from 26 percent on the back of increasing penetration rates and the lack of new, differentiated products.
* Although slower tablet growth should help PC demand, our global PC model remains largely unchanged at -5 percent in 2014 and 2015.
* She claims suppliers attribute this slowdown to two key factors: increased penetration rates – as in, most people who wanted a tablet already have one – and lack of meaningful innovation.
* Although Android “appears to be faring better than iOS tablets” due to their lower prices and broader product portfolios, suppliers are now counting on seeing growth coming from larger-screened tablets further cannibalizing traditional notebooks.
* While this does not bode well for Apple, it’s perfectly understandable that the tablet market just can’t be as competitive as the smartphone market.
* Though smartphones have become commoditized, ubiquitous and indispensable, that sector continues to experience a double-digit growth and here’s why
* Firstly, one does not need to fork out a couple hundred bucks to get a smartphone because most carriers, especially those in the United States, subsidize smartphones so you could get a decent handset with no upfront payment whatsoever.
* Compare this to tablets, which are largely sold unsubsidized and therefore cost more upfront. Secondly, a tablet isn’t something an average person necessarily depends on, as opposed to a smartphone.
* Thirdly, I can certainly sympathize with the ‘lack of meaningful innovation’ argument. For those who own an iPad 3 or iPad 4, the iPad Air – despite its dramatically thinner and lighter appearance – just isn’t a substantial enough upgrade to justify the purchase.
* And lastly, upgrade cycles for tablets are longer than a typical two-year upgrade path for smartphones.
* Anyway, I want to hear what you think about the flat iPad growth.
* Can the next iPad revitalize growth of the sector, do you think?
* Should Apple be concerned about tablet flat sales? And if so, does the firm need an even cheaper tablet than its lowest-price $299 iPad mini to revert the trend?
