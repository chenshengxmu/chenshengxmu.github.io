* Cricket Australia launched a new channel on Apple TV this week, reports The Sydney Morning Herald, making it the first sports streaming channel on the set-top box in the country. The move will bring high-definition and exclusive content to fans down under.
* The channel will offer access to behind-the-scenes footage, skills tutorial videos, news and daily highlights for the sport. It won’t, however, feature live match broadcasts—for that you’ll still have to tune into Channel Nine or buy access to its live streaming service.
* While today’s news doesn’t affect many Apple TV owners, it does underscore Apple’s quest to add global and region-specific content to its TV platform. The company has given its set-top box little love since 2012, but it’s added a number of new channels.
