* Apple just posted a video presentation of the iPad 3 on its website. It’s not available on YouTube or for download yet, but I assume it’s just a matter of time.

* Go over Apple’s website to see how beautiful the Retina display looks on the iPad 3…
* We’ll update this post once we can embed the video.
