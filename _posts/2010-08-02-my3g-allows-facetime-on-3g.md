title: My3G Allows FaceTime on 3G
---
* It was only a matter of time until you would be able to use FaceTime on 3Gâ€¦ Say hello to My3G. Developed by the same people who brought us MyWi, My3G is very similar to 3G Unrestrictor except it has support for FaceTime.
* Here are the features as described in the app description:
* My3G is available from both Cydia and Rock. The Rock version will cost you $3.99 while the Cydia version via ModMyI repo will cost you $2.79.
* [9 to 5 Mac]
