* iH8sn0w has posted a minor update to his popular jailbreak utility sn0wbreeze this weekend, bringing the software to version 2.9.9. The update comes just a few days after 2.9.8 was released, and features a handful of bug fixes.
* The Windows-only app includes the new untethered evasi0n jailbreak, which the evad3rs debuted last week, and is capable of hacking all pre-A5 devices on iOS 6.1 (including the Apple TV 2). Full 2.9.9 change log after the fold…
* Change log for sn0wbreeze 2.9.9, via iH8sn0w’s blog:
* Again, this is essentially a maintenance update to help eradicate some of the problems users were having with the previous version. So if you already used the app to jailbreak your device, and things are working fine, you can ignore this.
* As usual, you can find the latest version of sn0wbreeze on our Downloads page. If you’re an expert, feel free to dive right in. Otherwise, if you’re looking for help, I imagine it won’t be too long before Jeff comes around with a how-to video.
