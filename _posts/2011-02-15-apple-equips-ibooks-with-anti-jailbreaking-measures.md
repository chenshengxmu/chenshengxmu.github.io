* It looks like Apple is getting a bit more serious with the back and forth antics between it and the jailbreak community.
* The latest casualty in the hacking war is iBooks, or more accurately, people that use iBooks.
* Basically Apple has implemented anti-jailbreak measures in iBooks, and I have to admit, it’s kind of sneaky the way they pulled it off.
* How’d they do it? Check inside for the video evidence…
* Slyly, Apple has equipped iBooks with a procedure that attempts to run unsigned code. Bear in mind that this is the type of code that will only execute on a jailbroken iPhone.
* Hence, if the code successfully runs, iBooks knows your iPhone is jailbroken, and sends you a nice little dialogue prompting you to restore your iPhone back to factory settings!
* If it doesn’t run, then iBooks knows you’re working with a stock iPhone, and lets you open your book.

* Keep in mind that these are all books that you legitimately purchased. It’s very annoying that I can’t read a book that I shelled out my hard earned money for just because I’ve jailbroken my iPhone.
* But that’s another topic for another day; the point is, Apple looks to be continuing its efforts to discourage jailbreaking.
* Something tells me the inability to read a book on a 3.5″ screen isn’t going to thwart the plans of the jailbreak community.

* For the record, I’ve actually noticed this happening periodically ever since updating to iOS 4.0. No doubt all jailbreak tools will contain workarounds for this issue in the near future.
* What are your thoughts on this ongoing saga?
