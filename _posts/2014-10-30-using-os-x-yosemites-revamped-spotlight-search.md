* Spotlight has been improved through and through to be more useful in OS X Yosemite. It has adopted an Alfred-inspired interface that makes working with Spotlight easier and more powerful.
* Want to see some of the main differences in action? Have a look at our video walkthrough as we showcase some of the new things that Spotlight has to offer.
* Like its iOS counterpart, Spotlight can look up information from a variety of sources. Those sources include: Maps, Wikipedia, iTunes, Fandango, and Bing. Spotlight is also great for local file search, and returns dynamic results with improved previews and information about those results.
* Spotlight has always been used to launch apps, but now, thanks to its front and center interface, launching apps via Spotlight feels more natural. There’s even a calculator built into Spotlight for performing equations and conversions.
* What do you think about Spotlight in OS X Yosemite? Is it good enough to work as your daily launcher/search tool on the desktop? Or will you be sticking to a utility like Alfred?
