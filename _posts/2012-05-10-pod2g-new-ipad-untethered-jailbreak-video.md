* Earlier today we reported about pod2g’s progress on the new iPad 5.1 untethered jailbreak. It seems that we are now closer than ever to seeing this jailbreak released as pod2g teased us with a demo video of the untethered jailbreak in action.
* Published a few minutes ago on his blog, the video shows a fully functional iPad 3 running Cydia and going through a reboot…
* The best of all is that, according to pod2g, if this jailbreak works on the iPad 3 and the iPhone 4, it should work for all devices, including the iPhone 4S.
* Let’s just sit back and wait. Something tells me we’ll see this jailbreak real soon.
* Excited much?
