* I found this awesome lockscreen on Cydia yesterday, with a little help from AtomicMufin on Twitter. It’s called TypoPhone 4 and it’s basically a lockscreen theme that shows the time and date in large bold letters. It also contains this cool unlock slider. You can download it from Cydia and activate it with Winterboard.
* To have it look exactly like the image above, you’ll also need to download Lockscreen Clock Hide from Cydia, which like the name suggests, hides the clock on your iPhone.

* I think that’s an awesome mod and it is without a doubt the coolest iPhone lockscreen I’ve seen so far. Now this thing just needs a little bit of colors to make it perfect.
* What do you guys think? You like it?
