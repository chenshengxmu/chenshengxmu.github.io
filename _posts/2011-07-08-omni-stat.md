* We’ve seen a slew of iOS 5 widgets over the last couple of days. For those who don’t know, Apple released a beta version of their new iOS software a few weeks ago, and the jailbreak community has marked their territory in the Notification Center drop down menu.
* So far there’s been no word from Apple yet on whether or not 3rd party developers are going get to use the space to create custom widgets, but that hasn’t stopped jailbreak developers. One of the latest widgets to surface is OmniStat…
* This utility puts all kinds of information at your fingertips. Simply by pulling down the Notification Center menu, you can see your iDevice’s free disk space, and model information. Then by swiping to the right, you can see your IP address, running processes and more.
* iPhoneItalia points out that this one of the most complete widgets offered yet for the new iOS firmware, and I’d have to agree. Combine this with UISettings and you essentially have SBSettings on steroids.
* This tweak is especially useful if your customized iDevice is living on the edge of RAM and hard disk space, you’ll constantly know where you stand. OmniStat is available for free in Cydia via the new iOS 5 BigBoss repo, which is http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/ if you don’t have it yet.
* Have you tried OmniStat out? What do you think?
