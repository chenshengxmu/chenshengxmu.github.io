* The Spotify Music app usually adopts a black and green color scheme, but that doesn’t mean you have to settle if you’d prefer to change things up. A new free jailbreak tweak called Colorify by iOS developer chloeeisoaky lets you change the app’s color scheme to your liking.
* Shown above, you can gaze upon some examples of how the Spotify Music app looks after modifying its core colors. These include the background, the tabs at the bottom of the app, and even the text that describes the music you’re looking at.
* Once you’ve installed Colorify, you can pay a visit to the Settings app and tinker with some of its settings:

* Here, you can:
* Thanks to the modular customization that Colorify brings to the table, you can add virtually any splash of color to your Spotify Music app that you might want without having to pick from developer-made presets.
* If you’re into color-based colorization of this nature and predominantly use Spotify to listen to your favorite tunes, then Colorify may be a worthwhile stop. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 and iOS 11 devices with the free Spotify Music app installed.
* Colorify is available from the Packix repository in Cydia for $1.49. Because this isn’t a default repository, you’ll need to add it to Cydia yourself by following the steps below:
* 1) Launch the Cydia app and go to the Sources tab.
* 2) Tap on the Edit button and then tap on the Add button.
* 3) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL:
* 4) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia.
* After completing all four steps, you can find, purchase, and install Colorify on your device by searching Cydia or checking the Changes tab once the app is done “Reloading Data.”
