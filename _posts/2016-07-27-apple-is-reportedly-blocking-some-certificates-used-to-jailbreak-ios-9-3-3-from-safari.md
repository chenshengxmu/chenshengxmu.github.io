title: Apple is reportedly revoking some certificates used to jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 from Safari

* Over the weekend, Pangu and 25PP launched a jailbreak for iOS 9.2-9.3.3, and not long after, iOS developers found a way to make the jailbreak possible via the Safari web browser without the need to use a computer.
* Unfortunately, however, Apple appears to be blocking the enterprise certificate that has been used in this process, so attempting jailbreaks from the device itself isn’t currently working.
* Those who attempt to jailbreak iOS 9.2-9.3.3 with many web-based jailbreak tools for iOS 9.3.3 will get an error like the one above, which states “Unable to Download App – ‘PPJailbreak’ could not be installed at this time.”
* The prompt gives the users two options: Done and Retry, but retrying the download isn’t going to do you any good, since the certificate is being blocked.
* Not all web-based jailbreak tools are receiving this error, as Apple is currently cracking down on misuse of the enterprise certificate system and hasn’t gotten to all of them.
* Apple is doing this to improve the security of the certificate system as a whole, as this is technically considered misuse of the enterprise certificate system despite how much those of us who rely on it to jailbreak our devices find it useful.
* The iOS developer behind the web-based tool we showed you this week is reportedly working on a fix for the problem. In the mean time, those who want to jailbreak iOS 9.2-9.3.3 can still use the Windows-based jailbreak tool from 25PP, which is still currently in Chinese only, as Pangu hasn’t yet gotten around to launching an English version of the tool.
* If you have already jailbroken one of your devices with the browser-based jailbreak, then you still should be fine for the time being. If any issues do occur, you can always try re-running the Windows jailbreak tool over your existing jailbreak.
* Because the jailbreak relies on Apple’s certificate system, they are bound to expire regardless of how you jailbroke.
* In addition, the jailbreak is also semi-untethered, which means you need to run the PPJailbreak app from your Home screen every time that you reboot your device in order for Cydia and all of your jailbreak tweaks to reinitialize after a reboot. If you don’t they’ll cease working until you do.
* If you’re already jailbroken, then you should be good to go until the certificate expires. At that point, you will need to use another certificate, which is where the Windows-based jailbreak tool is going to come in. Hopefully, the developers behind the Safari-based jailbreak will be able to create their fix before the expired certificate begins affecting jailbreakers.
