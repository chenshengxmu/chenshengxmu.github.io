* Suppose you’re a parent to a little monster who just wouldn’t stop relentlessly exploring the world around them. Or, maybe you own a cat that likes to play games on your iPad. No cat? Well, how about a naughty little nephew who would tap-tap-tap on your unattended iPhone like there’s no tomorrow?
* TL;DR: let others use your device and risk accidental app deletions lest you do something about it.
* In this tutorial, you’re going to learn how to set up an iOS device so that no one will be able to delete apps from it without knowing your restrictions passcode.
* My iPad-totting Mom used to have exactly the same problem where she would delete apps by accident.
* Apple, in all its wisdom, has  thought about those among us who play 24/7 tech support for our families and has mercifully implemented some rather useful options within iOS’s robust restriction settings to make our daily mobile computing easier.
* 1) Go to Settings → General → Restrictions on your device.
* 2) If asked, provide your Restrictions passcode.

* People who have not used Restrictions before must tap Enable Restrictions at the top in order to define a restrictions passcode that’s necessary to change these settings.
* Tip: For your own security, your restrictions passcode should be different from the passcode for unlocking your iOS device. If you forget your restrictions passcode, you won’t be able to adjust Restrictions unless your restore the software on your device.
* 3) In the section with the Allow headline, toggle the switch labeled Deleting Apps to the OFF position.

* 4) Don’t forget to tap the back arrow until you’re out of Restrictions and back at the main Settings menu. Otherwise, these changes won’t take effect if you just quit Settings.
* Flipping the toggle removes the “x” from the bottom left corner of deletable Home screen icons. That way, even if someone enters jiggle mode they won’t be able to actually delete any apps from your device.

* To prevent the installation of new apps, set the Installing Apps switch in Restrictions to the OFF position. You can even disable In-App Purchases that way.
