* Developer The Iconfactory today announced it’s releasing Linea, a brand new $9.99 iPad drawing app that’s specifically optimized for Apple Pencil users. Why does the world need another iPad drawing app? According to The Iconfactory, Linea focuses on the simple act of sketching.
* It’s based on a minimal user interface that doesn’t inundate you with extensive controls fond in other apps which get in the way when you’re trying to figure out where to start.
* Linea generates tints and shades automatically so you don’t have to though you’re free to choose from a variety of pre-defined colors or customize colors with a single tap.
* The app supports layers in a simplified form that developers claim is easy to understand and quick to manipulate. “Once you start using Linea, you’ll realize that it has a great advantage over a traditional sketchbook,” they noted.
* Doing away with a predefined grid, Linea gives you several choices like standard graph paper, dots, isometric guides and more. It’s not just for random sketching—Linea includes templates for quick storyboarding, iOS app icon design and development.
* And when you’re ready to export your work, Linea’s lets you select which part of your drawing you’d like to share through iOS’s multi-purposed sharing panel.
