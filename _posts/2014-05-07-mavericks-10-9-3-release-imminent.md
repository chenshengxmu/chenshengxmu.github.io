* After seeding eight major builds of the upcoming third Mavericks software update to its developers, Apple appears to be on the verge of releasing the software for public consumption. According to web reports, the iPhone maker has now distributed a new OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 build 13D62 to AppleCare employees, a tell-tale sign of an imminent arrival as Apple’s support army familiarize themselves with the new software…
* The last build for developers was labeled 13D55 versus today’s build 13D62 for AppleCare staff. The previous build for AppleCare employees had a version number of 13D59 and was labeled as pre-release software.
* That the most recent build lacks the ‘pre-release’ label tells us that a finalized version should drop anytime now.

* As the third major update to Apple’s desktop operating system powering Macs, OS X 10.9.3 should help fix some more bugs and resolve general issues plaguing the system. More importantly, it will enable long-expected native support for external 4K displays.
* We’re also expecting faster graphics, a bunch of security related fixes and hopefully some major improvements to Apple’s stock Mail app, which to this date continues to exhibit odd behavior.
