* Apple Maps customers in Croatia and Slovenia can now use a lane guidance feature.
* Lane guidance debuted in the United States and China with iOS 11 last September.
* As noted by Apple’s freshly updated iOS Feature Availability webpage, lane guidance was available in the following markets at the time of this writing:
* The feature provides a set of directional arrows at the top of the Apple Maps interface in navigation mode that indicate which lane your vehicle should be in to exit a freeway or complete a turn. Lane guidance is available in Maps for iPhone, iPad and CarPlay.
* Siri also gives you audio lane guidance in navigation mode
* Back in January, lane guidance expanded to New Zealand, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden after going live in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK last November.
* Although the Maps app has not received any outward-facing new user features in iOS 12, the company’s CarPlay feature has picked up much-needed support for third-party navigation apps from the likes of Goole, Waze, TomTom and others. These apps are displayed right on your car’s dash next to your favorite music, messaging, calling and automaker apps.
