* Apple has seeded the second beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 this afternoon. The update, labeled build 14C78c, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Dev Center for all registered Mac developers.
* Today’s release comes a little more than two weeks after the first 10.10.2 beta, and Apple has asked developers to focus on Wi-Fi connectivity. Users have complained of Wi-Fi issues since updating to Yosemite in October.
* Given that this is a minor update, we don’t expect much outside of a few bug fixes. But we’re installing the beta now, and will update this post with anything of note. If you find something, e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
