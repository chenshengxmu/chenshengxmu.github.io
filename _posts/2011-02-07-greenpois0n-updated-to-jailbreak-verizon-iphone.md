* According to reports, a few lucky people have already started receiving their pre-ordered Verizon iPhones, which should officially be available to the rest of the US this coming Friday.
* Ahead of the official Verizon launch date, the Chronic Dev Team has updated GreenPois0n to jailbreak iOS 4.2.6. We now have a proof that the jailbreak was successful as this picture was released earlier todayâ€¦
* Unless this picture was Photoshopped, it clearly shows it is indeed a Verizon iPhone (see the black bar connecting the antennas) running Cydia.
* The newest version of the jailbreak, GreenPois0n RC5 b4 can be downloaded from our downloads section. The jailbreak guide remains the same.
