* In case you didn’t get the memo, macOS High Sierra is the last release of Apple’s desktop operating system that supports 32-bit apps out of the box without any compromise.
* This is going to affect both third-party apps that are distributed through Mac App Store and software available for manual download through developers’ websites.
* Starting in macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, a user is notified on the launch of an app that depends on 32-bit software frameworks. The alert appears only once per app.
* To prepare for a future in which 32-bit software will no longer run without compromise, it may be a good idea to figure out which of the installed apps found on your computer are still 32-bit.
* Here’s how…
* 1) Choose About This Mac from the Finder’s Apple menu.

* 2) Click the button labeled System Report.

* 3) Click Software in the lefthand column.
* 4) Click the Applications sub-section.
* TIP: You may need to wait a few seconds until your Mac has finished scanning your disk and created a list of all the third-party apps installed on the computer.
* 5) Click an app in the list on the lefthand side, then check out the column labeled 64-Bit (Intel) on the righthand side of the System Information window..
* If the selected app’s entry below the header reads “Yes”, the app is 64-bit.

* Conversely, if it reads “No”, the app is 32-bit only.
* If you depend on legacy apps, there isn’t much you can do about the situation aside from reaching out to their developers. If your favorite developers won’t be adding 64-bit compatibility support anytime soon, maybe it’s time to start finding alternatives.
* TUTORIAL: How to identify 32-bit apps on your iPhone and iPad
* iOS 11 has completely removed support for 32-bit apps in September 2017.
* On iOS 11 and later, identifying legacy 32-bit apps is just as easy as it is on your Mac. Just venture to Settings → General → About, then tap Applications to see a list of installed apps on the device that have not switched to 64-bit yet.

* If nothing happens when you tap Applications, all of your installed apps are 64-bit.
