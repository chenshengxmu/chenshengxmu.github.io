* Popular Apple accessory maker Satechi today launched a sleek and compact hub that adds a bunch of missing ports to your MacBook Pro (late-2016 model), including two USB 3.0 ports (so you can charge your iOS devices without having to purchase a new cable), an HDMI port with support for 4K video output, a pair of SD/microSD memory card readers and more.
* The hub has two Thunderbolt 3 dongles that take up both USB-C ports of the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar (don’t worry, you also have an additional passthrough Thunderbolt 3 port).
