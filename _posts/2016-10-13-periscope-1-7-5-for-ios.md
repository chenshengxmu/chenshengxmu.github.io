* Periscope, Twitter’s live video-streaming app, has been refreshed in the App Store this morning with a few new features related to in-app camera, sharing and more. For starters, you’ll notice improved tap-to-focus while broadcasting live video, plus you can now follow a broadcaster from the viewers list with one tap. There are also improvements to Persicope’s VIP Program and more.
* Other new features in Periscope 1.7.5 for iOS include the ability to retweet the broadcaster’s original tweet when sharing a live broadcast, new badges on profiles that help identify broadcasters who are in the Periscope VIP Program, and a new icon next to the name and comments of broadcasters you follow, making it easier to identify them.
* Download Periscope for free from the App Store.
