* Whether you’re struggling to keep a New Year’s resolution, or just trying to tone up before beach season, everyone could use a little extra support. Luckily, there’s an app for that.
* In fact, we’ve found several apps that help you accomplish your fitness goals by tracking your steps and workouts, tracking your food intake, and offering support and motivation.

* When you first get started on an exercise program, it is important to figure out how much movement you do on a regular basis. I have a friend with a pedometer who recently discovered that he averages nine miles of walking every day. This app automatically starts tracking you when you are moving for more than a minute. You’ll be able to maintain a daily goal of 30, 60, or 90 minutes of movement. All you have to do is keep your iPhone in your pocket or bag. This app is available for free.

* Argus is an extremely powerful fitness and health tracking app, packed full of features to help you achieve your goals. It can read your heart rate, using the flash of your iPhone, track your sleep, track your activity using GPS and much more. It also has a food data bank and barcode scanner to make entering your meal information and tracking your calorie intake as easy as possible. This app is available for free.

* The most popular brand in fitness has an app for tracking movement on your iPhone. Nike’s app makes it possible for you to track when you move, how you move, and where you move. You’ll be able to set a goal and see how close you are to achieving it. Compare today’s activity with yesterday’s to see if you need to catch up. Check the graph to view a breakdown of when you ran, walked, or cycled. This app is available for free.

* Looking for support and accountability? Every aspect of this app and community has been designed with a focus on helping you achieve mastery, using the latest research on psychology and behavior. From day one, it shows you your progress, celebrates your milestones, and answers your questions. There is even content for non-fitness stuff like improving your happiness and learning new skills. This app is available for free.

* For those of you who don’t have a fancy co-processor in a newer iPhone, there are still other ways to track your daily activities. You just have to be a little more proactive about entering data. This app is full of helpful information to help you track your movement, calorie intake, and weight. The extensive food database lets you input your calories, the exercise database estimates how many calories you’ve burned, and the weight tracker helps you keep track of your goals. This app is available for free.
