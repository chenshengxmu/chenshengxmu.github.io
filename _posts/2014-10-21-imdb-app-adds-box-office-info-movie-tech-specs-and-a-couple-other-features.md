* Amazon-owned IMDb, the world’s largest collection of movie, TV and celebrity information, has a nicely done iPhone and iPad application available for free in the App Store that has just gotten a whole lot better in the latest version 4.5 release.
* For starters, the software at last provides a bunch of useful technical specifications for movies such as the original aspect ratio, color, audio, runtime and what not.
* Next, movie pages now include box office information giving you yet another indication of the movie’s popularity — that’s in addition to the previous data like review scores. Note that U.S. box office result data was previously available only via the app’s Popular Charts feature.
* If you want to write a plot for an obscure movie that lacks descriptions, or maybe add interesting trivia to a television show, you can now do so directly in the mobile app, without visiting IMDb’s interface on the web.
* The Showtimes features can switch between 24-hour or AM/PM times based on your preferences. Speaking of which, Showtimes now makes it possible to switch between your favorite places as well/
* The app’s Top 250 Movies and Trending Movie lists have been enhanced with useful icons illustrating the ways to watch a movie. Finally, title and name pages have been revamped for readability and you can now watch trailers or browse photo galleries without digging through the interface.
* IMDb 4.5 changelog:
* The team has addressed some of the most annoying bugs in this release, too. As a result, you should no longer see full-screen expanding ads more than once per day, as per iTunes release notes. Moreover, the ads won’t cover your search bar like before or crash the app.
* The 16.9-megabyte app is universal so it’ll scale nicely on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad devices as long as it’s compatible with iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
