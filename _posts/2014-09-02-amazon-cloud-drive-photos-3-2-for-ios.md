* The online retail giant Amazon on Tuesday refreshed its Cloud Drive Photos application for the iPhone and iPad with some much-needed new features.
* Used to synchronize and protect your photos and personal videos on your iOS device with Amazon’s cloud-based storage dubbed Cloud Drive, the free application now supports AirPlay, a media-streaming technology from Apple, so you can stream your photos and videos wirelessly to the big screen TV through the Apple TV box.
* Also, you can finally rename albums and easily change an album’s cover photo by swiping left/right on the album artwork. Most importantly, the app finally applies proper metadata to your photos and videos, including date taken, resolution, image type and file name.
* Here’s the complete list of changes in version 3.2:
* I’m liking the new cache options.
* Matter of fact, I tend to believe that cache management should be enforced across all third-party iOS apps, no exceptions. Software that caches content locally tends to eat up your device’s storage, posing an insurmountable problem for technically illiterate folks who mostly don’t have a clue why their iPhone has suddenly ran out of storage space.
* A good example is the otherwise excellent Dropbox for iOS app which allocates disproportionally large chunks of storage when you mark even the tiniest of files for offline access.

* Cloud Drive Photos is free to use and includes 5 gigs of free storage, with paid tiers available in 100/200/500/1,000GB increments costing $50/$100/$250/$500 per year.
