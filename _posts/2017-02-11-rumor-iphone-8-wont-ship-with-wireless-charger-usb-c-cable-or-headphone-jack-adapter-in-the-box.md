* Japanese blog Mac Otakara claimed Saturday that iPhone 8’s rumored wireless charging feature may require a dedicated wireless charger accessory that customers would need to purchase separately. Citing reliable sources within Apple’s supply chain, the story goes on to say that iPhone 8 also won’t ship with the 3.5mm headphone jack adapter found in the iPhone 7 box nor will it come with a Lightning to USB-C cable as some have hoped.
* If I’m reading the machine-translated text correctly, wireless charging on iPhone 8 should be an optional feature requiring an additional purchase of a separate accessory. That accessory is said to be based on technology from Chinese company Luxshare that has built wireless charging coils for Apple Watch’s inductive charger.
* It’s unclear how much convenience the optional wireless charger accessory might bring if it would need to be plugged into the wall, as opposed to the widely-adopted USB cord. Assuming Mac Otakara’s sources are correct, iPhone 8 will use inductive wireless charging akin to Apple Watch or Samsung’s Qi-based Fast Charge stand rather than have truly wireless long-range charging capabilities.
* The Japanese report claims that a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter will no longer come in the box alongside 2017 iPhones. Similarly, new iPhones are said to ship with a Lightning to USB-A cable rather than a Lightning to USB-C one.
* In other words, Apple’s Lightning to USB-C cable is expected to remain an optional purchase—those wishing to connect their iPhone 8 to the new MacBook Pro will need to spend extra cash on a Lightning to USB-C cable.
* The publication reiterates previous reports which called for three new iPhone models this year: the LCD-based (and mostly iterative) 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s and iPhone 7 Plus models, respectively, plus a brand new iPhone 8 device with an all-new industrial design and an OLED display measuring five inches diagonally.
* Unlike earlier reports from Nikkei and KGI Securities, sources mentioned in the Mac Otakara story are adamant that only OLED-based iPhones will in fact adopt an all-glass design with wireless charging capabilities.
