* A 19-year-old Apple fan from Hong Kong has created a very special mod for the iPhone that places Steve Jobs inside the Apple logo on the back of the device. During the initial shock of Steve’s passing, a designer created a graphic of the Apple logo with Steve Jobs’ silhouette embedded in the logo itself.
* That image became the inspiration for a very unique iPhone mod that is now available for purchase online…

* For $23.90, you can buy this back plate for your iPhone 4/4S and literally turn it into the iPhone 4-Steve. The panel is available in black and white and installation steps are provided. It’s worth noting that your iPhone will be slightly thicker after installing the mod, so know that most of your cases and similar accessories probably won’t fit anymore.
* If you want to buy this mod, you had better act fast. Stock is limited. There’s also no telling how long it will take before Apple’s team of lawyers file a cease and desist against the guy that made the mod. We think that Apple should let the mod be—it’s a beautiful tribute to Steve.

* What do you think of this iPhone mod? Will you be buying one?
