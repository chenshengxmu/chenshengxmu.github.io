* According to a new report by InsideFacebook, Facebook has recently hired Apple’s former Product Design Manager Chris Weeldreyer, as indicated by his Facebook profile. Weeldreyer, who has 8+ year experience as user interface design manager, started his new role at Facebook on June 18, 2012.
* This gig is another indication that the social networking giant could in fact be developing a phone of its own (here are the mockups)…
* Weeldreyer’s Facebook page says he worked as Apple’s UI Design Manager between November 2003 to February 2012. Prior to Apple, he had worked as Principal Designer with San Francisco, California-based Cooper from September 2000 to October 2003 and before that at Pentagram and frog design.
* Nick Bilton reported on the New York Times’ Bits blog in late-May that Facebook was poaching a bunch of former and current iPad and iPhone engineers to work on a phone project at Facebook, the social networking giant’s third take at own phone.

* 9to5Mac has more on Weeldryer’s work at Apple:
* He certainly worked on at least iWeb as he is listed as an inventor on several Apple Inc filed patents including iWeb for iPad, multi-touch and gesture related inventions, as well as a number of security related patents. His LinkedIn lists his specialties as: Industrial Design, Interaction Design, User Interface Design.
* Of course, it’s entirely possible that Facebook hired the engineer to do some interface work on Facebook’s web site or mobile apps or even streamline their design efforts across platforms.
* Be that as it may, it’s increasingly looking that Facebook could in fact be building a phone.
* What do you think, should this have Apple worried?
