* Yahoo’s Mail for iPad debuted in April of 2013 and has since been gradually picking up new features like multiple personal and Business Mail accounts, folder management, message swiping, support for Apple’s VoiceOver feature and much more.
* Today, the software has received another boost as Yahoo announced it’s bringing multiple features from the web interface to Mail for iOS, including news, search and snapshots of the weather, sports scores, stocks, popular videos and Flickr photos, now all accessible in one app…
* The app now serves stories from Yahoo’s digital magazines such as Yahoo Food, Yahoo Tech, Yahoo Travel, Yahoo Movies and Yahoo Beauty.
* This is what the new experience looks like.

* “We’ve also added snapshots of local weather, stocks, sports, popular photos, videos and more, ensuring you have all the information you care about at your fingertip,” notes Yahoo.
* It’s actually part of a bigger plan of folding Yahoo’s premium web content into its iOS apps.
* Last week, for example, the company’s main iOS app gained in-app access to these digital magazines, with snapshots of local weather, news digest, stocks, sports, popular photos and videos available within the app.
* Highlights include:
* Download Yahoo Mail free in the App Store.
* The app runs natively on any iPhone, iPod touch and iPad compatible with iOS 7.0 or later.
