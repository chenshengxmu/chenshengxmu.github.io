* So this is huge. Apple and HTC have both announced this evening that they have reached a global settlement on all patent litigation, effectively dismissing all patent-related lawsuits between the two companies. Additionally, the two handset-makers have also agreed to a 10 year cross-licensing deal for all current and future patents…
* Here’s the joint release from the two sides:
* “HTC and Apple® have reached a global settlement that includes the dismissal of all current lawsuits and a ten-year license agreement. The license extends to current and future patents held by both parties. The terms of the settlement are confidential.
* “HTC is pleased to have resolved its dispute with Apple, so HTC can focus on innovation instead of litigation,” said Peter Chou, CEO of HTC.
* “We are glad to have reached a settlement with HTC,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. “We will continue to stay laser focused on product innovation.”
* We’ve known for a while now that the two companies were in discussions to resolve their patent war. According to a court filing from Apple that surfaced back in September, it first met with HTC back on August 13 to discuss a potential resolution to their patent disputes. And a second meeting between the two happened shortly after.
* Apple’s patent war with Samsung certainly gets the most press coverage, but its battle with HTC is nothing to scoff at. The two companies were tangled in a number of lawsuits around the world as well as several ITC complaints. Last December, Apple won an ITC case against HTC here in the US that resulted in a product ban.
* Interestingly enough, HTC spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 million last summer buying S3 Graphics Co., an American-based computer graphics company, shortly after it won a patent suit against Apple involving its compression tech. Needless to say, S3 has a healthy IP portfolio, and that could have very well played a part in this deal.
* Still, the fact that the two firms have agreed to not only a settlement on current litigation, but a 10-year cross-licensing deal is huge — especially for Apple. The Cupertino-based company lodged its first patent suit against HTC, it’s first against any Android manufacturer, back in 2010 over multi-touch support.
* Either way it’s great news. And hopefully we’ll see more deals like this follow suit.
