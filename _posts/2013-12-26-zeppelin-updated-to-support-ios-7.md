* iPhone users that wish to replace AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon or another carrier logo with a custom one will be happy to hear that Zeppelin has been updated to support iOS 7. The useful tweak can be enabled or disabled from a menu in the Settings app, without a respring required, and comes with over a dozen preinstalled logos to choose from. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg… 
* The default logos that come with Zeppelin, the work of iOS developer Alex Zielenski, include the following: Abstergo, Android, Aperture Science, Apple, Assassin’s Creed, Autobots, Batman, Beats By Dre, Cloud, Dark Knight, Deceptions, Nike, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Storm Trooper, Superman, Triforce, and Windows. A large number of custom icon packs are also available on Cydia, but still need updates for iOS 7.

* Zielenski is still finalizing the new theme format for iOS 7 logos, although you can still install your own custom logos manually using iFile. Navigate to /Library/Zeppelin and add your logos in this format. If you choose to go that route, be sure to check out our custom iDownloadBlog logos for Zeppelin or even our tutorial on creating your own. The possibilities are virtually endless.
* It is important to understand that any manual changes you make to the iOS filesystem could potentially cause problems, so it is highly recommended that you always backup your device to iTunes or iCloud beforehand. Zeppelin for iOS 7 is available as a free download on Cydia by adding the repository repo.alexzielenski.com to your sources. The update should also be available soon in the ModMyi repo. Note that this tweak, like any other tweak, will not work with A7 devices.
* Be sure to share your new home screens in the comments.
