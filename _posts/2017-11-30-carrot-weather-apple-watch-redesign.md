* Your favorite weather robot now speaks to you through your Apple Watch’s speaker.
* Carrot Weather, Brian Mueller’s popular weather app for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac, today released a thoroughly revamped watch app featuring a bunch of powerful capabilities not found in any other watchOS weather app.
* Aside from the new look, Carrot Weather for Apple Watch brings rich app customization, a cool speech synthesizer, full text weather alerts, animated radar and much more.
* Speech synthesizer is perfect considering this is basically a weather robot with a personality: now you can enjoy hilarious spoken forecasts on your Apple Watch, just like on iPhone (third-party speaker access is one of the many new developer features in watchOS 4).

* The app’s watch face complications can now be customized to show cloud cover, weather alerts and the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius side by side.
* The ability to customize with the data points I care about is my basic requirement for wrist-based weather apps. On that front, the new Carrot Weather for Apple Watch delivers.

* You can customize the data points for each of the four slots using the iPhone app. Then simply double-tap the current forecast section in the watch app to show or hide the second row of data points, or swipe for even more data points.
* To track oncoming storms with animated radar, use Force Touch to choose the Radar option from the hidden menu (you can also access your Location and Settings interface from there).
* You can also read the full text of active weather alerts in your area.

* Storm tracking is a US-only feature that requires an Ultrapremium Club subscription.
* Lastly, Carrot Weather’s watch app includes improved rich notifications packed with more detail than before. For an in-depth overview of all the changes and new features in Carrot Weather 4.3, I suggest reading Ryan Christoffel’s review on MacStories.
