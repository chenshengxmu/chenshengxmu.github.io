* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game INKS. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the former Apple Design Award-winner for free on both iPhone and iPad—a solid savings of $3.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Pinball meets paintball in this gorgeous Apple Design Award winner from the team behind Lumino City. Inks ditches the stressful, not-so-fun parts of pinball, focusing instead on a breathtaking experience that’s part puzzle-solving, part artistic explosions of color. We seriously want to frame our best levels—Inks is that beautiful. 
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* INKS. is available for free in the App Store.
