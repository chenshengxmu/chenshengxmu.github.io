* It’s taken Apple about three months to do so, but it seems as if it’s finally catching up to consumer demand for the iPhone 4S. The handset has been fairly hard to come by since it launched in mid-October of last year.
* After its record-breaking debut, the iPhone 4S has had a shipping delay between one and three weeks — even over the holidays. But this week, iPhone 4S shipping times have dropped to a mere three to five days…
* Electronista reports:
* “Having been set back by at least a week for nearly all of the smartphone’s existence, orders for AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon models now take three to five days to ship regardless of the capacity. Individual carriers make it more difficult to gauge demand, although Verizon is showing a delay only on the white 32GB.”
* This is great news for anyone in the US who has been struggling to get their hands on an iPhone 4S. It appears that Apple has pushed past whatever manufacturing problem that was causing the extended wait times.
* But even with the 4S shipping delays, Apple is expected to have sold over 30 million iPhones this quarter for the first time in its history. We’ll know more exact numbers after the company releases its quarterly earnings report later this month.
