* The long-awaited iOS 6.x jailbreak, known as evasi0n, has been dubbed the most popular jailbreak ever. And rightly so. In its first 10 minutes, it was used by over 100,000 people. And 4 days later, that number grew to 7 million.
* Today, nearly a month after evasi0n’s release, there’s a new statistic out. Evad3rs team member pod2g just passed along the news from Saurik that more than 14 million devices have now been seen running Cydia on iOS 6.x…
* Here’s the tweet:
* New statistic from @saurik: 14,051,500 unique devices have been seen running Cydia on iOS 6.x! 14 millions! and 23 millions any version.

* Obviously, there’s no way of verifying how many of these devices were jailbroken using evasi0n (other tools like RedSn0w and Sn0wbreeze are technically capable), but we’re willing to bet that it’s an extremely large portion.
* Apple released iOS 6 to the public in September of last year, and there were a good 3 or 4 months after that where we didn’t hear a word about its jailbreak status. Some people even started losing hope. But then came the evad3rs.
* As most of you know by now, evasi0n is the product of the evad3rs, a team made up of iOS hackers MuscleNerd, pod2g, planetbeing and pimskeks. The hack is extremely complex, and has managed to survive 2 iOS updates.
* But unfortunately, it looks like its run is over. Last week, planetbeing confirmed that Apple has already patched at least one of the exploits evasi0n uses in iOS 6.1.3, effectively breaking the jailbreak. We still need more details though.
* If for some reason you haven’t used it yet, you can find evasi0n on our Downloads page. And if you’re not sure how to use it, or just need a refresher, feel free to check out our evasi0n tutorial for Mac, or our evasi0n guide for Windows.
