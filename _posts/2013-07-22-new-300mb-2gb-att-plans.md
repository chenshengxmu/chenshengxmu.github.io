* AT&T has introduced two new Mobile Share plans this morning, rounding out its family of Mobile Share rate options it first introduced in the summer of last year. The offerings are designed to allow users to share monthly data allotments across multiple devices.
* Previously, the plans started at 1GB of data per month and then jumped straight to 4GB. But today, AT&T announced that it would be adding 300MB and 2GB plans to the mix, giving users that don’t require much data a wider selection of options to choose from…
* From the carrier’s press release:
* “With the launch of two new Mobile Share plans, AT&T* continues to make it easy and affordable for customers to share data on the nation’s fastest and now most reliable 4G LTE network**. Available July 26, new and existing customers will have two new Mobile Share plan options to choose from — 300 MB or 2 GB of data with unlimited talk and text.
* The 300 MB plan is only $20 a month, with additional costs per device added. Now, customers with basic and quick-messaging devices can share data and unlimited talk and text for as low as $50 a month and smartphone customers for $70 a month. The new 2 GB plan provides another choice for customers whose data needs exceed our existing 1 GB plan available today.”
* And here’s a breakdown of the costs:

* The introduction of these new plans comes hot on the heels of AT&T taking some criticism over its new Next device upgrade program. Multiple comparisons of Next with similar Jump and Edge programs from T-Mobile and Verizon find it to be significantly more expensive.
* I don’t think these new plans will appease any of those upset customers, but it could at least lower the monthly expenses for folks who were pay for a 1GB plan or a 4GB plan, but didn’t need it. As mentioned above, these new options will be available starting on July 26.
