* The Electra Team delivered on their promise to release an iOS 11.2-11.3.1 jailbreak on Friday, and you can now download Electra1131 from the team’s official website to pwn your device.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to jailbreak iOS 11.2-11.3.1 using Electra1131. When you’re ready to move forward with the jailbreak process, simply follow these steps:
* 1) Download the most recent version of Electra1131 from the Electra Team’s official website.
* Note: Make sure to choose the non-developer [vfs] version if you aren’t a registered Apple developer; otherwise, developers can download the developer [multipath tcp] version.
* 2) Download Cydia Impactor on your computer and launch it.
* 3) Connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer with an MFi-certified Lightning cable.
* Note: Cydia Impactor should recognize your device as shown in the screenshot. If it does not, make sure to “Trust” your computer from your device via the pop-up, and vice-versa.
* 4) Click and drag the Electra1131.ipa file over the Cydia Impactor window like so:

* 5) Sign in with your Apple ID when prompted:

* Note: Before proceeding to the next step, CoolStar recommends enabling Airplane Mode, disabling your passcode/Touch ID/Face ID, disabling Siri, and rebooting your device. Taking these additional steps isn’t mandatory, but seems to increase the tool’s success rate.
* 9) After taking the recommended steps above to prepare your device, tap on the Electra icon from your Home screen and then tap on the Jailbreak button in the app:

* Note: The tool will begin jailbreaking your device. It should respring afterward.
* 10) After respringing, you should find Cydia on your Home screen. Viola:

* Note: If you don’t see Cydia after jailbreaking with Electra1131, then re-launch the Electra jailbreak app and keep trying until it does (it took me 3 tries).
* And that’s all there is to it; you’ve successfully jailbroken your iOS 11.2-11.3.1 device!
