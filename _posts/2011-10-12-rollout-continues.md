* Apple is in the middle of one of its busiest weeks in recent memory. It’s releasing multiple major software updates, including iOS 5, and it’s launching a major sync and storage service. Oh, and it has to deliver a million iPhone 4S orders by Friday.
* Apple kickstarted the festivities yesterday afternoon by rolling out iTunes 10.5. Now the company has moved on to iCloud, giving the service’s website a noticeable update. Along with a new login screen (above), iCloud.com also lost its ‘beta’ status… 
* For those who aren’t familiar, iCloud.com is the web portal for Apple’s new iCloud service. This enables you to access iCloud-synced information like contacts, calendar, and even email from a web browser anywhere in the world.
* Though the website has been updated, and is no longer marked as beta, it may still not work for folks on non-developer accounts. iCloud itself has not gone live to the public yet, so there’s a good chance that the website is the same way.
* Things are definitely getting interesting, though. First iTunes, now iCloud.com, and iOS 5 should be released sometime this afternoon. Make sure to keep checking back with us throughout the day for the latest updates on Apple’s releases.
