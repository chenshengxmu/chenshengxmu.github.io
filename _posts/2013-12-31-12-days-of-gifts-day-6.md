* We are now on day 6 of the big 12 Days of Gifts event, meaning the company has removed the Hugo movie and has posted a new free item for download. Today’s gift is the song ‘New Year’s Eve Mix’ by popular Swedish producer Avicii.
* It’s been a huge year for Avicii, who has been topping charts around the globe with his latest album True. And New Year’s Eve Mix is a 9-minute track that features a mashup of some of his hit songs from that album such as ‘Hey Brother.’

* From the iTunes description of Avicii’s True album:
* “When Avicii unveiled a full folk band to perform the bluegrass-tinted cut “Wake Me Up” featuring Aloe Blacc at a massive Miami gig, the song was met with skepticism. But as the single raced up international pop charts and set the tone for his earnest and idealistic second album, True, Avicii was vindicated. To simply call him a DJ, a producer, or a remixer would be a misnomer; he’s actually a pop composer, commanding huge, unabashedly uplifting melodies set to mainstream dance tracks, with nary a sample or interpolation in sight.”
* Today’s free gift includes what appears to be a music video of Avicii’s hit song You Make Me, and then the aforementioned 9+ minute medley of the same song mashed up with Hey Brother and I Could Be the One—both of which were hits.
* Remember that these gifts typically vary depending on your region, and they’re only available for 24 hours. So if you live in the US (and Canada?), make sure you’ve downloaded the 12 Days of Gifts app so you can grab the free track.
