* Now that he’s finished up his staggering ‘iPad Air’ announcement, Apple’s Phil Schiller has turned his focus to the smaller iPad mini. It too is getting a big refresh today, with the long-awaited display bump.
* As expected, Apple has managed to squeeze its Retina screen in the tiny tablet, giving it the same 2048 x 1536 resolution as its larger sibling. And it’s also added its 64-bit A7 processor, and other goodies…

* With the new hardware, Apple says the second generation mini is up to 4x faster on CPU and 8x faster on the graphics. It also features 2x faster Wi-Fi, expanded LTE support, and the same 10-hour battery life.
* The new iPad mini will come in 16GB, 32GB, 64GB and 128GB flavors, starting at the [more expensive] price of $399 for the Wi-Fi only model. Interestingly enough, Apple just says ‘November’ for availability.
* Apple will be keeping the first gen iPad mini around, though, and has slashed its price to $299.
