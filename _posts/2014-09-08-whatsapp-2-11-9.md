* Facebook-owned WhatsApp this morning received a substantial update, bringing out a slew of new features to the popular messaging and soon-to-be VoIP platform.
* Available as a free download for the iPhone, the new WhatsApp version 2.11.9 now makes it a lot easier to capture and send photos with a new fast camera access button in the interface.
* Moreover, the refreshed software lets you archive chats and groups, add captions to media and share iPhone 5s-only Slow-Mo videos at 120 frames per second while introducing new location-sharing features, wallpapers, notification tones, media auto-download preferences in settings and more.
* WhatsApp 2.11.9 changelog:
* The 49.7-megabyte download requires an iPhone running iOS 4.3 or later.
* [App Store]
