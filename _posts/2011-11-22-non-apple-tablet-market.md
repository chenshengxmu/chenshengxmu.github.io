* To say that Apple dominates the tablet market would be an understatement. The iPad has been successful enough to not only run other companies out of the tablet-making business, but it has also been enough to make even PC manufacturers nervous.
* We’ve seen statistics before regarding Apple’s share of the tablet market, but we had no idea the numbers were this bleak for the competition. According to a recent NPD Group report, there has only been 1.2 million non-iPad tablets sold in the United States this year…
* That’s staggering when you consider that Apple sold over 11 million iPads last quarter. Sure, that number comes from total global sales, but it also comes from just a three month period. The aforementioned number of US-based tablet sales was over a 10 month span. Ouch.
* NPD’s research also revealed some other interesting facts. Apparently, HP sold the most non-iPad tablets in the US this year. That probably has something to do with the $99 fire sale it hosted a few months ago that reportedly cost the company over a billion dollars.

* Right behind HP was Samsung, who has been in the tablet game longer than everyone but Apple. In fact, the Galaxy Tab is the reason behind several Apple-lead lawsuits against the Korean company.
* The tablet market landscape is quickly changing. Companies like Barnes and Noble and Amazon have recently released low-cost, capable slates that could draw in a lot of consumers during this economic slump. It’ll be interesting to see what these numbers look like a year from now.
