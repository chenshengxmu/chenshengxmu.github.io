* The Wallpapers of the Week section continues with geometric images. This category has been popular over the course of our wallpaper section and today bolsters the collection. Geometric wallpapers add a flash of color and texture to iPhone’s Lock and Home screens. With iOS 7+ these images can drastically change the look of your device because the opacity changes drastically across the UI. In addition to grabbing some fresh new versions, inside is also a back catalogue of previous posts that include similarly tailored options.
