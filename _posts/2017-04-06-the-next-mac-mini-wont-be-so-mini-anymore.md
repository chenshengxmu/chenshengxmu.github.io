* Apple’s most affordable Mac starts at just $499. Described as a BYODKM desktop computer (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard and Mouse), it’s just an inch and a half tall and weighs 2.6 pounds.
* They’re calling it Mac mini and it comes with four USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, HDMI video output, Gigabit Ethernet, an SD card slot and more.
* The next Mac mini “won’t be so mini anymore.”
* That’s according to a source, cited by the Pike’s Universe blog, that’s usually “pretty accurate”. The comment suggests that Apple’s next flagship Mac mini model could feature a taller chassis in order to accommodate for more powerful hardware.
* Intel in January 2017 unveiled faster Kaby Lake processors  suitable for Mac mini.
* If you ask us, a next-gen Mac mini should adopt Kaby Lake, the faster Thunderbolt 3 standard, USB-C, more powerful graphics, speedier RAM, power-sipping Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology (existing models have Bluetooth 4.0) and other perks.
* The current-generation Mac mini is available in three models:
* The $499 and $699 models can be configured with Fusion Drive, which integrates a traditional one-terabyte hard drive with 128 gigabytes of fast PCIe-based flash storage for both speed and capacity. The $699 model is upgradeable to a 3.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5 GHz for an extra $300.
* The top-of-the-line $999 model can be outfitted with a 3.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with 256GB/512GB/1TB flash storage upgrades available as well. All models can be upgraded to sixteen gigabytes of 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM.

* Make no mistake, these machines are way overdue for a refresh. Mac mini was last updated in October 2014—that’s a whopping 903 days since the computer’s last release, which in this industry feels like an eternity.
* Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, told BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski that Mac mini is still important to them:
* I’ll say the Mac mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use. Mac mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today.
* Pike’s Universum also said that the next macOS version won’t have a mountain or park name and claimed that Apple’s upcoming external display for a “completely rethought” Mac Pro will have an impressive 8K resolution.
* Lastly, the blog shared claimed tech specs for the new iMacs that are coming down the pike later this year. The upcoming all-in-one desktops should ship with Intel’s faster Xeon E3 chips, ECC RAM up to 64 gigabytes, Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and more.
