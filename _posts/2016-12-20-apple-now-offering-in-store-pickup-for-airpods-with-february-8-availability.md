* As first noted by AppleInsider, Apple yesterday began offering the in-store pickup option for its newly launched AirPods wireless earphones. Apple.com online store in the United States indicated at post time that first AirPods ordered with the in-store pickup option would be available on February 8.
* If you choose to have AirPods shipped to your home, they’re estimated to arrive in six weeks.
* Note that estimated delivery dates can change depending on stock, demand, manufacturing issues and other conditions. Following their unexpected delay, AirPods finally began shipping to customers just days before Christmas.
* What limited inventory was available at Apple stores sold out quickly.
* To check availability of the in-store pickup option for AirPods, visit the AirPods webpage. Click the blue Buy button in the top-right corner, then hit the “Check Availability” link underneath the Pickup heading in the lefthand column.

* Now select your favorite Apple Store from the list, or type its name in the search filed to check availability. Choose a desired store, then add AirPods to your shopping bag and proceed to checkout.
* Most of the stores list AirPods as arriving on February 8, 2017 for in-store pickup.
* You’ll receive a notification email when your order is ready to be picked up. You can pick up the order yourself or have someone else pick it up for you.
