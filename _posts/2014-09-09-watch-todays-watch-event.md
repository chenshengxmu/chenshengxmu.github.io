* Folks who missed Apple’s keynote this morning, or would just like to watch it in its entirety, will be happy to hear that Apple has just posted the full video online for your streaming pleasure. Obviously, you can read everything you need to know about today’s event right here on iDB. But if you have the time, the video is definitely worth watching.
* The event doesn’t appear to be available on YouTube yet, so we can’t embed it here, but we will be sure to do so once it gets posted. For those who would like to watch the clip now, however, you can find it on Apple’s website. Just make sure you have QuickTime installed, or a similar media player that supports QT files.
