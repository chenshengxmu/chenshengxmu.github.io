* Anyone with an iPhone 6s or later can access handy 3D Touch-based app features directly from their Home screen without launching the said app, but those with older devices haven’t been as lucky (until now).
* A new free jailbreak tweak called Force3DAppShortcuts by iOS developer DGh0st lets you access the same Home screen-based Quick Action menus that you could typically only access on a 3D Touch-enabled device.
* Once installed, you can tap and hold on any app icon from your Home screen to access that app’s Quick Actions, as shown above. It’s a lot like having 3D Touch support on a non-supported device, but it only works from the Home screen and not everywhere else in iOS.
* Notably, all the menu options mirror those that you’d see on a stock 3D Touch-supported device, and they work just as you’d expect them to. That said, Force3DAppShortcuts is a lot like having native 3D Touch on your device.
* Force3DAppShortcuts adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure a few options to your liking:

* Among the things you can do here are:
* A respring button just below the tweak’s kill switch lets you save any changes you make to these settings at any time.
* Because the tweak replaces the gesture used for deleting or moving apps on your Home screen, it’s great how the developer includes a new way to manage your app icons apart from the 3D Touch gesture simulation. We also like that there’s haptic feedback built-in, as it makes the entire experience feel more like the real thing on an iPhone 6s or newer.
* If you’d like to give Force3DAppShortcuts a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak currently works with all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
