* Although Apple’s Siri uses Nuance’s speech recognition technology, the digital assistant may be getting a new voice soon. Although Nuance continues to power Siri’s speech recognition, a number of former Nuance employees reportedly are now part of Apple’s in-house efforts to develop a new speech recognition technology to power Siri, reducing its technological dependency on third-parties.
* For instance, a number of former employees of VoiceSignal Technologies, a speech software firmed acquired by Nuance, now appear in leading roles developing Siri as an in-house application for Apple, according to a Friday report…
* According to Xconomy, leading the Apple team is Gunnar Evermann as Manager, Siri Speech. Evermann moved from Apple’s California headquarter to Boston, opening the firm’s office.
* Furthermore, Nuance’s former vice president of research, Larry Gillick, is now listed by Apple as “chief speech scientist, Siri,” according to the report.
* The crux of the report:
* Apple has assembled a small team of notable names in speech technology and is looking to expand those efforts in the Boston area, industry sources tell Xconomy.
* Based on their online job profiles, we can say that members of the Apple speech team here are working on Siri, the company’s voice-activated virtual assistant. Details beyond that are hard to come by, however, even for others in the field.
* Don McAllaster, is reportedly Siri’s senior research scientist. He worked with Gillick when both were at Dragon Systems, another speech firm.
* “By opening its own speech-technology office here – stocked with former Nuance employees, no less – Apple could be signaling a move away from relying on Nuance for Siri’s guts,” writes Xconomy reporter Curt Woodward.
* Although Apple usually does little development outside its California home base, the firm is noted for its desire to retain key technology in-house.
* The most recent example of keeping key components Apple-only was the much-publicized rejection of Google Maps for Apple Maps, then the equally-public reversal, permitting Google’s mapping service back in the form of a downloadable App Store app.
* Such a move to replace Nuance also makes sense after Apple CEO Tim Cook called iOS-enabled cars ‘key’ to his company’s future. In-dash versions of Siri have become an integral part of that future, as well.
* However, the most potent reason for Apple to cut ties with Nuance might be because the Boston-based company also supplies speech technology to rival Samsung.
