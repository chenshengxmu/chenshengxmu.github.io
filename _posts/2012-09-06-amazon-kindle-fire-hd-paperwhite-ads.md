* Amazon just wrapped up its news-packed event that saw the company update its Kindle lineup and add two new notable products to the mix: the Kindle Paperwhite with a stunning new display combining the best of LCD and e-ink technology and the Kindle Fire HD, a tablet meant to take Apple’s iPad on the high-end.
* You should care because Amazon has the ecosystem, the game plan and the devices to take on Apple from every angle. If you don’t have time to read through our extensive coverage of Amazon’s presser, have a look at two new ads that highlight headline features of the two new tablets…
* Here, the commercial promoting the Kindle Paperwhite device with its revolutionary new display technology that even managed to impress Gizmodo.

* Amazon nailed it, if you ask me.
* They are really developing rapidly as a technology giant to form Eric Schmidt’s “gang of four” alongside Apple, Google and Microsoft.
* Right now, no other company has as comprehensive a lineup of tablets as them (your competitive specs mega-matrix is right here).
* Analyst Michael Gartenberg is on the same page, writing on Twitter that “Amazon opened up a big can of whoop-ass on Android tablets today”.
* Not everyone agrees, of course, but it’s noteworthy that even the Apple pundit John Gruber praised Amazon’s presser on his Daring Fireball blog, writing:
* Now this is how you do a product announcement event: product demos, prices, ship dates. Really impressive stuff at extremely aggressive prices.
* Couldn’t have said it better.
* Are you sold yet?
