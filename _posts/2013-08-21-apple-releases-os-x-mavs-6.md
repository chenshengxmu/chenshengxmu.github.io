* Apple has seeded the 6th developer preview of OS X Mavericks this afternoon. The download comes exactly two weeks after developer preview 5 dropped, which added both the Mac iBooks app and a new version of iPhoto beta.
* The newest Mavericks preview comes alongside the final build of OS X 10.8.5, and is now available for download in either the Mac App Store, as a software update, or through Apple’s Mac Dev Center, to all registered developers…
* Apple introduced Mavericks, its next generation desktop OS, at WWDC in June. It will be available to the public this fall, bringing along a number of new features including Maps and iBooks apps, Safari improvements, and much more.
* We’re installing developer preview 6 on our machines now, and will be sure to update this post with any notable changes we come across. Stay tuned!
