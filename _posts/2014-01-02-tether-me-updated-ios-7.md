* Good news this afternoon for jailbreakers: another popular tweak has been updated to support iOS 7 and A7 processors. That tweak is called TetherMe, and it allows you to—you guessed it—tether your cellular iOS device to a non-cellular device.
* Though it’s not mentioned nearly as often as MyWi, its functions are very similar and it’s much less expensive. Users can choose to share their iPhone’s Internet access with other devices over USB, Bluetooth, or via your standard Wi-Fi hotspot…
* Tetherme 3.0.x is out on Cydia. Works on ios7 & 64bit. Works great with iphone5s. Thanks @sbingner. Btw it’s settings,cellular,hotspot to on

* Here’s the tweak’s description from Cydia:
* “Dynamically enables native tethering or personal hotspot for iOS3.X or newer devices. This should work on any carrier without the need for customized bundles or preferences.
* TetherMe has been tested to work on all iOS versions from 3.0 to 6.1 (now 7) and works by telling the iPhone to allow tethering on any APN that is used for iPhone data. As a result, you should not be charged any more for tethering data than normal data by your phone company as all tethering data appears to come from the iPhone itself.”
* There’s no icon for this tweak. So once installed, you’ll have to visit the TetherMe pane in your Settings app. From there, you’ll be able to select which method you want to use to tether your device with others, as well as view their respective options.
* This tweak should work on every provider without additional user interaction. However, should you get caught tethering without your carrier’s permission, remember that it’s very possible they could force you to change your plan or charge you fees.
* If you’re interested, you can find the updated TetherMe in Cydia, in the BigBoss repo, for $4.99.
