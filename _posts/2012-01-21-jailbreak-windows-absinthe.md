* Alright all of you Windows users, as promised, the Chronic Dev Team has just released a Windows version of its new jailbreak utility, Absinthe. The software works on both the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2.
* The program is pretty straight-forward. So if you’re a veteran jailbreaker, feel free to grab Absinthe from our Downloads page and get started. But for those looking for help, here’s an easy to follow step-by-step tutorial…
* Before we get started, you’ll need to make sure that your iPad 2 is on iOS 5.0.1 (iPhone 4S users can be on 5.0 or 5.0.1). You can find that out by going to Settings > General > About. It should say what firmware your on under Version.
* Now onto the jailbreaking!
* Step 1. Grab Absinthe for Windows from our Downloads page. Once it’s finished downloading, unzip the file and then open it as an administrator.

* Step 2. Connect your iPhone 4S or iPad 2 to your computer via its USB cable.
* Step 3. Once Absinthe has recognized that there is a device connected to your computer, click the Jailbreak button.

* Step 4. After the program is done running (and not a second before), go to your device’s home screen and locate the Absinthe icon. Click it. This executes the final stage of the jailbreak.

* Step 5. Once that’s finished, your device should restart itself. And you should notice that the Cydia icon has replaced the Absinthe one. Enjoy.
* If you get the “Error Establishing Database Connection” error, don’t worry, we have a fix for that. We also have a list of some common jailbreak issues, and how to solve them. Otherwise, you shouldn’t run into any problems.
* Once your device is jailbroken, be sure to check our some of our favorite Cydia packages. We have a list of the best ones for both the iPad and the iPhone, and even have some cool Siri tweaks for the iPhone 4S.
