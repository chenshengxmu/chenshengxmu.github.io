* Apple isn’t planning to release iOS 12 to the masses until sometime this Fall, but that hasn’t stopped renowned security researcher Liang Chen of KeenLab from flexing his digital muscles.
* Chen shared the following video this weekend from his Twitter account that depicts a working jailbreak on an iPhone X running iOS 12 beta 1:
* The video encompasses the typical proof-of-concept steps intended to prove that it’s a legitimate installation of iOS 12, such as going into Settings → Software Update and Settings → About.
* Upon validating his point, Chen launches a proprietary KeenLab jailbreak app and taps on the “Jailbreak” button within. Within moments, the app exploits the device and installs Cydia.
* Chen is witnessed launching Cydia and demonstrating its working condition afterward.
* Notably, this is the first iOS 12-centric jailbreak demonstration since Apple announced the new firmware update at WWDC 2018 a couple of weeks ago.
* But as exciting as this may seem at first glance, you shouldn’t expect a public release. The KeenLab team usually keeps their jailbreaks to themselves for internal testing purposes only.
* If anything, Chen’s demo video serves as a proof of concept and illustrates how Apple’s newest firmware can still be jailbroken despite efforts made by the company to thwart the community.
* Would you like to be able to jailbreak iOS 12 when it comes out? Share in the comments section below.
