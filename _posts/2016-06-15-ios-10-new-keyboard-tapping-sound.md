* Aside from the headlining new features, including a revamped Lock screen, a vastly improved Messages, a lot smarter Maps and more, iOS 10 sports a bunch of refinements that make for a more pleasing experience overall.
* One of those tidbits is an all-new tapping sound when using the stock keyboard on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. Here’s what it sounds like.
* Check out the video below for the new keyboard tapping sound.
* Though it’s a subtle change, the clicking sound will instantly feel new to users who’ve grown accustomed to the traditional sound of pressing keys on the iPhone’s keyboard, which hasn’t changed since the iPhone’s inception.
* For those wondering, as much as I poked around in Settings I couldn’t find the option to customize the keyboard sound.
* Are you in approval of iOS 10’s new keyboard clicking sound?
* At first, I thought it sounded weird, but then I got used to it in no time.
