* It seems like AT&T is determined to keep its promise of adding 80 new LTE markets by the end of summer. Last week it lit up the high-speed service in 10 new markets, and this week it’s activated it in another 16.
* The latest rollout includes a number of major cities across the US such as Colorado Springs, Colorado; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Olympia, Washington. As usual, we have the full list of new markets after the fold…
* Newly added LTE markets:
* In addition to the new markets, AT&T also expanded LTE coverage in Jonesboro, Arkansas; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and York, Pennsylvania. Subscribers in these areas, it says, should now be seeing the 4G network.
* Speaking of 4G networks, AT&T claims its LTE service now covers “200 million people.” That puts them in a distant second to Verizon, who has LTE in over 400 markets, and way ahead of Sprint, who just has 90.
* I will say that AT&T’s LTE is extremely fast though. It just recently went live in my city, and I’ve been seeing consistent download speeds in the high 20MB-low 30MB range—more than twice as fast as my Verizon phone.
