* Good news for the folks up in Alaska. The brand new Alaska Apple Store will be opening its doors to the cold air this Saturday at the 5th Avenue mall in Anchorage.
* Although this might not be that exciting of news for the rest of us, it’s still great to see that Apple is continuously expanding with an additional 4 store openings this Saturday…
* In addition to the Anchorage store, Apple will also open stores in Utah, Australia, Canada, and Italy over the weekend.
* It’s hard to believe that despite its grand success in the US, Apple still doesn’t have stores in 7 states: Arkansas, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
* I’m sure in the near future those states will get a store, but until then they will have to use Apple online store to get their fix.
* So if you’re in the Anchorage area this Saturday and sick of getting your Apple products through airmail, swing on by the 5th Avenue mall starting at 10am.
