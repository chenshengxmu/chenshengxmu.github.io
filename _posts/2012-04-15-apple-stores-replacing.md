* 9to5Mac is reporting this weekend that Apple is experiencing “atypical inventory shortages” of white 16GB iPhone 4 replacement units. As a result, it seems like [at least] some iPhone 4 users seeking hardware replacements could be in for a nice surprise.
* According to the report, Apple has instructed some of its Apple Store Genius Bars to start replacing problematic white 16GB iPhone 4 models with compatible iPhone 4S units…
* “This iPhone 4S would be a refurbished white iphone 4S 16GB. This situation will not affect all customers and Apple Stores, but it seems like many white iPhone 4 16GB owners seeking hardware replacements may get Siri, an A5 chip, and an eight megapixel camera out of their next Genius Bar appointment.”
* It’s worth noting that this exception only applies to white 16GB iPhone 4 models that are still under their AppleCare warranties. And at this point, only Apple Stores in Canada and the United States appear to be making the exchanges.
* But if you meet the above-criteria, and your iPhone 4 has been acting up, it seems like there’s a fair chance that Apple will replace it with a 4S model. Cool.
* Have you received a 4S replacement for your iPhone 4?
