* Our friends over at MacRumors did it again. Remember a recent iLoungue report describing a taller iPhone rocking a four-inch display that Apple may or may not have been prototyping for some time?
* Tapping proven design talent of Federico Ciccarese, the publication published a pair of gorgeous-looking renditions depicting such a device sitting next to an everyday 3.5-inch iPhone 4S.
* I wasn’t sure about a larger iPhone, but have definitely changed my mind having seen this image. Also, if you use a WebGL-based browser such as Safari on OS X or Google’s Chrome, you can play with an interactive 3D model of the mockup…
* Blowing up a 3.5-inch display on the iPhone 4S to four inches in diagonal while maintaining the same width would add approximately 11 mm, or 0.45 inch, to the height of the display.
* And what do you think the extra space could be used for?
* According to MacRumors:
* As had been proposed in earlier speculation, a taller display could allow Apple to add one more row of icons to the iPhone’s home screen, moving to five rows per page plus the row of pinned icons in the dock at the bottom of the screen.
* Here, another shot:

* iLounge called for a 10mm taller iPhone body compared to the iPhone 4S, which measures in at 115.2 mm.
* If you can’t get enough of this mockup, why not rotate an interactive 3D model around using a WebGL-based browser such as Google’s Chrome or Apple’s Safari on OS X?
* WebGL is disabled by default in Safari on OS X so you’ll have to enable it first by navigating to Preferences -> Advanced -> Show Develop in menu bar and then choose the “Enable WebGL” option under the Develop menu.
* What did you think of this artist’s rendition?
