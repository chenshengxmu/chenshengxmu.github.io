* That big Starbucks app update we told you about last week has arrived in the App Store today. The update, which brings the client to version 3.o, includes the long-awaited redesign for iOS 7 as well as a handful of major new features and improvements.
* On the new features side, we have shake-to-pay, which will allow you to bring up your barcode with the flick of a wrist to pay for your Starbucks order. There’s also a new digital tipping function that lets you tip your barista, and a new Dashboard view…
* From the 3.0 release notes:
* The official iPhone application from Starbucks has been completely redesigned, bringing you an improved interface, a more personal dashboard experience, digital tipping and other great features. 
* • Digital Tipping (U.S. company-operated stores): You’re welcome to tip your barista up two hours after your purchase. You’ll receive a push notification after each eligible transaction.  • Dashboard: See your rewards level, available rewards, inbox messages and most recent transactions. • Shake-to-Pay: For added convenience, simply shake your device to show the barcode to pay at the register.  • Share Rewards Milestones: Reached Gold Level? Spread the word on Facebook and Twitter.  • Integrated History: View your entire account history—including purchases made, Stars earned and rewards redeemed—in a single feed. 
* For those who have never used the Starbucks app before, it’s perhaps one of the most functional mobile apps for a food/drink chain available. You can use it to pay for your order, track your rewards and card balances, send gifts, receive offers and locate stores.

* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of the Starbucks app in the App Store for free (if you don’t see 3.0 right away, give it a sec as it still seems to be rolling out). It’s for the iPhone only, and note you will need to re-login to your account after updating.
