* Whether charging your iPhone 6, syncing it with iTunes, or simply gazing longingly into its front-facing camera, you may be in the market for a stand to display your device with. The Sinjimoru Aluminum SyncStand is a sturdy holder for your iPhone 6 that has a sleek design to compliment your Apple product. You don’t have to worry about whether this stand is MFi compatible since you use your own cable for syncing and charging.
* The rounded aluminum base looks like it could double as a bangle bracelet at a futuristic dinner party. It has two feet at the bottom with rubberized strips across the bottom. The inner lining is rubberized with slight protrusions on either end, so you won’t have to worry about scratches when you rest your smartphone against it.
* The mount for the stand is detachable. You can add or remove the cable adaptors to fit different versions of iPhone, as well as non-Apple smartphones like Samsung’s Galaxy line. It is also sturdy enough to hold an iPad mini in place.
* The cradle is specially designed to make it easy for you to switch from portrait mode while charging to landscape mode for watching movies. Although, you won’t be able to connect your iPhone 6 while it is in landscape mode.
* The cable protrudes out of the mount enough for you to be able to plug your iPhone in with a case that is 2mm or thinner.
* It comes in black or silver aluminum and is available on Amazon for $20, where it is getting a fairly good rating at four stars out of about 175 reviews. You can also order one with a non-MFi Lightning cable for three dollars more.
