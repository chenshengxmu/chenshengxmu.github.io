* HomePod runs a custom-made version of the iOS mobile operating system.
* You can easily confirm the version number of the iOS software that’s running on your HomePod, which may come in handy when a new firmware becomes available for the device.
* Likewise, knowing the serial number for your HomePod is essential when you register your Siri-driven speaker with Apple or in case you need support.
* TUTORIAL: How to set up your new HomePod
* Before we get to the meat of the post, it’s worth reiterating that you should make sure that your iOS device is signed in with the same Apple ID that you used to set up the speaker.
* You can find your HomePod’s serial numbers in the Home app or the Settings app on the iOS device used to set up your new speaker. It’s also printed at the bottom of the device.
* To verify the serial number for your HomePod in the Home app on your iOS device:
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 2) Tap the Home tab.
* 3) Press and hold the icon for your HomePod with 3D Touch (or long-press if you have an iOS device without 3D Touch), then hit the Details option.
