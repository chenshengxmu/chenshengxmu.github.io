* TweetSong is a jailbreak tweak for iOS 5 that makes it easy to tweet out your #nowplaying song using iOS 5’s built in Twitter integration.
* It works by assigning an Activator action to pull in the current playing song from your music app, placing it conveniently into the body of your tweet.
* If you’re curious to see TweetSong in action, check out our video walkthrough inside…
* As you might expect, TweetSong does have limitations. It’s currently limited to only tweet out the tunes playing by means of the stock Music app. That means that it won’t pick up on music that you’re playing by other means like Spotify or Rdio.
* Nevertheless, TweetSong is a excellent tweak to have if you have a large library of songs stored locally on your device, or via iTunes Match.
* If your device is jailbroken, you can download TweetSong for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* How do you like it?
