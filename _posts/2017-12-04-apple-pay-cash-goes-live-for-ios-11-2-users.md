* Yesterday’s release of iOS 11.2 brought support for Apple Pay Cash, the new person-to-person mobile payment solution from Apple based on Apple Pay.
* However, the Apple Pay Cash backed was not turned on at the time of iOS 11.2 release, meaning users who updated to it didn’t see the Apple Pay Cash option in the Wallet app.
* Apple has promised to bring Apple Pay Cash servers online this week, and now multiple iOS 11.2 users are reporting on Twitter and elsewhere being able to set up and use the service. We have confirmed that many users are now being able to use the service.
* Apple Pay Cash is available only in the United States. It’s a staggered rollout so not everyone was able to use the feature at post time. If you live in the United States but cannot set up Apple Pay Cash yet, try again in a few hours.
* Take a look at the Apple Pay Cash setup process, how it works and what you can do with it.

* With Apple Pay Cash, you can send, request and receive money from friends and family with Apple Pay in Messages or by asking Siri. You can keep the money you receive this way, spend it at retailers that accept Apple Pay or withdraw funds to your bank account.
* Apple Pay Cash will hit Apple Watch with the public release of watchOS 4.2
