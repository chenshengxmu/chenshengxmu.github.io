* While Tim Cook was speaking over at The Wall Street Journal’s inaugural WSJ.D Live conference, T-Mobile CEO John Legere joined Ina Fried on stage at Recode’s Code/Mobile event earlier this evening. During the interview, the outspoken executive covered a range of interesting topics.
* Among those topics was iPhone 6 demand. Legere said that the debut of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was T-Mobile’s biggest phone launch in company history. He also noted that demand for the larger 6 Plus has been “mind blowing,” accounting for nearly 50% of iPhone 6 mix at one point.
* Here are a few notable highlights from the interview:
* Just before the interview, John Legere and T-Mobile announced their earnings for the September quarter. The carrier posted a surprising net profit loss for the three month period, but added 2.3 million customers (1.4 million  postpaid), making it the biggest growth quarter in company history.
