* Mobile Terminal is an extremely handy tool to have if you’re used to using a command line interface.
* Unfortunately, the version that’s still in Cydia has gone without an update for quite some time now, rendering it unusable on recent iOS firmware.
* With this handy video tutorial, I’ll show you how to get back in the game with Mobile Terminal on iOS 5…
* You will need to be jailbroken in order to install any instance of Mobile Terminal. It also helps if you have iFile as well.
* Step 1: Verify that you have CoreUtilities installed in Cydia. If not, you will receive a dependency error when trying to install Mobile Terminal. To verify, open Cydia and tap the Manage tab. In the upper left-hand corner tap the Settings button. Select Hacker Mode and tap done. Tap the Search tab, and search for “coreutils”. You should see Core Utilities and Core Utilities (/bin). You want to make sure that the first Core Utilities is installed on your device (not the bin, as that should already be installed upon initial Cydia installation).
* Step 2: Open Mobile Safari and download the Mobile Terminal.deb file from the following Google Code repository. Then choose open with iFile in the upper right-hand corner. You must have iFile installed.
* Step 3: Once iFile loads, a pop up menu will appear. Select “Installer” from the menu and it will install Mobile Terminal.
* Step 4: Respring or Reboot, and you should have a working Mobile Terminal for iOS 5 (it should also work on iOS 4 as well).
* Mobile Terminal is good to use for tons of things. You can even respring your device directly from a terminal if you wish by typing: killall SpringBoard
* That’s just one of many uses for Mobile Terminal. Why do you use it?
