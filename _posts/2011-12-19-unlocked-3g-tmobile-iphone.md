title: Some Users Able to Get 3G Data on T-Mobile Using an Unlocked iPhone

* T-Mobile customers hoping for a chance to carry the iPhone have had a rough last couple of months. First of all, rumors that the carrier would be offering Apple’s handset this year have been effectively debunked. And then there was that whole AT&T takeover debacle.
* So it looks like T-Mobile subscribers will have to stick to carrying unlocked iPhones. This has been possible for years, but due to the lack of 3G data, it’s kind of unpopular. However, a recent report says that 3G data is actually possible on an unlocked T-Mobile iPhone…
* TmoNews, The Unofficial T-Mobile blog, is reporting that some unlocked iPhone users have been able to connect to T-Mobile’s 3G network. The site points to a chat forum where users have uploaded photos, like the one you see above, as proof of their claims.
* Apparently, there are certain areas around the US where T-Mobile “re-farms” spectrum from other carriers on the 1900MHz PCS band. It does this for its HSPA+ “4G” network. And since the 1900MHz band is supported by the GSM iPhone, this makes 3G possible.
* This is only available in certain areas because for the most part, T-Mobile uses 1700/2100 AWS bands for its network — which the iPhone doesn’t support. The re-farmed 1900MHz spectrum is said to be available in Nevada, Utah, California, and other northwest states.
* But 3G data is by no means a “sure thing” in these areas:
* “I can’t emphasize enough how unlikely it is you will find this signal at the moment but, without knowing T-Mobile’s plans for their 1900MHz PCS band, it’s possible we could see more of this pop up in the future but again, it’s likely to be are.”
* Regardless, it’s interesting to see that some unlocked iPhone users are getting 3G speeds on T-Mobile — something that has long since been thought to be impossible. We’re curious to see what this all means for the carrier, and the iPhone, in the future.
