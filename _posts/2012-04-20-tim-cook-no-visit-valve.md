* Last week, a report made its way around the blogosphere claiming that Apple’s CEO Tim Cook was spotted at Valve’s headquarters. This sparked all kinds of speculation regarding the nature of Cook’s visit, and the company’s future plans in the gaming space.
* But alas, the story has been proven to be false. Valve head Gabe Newell debunked the rumor himself during an interview on the weekly Seven Day Cooldown podcast yesterday. And apparently, tech sites weren’t the only ones fooled by the report…
* Kotaku passes along Newell’s comments:
* “We actually, we all sent mail to each other, going, “Who’s Tim Cook meeting with? Is he meeting with you? I’m not meeting with Tim Cook.” So we’re, it’s one of those rumors that was stated so factually that we were actually confused.
* No one here was meeting with Tim Cook or anybody at Apple that day. I wish we were! We have a long list of things we’d love to see Apple do to support games and gaming better. But no, we didn’t meet with Tim Cook. He seems like a smart guy, but I’ve never actually met him.”
* So there you have it. It doesn’t get much more straightforward than that.
* For what it’s worth, Cult of Mac is still sticking to its story that Apple is working on a Kinect-like video game feature for the rumored Apple TV set. “The company’s plans are always subject to change, but gaming for the upcoming television is definitely on the table right now.”
