* While Apple’s online store this morning began accepting orders for $159 AirPods ahead of their Christmas delivery, another pair of earphones from Apple that use W1 chip just got delayed.
* Announced at the iPhone 7 event in September and originally listed as arriving in late-2016, Beats X Wireless Earphones won’t be available before February 2017, according to Apple’s online store.
* As evidenced by the screenshot you see below, the BeatsX listing on the Apple Online Store has been updated to reflect that the earphones will be arriving in February 2017.

* Interestingly enough, the product page at the official Beats website still lists BeatsX as coming in late 2016.

* The $149.95 accessory is available in Black or White. You can order yours through Apple.com in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany and a few other countries.
* CNET’s David Carnoy went hands-on with Beats’ first neckband-style headphone and came away impressed with both their fit and sound. According to Carnoy, they may be Beats’ best new wireless headphones.
* Here’s Carnoy’s video hands-on.
* Apple’s W1 chip powers AirPods, Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, Powerbeats3 Wireless Earphones and BeatsX Wireless Earphones. It enables reliable Bluetooth connections and significantly longer battery life versus headphones without it.
* Additionally, W1 is responsible for smart features that are exclusive to Apple devices, like one-tap Siri access, the ability for AirPods to automatically shut down when you take them out of your ear, seamless iCloud-based pairing, automatic audio routing when you lose one of the AirPods or its battery dies and more.
* W1-driven accessories can be used comfortably with non-Apple devices, in which case they work as any other Bluetooth accessory minus the aforementioned smart features.
