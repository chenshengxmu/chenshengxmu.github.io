* We’ve seen a lot of cool accessories for the iPad over the years, but this one might just take the cake. Double Robotics has just unveiled a new self-balancing motorized stand for Apple’s tablet called the Double.
* The stand uses the iPad for propulsion, as it wheels around on a Segway-like base. And the whole thing is controlled by a second iPad, using the camera on the first for guidance. You really have to see it to believe it…
* As you can see, the Double is built to offer telepresence of sorts — the appearance of being in a place other than your true location. The remote control iPad sees everything that the Double sees, and vice versa.
* The possibilities seem virtually endless for this kind of technology. Imagine professors being able to teach classes from the other side of the world, or a doctor helping with surgery, from thousands of miles away.
* But it doesn’t seem like we’re quite there yet. The quality of the front-facing camera on the iPad is still awful. And at $1,999 a pop, plus the cost of two tablets, these things are still a bit too pricey for most folks.
* Nevertheless, they are pretty awesome. And if you happen to have two grand laying around, why not go for it? Double Robotics is take pre-orders right now, and hopes to start shipping these things by December.
* So, what do you think?
