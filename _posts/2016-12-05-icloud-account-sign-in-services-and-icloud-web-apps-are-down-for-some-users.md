* According to multiple reports on Twitter that have since been officially acknowledged on Apple’s own System Status dashboard webpage, some iCloud services are currently down for an unknown number of customers, including Account & Sign In services and web apps available through iCloud.com.
* Login issues seem to have been affecting users since at 8am Pacific time, according to Apple. Is your device putting up a prompt repeatedly saying it cannot sign in to iCloud? Well, now you know why.
* UPDATE 2:45pm Pacific: All iCloud services are now operational.
* Problems with the web apps have started at about 11am Pacific Time.
* In addition, some folks are reporting problems using Apple’s stock native apps such as Calendar, Contacts and Mail with their iCloud account, which may be caused by misbehaving web apps at iCloud.com.
* Are you having trouble signing in to iCloud.com? Do you see an error message when trying to manage iCloud features via Settings on iOS or System Preferences on macOS?
* Tell us in comments below.
