* Apple is planning to announce its earnings results for Q1 of [fiscal] 2017 on January 31. The company on Wednesday updated its investor website to show that it will be hosting a conference call to discuss the quarter that Tuesday at 2:00pm PT.
* Apple’s first quarter is of course its holiday quarter, which covers the popular 3-month holiday shopping period between October and December. And as usual, all eyes will be on the company to see if it was able to solve its recent growth problems.
* In Q4 2016, Apple posted a revenue of $46.9 billion, down 9% from the same quarter the previous year. iPhones were also down 5%, from 48 million units to 45.5 million units, and Macs were down 14%, dropping from 5.71 million to 4.8 million.
* Its last holiday quarter, however, was record-breaking. Apple sold 74.8 million iPhones and generated nearly $75.6 billion in revenue. Expect the company to be held to a similar standard by analysts when it announces its earnings for Q1 2017.
