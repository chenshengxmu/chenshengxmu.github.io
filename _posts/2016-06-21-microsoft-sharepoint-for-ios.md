* Microsoft on Tuesday announced the official release of a brand new application on the App Store, SharePoint. Available at no charge for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, the software is basically Microsoft’s long-expected iOS client for its SharePoint enterprise collaboration suite.
* Billed as the Intranet in your pocket, the app lets enterprise users stay connected to their company’s intranet while on the go, navigate their company’s web sites and portals, access important content, information and people and more.
* The app connects to SharePoint Online, SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2013 and requires an Office 365 subscription that includes SharePoint Online, or an on-premises SharePoint Server. Hybrid deployments are supported by the app as well.
* Here’s principal Microsoft engineer, Andy Haon, giving a walkthrough of the key elements that bring enterprise intranets into the cloud first, mobile first world.
* The various tabs lined up alongside the app’s bottom—Sites, Links and People—let you quickly see internal site activities, access your recent and popular files, as well as view and arrange lists on your team sites.
* Future updates to SharePoint for iOS iOS will deploy additional enhancements, such as support for cross-company news and announcements. SharePoint for Android and Windows Universal should release before the end of 2016, said Microsoft.
* Here are a few highlights of the app:
