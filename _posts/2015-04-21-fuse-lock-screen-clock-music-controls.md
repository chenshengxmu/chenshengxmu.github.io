* Fuse is a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to combine the music controls and the Lock screen clock. This results in the ability to display both elements at once, something that’s not normally possible on stock iOS 8.
* As you might imagine, Fuse is an extremely simple jailbreak tweak, and it features no options to configure. Once you install Fuse, Lock your iPhone while playing a music track. What results is a dual interface featuring the Lock screen clock and music playback controls. The music controls are relocated towards the bottom of the screen and the Lock screen clock stays in its familiar place towards the top of the Lock screen.
* I’ve never been one to complain about the current behavior of the iOS Lock screen, but Fuse is a good solution for those of you who don’t wish to make compromises. You can find Fuse for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo today.
