* As promised, Apple has released its quarterly earnings report this afternoon. This is the company’s third calendar quarter for 2012, and fourth fiscal quarter, and is the last one before the big holiday season.
* For the period, Apple has reported $36 billion in revenue and $8.2 billion in net profit by selling 26.9 million iPhones, 14 million iPads, 4.9 million Macs, and 5.3 million iPods. More details after the break…
* Overall, it was a pretty tame quarter for the Cupertino company. There weren’t many surprises. iPad sales were fairly low compared to last quarter, but that was expected thanks to the rumored iPad event.
* And this quarter wasn’t near as important as the upcoming holiday reporting period. Apple just released a new smartphone, two new tablets and refreshed computers, and is expecting to have a killer three months.
* Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO:
* Looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2013, we expect revenue of about $52 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $11.75.
* $52 billion in revenue. Think about that.
