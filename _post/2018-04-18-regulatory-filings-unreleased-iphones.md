* Apple could be gearing up to launch some new iPhones pretty soon.
* French website Consomac.fr (Google Translate) discovered this morning a bunch of unreleased iPhone models listed in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database.
* Published yesterday, these filings may be interpreted as a strong indication that the Cupertino technology giant is getting ready to launch several new iPhone models. It’s unclear if these unreleased devices are the rumored iPhone SE 2 models or just Apple’s annual updates to the existing iPhone lineup normally due in the fall.

* The Russian-language document references unreleased handsets by their model identifiers: A1920, A1921, A1984, A2097, A2098, A2099, A2101, A2103, A2104, A2105 and A2106.
* Consumer electronics products that use encryption must be listed in the EEC database.
* Products that appear in this database are typically released in a month or two, meaning new Apple smartphones may be unveiled next month or at WWDC in June.
* What do you make of this, boys and girls?
* Do these unreleased handsets represent Apple’s 2018 iPhone family refresh due this fall or could they perhaps indicate a flurry of second-generation iPhone SE models?
* Leave your comment below.
