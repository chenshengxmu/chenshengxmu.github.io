* This past week was the biggest week for the jailbreak community in quite some time. The iOS 5 untethered jailbreak was released, along with a legal Siri Port entitled Spire. Not only that, but we also saw multitasking gestures make their way to the iPhone by means of Zephyr.
* Like always, please be sure to spread our iPhone, iPad, and iOS video tutorials by sharing our posts on Twitter and Facebook.
