* It feels like a ton of jailbreak tweak developers are back in action following the release of Electra1131, and that means that the jailbreak community can expect to see several new ways of customizing their handsets.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from July 23rd to July 29th. As always, we’ll begin by showcasing our favorites, and then we’ll outline the rest afterward.

* Apollo is my favorite Reddit client ever made for iOS, and ApolloOpener is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you set Apollo as the default app for opening Reddit links.
* If you’re in the same boat, then this tweak is an instant must-have. Installing it improves your Reddit workflow, especially if you don’t like the official Reddit app.
* You can learn more about ApolloOpener and why you should download it in our full review.

* Compatimark is a new jailbreak tweak for Cydia that shows whether new jailbreak tweaks will work or not on your current firmware version.
* Compatimark displays either a blue or a gold shield for compatible tweaks, and nothing for incompatible tweaks. Furthermore, it works with all Packix repository submissions out of the box, with limited support for other repositories in Cydia.
* You can learn more about Compatimark in our full review.

* Personally, I hate the feeling I get when I’m trying to show someone photos from my iPhone and they start swiping through the rest of my Camera Roll. DontSwipe is a new free jailbreak tweak that can prevent this from happening.
* When you install this tweak, you can lock your Camera Roll to a specific photo and prevent anyone but yourself from swiping around. The tweak also locks the other person out of using other controls, such as your home, power, and volume buttons.
* Given that DontSwipe uses Activator to function, it’s super easy to set up and works like a charm.
* You can learn more about DontSwipe and how it helps protect your privacy in our full review.

* LatchKey is a new free jailbreak tweak for the iPhone X that lets you customize the Face ID unlocking glyph.
* Out of the box, the tweak comes with relocation preferences and different themes that you can apply to override the stock unlocking animation.
* If you’re into customization of this nature, then we recommend reading our full review of LatchKey to see what it can do for you.
