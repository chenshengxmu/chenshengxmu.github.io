* iH8sn0w’s popular jailbreak tool for Windows, Sn0wBreeze, has been updated with support for an untethered iOS 5 jailbreak on the iPhone 3GS. iOS 5 is still in the Beta 1 stage, and Sn0wBreeze Beta 2 is the first method available for an untethered iOS 5 jailbreak on the iPhone 3GS.
* Thanks to the old bootrom on the 3GS, users can enjoy a fully untethered iOS 5 Beta 1 jailbreak with the newly released Sn0wBreeze update.
* You can download Sn0wBreeze Beta 2.8.2 from our iPhone downloads page.
* Sn0wBreeze is only available on Windows. To learn how to jailbreak with Sn0wBreeze, refer to our tutorial.
* Sn0wBreeze was updated about a week ago with support for the iOS 5 Beta 1, and RedSn0w was also updated by the Dev Team with support for a tethered iOS 5 jailbreak. Most likely, RedSn0w will be updated soon for Windows and Mac with support for this untethered iPhone 3GS jailbreak now present in Sn0wBreeze.
* Let us know how Sn0wBreeze Beta 2 works for your iPhone 3GS on the iOS 5 beta. Remember, untethered support does not yet exist for the iPhone 4.
