* After testing it with registered developers and public beta testers, Apple today released the iOS 9.3 software update for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. A major new software update, iOS 9.3  is now available on all iOS 9-comptaible devices in Settings right General → Software Update and brings several headline new features along with a bunch of under-the-hood tweaks and enhancements.
* Some of the big new features of iOS 9.3 include Night Shift Mode, passcode or Touch ID protection of your notes, enhancements in News and Health apps, as well as important enhancements for iOS in the classroom such as managed Apple IDs, multi-user support on iPads and more.
* Available via a dedicated toggle in Control Center and in Settings → Display & Brightness → Night Shift, Night Shift Mode reduces the amount of blue light emitted by your device’s screen, which allows your eyes to relax so that falling asleep is easier.

* Night Shift Mode can be enabled manually or automatically, in which case iOS 9.3 uses your device’s clock and location services to determine when it’s sunset in your location. It then automatically shifts the color of the display to the warmer end of the spectrum, which makes it easier on your eyes.
* Or, schedule it and cherry-pick the times when iOS will enable and disable Night Shift Mode. This mode is unavailable when an iPhone is in Low Power Mode.
* Here’s Andrew’s iOS 9.3 walkthrough video.
* Apple has expanded 3D Touch in iOS 9.3 by adding new Home screen shortcuts and in-app Peek and Pop gestures to its own apps like Settings, App Store, iTunes, Stocks, Weather and Compass. For instance, the Settings app now provides access to popular toggles like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Battery right in the 3D Touch shortcut menu.

* You can now go to the your Purchased section or Update All apps by pressing the App Store’s icon on the Home screen and selecting one of the new shortcuts. Within the App Store app, Peek and Pop gestures are now supported to preview apps.
* The Compass app has gained its very first shortcut menu with two options—Start Level and Start Compass— while Calculator now lets you Copy Last Result.
* As a quick refresher, we’ve covered 3D Touch shortcuts and gestures in stock apps like Messages, Safari, Mail, Music, Camera, Maps, Phone, Reminders and iBooks.
* Using the companion Watch app in iOS 9.3, it is now possible to pair multiple Apple Watch devices running watchOS 2.2 or later to a single iPhone. Apple was criticized for limiting Apple Watch pairing to a single device so this new feature should be good news for those who happen to own multiple watches, like developers and rich people.

* iOS 9.0’s much improved Notes app gets even more useful on iOS 9.3. Users can now create a passcode to secure notes that contain sensitive data, or protect their notes with Touch ID. Once created, a passcode or Touch ID can be used to lock individual notes in order to protect them from prying eyes.

* Also, notes can now be sorted using date created, date modified or using the alphabetic sort option, and media from notes can now be saved to your photo library.
* Health data types such as Weight, Workouts and Sleep now make it easier to find compatible apps by means of a new slider menu. More importantly, Health now integrates move, exercise and stand data, along with goals, from your Apple Watch so you can see all your health metrics in a single place and share them with other apps.

* Apple’s news-reading app, News, brings improved recommendations with suggested trending topics and Editors’ Picks right in the For You section. Moreover, stories can now embed videos which can be played in-line. News now works in landscape mode on iPhones and improved caching makes the latest stories appear much faster.

* CarPlay, Apple’s platform for the connected car, has received improvements pertaining to Music and Maps apps. CarPlay’s Apple Maps app now supports the Nearby feature to help you find gas, parking, restaurants, coffee and other points of interest.

* As for Apple Music, CarPlay owners can now browse their personalized New feed and the For You section with songs, artists, and albums handpicked by experts.
* iOS 9.3 brings multi-account support to iPads that are used in the education environment, allowing student to log in to any iPad with a four-digit passcode and personalize the device with their own settings. Upon logging into their iPad, student can instantly access all their apps, books and documents.

* To support the new education features, school administrators can now create Managed Apple IDs using Apple School Manager. A brand new web app, Apple School Manager is the place to manage Apple IDs, apps and devices, build and distribute new courses and more.
* Teachers, on the other hand, can take advantage of the new Classroom app to guide students through a lesson, see their progress and keep them on track with features like Screen View, Remote Control and more.
* In addition to the big features, iOS 9.3 packs in a number of small, meaningful improvements. For instance, the software brings support for the Wi-Fi Calling feature to Verizon customers, allowing them to place and receive phone calls on the Verizon network through a Wi-Fi connection.
* There’s also a carrier update for T-Mobile users to solve an issue which prevented apps from loading over a cellular connection. iOS 9.3 unbricks devices affected by the January 1, 1970 bug and prevents users from moving the time on December 31, 2000 past 7pm to prevent the bug entirely.
* Moreover, in the stock Photos app you now duplicate a Live Photo as a high quality still photo, your Wallet items have shortcuts to corresponding apps, PDFs sync via iCloud in iBooks, data usage numbers are available for the Wi-Fi Assist feature and accessory firmware updates can be deployed via the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector.
