* A third-generation Apple Watch is expected to ship in the fourth quarter of this year, according to a new report Monday from Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes.
* Commenting on Apple supplier Quanta Computer’s recent earnings report, the publication said that the Taiwanese firm should see its peak season in the second half of this year, with server shipments expected to enjoy growth and “the next-generation Apple Watch set to begin shipments in the fourth quarter.”
* The next Apple Watch, as we previously reported, is expected to feature improved battery life thanks to a third-generation Apple-designed chip, tentatively named “S3,” plus a rumored micro-LED display technology with a glass-film touch screen and other optimizations.

* Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has it that that the next iteration of Apple’s wearable device would finally include a brand new model featuring an LTE modem from Intel that should reduce its reliance on iPhone and permit users to conduct many tasks without a nearby phone.
* Apple is already in talks with carriers in the US and Europe about offering the cellular version, with Bloomberg stating that the new watch is planned for release by the end of this year.
* Daring Fireball’s well-connected John Gruber has heard “from an unconfirmed little birdie” that Apple Watch Series 3 may also sport an all-new form factor, without providing specifics.
