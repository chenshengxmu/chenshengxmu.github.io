title: Logitech unveils colorful new Keyboard Folios for iPad and iPad mini
---
* Logitech today launched two new interesting accessories for your iPad: the Keyboard Folio and Keyboard Folio Mini. As the names suggest, the former is for your full-size 9.7-inch iPad and the latter is for its little brother, the 7.9-inch iPad mini. These act as both a protective cover which attaches to your device magnetically and a physical Bluetooth-enabled keyboard with custom iPad shortcuts. Additionally, a hands-free flip stand props up your device in two comfortable viewing angles…
* Logitech bills the two accessories as “marrying aesthetics and practicality.”
* To take the design a step farther, we combined Logitech’s expertise and experience in keyboards with high-quality materials to bring a sense of sophistication to the functional protection people want and need for their tablets.
* The covers are available in a few nice vivid colors to suit your mood and feature instant on/off functionality that wakes your tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when you close it.
