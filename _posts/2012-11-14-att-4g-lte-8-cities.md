* As part of its $14 billion LTE network expansion, U.S. carrier AT&T today announced the launch of speedy LTE radio technology in eight new cities: Milwaukee, WI; Denver, CO; Louisville, KY; Orlando, FL; York, PA; Tacoma, WA; Annapolis, MD; and Provo, UT. Apple users in these areas who own an LTE device such as the iPhone 5 or cellular iPads should see notable speed gains over the coming days. Just last week, the carrier rolled out LTE in Little Rock, Arkansas and expanded LTE coverage in Bakersfield, California and Florida Keys, Florida…
* AT&T via media releases confirmed LTE roll-out in Louisville, Milwaukee, Tacoma, York, Daytona Beach, Anne Arundel County, Denver and Provo-Orem. Customers in Greater Seattle Area should also see enhanced LTE coverage.
* The carrier intends to cover 99 percent of all locations in its 22-state wireline service area with 4G LTE and expects to have about 118Mhz of spectrum nationwide.
* Despite such an aggressive roll out, rival Verizon remains the nation’s top carrier in terms of 4G LTE speeds and coverage. Verizon now has nearly two-thirds of U.S. population covered with LTE and is expected to complete the commercial deployment of the technology by mid-2013.
* What’s your experience with 4G LTE on AT&T been like so far?
