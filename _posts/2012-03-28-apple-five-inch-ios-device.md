* File this one under the Unlikely category. According to an otherwise pretty credible Japanese blog, citing “reliable Chinese sources”, Apple is working on a brand new mobile device featuring a five-inch Retina display. Specifically, it should have a screen resolution of either 1,600-by-960 pixels or 1,280-by-960 pixels. The gizmo is said to be released some time in 2013.
* This sounds a lot like a blown-up iPod touch of sorts, which in its current incarnation incorporates a 3.5-inch Retina display with a 640-by-960 pixel resolution. Apple isn’t the one to follow market trends – it dictates them instead.
* That being said, however, surely club Cupertino must have been paying attention to the five million shipment milestone of Samsung’s Galaxy Note phablet…
* According to the machine-translated Macotakara article (Google translation):
* Apple seems to have a plan of five-inch Retina display device in 2013. According to Chinese reliable source, Apple LCD seems to be developing supplior of 5-inch Retina display. The 5-inch Retina display product has which is expected to be released in 2013, and resolution of this LCD will be 1,600 x 960 pixel (800 x 480 by legacy majour) or 1,280 x 960 pixel (640 x 480).
* Maybe it’s that iPad mini we’ve been hearing about or perhaps Apple is developing a brand new product aimed squarely at the portable gaming market. Yes, I’m looking at you, Sony and Nintendo.
* Conveniently, that’s where the Foxconn-Sharp deal could prove handy as Apple is thought to be very much interested in Sharp’s Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) display technology.
* The benefits of IGZO panels over the traditional LCD screens include sharp colors, lower power consumption and pixel densities of as high as 330ppi – enough to justify the Apple-coined Retina moniker.
* IGZO panels don’t need dual LED bars to illuminate the pixels and allow for wide viewing angles, negating the need for a premium display technology called In-Plane Switching.
* Not sure about you, but I for change would love to be able to enjoy graphics-intensive games on something akin to an oversized iPod touch.
* Is Apple spreading itself thin here? Is a five-inch Retina device atypical of Apple’s otherwise compact product matrix? And while we’re at it, what about platform fragmentation? Meet us in comments.
