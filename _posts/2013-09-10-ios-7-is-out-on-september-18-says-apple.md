* Apple’s keynote is underway at the Town Hall campus in Cupertino, California and the company has just confirmed the software will be released for public consumption next wednesday, September 18, 2013. There are over two hundred new features in iOS 7, including Control Center, better multitasking, improved notifications, iTunes Radio and of course a brand new flattened interface. Apple also surprised journalists by playing a few new ringtones and alert tones that are not present in Beta builds…
* The operating system will be available for the iPhone 4 and later, iPad 2 and later, iPad mini and the fifth-generation iPod touch.
* Will you be upgrading come next Wednesday?
