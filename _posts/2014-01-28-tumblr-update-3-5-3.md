* Good news for Tumblr users this afternoon. The micro-blogging site has posted an update for its iOS client, bringing the app to version 3.5.3. The update brings about a handful of improvements, and a major new user mentions feature.
* Mentions work on Tumblr just like they do on other social networks. Typing ‘@’ and a username when you’re writing a post will generate a link to that person’s blog and push an alert to that person letting them know they were mentioned…
* Here are the release notes from Tumblr:
* “User Mentions! Just type @ and a username when you’re writing a post. We’ll create a link to their blog and let that person know that you mentioned them. They will be thrilled by this. If someone mentions you, we’ll send you a push notification, and then you too will know the thrill of being mentioned.”
* I suppose it was just a matter of time before the mention feature reached the popular blog site, and at least the implementation seems solid. It adds a social layer to the service, which may potentially change the way some folks post and repost things.
* Tumblr was purchased by Yahoo last year for just north of $1 billion, and the app was last updated in November. That update brought about a revamped UI design for iOS 7 including a total dashboard makeover, new compose screen, and much more.
* If you’re interested, you can find the latest version of Tumblr in the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad, for free.
