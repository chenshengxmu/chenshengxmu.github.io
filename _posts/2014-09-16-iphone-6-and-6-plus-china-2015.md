* Apple could have to wait until next year to launch the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in China, according to 21st Century Business Herald. The Chinese news site is reporting today that the handsets have failed to receive the necessary approval from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
* If true, this would be a huge blow to Apple, who some believe was hoping to ship as many as 80 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus units by the end of the year. China of course has two of the largest carriers in the world, China Mobile and China Unicom, and is an important market for the company.
* Unfortunately, this certification from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is required for Apple to sell its new iPhones in the country. The firm can re-apply for approval at a later date, but that date is unknown, leaving iPhone 6/Plus availability in China uncertain.
* Apple announced last week that both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will launch on Friday, September 19th, in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK. A second round of sales will begin a week later on September 26 in 20 additional markets.
