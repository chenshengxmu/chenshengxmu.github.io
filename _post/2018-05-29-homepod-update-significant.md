* The newly released HomePod update is the Siri-based speaker’s most significant software update since the device was first released in February. Version 11.4 adds key features, including multi-room and stereo pairing.
* To deploy the latest HomePod software, launch the Home app on your iOS device with iOS 11.2.5 or later, and then tap the Home tab at the bottom and hit the arrow icon in the top-left corner.
* Next, tap Software Update underneath the Speakers heading and follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the update.
* TUTORIAL: How to update HomePod software
* Your HomePod automatically installs new software updates as they become available. Upon updating your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to iOS 11.4, the new HomePod software should download and install automatically. You can turn off automatic HomePod updates, if you like.
* The new HomePod software has the same 11.4 version number as today’s iOS 11.4 and tvOS 11.4 releases. Apple also released the new watchOS 4.3.1 software for Apple Watch.
* First announced in June 2017, the HomePod speaker wasn’t put on sale until early this year after numerous delays. Priced at $349, the HomePod is one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market. Despite this, in its first quarter of release, HomePod allowed Apple to become the world’s fourth largest smart speaker maker, according to one researcher, even though the product is only available in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The product arrives in Canada, France, and Germany starting on June 18.
* Later this year, Apple could reveal a less expensive HomePod, this one with the Beats name attached.
* iOS 11.4 includes AirPlay 2 multi-room audio and support for stereo pairs.
