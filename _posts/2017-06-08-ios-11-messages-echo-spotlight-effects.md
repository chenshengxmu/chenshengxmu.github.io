* Apple’s expressive Messages app gained some interesting fullscreen effects with last year’s release of iOS 10. With iOS 11, Apple is bringing a pair of brand new effects to the built-in messaging app, called “Echo” and “Spotlight”.
* The two new effects are in addition to the existing ones: Balloons, Celebration, Confetti, Love, Lasers, Fireworks and Shooting Star. To use these effects, press the Send button in Messages with 3D Touch, then tap the Screen tab at the top to swipe through real-time effect previews.
* Watch the new Messages effect in action.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube.
* As for the so-called bubble effects, no new ones have been added in iOS 11. iOS 10 currently includes five different bubble effects: Slam, Loud, Gentle and Invisible Ink.
* How do you like the two fancy new effects in Messages for iOS 11?
