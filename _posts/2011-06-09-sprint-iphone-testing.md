* Apple made headlines earlier this year when they finally took their iPhone to a 2nd U.S. carrier. The popular smartphone had been an AT&T-only device since its inception in 2007, so needless to say users were glad to finally have an option.
* But what about Sprint customers? Will they ever see an iPhone offered by their carrier? It doesn’t take a magic 8 ball to know that all signs point to yes, but we’ve recently heard more “confirmation” that a Sprint-branded iPhone exists…
* The folks over at 9to5Mac are reporting that they’ve heard from an unknown source that a Sprint-compatible iPhone is currently being tested at the Cupertino campus. The device has even been seen floating around Sprint’s research and development department.
* “Sources tell 9to5Mac that a version of the iphone for Sprint’s network is currently in advanced testing. The physical design of this device is akin to the iPhone 4 of today, so this might be the iPhone 4S device with support for all carriers we’ve been hearing whispers about.”
* Although the site doesn’t speak of the source’s credibility, the gossip does align with recent speculation. We’ve heard several rumors that the next iPhone will be compatible with all 4 major carriers in the U.S.
* We’ve also seen interesting job postings by Apple, calling for carrier specialists in the Kansas City area right next to Sprint’s headquarters. So it doesn’t seem to be a question of if Sprint is going to get the iPhone, but when?
* With no announcement of a new device at Apple’s developer’s conference this week, it seems like the delayed iPhone refresh rumors were spot on. I guess we’ll have to wait until September for an official announcement, but things are looking up for iPhone hopefuls on the nation’s 3rd largest network.
* Are you a current Sprint customer looking to get the iPhone? Would you switch to Sprint if it got the iPhone?
