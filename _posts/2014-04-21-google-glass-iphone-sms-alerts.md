* If you’re among early adopters who dropped $1,500 for a Google Glass when Google for a single day opened up its Glass Explorer program to everyone, you’ll be delighted to learn that your pricey smart googles will soon be able to display notifications for incoming iPhone text messages in your field of vision.
* In addition, a new Calendar card will also launch later this week, allowing you to interact with calendar items on your timeline.
* Google’s recently upgraded its Glass software to Android KitKat, allowing them to “bring you faster updates” so these upcoming goodies are part of the new rapid development and roll-out process…
* According to a post by the Glass team over at Google+, iPhone users won’t be able to reply to incoming text messages from their Glass “due to some limitations with iOS.”
* Receiving iPhone SMS on the Glass won’t require a special software – you’ll simply go to your iPhone’s Bluetooth settings and turn on ‘Show Notifications’ for your paired Glass to have new text messages appear as notifications on your Glass.
* As for the Calendar Glassware, enabling it on the Glassware tab in MyGlass lets you see your agenda to the left of the home screen.
* “Tap a calendar card from your timeline and you can change the title, time, location, and RSVP as well as delete the event or dismiss it from your timeline,” writes Google.

* Both updates will become available “later this week” so keep your eyes peeled.
* Both features will probably require an update to Google’s companion Glass iOS app, MyGlass, available as a free download in the App Store.
* Here are six ways ‘Google Screwed Up Google Glass,’ according to Forbes.
