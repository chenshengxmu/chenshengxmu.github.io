* Apple this morning announced via a press release that its third-generation iPad will be rolling out to twelve additional countries this coming Friday, April 20. The device will land on store shelves in South Korea, Croatia and ten more countries.
* The gizmo is also hitting the markets in Thailand, South Africa and seven additional countries shortly thereafter, the company has confirmed.
* Here’s the full list of countries included in the third wave of the iPad roll out: Brunei, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Malaysia, Panama, St Maarten, Uruguay and Venezuela.
* A week later – on Friday, April 27 – the new iPad will be available in Colombia, Estonia, India, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, South Africa and Thailand, Apple said.
* The press release notes that “4G LTE is supported only on AT&T and Verizon networks in the U.S. and on Bell, Rogers and Telus networks in Canada”.
* The Cupertino company recently found itself under a barrage of criticism in Australia, Europe and other countries over a somewhat misleading 4G moniker.
* As the device does not support a myriad of 4G LTE frequencies used by carriers the world over, it falls back in some countries to 3G HSPA+ speeds, prompting watchdogs to accuse Apple of false advertising.
* As a result, the company had to clarify its marketing message in Australia and elsewhere to inform customers of these limitations.
