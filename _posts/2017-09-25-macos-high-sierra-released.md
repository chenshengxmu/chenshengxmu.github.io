* As originally promised, Apple today released the public version of macOS High Sierra.
* Apple’s latest and greatest operating system is available as an over-the-air update via the Software Update mechanism on any Mac running an older macOS version. The standalone macOS High Sierra installer can be grabbed at no charge from Mac App Store.
* This lets you create a USB install drive to install macOS High Sierra to multiple machines without redownloading, as well as perform clean installs and keep a copy of the installer safe for troubleshooting purposes.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* Apple provides a nice tutorial detailing the steps for upgrading to macOS High Sierra.
* The system requirements for macOS High Sierra are the same as those for macOS Sierra:
* iF your Mac runs macOS Sierra it can run macOS High Sierra, too. To see your Mac’s model year and other underlying hardware information, choose About This Mac from the Apple menu.
* OVERVIEW: Apple’s new HEIF/HEVC media formats in iOS 11 & macOS High Sierra
* Some features require a more powerful Mac. For instance, playback of 4K HEVC video requires a Mac running a sixth‑generation Intel Core chip or newer. For the full list of features supported across different Macs, check out Apple’s official macOS Feature Availability webpage.
* For the security content of macOS High Sierra, seeApple’s support document.
* One of the biggest updates, macOS High Sierra brings many new features to Mac users.
* macOS High Sierra brings the new Apple File System (APFS) to your Mac. APFS is the successor to HSF+, the company’s longtime file system on Macs, and is also the default file system in iOS, watchOS and tvOS.
* While there were no big issues with HSF+, it wasn’t build for modern storage like SSDs. APFS was built not just for today’s storage needs, but storage needs of the future as well.
* OVERVIEW: What to know about transitioning to APFS
* APFS comes with built-in encryption out of the box that makes securing your Mac easier than ever. Your data is now more protected with perks like automatic system snapshots, making recovering data easier and backups (like Time Machine) better than ever.
* APFS is fully designed for 64-bit architecture.

* One of my favorite features is the speed and efficiency.
* APFS can help you save space in various ways, especially when duplicating files. On a traditional drive, copying a file or folder literally makes a copy. On an APFS drive, however, only one copy of the file exists on the disk and all of its copies are referenced.
* As a result, duplicating a file on an APFS drive no longer takes up any additional space. Plus, APFS can literally copy a half a gigabyte or larger file instantly and gather the size of a folder with almost no delay. By speeding up common file operations, APFS makes your Mac more responsive than before.
* Safari 11 in macOS High Sierra is faster and more responsive than before.
* Apple boasts many new JavaScript benchmarks that keep Safari ahead of the other popular browsers. More interesting, however, are its new site-by-site features. You can now go in, on a per-site basis, and set up individual settings such as auto-Reader mode, microphone and camera access, zoom level, content blockers, auto-play and location privileges.
* Autoplay blocking is another favorite feature.

* Ever land on a site that autoplays a video with sound? Safari now stops that cold.
* You now have the options of stoping all videos, allowing all videos, or just pausing those that contain audio. This is a super handy feature that has worked very, very well in my testing.
* Of all the apps in High Sierra, Photos has seen the biggest improvements.
* There’s now a wealth of new features for amateur and pro photographers alike. You can organize your library quicker with all-new filters, a new persistent sidebar lets you sort media by type, Memories now include over a dozen new slideshow types and more.
* Plus, Photos now comes with built-in support for animated GIFs.

* The editing experience has received significant improvements and a brand new layout.
* The Edit view now provides precise curve-based editing, several new professional filters and the ability to open images directly in a third party app for more in-depth editing. And with all-new Project Extensions, third-party apps can make various project-based features available to Photos, like creating print products, websites or slideshows.
* And last but not least, macOS High Sierra brings support for HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, also known as H.265, which is the latest standards-based video compression technology) and HEIF (High Efficiency Image Coding) formats that can cut storage consumption in half.
* Of course, a more powerful Mac will deliver better HEVC performance. Apple says that encoding and editing of 4K HEVC content requires a Mac with a sixth‑generation Intel Core processor or newer, like the latest iMac and MacBook Pro models.
* There are many, many other under-the-hood enhancements in macOS High Sierra.
* For instance, you can now snap a Live Photo of a FaceTime call with both parties being notified when a photo was taken. macOS High Sierra is also the first Mac operating system release with comprehensive support for virtual (VR) content creation and rendering—something many people will be looking to take advantage of on their Mac.

* Even the Touch Bar system shortcuts have received a boost in High Sierra with the addition of all-new buttons for AirPlay, NightShift and Picture-in-Picture while watching a video.
* The following new technologies and features in macOS High Sierra make your Mac more reliable, capable and responsive whilst laying the foundation for future innovations.
* Metal 2
* Media & VR support
* Apple File System
* It is a major release, don’t you agree?
* macOS High Sierra is a very impressive release, especially knowing Apple has put a lot of effort into optimizations for power users and pros that depend on their machines day in and day out.
