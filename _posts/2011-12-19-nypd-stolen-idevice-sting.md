* It’s pretty clear that Apple’s iPhone and iPad line is a popular one amongst shoppers, but while most will pick up their new gadgets the legitimate way, it is an unfortunate fact that some will seek to procure their Apple devices by less scrupulous means.
* New York City is one place where iPhone thefts in particular are almost commonplace, and iPads are fast becoming one of the most sought after devices as well. That’s why the New York City Police set about trying to track down the places where stolen iPhones and iPads go once they have been lifted, and as a result have made 141 arrests.
* Checking out over 600 locations believed participate in the sales of stolen Apple hardware, the NYPD made the arrests after offering to sell devices for between $50 and $200, all the while clearly identifying that the goods were stolen.
* “Undercover NYPD officers sold the electronics to merchants at more than 600 stores around the five boroughs this week — asking from $50 to $200 for iPhone 4s and iPad 2s — after clearly stating the popular gadgets were stolen, said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne.
* The sting — which nabbed clerks and workers at businesses such as supermarkets, barbershops, pawnshops and bodegas — began Tuesday and continued through yesterday.
* “That’s our intention, to reduce the places where people who steal these things can go and sell them,” said NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. “If someone is offering you an iPad for way below market value, you have to realize that it’s most likely stolen.”
* The high desirability of Apple’s hardware coupled with the economic situation across the globe has led to the inevitable, with iPhones and iPads top of thieves’ wishlists this Christmas. Remember to keep your devices safe, folks. And if someone does offer you an iPhone, iPad, or anything else as part of a deal that is too good to be true, then it probably is!
