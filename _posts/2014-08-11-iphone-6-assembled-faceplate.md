* A Taiwanese blog has posted a series of images that allegedly picture fully assembled black and white faceplate options for a rumored 4.7-inch iPhone 6 variant.
* The images offer perhaps the best depiction of the upcoming Apple handset thus far. The fully assembled 4.7-inch panel is shown off along with flex cables, mounting structures and cover glass.
* As a quick reminder, the iPhone 6 should be unveiled alongside its bigger 5.5-inch counterpart at a media event on September 9.
* Earlier this morning, we published a treasure trove of leaked part images that seemingly hint at the embedded Apple logo on the back, a protruding iPod touch-style rear camera and the slightly recessed volume button cutouts along the edges…
* According to Taiwanese blog Apple.club [Google Translate], via AppleInsider, the images depict notably skinnier side bezels of the claimed 4.7-inch display part, speculated to allow for one-handed use.
* For the most part, these new shots largely match up with prior leaks of assumed iPhone 6 components. The front panel also shows holes for the front-facing camera and the ambient light sensor.
* What you can’t possibly glean from these images is whether the display component uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass or a rumored sapphire-made cover glass.
* Both black and white faceplates, along with the previously leaked components like a gold SIM card tray, support the theory that the iPhone 6 will come in same color options as the current iPhone 5s generation.
* On the back, there’s a purported display package complete with backlight installed. The protective film is covering most of the panel and you can clearly see the part’s QR code and serial number.

* Other takeaways: the nicely rounded edges and a cutout for the Touch ID home button.
* AppleInsider explains:
* Missing is the usual electromagnetic shielding that has in the past been attached directly to the faceplate. It is possible that the metal plate will be added on during a later stage of production, or Apple may have rejiggered the phone’s internal design to marry the component with the rear chassis.
* The new iPhones are expected to come in 4.7 and 5.5-inch varieties, featuring an all-new design with an even thinner appearance, running an Apple-designed A8 chip said to be clocked at 2GHz or more per core and likely sporting a 13-megapixel Sony-made camera with optical image stabilization.
