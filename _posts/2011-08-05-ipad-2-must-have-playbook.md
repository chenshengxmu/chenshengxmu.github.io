title: iPad 2 No Longer Must-Have Gadget, Ousted by BlackBerry PlayBook? (Yeah Right)

* In what can only be described as a bold claim, and possibly a bit of link bait, voucher site iLoveCashback.com has claimed that Apple’s wunder-tablet, the iPad 2, is no longer the must-have gadget.
* The new champion? RIM’s BlackBerry PlayBook. It’s ok, we’ll wait for you to pick yourself back up off the floor.
* Up? Ok, here’s how they come to that rather amazing conclusion…
* According to iLoveCashback’s Managing Director, Brad Blake, the BlackBerry PlayBook made up an impressive 22% of searches on the site, with Apple’s iPad 2 and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab both lagging behind. He also shared that ‘tablet’ is now the number one search, too.
* “The Playbook is definitely moving ahead of the iPad and we can also see that people are placing orders for it”
* RIM’s PlayBook has found itself to be a universal let down for everyone except the searchers of iLoveCashback, and sales have been lacklustre to say the least. Rumors have been abound that RIM has been considering killing the tablet altogether, though the Canadian outfit has obviously denied them.
* So there we have it. After that extremely scientific, and clearly wholly accurate deduction from a little-known money saving web site, there’s only one thing that can be done.
* Apple needs to close down shop and move to Canada.
* Right?
* Do you find yourself looking at your iPad 2 and, despite the smaller screen, lack of apps, and missing email client, wishing that you had chosen a PlayBook instead?
* We didn’t think so.
