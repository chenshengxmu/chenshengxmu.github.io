* I don’t know about anyone else, but just seeing the word “rumor” at this point makes me cringe. It seems like we saw enough gossip regarding Apple’s latest tablet over the last few months to write a novel. Or at least several chapters of one.
* But was it really worth it, reporting each new rumor nearly every day? How much of the gossip ended up materializing? And how much of it didn’t pan out? We answer these questions, and more, inside…
* The chatter surrounding Apple’s new iPad was actually pretty accurate. Especially when you compare it to the gossip we heard leading up to Apple’s fall iPhone event last year. Here’s what the rumor mill got right:
* Other rumors regarding the tablet’s pricing and availability panned out, but they weren’t really worth mentioning. Now onto what the rumor mill got wrong.
* Obviously there were other rumors that didn’t materialize, like the last-minute report that the new iPad might feature some kind of specialized haptic feedback. But they didn’t pickup much traction. And for the record, the no-home button thing was never really a rumor. It was a misconception.
* As you can see, the rumor-mill was pretty spot on as far as the new iPad goes. Some might argue that this kind of talk ruins the fun and surprise of Apple’s product announcements. Others might argue that it gives consumers a good idea of what to expect so they can plan accordingly.
* We just think it made for some interesting discussion and speculation leading up to Apple’s iPad event. But we’re still glad it’s over — at least for now.
* So, about that next iPhone…
