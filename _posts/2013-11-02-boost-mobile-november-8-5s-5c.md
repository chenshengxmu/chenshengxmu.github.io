* Back in October, Sprint prepaid subsidiary Boost Mobile announced that it would begin offering the iPhone 5s and 5c on November 8. And with the launch date drawing closer, the carrier has issued a press release with further details.
* This will be the first time that Boost has offered the popular smartphone, and it’s celebrating the occasion by taking $100 of each of the handsets. So you can get an iPhone 5c, sans contract, for as low as $449, and a 5s as low as $549…
* From the press release:
* Boost Mobile, a leader in the no-contract wireless industry with its exclusive Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinking Payments, today announced it will offer iPhone 5s, the most forward-thinking smartphone in the world, and iPhone 5c, the most colorful iPhone yet, beginning Friday, November 8 at www.boostmobile.com and select Boost Mobile exclusive retail stores nationwide. iPhone 5s will be available for $549.99 for the 16GB model, $649.99 for the 32GB model and $749.99 for the 64GB model. iPhone 5c will be available for $449.99 for the 16GB model and $549.99 for the 32GB model. In addition, iPhone 4s will be available for $299.99. iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c customers will be able to connect to the Sprint 4G LTE* network.
* “With the launch of iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c on Boost, consumers have access to the smartest phones on the smartest plan with no contract required,” said Andre Smith, vice president-Boost Mobile. “Now consumers can combine the forward-thinking innovations of iPhone 5s and brilliant colors of iPhone 5c on the only wireless plan where the longer you stay, the less you pay.”
* For those unfamiliar with Boost Mobile, it offers a $55-per-month unlimited everything plan with ‘shrinking payments.’ For every 6 on-time payments you make, Boost knocks $5 off. It’s worth noting that data is throttled beyond 2.5GB.
* There’s no word on how long the carrier will be offering the two iPhones at a discount, but it’s not the only prepaid provider doing so. Last month, Virgin Mobile (another Sprint prepaid subsidiary) launched the 5s and 5c with similar deals.
