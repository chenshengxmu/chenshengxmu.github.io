* If you’re still looking for that perfect Mother’s Day gift, you might be interested to know that T-Mobile is going to be hosting a nice little sale this weekend in honor of the holiday. And it looks like the iPhone 5 is going to be one of its featured bargains.
* According to a new report, the fourth largest US carrier is going to be offering the handset as part of a special trade-in deal. Customers will be able to score Apple’s flagship smartphone for $0 down, a savings of $100, with the trade-in of a valid mobile device…
* TmoNews reports:
* “T-Mobile’s advertising for Mother’s Day weekend will focus heavily on the iPhone 5 and the trade-in promotion that has been ongoing since April 12th. That advertising itself will see three national newspaper insertions as well as papers in the top 20 markets.”
* The promotion allows both new and existing qualified customers to trade-in an iPhone 4 or 4S for credit towards the down payment on an iPhone 5. And depending on the trade-in value of the device, they can also decrease their monthly payment from $20 to $15.
* After going for years without an iPhone partnership, T-Mobile finally landed the popular handset last month. It’s offering the device on an unconventional purchase plan, where customers pay as little as $99 up front for an iPhone and $20 per month for two years.
* And that’s just one of the major moves the carrier has made in recent months. It’s also introduced a new ‘UNcarrier’ campaign, with low-cost rate plans and no contracts, launched its LTE network, and as of last week, completed its acquisition of MetroPCS.
* At any rate, if you’re interested in saving money on an iPhone 5, make sure you to check out your local T-Mobile this weekend. There’s no rush though, as the trade-in offer should be good through June 16.
