* Apple appears confident that the new Apple Watch Series 2 will be twice as successful as the original model and has reportedly ramped up chip and component orders for the device, according to Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes that has solid sources in Asian supply chain.
* The publication claims that Apple’s orders regarding Apple Watch Series 2 components for the month of August and September have surpassed two million monthly units each versus “just” one million launch units for the original model, which sold an estimated 12 million units in its first year on the market.
* The notable increase in orders indicates that Apple is still confident about the business outlook for its next-generation smartwatch despite “dwindling sales momentum of the device globally”, said the sources.
* The Apple Watch Series 2 sports built-in GPS, a faster S2 chip, swim tracking, improved water resistance and other features and is now available for pre-order from Apple.
