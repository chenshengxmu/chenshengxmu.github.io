* Remember back in July when we told you about the new updates coming to iCloud? We went hands-on with the beta, which included new apps and other improvements.
* Well this afternoon, Apple pushed the update to the public version of the iCloud web portal. So if you go to iCloud.com and login, you should see the new additions…
* First off you’ll notice two new app icons, which are for Notes and Reminders. Now, everything you do in either of these apps will show up in their web counterparts.
* You might also notice that the Find My iPhone app looks a little different. It’s been updated here as well, and will work with the new “Lost” mode coming in iOS 6.
* I don’t use the iCloud website much because I have a Mac that already has these apps built-in. But for folks on Windows computers, this update may prove fairly handy.
* What do you think of the iCloud update? Useful?
