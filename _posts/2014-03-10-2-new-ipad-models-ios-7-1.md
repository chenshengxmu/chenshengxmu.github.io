* After months of betas and rumors, Apple released iOS 7.1 to the public today. The update features a number of improvements, and apparently it also includes support for two new, unannounced tablet models: the iPad4,3 and the iPad 4,6.
* Before you get too excited though, the consensus is that these new models likely represent minor hardware revisions for existing iPads, rather than all-new products. It seems the model numbers aren’t very far off from current iPad models…
* It’s also possible that these numbers could represent devices headed to new markets. Some carriers, such as China Mobile, use different technology than others, requiring Apple to build separate iPhones/iPads with slightly different internals.
* Both of Apple’s tablet lines were updated in fall 2013, with the full-sized iPad getting an ‘Air’ makeover and the mini gaining a Retina display. And we haven’t heard much in terms of 2014 tablet updates, except for the oft-rumored ‘iPad Pro.’
* Last year, Apple quietly released a ‘new’ third generation Apple TV with a redesigned A5 chip.
