* The new iPad features a new camera system from Apple, who detailed the new camera at its media event that took place today. The iPad features a 5-megapixel camera, which includes advanced optics, auto-focus, and white balance. The upgraded iSight camera also features 1080p video recording.
* While we’re going to have to wait until March 16th to take our own photos with the iPad’s camera, Apple has posted sample photos (and video) taken with the new iPad on its website. And of course, the photos look stunning…

* iOS 5.1 brings along the new camera app to the iPad, which includes auto-exposure, auto-focus, white balance, face detection, and image stabilization software.
* The new iPad is available for pre-order now and will be available on March 16th. We’ll be sure to give you our own photos on launch day, but Apple’s stunning sample photos should suffice in the meantime.
* What do you think of these shots?
