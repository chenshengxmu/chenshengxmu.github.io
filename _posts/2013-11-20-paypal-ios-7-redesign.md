* PayPal has long had a nice albeit somewhat limited iPhone application available in the App Store. Back in September, they gave the software a much-needed redesign while expanding on feature set with useful new capability like the ability to pay at local shops, save offers and order ahead, to name a few.
* Today, the team followed up with another feature-laden update. PayPal 5.2 for iPhone does away with skeuomorphism in favor for a much cleaner look that fits nicely into the overall iOS 7 aesthetics. More importantly, you are now free to withdraw cash, pay using QR codes and more…
* First up, the new iOS 7 style app icon.

* Most of my international transactions are handled by PayPal so I was pleased to learn that the latest build lets me withdraw cash from my PayPal balance to a bank account. Previously, I had to visit the PayPal interface on the web to withdraw funds.
* In addition to just way sleeker and nicer appearance, customers can now scan a QR or bar code to pay at select merchants, making mobile payments even easier and frictionless. Finally, a new option allows you pick among a few start screen templates, each optimized for the specific types of information.

* Just to give you a feel of the scope of redesign, this is what the app used to look like:

* Horrible, no?
* Your changelog for PayPal version 5.2:
* • Need to withdraw some cash from your PayPal balance to your bank? You can do that in your Wallet • Check out our new iOS7 look and feel • Paying just got even easier! Scan a QR or bar code to pay at select merchants • Choose your start screen for fast access to the info you need • We’re still hard at work finding and fixing bugs
* PayPal is available free in the App Store.
* The download weighs in at 26MB, requires iOS 6 or later and unfortunately still lacks the native iPad UI.
