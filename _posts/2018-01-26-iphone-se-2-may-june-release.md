* According to one analyst, a second-generation iPhone SE with wireless charging, and no 3D Touch, may arrive in time for summer 2018 sometime during the May-June timeframe.
* The phone should have a glass backing similar to the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X but won’t feature a pressure-sensitive screen that affords 3D Touch capabilities.
* Digitimes Research analyst Luke Lin:
* For the entry-level sector, Apple is preparing a new inexpensive smartphone similar to the iPhone SE for 2018, featuring the wireless charging functionality, but not 3D sensing. The smartphone will begin mass production in the second quarter with the official launch in May or June, Lin noted.
* It’s entirely possible that by “3D sensing” Lin means the TrueDepth camera, not 3D Touch.
* Still, his report corroborates earlier rumors calling for a next-generation iPhone SE with glass backing supporting the Qi-based wireless charging feature in the first half of 2018.
* iPhone SE 2 may not be the only new iPhone model shipping without 3D Touch.
* According to reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, one of the upcoming LCD models may also drop 3D Touch in order to keep its retail price within the $700-$800 range in the US.
* Earlier this morning, Lin made another prediction saying Apple’s 2018 lineup may consist of a pair of models outfitted with LCD screens (5.7 to 5.8-inch and 6.0 to 6.1-inch) and one Plus-sized OLED model featuring a 6.4 to 6.5-inch screen.
