* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to customize the toolbar at the top of your Mac’s Mail app so you can get more out of it.
* Since every email user’s needs are different, it’s a good thing Apple makes it possible to customize the toolbar in the OS X Mail app.

* To add a new button, simply drag it from the interface into the toolbar. You can also remove items you never use out of the toolbar to remove them and reduce clutter.
* Because so many people send and receive emails each day, it’s good to be able to customize your Mail app to your own needs. Everyone uses their Mail app differently, and having the ability to tailor it to the way you’re going to use it is going to make the app that much easier for you to use on a day-to-day basis.
