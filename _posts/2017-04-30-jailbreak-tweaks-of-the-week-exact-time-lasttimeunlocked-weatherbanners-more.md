* While Cydia has been in a little bit of a lull for the past couple of weeks, that doesn’t stop the occasional tweak from continuing to impress.
* In this piece, we’ll go over all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released this week, starting with our favorites and then outlining all of the rest afterwards.
* Exact Time – FREE

* Exact Time makes it so you can see exactly when your notifications were received, rather than a general estimate.
* As you can see in the before and after images, you get to see the exact time that the notification was received. This replaces the normal “X minutes,” “X hours,” or “X days” gauge that normally appears in the header bar for the notification.
* For those moments where you really can’t be bothered with counting backwards, or where the estimates aren’t precise enough, Exact Time is a lifesaver.
* You can learn more about how Exact Time works in our full review.
* LastTimeUnlocked (iOS 10) –  FREE

* If you suspect that someone besides you is getting into your device, or that perhaps your children are using the family iPad when they’re not supposed to be, then a new free jailbreak tweak called LastTimeUnlocked (iOS 10) could be helpful.
* This tweak replaces the “press home to unlock” text on the Lock screen with information related to the last time the device was unlocked.
* You can customize the text that appears before the time stamp if you want, which automatically means it supports any language you might speak besides English.

* WeatherBanners – $0.99

* If you’re one to check the weather a lot from your iPhone, then you’ll love a new jailbreak tweak called WeatherBanners.
* This tweak lets you use an Activator action to reveal a banner notification with the current weather conditions on demand.
* WeatherBanners automatically uses the first location you have set up in the stock Weather app, whether it’s using your current location or not.
* You can read our full review of WeatherBanners to learn more about how to set the tweak up and how it works.
