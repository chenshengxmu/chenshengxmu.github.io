* Nearly two weeks after releasing the last beta, Apple has today seeded Developer Preview 8 of OS X Yosemite. The update, version 8 1.0, is available for download to users currently running DP 7 in the Mac App Store, as well as in Apple’s online developer center.
* Additionally, Apple has released Public Beta 3 for OS X Yosemite. The Public Beta program began in July, and received its second update late last month. If you’re a member of the program, you can find today’s release in the ‘Updates’ tab of the Mac App Store.
* We’re installing the developer preview now and will be updating this post with our findings. If you discover anything new, please email us the details, and if possible screenshots at tips@idownloadblog.com. Or you can leave a comment regarding the change below!
