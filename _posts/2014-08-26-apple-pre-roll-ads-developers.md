* Apple announced to iOS developers today that it has enabled new ad formats that could help them generate more revenue. Developers can now add pre-roll video and full-screen advertisements to their apps, via iAd.
* The news makes good on a report from back in March, which said the ads would be capable of interrupting a user in-app. It’s more likely, however, that the ads will play at moments of transition, such as at the end of a level.
* Due to their prominent placement, interstitial adverts typically cost more than the usual banner-type iAds seen in App Store apps. Pre-roll video spots also garner higher ad rates, and come in 15, 30 or 60-second blocks.
* In addition to the aforementioned changes, Apple announced this afternoon that it has expanded iAd availability to Russia and Switzerland. This brings the coverage of the company’s iAd network to a total of 16 regions.
* Apple has been struggling to gain traction for its iAd platform since it launched in 2010, due to initial high pricing and other issues. A recent AdAge scoop blamed its failure on Apple’s “low, cocky and downright stingy” approach.
