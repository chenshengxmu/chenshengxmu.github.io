* Yesterday, we informed you of a bunch of Wi-Fi connection issues some owners of the new iPad continue to experience with their device, including intermittent connectivity, slow data speeds and inability to see Wi-Fi networks. Unfortunately, more network-related woes have been discovered.
* Since last week, an unknown subset of international users have been reporting trouble connecting to 3G cellular networks with their 4G LTE iPad. Interesting enough, Apple appears to have deleted a thread at their Support Communities website that by this morning has already ballooned to well over a hundred posts.
* Here’s what folks are saying…
* Users were describing various problems connecting to 3G networks with their 4G LTE iPad. The issue was first reported by AppleInsider. According to the publication, this problem is specific to the new iPad.

* Although most of the posters appear to be international users, a smaller portion of iPad owners from the United States are affected as well.
* Apparently, resetting settings and replacing the SIM card would do nothing to fix the problem. One user indicated that cycling the power on the iPad between three and five times each day helped.
* On a related note, other threads describe cellular reconnectivity issues, full signal bars when there’s no connection whatsoever, GPS not working, inability to connect to 4G when switching from Wi-Fi, to name a few.
* It’s unclear whether any of those are just teething problems that could be fixed with a software update or a sign of a possible flaw with the new Qualcomm MDM9600 3G/4G wireless baseband chip.
* Are you experiencing any cellular- or Wi-Fi-related issues with your new iPad? If so, please share your experience down in the comments.
