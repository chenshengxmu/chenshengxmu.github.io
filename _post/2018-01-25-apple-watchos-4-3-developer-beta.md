* Apple on Thursday seeded the first beta of watchOS 4.3 to developers (build number is 15T5165e). The update can be installed by registered developers using the Apple Watch app on an iPhone running the iOS 11.3 beta (which, as of today, is available to public beta testers as well).
* Today’s beta follows the release of watchOS 4.2.2 earlier this week, which was a minimal update that featured only “improvements and bug fixes.” It’s not known yet what changes watchOS 4.3 will bring.
* We’re currently installing the beta, and will be sure to report back with any findings worth sharing. As always, if you see something we’ve missed, be sure to let us know about it down in the comments!
