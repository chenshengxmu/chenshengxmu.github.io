* Now that the iPhone 4S has been officially jailbroken, it’s time to talk about jailbreak tweaks. In particular, what are some of the best tweaks that are available now for the iPhone 4S?
* If you’re a long time jailbreaker, you no doubt have your staple tweaks and apps that you will install within minutes of successfully jailbreaking your 4S. But if you’re a new iPhone owner, you may be wondering which tweaks you should download first.
* Whether you’re an iPhone veteran or a newbie, stop inside and share your thoughts on our top 10 list…
* Description: This tweak allows you to use the Safari address bar as a combined search and URL bar similar to Google Chrome. Price: Free Additional Coverage.
* Description: These are actually two separate tweaks, but they work so well together that I count them as one. StayOpened keeps the App Store opened after a purchase, and PasswordPilot saves your password so you don’t have to continuously enter your password for purchases. Price: Both free Additional Coverage.
* Description: The ultimate tweak for Twitter, Facebook, Email, RSS, and SMS all in iOS 5’s Notification Center. If you care about information that’s easily accessible, it’s simply a must have. It also comes with Messages+ which is an enhancement to the stock SMS system. Price: Free Trial / $9.99 Additional Coverage.
* Description: It only does everything. No, seriously, it does everything but cook your dinner. And with a few updates from Filippo Bigarella, it might even do that. Price: $2.99 Additional Coverage.
* Description: A staple tweak that a lot of other developers use as a means to invoke their own tweaks. Activator was updated with iOS 5’s built in Twitter support, so it’s extremely handy for sending tweets from anywhere. Price: Free Additional Coverage.
* Description: FaceTime, iCloud, HQ YouTube, and PhotoStream, all over 3G. Need we say more? Price: $3.99 Additional Coverage.
* Description: A copy and paste menu enhance that allows you to save favorite items for easy copy and paste. Price: Free Additional Coverage.

* What do you think? Did we leave out your favorite tweak? Let us know if you agree with out top 10 list in the comment section below.
* Update: It also looks like I forgot to mention one of my personal faves, CallBar. What’s funny is that I was using it while composing this article. CallBar gives you a better way of managing phone calls, and it keeps the Phone app from stealing focus from your current task. Price: $1.99 on sale until 12AM on January 26th, afterwards back to its normal $3.99 price. Additional Coverage.
