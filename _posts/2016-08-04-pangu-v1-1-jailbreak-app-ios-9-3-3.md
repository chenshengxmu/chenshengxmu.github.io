* Pangu has released version 1.1 of its jailbreak app for the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak on Thursday that includes some bug fixes to improve the stability of the app, as well as a new embedded certificate feature that lets you embed the 1-year enterprise certificate.
* This update is purely for the jailbreak app that gets side-loaded to your device itself. You won’t have to re-jailbreak your device, because it’s already jailbroken, but you will need to re-side-load the Pangu app to your device, only with version 1.1 this time.
* Along with the latest bug fixes, which improve the jailbreak’s stability by a long shot, you now get the new ability to embed the 1-year Beijing enterprise certificate into your jailbreak, which Pangu says will guarantee you don’t have to re-side-load the app again until April of 2017 despite having been revoked by Apple after the launch of the Chinese jailbreak tool.
* The process to perform the update is pretty easy. You just have to download the latest version of Cydia Impactor and the latest version of the Pangu IPA file from our downloads page, and then basically put your device into no jailbreak mode by rebooting it. Afterwards, just delete the old app, and then re-side-load the new version 1.1 app and run it.
* Once you have the new app up and running, you can check a new box for the 1-year certificate, perform the semi-untethered jailbreak process, and boom you’re good for a year. Best of all, all of your jailbreak tweaks along with Cydia will still be there when you complete the process.
* This doesn’t circumvent the semi-untethered aspect of the jailbreak. Every time you reboot your device, you are still going to end up in ‘no jailbreak mode,’ and you will have to run the app on your Home screen to re-gain access to Cydia and your tweaks again. Nevertheless, this isn’t all that bad.
* Now that the Pangu jailbreak tool officially installs the 1-year Beijing enterprise certificate after a successful jailbreak, the method of having to use iFunBox to force the 1-year certificate onto your device is now obsolete.
* If you’re unsure what the differences are between the certificates, we have a good read on what makes them different and why the 1-year Beijing enterprise certificate is so sought after.
* Now that the English Pangu jailbreak tool includes the 1-year Beijing enterprise certificate that will reportedly last until April 2017, the jailbreak is starting to look a lot more appealing. Despite the fact that it’s semi-untethered rather than untethered, the process to boot back into jailbreak mode only takes a couple of minutes and gets you rolling again in no time.
* Will you jailbreak now that Pangu supports the 1-year Beijing enterprise certificate? Share below!
