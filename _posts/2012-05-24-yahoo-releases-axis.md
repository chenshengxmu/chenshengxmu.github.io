* In an ongoing effort to prove it can stay relevant in the mobile space, Yahoo quietly released a new web browser for iOS last night. Dubbed Axis, the app combines search and browsing into one experience, “so you can rip through the web.”
* Axis is a universal application, as it works on both the iPhone and iPad. And if you’ve been looking for a new way to browse the web on your iOS device, it might actually be worth taking a look at…
* Here are some of Axis’ standout features:
* Yahoo has also released Axis plug-ins for all of the popular browsers, including Chrome and Safari. So you can pick up on your desktop, where you left off on your mobile. And the syncing between the two clients is actually pretty solid.
* In fact, the entire app is pretty solid. It has a host of useful features like a dedicated Share button that lets you quickly Pin and Tweet webpages. And I really like the way its tabs are set up for switching between multiple websites — it’s really fast.
* If you want to check out Axis for yourself, you can download it from the App Store, for free.
* Have you tried it yet? What do you think?
