* Jailbreak developer Ryan Petrich just pushed SplitMail to his repo, his third tweak part of his TweakWeek challenge. SplitMail is a new tweak for jailbroken iPad that allows to display the left column of your emails in portrait mode in the same way it does while in landscape mode.
* As usual, there is no icon or options in the Settings app. All you have to do is download the app on your iPad and view your emails in portrait mode…
* To get this tweak, your must be jailbroken and add the following repo: http://rpetri.ch/repo. Note that the app will most likely hit the BigBoss repo shortly and disappear from Ryan Petrich’s repo.
