* Before you can start using your Apple Watch, the device must be connected to your iPhone through the Apple Watch companion app, which got recently added to iOS 8.2.
* And when you first pair the wrist-worn gizmo to your iPhone, it shows a unique certificate of authenticity, depending on your model, size and case.
* I was re-reading yesterday excellent article by Wired on Apple Watch development when this cool little feature caught my eye so I thought it deserved a post of its own.
* In the example image seen above, the certificate graphics identifies the device as an Apple Watch Edition featuring an 18-karat rose gold 42mm case with a sapphire crystal and ceramic back.
* It is not too dissimilar to what’s physically etched on the back of the device itself, as shown below. It’s unclear whether or not this digital certificate may be exclusive to the Apple Watch Edition.

* The article doesn’t mention if this has any function beyond replicating physical certificates you get when buying high-end watches from established brands.
* Be that as it may, this is yet another cool little nugget in a series of small touches that pile up to create a magical experience. If you haven’t checked out Wired’s write-up yet, I suggest you give it a read.
* The write-up is packed with intricate behind-the-scenes details on Apple Watch development from the mouth of VP of Technology Kevin Lynch and human interface group lead Alan Dye.

* The story details device prototypes (the very first prototype was actually an iPhone with a Velcro strap), how the gadget was born out of iOS 7 brainstorming sessions, how the team researched horology before setting out to create dozens of watch faces and complication and much more.
* Other tidbits we’ve recently learned include the device’s ability to change the color of animated emoji via Force Touch and track your workouts without an iPhone after it’s learned enough about your stride over time, that it doesn’t depend on Bluetooth when the connected iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network and more.
