* Apple on Wednesday released the third betas of iOS 11.2.5,watchOS 4.2.2, macOS 10.13.3 and tvOS 11.2.5. Registered developers can install the new betas from Apple’s Developer Center, or by using each platform’s respective over-the-air update mechanism.
* The releases come after a two week holiday break, and as we’ve noted in the previous betas, they don’t seem to include any significant new features. Apple typically reserves these .x.x updates for bug fixes, performance bumps and other under-the-hood improvements.
* We’re currently installing today’s betas, and as always, we’ll be sure to report back with any new changes. See any notable differences in today’s betas that we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
