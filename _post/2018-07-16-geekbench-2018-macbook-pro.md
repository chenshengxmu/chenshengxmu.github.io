* Initial Geekbench scores on the recently announced 2018 MacBook Pro lineup show significant improvements over last year’s models. This shouldn’t come as that much of a surprise since this year’s model features the first core increases for the MacBook Pro since 2011. 
* In newly released Geekbench 4 scores, Primate Labs found the newest 15-inch MacBook Pro models saw a 12 to 15 percent increase for single core performance and a 39 to 46 percent rise for multi-core performance compared to the 2017 MacBook Pro. For the 13-inch model, it saw a rise of between 3 and 11 percent for the single-core, and a staggering 81 to 86 percent increase in multi-core performance.
* This year’s MacBook Pro models are the first to feature Intel’s eighth-generation Core processors, with up to six cores available on the 15-inch model and four cores on the 13-inch model.
* Primate Labs’ preliminary conclusion about the 2018 MacBook Pro states:
* What’s interesting is that the 2018 13-inch models are competitive with the 2017 15-inch models in both single-core and multi-core performance, making the new 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro a smaller and lighter replacement for the 2017 15-inch MacBook Pro …
* The 2018 MacBook Pro is the most substantial upgrade (at least regarding performance) since the introduction of quad-core processors in the 2011 MacBook Pro.
* The 2018 MacBook Pro models were announced last Thursday. Besides offering up to six cores, the new laptops can ship with up to 32GB of RAM. Some models also include a True Tone display for the first time. Apple also claims the new models have a “quieter” keyboard than past models, although this point remains open to debate.
* In the market for the new MacBook Pro? The most expensive model will set you back nearly $7,000.
* Geekbench 4 by Primate Labs tests CPU and GPU benchmark across multiple platforms. There are apps available for both Mac and iPhone and iPad.
