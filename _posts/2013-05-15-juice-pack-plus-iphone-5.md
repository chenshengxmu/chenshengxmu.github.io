* Good news for all of you iPhone power users out there. The California-based accessory-maker Mophie took the wraps off a new battery case today for the iPhone 5: the Juice Pack Plus.
* This is the third case we’ve seen from Mophie for the iPhone 5, and it’s also the most powerful. Forget about built-in 1500 and 1700 mAh batteries, this one has a 2,100 mAh pack…

* From Mophie’s website (via MacRumors):
* “The mophie juice pack plus is made for the user who puts their iPhone 5 through the paces morning to night, maxing out features, apps, video, email and web browsing while on-the-go. The case features a 2100mAh battery, translating to an added 120 percent of extra battery life and offers the most power of mophie’s battery case solutions for the iPhone 5 to date. For protection, the juice pack plus’ dual-injected sleeve is engineered with a shockproof band and anti scratch guides to help buffer the impact of falls.”
* Mophie says that the bigger battery more than doubles your iPhone’s battery life, and is good for an additional 10 hours of talk time on 3G or 10 hours of extra internet use on 3G or LTE.
* All of that extra juice comes at a price though. The Plus measures in at 2.63in x 5.60in x 0.70in and weighs 2.68oz, making it bulkier than Mophie’s already-stout Juice Pack Air case.
* Anyway, if you’re interested, the new Mophie Juice Pack Plus is available for purchase on Mophie’s website for $120. It comes in 3 colors, red, white and black, and starts shipping this week.
