* Apple is believed to be abandoning its famous tic-tock cycle where the iPhone sees a major refresh every other year and moving to a three-year refresh cycle for the handset, said Japanese newspaper Nikkei.
* “The move is largely due to smartphone functions having little room left for major enhancements,” reads the report. “A slowing market is another factor”.
* The newspaper learned from sources that Apple will likely take three years between full-model changes of the iPhone, a year longer than the current cycle.
* Reiterating that the changes on the iPhone 7, which should released this fall, are minor and include improved camera quality, water resistance and battery capacity while the design will be almost indistinguishable from the current iPhone 6/6s series.
* The publication also reaffirmed that the iPhone 7 won’t have the 3.5mm headphone jack and said the ‘Plus’ model will offer enhanced imaging “via correction functions.”
* A major iPhone design refresh is said to be in tow for 2017.
* The 2017 10th anniversary iPhone model is said to make a major switch from the existing LCD IPS display technology to the superior AMOLED displays that offer crisper colors, higher contrast, deeper blacks and decreased power consumption.
