* The second installment to the popular run’n’jump game should be hitting Apple’s iTunes servers in New Zealand and Australia just about any minute now. Like it’s predecessor, Temple Run 2 is a free download for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices and Android smartphones and tablets. Those with a US account on the App Store should check the store at around 11pm Eastern, 8pm Pacific Time, when Temple Run 2 is due to hit US shores. The original Temple Run hit over a hundred million downloads across iOS and Android, with more than 75 million downloads in 2012 alone. Admittedly, the sequel should prove just as popular…
* UPDATE: Temple Run 2 now available in the US
* Imangi Studios developed the game in partnership with Fuzzycube Software. In Temple Run 2, gamers get to choose between four playable characters upgradeable with the various power ups and enhancements earned throughout the game.
* TouchArcade had a chance to play a work in progress build and came away pretty impressed:
* I’ve been playing Temple Run 2 for the past day, and for the most part what wasn’t broke has not been fixed. Right from first boot up you’ll get a sense of deja vu as the camera sweeps in on the cursed idol that has been the cause of so much running over the past year and a half.
* The familiar swipe gestures that control your character’s moves are still there, in addition to tilt-based controls.
* “This is totally Temple Run”, the web site proclaims.
* Though the familiar concept hasn’t been changed much (why fix it if it ain’t broken?), environments in Temple Run 2 are “curvy and hilly”, giving everything a more natural and real feel. You’ll enjoy new ziplines glide down and there’s even a section which has you riding the rails in a mine cart, Indiana Jones style.

* You can download Temple Run 2 from the App Store for free now. The original Temple Run is still available as a free download from the App Store and Play Store.
* Though free, both the original Temple Run game and its successor offer in-app purchases, a norm these days.
