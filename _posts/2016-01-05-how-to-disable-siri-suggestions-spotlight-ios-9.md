* Siri on iOS enables a more intelligent Spotlight Search with proactive suggestions that make your device more helpful even before you ask.
* These Siri-powered suggestions automatically appear in Spotlight upon swiping down on any Home screen, offering suggestions for apps that you launch at specific times of the day, people you tend to contact at specific times and more. You’ll also see suggested news and nearby places such as restaurants, gas stations, retail stores and more.
* However, some people find this additional content distracting and useless. If you would like to use Spotlight Search without Siri Suggestions, this quick post will teach you how to disable the feature with just a few taps.
* As a quick refresher, Siri Suggestions are available in Spotlight Search on the iPhone 5 and later, iPad Pro, fourth-generation iPad and later, second-generation iPad mini and later and sixth-generation iPod touch.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Go to the General → Siri & Search section.
* Step 3: Flip the switch next to Suggestions in Search the OFF position.
