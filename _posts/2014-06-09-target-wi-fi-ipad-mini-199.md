* Target is holding a significant sale right now in the run-up to Father’s Day, and is discounting a number of its products. Among the deals, the retailer is offering the 16GB Wi-Fi model of the first generation iPad mini for $199.
* That’s a solid $100 off of the tablet’s original price tag, and even beats out the ‘Special Limited Time’ pricing offered in the refurbished section of Apple’s web store. We’ve got the full details on the short-term promotion below…

* The discounting is only available in-store, and, as noted by MacRumors, supplies appear to be extremely limited—a quick search of my local area shows that only 1 out of the 4 nearby Target stores has the qualifying models in stock.
* It’s also worth reiterating this is the 2012 iPad mini, so it doesn’t have a Retina display, and a new model is expected to launch this fall. But if none of that matters to you, checkout your local Target. The promo ends Saturday, June 14.
