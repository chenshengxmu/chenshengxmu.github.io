* Logitech makes some really nice accessories. Their latest thing, the Solar Keyboard Folio, is a wireless light-powered keyboard for your iPad which also doubles as a cool protective case.
* It’s definitely an interesting add-on in that it takes cues from Logitech’s range of solar-powered desktop keyboards.
* The Folio converts light to power using on-boad solar cell, charging the built-in Bluetooth keyboard in any light, whether indoors or outdoors…
* A press release describes the accessory as “a smart partner for your iPad” that doesn’t add bulk to the device.
* It works in portrait or landscape and supports both the new iPad and iPad 2.
* Just like Apple’s own magnets-based Smart Cover, the Folio also wakes up your iPad automatically when you open it and goes on standby when you close it.
* Logitech claims the keyboard lasts for up to two years if you use it for up to two hours per day on average.
* You can pre-order the Solar Keyboard Folio at the Logitech online store, priced at $129.99. It’s going to become available in the United States and Europe later this month, Logitech said.
* This thing definitely looks like a must-have iPad companion for those who need both extra power on the go and stylish protection for their device.
* Do you like it?
