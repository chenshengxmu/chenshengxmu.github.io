* Apple really seems laser-focused on further removing communication hurdles and friction in iOS 8 by advancing Mail and Messages stock apps in ways more than one.
* For the most part, the changes in these two apps are for the better: Apple hasn’t cluttered their interfaces nor has it changed the familiar design.
* Apple’s thinking and consideration for the end user is especially evident in how iOS 8 handles group chats in Messages and email threads in Mail.
* While you can now finally leave a group chat in Messages, Mail in iOS 8 sports a really useful feature where you tell it to issue a push notification each time someone has replied to a designated email thread…
* How many times have you been frantically checking your mail out of fear that you’ll miss an important update in a thread shared with your boss and co-workers?
* It happens to me frequently and I’m glad Apple has done something about it.
* As TUAW notes, to start receiving alerts for replies to an email thread, swipe to the left on a desired message, choose More and then hit the Notify Me button from the menu.

* After confirming the prompt, you will receive a push notification anytime someone replies to the thread, ensuring you remain in the loop without having to check your inbox incessantly.
* You’ll notice a nicely designed bell icon in your message list which denotes any email thread that has reply notifications turned on.

* To disable notifications for a particular email thread, swipe to the left again, tap More and then hit the Stop Notifying button.
* In addition to this feature, Mail in iOS 8 allows you to mark an email as read (or flag it) by swiping, similar to Dropbox-owned Mailbox. You can even long-swipe to delete a message, too.
* And should your incoming messages include reservations, flight confirmations or phone numbers, Mail will recognize these items and offer appropriate actions.
