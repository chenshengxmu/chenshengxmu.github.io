* The iPad A5X processor with quad core graphics was confirmed today at Apple’s new iPad media event.
* When comparing to competitors Phile Schiller said: “The Apple A5 was already twice as fast. This is a graphics powerhouse.”
* Seeing that the current A5 chip inside the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2 is no slouch, it’s insane to think of how much horsepower is behind this chip. It should have no problem keeping the new Retina Display satisfied…

* Look at those stats? Can you imagine playing Infinity Blade 3 on this thing?
* Note: As stated in the headline, these are quad core graphics, meaning a quad core GPU. It’s still a dual core CPU.
