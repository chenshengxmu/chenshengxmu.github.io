* Alongside its release of WatchKit, Apple has posted the first beta of iOS 8.2 to developers. The update brings about support for the new Apple Watch developer tools, and can be downloaded either over the air, or directly from the dev center, by any registered iOS developer.
* Interestingly enough, the beta release comes just one day after Apple pushed out iOS 8.1.1 to the masses, which had only been in testing itself for a few weeks. That’s quite the turnaround time when you consider that Apple sometimes waits several months between iOS releases.
* We’re not sure what changes 8.2 includes outside of WatchKit support, but we’re installing the beta now and will pass along anything notable. If you see something we’ve missed, feel free to email us at tips@idownloadblog.com or leave a note down in the comments section below.
* The Apple Watch is expected to launch in spring of 2015, with a starting price of $349.
