* As promised earlier this morning, Apple has now released the OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite software update for public consumption. It comes with the long-expected Photos app replacing iPhoto as the default consumer photo-management solution on Macs.
* Other new features in the 1.52-gigabyte update include 300 new emoji with racially diverse designs, improvements to Wi-Fi networking, bug fixes, performance improvements and more. The software is available via the Mac App Store’s Updates tab.
* The update also brings Spotlight suggestions to Yosemite’s Look Up feature, fixes Bluetooth issues causing some devices to disconnect and improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.
* You’re wholeheartedly encouraged to back up your Mac using Time Machine or a third-party solution before installing OS X 10.10.3, just in case something goes wrong.
* The full changelog, as per Apple:

* This update also includes the following improvements:
* Enterprise content
* More information about this update, including detailed information about the security content of OS X 10.10.3, is available in Apple’s support doc.
* Photos for Mac sports professional-level and advanced fine-tuning tools such as granular color correction. And if you use iCloud Photo Library, the app will store all your photos and videos in the cloud in their original resolution.
* You can then elect to download full-resolution or device-optimized content on a per-device basis in Settings > iCloud > Photos. With iCloud Photo Library enabled, your edits and other changes made to photos instantly sync between all your devices.
* This includes deleting a photo or video, which automatically removes copies from both the cloud and all your synced devices. Thankfully, you have about a month to retrieve delete content from the cloud should you change your mind.
* Apple gives each free iCloud account five gigabytes of storage, with paid tiers available at 20GB/200GB/500GB/1TB for $0.99/$3.99/$9.99/$19.99 per month.
* In addition to OS X 10.10.3 update, the company also posted the OS X Yosemite Recovery Update 1.0 which improves the reliability of Yosemite Recovery when restoring from a Time Machine backup.
