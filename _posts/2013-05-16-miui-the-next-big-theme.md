* A few days ago, we were contacted by one of the developers of a jailbreak theme I had never heard of before called iMIUI. In the email they told us that we just had to check out their theme, saying it could be the next ayecon.
* Given that Surenix’s ayecon theme is easily the most popular in the jailbreak community right now, that’s a pretty bold statement. But after using iMIUI over the past few days, I’m starting to think they might just be right…
* First things first, what is iMIUI? Well from what I understand, MIUI is an Android ROM, built by the folks over at Xiaomi Tech. And iMIUI is a large-scale iOS port of that ROM, wrapped up in the form of a WinterBoard theme.

* I say large-scale port because this thing is huge. It has icons for every stock app, and several third party ones. And it replaces a number of UI elements like the Lock screen, the Status bar, the dialer, etc. It’s extremely extensive.
* Perhaps more impressive, though, are the little touches. Blue accents have been replaced by Orange ones. And both radio buttons and toggles seem a bit more soft around the edges. I must say, the level of detail here is striking.
* But above all else, iMIUI is just a really good-looking theme. The icons, which are the most important part of a theme, look excellent. They’re crisp, they’re understated, and very well designed. And the same goes for the various UI tweaks.

* So, should you install iMIUI? Yes. Even if you don’t keep it, it’s definitely one of the few themes I believe is worth checking out. Is it the next ayecon? I don’t know about all of that. But it does have one major thing going for it: It’s free.
* To install the theme, you’ll have to add http://cydia.myrepospace.com/imiui/ to your Cydia sources by tapping Manage > Sources > Edit > Add. It’s iOS 6 and iPhone 5-friendly, but at the moment there’s no iPad version available.
* Ok, what do you guys think of iMIUI?
