* As we just told you, the evad3rs have released a new jailbreak tool called evasi0n7, and it allows you to easily jailbreak iOS 7. The good news is that the hack works with all flavors of iOS 7, which includes iOS 7.0.1, iOS 7.0.2, iOS 7.0.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.5, and 7.0.6. (no jailbreak for iOS 7.1 at this time).
* As usual, the evad3rs have made the utility fairly easy to use. But also as usual, we know there will be folks out there looking for a bit of help using it. So we’ve created an easy-to-follow tutorial to show you how to jailbreak iOS 7 on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch…
* Note: Again, this jailbreak is only compatible with compatible with iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini models running iOS 7.0 through 7.0.6. That means it won’t work on the Apple TV or any devices running iOS 6.0. Also, you’ll want to make sure that you backup your device using iCloud or iTunes. We don’t anticipate any issues, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
* Update: for those of you having issues, the evad3rs have provided a possible resolution:
* If you OTA updated your device, back it up in iTunes and make a FULL restore before applying evasi0n7. http://t.co/K3W0il1cNN #iOS7JB

* Step 1: Download evasi0n7 for Mac via our downloads page, and extract the package. Make sure you download the latest version available.
* Step 2: Double click the evasi0n7 app to run it.
* Step 3: If your device has a passcode set, unlock your device and go to Settings > General > Passcode Lock > and select Turn Passcode Off.
* Step 4: Plug in your iDevice to your computer, and wait for evasi0n to recognize it.
* Step 5: You should see a message on the tool that it has detected your device, and the Jailbreak button should become clickable.

* Step 6: You’ll then click that button, and sit back while the app does its thing.
* Step 6: Finally, you’ll be asked to tap the evasi0n7 icon on your device’s Home screen
* And that’s all there is to it. The entire process takes around 5 minutes, and your device will reboot a few times. If the process gets stuck at any point, it’s safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home), and rerun the process.
* It’s worth restating that Saurik was caught by surprise, as we all were, with this release, so he hasn’t had the chance to test things out yet. As such, we imagine you’ll run into issues with both Cydia and your favorite tweaks, so be prepared for initial compatibility issues.
* Anyway, if you have questions, concerns, or comments, then please leave your feedback in the comment section below. Please be willing to help your fellow jailbreakers as you’ve been so eager to do so in the past. Windows users can click here for a separate tutorial.
