* Among the headline new Mac features set to debut when OS X Mavericks gets released this Fall is a little but important enhancement to Dictation.
* Hawk-eyed readers will recall that Dictation was brought to the Mac as part of OS X Mountain Lion last summer. Based on Siri’s speech-to-text component, Dictation on the Mac requires a broadband Internet connection.
* In Mavericks, Apple will let you optionally download a nearly 1GB package to power offline Dictation.
* But Apple’s engineers aren’t stopping here and are reportedly privately testing offline Dictation for iOS 7. More details right after the break…
* The discovery was made by Hamza Sood and first reported by Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac.
* Although Apple’s iOS 7 web page makes no mention of offline Dictation, Hamza spotted code references in both iOS 7 betas (but not in iOS 6).
* The functionality is currently not active in public-facing builds, but we are told that devices internal to Apple have the function up and running.
* We are also told that while local Dictation is an option in these seeds, the former, cloud-based Dictation process is present for certain situations. Perhaps this will be an option in Settings or an option based on Internet conditions.
* We can only speculate as to whether offline Dictation might be an iPhone 5S exclusive.
* Such a move wouldn’t be unheard-of. Remember, Siri debuted in October 2011 as an iPhone 4S exclusive before eventually being rolled to the fifth-generation iPod touch and iPad 3 and 4 and iPad mini.

* It remains to be seen whether the current iPhone 5 has enough oomph to carry out on-device speech-to-text conversion. Battery life is an obvious concern here as tapping the Dictation database weighing several hundred megabytes would prove a major burden on resources.
* Here’s a demo of live Dictation in OS X Mavericks.
* Potential benefits of offline Dictation on iDevices are obvious.
* First and foremost, such a capability would enable live feedback when using your voice to input text using Dictation. You’d also avoid unwanted data usage over the cellular network, always a big concern when on a metered plan.
* The offline Dictation database could even help Siri  respond instantly to certain queries, like setting your alarms, turning on flashlight and performing other functions that don’t require web sources.

* All told, we’re pretty sure offline Dictation is coming to iOS devices, this way or another.
* Back in November, reliable sources told Gurman that Apple would bring both Siri and native Maps app to the Mac. The latter came true as OS X Mavericks includes a standalone Maps application.
* Siri, on the other, is a no show in Mavericks.
* There’s no reason to suspect Siri won’t make a leap to the Mac just as we’re all but certain that offline Dictation will at some point surface as an option on certain iOS 7 devices.
