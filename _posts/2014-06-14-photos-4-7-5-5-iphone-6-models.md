* Some new photos of alleged iPhone 6 models surfaced this morning, courtesy of Sonny Dickson. We’ve seen several photos of physical mockups to date, but these by far offer the best representation of what Apple’s next smartphone is expected to look like.
* It’s believed that the iPhone 6 will come in two display sizes: 4.7 and 5.5-inches, and today’s images show the two variants sitting side by side. This not only give us a good idea of the handset’s design, but it also indicates how the two models will vary in size…

* Again, these physical mockups matchup with pretty much all of the evidence and component leaks we’ve seen thus far. You can see the relocated power button, the elongated volume buttons, and the thick, controversial antenna breaks on the rear shell.
* In addition to the new hardware design, and larger displays, the next iPhone is expected to feature a higher resolution panel, sapphire screen cover, a faster processor and various other improvements. The 4.7-inch version could launch as early as September.
* While we’re at it, 9to5Mac has posted photos of a Space Gray iPhone 6 model:

* As usual, we won’t know for sure what the iPhone 6 looks like until Tim Cook or another Apple executive hoists it up on stage this fall. But with so much evidence pointing to one distinct design, it’s hard to imagine it looking drastically different than this.
