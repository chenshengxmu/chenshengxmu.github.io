* A second-generation AirPods will launch in the fourth quarter of 2019, Barclays claims, contradicting an earlier report from Bloomberg which predicted AirPods 2 with an improved Apple W2 wireless chip and built-in Hey Siri support would release this year.
* Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis and his associates are basing their latest prediction on the information gathered while traveling across Asia last week.
* “AirPods 2 will launch in the fourth quarter of 2019,” reads Barclays’ note to clients obtained by MacRumors. “Meanwhile, an optional wireless charging case for the original AirPods, and Apple’s new AirPower charging mat, will be available this September,” adds the report.
* Bloomberg also reported a September launch for AirPower.

* Apple has publicly announced that it will also release a long-delayed wireless charging case for AirPods that many people believe is almost guaranteed to work without issues with any Qi-certified charging mat, not just with Apple’s upcoming AirPower device.
* The multi-device Qi charger may cost just $149.
* Bloomberg also predicted that Apple would release a water-resistant AirPods upgrade some time this year while introducing an all-new premium on-ear headphone model in 2019.
