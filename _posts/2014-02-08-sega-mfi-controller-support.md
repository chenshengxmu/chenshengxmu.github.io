* It got off to a rocky start, but things are looking up for Apple’s MFi controller platform. We’re starting to see more (and cheaper) controller options become available for iOS devices, and developers are adding MFi support to their games daily.
* Case in point, Sega just updated 2 of its most popular Sonic iOS titles with MFi controller support. Now in addition to Sonic the Hedgehog 2, both the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic CD are compatible with the new breed of gamepads…
* If you haven’t played either of these titles yet, I recommend that you check them out. Although both have been out for a while, they were remastered by the talented Christian Whitehead last year to offer superior graphics and faster frame rates.

* In fact, about the only caveat for these games was the on-screen controls, which were tough for some folks to get the hang of and at times, obstructed your view. But now that you can play them with a physical controller, that’s no longer an issue.
* If you’re interested, you can find both Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic CD in the App Store for $2.99 each. And if you’re looking for other games that feature MFi controller support, be sure to check out our most recent MFi title list by clicking here.
