* Take this one with a huge grain of salt, but TechCrunch is reporting that it’s received leaked shots of a “light version of the iPhone 4.” These pictures of what looks very much like a jailbroken iPhone 4 come from Tinhte, and TechCrunch makes the point that Tinhte got a white iPhone 4 prototype right with a leaked video back in April.
* This iPhone 4 prototype is made of a cheaper build quality, and it matches up pretty well with a couple iPhone 5 case leaks that we reported on yesterday. However, the device doesn’t seem to be any smaller than the current iPhone 4…
* “What we’re seeing is an iPhone 4 without front and back glass panels. Instead, there are two translucent plastic sheets and metal banding around the edge. This would make the iPhone considerably cheaper to build.”
* Tinhte was the first site to get its hands on an iPod touch with a front facing camera, and that was back in May of 2010— months before Apple introduced an iPod touch with two cameras. The Vietnamese site also leaked a MacBook model before Apple announced it in 2010.

* As you can tell, the identification numbers on the back of this alleged prototype have been X’ed out. We’re assuming that this hints at its authenticity as a legit prototype model.
* Not much is different in this purposed iPhone Lite, but it’s interesting to note that the device has been jailbroken.
* To echo Cult of Mac’s opinion, we have to think that this could just be a cheap conversion kit applied to the iPhone 4. There’s no real proof of the difference in build quality, so it’s difficult to give it a vote of confidence— even with Tinhte’s track record. Hopefully, if Apple does introduce an iPhone ‘Nano’ or ‘Lite’, the device will actually look different from the current iPhone 4.

* Apple tests tons of different future iPhone prototypes before a product hits the market. This is typical practice, and Apple has been doing it for years. You don’t get such a well thought out product like the iPhone without a long list of failed prototypes that came before it. This alleged iPhone ‘Lite’ device could just be a failed experiment.
* What do you think about this “leak?”
