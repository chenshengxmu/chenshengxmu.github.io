* Launching a week from today, a new Apple Watch variant created in partnership with Nike pairs a Space Gray Apple Watch Series 2 aluminum case with a strap featuring a new creamy color and black perforations (they’re calling this color combo “Light Bone”). Marketed as Apple Watch NikeLab, this limited-edition version of the wearable device will be available on nike.com, at NikeLab doors and at an Apple Tokyo popup store in Isetan beginning next Thursday, April 27.
* NikeLab models will be available in 38mm and 42mm options, respectively priced at $369 and $399 like your regular Series 2 models. I’m not sure if you can discern it from the hero shot top of post, but the NikeLab Innovation x Innovators logo appears on the inside of the strap.
* Like prior Nike+ variants of Apple Watch, the new NikeLab edition is being positioned as “the ultimate style companion” for those with a passion for running.
* ROUNDUP: 5 inexpensive alternatives to Apple Watch Nike+ straps
* Aside from a special combination of straps/colors/materials along with deep integration with the Nike+ Run Club app and a few exclusive Siri commands, this is your regular Apple Watch Series 2 will all the features you’ve come to love: built-in GPS, water resistance up to 50 meters, a faster S2 chip and a lot brighter screen than its predecessor’s.

* Curiously enough, these new NikeLab variants won’t be offered in Apple’s own retail stores or through the company’s online store, which is definitely a first for the wrist-worn device.
* Apple’s been collaborating with Nike on various initiatives since the iPod days.
* After launching two Apple Watch Nike+ models in Silver and Space Gray last September, Apple this spring made the exclusive Apple Watch Nike+ straps available standalone.
* Previously, you had to opt for an Apple Watch Nike+ if you wanted one of those wonderfully executed bands in Nike’s signature colors.
