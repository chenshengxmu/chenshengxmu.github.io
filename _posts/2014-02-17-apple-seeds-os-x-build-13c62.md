* Apple has seeded the seventh OS X 10.9.2 beta to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The last few betas have each come about a week apart, but this one comes less than a week after beta 6.
* The new build is available to all registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what specific changes are coming in the update, but Apple has asked developers to focus on Mail, Messages, graphics drivers, VoiceOver feature support, VPN and SMB2.
* The first beta, released in December, added support for FaceTime Audio in Messages and FaceTime apps. Today’s build is labeled as 13C62, and we’ll be sure to let you know if it offers anything new.
