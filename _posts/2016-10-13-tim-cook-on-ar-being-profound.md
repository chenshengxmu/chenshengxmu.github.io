* Apple CEO Tim Cook once again sings the praises of augmented reality in a new interview with BuzzFeed News. Cook tells the outlet that his team is “high on AR in the long run” and he believes the technology can be “huge.”
* His latest comments echo those from previous interviews, including one from August with The Washington Post. He said at that time that Apple is very bullish on AR and is doing a lot of things with the tech behind the curtain.
* From today’s BuzzFeed interview:
* “There’s no substitute for human contact,” Cook told BuzzFeed News. “And so you want the technology to encourage that.” It’s not the first time Cook has indicated that Apple might favor AR. “We are high on AR for the long run,” Cook said during an earnings call this past summer. “I think AR can be huge.” Huge, indeed — one could look to the sudden and explosive success of Pokemon Go to see an immediate real-world example.
* […] “VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,” Cook explained. “Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.”
* There’s a stack of evidence to back up Cook’s claims that Apple is betting big on AR, including high profile hirings, acquisitions and patent applications. And given how hot VR is right now, it’ll be interesting to see how this unfolds.
