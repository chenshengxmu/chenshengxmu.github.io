* When I first heard about SmoothCursor, I didn’t imagine that it would have much of an effect on the typing experience. While it’s true that it doesn’t have any real bearing on the actual input process, it definitely has a noticeable look from a visual standpoint.
* SmoothCursor borrows the same cursor movement popularized by Microsoft Office. Instead of a cursor with well-defined keyframes of animation, the cursor features smoothly animated motion as you type. 
* Describing SmoothCursor doesn’t do it the justice it deserves, so be sure to watch the video above to see the difference between the cursor without SmoothCursor installed versus after SmoothCursor is installed. I think you’ll find that the difference is stark.
* I personally think that SmoothCursor is an awesome little tweak that makes a big difference when it comes to cursor animation. For that reason, I think I’m going to keep it installed on my daily driver.
* SmoothCuror is available for free on the BigBoss repo, and once you install it, it just starts working. What do you think about it?
