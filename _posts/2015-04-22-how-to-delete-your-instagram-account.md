* A few days ago, I decided that I was going to get rid of my Instagram account, and that’s what I did. I felt that it was just another app that served as a distraction to my daily workflow, so it had to go. Even though I had over 2,000 followers, I was ready to make this change.
* Have you ever considered deleting your account? Although deleting an Instagram account is easy, it’s not as straightforward as just opening the app, going to your account details, and tapping delete. In this post, I’ll show you how to delete your Instagram account.
* Understand that deleting your IG account is permanent and cannot be undone. Proceed with caution.
* Step 1: In a web browser, navigate to the Delete Your Account page. You’ll need to login with your Instagram username and password if you’re not already logged in.
* Step 2: Select a reason why you’re deleting your account and verify your password. You will not see the delete button until you choose a reason and re-enter your password.
* Step 3: Once you meet the aforementioned requirements, click the Permanently delete my account button to delete your Instagram account.
* Note: Yes, I actually deleted my 2,000 follower account that I’ve had for several years and all of the emotional memories that went along with it. I did this because creating a fake account just to delete it wouldn’t be nearly as fun or emotionally taxing. And without doing so, I wouldn’t have been able to write this post.
* Do I regret my decision? Part of me is already missing some of the memories that I shared via that account, but I have a greater sense of relief than anything else. There’s so many things vying for my time on a day-to-day basis, and to have one less thing to maintain is kind of nice.
