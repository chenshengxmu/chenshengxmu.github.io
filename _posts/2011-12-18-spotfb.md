* Spotfb is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to launch different sections of the official Facebook app by means of predefined Spotlight commands.
* All you need to do is swipe over to your Spotlight page, type the command, and tap return. It’ll then launch the specific Facebook page that pertains to the command that you typed.
* Honestly, we’re not sure who would be willing to use such a tweak; it’d be much faster to just launch the app and venture to your desired section, wouldn’t it?
* Perhaps there’s somebody out there that’s being dying for such troublesome functionality? If that’s the case, then they’ll be happy to know that Spotfb is a free download on Cydia for jailbroken iPhones.
* It will require you to have the official Facebook app installed on your device, and you can acquire a full list of commands by typing “Spotfb help” without quotes in your Spotlight search.
* Would you use this?
