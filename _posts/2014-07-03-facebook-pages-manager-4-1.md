* Nearly two weeks after giving its Pages Manager app for the iPhone and iPad a much-needed iOS 7 overhaul, the social networking giant Facebook last night issued another update adding a couple new capabilities for page admins.
* The latest Facebook Pages Manager 4.1 update expands on the app’s feature set with photos and tagged Pages in comments, direct sharing from your Page, location in your posts and more…
* The update also includes support for an additional eight languages, including Czech, Danish, Finnish, Greek and Malay.
* All new features in this update include the following:
* In addition to iOS 7 styling, the previous 4.0 update has made it easy to edit posts on your device, reply directly to commenters with threaded conversations and more.
* Download Facebook Pages Manager free in the App Store.
* iOS 7.0 or later is required.
