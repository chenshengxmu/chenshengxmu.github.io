* The Wall Street Journal is reporting that iPhone will feature a flexible screen based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology and supplant Lightning with USB-C.
* The story corroborates KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo’s claims that Apple will release three new phones this year in the form of the brand new OLED-based iPhone 8 model with refreshed industrial design and the more iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates.
* “Apple Inc. has decided to adopt a flexible display for one model of the new iPhone coming out this year and has ordered sufficient components to enable mass production,” people familiar with the matter said.
* WSJ refers to iPhone 8 as “10th Anniversary Edition”, but it’s unclear if it’ll be marketed under that moniker. The story says iPhone 8 has a “USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of Apple’s original Lightning connector”.
* As you know, Apple switched from the 30-pin Dock connector to Lightning I/O for iOS devices with the release of iPhone 5 in 2012. The twelve-inch MacBook was the first Apple computer to use the new USB-C standard. 2016 MacBook Pro models dropped all legacy USB ports for USB-C, creating something of a controversy.

* I find it difficult to believe that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector for a bulkier USB-C just a few short years after adopting Lightning.
* Another possibility: iPhone 8 could retain Lightning and ship with a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box so that the phone could be charged from USB-C-outfitted Mac computers and wall chargers right out of the box.
* It’s a far fetched rumor, that much is clear, especially with the Magic accessories, AirPods and BeatsX earphones all featuring a Lightning port for charging.
* On the other hand, USB-C is becoming an industry standard across smartphones and many other devices so there’s that.
* What do you guys think?
