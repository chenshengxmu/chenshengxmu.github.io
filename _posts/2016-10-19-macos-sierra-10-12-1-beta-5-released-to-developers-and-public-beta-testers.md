* Aside from releasing a fifth beta of iOS 10.1 with Portrait mode and other changes, Apple also seeded a fifth beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 to its registered developers and public beta testers. The new beta arrived eight days following the previous macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 4 release.
* macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta 5 (build “16B2553a”) does not introduce any new outward-facing user features. The Mac software update could release for public consumption after Apple’s anticipated October 27 Mac event.
* The latest build of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 is available as an over-the-air update through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab or via the Software Update mechanism on Macs that run a prior beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1.
* macOS Sierra 10.12.1 includes support for a built-in Portrait album in the Photos app which holds shots captured using the iPhone 7 Plus’s bokeh photography mode.
