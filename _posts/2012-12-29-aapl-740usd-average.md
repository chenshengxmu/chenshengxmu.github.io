* All of the concerns voiced about the impending leap off the ‘fiscal cliff’ and its associated increase in capital gains taxes on stock sales have sent Wall Street into a tizzy. The end result: knocking Apple’s target share price down to $740. Nearly a dozen analysts have cut their target price for Apple stock amid talk that the iPhone maker has a dodgy future, what with supply questions hanging over the executives at One Infinity Loop. Despite all the rain clouds, the $740 per share target price reduction is about $225 more than Friday’s opening on Wall Street…
* According to a chart of analyst forecasts by Philip Elmer-DeWitt over at Fortune, there are holdouts from the $740 outlook. Leading the pack is Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets.
* White has a price target of $1,111 for Apple shares. He continues to recommend the stock as a “Buy.” Then there are others who believe Apple’s salad days are gone.
* Peter Misek of Jefferies sees Apple’s future in chasing emerging markets, such as China and India, where mobile consumers are starting to adopt smartphones like the iPhone en masse.
* If you type “sell” into Google Finance, you’ll get Apple’s stock info.Is Google… goo.gl/BriZ2

* Earlier this month, Misek made news by predicting Apple will unveil a new iPhone in June or July of 2013, returning to its usual mid-year schedule for product announcements. But along the way, he told investors the price for smartphones has likely peaked and he trimmed his target price for AAPL shares to $800.

* High-profile Apple watchers such as Gene Munster of Piper Jeffray or Sterne Agee’s Shaw Wu also missed the down elevator. Munster has a $900 price target, while Wu isn’t far behind at $840 for Apple.
* Although a number of analysts trimmed their price targets for Apple, only two of the 11 Wall Street observers recommended investors sell their AAPL shares. The majority of analysts retained a “Buy” recommendation – or even “Outperform.”
* If analysts were teenagers and Apple was heartthrob Justin Bieber, I would suggest the questions surrounding the iPad maker was just a phase. masse When Apple announces its next ‘album,’ Wall Street will be one of the first in line.
