* With iPhone X now in the hands of eager customers, many of the popular apps and games have been updated with support for the features that are exclusive to iPhone X, like the Face ID facial recognition system, the notch, the high-resolution Super Retina display and more.
* While this is by no means an all-inclusive list of iPhone X-optimized apps and games, our own Andrew O’Hara has decided to take it upon himself to test for you guys how some of the best-known apps and games look and feel on Apple’s latest flagship phone.

* Andrew’s favorites are as follows:
* Google has begun updating its most popular apps with iPhone X support, too.
* YouTube for iOS, for instance, was updated this morning with fullscreen support on iPhone X (when watching a video in fullscreen mode, pinch zoom to fill up the entire screen).
