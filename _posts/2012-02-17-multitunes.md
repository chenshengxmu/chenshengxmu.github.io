* Whenever I hear of a jailbreak app that somehow alters the iTunes syncing experience, a red flag goes up. I guess it was one bad experience I had when I was new to jailbreaking a few years ago that keeps me on guard whenever anything wants to touch my music.
* Needless to say, I downloaded MultiTunes and decided to give it a try anyway. What I found was an awesome tweak that works just as advertised. With MultiTunes, you can sync multiple iTunes libraries on your iPhone with ease…
* MultiTunes is extremely simple in its layout and design, and that’s one of the things that put me at easy as I began using it. It really can’t get any simpler than this.
* You have a “Default Library” and the option to add additional libraries using a ‘+’ button in the upper right-hand corner of the app. Adding a new library requires you to give it a name and nothing more.
* Once you create a library, you can instantly switch between them by tapping on your library of choice. Literally, that’s all it takes; simply tap on the library you want to switch to, and MultiTunes handles the rest.
* After switching to a new library, open the Music app, and you’ll notice that it is now empty, and ready to be synced with iTunes. You can sync other libraries in your household with ease, and it even appears (though I wasn’t able to test it completely) that it may work for syncing iTunes Match libraries as well. There’s still some doubts as to how that would exactly work with multiple logins and the sort, but I was able to sync my own iTunes Match library more than once.
* Even the ability to sync multiple libraries not in the cloud is a pretty big deal, and MultiTunes handles it all flawlessly. The only thing you really have to be aware of is making sure that you’re on your default library when syncing apps and things of that nature. MultiTunes, as its name suggests, is primarily geared towards music.
* Honestly, I can’t believe an app of this quality and ease of use is free of charge, but it is. If you want to give it a try, head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Please make sure to relate your experience in the comment section below after using it.
