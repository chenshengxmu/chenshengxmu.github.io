* Earlier this week we talked about 3DBoard, which is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that adds a 3D effect to your iPhone’s Home screen. DeepEnd works in a similar way, altering your wallpaper’s orientation based on movement.
* DeepEnd is from a staple in the jailbreak app community, and one of our favorite developers, Ryan Petrich — the same guy behind ActionMenu.
* Want to see how DeepEnd works in action? Check out our video inside as we explore this nifty looking jailbreak tweak…
* At stock settings, the effect, while present, isn’t as pronounced as one might expect; but that’s nothing a quick adjustment of the Zoom, Pitch, and Roll in the settings section of the Settings.app won’t remedy.

* I actually prefer the subtlety of the stock settings, but if you’re looking for some real eye-popping effects, you’re going to want to turn things up.
* All in all, DeepEnd is a pretty good jailbreak tweak; it does exactly what it says it does, and on top of that it’s free on Cydia for jailbroken iPhones on Ryan’s repo. Just add: http://rpetri.ch/repo/ to your ‘Sources’ in Cydia via the ‘Manage’ tab.
* Since this tweak does indeed use the gyroscope, it’s for iPhone 4 only.
* What do you think about DeepEnd?
