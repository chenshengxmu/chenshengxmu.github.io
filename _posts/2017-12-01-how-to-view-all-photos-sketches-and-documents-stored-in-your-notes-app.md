* Not too long ago we highlighted the sometimes overlooked ability to pin your notes in iOS 11. In the same vein, Notes has been updated with another low-key tab that can greatly upvalue the app experience.
* If you know where to look, you can pull up a dedicated view for all attachments embedded into Notes, arranged by file type and date for quick access and extraction.
* The use for such feature should not require a lot of explaining, so let’s dive straight into the how:
* 1) For the most part, this trick is as straightforward as it will ever get. Open Notes and select a Folder such as your iCloud Notes.

* 2) Looking at the list view of all compiled notes, touch the bottom left icon made up of four little squares.

* 3) You’ve entered the place where attachments go to mingle. In here you’ll be able to backtrace all pictures, sketches and documents attached to a note in your Notes folders.
* 4) You can now swipe horizontally through the galleries or hit Show All in the corner of each rubric. Hit it to get to the mosaic view of all items.
* For demonstration purposes I’m going to pick Photos and Videos.

* 5) Finally, once you have identified the image you have been desperate to find, just expand the shot and look to the top right for your Show in Note link. Easy as!

* If you haven’t checked the feature yet, by all accounts pop open Notes and have a look around! And while you’re at it, this is also an expedient place to go if you feel like cleansing your Notes app from older, space-hogging files (that you probably even weren’t aware of in the first place).
* So there, more than one good reason to give it a go today!
