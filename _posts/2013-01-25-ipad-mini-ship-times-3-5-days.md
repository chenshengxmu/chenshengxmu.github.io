* During Apple’s earnings call earlier this week, Tim Cook noted that the iPad mini was constrained for most of the holiday quarter. And he was right, estimated shipping times were as high as a month in November, and still a week out in December.
* But it looks like Apple’s supply is catching up with demand. Today, for the first time, those estimates have dropped below a week. In the United States, in Canada, and several other countries, Apple’s web store is showing ship times of just 3-5 days…
* First spotted by iPhoneincanada, the shorter ship times are being reported online in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Japan. Unfortunately, it looks like the UK store and others in Europe are still showing 2 weeks.
* Apple unveiled the iPad mini back in October last year after months of rumors and speculation. The tablet’s smaller size has proven to be a hit with customers; it sold out within 72 hours of launch and helped Apple sell 3 million iPads during its first weekend.
* The only real gripe about the device has been its lack of a Retina display. And if recent supply chain chatter is any indication, that’s Apple’s number one priority for the next-generation slate. The iPad mini 2 is expected to arrive in October alongside the iPad 5.
