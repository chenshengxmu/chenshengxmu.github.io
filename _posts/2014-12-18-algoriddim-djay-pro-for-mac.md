* German developer Algoriddim on Thursday completed its suite of apps for DJs by releasing djay Pro for Mac. Building on djay 2 for the iPhone and iPad, the Pro edition brings 4-deck support and the full power of Algoriddim’s low-latency mixing engine.
* The app has some rather advanced features such as Spotify and iTunes integration, support for professional DJ hardware, high-definition waveforms, audio effects, meta data and FX purchases from iOS versions of djay and much more.
* Jump past the fold for the full overview of djay Pro for Mac.
* For starters, djay Pro is the first DJ software on the desktop with Spotify integration, giving DJs access to over 20 million tracks instantly. On the iOS side, Pacemaker in February 2014 became the first DJ app to integrate with Spotify, prompting Algoriddim to bring Spotiffy integration to its djay 2 for iOS three months later.
* Here’s a promotional video.
* Built exclusively for OS X, djay Pro takes full advantage of the desktop’s computing power including 64-bit processing, multi-core track analysis, support for Retina and 5K displays, graphics rendering at 60 frames per second and pristine sound quality.
* The app supports a range of pro DJ hardware out of the box, including over 50 MIDI controllers by Pioneer, Numark, Reloop and other manufacturers. In addition, an advanced MIDI Learn system allows you to map each hardware control on your device to individual actions in djay Pro and customize the setup to your liking.
* A turntable view, seen below, renders true record grooves on the virtual vinyl along with the song’s cover artwork.

* The app sports a powerful four-deck view that allows DJs to play, mix and synchronize up to four tracks simultaneously. This lets you beat-synchronize and chain multiple effect units on up to four decks simultaneously. Check out the four deck support in vertical orientation below.
