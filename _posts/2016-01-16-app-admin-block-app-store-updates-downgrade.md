The headlining new feature is the ability to block App Store updates, which allows you to easily keep downgraded apps installed on your iOS device.

* Blocking updates for an app allows you to keep automatic updates enabled, yet still maintain select downgraded apps. This is a solid update, and it makes App Admin even better than it was before.
* What do you think?
