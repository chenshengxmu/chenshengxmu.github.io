* It’s Apple patent time again here at iDownloadbBlog, and the latest to be discovered by Patently Apple points to a fancy new iTunes based diagnostic tool for iOS devices.
* The new tool will create and monitor in-depth change logs, as well as check things like the device’s location and other physical conditions. The idea is that the logs show what a device was doing and where it was doing it at definable points in time. The patent mentions the logs could be generated at every restart, every day, or every time a particular action is performed…
* “The log may be generated periodically (e.g., every 5 milliseconds, every 30 minutes, every 5 hours, after every reset, or at any other time based or event based or environment based event occurs). Each generated log may be stored on the Apple device or uploaded to a remote entity, and each log may be retained or overwritten by a more recently generated log depending on available storage space and/or processing capabilities, for example.”
* As anyone who’s ever visit an Apple Genius Bar will attest, the more information the better, and no doubt Apple employees would love to have a tool like this at their disposal. Perhaps in conjunction with, I don’t know, a web based diagnostic tool?
* We told you just yesterday of an Apple project that could see iOS devices be repaired remotely, using a unique ticket number that could be emailed to an iDevice owner by an Apple Genius. Saving a trip to a busy Apple Store is always a good thing, and if you’re anything like us, it could well save you money, too!
* These two diagnostic tools could change the way we get iDevice help in the future, with the problem being detected by a detailed log file, and repaired remotely by a Genius. As with all patent applications though, there’s no guarantee this technology will ever see the light of day.
* Would you rather have your iDevice problems repaired remotely, or do you love the smell of an Apple Store in the morning?
