* Apple’s long-awaited WWDC keynote is now in full swing, and as usual, CEO Tim Cook has taken the stage to kick things off. Cook began on a somber note, asking attendees to participate in a moment of silence for the victims of yesterday’s tragedy in Orlando, and then got down to business rattling off new stats.
* Among the most interesting numbers the executive shared is that the App Store recently surpassed 2 million apps. In the most recent data Apple shared on app numbers, it was still around the 1.5 million mark, so this is a new development for sure. We’ve got some other interesting numbers for you listed below.
