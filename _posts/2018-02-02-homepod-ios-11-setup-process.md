* Additional HomePod details are trickling in ahead of its scheduled February 9 launch.
* The Verge notes that an iOS 11-capable Apple device is required for the setup process.
* This isn’t surprising.
* As we learned recently, HomePod owners will be using Apple’s stock HomePod app to set up their smart speaker, adjust its settings, install HomePod software updates and more.
* HomePod supports Apple’s Automatic Setup process where you bring your iPhone near the speaker to transfer common settings, like Wi-Fi passwords, Siri settings and more.

* Automatic Setup uses Bluetooth for proximity information..
* But as we reported today, this doesn’t mean that HomePod can be used as a standalone Bluetooth speaker because Bluetooth isn’t a supported audio source, according to Apple’s Tech Specs webpage for the device, even though the smart speaker has onboard Bluetooth 5.0.
* As a result, Apple Music subscribers with Android phones are seemingly out of luck, not only because HomePod doesn’t support Bluetooth audio streaming but also considering Apple doesn’t support AirPlay on Android.
