* Good news, Apple TV users: later today, HBO will enable AirPlay streaming in its HBO Go iOS app. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal-sponsored D: Dive Into Media conference on Tuesday, HBO’s Eric Kessler said that “effective today, we will be enabling AirPlay” for HBO Go. Bloomberg last month reported that Apple and HBO are working on a content deal.
* He also re-iterated that HBO Go will eventually land on the Apple TV later this yeare. Until the Apple TV app materializes, Time Warner Inc.’s HBO Go subscribers can use the existing iOS app to stream HBO shows from their iPhone or iPad to their Apple TV over AirPlay…
* AirPlay streaming has been added as an update to the HBO GO iOS app and for Cinemax’s MAX GO app.

* By the way, jailbreakers can use the UnrestrictPremium tweak to watch video via AirPlay mirroring or HDMI output, even if the developer of the app restricts users from doing so. Yes, it works with apps like Amazon Instant Video, DirectTV and HBO Go.
* HBO wants to be on all platforms, Kessler told AllThingsD.
* Our long-term goal for Go is to be on all devices all platforms.
* The app is already available on iOS devices, Microsoft’s Xbox console, the Roku player and some other set-top box devices.
* HBO’s Eric Kessler says goal is not to ever become “your father’s Oldsmobile” #Dmobile

* As for that Bloomberg rumor, the media organization wrote on January 31, 2013 that Apple and HBO are looking to enable the HBO Go app on Apple TV by mid-2013.
* Cable and satellite subscribers who pay for HBO will be able to watch more than 600 hours of films and television shows on Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
* “We will get on Apple TV, as we’ve said all along,” Kessler told AllThingsD.
* HBO Go usage about 2% compared off all HBO viewing, up to 16% for series catch-up says HBO’s Eric Kessler #dmedia
