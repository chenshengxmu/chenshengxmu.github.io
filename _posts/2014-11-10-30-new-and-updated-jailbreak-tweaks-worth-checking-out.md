* With the release of the Pangu jailbreak for both Windows and Mac users, developers have been busy updating their tweaks for iOS 8 and iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, but also releasing new tweaks featuring new features.
* Admittedly, we haven’t been on top of our game covering all these new updates and releases. The sheer volume of these tweaks makes it very hard to have a proper look at everything that us being pushed to Cydia, but we don’t want you to be left out either, so we’ve compiled a list of tweaks that were recently released or updated.
