* As the name suggest, Facebook has launched a brand new iPhone app that allows you to manage Facebook Pages on your iPhone or iPod touch, wherever you go.
* The social networking behemoth bills the program as a way to “help you keep up with your Page and connect with your audience in one place”. We’ve got release notes and nice screenshots…
* You can use this app to post new updates and photos as your Page. This has until now been possible only using the web interface.
* It’ll notify you about new activity on your Page when it happens and lets you respond, post and comment as your Page.
* Another handy capability: the Page Insights feature, allowing you to examine logs and learn more about your audience.
* Here, two more screenies.

* The Facebook Pages Manager app is a free download right from the App Store.
* It’s compatible with the iPhone and iPod touch running iOS 4.2 or higher. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support the iPad natively yet. We sure hope it won’t take a year to make it a universal binary because an app like this begs to be enjoyed on a bigger canvas.
* And while we’re at it, we’d love to see the program merged with Facebook’s iOS client.
* Speaking of Facebook Pages, make sure you like iDB’s Facebook page.
* Hat tip to 9to5Mac for spotting the app early.
