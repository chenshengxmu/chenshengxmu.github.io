* Most of you are probably familiar with the InvisibleSHIELD by Zagg. I’ve done several reviews of these products in the past, and while I don’t like putting screen protectors on my iPhones, I have to admit that I am a huge fan of the InvisibleSHIELD for iPad (read my review for more details).
* I do not put screen protectors or use cases on my iPhones. It’s a matter of principle to me. If Apple went out of its way to design such a beautiful product, I see it is my duty to never alter the look and feel of the product in any way. You can call me crazy, that’s fine.
* This being said, my wife is the complete opposite. Not only she doesn’t care much about the look and feel of her iPhone, but she badly needs a screen protector at all time because she’s kinda careless about her stuff – you would not believe what can happen inside her purse!
* So when the folks at Zagg sent me an InvisibleSHIELD HD for iPhone 4/4S for review, I decided to use it on my wife’s iPhone as she’d be able to tell better than me how well it performs…
* The InvisibleSHIELD HD is the newest addition to Zagg’s family of screen protectors. According to Zagg’s description:
* The invisibleSHIELD HD Maximum Coverage is the perfect marriage of protection and clarity. The application can be more challenging, but our Nano-Memory Technology™ – exclusive to the authentic invisibleSHIELD – lets us squeeze the most possible coverage onto a device and still let it function properly. HD Maximum coverage includes our patented, award-winning invisibleSHIELD® and our exceptionally clear, unbelievably thin, and virtually indestructible HD Screen Coverage. Enjoy premium features like Advanced Clarity and a Glass-Like Surface to accentuate the sharp images and vibrant colors in the newest advanced gadget displays.
* If you’ve used an InvisibleSHIELD before and experienced the orange peel texture, the InvisibleSHIELD HD should fix that.
* As I mentioned above, my wife doesn’t take great care of her iPhone. She just throws it in her purse when going somewhere, without caring if there are keys or other unknown objects in there that could damage it. To her defense, she uses a pretty solid case – the OtterBox Defender – and she already has an InvisibleSHIELD front cover on her iPhone.
* However, this InvisibleSHIELD was over a year old and this poor screen protector wouldn’t have looked any worse if it had gone through the Vietnam war. So when I told her I had a new screen protector for her to try out, she was pretty excited.
* If you’ve installed an InvisibleSHIELD before, you’ll likely remember the installation process is fairly simple and quick.
* First you have to clean up your iPhone, which I did using one of our iDB custom micro fiber cloths. Then make sure your hands are clean, and spray them with the watery solution that comes with your InvisibleSHIELD package.
* Peel out the screen protector from paper backing, spray it with the solution, and apply it to your device. The water based solution is great because if you don’t get the screen protector applied correctly, you can always rearrange it until you got it perfectly set up.
* Once it’s in place, just get rid of the excess water using the tool provided, and try to let your iPhone sit for a few hours so it can start curing. Zagg suggests you don’t use your iPhone for 24 hours, but realistically, who can go 24 hours without using his iPhone? Certainly not my wife, whom as soon as it was installed, grabbed her iPhone, stuck it into her purse, and went on with her day.
* When I asked my wife a couple days later after installing the screen protector what she thought about it, she said it was literally night and day. The orange peel effect she had been experiencing from the beginning on her previous screen protector was nowhere to be found with the InvisibleSHIELD HD.
* She also claims that the screen looks crispier and more responsive to her. Just like that, I became her hero for the day for setting her up with a new screen protector.
* The InvisibleSHIELD HD comes in two flavors. The HD Maximum Coverage will protect the front, back, and the sides. It will set you back $29.99. The other option, the one I used on my wife’s iPhone, is the HD Case Friendly Screen Coverage. It has a slightly smaller size allowing for great protection when using a case that wraps over the screen a little bit such as the Bumper, making sure the case doesn’t peel the sides of the screen protector out.
* If that’s something you’d be interested in, you can buy the InvisibleSHIELD HD from Zagg’s website. Make sure to enter coupon code iDB20 to get 20% off your order at check out.
