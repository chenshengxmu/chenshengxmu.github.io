* Ukrainian developer Readdle today pushed an amazing new update to Documents, a Finder-like app you’ve always wanted that lets you read, listen, view, annotate and organize almost anything you want on your iPad and iPhone.
* Here’s a quick overview of the biggest changes.
* Version 6.3 enhances the app’s built-in PDF reader with the ability to view two pages of a PDF side by side like a book or a magazine, use Sepia or Night modes to read your PDFs with comfort, new options to choose between vertical or horizontal scrolling and more.

* With rethought cloud file management, Documents now lets you add cloud files you use the most to Favorites so they’re easier to find. Your cloud files are now browsable in a thumbnail view and you can finally drag and drop them between cloud services or local folders.

* By the way, Readdle recommends checking your files for metadata information because things like the file size, date of creation, date of last change, location and file format are no longer hidden from your eyes. Another great feature addition is smart MP3 search. With it, people can easily search their songs by metadata, including track title, artist, album name or genre.

* Last but not least, Documents’ built-in media player saw some tweaks as well, like the ability to fast forward or rewind video 10 seconds by double-tapping on the right or left pane.
