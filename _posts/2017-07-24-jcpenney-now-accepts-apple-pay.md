* The United States department store chain JCPenney announced on Monday that it is now accepting Apple Pay at its retail locations nationwide.
* Moreover, the JCPenney credit card is supported by Apple Pay as well, allowing customers to add the card to the Wallet app on their iPhone and earn shopping points and rewards as part of the company’s loyalty program.
* The company’s own iOS app will roll out support for Apple Pay at a later stage.
* JCPenney’s point-of-sale registers now process all Apple Pay supported credit and debit bank cards, including the company’s own credit card and co-branded Mastercard, both issued by Synchrony Bank.
