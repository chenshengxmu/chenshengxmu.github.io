* A new report from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech today claims that the iPhone 4S is responsible for a growth in market share for Apple’s iPhone in both the UK and US, with consumers rushing out to pick up Apple’s latest tech.
* The situation is not quite so rosy in some of Apple’s other European markets, though, with some seeing a reduction in iPhone demand, rather than the usual increase.
* It is better news Down Under, however, with Australia seeing strong iPhone demand and the 4S continuing to “fly off the shelf” as we close in on the end of 2011…
* Apple’s iPhone market share rose to 36% in the US last quarter, up from 25% the year before, and it was a similar story in the UK. Apple finds itself with a 31% of the share in that area, up from 21% the last year.
* The news elsewhere is not quite so positive.
* When looking at market share in France, for example, the stats show a fall from 29% last year to just 20% this time around. Germany’s results are similar – down from 27% to 22%. Both Italy and Spain tell similar stories, a problem that Apple will no doubt be seeking to address as soon as possible.
* Unsurprisingly, Google finds itself the main beneficiary of Apple’s loss, with Android picking up the slack.
* “The fall in Apple’s market share appears to be Google’s gain, with its Android operating system holding shares of between 46% and 61% in all markets that were analysed. German smartphone buyers prefer the Android platform, increasing its market share of the platform to 61%, with Samsung’s Galaxy S II the most popular handset.”
* The reason for the iPhone’s poor showing in some European countries is being attributed to the suffering economies leading purchasers towards being increasingly price-conscious.
