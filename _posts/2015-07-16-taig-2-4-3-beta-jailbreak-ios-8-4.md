* The folks at TaiG have released yet another beta for the iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool on Windows. Labeled version 2.4.3 beta, this update is there to optimize the jailbreak process.
* As TaiG has been doing for some time now, they are suggesting that jailbreakers stick to the public versions of the TaiG tool, and leave the beta versions to testers. In this post, you’ll find the download links for both the publicly available version of TaiG and the beta version.
* To download TaiG 2.4.1 (the public edition) or the new 2.4.3 beta, you can head over to our downloads page.
* Here is the full change log for TaiG 2.4.3 beta:
* As you can see, there’s not much there, but it’s safe to assume that this update makes the jailbreak more efficient, and perhaps even faster.
* As a side note, it’s now possible to jailbreak the iPod touch 6th generation, which just launched yesterday.
* What do you think about TaiG’s beta updates? Are you glad to see them taking this approach?
