* As a blogger, I manipulate a lot of photos and images. One of my daily routine consists in resizing some images we use on iDB to either reduce their size or simply make sure they fit right on the site.
* There are many different ways you can quickly resize several images at once on your Mac. You can use an Automator workflow or download one of the many apps available to do that job. Or, if you want to quickly resize several images on the fly without too much trouble, you can simply do the following.
* Step 1: Select all the images you want to resize.
* Step 2: Right click on them and select “Open With Preview.”
* Step 3: In Preview, go to Edit > Select All.
* Step 4: Once all images are selected, go to Tools > Adjust Size.
* Step 5: Enter the width or height value to resize your photos to your liking. If you’re only going to resize the width for example, make sure “Scale Proportionally” is selected. This will ensure that your images are proportionally resized.
* Step 6: Save and close.
* That’s all there is to it. If you’re batch resizing images on a regular basis, I’d really suggest either downloading an app to do the job for you, or simply create an Automator workflow on your Mac. That will save you the trouble of repetitive tasks.
