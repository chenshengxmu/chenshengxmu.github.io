* A few days ago we reported about a “big surprise” to come in the next version of GreenPois0n. At the time, we speculated it could be a baseband downgrade that would allow for an easier unlock.
* The surprise was revealed today by JayWalker, who is apparently helping out the Chronic Dev Team with GreenPois0n. I hope you didn’t have your hopes too high up there because you’re going to be disappointed as JayWalker confirmed that the surprise is custom animated boot logos…
* The current plan is for this animation to be available for your boot animation via Cydia. Additionally you will have source to make your own.
* A video was also posted on YouTube. Spoiler alert: this is a boring video! Skip to 1.49 to see the animated logo work for just about a second.
* So, was this the big surprise you were expecting?
* [Thanks Benjy]
