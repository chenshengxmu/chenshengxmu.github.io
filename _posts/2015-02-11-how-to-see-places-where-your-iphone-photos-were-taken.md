* I was looking for a very specific picture a few days ago and I couldn’t find it while looking into my Camera Roll. Then I remembered that instead of looking for this photo in the Camera Roll, I should look it up by location where that photo was taken. Indeed, even though I wasn’t sure on what day I had taken this pic, I knew exactly where I took it.
* With that information in mind, I was quickly able to pull up that photo on a map, thanks to a neat little feature of the Photos app, assuming of course you allow the Camera app to use your location and tag your photos with GPS coordinates.
* Not only viewing your photos on a map can be helpful, as it was in my case, but it is also a nice way to “travel” again to all these places you’ve been to.
* In this post, we’ll show you how you can visualize the location where your photos were taken directly from the Photos app.
* Step 1: Launch the Photos app, and go to the Albums tab.
* Step 2: Look for the album called Places and tap on it.

* Step 3: This will bring up Apple Maps, with stacks of photos placed on the various location where they were taken. You can then tap on each stack to see those photos. Obviously, you can always zoom in and out on the screen to view photos from different locations.
* Since having my iPhone 7, I only spent time in California and Mexico, so there isn’t much to see here. But if you use iCloud Photo Library, or if you have a large collection of photos taken over the course of several years and locations, this feature is a nice way to travel back to the different places you went to.
