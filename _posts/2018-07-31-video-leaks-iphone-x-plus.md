* Just days after images leaked, there’s now a video purportedly showing dummy units for two of Apple’s three upcoming iPhone models. Posted by serial leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, the hands-on video shows the forthcoming 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus” and 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.
* The video, which was provided by Tigermobiles.com, clearly shows the fundamental differences between each model, starting with the dual-lens rear camera on the iPhone X Plus and single-lens on the 6.1-inch model. Additionally, a steel frame is visible on the 6.5-inch model vs. aluminum on the less expensive 6.1-inch variant.
* This fall, Apple’s expected to launch three new iPhones. In addition to the two models mentioned above, a second-generation 5.8-inch OLED iPhone X is also planned. The LCD model is expected to launch in multiple colors including gray, white, blue, red, and orange. The 6.5-inch model is supposed to be available in black, white, and gold.
* Apple’s likely to price the 6.1-inch iPhone at around $700 versus $999 for the new iPhone X Plus. The second-gen iPhone X should be priced at $899.
* New iPhones should be announced in early September, alongside at least two new iPad Pro models and a fourth-generation Apple Watch.
