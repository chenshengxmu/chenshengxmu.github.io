* Molto is a mail client designed for mobile access to your digital correspondences. Check your messages, send and receive communications, and experience email in a whole new way…
* This app was created to incorporate your productivity needs with entertainment and information consumption. You may be checking mail, but the app turns your messages into media. Your messages look more like a blog roll than an inbox with images the front and center of each item.

* In addition to a clean and interesting-looking inbox, you can access your most used contacts quickly from the All Stars list in the menu screen. Send emails with one tap or check your most recent interactions with them. The smart contacts design makes it seem like you are chatting with friends, instead of emailing.
* Smart filters divide your emails into different folders so you can stay focused on important correspondences, leaving others for a later date. Messages are viewed in full-screen to give you a rich experience.
* Link your Molto app with Facebook and view your correspondences like you would see their timeline. Emails come to life with more imagery when you can see your friends’ pictures while sending them a message.
* Filter your inbox view by accessing messages that are personal, social, or services to weed out and prioritize your email productivity.

Other actions are easily triggered by touch gestures. Swipe to the right to delete emails. Swipe to the left to select multiple emails to star, move, or delete.
