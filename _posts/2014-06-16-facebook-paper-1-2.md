* Facebook has just pushed a massive update to its Paper for iPhone app, bringing out a host of much-needed features, starting with the ability to edit your profile picture and cover photo.
* The free application now allows you to view photo tags, too, and use mentions to tag friends and let them know about the story. You can explore hashtags to see all the related posts, tilt the phone to explore every detail of the photo, tap-and-hold text to copy it from a post you’re reading, change your audience after you post and more…
* Here’s what’s new in Paper 1.2:
* • Editing your profile pic and cover photo: Want to freshen up your profile? Tap your current profile picture or cover photo to choose new images, resize, crop and update them right in Paper. Voila! • Photo tags: To see who’s tagged in a photo, tap the arrow and then choose View Photo Tags. You can even zoom in and tilt your phone to explore all the tags in a photo. • Mentions: Now when you start typing a friend’s name in a post, you can tag them to let them know about the story. Mentions in comments also work more smoothly, so it’s easier to let specific people know about what you’ve said or shared. • Trending section: This new section gives you a real-time view of topics people are talking about on Paper so you can explore them in depth. Just tap the Trending label at the top of any story in the section to see related stories from other sources. • Hashtags: Paper now has hashtags so you can tap a hashtag like #tbt and see all the related posts. • Tilt to explore all your photos: Now you can zoom in on any photo to view it fullscreen and tilt the phone to explore every detail. • Copy text: Now you can tap-and-hold text to copy it from a post you’re reading. Then paste and share the text wherever you like. • Change your audience after you post: We always want to help you share your stories with just the right people. Just tap the name of the audience to change between sharing publicly or with just your friends. • Performance and speed: We’ve been making improvements so stories and photos show up even faster. Enjoy!
* Paper is free in the App Store.
* The app is iPhone only and requires iOS 7.0 or later.
* Earlier this morning, Facebook said users of its iPad app in the United States can take advantage of a new experimental feature that adds a new games and trending content sidebar in landscape mode.
