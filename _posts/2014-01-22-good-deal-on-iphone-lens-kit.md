* If you’re an avid iPhone photographer and find that the handset’s tiny lens just isn’t cutting it anymore, there are a number of add-on lens kits to choose from. Olloclip makes several, Sony makes one, and there are countless options from lesser-known brands.
* These kits usually only contain a couple of lenses, but a company called Bazaared is taking things a step further with its Ultimate iPhone Lens Kit. It includes 5 lenses, a tripod and carrying case, and it’s being heavily discounted right now over at Stack Social…
* First things first, here’s what’s included in the bundle:
* And here’s a promotional clip showing the accessories in action:
* Finally, here are a few sample photos of what the lenses can do:

* Normally, buying each accessory included in this bundle would cost you $199. But for a limited time (9 days from the time of this posting), deal site Stack Social is offering the package for just $69. That’s a hefty 65% discount, and it even includes free shipping.
* The case and lens included in the bundle are made for the iPhone 5 and 5s only. There are no refunds but the product does come with a 90-day manufacturer’s warranty. Available in the US, Canada and several other countries. For more details, click here.
