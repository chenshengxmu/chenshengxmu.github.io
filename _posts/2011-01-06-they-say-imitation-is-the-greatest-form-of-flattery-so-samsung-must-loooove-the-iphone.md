* I mean, really? Did Samsung just blatantly copy the iPhone 4 like that? Okay, to be fair the camera angle of this shot doesn’t tell the whole picture, but still, that’s some sincere flattery that Samsung’s dishing out right there.
* Say hello to the Samsung TV Control Remote. Yes, that’s a remote control… for your television. I know, it looks almost exactly like a phone, but Samsung swears that the only thing this puppy will be talking to is your TV…
* I have to admit, I was taken aback when I first spied a pic of this pho…err, remote, but seeing additional shots on Samsung’s official CES website helped sort my confusion.

* You see, upon seeing further press images, it’s obvious that it’s not a total rip-off of the iPhone; it actually looks as if an iPod Touch 4G and a Samsung Galaxy S had… kids? Mommy, I’m confused.

* And if its looks weren’t enough, the TV Control Remote can do quite a few things that smart phones can do, such as YouTube, Skype, Music, etc.
* What do you think? Blatant rip off, or the absolute sincerest form of flattery?
