* A recent university study shows that the iPad helps students succeed in school. Unsurprisingly, the research found that iPad-equipped students not only excel in everyday learning of material, but that students with iPads also do better on tests.
* Unfortunately, research has still not discovered how an iPad can write your term paper for you…
* Results from Abilene Christian University show that the iPad helps students learn more effectively.
* The results were shared with TUAW:
* “In one study, students who annotated text on their iPads scored 25% higher on questions regarding information transfer than their paper-based peers. In a separate project covering iPad usage patterns, two researchers studying ACU’s first all-digital class discovered that the iPad promotes “learning moments” and helps students make more efficient use of their time. Grad students working in an online program reported a 95% satisfaction rate for online iPad-based coursework. As far as the ACU studies are concerned, the iPad in education is a success story.”
* Apple has touted the iPad as a learning tool in commercials and promotion materials, with a vibrant section of the App Store dedicated to educational apps that help students and teachers alike. Apple’s iWork productivity for iOS has also been lauded as a huge draw for students to compose documents, spreadsheets and presentations on the iPad.
* The iPad’s long battery life and plethora of helpful reference and productivity apps make it the optimal companion for the busy college student.
* We’re curious to hear how you’re using the iPad in school. Do you rely on the device daily for creating documents and completing assignments for school, or do you mostly use it for content consumption? What apps do you use? Sound off in the comments below!
