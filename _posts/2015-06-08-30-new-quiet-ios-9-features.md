* During Apple’s WWDC keynote this morning, it offered up a preview of iOS 9. It discussed a number of major new features in the upcoming OS update, including a smarter Siri, improved Maps and better battery life.
* But as usual, there are a number of new features in iOS 9 that Apple didn’t really talk about today. The slide you see above gives you an idea of what some of those features might be.
* Sure they briefly talked about some of these things on stage, such as Wireless CarPlay and Swift 2, but a lot of them went unmentioned. Most of these additions are aimed at developers, but they will still have an impact on users through third party apps and games.
* Stay tuned to iDB for more iOS 9 coverage.
