* Ian Beer’s newly-released tfp0 exploit for iOS 11.3.1 ignited a lot of hope for a corresponding jailbreak tool, and it shouldn’t be long before jailbreak tool developers like CoolStar are able to deliver a functional product to the public masses.
* But Beer hasn’t stopped there; the renowned security researcher shared a new proof-of-concept VFS exploit dubbed ‘empty_list’ on Twitter this Wednesday that seems to be facilitating innovative works in the jailbreak community.
* Just after Beer shared his empty_list exploit, developer Abraham Masri (@cheesecakeufo) came forward with Houdini beta 3r1, which provides a semi-jailbreak experience on iOS 11.3.1 devices without the need for a paid developer account through Apple.

* Notably, this semi-jailbreak doesn’t install Cydia or let you download jailbreak tweaks, but it does let you customize your device beyond stock parameters with built-in configurations. You can learn more at the Houdini Github page.
* Geosn0w was another developer who took full advantage of Beer’s empty_list exploit. With it, he ported his Osiris jailbreak so that it would work on iOS 11.2.x/11.3.x devices without the need for a paid developer account.

* And yes, even Jonathan Levin (@Morpheus______) had something to add after teasing compatible updates for LiberiOS and LiberTV.

* But don’t hold your breath for Cydia support, as Levin and Cydia don’t exactly… get along.
* As for those that are waiting on CoolStar to finish up with Electra for iOS 11.2.x-11.3.1, it seems as though Beer’s empty_list exploit could help it materialize sooner rather than later. But it’s too early to tell at this point in time given the limited information available.
