* Apple’s mobile payment service is coming to Brazil later in 2018.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook broke the news during yesterday’s earnings call with Wall Street analysts and investors, saying the service will be launching in Brazil “in the coming months.” He stopped short of giving an exact date for the launch of Apple Pay in Brazil.
* The official webpage for Apple Pay in Brazil is now live on Apple’s website, revealing customers will be able to add Visa, Mastercard and Itau credit cards to the Wallet app on their iPhone.
* Apple Pay has seen 50% year-over-year growth in US merchant adoption and is now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two-thirds of the country’s top 100 retailers. Global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year.
* Cook remarked:
* Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a concert at London’s Wembley Stadium or buy a souvenir in Yosemite National Park. In the US, we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and it’s off to a terrific start.
* Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely; to split a bill, pay someone back, or send last minute gift right from the Messages app.
* The mobile payment service is currently available in 20 markets.
