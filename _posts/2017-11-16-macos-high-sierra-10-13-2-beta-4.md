* Apple on Thursday seeded a fourth beta of macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 to its registered developers and members of the paid developer program, with a matching public beta coming shortly to those who are enrolled in Apple’s Beta Software Program.
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 beta 4 (build 17C79a) can be installed on a compatible Mac running an appropriate Apple beta configuration profile through the Updates tab in Mac App Store.
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 brings support for introductory pricing option for subscription apps following the recent release of macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 which brought new emoji to the macOS operating system as well as important security fixes.
* We’ll report back if we discover any noteworthy outward-facing feature changes in the new beta. In the meantime, you can report your own discoveries by shooting us an email at tips@iDownloadBlog.com or reach out to @iDownloadBlog on Twitter.
