* Good news today for folks looking to score a fourth gen iPad, or iPad mini, on the cheap. Apple has, for the first time, listed refurbished units of both of the tablets for sale on its website.
* The discounts aren’t significant—up to 9% off of minis, and 10% off of 4th-generation iPads, depending on the configuration—but they’re good enough to knock $50 off of some models…
* First noted by MacRumors, the two tablet models surfaced in Apple’s webstore this morning in various types and sizes. Unfortunately, the selection seems pretty limited at this point.
* Some of the current offerings:
* For a little context, Apple rarely discounts its newer devices outside of the holiday season. So anytime deals like this pop up—yes even on refurbished models—the inventory doesn’t usually last long.
* It’s also worth noting that Apple’s refurbished units are highly regarded in the world of consumer electronics. They come with brand new batteries and backs, and the same one-year Apple warranty.
* What do you think, deal or no deal?
