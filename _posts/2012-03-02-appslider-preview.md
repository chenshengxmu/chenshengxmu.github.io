* Do you have a couple of apps that you just can’t live without? Do you find yourself wishing for a way to launch them directly without hitting your Home screen?
* If you fit the above criteria, then check out this video preview of AppSlider. This is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that lets you specify two app shortcuts for your Lock screen…
* Configuring your favorite two apps is just a a matter of visiting the settings panel for AppSlider located within the Settings app.
* For those wondering how this works when you have a passcode enabled, don’t worry; it respects the passcode security and it won’t launch an app until the passcode is entered successfully.
* AppSlider is in development by Ron Melkhior, and should be available for free on Cydia in the near future. We’ll let know know once it’s available.
* What do you think of AppSlider thus far?
