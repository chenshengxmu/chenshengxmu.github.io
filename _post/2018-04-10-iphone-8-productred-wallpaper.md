* Yesterday, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus received a PRODUCT(RED) treatment.

* These gorgeous-looking phones mark Apple’s first-ever (RED) devices featuring a sleek black face rather than the less attractive white faceplate on the iPhone 7 PRODUCT(RED) edition.
* The wallpaper you see embedded right below is based on Apple’s official marketing image for the iPhone 8 PRODUCT(RED) series and is surely to look awesome on your iPhone X’s edge-to-edge OLED panel with its deep blacks and vibrant reds.
* You can find more original work from iDownloadBlog’s regular wallpaper contributor AR72014 via his DeviantArt gallery or dribbble account, which is where we pulled the ones below.
