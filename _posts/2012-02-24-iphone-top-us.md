* The iPhone has seen an enormous amount of success worldwide. Apple announced during its fiscal Q1 2012 earnings report that the iPhone sold a total of 37 million units in one quarter. Ranked the third phone manufacturer in the world, Apple is continuing to sell an abundance of iPhones.
* When it comes to iPhone sales in the US, Apple sold the top three smartphones in 2011, according to a new report released by ComScore. The iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 4S found their way into the most hands of consumers…

* So why isn’t the iPhone 4S ranked first? Remember the iPhone 4S launched October 14th, 2011, only giving the handset three months to rack up sales. In that three month period, the iPhone 4S earned an impressive spot at third most sold phone in the US.
* The iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS are obvious for the one and two spot, being on the market during 2011 for a total of nine months. Being priced at $99, people saw the iPhone 3GS as a cheaper alternative to the iPhone 4.
* Once the iPhone 4S was launched in October, people saw the iPhone 4 as a cheaper alternative, also at $99. For those who weren’t looking to spend too much, they could also choose from the iPhone 3GS for $50.
* It’s interesting to see RIM’s BlackBerry Curve, most likely popular in the corporate world, earning the fourth ranked spot. Only one Android phone was found to be in the top five, the first 4G device — Sprint’s EVO 4G.
* Yesterday, research group NDP released numbers indicating that Apple’s iPad was also the top tablet in the US. Amazon’s Kindle Fire trailed in second place.
* For now, it appears Apple will remain king with device sales in the US. With the iPad 3 coming next month and rumored iPhone 5 coming in the summer, expect Apple to have another impressive year.
