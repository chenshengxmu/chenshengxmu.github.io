* Samsung on Friday posted a new anti-iPad commercial on its YouTube channel. First spotted by iGeneration, the ad at first blush appears to have borrowed a few cues from the South Korean firm’s original anti-iPhone ad which lampooned people who’d wait in the line for a new iPhone.
* Specifically, the commercial asks supposedly random hipsters on the streets of New York City to take the Galaxy Tab S for a test drive and compare it to the iPad Air.
* As you could imagine, the video emphasizes the Samsung tablet’s thinness and lightness while praising its bright Super AMOLED display versus the iPad Air’s LCD screen.
* The video runs one minute and 22 seconds long, here it is.
* It must be an amazing coincidence that literally each and ever one of street-goers would choose the Samsung device over Apple’s. Even more remarkable is the fact that one guy can tell the subtle 0.9mm difference in depth between the Tab S and the iPad Air, just by looking (it’s “definitely thinner,” he proclaims).
* Another supposed street-goer demonstrates an uncanny ability to pick up the equally subtle 11-gram difference in weight between the Samsung tablet and the iPad Air — again, just by holding the devices.
* The ad makes point of the fact that the Tab S has “one million more pixels than the iPad Air”, with the fine print saying that the Samsung device features 4,096,000 pixels versus 3,145,728 pixels on the iPad Air.
* On the other hand, there’s no denying that Samsung makes “the best screens in the world,” as one of the ad’s characters put it.

* For the sake of completeness, the Galaxy Tab S has a widescreen WQXGA 2,560-by1,600 pixel resolution Super AMOLED display versus the iPad Air’s 2,048-by-1,536 pixel Retina LCD IPS screen.
* The Tab S also features a fingerprint sensor and an 11-hour battery. Samsung touted the tablet’s multitasking capabilities and ability to run two apps side-by-side in previous ads.
