* Apple is working on several upgrades to its Mac product line, reports Bloomberg. Citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, the outlet says the refreshed hardware includes new versions of the iMac, MacBook Air, and the oft-rumored MacBook Pro.
* Also in the pipeline is a new 5K standalone monitor. Apple, of course, discontinued its Thunderbolt Display earlier this year, after years without an update. This time around, Bloomberg says the Cupertino firm is collaborating with LG to build its monitor.
* While the new iPad features aren’t expected until next year, Apple is planning to release some of the new Mac products as soon as October, according to the people. The updated line includes tweaked MacBook Air devices with multi-functional USB-C port technology and iMacs with an option for new graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 
* A thinner MacBook Pro with a flatter keyboard is also in the pipeline, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News earlier this month. The standout feature is a digital function key display above the keyboard that allows for common tasks to be done more quickly for whatever program is being used, according to people familiar with the upcoming product. The feature is internally called the “Dynamic Function Row,” two of the people said, who added that Apple’s official name may differ.
* In addition to the new Mac hardware, Apple is also said to be working on new iPad software features as part of an upgrade for iOS 10. These new features include system-wide annotation and better support for the Pencil, and are slated to arrive next year.
* Earlier today, Apple sent out press invitations for an event on September 7, where it is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 and perhaps a new Apple Watch model. The aforementioned Mac products are believed to be introduced as early as October.
