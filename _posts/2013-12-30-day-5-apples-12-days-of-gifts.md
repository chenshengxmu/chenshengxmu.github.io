* We are now on day 5 of the big 12 Days of Gifts event, meaning Apple has removed the Toca House game and has posted a new free item for download. Today’s gift is the award-winning historical adventure drama Hugo.
* Based on Brian Selznick’s novel ‘The Invention of Hugo Cabret,’ and directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese, Hugo tells the story of a 12-year-old boy living in the walls of the Paris Gare Montparnasse railway station…

* The film includes performances from Jude Law, Sacha Baron Cohen and other stars, and took home 5 Academy Awards. It’s also rated a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and was ranked the number one movie of 2011 by several critics.
* From the iTunes description:
* “Welcome to a magical world of spectacular adventure! When wily and resourceful Hugo discovers a secret left by his father, he unlocks a mystery and embarks on a quest that will transform those around him and lead to a safe and loving place he can call home. Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese invites you to experience a thrilling journey that critics are calling “the stuff that dreams are made of.” *Peter Travers, ROLLING STONE.”
* And here’s a trailer for the film:

* I’ve seen Hugo myself, and while it’s not necessarily my cup-of-tea, it was entertaining. Regardless, the movie should still appease the folks who’ve been complaining that Apple has been cheap with its gifts thus far. It’s normally $15.
* Keep in mind that these gifts typically vary depending on your region, and they’re only available for 24 hours. So if you live in the US (and Canada?), make sure you’ve downloaded the 12 Days of Gifts app so you can grab the free film.
