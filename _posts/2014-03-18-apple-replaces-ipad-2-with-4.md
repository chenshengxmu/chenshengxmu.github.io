* In line with yesterday’s reports, Apple has launched a new 8GB version of its iPhone 5c this morning, and has discontinued the iPad 2. Originally introduced way back in 2011, the tablet has been a mainstay for the Cupertino company in its second-tier tablet slot.
* To replace the retired slate, Apple has resurrected its fourth-generation iPad, which it refers to as the ‘iPad with Retina display.’ The tablet features much better hardware than the iPad 2—with an A6X processor, 1GB of RAM—but will keep the same $399 price tag…
* So now Apple’s iPad lineup looks like this: the original iPad mini starts at $299, the iPad mini with Retina display at $399, the iPad with Retina display at $399, and the iPad Air at $499. It’s worth noting that there’s also a Cellular iPad 4 model available for $529.

* It’s not much else to say here. We saw this coming. It was believed that priced at $399, with 3-year-old technology, the iPad 2’s sales had begun to slide. And by bringing back the iPad 4, all of Apple’s current iOS devices are now compatible with its Lightning plug.
* I still believe that the iPad Air is well worth the extra $100, as the weight, size and performance differences are instantly noticeable. But at the very least, this makes a lot more sense than selling the iPad 2 for $400. It’ll be interesting to see how customers respond.
