* Not only is an iOS 9.2 jailbreak in the works, but it could be here sooner than you think. That all, according to 3K Assistant, a long-time TaiG jailbreak partner. 3K Assistant is the same name of the utility that we always recommend unchecking on TaiG jailbreaks, because it usually has links to pirated content and just seems shady overall.
* According to a report by Stephen Chan, who’s reported on jailbreaking accurately in the past, 3K Assistant has announced that a jailbreak for iOS 9.2 is coming soon via the Chinese microblogging site Weibo.
* Unfortunately, the Weibo post appears to have been removed by 3K Assistant. There is a blog post, however, that goes into detail on the progress of the iOS 9.2 jailbreak. The blog post is in Chinese, but you can use Google Translate to gain a rough translation of the update.
* Be sure to head over to Chan’s blog for screenshots of the original 3K Assistant weibo post.
* What do you think about the prospect of an iOS 9.2 untethered jailbreak? Are you highly anticipating it?
