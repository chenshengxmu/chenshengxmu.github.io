* With Apple Music being one of the main ways to enjoy musical content on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad at this day and age, the days of storing your own music locally on your devices are slowly coming to a halt.
* If you’re finding yourself using Apple Music to stream songs more often than you ever thought you would, and you’d like to remove all the local songs stored on your device in one fell swoop, then you’ve come to the right place.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to remove all of your locally-stored music with just a few taps, rather than having to use iTunes or remove the songs one-by-one via the Music app.
* Because it can be really annoying to go into the Music app and delete all your songs, artists, or playlists one-by-one if you have a lot of them, you might be looking for a faster and easier way to get it done. Fortunately, iOS does have a way to remove everything at once, but you won’t find it in the Music app itself.
* Instead, you can follow these simple steps:
* 1) Launch the Settings app and open the General preferences cell.
* 3) Open the iPhone Storage preferences cell, then select the Music app. Wait for the data to load, which could take a few seconds.

* 4) Scroll down then tap on the Edit button at the right of the Recommendations section.

* 5) Once you’re in editing mode, you’ll see little red deletion badges appear next to the All Songs cell. Tap on it.

* 6) This will reveal a red Delete button you can tap on, and tapping on it will remove all locally-stored music on your device.
* That’s all there is to it! After you tap on that button, all locally-stored music on your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad will be removed from your device and you’ll have all of that storage space re-claimed for anything else you want to use it for.
* Tip: You can also delete individual artists instead of deleting all the songs at once, but this is a feature that can also be accomplished in the Music app itself, unlike deleting all your locally-stored music tracks.
* If you’ve subscribed to Apple Music, then there are few reasons you’d need to have locally-stored music on your device that you synced from iTunes. After all, Apple Music offers many different tracks in its catalogs and there are very few that aren’t offered.
* Apple Music and similar services is where the future of music is headed, and if you want to save your limited internal storage space for other things, migrating from locally-stored music to streamed Apple Music is a great choice.
* Of course, on devices where you can’t always access an internet connection, locally-stored music may still be the better option, so keep this in mind if you live in places where you don’t have access to Wi-Fi or have flaky cellular coverage.
* Do you still sync tracks from iTunes or do you use Apple Music or another streaming service to enjoy your favorite songs? Share in the comments!
