* As promised, Angry Birds maker Rovio today released a new physics-based game that turns the famous formula upside down in that it focuses on the green piggies who must protect the eggs grabbed from the birds. After a string of content updates and sequels, some feel the Angry Birds series has run its course.
* Rovio is clearly banking on the success of Angry Birds here, but Bad Piggies is anything but yet another Angry Birds sequel. Gameplay footage and more info right below…
* Bad Piggies is a fresh new release in its own right, one that took just three hours to take the #1 spot in the U.S. App Store.
* Though the game takes some cues from Angry Birds, namely the hilarious characters, the concept stands on its own.
* The game is set on Piggy Island, where the Bad Piggies are after the eggs again. The game packs in 60 levels, an additional 30 levels unlockable by getting three stars, plus four sandbox levels to challenge your creativity.
* Rather than smash the birds’ structures, Bad Piggies is really a crossover between the Angry Birds universe and Amazing Alex, Rovio’s recently released puzzler that challenges your gray matter with combining various objects and building contraptions to solve levels.
* I’ve only had a chance to play a few Bad Piggies levels this morning and my initial impressions are encouraging. The game feels fresh and different enough from Angry Birds, yet the familiar characters will help fans of the series feel right at home.

* Petri Järvilehto, Rovio’s EVP of Games:
* We’ve never done anything like this. Where Angry Birds was all about destruction, Bad Piggies is all about the joy of construction. It’s not just about getting three stars — in this game, failing is almost as much fun as succeeding.
* At the same time, the puzzles and game mechanics are more interesting than those in Amazing Alex, although not as frustrating. The difficulty curve of Amazing Alex can definitely put off causal gamers: I did not have the patience to play through the entire game (unlike all Angry Birds releases that I used to play over and over a bunch of times).

* Luckily, the puzzles in Bad Piggies are never intimidating. Even if you get stuck, there’s always a handy light bulb icon a tap away to highlight a contraption you must build. All told, those that like puzzlers definitely wont be disappointed.
* Here’s the official trailer.
* And here’s nice gameplay footage, courtesy of our friends over at TouchArcade.
