* Apps’ documents and data stored in iCloud can quickly add up, and depending on the size of your storage plan, you might need to do some cleaning in there from time to time to ensure that you don’t waste any of that precious space. In this post, we’ll show you how to delete documents and data in iCloud.
* Before we get started, a few words of caution about deleting documents and data. Be cautious and aware of what you are deleting. I suggest deleting data for apps you don’t use anymore, or documents you know for sure you won’t need in the future.
* Probably the quickest and easiest way to go at it is to delete these documents and data directly from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.
* Step 1: Go to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage.

* Step 2: Under Documents & Data, tap Show All. Your Documents and Data usage is listed by apps that use the most storage to those that use the least. For each app, you also see how much storage space is being used. As you can see from my screenshots, my apps aren’t taking much storage space but we’ll still delete a few documents and data for this tutorial.
* Step 3: Tap on the app for which you want to delete documents and data stored in iCloud. Then tap the Edit button in the corner.

* Step 4: Tap Delete All, and tap Delete All again to confirm. These documents and data will be instantly removed from iCloud and all of your devices.
* Step 5: Repeat the process for each app.
* Because of the nature of iCloud, you can also access these documents and data directly from your Mac.
* Step 1: On your Mac, go to  > System Preferences > iCloud.
* Step 2: Click on Manage in the lower right corner.

* Step 5: Repeat the process for all the apps you want to clean up.
* Of course, your mileage may vary. In my situation, I do not have much documents and data stored in iCloud worth deleting, so my gain is fairly small. But if you’ve been accumulating a bunch of junk over the years, you might very well be able to recover several GB of data, which can really make a big difference.
