* DockWare is a brand new jailbreak tweak that brings an interesting idea to the table: it lets you access your iOS dock from anywhere, even while within apps. DockWare uses Activator gestures to accomplish this feat, allowing you to both display and hide the iOS dock while on the Home screen or while within apps.
* We’ve taken DockWare for a spin on video in order to show you how it works in action. It’s an interesting tweak, but at $1.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, it probably won’t be for everyone. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside to see what we mean.
* Once you install DockWare, you’ll need to venture over to the Settings apps and find the tweak’s preference panel. From there, you can configure the tweak, including its Activator invocation gesture, to your liking.

* DockWare includes three main preference sections—Global, Home Screen, and Advanced. The Global section allows you to enable the tweak in apps, set the Activator gesture, and establish Autohide settings for the dock. You can choose to disable Autohide altogether by sliding the slider all the way to the left.
* The Home Screen section of the preferences allow you to enable or disable DockWare on the Home screen and select from three different animations for displaying the dock on screen. These animations are there because DockWare allows the remaining icons on the Home screen to take up all of the space, including the space that was normally reserved for the dock.

* The last section, Advanced, lets users establish blacklists on an app-by-app basis. If there is an app that you absolutely know you’d never want to see the dock appear in, you can disable DockWare completely for that app.
* Overall, DockWare does a fairly good job of allowing dock access in any app. The visual aspect and animations could probably stand to be improved, and the look of the dock does clash with many of the apps running on iOS. DockWare is functional, but it looks a little weird when using it—it definitely doesn’t look like it could be a stock part of iOS like some tweaks do.
* Watch the video above, and that should help you determine whether or not DockWare is worth shelling out $1.99 for. What do you think? Sound off in the comments below.
