* EA Mobile has posted a new teaser trailer for its upcoming game “Need for Speed No Limits.” The game is being built by Firemonkeys, the combined teams of Firemint and IronMonkey Studios, who both have racing backgrounds.
* The video features professional rally driver Ken Block, of the Hoonigan Racing Division, playing the new Need for Speed on his iPhone 6. The gameplay footage shown is fairly impressive, flaunting sharp graphics and intense gameplay.
* Not much is known about the game itself, other than of course it’s centered around street racing, with cops to avoid along the way. TouchArcade speculates that it could be lane-based like Asphalt Overdrive, but it’s still unclear thus far.
* EA’s Firemonkeys team features developers responsible for the Real Racing franchise and other Need for Speed mobile titles, so expect No Limits to be a solid racer. EA says that the title is coming soon to both the App Store and Google Play.
