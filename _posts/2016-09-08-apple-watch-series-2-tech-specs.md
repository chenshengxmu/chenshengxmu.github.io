* In this piece, we’ll recap all the technical specifications of the new Apple Watch lineup.
* This post serves not only as an informational piece, but also as an archive for when Apple inevitably removes these specifications from their website years into the future after several new generations of the Apple Watch have been released.
* The tech specs for the new wearable accessory are listed below:
