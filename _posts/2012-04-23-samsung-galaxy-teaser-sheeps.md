* Apple’s frenemy Samsung is gearing up for the upcoming Mobile Unpacked 2012 event due May 3 in London. In order to pique interest, the company posted a new YouTube advert teasing its upcoming third-generation Galaxy smartphone.
* The device is aimed at stealing the spotlight from Apple’s sixth-generation iPhone due later this year. As has been the case with Samsung’s advertising as of late, it subtly likens iPhone users to mindless sheep, but doesn’t refer them directly.
* Instead, the clip wraps up with a line suggesting the Galaxy III smartphone helps one stand out from everyone else, spiced up with an image of sheep. As the iPhone is the iconic handset by the world’s top smartphone maker, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out to whom ‘everyone else’ refers to.
* Check out the teaser video right below and tell us what you think…
* The advert closes by saying:
* With technology that fits in this easily, you can now stand out from… everyone else.
* The ‘everyone else’ being illustrated with the above image.
* The South Korean consumer electronics conglomerate also set up a mini-site with the countdown timer for the upcoming handset. Surprisingly, both the English-language version of the site and its Korean counterpart were unavailable at press time, presumably folding under heavy load indicating high interest.
* Yup, that’s the Mass Effect 2 soundtrack.
* Neither the video nor the mini-site reveal much about the phone, but it’s rumored to be a rehash of the Galaxy SII, packing in a 1.5GHz processor, four-inch AMOLED display and 1GB of RAM.
* The biggest new feature is said to be eye-tracking technology which will use the device’s front-facing camera to detect if your eyes are looking at the screen or when you are writing text.
* The official unveiling is scheduled for the next week’s Unpacked event in London.
* What do you think, am I reading too much into it or is this yet another jab at iPhone fans? And is it fair to say that Samsung in a sense is calling its own customers sheep?
* Or perhaps iOS users isn’t their target market?
* I’m obviously not alone in thinking that Samsung is talking about iPhone users.
