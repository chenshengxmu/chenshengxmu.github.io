* Apple must be planning big announcements for the September 9th media event that members of the press just got an invite to. Not only is the capacity of the Flint Center much larger than Apple’s usual product unveiling venues, but the Cupertino-based company is constructing its own building on the Flint Center grounds as part of the event.
* Jim Dalrymple, a well-plugged in Apple blogger, theorizes this extra building could be the hands-on area that Apple typically has for attendees after the event. Also of note, security is very tight around the construction and no one can see what’s going on inside. What could Apple be so keen on hiding, even after so many iPhone leaks? Well a wearable of course. Remember, the original iPad was unveiled to no part leaks.
* The Flint Center has an approximate capacity of 2,405 attendees (not counting the new structure Apple has built). Compared to the Yerba Buena Center that has a capacity of 757 and the Apple Campus Town Hall that has a capacity of 301, Apple has reserved a lot more extra space for the September 9th event than previous events. The Flint Center was the place late co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the Mac in 1984.

* Apple is believed to unveil two new iPhones at the event – a version with a 4.7-inch screen and one with a 5.5-inch screen. Furthermore, Recode reports Apple has plans to finally take the wraps off a wearable at the event, as well. Wouldn’t it makes sense for Apple to pack the event for its next-generation product?
* Interestingly, Gizmodo was invited to the event, its first Apple event invite since it was banned from Apple events after its infamous iPhone 4 leak in 2010. It sounds like Apple is trying to fill the room with press, alongside Apple employees who fill the room with cheering.
