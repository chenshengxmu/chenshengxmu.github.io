* Even though it was initially met with some criticism, Apple’s newest handset hasn’t had any problems flying off the shelf. Yesterday morning, the Cupertino company reported that it sold a staggering 4 million iPhone 4S units during opening weekend.
* Not only did the three day sell-a-thon set a company best for Apple in handset sales, it also helped US-based carriers like Sprint and AT&T set single-day sales records. And it looks like the smartphone’s unprecedented run is only just beginning…
* The fastest selling consumer device in history is the Kinect accessory for the Xbox 360 console. Microsoft sold a mind-numbing 8 million Kinect units in the product’s first 60 days on the market. The funny thing is, Apple is halfway there after opening weekend.
* Next week, the company is scheduled to launch the iPhone 4S in 22 new countries. When you consider that it only launched in 7 countries initially, it’s feasible to think that the iPhone 4S could dethrone the Kinect as the fastest selling consumer device ever.
* Call it Fanboism, call it the Jones effect, call it whatever you want. Apple’s winning.
