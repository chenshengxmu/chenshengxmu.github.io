* With Moga’s upcoming Ace Power iPhone game controller recently shown in leaked photos and Logitech now selling its $99 PowerShell controller, other accessory makers have taken notice and are now working on their own Made for iPhone (MFi) iOS 7 game controllers.
* One of them is Razer, a privately-held American accessory maker that specializes in high-performance hardware specifically marketed to gamers. On Friday, Twitter user @evleaks leaked what appeared to be a legitimate press shot of Razer’s upcoming iOS 7 game controller called the Kazuyo…
* As you can see for yourself, the controller layout features a directional pad on either side, in addition to shoulder buttons. What sets the Razer Kazuyo apart from Logitech’s Powershell and Moga’s Ace Power controller is the ability to tilt the iPhone or iPod touch up when docked for better viewing angles.
* There also appears to be a grille underneath the Home button, indicating a speaker.
* Here’s another look at the Kazuyo.

* We have no information about possible pricing or availability, but we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop and report here as soon as we find out more about the Kazuyo.
* Razer always does great gaming peripherals and I find the Kazuyo rather convincing. It the meantime, games developers have begun implementing support for these MFi iPhone controllers via a set of new APIs in iOS 7.

* Currently, only a handful of games support MFi controllers, such as Gameloft’s Asphalt 8: Airborne, which supports standard controllers and Dungeon Hunter 4 and Gangstar Vegas which implement support for both standard and extended controllers.
* Other titles like Bastion and Dead Trigger 2 have been recently updated with iOS 7 game controller support, with more to come as other accessory makers start releasing their own  standard and extended controllers.
