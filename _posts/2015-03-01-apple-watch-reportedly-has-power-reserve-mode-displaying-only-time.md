* The New York Times reports the Apple Watch will feature “Power Reserve” functionality, in order to stretch the wearable’s battery longer and make for less frequent charging.
* Apple has said the watch battery is estimated to last a full day, requiring a user to charge it at night, similar to a smartphone. The low-power mode will display the time only, the report says, and will be able to do so on even very little battery.
* The “Power Reserve” mode sounds like it essentially cuts off all functionality of the Apple Watch, including syncing with the iPhone for notifications and data, and serves up the most important functionality of a watch, instead.
* The rest of the New York Times’ report details how Apple plans to get people to buy into yet another product category that it hopes to dominate. One other interesting anecdote: apparently Apple disguised the Apple Watch as a Samsung watch during testing before it was announced to the public.
* Apple sent an invitation to members of the media last week for a March 9 media event, where the company is expected to unveil more details of its new wearable.
