* Rumors regarding the iWatch have reached a fever pitch this week. We’ve heard 3 reports in just the past 2 days, and we’ve got another one to add to the list this morning. It seems that everyone is interested in Apple’s highly anticipated wearable.
* Today’s report comes from Chinese website Laoyaoba, which claims that Apple has finalized the design and specifications of the watch, and is now awaiting FDA approval. The site also says that the device will include blood glucose and sweat sensors…
* GforGames passes along the Laoyaoba report:
* According to the latest reports coming from the Chinese media (citing “Apple insiders”), iWatch’s development has already been completed (meaning design, technical specs, features, etc). However, the gadget is being held back (aka is not being manufactured yet) because it needs to be certified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
* Much like the previous rumors have suggested, this new reports suggests that the iWatch will include a wide range of biometric sensors on-board, including heart rate, blood pressure and blood glucose sensors.
* Additionally, the site says that Apple has also developed an in-house sensor for the iWatch capable of analyzing a person’s sweat. The watch will feed this and other data it collects into iOS 8’s Health app, which a user can then share with their doctor.

* Yesterday, Reuters reported that the iWatch would feature wireless charging and a 2.5-inch display. Two other reports added that the watch will come in multiple designs, and that Apple has recruited a handful of pro athletes to test its fitness capabilities.
* It’s believed the so-called iWatch will go into mass production within the next few months, ahead of a widely expected October unveiling. Price tag, non-health related capabilities, and several other details about the device are still unknown at this time.
