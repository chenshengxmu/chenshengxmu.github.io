* Apple tonight released a minor update for its iTunes desktop client, bringing the app to version 11.2.1. The update doesn’t appear to offer up any new features, but it does seem to fix the hidden /Users folder bug.

* Users can update to the latest version of iTunes by opening the app and selecting > iTunes > Check for Updates, or by launching the Mac App Store and selecting the ‘Updates’ tab. The download is a hefty 233MB.
