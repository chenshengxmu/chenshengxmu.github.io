* Apple may unveil its so-called iWatch sooner than expected, according to Daring Fireball’s John Gruber. In a new blog post this afternoon, the well-connected Apple pundit casually mentions that the Cupertino company plans to announce its “wrist wearable thing” next month.
* Gruber’s claim contradicts previous reports from various outlets, which have all suggested that the iWatch would land in October. But given his near perfect track record in predicting Apple plans, it’s certainly possible that we could see more than bigger iPhones in September…
* Responding to a Verge story today on the Moto 360 charging dock, Gruber wrote:
* It looks like Motorola’s designers tried to draw as much attention as they could to the 360’s stupid flat-tire display shape. The only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn’t even ship until after Apple announces their wrist wearable thing next month.
* According to Recode’s John Paczkowski, Apple is planning a media event for Tuesday, September 9. Paczkowski also has a great track record in Apple event predictions, and is one of the reporters calling for an October iWatch event, so it’s tough to choose which thread to follow.
* Admittedly, we’ve heard a lot of conflicting information regarding Apple’s new wearable device. What we do know, though, is that the firm has put together quite the team of fashion and medical experts for the project, and it’s expected by many to be the company’s “next big thing.”
* Update: John Gruber has clarified that he doesn’t have any information on Apple’s release plans, and the above statement was simply part of a joke.
