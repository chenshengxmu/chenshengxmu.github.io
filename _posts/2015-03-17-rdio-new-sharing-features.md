* Here’s a quick rundown of today’s enhancements.
* Share Replies This new share improvements lets you follow any conversation more easily than before, by hitting the Reply button when a friend shares music with you to let them know what you think.
* Smarter Sharing Finding friends to share music with has become a tad easier, thanks to the new share icon. Available on any album, playlist or station page, smarter sharing using the search filter to help you find a friend to share your music moment with. This feature is also available by tapping and holding on any song.
* Tweet the Artist Share a song to Twitter now automatically injects the artist’s handle in your tweet so they know you’re listening along.
* These new capabilities are now available on Rdio’s updated iOS app and in the web interface, and are “coming soon” to Android.
