* First iPhone SE units assembled in India have gone on sale in many cities in the country, including the city of Bangalore near which the handset is being assembled in a facility operated by Apple’s contract manufacturer Wistron.
* The Indian Express reported today that the iPhone SE units manufactured in India don’t carry a lower price tag because they are made locally due to Apple’s policy of keeping the pricing more or less the same across the globe. In fact, these phones are “priced the same as other models manufactured in China,” according to The Indian Express.
* Currently, a small trial run of limited iPhone SE units has been produced. Although the handset is now selling in many Indian cities, customers interested in the handset may not be able to get their hands on one until Wistron ramps up production.
* These phones have “Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in India” printed on their back.
