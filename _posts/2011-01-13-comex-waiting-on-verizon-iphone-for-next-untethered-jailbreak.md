* According to a recent tweet from well-known iPhone hacker Comex, the untethered jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 might be released after the Verizon iPhone’s debut. In reply to a tweet asking if Comex would wait for iOS 4.3 to release his untethered jailbreak, Comex replied:
* “I don’t know, I think I’m waiting for the Verizon iPhone.”
* So far, the only untethered jailbreak method available for 4.2.1 is the iPhone Dev-Team’s redsn0w 0.9.7beta6 which is currently Mac only…
* If you were patiently waiting for this untethered jailbreak, it looks like you might have to wait a little longer.
* What’s your take on all this?
