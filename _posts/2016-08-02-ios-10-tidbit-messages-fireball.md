* The Digital Touch interface made its debut on the Apple Watch in April 2015. With iOS 10, Apple is bringing Digital Touch features to the Messages app and it does so much more than its wrist counterpart was capable of at launch.
* With Digital Touch, you can doodle over live video, adorn your messages with animated kisses, digital taps and auto-dissapearing drawings and even send animated hearts and broken hearts to other people.
* Today, we’re taking a closer look at another nifty feature in iOS 10 Messages: the ability to express your angst or anger by shooting virtual fireballs at your recipient(s).
* To send a fireball via iOS 10 Messages, do the following:
* 1) Launch Messages on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10 or later.
* 2) Create a new message and then tap the Digital Touch button, it’s the middle icon next to the text entry field.
* 3) Take the Digital Touch interface full screen by tapping the arrow in the lower right corner. This is an optional step.
* 4) On devices without 3D Touch, tap and hold with one finger until a fireball is created. On devices with 3D Touch, press the Digital Touch pad with one finger instead of tapping.
* 5) You can continue holding the finger to see the looping fireball animation. Let go of the finger to shoot the fireball to the contact.

* Like other Digital Touch effects, you can send fireballs on the black background or apply it to a photo or video. For those wondering—yes, you can send fireballs using the Digital Touch feature in Messages on the Apple Watch, too.
