* Although the Verizon iPhone’s official launch is slated for February 10th, Verizon is giving existing customers the first shot at the device by offering pre-orders.
* These pre-orders are slated to start at 3AM EST on February 3rd, but the good news is that you don’t have to change out of your pajamas to do so.
* All pre-orders will be registered online via the company’s ‘My Verizon’ site; therefore, we advise you to set up an account in advance if you are not already registered…

* Since inventory will be limited, it’s imperative that you don’t waste precious time setting up your online account on the 3rd; you’re going to want to login and pre-order as fast as you can in order to ensure yourself one, otherwise you may be waiting until the 10th.
* Apparently, Verizon has also decided to allow AT&T iPhone owners to trade in their devices, although we’re still not clear how that’s going to play out. Here is the price list that displays what you can expect to receive:
* iPhone 2G – 16GB: $60 iPhone 3G – 16GB: $105 iPhone 3Gs 32GB: $160 iPhone 4- 16GB: $280 iPhone 4 – 32GB: $360
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone, especially if it’s unlocked, I’m sure you can snag more than that by selling it yourself.
* The date is getting closer folks; it’s almost decision time. What will you do?
