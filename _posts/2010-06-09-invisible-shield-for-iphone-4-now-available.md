* The new iPhone 4 isn’t even out yet that screen protection is already available for it. Zagg was quick to update its product line with a new Invisible Shield for iPhone 4.
* Yesterday I wrote an article in which I was mentioning the iPhone 4 will probably cost more in screen protection since it is covered with glass on the front and the back. I’m not big on screen protection but for testing the Invisible Shield in the past on my 3GS, I can tell it’s great quality products.
* Invisible Shield is so tough that Zagg backs it with a lifetime guarantee. So, if it ever does wear or scratch, they will replace it for free, for the life of your device.
