* The same source that posted images allegedly showing a claimed iPhone 7 chassis alongside a bunch of SIM trays in Apple Watch-like Space Black finish has now re-published a new photo that seems to picture iPhone 7 logic boards, obtained from Ming Technology on Weibo. Prolific leakster Steve Hemmerstoffer also posted his own iPhone 7 motherboard images.
* GeekBar also posted their own photos of the iPhone 7 motherboard.
* GeekBar is the same Chinese repair shop that posted photos and a 25-second vide showing off a supposedly working iPhone 7 prototype running Apple’s internal testing software and the stock Camera app.

* Little, if anything, can be gleaned from these photos because it’s a bare logic board without any chips on it. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus should run an Apple-designed ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip produced using TSMC’s cutting-edge ten-nanometer manufacturing process that should result in faster graphics and processing power and lower power consumption.
* The logic board’s layout closely matches that of prior iPhone models. And if what we’re seeing is the real deal, then the iPhone 7 won’t have a dual-SIM system as previously rumored because the photo clearly shows a space for a single SIM tray.
