* The first real-world images taken with the recently introduced iPhone Xs have been released. At one end of the world, travel photographer Austin Mann took photos around Zanzibar. Closer to Apple’s home, former White House photographer Pete Souza released images showing outdoor scenes around Washington, D.C.
* The dual-camera system found on the iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xs Max has been described as the best yet by Apple. New features include Smart HDR that uses multiple technologies and advanced algorithms to add highlight and shadow detail to photos.
* There’s also an enhanced Portrait mode for selfies that adds a precise depth map to keep you in focus against a blurred background. With Depth Control, you can adjust the depth of field after you shoot.
* For his images, which were first posted at PetaPixel, Mann used both of these tools. Examples include those shown above and below.

* He explained:
* Smartphones have turned everyone into a photographer but they haven’t necessarily turned everyone into a “good” photographer. At the same time, the smartphone has also turned everyone into a visual journalist giving us at times an eyewitness account from breaking news events.
* Here are three of Souza’s many images:
