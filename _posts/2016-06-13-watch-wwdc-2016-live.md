* Apple is going to be streaming their WWDC 2016 event live on their website today, and die-hard Apple fans will be tuning into the event from their devices to see what’s new.
* Whether you’ve got a Mac or a PC, or are using your mobile device to stream the media, you can watch it live whether you’re at home or on the go. There are, however, some requirements you will have to meet to be able to do so.
* Here’s everything you need to know about how to stream the WWDC 2016 event live on your devices today.
* As long as you’re using the right web browser on your computer, you can stream the event live whether you’re using a Mac or a PC by visiting the WWDC 2016 page from Apple’s website on the day it goes live.
* iOS devices will only stream the event on certain iOS versions due to Apple’s HLS streaming technology.
* The following setups will work just fine for watching live:
* To watch the event live on an iOS device or your Mac, you can visit the WWDC 2016 page at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST). Once you’re on the website, you can just wait and the event will begin streaming as soon as Apple starts to broadcast it.
* The nice thing about using an Apple device to watch these events is that things tend to work a little more seamlessly.
* To watch WWDC 2016 live on an Android device, you can download the free VLC Media Player app for Android and follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the app from your Home screen and tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream.
* 2) After you’re asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL:
* http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436-b/16faohbadfvoihjbadfvljhbphjb06/master/4500/4500.m3u8?t=YWxpc2FtaXg=
* 3) Tap on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will be playing from your Android device through VLC.
* If you’ll be using a Windows PC and are running Windows 10, you can visit the WWDC 2016 page in your Microsoft Edge web browser at 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST).
* Although it’s not an Apple device, Microsoft Edge supports HLS streaming, and it will work as seamlessly as if you were using Safari on your Mac or iOS device.
* For other Windows PCs running Windows 8.1 and earlier, you can download the free VLC Media Player app on your computer and follow these steps to stream the event live:
* 1) Open the VLC app and go to Media > Open Network Stream from the top of the app’s interface.
* 2) When prompted to enter a source, enter the following URL:
* http://p.events-delivery.apple.com.edgesuite.net/15pijbnaefvpoijbaefvpihb06/m3u8/atv_mvp.m3u8
* 3) Click on the Play button after 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the live stream will play from VLC Media Player.
* For those who will be sitting comfy on their couches and watching from their Apple TV, there is a different process for each the older generations of Apple TV, and the newest one.
* On older Apple TVs (third-generation and earlier), you can tune in from the icon that gets added to your Home screen automatically. For the fourth-generation Apple TV, you will have to download the Apple Events app from the App Store if you desire to watch it live.
* After you get the app on your Apple TV Home screen, you can launch it before 10 A.M. PDT (1 P.M. EST) and the streaming will begin on your TV set automatically.
* There have been a handful of rumors for WWDC 2016, but rumors are just rumors, and it’s anyone’s guess what Apple has planned to unveil at the event today.
* Nevertheless, we might see the next generation of iOS, watchOS, OS X (possibly to be renamed macOS), and tvOS, which will each add new features to the platforms.
* Apple’s WWDC 2016 page is designed to look like code, so there’s a strong possibility that Swift may play a big part in the event.
* In terms of new features, the Mac is expected to gain access to Siri for the first time, while iTunes and Apple Music are each expected to see major redesigns and feature improvements. There haven’t been a whole lot of rumors for iOS or watchOS, so much of the event remains a mystery at the time of this writing.
* Even if you can’t tune in live, you can still check back on Apple’s website, and even YouTube, later on to watch the event. It won’t be live, but it will be just as informative.
