* Apple on Monday launched the first beta of macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 to developers. The build number is 17D20a, and the update can be installed by registered developers using the Mac App Store’s update mechanism.
* Given that macOS 10.13.2 was just released to the public last week, it’s unknown what changes 10.13.3 will bring. We’re currently installing today’s beta and will be sure to report back if we discover anything worth noting.
* See something new in 10.13.3 we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments below!
