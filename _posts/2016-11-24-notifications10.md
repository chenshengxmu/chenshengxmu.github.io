* A ton of people are sticking with their jailbroken iOS 9 devices, but are drooling over the new features and interface changes in iOS 10. Fortunately, a new jailbreak tweak called Notifications10 can help bring some of the iOS 10 look and feel to your jailbroken iPhone.
* Notifications10, as the name suggests, brings iOS 10-style notification bubbles and banners to your jailbroken iOS 9 device.
* The new look and feel, which makes the banner look more bubbly with a bright title bar, will be seen universally throughout iOS. This includes the Lock screen, Notification Center, and even when a banner notification pops up while you’re on the Home screen or in an app.
* As shown above, you can swipe to the right on a notification and you’ll get the same options you would see on an iOS 10 device, including the clear button for dismissing the notification and a button for replying when it’s relevant.
* The same visual effects are applied to your Notification Center widgets:

* Now one thing I want to clear up right off the bat is I was testing this tweak on an iPhone 5s. The tweak is made to look better on larger displays of 4.7 inches and larger, so things look a little crowded on the puny 4-inch display.
* Overcoming that difficulty, you can still get the gist of how the tweak works. The title bars are made brighter and the entire widgets themselves are given the bubbly look like they have in iOS 10’s Notification Center.
* When you install Notifications10, what you see is what you get, as the tweak has no options to configure. Overall, it’s a decent (but not perfect) iOS 10 notification experience mock up for jailbroken devices.
* If you’re interested in giving the tweak a try, you can download it today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $0.99. iOS 9 is required to download and install the tweak.
* Note: Since the tweak is made for larger displays, we don’t recommend it on the iPhone 5, 5s, or SE. It’s intended for the iPhone 6/6 Plus and later. Installing the tweak on the smaller-screened device won’t look as nice.
* What are your thoughts on the attempt to port iOS 10-style notifications over to jailbroken iOS 9 devices? Share in the comments!
