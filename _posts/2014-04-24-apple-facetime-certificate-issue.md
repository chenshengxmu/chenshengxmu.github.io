* After some folks on iOS 6 and older versions of OS X started complaining about being unable to make or receive FaceTime calls on their devices, Apple has responded by releasing an emergency fix for the FaceTime app on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Getting to the root of the problem, the company on Thursday published a support document that casts more light on the issue.
* People have apparently been experiencing FaceTime connection problems due to a bug resulting from a device certificate that expired on April 16, 2014. Luckily, there’s a simple resolution for the problem, one which you may not necessarily like. Hit the jump for the full reveal…
* Apple writes:
* If you started to have issues making or receiving FaceTime calls after April 16, 2014, your device or your friend’s device may have encountered a bug resulting from a device certificate that expired on that date. Updating both devices to the latest software will resolve this issue.
* Yes, upgrade to iOS 7!
* “If you’re using an iOS 7 compatible device and you’re still on an earlier version of iOS, you should update to iOS 7.1 or later,” reads the document.
* Folks who are jailbroken have plenty of reasons to avoid upgrading to iOS 7.1 unless they want to break their jailbreak.
* And what about those who don’t own an iOS 7-compatible device?
* Update to the latest iOS 6.1.6, according to Apple.
* The firm says folks on iOS 7.0.4 or later or iOS 6.1.6 are not affected by this issue, as are not those using the following versions of OS X or FaceTime for Mac:
* Note that even if you update your devices, FaceTime calls will still fail if the iOS device or Mac that you’re trying to connect to isn’t up to date, cautions Apple.
* As for Mavericks Macs, Apple advises installing OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 or later.
* People on OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 or OS X Lion 10.7 should install the latest security updates or update to OS X Mavericks 10.9.
* People on OS X 10.6 should “get the latest version of FaceTime for Mac in the Mac App Store,” Apple writes.
* Apple also offers a guide to troubleshooting FaceTime.
