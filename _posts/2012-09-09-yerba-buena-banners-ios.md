* Apple started prepping for its highly-anticipated iPhone event last week, hanging colorful banners outside of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.
* The company’s venue decorations are typically more interesting than they are insightful. But this time, they may contain clues to its upcoming announcement…
* MacRumors passes along a discovery from a reader that the colorful streaks in Apple’s adornments are made up of stretched iOS icons: Game Center, iTunes and Music.

* As you can imagine, speculation has ensued that this indicates Apple will be unveiling an iPhone with a “stretched” screen next week. The rumor mill has been calling for a larger 4-inch iPhone display for months, pointing to reports and leaked parts for confirmation.
* If that consensus holds true, the new iPhone will feature a taller, but not wider, 4-inch Retina display with a resolution of 1136 x 640 and a ratio close to 16 x 9.
* Banners or not, we are fully expecting to see an iPhone with a bigger display and a number of other changes next week. But we have to admit it was a pretty interesting  find.
* What do you think?
