* More updates from the jailbreak world this evening; as if the anticipation could possibly get any higher.
* The app that contains the exploits used for the iPhone 4S jailbreak is essentially finished and the final touches are being placed on what we can only assume will be the latest version of GreenPois0n.
* Earlier this evening, @planetbeing tweeted that fellow Chronic Dev Team member Nikias Bassen, better known as @pimskeks, has finished the majority of the app that will contain the heavily anticipated iPhone 4S and iPad 2 A5 exploit.
* Weâ€™re testing & fixing problems with the jb app (that @pimskeks finished the majority of at incredible speed). Still needs to be polished.

* Somethingâ€™s approachingâ€¦ ðŸ™‚

* This is all on top of Joshua Hillâ€™s earlier tweet signifying that the jailbreak is absolutely in its final stages, and could be released any moment now.
* Andâ€¦We all await on pins and needles.
