* The official sequel to BioWare’s classic role-playing game set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, Baldur’s Gate, has just launched for the iPad and is now available to download from the App Store, priced at $14.99.
* Basically a 21st century version of the original 2000 release, Baldurs Gate II: Enhanced Edition includes new party members, a seamless multiplayer mode, a bunch of expansions packs such as the Throne of Bhaal and Shadows of Amn, a new combat mission titled The Black Pits 2: Gladiators of Thay as well as a host of other goodies…
* You and your party of skilled adventurers are tasked with defeating the evil wizard Irenicus whilst exploring the vast environments of the Forgotten Realms.
* In terms of the visuals, the team has remastered area artwork from the original renders and revamped everything for full widescreen support.
* From iTunes release notes:
* Kidnapped. Imprisoned. Tortured. The wizard Irenicus holds you captive in his stronghold, attempting to strip you of the powers that are your birthright.
* Can you resist the evil within you, forge a legend of heroic proportions, and ultimately destroy the dark essence that haunts your dreams? Or will you embrace your monstrous nature, carve a swath of destruction across the realms, and ascend to godhood as the new Lord of Murder?
* Here’s the launch trailer.
* Beamdog submitted the game for Apple’s approval nearly a month ago so I’m not sure what took so long, but Trent Oster, creative director for the game, confirmed yesterday on Twitter that it finally went live in the App Store.
* Check out the screenies.
