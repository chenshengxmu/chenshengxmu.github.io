* Although third party apps interface with a paired iPhone in order to run on Apple Watch, an installation does occur when adding apps to the Apple Watch. With this considered, it would only make sense to be able to remove apps from the device as well.
* Fortunately, it’s extremely easy to delete apps from Apple’s wearable. Actually, there are several ways to remove apps from the Apple Watch, and we’ll highlight all of those ways in the following post.

* Step 1: Press the Digital Crown until you see the Home screen Carousel interface
* Step 2: Tap and hold (don’t Force Touch) on an app icon that you wish to remove, and the Home screen will enter wiggle mode
* Step 3: Tap an app that you wish to delete. Apps eligible for deletion will feature an ‘x’ button next to the app icon. Only third-party apps can be removed
* Step 4: Tap Delete App on the confirmation screen
* Step 1: Open the Apple Watch app on iPhone
* Step 2: Tap the My Watch tab
* Step 3: Scroll down and find the app that you wish to remove and tap its panel
* Step 4: Disable the Show App on Apple Watch switch

* Doing either of the above steps will only remove the app from the Apple Watch and not the iPhone. To remove an app from both devices, simply uninstall the app from your iPhone like normal. There is no way to keep the app on the Apple Watch if you want to remove it from the iPhone. If it’s not on the iPhone, then it can’t run on the watch.
