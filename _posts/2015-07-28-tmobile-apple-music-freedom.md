* T-Mobile has added Apple Music to the list of supported streaming services for Music Freedom, an initiative which allows subscribers to stream their favorite songs through services like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and more, over T-Mobile’s cellular network and without burning their 4G LTE data.
* Hailed as T-Mobile’s “last Un-Carrier Amped move of the summer,” Simple Choice customers can now enjoy Apple’s streaming music service without worrying about Apple Music cellular data usage counting against their monthly 4G LTE allowance.
* “Apple Music has become the single most requested new addition to Music Freedom and counts for a full 80 percent of the requests coming in via Twitter,” said T-Mobile CEO John Legere.
* “We’re stoked to unleash Apple Music for T-Mobile Simple Choice customers.”
* The carrier claims its customers stream over 131 million songs per day via Music Freedom, which made its debute a year ago. By comparison, “If AT&T customers streamed that much music, they could be paying upwards of $2.3 billion a year—and that’s not even factoring in overage penalties,” said T-Mobile.
* In addition to Apple Music, Music Freedom supports a bunch of other streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, SoundCloud and SiriusXM.
* You ask, we make it happen. Welcome the newest members to the #MusicFreedom family: http://t.co/Mv7jShdOxUhttps://t.co/KEZMXcdTGu
* — T-Mobile
* Again, with Music Unlimited data charges don’t apply when you listen to music over T-Mobile’s 4G LTE cellular network using any of the supported music streaming apps.
* The full list of as many as 33 streaming music services that are included in Music Unlimited can be found here. The services in Music Freedom cover 95 percent of all music streamed on mobile in the United States.
* Details on Music Unlimited are available on T-Mobile’s website.
* According to streaming statistics Apple shared with right holders, Apple Music has amassed more than ten million subscribers in its first month. The strong uptick is no doubt due to strong marketing push on Apple’s part and a generous three-month free trial.
* To put Apple’s ten million milestone in context, it’s about half of Spotify’s paid user base. Company executives have reportedly set an internal goal of signing up a hundred millionth Apple Music customer by the end of this year.
