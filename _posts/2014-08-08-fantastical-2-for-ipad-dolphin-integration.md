* Flexibits has issued an update to its Fantastical for iPad today, bringing our a few new useful features and enhancements.
* In addition to half a dozen bug fixes and various other fixes and improvements, Fantastical 2.1.1 includes support for Dolphin Browser [free download] and comes with improvements to the app’s handling of lists and reminders.
* Specifically, your list will finally show reminders that have an alert time but not a due date.
* And if you use iOS automation via URL schemes, you can tell other apps to open reminders directly in Fantastical by taking advantage of a new URL handler ‘fantastical2://show?view=reminders’…
* You can tell Fantastical to open external links in Dolphin Browser by navigating to the in-app settings interface and choosing ‘Dolphin Browser’ under the ‘Open Links In’ section, as shown below.
