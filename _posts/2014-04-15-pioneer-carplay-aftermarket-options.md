* A Pioneer customer service representative yesterday said the company’s been looking into the possibility of implementing CarPlay compatibility with both its existing and future products.
* Sure enough, the maker of in-car electronic systems today announced five CarPlay aftermarket options.
* Chances are you’re not rich enough to buy a brand new Ferrari, Mercedes or Volvo just to enjoy CarPlay so these kits will be Godsent to those looking to put CarPlay into older vehicles that officially don’t support Apple’s in-car system…
* Pioneer confirmed via a media release that several of its 2014 in-dash multimedia systems will be available in early-summer for iPhone owners who wish to add CarPlay to their current vehicles.
* CarPlay compatibility will be provided via a simple firmware update to five 2014 NEX in-dash multimedia receivers from Pioneer: the AVIC-8000NEX, AVIC-7000NEX, AVIC-6000NEX, AVIC-5000NEX and AVH-4000NEX.
* All five receivers support CarPlay and include an LCD screen that can be installed in most existing vehicles. It’s interesting that Apple has confirmed to The Verge that Pioneer will be selling these aftermarket receivers.
* Full CarPlay functionality is supported, including navigation via Apple Maps, music podcasts, iTunes Radio, Spotify, Siri voice control for making and receiving calls, reading and responding to text messages and more.
* The touchscreens are said to be more advanced and responsive than previous Pioneer in-dash receivers, with the multimedia systems offering improved sound quality and safety enhancements, on top of embedded entertainment options.
* The $1,400 AVIC-8000NEX, $1,200 AVIC-7000NEX, $900 AVIC-6000NEX, $750 AVIC-5000NEX and $700 AVH-4000NEX are currently available at authorized Pioneer Car Electronics dealers nationwide, including Best Buy, Crutchfield and Car Toys.
* More information about Pioneer’s CarPlay aftermarket solutions is available here.
* If you’re not a Pioneer fan, Alpine’s own $500-$750 aftermarket CarPlay kits are arriving this Fall.
