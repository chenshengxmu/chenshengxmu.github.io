* After launching online orders for its fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple will start selling the new set-top box at its retail stores on Friday, October 30, 9to5Mac learned from sources close to the matter.
* In addition to sales via the Apple Online Store and company-owned retail stores, the new Apple TV is listed for pre-order at other resellers like Best Buy and B&H.
* “Apple retail employees say that stores are beginning to receive shipments to sell at the end of this week, while stores will be re-organized overnight on Thursday to promote the new Apple TV in stores on Friday,” wrote the publication.
* As for other sales channels, Best Buy currently has both 32GB ($149) and 64GB ($199) models available for pre-order, with store inventory expected November 4. The electronics retailer is also offering a two-year AppleCare plan for $29.
* Last week, Apple invited its developers to begin submitting their Apple TV apps ahead of the device’s launch. If you’re in the market for the new box, check out Jeff’s roundup of Apple TV accessories your might like.
